PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Gracious God, what treasures You 
have set before us: a country rich with 
resources, a history founded on faith in 
You and invested in the noble prin-
ciples of the American experiment. 
And yet, we confess that we have al-
lowed these endowments to be de-
stroyed by moths of malice and mis-
direction. We acknowledge before You 
that we have tolerated and even taken 
delight in the corrosive rust of rival-
ries and debate. 
Forgive us for taking for granted the 
precious gifts of life, liberty, and hap-
piness, and letting them slip from our 
care, only to be stolen by pride and 
conceit. 
Call us back to rededicate ourselves 
to the mercy You have shown us time 
and again. May we treasure in our 
hearts the privilege You have given us 
as Americans to serve as stewards of 
Your bounteous love. 
We pray in the strength of Your holy 
name. 
Amen.

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
REPLANT ACT IS PRACTICAL 
LEGISLATION 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
PANETTA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
what I am about to show you are the 
examples of the cycle of destruction 
from the climate crisis in my home dis-
trict on the central coast of California. 
Last year, my district was victim to 
a brutal wildfire season in which al-
most 650,000 acres were burned. What 
was left behind in many of those areas 
is called a burn scar, ground that has 
crusted and is hard for water to pene-
trate. As a result, when it rains, it 
leads to floods, mudslides, and devasta-
tion, including this damage to Highway 
1 in Big Sur, in which water and debris 
flowed down the hills, blocked the cul-
verts, then flowed up over Highway 1, 
and took out the road from that side. 
Now, we know we have a lot of work 
to do when it comes to reducing our 
carbon output. In the meantime, we 
can stop this type of damage with re-
forestation of burn scar areas. 
That is why I will reintroduce the 
REPLANT Act, to fund those types of 
projects, and I plan to work on bipar-
tisan legislation to help manage forests 
to prevent fires and not just suppress 
them. It is that type of reasonable and 
practical legislation that is the founda-
tion for how we in Congress can protect 
our communities and prevent the ef-
fects of the climate crisis. 
f 
TRANSPARENCY IS PART OF GOOD 
GOVERNMENT 
(Mr. POSEY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, trans-
parency has always been a cornerstone 
of good government. Over the past 10 
years, 
we 
have 
made 
important

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

March 1, 2021 
progress toward making Congress more 
transparent and accountable to those 
we serve. 
In 2010, I introduced a resolution call-
ing for a 72-hour period of public avail-
ability before the House could bring a 
bill up for a vote, so Members of the 
House and the public could actually see 
what was in a bill before we were asked 
to vote for it. In 2011, the proposal was 
adopted into House rules as a 3-day 
rule. 
But, sadly, this year’s House rules 
package abolished that rule. It is in-
credibly sad to see that this House is 
moving backward and making govern-
ment less open and less accountable to 
those we were sent here to represent. 
f 
CREATING A COVID–19 VICTIMS 
AND SURVIVORS MEMORIAL DAY 
(Mr. STANTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, last 
week, we mourned half a million Amer-
ican lives lost to the coronavirus. 
Their absence in our communities is 
difficult to comprehend. 
Sadly, many are facing the reality 
that it has now been more than a year 
without their loved ones. Tragically, 
many of them died alone, without 
loved ones to say good-bye. 
To honor and memorialize those lost 
and those impacted by the virus, I in-
troduced a resolution designating the 
first Monday in March as COVID–19 
Victims and Survivors Memorial Day. 
Commemorating this memorial day is 
an important marker for all those af-
fected across the country and to help 
our country heal from this trauma. 
In my home State, this day of rec-
ognition has been pushed by two advo-
cates who lost their fathers to COVID– 
19. Kristin Urquiza and Tara Krebbs 
turned their grief into action and have 
mobilized more than 100 cities and mul-
tiple States to recognize today as a me-
morial day. 
Long after our Nation moves beyond 
this ordeal, we will need to collectively 
recognize all that we have lost and the 
trauma of what we have experienced. 
Together, we can overcome. 
f 
A BILL FOR POLITICIANS, NOT 
PEOPLE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the 
top priority bill of the House of Rep-
resentatives this year for the Demo-
crats seems to be H.R. 1, known as the 
For the People Act. 
What people is this going to benefit? 
For the politicians act, you might call 
it. It helps politicians and hacks like 
The Lincoln Project, not the people. 
For example, if this bill passes, a po-
litical candidate raising approximately 
$800,000 in their campaign under cer-
tain guidelines could have the Federal 
Government match funds up to $6 mil-
lion that could be used for anything 
put into campaign—$6 million of your 
Federal dollars going into a single con-
gressional race under the right condi-
tions. 
These formulas are geared to ratchet 
up from the previous election cycle. As 
we know, campaigns get more expen-
sive each time; so does the match. 
Also, under this bill, the Federal 
Government would hand out $25 vouch-
ers to every voter in three chosen 
States to donate to candidates. How 
much will that cost just to administer 
a program like that? We know the Fed-
eral Government doesn’t do that cheap-
ly, maybe $25 per check to give each $25 
contribution. 
If you hand a bureaucrat a hammer, 
they will see everything as a nail. The 
new system fines more people in order 
to raise funds for this campaign give-
away. The fines will go up, and busi-
nesses will be hurt, all in order to pro-
vide something not for the people.

Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, today, 
the Rules Committee met and reported 
a rule, House Resolution 179, providing 
for consideration of H.R. 1, the For the 
People Act of 2021, under a structured 
rule. 
It 
self-executes 
a 
manager’s 
amendment by Chairperson LOFGREN 
and makes in order 56 amendments. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on House Administration and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 1280, the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act of 2021, under a 
closed rule. The rule provides for 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
and provides for one motion to recom-
mit. 
The rule also deems as passed H. Res. 
176, which directs the Clerk of the 
House of Representatives to make a 
correction in the engrossment of H.R. 
1319, and H. Res. 177, which authorizes 
candidates for election to the House 
and Members of the House to file state-
ments with the Clerk regarding the in-
tention to participate or not partici-
pate in the small donor financing sys-
tem for such elections created by H.R. 
1. 
Mr. Speaker, the House will be con-
sidering two pieces of critically impor-
tant legislation this week that are a 
long time coming. 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act, will 
expand voting rights, limit partisan 
gerrymandering, improve election in-
tegrity, and revise rules for political 
spending and government ethics. The 
2020 election brought out unprece-
dented turnout, even in the middle of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Thanks in 
large part to voting by mail, more than 
159 million Americans voted, the larg-
est total vote turnout in United States 
history. 
What followed was the most heavily 
scrutinized election in modern history, 
with our airwaves filled with horrific 
and dangerous lies that fundamentally 
damaged many people’s faith in our de-
mocracy. Yet, through that entire or-
deal, not a single shred of evidence of 
any systemic fraud was ever discov-
ered—none at all. 
Voting in this country, however, is 
far from perfect. Many people, particu-
larly Americans of color and those 
from low-income families, face tremen-
dous barriers to making their voices 
heard, from long lines at the polls to 
discriminatory ID laws. 
I believe, and the Democratic major-
ity believes, our national effort should 
be aimed at eliminating barriers to the 
ballot. We believe true participatory 
democracy can only be achieved when 
everyone—everyone—is 
afforded 
the 
opportunity to vote. We believe it is 
better for America that every voice be 
heard here in Washington, in State 
capitols, and in city, town, and village 
halls across our Nation. 
It is better for all of our citizens 
when each and every citizen has a 
stake in what their government says 
and what their government does. And 
we believe it is better for us on the 
world stage when our democracy shines 
as a beacon of hope and success for oth-
ers to emulate. 
It is becoming increasingly clear that 
not everyone believes our national in-
terest is served by greater voter par-
ticipation. It is held in some quarters 
that, rather than seeing greater par-
ticipation as a sign of our democracy’s 
enduring strength, it is instead seen as 
evidence of a dark, sinister plot. Or 
perhaps, more cynically, they express 
that view because suppressing votes, 
particularly of those with whom they 
disagree, will improve their chances for 
electoral success, even though it weak-
ens our democracy. 
Rather than trying to build on the 
successes of record voter turnout, 
many of my friends on the other side of 
the aisle would rather turn their backs 
on those successes and begin an orga-
nized effort to change the rules because 
they didn’t like the outcome. 
The minority has put forward a nar-
rative that suggests we must choose 
between two separate paths, accessi-
bility and security. But that is a delib-
erately false narrative. We can, and we 
must, achieve both. H.R. 1 is the vehi-
cle to advance both. 
The For the People Act places a sig-
nificant emphasis on election security, 
in everything from voter registration 
to ensuring all voting systems are se-
cure with paper ballots and robust elec-
tion result audits. 
The outrage we have heard from Re-
publican leaders in Congress dem-
onstrates how out of touch they are 
with their own voters. More than two- 
thirds of likely voters, including 57 per-
cent of Republicans, said they would 
back the proposals in H.R. 1. Ameri-
cans want more accountability from 
their leaders, not less. 
b 1930 
They want the influence of money 
out of politics. They want an end to 
gerrymandered districts. They want 
voting to be a celebration of our civil 
duty, not a constant battle to over-
come administrative hurdles. 
We owe it to those Americans to cre-
ate the ethical and accessible democ-
racy that they so richly deserve. 
The House will also take up H.R. 1280, 
the George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act. This legislation represents the 
work of hundreds of legislators and 
millions of American advocates who 
have fought for decades for a more eq-
uitable future. 
This fight is especially personal for 
me, as my own community of Roch-
ester, New York, has grappled with two 
recent tragedies that underscore just 
how necessary police reform truly is. 
Just one block from here, on the west 
pediment of the United States Supreme 
Court, is a promise to every American: 
‘‘Equal justice under law.’’ 
Sadly, we know that for too many 
Americans, that promise is an empty 
one. It was an empty promise for Dan-
iel Prude, who, while naked and un-
armed, faced a mental health crisis in 
the streets of Rochester when police 
arrived on the scene last March. He 
needed a warm blanket and treatment 
by a mental health professional. He got 
neither and died in police custody just 
days later. 
It wasn’t true just a month ago for a 
young girl in my community, who was 
forcibly restrained and pepper sprayed 
as she called out for her father. She is 
9 years old. A police officer on the 
scene, impatient with her pleas to see 
her dad, urged her to stop acting like a 
child. Her response: ‘‘I am a child.’’ 
It would be laughable if it were not 
heartbreaking. 
Equal justice under law was an 
empty 
promise 
for 
George 
Floyd, 
Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, and for 
countless others in every corner of 
America and for countless more still to 
come unless we take bold, decisive ac-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H866 
March 1, 2021 
Indeed, it is up to each of us to make 
the changes necessary to finally fulfill 
the promise of equal justice. 
The time for incremental change has 
passed. It is clear that we need a cul-
tural paradigm shift and massive re-
imagining of our public safety proto-
cols, and that starts with the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
The bill prohibits religious, racial, 
and discriminatory profiling by every 
police department in America, sup-
ported by improved training for offi-
cers and comprehensive data collection 
and tracking to ensure departments 
are following the law. 
It will save lives by banning dan-
gerous police practices, like choke 
holds and no-knock drug warrants. It 
will ensure that law enforcement uses 
deadly force only when absolutely nec-
essary and only after exhausting dees-
calation tactics. 
This legislation would limit the 
transfer of military-grade equipment 
to State and local law enforcement be-
cause peace, safety, and community 
trust cannot—cannot—be realized with 
weapons of war. 
The George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act will create desperately needed ac-
countability by expanding the use of 
body-worn 
cameras 
and 
dashboard 
cameras and eliminating the qualified 
immunity protections that allow bad 
actors in law enforcement to stay on 
the force. 
As a whole, this legislation addresses 
police 
misconduct, 
creates 
greater 
transparency, 
and 
affords 
victims 
meaningful avenues for redress. With 
these policies, we can build trust and 
we can begin to build cooperation be-
tween law enforcement and the com-
munities they are supposed to serve 
and protect. 
We passed both the For the People 
Act and the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act in the previous Congress, 
and it is my hope that this year rep-
resents a real opportunity to move 
both bills forward to the President’s 
desk so that we can build stronger de-
mocracy and justice for the American 
people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this rule and to support both un-
derlying bills, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York (Mr. MORELLE), my very good 
friend, for yielding me the customary 
30 minutes, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule covers two 
items, both of which will be familiar to 
Members who were here during the 
116th Congress. We are once again con-
sidering H.R. 1, a bill that nationalizes 
our election system and substitutes 
Washington’s judgment for a key re-
sponsibility of our States in the admin-
istration of free and fair elections. We 
are also considering H.R. 1280, the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
Unfortunately, despite its title, H.R. 
1 has nothing at all to do with the peo-
ple. It is, instead, a bill about pre-
serving the present Democrat major-
ity. It is a bill by Democrats for Demo-
crats. Though the majority claims this 
bill is about reforming our political 
system, the reality is that most of the 
changes in this bill, if enacted into law, 
would be to benefit the majority to the 
detriment of the minority. 
The most egregious of these provi-
sions are those dedicated to changing 
our national system of campaign fi-
nance. Now, in general, I think this is 
a worthy goal, but the majority’s pro-
posed solution does not make much 
sense. The majority is proposing to cre-
ate a new federally funded campaign 
ATM using corporate fines, ensuring 
that certain candidates will receive 
millions of dollars just for running a 
campaign. 
My colleagues in the majority have 
bemoaned 
the 
massive 
amount 
of 
money that has been entering into our 
campaign system over the past few dec-
ades, yet their proposed solution is to 
dump corporate dollars into the sys-
tem. 
In what world does this make sense? 
Even Democrats know what a flawed 
program this is, which is why today’s 
rule also includes a provision to allow 
Members of Congress to opt out of this 
program. Before this bill was even 
passed by the House, Democrats were 
already running from it. They should 
just keep running and pull this bill 
from the floor. 
Other proposed changes in this bill 
are just egregious. Wherever possible, 
the majority is attempting to impose 
one-size-fits-all systems from Wash-
ington onto the States. It does this 
with a one-size-fits-all voter registra-
tion system, including forcing States 
to provide same-day voter registration 
whether they want to or not. 
It takes away the power of the States 
to choose how to redistrict, forcing 
them to adopt Washington-imposed 
‘‘independent 
redirecting 
commis-
sions,’’ something that less than 20 per-
cent of the States who undertake redis-
tricting actually do. 
These provisions impede the tradi-
tional power of the States to control 
their own elections. As a former sec-
retary of state and election official in 
my home State of Oklahoma, I find 
these changes to be particularly con-
cerning. 
But what is worse, H.R. 1 also in-
cludes 
severe 
restrictions 
on 
free 
speech and repeals the Lois Lerner 
rule, a rule put into place after the IRS 
began targeting the speech of conserv-
ative 
organizations 
in 
determining 
whether or not they would qualify for 
tax exempt status. If enacted into law, 
these provisions would reweaponize the 
IRS and limit the abilities of organiza-
tions, corporations, and individuals to 
freely exercise this most-important 
right guaranteed under the Constitu-
tion. 
How the majority can claim that this 
bill is for the people when they are bla-
tantly restricting the people’s right to 
free 
speech 
is 
beyond 
my 
under-
standing. 
Mr. Speaker, what the majority is at-
tempting today is egregious. Changing 
the national campaign finance system 
to benefit themselves, taking tradi-
tional powers away from the States, 
and restricting the right of free speech 
are all part of an unprecedented power 
grab. 
I strongly urge the majority to 
change course, and I urge my col-
leagues to reject this terrible bill. 
Today, we are also considering H.R. 
1280, the George Floyd Justice in Polic-
ing Act. As with H.R. 1, this bill will be 
familiar to our returning Members, as 
the House passed an identical bill last 
summer. 
Unfortunately, while I think this bill 
is well-intentioned, it, too, is mis-
guided. Reforms contained in H.R. 1280 
will do more harm than good. I do not 
doubt the majority’s good intentions 
with this legislation. 
The George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act came about following the tragic 
events of last summer. George Floyd’s 
death demonstrated what so many 
Americans know only too well, that 
abuses of power clearly exist and must 
be grappled with. 
And while the overwhelming major-
ity of law enforcement officers faith-
fully and bravely carry out their duties 
and responsibilities each day, all too 
often many Americans receive dif-
ferent treatment due to the color of 
their skin. Americans across the coun-
try rightly condemn this horrific and 
unacceptable act. 
Unfortunately, rather than choosing 
to come together to legislate in a bi-
partisan manner, the majority chose to 
take the exact opposite course last 
summer, and we are once again consid-
ering the same flawed and deeply par-
tisan bill we considered then and that 
the Senate failed to take up. I believe 
this bill will face the same result, 
should the House pass it again this 
week. 
During the last Congress, when the 
Judiciary Committee met to mark up 
this bill, the majority completely shut 
out Republicans from the process. Re-
publicans made good-faith attempts to 
work with the Democrats to find com-
mon ground on needed reforms, yet 
every single one of these attempts were 
rejected. 
This year, the majority has not even 
deigned to bring this bill to a markup 
in the Judiciary Committee, and, once 
again, the majority has shut Repub-
licans out of the process. 
This is no way to legislate on an 
issue that is this important, Mr. 
Speaker. Republicans and Democrats 
alike agree that reforms are necessary. 
We all watched the tragedy of George 
Floyd unfold last summer and we all 
watched the resulting protests. We all 
agree that action is necessary. But 
rather than working together in the 
best interest of the American people, 
the majority is once again telling Re-
publicans that they can only have a

Hobson’s choice. They can take the 
Democrats’ bill or they can take the 
Democrats’ bill with no other options. 
But I, along with my fellow Repub-
licans, reject that idea. We fully recog-
nize the critical need for reform. My 
colleagues, both in the House and in 
the Senate, have put together our own 
package, the JUSTICE Act, filled with 
bipartisan reforms that could pass both 
the House and the Senate and be signed 
into law quickly. These reforms in-
clude critical measures, like providing 
funding for body cameras for police of-
ficers, requiring deescalation proce-
dures, and banning choke holds. 
My 
colleague, 
Representative 
STAUBER, offered this as an amendment 
at the Rules Committee earlier today, 
but, once again, the majority chose to 
shut out Republicans and refused to 
make this amendment in order. 
That is a sad state of affairs, Mr. 
Speaker, but the real losers here are 
the American people. This is an issue 
we can and should cooperate on. I urge 
my colleagues in the majority to 
rethink the path they are on. On an 
issue that is this important and this 
critical to the American people, the 
very best thing we can do is work to-
gether. And with a reduced majority, I 
think that would actually be good po-
litical advice for my friends. 
We can work on bipartisan reforms 
together and we can produce consensus 
legislation that has the buy-in of Mem-
bers on both sides. Unfortunately, the 
majority has once again chosen the op-
posite path: Partisan bills filled with 
provisions that do not reflect the best 
interest or consensus of the country. 
We can do better than that, Mr. 
Speaker. The American people deserve 
better. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this 
rule and the underlying legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just a brief comment. 
As much as it pains me, because I have 
nothing but incredible admiration and 
respect for my distinguished colleague, 
the gentleman from Oklahoma, but 
when it comes to the question of voting 
in the United States, the fact is that 
States right now are working—many of 
them overtime—to restrict ballot ac-
cess. That is why it is necessary for the 
Congress to step forward, as is given 
us, the power in the Constitution, to 
make sure that we pass laws that ful-
fill the dream of voter access for all 
Americans. 
I do also note that I think it would be 
much easier for us to believe that there 
is good faith on the other side of the 
aisle to negotiate some of these items 
and to perhaps reach compromise, but I 
find it hard to believe—and I stated 
this in the Rules Committee—given 
what happened over the last several 
months, that we would be in this posi-
tion, that there is any ability to have 
a belief in good faith. 
It is hard to imagine 60 lawsuits were 
brought against decisions made by 
States—not the Federal Government, 
but States—on the electoral college. 
Two-thirds of the members of the 
House 
Republican 
Conference—two- 
thirds—objected to the results of the 
electoral college, and, in many cases, 
States that had Republican leadership 
and Republicans serving as secretaries 
of state or as elections commissioners. 
So I would suggest that since—for 
the first time since 1800, when John 
Adams turned over the keys to the 
White House to President Jefferson and 
we observed the first peaceful transfer 
of power from one party to another, 
that since that foundational moment 
in American history over two centuries 
ago, this is the first time that people in 
this House have objected so strenu-
ously and systematically to the results 
of the free and fair election of the 
American people. 
So we are for the people. We want to 
continue to expand ballot access, and 
we want nothing more than those wish-
es of the American public to be re-
spected by their elected officials. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN), the chair of the Committee on 
House Administration. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. Our democ-
racy is in urgent need of repair. The 
American people deserve a transparent, 
inclusive, and healthy democracy, and 
H.R. 1 will get us there. 
It is transformational, a once-in-a- 
generation, pro-democracy, anticorrup-
tion reform package. It is composed of 
comprehensive policies for eliminating 
structural and legal barriers to voting, 
ending the dominance of big money in 
our campaign finance reforms, and im-
plementing real government ethics and 
accountability reforms. 
With this landmark bill, we take a 
giant leap toward ensuring our Repub-
lic is an authentic and inclusive rep-
resentative democracy, and ensuring 
the voices of everyday Americans are 
no longer drowned out by those of 
wealthy special interests. 
b 1945 
Article I, Section 4 says this: 
‘‘The times, places and manner of 
holding elections for Senators and Rep-
resentatives, shall be prescribed in 
each State by the legislature thereof; 
but the Congress may at any time by 
law make or alter such regulations.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, that is what we are 
doing here. As the gentleman has said, 
we had a huge turnout in the 2020 elec-
tion, despite efforts by some to sup-
press turnout. Now, we see legislatures 
all over the country trying to put bar-
riers in place so the American people 
will not be able to exercise their fran-
chise. That is simply wrong. We should 
look to our constitutional obligation 
to make sure that every American has 
the capacity to vote. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), my good friend, also 
a member of the Committee on Rules. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Ranking Member COLE for 
yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1, which should 
more appropriately be titled, the for 
the politicians act, is nothing more 
than a top-down Federal power grab 
that nationalizes our elections and em-
powers the Democratic party to perma-
nently hold on to their majority. 
Article I, Section 4 of the U.S. Con-
stitution gives States the primary role 
in establishing election law and in ad-
ministering elections. 
H.R. 1 upends this constitutional bal-
ance by forcing States to permanently 
expand mail-in voting, legalize ballot 
harvesting, and disregard voter ID 
laws. Even more alarming, this bill al-
lows for the first-ever Federal funding 
of campaigns, creating a 6 to 1 govern-
ment match to small-dollar donors. 
This means that for every $200 donated, 
the Federal Government would con-
tribute $1,200. Additionally, certain 
voters will be given publicly funded 
vouchers to donate to candidates of 
their choice. 
H.R. 1 also stifles free speech and em-
powers President Biden’s IRS to target 
conservative organizations and deny 
them their tax-exempt status. 
Last, but certainly not least, H.R. 1 
increases vulnerability for foreign elec-
tion interference at a time when we 
should be increasingly more vigilant 
about hostile regimes seeking to under-
mine our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule and ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 
1. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 is the most sig-
nificant democracy reform package in 
a generation. It will make it easier to 
vote—regardless of income, ability, ge-
ography, or race; ends the domination 
of big money in politics; and enacts 
tougher ethics standards to ensure that 
public officials actually work for the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I am particularly proud 
of three provisions that I helped incor-
porate into this bill: 
Bringing the Oregon vote-by-mail 
model nationwide; 
Paving the way for all States to offer 
vote-by-mail and early voting; 
And automatic voter registration for 
individuals 
interacting 
with 
State 
agencies. 
Mr. Speaker, this is personal for me. 
I started my political career as a col-
lege student, testifying before the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee on the con-
stitutional amendment to lower the 
voting age. I spent 2 years of my life 
working in Oregon on that and on the 
national campaign. Subsequently, I 
was on a national commission from the 
Ford Foundation, the National League 
of Women Voters, and the Civic League 
to deal with how we were to reform the 
election process to make it more uni-
form and easier for the American peo-
ple.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H868 
March 1, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I was proud of that 
work, but I am a little embarrassed 
that that was four decades ago and we 
are still talking about the need for 
those reforms. And as my colleagues 
have mentioned, there are people right 
now in various State legislatures that 
are actively continuing a process of 
making it hard for Americans to vote. 
This is embarrassing. This isn’t just a 
matter of what happened with civil 
rights, this has been refined as a high 
art to be able to gerrymander people 
into unrepresentative patterns that un-
dercuts the ability of politicians se-
lecting their voters, rather than people 
selecting their politicians. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been pained by 
the lies that have been made about 
mail-in voting. I am the first Member 
of the House of Representatives to be 
elected as a result of a mail-in ballot. 
We pioneered that in 1996, and we have 
continued to pioneer that effort. And it 
is secure, it is convenient, it saves 
money for local government. It allows 
people to process this in their own 
home, in their own time, in their own 
way. In an era of the pandemic, it pro-
vides health—keeping older poll work-
ers from being exposed. 
The notion that somehow this is a 
problem that justified some of the out-
rageous statements and behavior, de-
fies description. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Oregon an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
am pained with this misrepresentation 
that the President of the United States 
would 
denigrate 
mail-in 
balloting 
while he, in fact, does it. This has been 
done by Republicans and Democrats 
alike. It is secure. It is safe. And it 
helps the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge approval 
of H.R. 1 and rejection of the bogus 
claims about the problems alleged with 
mail-in ballots. It is the most secure. It 
is the most effective. And it is one that 
I think the public deserves. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY
DAVIS), my very good 
friend, and the distinguished ranking 
member of the Committee on House 
Administration. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
COLE and the Committee on Rules. It 
was a fun day up there for a few hours. 
This nearly 800-page bill that, if 
signed into law, would impact millions 
of Americans’ right to vote and to par-
ticipate in the political process, was 
introduced on January 4 of this year. 
And the first and only hearing on H.R. 
1 was held just 4 days ago, in the small-
est committee in Congress. 
Democrats on the Committee on 
House Administration also decided a 
markup of this bill wasn’t needed, de-
spite the fact that both the bill itself 
and the membership of our committee 
have changed since last Congress. This 
is especially concerning since Demo-
crats changed House floor rules this 
Congress to weaken the MTR, making 
committees the only real opportunity 
for the minority to provide an alter-
native. But now, they are not even 
doing that. They are not even holding 
a markup on this major elections bill. 
This bill was rushed. And I guarantee 
most of my colleagues supporting this 
bill have no idea how this bill would 
really impact elections or political 
speech. But I bet they do know that if 
this bill were to become law, they 
would get a lot more funds for their 
own campaigns through the public fi-
nancing provision. 
H.R. 1, the for the politicians act, in-
cludes hundreds of pages of mandates 
on States and local election adminis-
trators. At the only hearing Congress 
has held on this massive bill, the mi-
nority’s witness was the only person on 
the panel with experience in actually 
running elections. And he told this 
committee that it would be unwork-
able in States like his. 
Mr. Speaker, we should be reviewing 
the issues that we saw during the 2020 
election cycle and helping States de-
velop a better process. Simply man-
dating how States run their elections 
is not only unconstitutional, but it will 
lead to chaos and confusion for voters. 
The for the politicians act creates a 
first-ever fund to publicly finance our 
own congressional campaigns by pro-
viding corporate money, the first cor-
porate dollars allowed into individual 
Members of Congress’ campaigns since 
1907, laundered through the Federal 
Government and into Members of Con-
gress’ own campaigns. 
Provisions in this bill also attack 
free speech protections under the First 
Amendment. We did not have any hear-
ings on the impact of changing the cur-
rent bipartisan balance of the Federal 
Election Commission to a partisan 
makeup or the effect that a ‘‘speech 
czar’’ will have on people’s ability to 
participate in the political process. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is terrible. This 
bill doesn’t address the important 
issues that deserve hearings. Any bill 
to fundamentally change our elections 
or restrict our freedom of speech 
needs—at the very least—to go through 
regular order. The American people de-
serve to know what is in this bill and 
the real-life impact it will have on 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the rule and on the underlying bill, and 
I figure my time has expired since you 
have the gavel. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate my colleague from Illinois, and I 
may not agree with him very much on 
this subject. But I really disagree if he 
thinks the Committee on Rules today 
was fun. He must be a heck of a cheap 
date. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON), my good friend, and distin-
guished colleague from the Committee 
on Rules. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago, I began 
volunteering to provide election pro-
tection services to voters after I saw 
political 
operatives 
try 
to 
block 
Swarthmore College students from vot-
ing by posting signs around their cam-
pus saying that they could not legally 
vote where they attended college. That 
was a lie. But we had to get a court 
order to take the signs down. 
Fast forward almost 20 years, and 
Haverford College students and their 
neighbors had to wage a multiyear 
campaign to get local officials to put a 
polling place on campus. The existing 
polling place was 11⁄2 miles away, in an-
other district entirely, and was incon-
venient for students—most of whom 
had no cars—and the majority of resi-
dents alike. 
The college offered to provide free 
space and parking for the polling place, 
but students and neighbors were met 
with excuse after excuse. These excuses 
were textbook voter suppression tac-
tics used to box out young voters from 
making their voices heard. 
If we have learned anything from this 
past election, it is that when we make 
it more convenient for eligible voters 
to vote, they do. 
That is why I am offering an amend-
ment to H.R. 1 that requires States 
which offer early voting to make it 
available to polling places serving col-
lege campuses. It is high time we make 
our democracy, our elections, acces-
sible to the generations who will in-
herit the world that we are legislating 
about. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the rule, to support my amend-
ment, and to support final passage of 
H.R. 1. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, my friend 
and I disagree on the two pieces of leg-
islation today, but we absolutely agree 
that the Committee on Rules’ meeting 
was not fun. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
GREENE), my friend. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition today against 
H.R. 1280. This bill is nothing more 
than a get-cops-killed campaign. It 
sends one clear message: Democrats 
hate law enforcement. 
This bill does not bring justice to vic-
tims. It just takes revenge on all of the 
men and women in uniform. Mean-
while, Speaker PELOSI is surrounded by 
an army of taxpayer-funded law en-
forcement 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week. 
This bill disarms cops and opens 
them to frivolous lawsuits by lawyers 
representing criminals who got their 
feelings hurt simply because they 
broke the law and got arrested. 
Speaker PELOSI is putting police on a 
hit list to be ambushed while on the 
job keeping our streets safe. So I have 
one message for Democrats: Shame on 
you. 
Shame on you for using these men 
and women to protect your fortress

while destroying their rights and liveli-
hoods. Don’t call a cop for help if this 
is how you are going to treat them. 
You should tell them to go home. At 
least then, they won’t have to stand 
guard while you dismantle everything 
they stand for. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 2000 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN), my very good friend and 
the ranking member of the House Com-
mittee on Natural Resources. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, it 
seems like we were just here, debating 
a COVID relief bill that was not about 
COVID relief but Democrats’ special in-
terests. Now, we are debating the rule 
for the so-called For the People Act, 
but it is not for the people but against 
the people, against our freedom, and 
against our fundamental right to vote. 
H.R. 1, the Democrats’ plan to na-
tionalize elections, stack the deck in 
their favor, and pad their campaign ac-
counts 
with 
corporate 
money 
laundered through the IRS, is exactly 
what this country does not need. 
What we do need are States carrying 
out Federal elections with integrity 
and transparency, as the Constitution 
dictates. We need American voters to 
have confidence in the voting process. 
That is what my amendment was de-
signed to do. Mr. Speaker, while leav-
ing the details and specifics of elec-
tions to the States, my amendment 
would create two simple standards to 
promote integrity and transparency. 
My amendment would provide stand-
ards and best practices for postelection 
audits and would be published online 
by each State within 30 days after the 
election. My amendment would require 
States to attest to the security and ac-
curacy of their voter ID requirements 
and maintenance of voter registration 
lists. 
While H.R. 1 actually forbids voter ID 
laws, Mr. Speaker, you have to have an 
ID to buy tobacco and alcohol in this 
country. What is the problem with hav-
ing to identify who you are to vote? 
Two simple provisions to promote in-
tegrity and transparency, but my col-
leagues across the aisle must not be 
here for integrity, transparency, and 
improving voter confidence in our elec-
tions because they wouldn’t even make 
my amendment in order. 
Mr. Speaker, since we can’t have a 
debate in committee or here on the 
floor, I will file the Voter ID Act, and 
then maybe my friends can explain to 
the American people why they are op-
posed to election integrity and trans-
parency and what is wrong with having 
to verify the identification of voters. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the rule and the underlying bill. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to again just 
note, although it has been said ad nau-
seam for the last several months, that 
while we clearly respect States’ roles 
in these elections and that it is the 
States who run elections and organize 
them, we do have the power in the Con-
gress given to us in the Constitution. 
But more importantly, this year, while 
the voters in Georgia, Pennsylvania, 
and Arizona cast ballots in free and 
fair and open elections, and those were 
certified repeatedly despite an on-
slaught of lawsuits brought by the 
former President and his advocates, all 
of which were denied going all the way 
up to the Supreme Court, our col-
leagues didn’t respect those States’ 
elections even though they were cer-
tified and even though, as we all met 
on what will be one of the darkest days 
in American history on January 6 to 
accept and certify those results given 
to us by the States, my colleagues and 
friends objected to them. 
I am not sure what that says about 
their respect for State elections since 
they didn’t respect the results of those 
elections, in many cases run by Repub-
licans in their respective States. 
Mr. Speaker, I must say I find this a 
most curious discussion. If we are not 
going to abide by the results of elec-
tions, and if we are not going to trust 
those various States to submit elec-
tions unless they agree with the out-
come that we want, why we would be 
arguing so strenuously for the continu-
ation of State control and no involve-
ment by the Federal Government, de-
spite the fact that the Constitution 
clearly vests that power here in the 
Congress? 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just quickly to my 
friend from New York, I wasn’t here, 
and he wasn’t here, but our friends 
thought to challenge in this Chamber 
the election in 2001, after 2000. I was 
here in 2004 when they challenged a 
State and demanded a recount. Then, I 
was here in 2017 when my friends on the 
other side sought to challenge 10 dif-
ferent States. So, let’s not act like this 
is somehow unusual. 
Mr. Speaker, another part of today’s 
rule includes a provision to deem 
passed a correction to last week’s 
budget reconciliation measure. Given 
that the majority now wishes to reopen 
last week’s reconciliation, it is cer-
tainly appropriate to further amend 
that resolution to correct one of the 
more egregious provisions in it. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
immediately adopt H. Res. 178, an en-
grossment correction to strike funding 
in the budget reconciliation bill for the 
Pelosi subway tunnel in California and 
instead direct the $140 million to sup-
port mental health and suicide preven-
tion in States where children do not 
have the option of in-person instruc-
tion in school. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. 
BICE), my good friend, for further ex-
planation of the amendment. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
if we defeat the previous question 
today, we will call up a resolution that 
I introduced, H. Res. 178, which would 
instruct the House Clerk to modify the 
text of H.R. 1319, the American Rescue 
Plan Act, to direct $140 million from 
Speaker PELOSI’s pork subway project 
and to instead put those funds toward 
critical mental health services for the 
Nation’s children who have continued 
to 
suffer 
in 
isolation 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
My resolution would ensure that 
mental health and suicide prevention 
services are provided in States where 
children do not have the option of in- 
person instruction in school, as isola-
tion has been a major driver of mental 
health impacts on our Nation’s kids. 
Mr. Speaker, children across this Na-
tion have been disproportionately af-
fected by the mental health impacts of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. A study by the 
National Institutes of Health found 
that social isolation has had a signifi-
cant impact on America’s children. So-
cial isolation during quarantine has 
caused many to develop feelings of sad-
ness, anxiety, and loneliness. 
Unfortunately, a study by the Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics found that 
there has been an increase in suicides 
among children following the imposi-
tion of stay-at-home orders last year. 
Another study by the Virginia Pedi-
atrics Association found a 90 percent 
rise in cases among children involving 
depression, 
anxiety, 
and 
academic 
struggles. 
Mr. Speaker, there is hope. The CDC 
recently released new guidelines that 
recommend students return to in-per-
son instruction where it can be done 
safely. Dr. Anthony Fauci himself has 
backed these new guidelines and has 
spoken in support of getting our Na-
tion’s kids back in school. 
The feelings of social isolation felt 
by so many children today can be 
quickly alleviated by reopening our 
schools. In areas of the country where 
reopenings are not happening, my reso-
lution would provide $140 million to 
bolster mental healthcare for these af-
fected children. I think we can all 
agree that the mental health impacts 
on our children should be swiftly ad-
dressed on a bipartisan basis. 
Mr. Speaker, let me state again that 
America’s children deserve the very 
best. Let’s defeat the previous question 
today so that we can provide needed re-
lief and critical mental health services

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H870 
March 1, 2021 
to children who are suffering across the 
Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote to defeat the previous question. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as I indicated when I 
began my comments this evening, I 
have nothing but the greatest admira-
tion and respect for the distinguished 
ranking member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
I don’t want to be argumentative, 
but I would note that I think there is 
a significant and substantial difference 
between a symbolic objection made by 
one or two Members to the electoral 
college results of a single State versus 
the objection of 140 Members of this 
House, particularly as it follows a vio-
lent, unprecedented attack on what I 
consider the sacred cathedral of democ-
racy, the United States Capitol. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, obviously, I oppose the 
rule. The majority is proposing two 
significant pieces of legislation today 
that are, unfortunately, both deeply 
partisan. In neither case has the major-
ity allowed Republicans to be involved 
in the process of legislating. 
Mr. Speaker, on H.R. 1, the majority 
is proposing a deeply troubling take-
over of election practices that will ben-
efit only Democrats. The bill will take 
away the traditional powers of the 
States to run their own elections as 
they see fit, imposing a one-size-fits-all 
regime from Washington. 
It dumps huge amounts of corporate 
money into the campaign finance sys-
tem, particularly benefiting certain 
candidates. It imposes severe restric-
tions on free speech that are anathema 
to a free and fair election. 
On H.R. 1280, the majority is once 
again seeking to pass the same flawed 
police reform bill it passed last Con-
gress. 
Mr. Speaker, we had a real oppor-
tunity here for both Democrats and Re-
publicans to work together to pass real 
reforms for the American people. In-
stead of taking ‘‘yes’’ for an answer, 
the majority is instead seeking to im-
pose a deeply partisan bill that will not 
fix the problems or help heal the Amer-
ican people. 
Mr. Speaker, we deserve better than 
that. The American people are best 
served when their Representatives in 
Congress can come together and work 
in a bipartisan manner. One side at-
tempting to impose partisan legisla-
tion on the country does us all a dis-
service. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
rethink this path, reject both of these 
bills, and return to the negotiating 
table and work with Republicans for a 
brighter future for all Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I mean this with all sin-
cerity. There is a great gap between us 
on H.R. 1. We just simply look at this 
matter differently. I think it is egre-
gious partisan overreach. On H.R. 1280, 
there really is an opportunity for bi-
partisan cooperation. The JUSTICE 
Act that Mr. STAUBER filed last year 
and presented today as an amendment 
has a great deal in common with some 
of the objectives I know my friends 
want to achieve on their side of the 
aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, in an almost evenly di-
vided House and an evenly divided Sen-
ate that still has the filibuster, you 
can’t do things by reconciliation every 
day. Most days, to get much done, it is 
going to require bipartisan coopera-
tion. 
We often say that never happens. The 
reality is it happens a lot more than 
people acknowledge. Five times last 
year we came together as Republicans 
and Democrats and passed COVID relief 
packages that made a big difference in 
this country. We also passed the spend-
ing bill on a bipartisan basis that fund-
ed the government for this entire fiscal 
year. We did that in the middle of a 
Presidential election year that was ex-
traordinarily divisive. 
Mr. Speaker, we can work together. I 
would ask my friends to rethink the 
course of the reconciliation bill and 
now these two pieces of legislation and 
start thinking about where we can ac-
tually get things done. I think the 
George Floyd bill, H.R. 1280, is one of 
those places. I also think the appro-
priations process can be one of those 
places. We can probably even find some 
common ground on some of the elec-
toral issues, although personally, in 
my view, H.R. 1 is a very flawed piece 
of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend from New York for the debate 
and tell him that, despite our disagree-
ments on these two pieces of legisla-
tion, I look forward to working with 
him. I don’t think either of these are 
likely to get through the United States 
Senate. I do think we can get a product 
back from the United States Senate 
that both of us might be able to vote 
for, in terms of police justice and over-
haul. We will wait and see what hap-
pens with H.R. 1. I am less optimistic 
we will ever see it again, but I am 
happy to say good-bye to it out of this 
Chamber. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of the 
rule and I urge rejection of both under-
lying pieces of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much, 
as always, the thoughtful comments by 
my colleague and friend, the distin-
guished 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE). 
Mr. Speaker, as it relates to the 
question of matters before us here, we 
do have significant differences in how 
we view access to the ballot. 
I would note that, historically, par-
ties change. They evolve. Typically, 
because this is in keeping with Amer-
ican democracy, we evolve to reflect 
the needs and concerns and wishes and 
results of American elections and their 
expression of the will of the people of 
this country. 
Mr. Speaker, what I find troubling 
right now is that friends across the 
aisle seem to be focused not so much 
on learning the lessons given to us by 
those voters, by the American public, 
as expressed in the first Tuesday after 
the first Monday in November. 
But instead, conscientious, by-design 
work to limit those who would want 
access to the ballot so that they can 
choose the voters, as opposed to the 
other 
way 
around—disenfranchising 
those, and setting up barriers, as we 
see happening in State capitals across 
the country, is troubling indeed. And, I 
think, it demonstrates the clear divi-
sion between the two parties on this 
particular issue. 
b 2015 
We seek, and we will always seek, to 
expand access to make sure that every 
single American, every single citizen 
who wants to participate in our democ-
racy has the right, because that is how 
we end up with a better America, and 
we fulfill the promise of moving toward 
a more perfect Union. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my col-
leagues for their words in support of 
the rule before us today. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on the rule and a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 179 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 7. House Resolution 178 is hereby 
adopted. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

UNVEILING OF COLUMBIA, SOUTH 
CAROLINA, MONUMENT 
(Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, to-
morrow, at noon, the city of Columbia, 
South Carolina, Historic Columbia, and 
the University of South Carolina will 
unveil a monument that will mark the 
60th anniversary of the landmark case 
Edwards v. South Carolina. 
That case resulted from the protest 
march of almost 200 college and high 
school students from across South 
Carolina who came to Columbia to pro-
test segregation, discrimination, and 
what amounted to apartheid. 
Madam Speaker, 192 or 193 of us were 
arrested on that day, and 189 were con-
victed. Two years later, the Supreme 
Court of the United States overturned 
those convictions in this historic and 
landmark case against South Carolina, 
which rendered an end to any State 
passing laws to subject protest march-
ers to anything but what they were. 
Madam Speaker, tomorrow, I will 
submit a full statement, thanking 
those for doing so.

CELEBRATING 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF MOSES LAKE BAPTIST CHURCH 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise to celebrate the 10th anni-
versary of Moses Lake Baptist Church 
and to sincerely thank them for their 
contributions to the Moses Lake com-
munity. 
Madam Speaker, central Washing-
tonians are people of deep and sincere 
faith. We know firsthand that churches 
and faith-based organizations like the 
Moses Lake Baptist Church are funda-
mental to the well-being and very fiber 
of our local communities. 
From performing acts of service, to 
ensuring the spiritual and emotional 
health of their congregants, particu-
larly during the challenging times of 
the past year, Moses Lake Baptist 
Church goes above and beyond to de-
liver the Word of God to individuals

and families throughout central Wash-
ington. 
Madam Speaker, I have personally 
experienced the kindness and prayers 
of the leadership, including Pastor 
Dennis Fountain and the congregation 
at the church. I know firsthand how 
they 
spread 
the 
message 
of 
love 
through God’s teachings. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate 10 
years of faithful service, I extend my 
congratulations to Moses Lake Baptist 
Church and wish them many more dec-
ades of blessing our community. 
f 
SUPPORT COVID–19 HOSPITAL 
LOAN CONVERSION 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to support and ask my colleagues to 
support the COVID–19 Hospital Loan 
Conversion Act, a bipartisan piece of 
legislation that I have introduced 
along with my good friend from Ohio 
(Mr. GIBBS). 
Madam Speaker, our Nation’s hos-
pitals have invested heavily to prepare 
for 
and 
care 
for 
us 
during 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. They canceled 
tens of thousands of elective surgeries 
and nonemergency patient tests, at the 
government’s request, to help ensure 
adequate hospital capacity, preserve 
gear and equipment, and reduce the 
risk of unnecessary patient spread. 
Madam Speaker, this major shift has 
put some of America’s hospitals on the 
brink of financial disaster. While a pro-
vider grant program that costs $175 bil-
lion and is designed to provide support 
to all providers is helpful, more sup-
port is needed, especially in regions 
that fall well below the median house-
hold income at the national average. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation will 
convert Medicare accelerated and ad-
vance payment loans to grants to en-
sure the additional financial support 
hospitals and other providers direly 
need. 
Hospitals across my district have 
shared that in the absence of more fi-
nancial support, including this assist-
ance, it is possible they will be forced 
to close their significantly scaled back 
operations. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support the bill, the Gibbs-Kaptur, 
Kaptur-Gibbs bill, to help these hos-
pitals out.

RECOGNIZING JUSTICE GIORDANO 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize 
Miss 
Justice 
Giordano 
from 
Cambria County, Pennsylvania. 
Justice, a 17-year-old junior at Por-
tage Area High School, has been se-
lected by the Pennsylvania Chapter of 
Students Against Destructive Deci-
sions to serve as an ambassador for the 
upcoming year. 
Students Against Destructive Deci-
sions, often referred to as SADD, is the 
Nation’s premier youth health and 
safety organization. The organization’s 
mission is to empower young people to 
successfully confront the risks and 
pressures that challenge them through-
out their daily lives. Justice will play 
an integral role in achieving that mis-
sion and raising awareness across the 
Commonwealth. Most recently, Justice 
has shifted her focus to the dangers of 
vaping and electronic cigarettes. 
Justice’s school principal had noth-
ing but great things to say about her. 
He said, ‘‘Justice is a leader among her 
peers, and she strives to make positive 
decisions while making those around 
her better. We are very proud of Jus-
tice here at Portage Area.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I am confident Jus-
tice’s positive attitude and dedication 
to helping fellow students will help her 
excel in this exciting new role. 
Congratulations, Justice. 
f 
THE TRAGIC DEATH OF GEORGE 
FLOYD HAS AWAKENED THE NA-
TION 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
with great expectation, we expect to 
have the George Floyd Justice in Polic-
ing Act on the floor of the House this 
week. 
I am joined in these special 1-minute 
speeches by Congressman BOWMAN from 
New York and Congresswoman LEE 
from California. On behalf of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, we are here to 
say that the tragic death of George 
Floyd has awakened the Nation and 
the world to the gross injustice that 
too many African Americans face on a 
daily basis. 
Eight minutes and 46 seconds, and 
the world stood up. New Zealand and 
London, around the world, they all 
said, enough is enough. 
This legislation will now have quali-
fied immunity reform, pattern and 
practice investigations, the idea of a 
national police misconduct registry, 
the Law Enforcement Trust and Integ-
rity Act banning choke holds, banning 
no-knock drug warrants. 
It will be a new day in the relation-
ship between police and community. 
Crisis units because police do not want 
to be social workers. We know there 
are officers who believe in protect and 
serve. At the same time, we know the 
Nation does not want police mis-
conduct. 
Let’s work together, pass this legis-
lation, and let it be signed by the 
President of the United States. I thank 
the Congressional Black Caucus for its 
leadership. The world is watching us 
this week. 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
AMBASSADOR DAVID M. FRIED-
MAN 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to give thanks for the service of 
David M. Friedman, recently our Am-
bassador from the United States to 
Israel. 
As 
Ambassador, 
Mr. 
Friedman 
strengthened our bond with Israel, 
took our partnership to new heights, 
secured 
peaceful 
relationships 
for 
Israel in the Middle East, and was in-
fluential in moving the U.S. Embassy 
to Jerusalem. 
Through his diligent work, Mr. Fried-
man set in motion the peaceful resolu-
tion of Israel-Arab conflicts. His hard 
work and service set the standard for 
building U.S. diplomatic relationships, 
and earned him a well-deserved nomi-
nation for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
I would like to thank Ambassador 
Friedman for his service, and wish him 
success in his future endeavors. 
f 
TRANSFORMING 
POLICE 
AND 
HOLDING BAD ACTORS ACCOUNT-
ABLE 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, tonight, I stand with my Con-
gressional 
Black 
Caucus 
members, 
Congresswoman SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE 
and Congressman JAMAAL BOWMAN, to 
call attention to the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act, which recognizes 
that, in order to transform policing, we 
must hold bad actors accountable while 
working to prevent instances of bru-
tality and misconduct. 
As a mother and a grandmother of 
Black men and boys, these issues are 
really personal to me and my family 
and countless other families who face 
excessive force from law enforcement 
each and every day. This bill will ad-
dress racial profiling, create a use-of- 
force database, improve transparency 
with a national police misconduct 
database, ban no-knock warrants and 
choke holds, end qualified immunity— 
nobody is above the law—and will limit 
the transfer of military-grade equip-
ment to State and local law enforce-
ment. 
We stand with the American people 
to turn this moment of agony into one 
of action, as we honor Mr. George 
Floyd’s life and the lives of all those 
killed by police brutality. We will con-
tinue working with the millions of 
Americans marching and demanding 
action, and we will not stop until this 
legislation becomes law. 
As an original cosponsor of this bill, 
I urge us to take this opportunity to 
honor the lives of all police misconduct 
victims by preventing future cases 
from occurring.

HONORING THE AMERICAN RED 
CROSS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
American Red Cross for celebrating 140 
years of service. 
Since their founding by Clara Barton 
in 1881, the American Red Cross has 
been paramount in preventing and alle-
viating human suffering in the face of 
emergencies. 
As an organization, they aspire to 
turn compassion into action so that 
countless individuals affected by dis-
aster receive care, shelter, and hope. 
They are part of the world’s largest 
volunteer network found in nearly 200 
countries. The American Red Cross de-
veloped the first nationwide civilian 
blood program in the 1940s, and they 
still provide more than 40 percent of 
the blood products in this country. 
As we continue to navigate this 
health crisis, they remain steadfast in 
their commitment to delivering much- 
needed services to communities across 
the Nation. I am extremely grateful for 
the work the American Red Cross has 
done to uplift those in need. 
f 
A LIFETIME OF DEALING WITH 
POLICE BRUTALITY AND POLICE 
MISCONDUCT 
(Mr. BOWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
proudly in support of the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act, along with my 
colleagues, 
Congresswoman 
JACKSON 
LEE and Congresswoman BARBARA LEE. 
Unfortunately, I have had a lifetime 
of dealing with police brutality and po-
lice misconduct. It first happened when 
I was 11 years old. I was simply horse-
playing with some of my friends in my 
neighborhood 
when 
the 
police 
ap-
proached us and asked us to keep it 
down. Because we had the audacity to 
ask a follow-up question, I was grabbed 
on my arm, I was thrown against the 
wall, and I was thrown to the ground, 
handcuffed, and night-sticked in the 
back. 
Unfortunately, this was the first 
time, but not the last time. I have been 
taken out of my car and handcuffed, 
taken to jail and released without see-
ing a judge. Unfortunately, this is the 
norm for too many African Americans 
and too many poor people across this 
country. 
So I ask my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to support the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act so that 
we can finally have justice and, most 
importantly, accountability across this 
country. Those who serve us in law en-
forcement are not above the law.

(b) The majority party members of the 
Committee may provide for such temporary, 
ad hoc subcommittees as determined to be 
appropriate. 
RULE 4. EX OFFICIO MEMBERSHIP 
The Chair of the Committee and the rank-
ing minority party member (‘‘Ranking Mem-
ber’’) shall be ex officio members, but not 
voting members, of each subcommittee to 
which such Chair or Ranking Member has 
not been assigned, and as ex officio members 
they shall not be counted for the purpose of 
constituting a quorum. 
RULE 5. SUBCOMMITTEE SCHEDULING 
(a) Subcommittee chair shall set meeting 
or hearing dates after consultation with the 
Chair and other subcommittee chair with a 
view toward avoiding simultaneous sched-
uling of Committee and subcommittee meet-
ings or hearings, wherever possible. No such 
meetings or hearings, however, shall be held 
outside of Washington, D.C. without the 
prior authorization of the Committee Chair. 
Where practicable, 14 days’ notice will be 
given of such meeting or hearing. 
(b) Available dates for subcommittee meet-
ings shall be assigned by the Chair to the 
subcommittees as nearly as practicable in 
rotation and in accordance with their work-
loads. As far as practicable, the Chair shall 
not schedule simultaneous subcommittee 
markups, a subcommittee markup during a 
full Committee markup, or any hearing dur-
ing a markup. 
RULE 6. SUBCOMMITTEE RULES 
The rules of the Committee shall be the 
rules of its subcommittees. 
RULE 7. SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT OF MEMBERS 
To facilitate the oversight and other legis-
lative and investigative activities of the 
Committee, the Chair of the Committee 
may, at the request of a subcommittee chair, 
make a temporary assignment of any mem-
ber of the Committee to such subcommittee 
for the purpose of constituting a quorum and 
of enabling such member to participate in 
any public hearing, investigation, or study 
by such subcommittee to be held outside of 
Washington, D.C. Any member of the Com-
mittee may attend public hearings of any 
subcommittee and any member of the Com-
mittee may question witnesses only when 
they have been recognized by the Chair for 
that purpose. 
RULE 8. HEARING PROCEDURE 
(a) The Chair, in the case of hearings to be 
conducted by the Committee, and the appro-
priate subcommittee chair, in the case of 
hearings to be conducted by a subcommittee, 
shall make public announcement of the date, 
place, and subject matter of any hearing to 
be conducted on any measure or matter at 
least one week before the commencement of 
that hearing unless the Chair of the Com-
mittee, with the concurrence of the Ranking 
Member, determines that there is good cause 
to begin such hearing at an earlier date or 
the Committee so determines by majority 
vote in the presence of the number of mem-
bers required under the rules of the Com-
mittee for the transaction of business. In the 
latter event, the Chair or the subcommittee 
chair, as the case may be, shall have such an 
announcement promptly published in the 
Daily Digest and made publicly available in 
electronic form. To the extent practicable, 
the Chair or the subcommittee chair shall 
make public announcement of the final list 
of witnesses scheduled to testify at least 48 
hours before the commencement of the hear-
ing. The staff director of the Committee 
shall promptly notify the Daily Digest Clerk 
of the Congressional Record as soon as prac-
ticable after such public announcement is 
made. 
(b) Subcommittees are authorized to hold 
hearings, receive exhibits, hear witnesses, 
and report to the Committee for final action, 
together with such recommendations as may 
be agreed upon by the subcommittee. 
(c) All opening statements at hearings con-
ducted by the Committee or any sub-
committee will be made part of the perma-
nent written record. Opening statements by 
members may not be presented orally, unless 
the Chair of the Committee or any sub-
committee determines that one statement 
from the Chair or a designee will be pre-
sented, in which case the Ranking Member 
or a designee may also make a statement. If 
a witness scheduled to testify at any hearing 
of the Committee or any subcommittee is a 
constituent of a member of the Committee 
or subcommittee, such member shall be enti-
tled to briefly introduce such witness at the 
hearing. 
(d) To the extent practicable, witnesses 
who are to appear before the Committee or a 
subcommittee shall file with the staff direc-
tor of the Committee, at least 48 hours in ad-
vance of their appearance, a written state-
ment of their proposed testimony, together 
with a brief summary thereof, and shall 
limit their oral presentation to a summary 
thereof. The staff director of the Committee 
shall promptly furnish to the staff director 
of the minority a copy of such testimony 
submitted to the Committee pursuant to this 
rule. The Chair of the Committee, or a mem-
ber designated by the Chair, may administer 
oaths to witnesses. 
(e) When any hearing is conducted by the 
Committee or any subcommittee upon any 
measure or matter, the minority party mem-
bers on the Committee shall be entitled, 
upon request to the Chair by a majority of 
those minority party members before the 
completion of such hearing, to call witnesses 
selected by the minority to testify with re-
spect to that measure or matter during at 
least one day of hearing thereon. The minor-
ity party may waive this right by calling at 
least one witness during a Committee hear-
ing or subcommittee hearing. 
(f) In the conduct of hearings of sub-
committees sitting jointly, the rules other-
wise applicable to all subcommittees shall 
likewise apply to joint subcommittee hear-
ings for purposes of such shared consider-
ation. 
RULE 9. QUESTIONING OF HEARING WITNESSES 
(a) Subject to clauses (b), (c), and (d), a 
Committee member may question hearing 
witnesses only when the member has been 
recognized by the Chair for that purpose, and 
only for a five-minute period until all mem-
bers present have had an opportunity to 
question a witness. The questioning of wit-
nesses in both Committee and subcommittee 
hearings shall be initiated by the Chair, fol-
lowed by the Ranking Member and all other 
members alternating between the majority 
and minority party. The Chair shall exercise 
discretion in determining the order in which 
members will be recognized. In recognizing 
members to question witnesses in this fash-
ion, the Chair shall take into consideration 
the ratio of the majority to minority party 
members present and shall establish the 
order of recognition for questioning in such 
a manner as not to place the members of the 
majority party in a disadvantageous posi-
tion. 
(b) The Chair may permit a specified num-
ber of members to question a witness for 
longer than five minutes. The time for ex-
tended questioning of a witness under this 
clause shall be equal for the majority party 
and the minority party and may not exceed 
one hour in the aggregate. 
(c) The Chair may permit Committee staff 
for the majority and the minority party 
members to question a witness for equal 
specified periods. The time for extended 
questioning of a witness under this clause 
shall be equal for the majority party and the 
minority party and may not exceed one hour 
in the aggregate. 
(d) In an investigative hearing or in an ex-
ecutive session, the Chair’s authority to ex-
tend questioning under subsection (b) and (c) 
of this rule shall be equal for the majority 
and the minority party and may not exceed 
one hour in the aggregate, and shall only be 
conducted by counsel for the majority and 
the minority party when authorized under 
subsection (c) of this rule. 
RULE 10. SUBPOENA AUTHORITY 
The power to authorize and issue sub-
poenas is delegated to the Chair of the full 
Committee, as provided for under clause 
2(m)(3)(A)(i) of Rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives. The Chair shall 
notify the Ranking Member prior to issuing 
any subpoena under such authority. To the 
extent practicable, the Chair shall consult 
with the Ranking Member at least 24 hours 
in advance of a subpoena being issued under 
such authority, excluding Saturdays, Sun-
days, and federal holidays. As soon as prac-
ticable after issuing any subpoena under 
such authority, the Chair shall notify in 
writing all members of the Committee of the 
issuance of the subpoena. 
RULE 11. DEPOSITION PROCEDURE 
(a) In accordance with Section 3 of H. Res. 
8, regarding deposition authority in the 
House of Representatives, the Chair, upon 
consultation with the Ranking Member, may 
order the taking of depositions pursuant to 
notice or subpoena as contemplated by this 
rule. 
(b) The Chair or majority staff shall con-
sult with the Ranking Member or minority 
staff no less than three business days before 
any notice or subpoena for a deposition is 
issued. After such consultation, all members 
shall receive written notice that a notice or 
subpoena for a deposition will be issued. 
(c) A notice or subpoena issued under this 
rule shall specify the date, time, and place of 
the deposition and the method or methods by 
which the deposition will be recorded. Prior 
to testifying, a deponent shall be provided 
with a copy of the Committee’s rules and the 
Rules of the House of Representatives. 
(d) 
(1) A deposition shall be conducted by one 
or more members or Committee counsel as 
designated by the Chair or Ranking Member.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H876 
March 1, 2021 
(2) A deposition shall be taken under oath 
or affirmation administered by a member or 
a person otherwise authorized to administer 
oaths and affirmations. 
(e) A deponent may be accompanied at a 
deposition by counsel to advise the deponent 
of the deponent’s rights. Only members and 
Committee counsel, however, may examine 
the deponent. No one may be present at a 
deposition other than members, Committee 
staff designated by the Chair or Ranking 
Member, such individuals as may be required 
to administer the oath or affirmation and 
transcribe or record the proceedings, the de-
ponent, and the deponent’s counsel (includ-
ing personal counsel and counsel for the en-
tity employing the deponent if the scope of 
the deposition is expected to cover actions 
taken as part of the deponent’s employ-
ment). Observers or counsel for other persons 
or entities may not attend. 
(f) 
(1) Unless the majority, minority, and de-
ponent agree otherwise, questions in a depo-
sition shall be propounded in rounds, alter-
nating between the majority and minority. A 
single round shall not exceed 60 minutes per 
side, unless the members or counsel con-
ducting the deposition agree to a different 
length of questioning. In each round, a mem-
ber or Committee counsel designated by the 
Chair shall ask questions first, and the mem-
ber or Committee counsel designated by the 
Ranking Member shall ask questions second. 
(2) Any objection made during a deposition 
must be stated concisely and in a non-
argumentative and non-suggestive manner. 
Deponent may refuse to answer a question 
only to preserve a privilege. When the depo-
nent has objected and refused to answer a 
question to preserve a privilege, the Chair 
may rule on any such objection after the 
deposition has adjourned. If the Chair over-
rules any such objection and thereby orders 
a deponent to answer any question to which 
a privilege objection was lodged, such ruling 
shall be filed with the clerk of the Com-
mittee and shall be provided to members and 
the deponent no less than three days before 
the ruling is enforced at a reconvened deposi-
tion. If a member of the Committee appeals 
in writing the ruling of the Chair, the appeal 
shall be preserved for Committee consider-
ation. A deponent who refuses to answer a 
question after being directed to answer by 
the Chair in writing may be subject to sanc-
tion, except that no sanctions may be im-
posed if the ruling of the Chair is reversed on 
appeal. In all cases, when deposition testi-
mony for which an objection has been made 
is offered for admission in evidence before 
the Committee, all properly lodged objec-
tions then made shall be timely and shall be 
considered by the Committee prior to admis-
sion in evidence before the Committee. 
(g) Deposition testimony shall be tran-
scribed by stenographic means and may also 
be video recorded. The clerk of the Com-
mittee shall receive the transcript and any 
video recording and promptly forward such 
to minority staff at the same time the clerk 
distributes such to other majority staff. 
(h) The individual administering the oath 
shall certify on the transcript that the depo-
nent was duly sworn. The transcriber shall 
certify that the transcript is a true, ver-
batim record of the testimony, and the tran-
script and any exhibits shall be filed, as shall 
any video recording, with the clerk of the 
Committee. In no case shall any video re-
cording be considered the official transcript 
of a deposition or otherwise supersede the 
certified written transcript. 
(i) After receiving the transcript, majority 
staff shall make available the transcript for 
review by the deponent or deponent’s coun-
sel. No later than ten business days there-
after, the deponent may submit suggested 
changes to the Chair. Committee majority 
staff may direct the clerk of the Committee 
to note any typographical errors, including 
any requested by the deponent or minority 
staff, via an errata sheet appended to the 
transcript. 
Any 
proposed 
substantive 
changes, modifications, clarifications, or 
amendments to the deposition testimony 
must be submitted by the deponent as an af-
fidavit that includes the deponent’s reasons 
therefore. Any substantive changes, modi-
fications, 
clarifications, 
or 
amendments 
shall be included as an appendix to the tran-
script, a copy of which shall be promptly for-
warded to minority staff. 
(j) The Chair and Ranking Member shall 
consult regarding the release of deposition 
transcript or electronic recordings. If either 
objects in writing to a proposed release of a 
deposition transcript or electronic recording 
or a portion thereof, the matter shall be 
promptly referred to the Committee for reso-
lution. 
RULE 12. QUORUMS 
One-third of the members of the Com-
mittee or subcommittee shall constitute a 
quorum for taking any action other than 
amending Committee rules, closing a meet-
ing from the public, reporting a measure or 
recommendation, or in the case of the Com-
mittee or a subcommittee authorizing a sub-
poena. For the enumerated actions, a major-
ity of the Committee or subcommittee shall 
constitute a quorum. Any two members shall 
constitute a quorum for the purpose of tak-
ing testimony and receiving evidence. 
RULE 13. REFERRAL OF BILLS, RESOLUTIONS, 
AND OTHER MATTERS 
(a) The Chair shall consult with sub-
committee chair regarding referral to the 
appropriate subcommittees of such bills, res-
olutions, and other matters that have been 
referred to the Committee. Once copies of a 
bill, resolution, or other matter are avail-
able to the Committee, the Chair shall, with-
in three weeks of such availability, provide 
notice of referral, if any, to the appropriate 
subcommittee. 
(b) Referral to a subcommittee shall not be 
made until three days have elapsed after 
written notification of such proposed referral 
to all subcommittee chair, at which time 
such proposed referral shall be made unless 
one or more subcommittee chair shall have 
given written notice to the Chair of the full 
Committee and to the chair of each sub-
committee that he or she intends to question 
such proposed referral at the next regularly 
scheduled meeting of the Committee, or at a 
special meeting of the Committee called for 
that purpose, at which time referral shall be 
made by the majority members of the Com-
mittee. All bills shall be referred under this 
rule to the subcommittee of proper jurisdic-
tion without regard to whether the author is 
or is not a member of the subcommittee. 
Upon a majority vote of the Committee, a 
bill, resolution, or other matter referred to a 
subcommittee in accordance with this rule 
may be recalled at any time for the Commit-
tee’s direct consideration or for reference to 
another subcommittee. 
(c) The Chair shall announce the date, 
place, and subject matter of a Committee 
meeting, which may not commence earlier 
than the third calendar day (excluding Sat-
urdays, Sundays, or legal holidays except 
when the House is in session on such a day) 
on which members have notice thereof; but 
this requirement may be waived if the Chair 
of the Committee, with the concurrence of 
the Ranking Member, determines that there 
is good cause or the Committee so deter-
mines by majority vote in the presence of 
the number of members required under the 
rules of the Committee for the transaction of 
such business. 
(d) When a bill or resolution is being con-
sidered 
by 
the 
Committee 
or 
a 
sub-
committee, members shall provide the clerk 
in a timely manner a sufficient number of 
written copies of any amendment offered, so 
as to enable each member present to receive 
a copy thereof prior to taking action. How-
ever, if directed by the Chair or majority 
staff, an electronic submission to the clerk 
in a timely manner, in the manner pre-
scribed by the Chair or majority staff, shall 
satisfy the requirement to provide the clerk 
in a timely manner a sufficient number of 
written copies of any amendment offered. A 
point of order may be made against any 
amendment not reduced to writing. A copy 
of each such amendment shall be maintained 
in the public records of the Committee or 
subcommittee, as the case may be. 
(e) In determining the order in which 
amendments to a matter pending before the 
Committee or a subcommittee will be con-
sidered, the Chair may give priority to: 
(1) The Chair’s mark, and 
(2) Amendments, otherwise in order, that 
have been filed with the Committee at least 
24 hours prior to the Committee or sub-
committee business meeting on said measure 
or matter. 
(f) The Chair shall provide, in a timely 
manner, electronically or in paper form to 
the Ranking Member a copy of each report 
received by the Chair that is authorized by 
statute to be transmitted to Congress and 
addressed by clause 2(b) of Rule II of the 
Rules of the House of Representative, unless 
such report has been specifically marked as 
already having been sent to the Ranking 
Member or Minority Committee staff. 
(g) The Chair or majority staff shall con-
sult with the Ranking Member or minority 
staff before waiving Committee consider-
ation of a bill referred to the Committee. 
The Chair shall provide to the Ranking 
Member a copy of any Committee letter ex-
changed with another committee waiving 
Committee consideration of a bill referred to 
the Committee within 24 hours of issuing 
such a letter. 
RULE 14. VOTES 
(a) With respect to each roll call vote on a 
motion to report any bill, resolution, or mat-
ter of a public character, and on any amend-
ment offered thereto, the total number of 
votes cast for and against, and the names of 
those members voting for and against, shall 
be included in the Committee report on the 
measure or matter. 
(b) In accordance with clause 2(h)(4) of 
Rule XI of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Chair of the Committee or 
a subcommittee is authorized to postpone 
further proceedings when a record vote is or-
dered on the question of approving a measure 
or matter or on adopting an amendment. 
Such Chair may resume proceedings on a 
postponed request at any time after reason-
able notice. When proceedings resume on a 
postponed question, notwithstanding any in-
tervening order for the previous question, an 
underlying proposition shall remain subject 
to further debate or amendment to the same 
extent as when the question was postponed. 
RULE 15. RECORDS AND ROLLCALLS 
(a) Written records shall be kept of the 
proceedings of the Committee and of each 
subcommittee, including a record of the 
votes on any question on which a roll call is 
demanded. The result of each such roll call 
vote shall be made available by the Com-
mittee or subcommittee for inspection by 
the public at reasonable times and shall be 
made available on the Committee’s website 
within 48 hours of such record vote. Informa-
tion so available for public inspection and on 
the Committee’s website shall include a de-
scription of the amendment, motion, order,

any subcommittee) shall be made available 
for public use if such record has been in ex-

(1) any record that the Committee (or a 
subcommittee) makes available for public

preceding provisions of this rule. 
(2) Such 36–hour period shall not conclude

notice of intention to file supplemental, mi-
nority, or additional views for inclusion as 
part of the printed report. 
(3) To the extent practicable, any report 
prepared pursuant to a Committee or sub-

prior to consideration of any such report by 
the Committee or subcommittee, as the case

(b) Disclaimers. 
(1) A report on activities of the Committee 
required under clause 1(d) of Rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives shall 
include the following disclaimer in the docu-
ment transmitting the report to the Clerk of 
the House of Representatives: 
This report has not been officially adopted 
by the Committee on Education and Labor 
or any subcommittee thereof and therefore 
may not necessarily reflect the views of its 
members. 
Such disclaimer need not be included if the 
report was circulated to all members of the 
Committee at least seven days prior to its 
submission to the House of Representatives 
and provision is made for the filing by any 
member, as part of the printed report, of in-
dividual, minority, or dissenting views. 
(2) All Committee or subcommittee reports 
printed pursuant to legislative study or in-
vestigation and not approved by a majority 
vote of the Committee or subcommittee, as 
appropriate, shall contain the following dis-
claimer on the cover of such report: 
This report has not been officially adopted 
by the Committee on Education and Labor 
(or pertinent subcommittee thereof) and 
therefore may not necessarily reflect the 
views of its members. 
The minority party members of the Com-
mittee or subcommittee shall have three cal-
endar days, excluding weekends and holi-
days, to file, as part of the printed report, 
supplemental, minority, or additional views. 
(c) Reports of Subcommittees. Whenever a 
subcommittee has ordered a bill, resolution, 
or other matter to be reported to the Com-
mittee, the chair of the subcommittee re-
porting the bill, resolution, or matter to the 
Committee, or any member authorized by 
the subcommittee to do so, may report such 
bill, resolution, or matter to the Committee. 
It shall be the duty of the chair of the sub-
committee to report or cause to be reported 
promptly such bill, resolution, or matter, 
and to take or cause to be taken the nec-
essary steps to bring such bill, resolution, or 
matter to a vote. 
(1) In any event, the report, described in 
the proviso in subsection (c)(2) of this rule, 
of any subcommittee on a measure which has 
been approved by the subcommittee shall be 
filed within seven calendar days (exclusive of 
days on which the House is not in session) 
after the day on which there has been filed 
with the staff director of the Committee a 
written request, signed by a majority of the 
members of the subcommittee, for the re-
porting of that measure. Upon the filing of 
any such request, the staff director of the 
Committee shall transmit immediately to 
the chair of the subcommittee a notice of the 
filing of that request. 
(2) Bills, resolutions, or other matters fa-
vorably reported by a subcommittee shall 
automatically be placed upon the agenda of 
the Committee as of the time they are re-
ported. No bill or resolution or other matter 
reported by a subcommittee shall be consid-
ered by the full Committee unless it has been 
delivered or electronically sent to all mem-
bers and notice of its prior transmission has 
been in the hands of all members at least 48 
hours prior to such consideration. When a 
bill is reported from a subcommittee, such 
measure shall be accompanied by a section- 
by-section analysis; and, if the Chair of the 
Committee so requires (in response to a re-
quest from the Ranking Member of the Com-
mittee or for other reasons), a comparison 
showing proposed changes in existing law. 
RULE 17. APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES, NOTICE

(a) Whenever in the legislative process it 
becomes necessary to appoint conferees, the 
Chair shall recommend to the Speaker as 
conferees the names of those members of the 
subcommittee which handled the legislation 
in the order of their seniority upon such sub-
committee and such other Committee mem-
bers as the Chair may designate with the ap-
proval of the majority party members. Rec-
ommendations of the Chair to the Speaker 
shall provide a ratio of majority party mem-
bers to minority party members no less fa-
vorable to the majority party than the ratio 
of majority members to minority party 
members on the full Committee. In making 
assignments of minority party members as 
conferees, the Chair shall consult with the 
Ranking Member of the Committee. 
(b) After the appointment of conferees pur-
suant to clause 11 of Rule I of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives for matters 
within the jurisdiction of the Committee, 
the Chair shall notify all members appointed 
to the conference of meetings at least 48 
hours before the commencement of the meet-
ing. If such notice is not possible, then no-
tice shall be given as soon as possible. 
(c) The Chair is directed to offer a motion 
under clause 1 of Rule XXII of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives whenever the 
Chair considers it appropriate.

SUSPENSION 
(a) A member of the Committee may not 
seek to suspend the Rules of the House of 
Representatives on any bill, resolution, or 
other matter which has been modified after 
such measure is ordered reported, unless no-
tice of such action has been given to the 
Chair and Ranking Member of the full Com-
mittee. 
(b) The Chair of the Committee shall not 
request to have scheduled any bill or resolu-
tion for consideration under suspension of 
the Rules that expresses appreciation, com-
mends, congratulates, celebrates, recognizes 
the accomplishments of, or celebrates the 
anniversary of, an entity, event, group, indi-
vidual, institution, team, or government pro-
gram; or acknowledges or recognizes a period

Let us pray.

honor. Continue to show our law-
makers the path where they should 
fall. Point them to the right road. 
When they have doubts, remove their 
uncertainty with Your wisdom. When 
they have fears, remind them that You

SECRETARY OF THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we 
begin this week on a joyful note: wel-
coming an outstanding individual to 
serve as the new Secretary of the Sen-
ate, Ann Berry from the office of one 
Senator PATRICK LEAHY. 
The position of the Secretary of the 
Senate dates back to April 8, 1789, just 
2 days after the Senate achieved its 
first quorum. Today, 1 day after the 
conclusion of Black History Month and 
on the first day of Women’s History 
Month, Ann Berry was just sworn in as 
the first Black woman to ever serve as 
Secretary of the Senate—another glass 
ceiling broken. 
It is a testament to her outstanding 
career as a public servant of the high-
est caliber. Over her 40 years in Wash-
ington, Ann has come to know the ins 
and outs of the Senate better than just 
about anyone else who works in the 
Capitol Complex. She came to Wash-
ington, a proud native of Birmingham,

S908 
March 1, 2021 
AL, and a graduate of the University of 
North Alabama, to work for Senator 
Howell Heflin. 
Clearly, word got around about her 
talents because, over the course of her 
career, she went to work for Senators 
CARPER, EDWARDS, MOYNIHAN, JONES, 
and, most recently, as Senator LEAHY’s 
deputy chief of staff, where she was an 
indispensable resource not only to Sen-
ator LEAHY’s office but to my team and 
to countless other Senators. 
I want to thank Senator LEAHY for 
parting with Ann and lending her con-
siderable talents to the full Senate. He 
told me he regretted her going, but he 
was so glad that the Senate had seen 
her talents. 
And thank you, Ann. Thank you for 
accepting 
this 
incredible 
responsi-
bility. Congratulations on beginning 
your historic tenure, and we all wish 
you the best as you work to bring this 
great institution to life. 
As we all welcome Ann to her new 
role, the Senate bids a fond farewell to 
Julie Adams and Mary Jones. Over the 
last 6 years, Julie Adams and Mary 
Jones have served as Secretary and As-
sistant Secretary of the U.S. Senate 
with impeccable skill and unflappable 
professionalism. 
Both are longtime veterans of Wash-
ington. Julie worked for many years 
under Leader MCCONNELL
and First 
Lady Laura Bush, while Mary served in 
the 
White 
House 
under 
President 
George H. W. Bush and, as I remember, 
because I was, I guess, chairman or 
ranking member—I can’t recall which, 
maybe both—as staff director of the 
Senate Rules and Administration Com-
mittee, where she did just a great job. 
Both of them are friendly and famil-
iar faces around here in the Senate. 
Both have earned the respect here in 
the Senate of just about everyone who 
has worked with them. 
Of course, Julie and Mary deserve 
special praise for their leadership over 
the last 12 months. As a global pan-
demic forced the Senate to adapt to 
new ways, they kept the Senate func-
tioning in the midst of this historic 
crisis. And in the wake of the horrific 
attacks on January 6, Julie and Mary 
were heroic—heroic—in getting the 
Senate back on its feet only a few 
hours after the violence had been 
quelled. 
To Julie and Mary, thank you. Thank 
you for all you have done. The entire 
Senate wishes you and your families 
the very best, and we look forward to 
seeing what the road ahead holds for 
both of you. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President pro 
tempore, now, on Senate business, the 
Senate will have a busy week ahead of 
it. Today and tomorrow, the Senate 
will confirm two more members of 
President Biden’s Cabinet: Dr. Miguel 
Cardona to serve as Secretary of Edu-
cation and Governor Gina Raimondo to 
serve as Commerce Secretary. 
The Senate will also confirm Dr. 
Cecilia Rouse to serve as the Chair of 
the Council of Economic Advisers, an-
other history-making pick who will be 
the first Black official to head that De-
partment. 
All three nominees are exceptionally 
well qualified. All have received bipar-
tisan support in their respective com-
mittees, including a unanimous vote in 
favor of Dr. Rouse. 
As we continue the fight against the 
pandemic on all fronts—in particular, 
the damage it has caused our schools 
and our economy—these nominees will 
have a difficult and important task 
ahead of them. It will be very good 
news once we have them confirmed and 
on the job. 
The Senate will then return to the 
American Rescue Plan, comprehensive 
legislation that will help us crush the 
virus, recover our economy, and get 
life back to normal. 
(Ms. HIRONO assumed the Chair.) 
Defeating the pandemic is national 
priority No. 1: getting our schools to 
reopen as safely and quickly as pos-
sible; helping small businesses hang on 
until the economy can come roaring 
back; keeping teachers and firefighters 
and other essential employees on the 
job; providing aid to the jobless, food 
to the hungry, direct cash payments to 
millions 
of 
Americans 
struggling— 
struggling—for the cost of rent, gro-
ceries, medicine, and utilities; speeding 
the distribution of the vaccine, which 
is the cornerstone to ending this aw-
fully dark chapter in American his-
tory. 
That is what our country needs, and 
that is what the American Rescue Plan 
will achieve. To paraphrase Franklin 
Roosevelt, we must do the first things 
first. 
Last week, the legislation passed in 
the House of Representatives. This 
week, the Senate will take up the 
measure. Let me say that again. The 
Senate will take up the American Res-
cue Plan this week. 
I expect a hearty debate and some 
late nights, but the American people 
sent us here with a job to do: to help 
the country through this moment of 
extraordinary 
challenge; 
to 
end, 
through action, the greatest health cri-
sis our country has faced in a century. 
And that is just what we are going to 
do. 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
another matter entirely, voting rights, 
the story of American democracy is a 
long and messy one, full of contradic-
tions and halting progress. It was a 
century and a half after our founding 
before women got the right to vote, an-
other 
half 
century 
before 
African 
Americans could enjoy the full rights 
of citizenship. It took mighty move-
ments and decades of fraught political 
conflicts to achieve even those basic 
dignities and establish the United 
States as a full democracy worthy of 
the title. 
But any American who thinks that 
today, in 2021, that fight is over—that 
the fight for voting rights is over—is 
sorely and, unfortunately, sadly mis-
taken. 
In the wake of the most recent elec-
tion, an election that the former Presi-
dent has repeatedly lied about and 
claimed was stolen, more than 253 bills 
in 43 States have been introduced to 
tighten voting rules under the per-
nicious, nasty guise of election integ-
rity. 
In Iowa, the State legislature voted 
to cut early voting by 9 days. Polls will 
close an hour earlier. And they voted 
to tighten the rules on absentee voting, 
which so many—the elderly, the dis-
abled, the frail—depend on. 
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers 
have proposed limiting ballot drop 
boxes to one per municipality—a mu-
nicipality of hundreds of thousands, 
and a tiny one gets the small one. I 
wonder why. I wonder why. 
In Arizona, one Republican legislator 
wants to pass a law allowing the State 
legislators—listen to this—to ignore 
the results of the Presidential election 
and determine their own slate of elec-
tors. One legislator in Arizona wants to 
pass a law allowing State legislators to 
ignore the results of the Presidential 
election and determine their own slate 
of electors. That doesn’t sound like de-
mocracy. That sounds like dictator-
ship. 
The most reprehensible of all efforts 
might be found in Georgia, where Re-
publicans have introduced a bill to 
eliminate all early voting on Sundays, 
a day when Black churches sponsor 
get-out-the-vote 
drives 
known 
as 
‘‘souls to the polls.’’ 
We have, supposedly—supposedly— 
come a long way since African Ameri-
cans in the South were forced to guess 
the number of jelly beans in a jar in 
order to be allowed to vote. But it is 
very difficult to look at the specific 
laws proposed by Republican legisla-
tures around the country, designed to 
limit voter participation in heavily Af-
rican-American and Hispanic areas, to 
lower turnout and frustrate election 
administration in urban districts and 
near college campuses, to gerrymander 
districts to limit minority representa-
tion ‘‘with almost surgical precision,’’ 
to specifically target and thwart Black 
churches 
from 
organizing 
voting 
drives—it is difficult, very difficult not 
to see the tentacles of America’s gen-
erations-old caste system, typically as-
sociated with slavery and Jim Crow, 
stretching into the 21st century and 
poisoning the wellspring of any true 
democracy—free and fair elections. 
We see a lot of despicable things 
these days, but nothing that seems to 
be more despicable than this. When you 
lose an election in a democratic soci-
ety, you update your party platform 
and appeal to more voters. You don’t 
change the rules to make it harder for 
your opponents to vote, especially not 
African Americans, Hispanics, Native 
Americans, and other voters who have

been historically disenfranchised. That 
response is toxic to democracy and, in-
deed, is the very opposite of democ-
racy. 
Make no mistake, these despicable, 
discriminatory, anti-democratic pro-
posals are on the move in State legisla-
tures throughout America. They must 
be opposed by every American—Demo-
crat, Republican, Independent; liberal, 
conservative, moderate—who cherishes 
our democracy. 
This is just incredible what they are 
trying to do—incredible. We must do 
everything we can to stop it. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 461 AND S.J. RES. 9 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
understand there are two measures at 
the desk due for a second reading en 
bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The lead-
er is correct. 
The clerk will read the bills by title 
en bloc for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 461) to create a point of order 
against legislation modifying the number of 
Justices of the Supreme Court of the United 
States. 
A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 9) proposing 
an amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States to require that the Supreme 
Court of the United States be composed of 
nine justices. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
order to place the bills on the calendar 
under the provisions of rule XIV, I 
would object to further proceedings en 
bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion being heard, the bills will be 
placed on the calendar. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
once again, our communities across my 
home State of Kentucky are enduring 
the aftermath of severe—very severe— 
weather. From east to west, heavy 
rains have drenched the Common-
wealth. Sadly, some of the hardest hit 
areas were still in the midst of trying 
to recover from last month’s dangerous 
ice and snow. Emergency crews, first 
responders, and now the Kentucky Na-
tional Guard are continuing to work 
around the clock to prevent this bad 
situation from becoming entirely trag-
ic. 
An entire nursing home in Magoffin 
County was evacuated as a safety pre-
caution. Feet of water submerged vehi-
cles and caused power outages in 
Calloway County. 
Wolfe County firefighters followed 
the light of a cell phone and saved a 
family of five who had been trapped in 
their car. 
Once again, Kentucky’s brave first 
responders are stepping up at a time of 
need. We are all grateful for their dedi-
cated efforts and praying for their safe-
ty. 
All Kentuckians can help the first re-
sponders by continuing to follow the 
recommendations of local emergency 
personnel. My team and I are closely 
monitoring the situation, and we will 
be ready to assist however we can. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. On another mat-
ter, at about 2 a.m. on Saturday morn-
ing, House Democrats rammed through 
the bonanza of partisan spending they 
are calling a pandemic rescue package. 
Only Democrats voted for it. Both Re-
publicans and Democrats voted against 
it. 
Last year, under a Republican Senate 
and a Republican administration, Con-
gress passed five historic coronavirus 
relief bills—five of them. Not one of 
the five bills got fewer than 90 votes in 
the Senate or less than about 80 per-
cent over in the House. 
Ah, but alas, this time Democrats 
have chosen to go a completely par-
tisan route. Even famous liberal econo-
mists and liberal editorial boards are 
saying their half-baked plan is poorly 
targeted to what families needed. 
We have gone from passing public re-
lief with 80 percent and 90 percent bi-
partisan supermajorities last year to 
the Speaker of the House ramming this 
through with just 50.7 percent of the 
House on Friday night. The bill con-
tains all kinds of liberal spending on 
pet projects with no relationship what-
soever to pandemic relief. 
Remember, we are almost to the 1- 
year anniversary of a leading House 
Democrat admitting they see this 
whole crisis as ‘‘a tremendous oppor-
tunity to restructure things to fit our 
vision.’’ 
So, sorry to all the American fami-
lies who have just been hoping to get 
their jobs back, their schools back, and 
their lives back. Democrats are more 
interested in some restructuring. That 
is why only 1 percent—1 percent—of 
this huge package goes directly to vac-
cinations—1 percent for vaccinations. 
That is why it proposes another 12- 
digit sum of Federal funding for K–12 
schools, even though science shows 
those schools can be made safe right 
now. About 95 percent of that funding 
won’t even go out this fiscal year. 
Ninety-five percent of the school fund-
ing in this bill won’t go out this year. 
And this is an emergency package? 
That is why they are pushing eco-
nomic policies that would drag down 
our recovery—like the House’s vote for 
a one-size-fits-all minimum wage pol-
icy that would kill 1.4 million jobs or 
continuing to pay laid-off workers a 
premium to stay home that would ex-
tend well into a recovery where job 
growth and rehiring will be pivotal. 
Whenever 
their 
long-term 
liberal 
dreams came into conflict with what 
Americans actually need right now, 
Democrats 
decided 
their 
ideology 
should win out. 
Well, it doesn’t have to be this way. 
We could have built more practical 
policies to help the American people 
move forward. Some Senate Repub-
licans literally went down to the White 
House and proposed that both sides 
work together, like we did five times 
last year. The administration declined. 
So this is where we are: a bad process, 
a bad bill, and a missed opportunity to 
do right by working families. 
f 
FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, on one final 
matter, last weekend brought dis-
concerting headlines for the supporters 
of freedom and democracy in Asia. In 
Burma the military junta’s month-long 
coup turned bloody. Eighteen pro-
testers have been murdered and at 
least a thousand civilian officials have 
been imprisoned on farcical grounds. 
In Hong Kong, China’s puppet regime 
arrested 47 democracy advocates, in-
cluding some who helped draw millions 
to the streets in peaceful protests in 
2019, and are now holding them without 
bail. 
Unfortunately, in both places, this 
sort of repression has become a famil-
iar part of life, and it could be a dark 
preview of developments elsewhere if 
the free world does not act. 
Even as Burma’s civilian government 
made history in 2015, the military 
made clear it would keep using cro-
nyism and constitutional manipulation 
to obstruct real popular control. In last 
year’s election, the people overwhelm-
ingly demanded true democracy and 
economic transparency, but that also 
raised the risk for those working pub-
licly to make permanent reforms. 
The military’s detention spree has 
hit Burma’s civilian leaders, including 
people like Mya Aye, a longtime Mus-
lim pro-democracy leader. It has also 
swept up some of the brightest eco-
nomic reformers working to fight cor-
ruption and grow prosperity—brave 
men like Bo Bo Nge, who spent years 
locked away in Burma’s Insein prison 
in the 1980s and 1990s, built a successful 
life abroad, and returned to help the ci-
vilian government craft economic re-
forms. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that this Washington Post ar-
ticle detailing Bo Bo Nge’s story be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S910 
March 1, 2021 
smuggled into his Yangon cell. After his re-
lease and continued persecution, he fled to 
the United States. 
He made a new life, rising from dishwasher 
to an economist with a six-figure salary. But 
his heart never left Myanmar, and armed 
with a Ph.D., he returned home as a demo-
cratic transition took hold, leading to his 
appointment in 2017 as deputy governor of 
the central bank—where he served alongside 
others who fought for democracy three dec-
ades earlier. 
Just after dawn on Feb. 1, five soldiers ap-
peared at Bo Bo Nge’s home in Myanmar’s 
capital, Naypyidaw, and demanded he come 
with them, according to his wife. She and his 
friends have not heard from him since. 
Bo Bo Nge’s fate, along with that of other 
intellectuals, lawyers and young leaders de-
tained in the military coup that deposed 
Aung San Suu Kyi’s civilian government, 
once again epitomizes dashed hopes for a bet-
ter future in Myanmar. These reformers and 
technocrats, whose skills and experience 
helped salvage the country’s antiquated fi-
nancial system in recent years, are now si-
lenced and subject to the whims of isola-
tionist generals. 
In Myanmar coup, grievance and ambition 
drove military chiefs power grab. 
At the same time, Myanmar’s security 
forces are cracking down on protesters, kill-
ing 18 on Sunday. More than 1,130 people, in-
cluding Bo Bo Nge, have been arrested since 
the coup. 
His predicament is made more urgent by 
his health issues and the fragile state of 
Myanmar’s economy, already battered by 
the coronavirus pandemic. Banks have closed 
their doors as hundreds of thousands of peo-
ple, including tellers, resist the coup by re-
fusing to go to work, pushing the economic 
system closer to collapse. The few military- 
linked banks that remain open have re-
stricted customer numbers, while the central 
bank is limiting withdrawals across finan-
cial institutions, raising fears of a cash 
shortage. 
‘‘When someone like Bo Bo arrived back in 
Myanmar, it was like a bottle of water to a 
person in the desert,’’ said Ba Win, a former 
provost of Bard College at Simon’s Rock, 
who helped Bo Bo Nge move to the United 
States. Bo Bo Nge, he added, ‘‘had the intel-
lectual training and discipline to look at 
economic issues in a way that transcended 
parochial political interests.’’ 
In an interview with Frontier magazine, 
Win Thaw, the military’s chosen replace-
ment for Bo Bo Nge, accused protesters and 
those participating in the civil disobedience 
movement of ‘‘destroying their own coun-
try’s economy.’’ 
‘‘Policies differ from one government to 
another, but they should have a common 
goal, which is to develop the country and not 
trouble the people,’’ he said. The military 
government, he added, is ‘‘doing their best.’’ 
Bo Bo Nge’s first stint in detention was at 
Yangon’s lnsein prison, where he served 
more than four years for participating in the 
1988 pro-democracy uprising, which the mili-
tary regime brutally crushed. The sprawling 
complex is one of the city’s most visible 
landmarks, where behind towering metal 
gates prisoners were subjected to torture and 
other inhumane treatment. There, Bo Bo 
Nge’s health began to deteriorate, and his 
teeth rotted from neglect, friends and family 
say. 
Locked up alongside academics and intel-
lectuals, he was exposed to lofty conversa-
tions about history, economics and philos-
ophy. He and his fellow prisoners would bury 
smuggled English dictionary pages under the 
muddy floors of their cells, studying them 
furiously when guards were not around. By 
the time he was released in 1993, Bo Bo Nge 
was fluent, and after a stint exporting taro 
stems harvested from Myanmar’s lnle Lake 
to South Korea, he moved to America’s lush, 
mountainous Berkshires, where he attended 
community college. 
‘‘He was immediately helpful, kind and so 
good-natured,’’ said Marion Lathrop, 84, who 
hosted Bo Bo Nge with her husband, Don, 
then a professor at Berkshire Community 
College. ‘‘It was kind of hard to grasp the 
fact that someone with that nature could 
have gone through that kind of ordeal.’’ 
Immediately, friends said, Bo Bo Nge got 
down to business, acquiring a driver’s license 
and a car to drive between his odd jobs and 
college. In 2001, two years after his arrival, 
he won a scholarship to Bard College, and 
after graduation, he pursued a master’s de-
gree in economics at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity. 
Through those years, he maintained a 
long-distance love with his future wife, Hnin 
Wai Lwin, better known by her nickname Me 
Kyi, whom he met on lnle Lake at her shop 
where she sold trinkets under a famed pa-
goda. Their international calls were a source 
of entertainment for her village—where resi-
dents could listen in on a central broadcast 
as phones were scarce—before she joined him 
in Massachusetts seven years after his depar-
ture, according to several friends. 
His first job was at a subsidiary of the 
American Institute of Economic Research, 
where he eventually earned six figures—epit-
omizing the American immigrant success 
story. Colleagues were ‘‘immediately struck 
by his brilliance,’’ said Seth Hoffman, now 
vice president of that subsidiary, American 
Investment Services. 
‘‘Given his particular skill set, Bo Bo could 
have gone on, if he was reoriented in a dif-
ferent direction, to be on a bond desk in a 
major investment bank,’’ Hoffman said. ‘‘He 
could have had a more comfortable life.’’ 
But Bo Bo Nge, heartened by a hopeful yet 
uncertain military-led transition to democ-
racy that began in 2010, wanted to do ‘‘some-
thing more than make money,’’ according to 
Ba Win. Inspired by a conversation the two 
had about a lack of skilled leaders in 
Myanmar—the military shuttered its best 
universities after the 1988 uprising and re-
opened them only in 2014—Bo Bo Nge pur-
sued a doctorate at the School of Oriental 
and African Studies in London, where Suu 
Kyi was a research student in the 1980s. 
When he went back to join the government 
as deputy central bank governor in 2017, the 
military had ceded some control to a civilian 
leadership and the economy was making 
great strides. Poverty had been halved from 
a decade prior, growth was picking up, and 
reformists were driving policy changes, 
keeping down inflation and modernizing the 
central bank. In the recent coup, several of 
Suu Kyi’s leading economic advisers were de-
tained, including Australian economist Sean 
Turnell, and Min Ye Paing Hein, a former 
World Bank economist who was the deputy 
industry minister. None have been heard 
from since they were taken by authorities. 
As the military tightens its hold on power 
and the prospect of reconciliation grows dim, 
the European Union and other Western coun-
tries 
are 
readying 
sanctions 
against 
Myanmar’s generals and their economic in-
terests, following moves by the United 
States. 
A general strike on Feb. 22, meanwhile, 
added momentum to Myanmar’s civil disobe-
dience movement. Many taking part in the 
resistance say sacrificing the economy is 
their only way to bring down the junta and 
achieve democracy. 
Zaw Zaw, a 41-year-old garment factory 
owner in Yangon, said he sold an apartment 
and his car to support those who are forgoing 
a paycheck to participate in acts of disobe-
dience against military rule. Soon he will 
run out of things to sell, he admits, but says 
he will do anything to keep the resistance 
afloat. 
‘‘The country’s economy was already in 
danger’’ before the coup, he said. ‘‘Whether 
or not the generals hold an election in a year 
as promised, the economy will collapse any-
way. So it is worthwhile to sacrifice every-
thing to bring them down.’’ 
Since her husband was taken on Feb. 1, 
Hnin Wai Lwin has had trouble sleeping and 
has lost her appetite. Memories of basic 
facts—when they arrived in the United 
States, her husband’s age—are fading or have 
become confused. She has moved back to 
Shan state up north, away from the mili-
tary-run capital, Naypyidaw, for her safety 
and that of their 5-year old son, who she said 
is always asking for his father, unable to 
comprehend what has happened. 
She cannot stop thinking about the health 
of her husband, who is in his 50s, and wheth-
er he has run out of the limited supply of 
medicines she packed in a bag before he left 
with the soldiers. In an interview, she said 
Bo Bo Nge was suffering from gastro-
intestinal disease and hypertension, for 
which he needs medical treatment. 
‘‘I am also not in good health, and we are 
not together,’’ she said. ‘‘I am very sorry. We 
should 
be 
together, 
whatever 
the 
cir-
cumstance.’’ 
Kyaw Ye Lynn in Yangon contributed to 
this report. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
even foreign nationals have been sub-
jected to unjustified detention. The 
world is closely watching the case of 
Sean Turnell, an Australian scholar 
who has spent years helping Burma’s 
civilian leaders unlock its economic 
potential. 
The administration has been right to 
condemn the junta and to consult with 
Congress on an appropriate response. 
But as Burma’s protesters begin to pay 
the ultimate price for speaking out, 
the United States must make it clear 
that military and police officials will 
face crippling costs of their own. This 
should 
include 
the 
military-owned 
holding companies, which have deep 
roots in Burma’s economy. It is time to 
lead an international effort to support 
the people of Burma. 
It is also time to strengthen our calls 
for an international response to Chi-
na’s shameless human rights abuses, 
beginning with Hong Kong. Another 
round of arrests in the last several 
days has sent a new wave of student ac-
tivists to prison with no due process. 
They join veteran pro-democracy per-
formers like my friends Martin Lee and 
Jimmy Lai, who were already rounded 
up. 
The United States cannot outsource 
our moral authority in championing 
democracy around the world. When we 
stay silent, the voice of the inter-
national 
community 
is 
channeled 
through forums where the most noto-
rious human rights abusers preside 
over their own trials. 
The ironically named U.N. Human 
Rights Council boasts a membership 
including such paragons of virtue as 
the Russian Federation, which has 
begun sending residents to prison for 
non-state-sanctioned religious beliefs; 
and Venezuela, whose rap sheet the

State Department spells out as ‘‘arbi-
trary detention,’’ ‘‘forced disappear-
ances,’’ and ‘‘extrajudicial killings’’; 
and Cuba, whose government exports 
repressive tools to countries like Ven-
ezuela; and, of course, the People’s Re-
public of China itself, where the hypoc-
risy stretches from repression in Hong 
Kong to internment and torture of the 
Uighur people in Xinjiang. 
The Biden administration has adver-
tised a foreign policy focused on human 
rights and democracy and quite pub-
licly announced its intention to rejoin 
the U.N. Human Rights Council. Fine, 
let Burma and Hong Kong and Xinjiang 
and Belarus be tests of this administra-
tion’s approach to the council. But the 
White House must not put much trust 
into this corrupted institution. We 
should be uniting like-minded democ-
racies around actions that the United 
Nations panels are either unwilling or 
unable to take. With respect to Hong 
Kong, the prior administration took 
several concrete steps, from closing 
PRC investment loopholes in Hong 
Kong to opposing targeted sanctions. 
Now is the time for the Biden admin-
istration to show its resolve as it con-
fronts serious tests of its own.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
MAIDEN SPEECH 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to speak on the Sen-
ate floor for the first time as a U.S. 
Senator from the great State of Ala-
bama. 
I want to share some thoughts on 
how we can work together as a team to 
improve the lives of our constituents 
and to provide more opportunity for 
the next generation of Americans, but 
before I begin, I want to take a mo-
ment to thank the people of Alabama. 
For the last 2 years, I have traveled 
the State, from Mobile to Muscle 
Shoals, from the Wiregrass to Lake 
Guntersville, and many places in be-
tween. I talked to folks from all walks 
of life. Mostly, I listened, which is 
something we can all do better. I lis-
tened to people’s hopes, and I listened 
to their concerns. I heard what they 
thought was going right in our country 
and State and what they thought was 
going wrong, and even after being a 
football coach my entire career, work-
ing day and night, running for the Sen-
ate was still the hardest thing I have 
ever done, but I enjoyed every minute. 
In the end, I asked the people of Ala-
bama to trust me with the responsi-
bility of representing them here in 
Washington, and they did. It is hum-
bling. It is an opportunity to serve my 
country that I respect, cherish, and 
will always honor. My staff and I will 
work hard every day to live up to that 
trust. 
Like the Presiding Officer, my con-
stituents sent me to Washington to 
represent them and to help make their 
lives better. I recognize we all have our 
differences, but we are all on the same 
team. We have got an offense and a de-
fense, but at the end of the day, we are 
still on the same team. One of the 
things we can do together as a team is 
to create more opportunity for more 
people. In my view, that starts with 
education. 
I have been an educator, a coach, and 
a mentor to young people for 40 years. 
I recruited 18- to 19-year-olds from all 
over the country and all walks of life. 
I saw how they lived. I was a father fig-
ure to hundreds of young men who had 
one or no parents. I coached young peo-
ple from all backgrounds—rich, poor, 
and everybody in between. I mentored 
young people of all races, religions, and 
economic backgrounds. 
As someone who has had a chance to 
travel across the country and this 
globe for my career, I have seen how 
other people live. One thing I have 
learned is that education is the key to 
freedom—the key to freedom—the free-
dom to live the life you want. I have 
seen firsthand how education can give 
you a leg up and a way out. It is a way 
to achieve the American dream. When 
we empower our young people with a 
quality education, we give them the 
gift of an opportunity, the greatest gift 
our country can give our citizens. And 
what I found out as a coach is that, 
when people are given an opportunity 
to better themselves, they usually take 
it. 
I think I can safely say I have been in 
more public schools than any Senator 
ever. Too often, I have found that we 
are failing our young people by not 
providing the quality education they 
deserve. It is not about money; it is 
about people; it is about what we value 
and what we teach. Improving edu-
cation in this country should be one of 
the, if not the top, priorities we have. 
That is why I am proud to be a new 
member of the Senate Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee. On the HELP Committee, we 
need to work together as a team to do 
three things. 
First, we need to recognize that par-
ents and teachers know how to best 
educate our young people in their com-
munities because we are all different. 
The Federal Government does not need 
to tell parents in Alabama how to 
teach their kids. We don’t need a one- 
size-fits-all 
education 
curriculum. 
What works in San Francisco will not 
necessarily work in Scottsboro, AL. 
Second, we should recognize that 
education takes many forms. Not every 
student in America needs to go to a 4- 
year college or university. To ensure 
our country remains competitive in the 
21st century, we need to promote 
STEM education to those students who 
have an interest in math and science, 
but to remain strong, this country also 
needs welders, plumbers, nurses, equip-
ment 
operators, 
electricians, 
and 
craftsmen. These are jobs that have ex-
cellent pay and great futures. If the 
Democrats want to pass a massive in-
frastructure bill, they need to first ask: 
Who is going to build it? That is why I 
will be looking for any opportunity to 
support career technical programs that 
prepare a skilled workforce. Our goal 
should be to restore America to a coun-
try that makes things again. 
No. 3, we have got to start teaching 
our young people moral values again. 
That starts with putting God and pray-
er back in our schools. Our kids need 
structure, and they need to learn right 
from wrong. I have watched everything 
that has happened in education over 
the past few decades from a front-row 
seat on my sideline as a coach. It is 
embarrassing. As a person who chooses 
to spend their career in education, I 
now have the opportunity to say some-
thing as a U.S. Senator. 
Our young people are our No. 1 hope 
for this country’s future. If we don’t 
recognize that, we are going to lose our 
country as we know it. As of 2018, the 
United States is 13th in the world for 
reading, 18th for science, and we are 
36th in the world for math. That is un-
acceptable. 
This country was built on hard work. 
It was built on competition, whether it 
is business or individual. Education 
and athletics teach you how to com-
pete, how to have grit, determination, 
and to work together as a team. Now, 
you can learn everything you want 
from books, but if you don’t learn to 
persevere and compete, it is hard to 
succeed. 
Some people in this country think 
that you are owed something simply 
because you live in the United States 
of America. This country doesn’t owe 
you a job or a paycheck. This country 
only owes you one thing, and that is an 
opportunity, but what is great about 
this country is that it also gives you 
the opportunity to fail. That might 
sound a little funny coming from a 
football coach who spent his entire ca-
reer trying to win, but here, if you fail, 
this country will give you a chance to 
get back on your feet and try to suc-
ceed again and again. You don’t get 
that opportunity in most countries on 
God’s green Earth. 
That being said, I appreciate the op-
portunity to serve with Chairwoman 
MURRAY and Ranking Member BURR, 
and I look forward to getting down to 
work and returning education to one of 
our top priorities. 
I yield the floor.

March 1, 2021 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
Miguel A. Cardona, of Connecticut, to 
be Secretary of Education. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, back 
in 2017, before anyone had ever heard of 
COVID–19, our Republican colleagues 
could hardly vote fast enough for a $1.9 
trillion tax bill. Most of the benefits of 
that bill went to the wealthiest people 
in America—$1.9 trillion in tax cuts, 
most of it to the ultrawealthy and 
large corporations. And of course there 
was little talk about the deficit and 
the debt when that was going on. 
Now we are in the midst of a pan-
demic, and COVID–19 has killed more 
than half a million Americans. Ameri-
cans are hurting. Our economy is hurt-
ing. Millions are unemployed. And our 
friends across the aisle are asking how 
little we can get away with doing at 
this moment in time. They want to 
know how much we can cut from Presi-
dent Joseph Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan. Can we cut money to open 
schools? Can’t we just wait? Let’s just 
wait and see what happens. That is 
their question. How about cutting 
funds to help keep families from losing 
their homes? How about cutting the 
funds for vaccination sites? How low 
can we go? 
One point nine trillion dollars in tax 
cuts for millionaires and billionaires— 
no problem. A President who denies the 
truth about a pandemic as it rages 
across America—no problem. But when 
Americans elect a new President with a 
mandate and a plan to finally break 
the back of this pandemic, get our 
economy back on its feet, get our kids 
back in schools, and actually help 
American families, suddenly a lot of 
folks on the other side of the aisle have 
lost interest. 
Do you remember last year? I do. We 
discovered this COVID–19 and started 
to worry about it, as we should. In 
March of last year, we passed a bill 
that cost almost $2 trillion—the larg-
est spending bill in the history of the 
United States—under President Trump, 
and it got 96 votes in the Senate—96 
votes. Every Democrat and every Re-
publican Senator who voted, voted for 
it, and I was one of them. Did I stop 
and say: Wait a minute; President 
Trump may get credit for this. No. We 
had an American crisis, a challenge, 
and we needed to respond to it. 
And then what happened in December 
of last year, while President Trump 
was still in office? The second COVID– 
19 rescue plan came through, some $900 
billion. I was one of those who were 
part of drawing it up, and I voted for it, 
no questions asked. We were still in the 
midst of a pandemic. The economy was 
flat on its back. I didn’t care that Don-
ald Trump was still President; there 
was work to be done for America. Nine-
ty-two Senators voted for that; 96 in 
March, 92 in December under President 
Trump. 
Well, how many Republican Senators 
are now stepping up to help us with the 
American Rescue Plan that President 
Biden has proposed? I am still waiting. 
None so far. Now it has become a par-
tisan exercise to talk about dealing 
with the real pandemic and economic 
crisis of this country. 
What is going on in this Chamber? 
Have we decided now, since we have a 
new President of a different political 
faith, that the other side cannot sup-
port efforts to increase the amount of 
money for vaccines and distribution 
across America, to send a cash pay-
ment to families who are struggling to 
get by, to give unemployment benefits 
to millions of Americans when those 
benefits are scheduled to run out in 
just 2 weeks? 
All we hear from the other side is: 
You know, we may be overspending 
here. We should have thought of this 
before. 
Yes, you should have, and you didn’t 
under a Republican President. Now it 
has become an issue. 
A year ago, at the beginning of the 
pandemic, 96 to zero for a $2 trillion 
COVID relief plan. Maybe if we had had 
an administration that wisely managed 
the COVID response, we wouldn’t have 
been in that mess. Maybe if we had had 
a President who for the first year of 
this coronavirus wasn’t making up sto-
ries that it is going to go away; it will 
disappear by Easter; it won’t be a prob-
lem if everybody would just take a shot 
of Lysol; a new chemical I have discov-
ered some of my friends are taking and 
all the rest—remember that? Remem-
ber those press conferences? And what 
was going on while the last President 
was 
ignoring 
the 
reality 
of 
that 
COVID–19 pandemic? America was get-
ting sick, and Americans were dying. 
We have 5 percent of the world’s pop-
ulation and 20 percent of the COVID–19 
deaths. What is going on here in a 
great nation like America? Well, for a 
year, we didn’t get it together because 
we didn’t have a President who accept-
ed reality. Now we have a President 
who accepts reality and wants to do 
something about it. He was elected to 
lead, and he wants to lead. 
Where is the Republican support? 
Democrats were there for the Trump 
plan; Republicans aren’t there for the 
Biden plan. We wasted time and re-
sources, 
but 
now 
President 
Biden 
wants to turn it around. 
The American Rescue Plan, proposed 
by President Biden and passed by the 
House of Representatives last week 
without a single Republican vote, no 
Republican support for it, has the sup-
port of 80 percent of the American peo-
ple—overwhelming majority of Demo-
crats and Independents, even Repub-
licans. It turns out the only people in 
America who are against this approach 
of taking this pandemic seriously are 
the Republicans in the House of Rep-
resentatives and apparently in the Sen-
ate. 
Every day this Senate delays passing 
the Biden American Rescue Plan, more 
small businesses close their doors, 
workers lose their jobs, parents turn to 
food banks and soup kitchens to feed 
their families, and more and more fam-
ilies face homelessness. 
One provision that was included in 
the House version of the American Res-
cue Plan will not be part of the Senate 
plan, and that is the gradual increase 
in the Federal minimum wage. 
Now, I understand. The rules in the 
Senate, particularly when it comes to 
reconciliation, as conceived by the late 
Robert C. Byrd, are almost impossible 
to understand and defend. I get it. I am 
not blaming any one person for that. 
That is a reality, and I have been here 
for a while, and I have seen it. So cur-
rently we cannot offer the Federal min-
imum wage under the so-called rec-
onciliation bill because of the Byrd 
rules. 
Our Senate Parliamentarian ruled 
last week that passing a Federal min-
imum wage increase as part of the res-
cue plan is not permitted under those 
rules. I respect the Parliamentarian’s 
judgment. I may disagree and I may be 
disappointed, but I respect her judg-
ment. Our Republican friends should 
know this, however: Senate Democrats 
aren’t going to give up on raising the 
minimum wage. The issue is not going 
away. 
Do you know how long it has been 
since we raised the minimum wage in 
America? Twelve years. Twelve years. 
The Presiding Officer knows that. That 
is the last time we increased the Fed-
eral minimum wage. 
Twenty-nine States have done some-
thing about it, but 21 have not, and we 
don’t have a change in the Federal law. 
That is the longest that our Nation has 
ever gone without raising the min-
imum wage since Congress created that 
wage in 1938. 
During this pandemic, billionaires— 
people like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill 
Gates, Mark Zuckerberg—they have 
done pretty well. They have seen their 
net worth increase by billions, even 
tens of billions of dollars. How about 
middle-class families? What do they 
see? They see their savings dwindle, 
and they find it almost impossible to 
make ends meet. 
Fortunately, as I said, many States 
are acting. Washington is not. In 29 
States, including Illinois, the State 
minimum wage is higher than the Fed-
eral minimum wage. The Federal min-
imum wage is $7.25 an hour. In Illinois, 
our State minimum wage is set to 
reach $15 an hour by 2025, just like the 
Biden plan. Most States that have in-
creased their minimum wage have done 
so because their State legislatures 
have come to the rescue. Some States, 
like Missouri and Arkansas, raised the 
minimum wage by ballot measures.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S913 
March 1, 2021 
Americans support raising the min-
imum wage. 
I see Senator LEAHY from Vermont 
has come to the floor. Remember when 
we used to have a colleague back there 
in the back row who would stand up 
and bellow about the minimum wage? 
His name was Ted Kennedy from Mas-
sachusetts. He didn’t let a month go by 
or 2 months go by without reminding 
us that a lot of people were struggling 
to get by in this country and we sit 
here in Washington ignoring it, and 
that is why he would push for an in-
crease in the minimum wage. 
We are told that $15 an hour is exor-
bitant by some and that it is going to 
hurt the economy. The truth is just the 
opposite. Raising the Federal min-
imum wage gradually to $15 an hour 
will strengthen the American economy 
because minimum wage workers are 
most likely to spend the money they 
get on the necessities of life as soon as 
they get it—food, clothing, housing. 
Last week, one of our Republican col-
leagues gave a speech and said that he 
worked for $6 an hour when he was a 
kid and he is opposed to the $15-an- 
hour minimum wage. Well, if you took 
that six bucks an hour and just 
matched it with inflation, it would be 
up over $15 an hour today. Reminiscing 
about the ‘‘good old days’’ of $6 an hour 
is only done by people who don’t have 
to live on $6 an hour. 
Contrary to popular misconceptions, 
most minimum wage workers are not 
teenagers. According to the Economic 
Policy Institute, 59 percent of workers 
who would benefit from the Federal 
minimum wage are women—women. 
They are taking a beating in this pan-
demic. They stay at home to watch the 
kids who can’t go to school, trying to 
deal with daycare that has closed 
down, losing their own jobs—that is the 
reality. 
Many mothers—two-thirds of them 
are the sole or primary breadwinners in 
their family and count on the min-
imum wage. Nearly one in four workers 
who would receive a raise under the $15 
Federal minimum wage is a Black or 
Latina woman. 
During this pandemic, America has 
relied on minimum wage workers to do 
the hard work and dangerous work in 
the pandemic. Do you want to know 
the real pandemic heroes? Do you want 
to reduce poverty and raise oppor-
tunity in America? Pay workers a liv-
ing wage. Allow workers to share the 
economic prosperity they are creating 
with their dedication and labor. 
At this moment, we may not have a 
path, but I hope we can find one. It is 
time for us to raise the minimum wage, 
to give the American workers the real 
wage they need to survive, and to show 
that we really do value the dignity of 
work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
want to associate myself with the 
words of the distinguished deputy lead-
er. Nobody has said it better. Nobody 
could. But in the meantime, we have to 
get up and vote. 
Madam President, I am going to put 
in a quorum call for just a minute, and 
then I will take it off. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, ear-
lier this month, actually for the first 
time in—earlier last month, I should 
say, in February, for the first time in 
our Nation’s history, the Senate con-
vened as a Court of Impeachment to 
try a former President for a high crime 
and misdemeanor. 
For 5 days, every Member of the Sen-
ate was here to hear presentations and 
arguments from an extraordinarily in-
telligent group of Congressmen and 
Congresswomen representing the House 
of Representatives. We also heard from 
counsel for former President Donald 
Trump. After listening to the compel-
ling evidence presented by the House 
managers, I voted to convict President 
Trump for inciting the Capitol riots on 
January 6, and I will have a lot more to 
say about my vote to convict the 
former President in a later statement. 
Today, though, I am going to speak 
about the unique role I had in this his-
toric trial as its Presiding Officer. It is 
unique in the history of the Senate, 
and I thought for my fellow Senators 
and, also, for historical purposes I 
would like you all to know some of my 
feelings. 
Now, I understand why some of my 
Republican friends were skeptical of a 
Democratic Senator presiding over the 
trial of a Republican former President. 
I noted the Constitution does not con-
template that the Chief Justice would 
preside over the impeachment trial of a 
former President, but I also note the 
impeachment process, no matter who 
presides, is inherently and often in-
tensely divisive. Presidential impeach-
ments have historically been partisan. 
Having a member of one particular 
party in the Chair presiding over the 
trial could understandably give some 
pause. 
Now, as my fellow Senators know, I 
did not ask, I did not seek to preside 
over this trial, but I am occupying the 
constitutional office of the President 
pro tempore, and because I am, it was 
incumbent upon me to do so. A Court 
of Impeachment is not a civil or a 
criminal court; it is a constitutional 
court. And the President pro tempore, 
as a constitutional officer, has histori-
cally presided over impeachment trials 
of 
non-Presidents. 
As 
President 
Trump’s term had expired before the 
trial began, the responsibility to pre-
side over this historic trial fell to me, 
as it would have anybody who would 
have been President pro tempore. I just 
happened to be. 
I was not going to shirk my duty. My 
staff and I spent hundreds of hours 
poring over the constitutional back-
ground of these trials. I read tran-
scripts. I read everything. And what I 
found is, throughout our Nation’s his-
tory, each President pro tempore has 
almost without exception belonged to a 
political party, and each has no doubt 
had their own personal and political 
views on the matters before the Sen-
ate. But when presiding over the Sen-
ate, as I go back through history, I see 
Presidents pro tempore have histori-
cally served as a neutral arbiter, 
issuing rulings where appropriate and 
preserving order. I consider holding the 
Office of the President pro tempore and 
the responsibilities that come with it 
as one of the highest honors but also 
one of the most serious responsibilities 
of my career here in the Senate. 
When presiding over an impeachment 
trial, the President pro tempore takes 
an additional—not just his regular role 
but an additional one to do impartial 
justice according to the Constitution 
and the laws. This is an oath that I 
take extraordinarily seriously. 
In fact, to demonstrate my commit-
ment to preside over the trial with 
fairness and transparency, before the 
trial I wrote a letter to every single 
Senator and the parties to the trial. In 
it I made clear my intention and my 
solemn obligation was to conduct the 
trial with fairness to all. I committed 
to adhering to the Constitution and to 
applicable Senate rules, precedents, 
and governing resolutions. 
I committed to consulting with the 
Senate’s 
esteemed 
and 
nonpartisan 
Parliamentarian, 
Elizabeth 
MacDonough, and I committed to being 
guided by Senate precedent should a 
motion or an objection or a request or 
an application be put before me. I reit-
erated that any decision I made—any 
decision I made—from the Chair would 
be subject to the review of the full Sen-
ate—every Democratic Senator, every 
Republican Senator, every Independent 
Senator. And I stated I would put any 
matter before the entire Senate in the 
first instance where appropriate in 
light of the precedents and practices of 
the Senate, giving all Senators an 
equal say in resolving the issue at the 
outset. I also informed all Senators, 
though, that I would enforce the Sen-
ate rules, and I would enforce the 
precedent governing decorum and do 
what I could to ensure the trial re-
flected the best traditions of the Sen-
ate. 
Now, with the trial behind us, I be-
lieve I made good on those commit-
ments. My job wasn’t to shape the trial 
or to direct or slant it in any par-
ticular way but to make sure the rules 
were followed, the proceedings were 
fair to all parties, consistent with the 
will of the whole Senate, and I believe 
it was.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S914 
March 1, 2021 
I did my best. I followed the advice of 
the Parliamentarian and enforced our 
rules and precedents. Where objections 
were raised, they were ultimately re-
solved without a vote challenging the 
rulings I made from the Chair. 
While I never faced this situation, be-
fore the start of the trial I had de-
cided—and I had informed the Parlia-
mentarian of my decision—that should 
a ruling of mine be appealed, I would 
abstain from voting as a Senator on 
the question of whether to sustain my 
own ruling. Now, I know from the Con-
stitution and the practices and the 
rules of the Senate, the Presiding Offi-
cer is fully empowered to do so—to 
vote—and it happens routinely during 
legislative sessions. But in going back 
through all the hundreds of pages—the 
thousands of pages—I could not find a 
historical precedent for Presiding Offi-
cers doing so during impeachment 
trials, and I was determined to strictly 
adhere to precedent, even if it limited 
my authority as a Senator in this in-
stance. 
Now I would note that, on two occa-
sions during the trial, I felt it was nec-
essary to remind counsel—and I did, as 
did Chief Justice Roberts during Presi-
dent Trump’s first trial—to refrain 
from using language that was not con-
ducive to civil discourse. On the final 
day of the trial, when it got a little bit 
heated, I was prepared to do so in 
stronger terms, if needed. Yet, during 
closing arguments, I believe neither 
side gave me reason to do so. 
Now, like those who presided over 
the three prior Presidential impeach-
ment trials in our history, I understood 
each of my decisions was important 
historically and would become impor-
tant precedents to guide those who pre-
side over trials in the future, just as I 
had read and studied the precedents of 
past trials. 
Since the conclusion of the trial, 
both Republican and Democratic Sen-
ators have thanked me for being fair, 
and I appreciate that greatly. I may 
have had a prominent role for this his-
toric trial, but I was committed to not 
shaping it in any way. I just wanted to 
give voice to our institution’s prece-
dents and rules and to otherwise let 
the Senate determine the trial’s struc-
ture and direction, to let each side 
present its case, and let the chips fall 
where they may, but let the Senate do 
its job. 
I have now had the opportunity to sit 
as a judge and juror in numerous im-
peachment trials, including three trials 
of Presidents. All were historic mo-
ments for the Senate and this country. 
I hold no illusion that the Senate was 
at its best for every moment of every 
trial, but each has nonetheless in-
creased my respect for our system of 
government and our Constitution. 
I was proud to uphold my oath as a 
Senator and as a Presiding Officer, my 
oath to do impartial justice according 
to our Constitution and the laws dur-
ing last month’s trial. There are some 
things I consider far more important 
than allegiance to any person or polit-
ical party, and my commitment to the 
Constitution and this great institution 
of the Senate are listed high among 
them. 
I have felt from the first day I came 
here that the Senate can be and should 
be the conscience of the Nation. I 
wanted to help make sure that con-
science was upheld, and I appreciate 
the fact that my colleagues elected me 
President pro tempore and gave me 
this opportunity. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUDGET EARMARKS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the Appropriations Committee is re-
portedly preparing to announce the re-
turn of earmarks. That is a process 
that, around here, we know. People 
back home might not know, so let me 
explain that the process of earmarks 
inserts individual projects designated 
for specific interests into a bill, most 
often an appropriations bill. When I 
say ‘‘individual projects,’’ it means 
Senators doing it for probably their 
district or their State. 
Earmarks are a practice that has be-
come a symbol to the American people 
of the waste and out-of-control spend-
ing in Washington. I am strongly 
against the return of earmarks. 
The earmark moratorium was imple-
mented as a direct result of the events 
leading up to the election of 2010, and 
there was clearly a mandate coming 
from that 2010 election to do away with 
earmarks. So people sometimes think, 
through the elections or through con-
tacting Congress, they don’t have an 
impact. In this case, it had a very dra-
matic impact that has lasted at least 
until now, and hopefully it will last 
longer. 
The American people spoke because 
they were worried at that time about 
the country’s growing Federal deficit 
and ballooning public debt—something 
we aren’t as concerned about now as we 
were then and we ought to be con-
cerned about more so now because the 
debt has more than doubled during 
that period of time. 
At that time, back in 2010, the debt 
was estimated to be 62 percent of gross 
domestic product. 
In 2009, President Obama and con-
gressional Democrats passed a $787 bil-
lion stimulus bill that was filled with 
wasteful spending, special projects, and 
unauthorized 
programs 
that 
com-
pletely violated the rules of the road 
for responsible governance. 
In September 2010—so at the time of 
the election I am talking about—in a 
Rasmussen poll, 61 percent of U.S. vot-
ers said cutting government spending 
and deficits would do more to create 
jobs than President Obama’s proposed 
$50 billion infrastructure program. It 
was pretty evident, then, from people’s 
opinion at that time, that the election 
of 2010 sent a clear message that the 
American people wanted Congress to 
stop wasteful spending. So it didn’t 
take long for President Obama to get 
the message. He had a weekly address 
on November 13, 2010, calling upon Con-
gress to stop earmarks. He said: ‘‘Given 
the deficits that have mounted over 
the past decade, we can’t afford to 
make these investments’’—in things 
like 
infrastructure, 
education, 
re-
search, and development—‘‘unless we 
are willing to cut what we don’t need.’’ 
Now, I am going to give you a further 
Obama quote, and it is a fairly long 
one, but it is coming from a Demo-
cratic President. 
I agree with those Republican and Demo-
cratic members of Congress who’ve recently 
said that in these challenging days, we can’t 
afford what are called earmarks. Those are 
items inserted into spending bills by mem-
bers of Congress without adequate review. 
Now, some of these earmarks support wor-
thy projects in our local communities. But 
many others do not. We cannot afford 
Bridges to Nowhere like the one that was 
planned a few years back in Alaska. Ear-
marks like these represent a relatively small 
portion of overall federal spending. But when 
it comes to signaling our commitment to fis-
cal responsibility, addressing them would 
have an important impact. 
We have a chance to not only shine a light 
on a bad Washington habit that wastes bil-
lions of taxpayer dollars, but take a step to-
wards restoring public trust. We have a 
chance to advance the interests not of Re-
publicans or Democrats, but of the American 
people; to put our country on a path of fiscal 
discipline and responsibility that will lead to 
a brighter economic future for all. And 
that’s a future I hope that we can reach 
across party lines to build together. 
Remember, President Obama said in 
2010 that earmarks are bad. Unlike 
2020—today we are in even more dismal 
fiscal shape with even larger Federal 
deficits and a ballooning Federal debt. 
According to the Congressional Budget 
Office, the Federal debt held by the 
public stood at 100 percent of GDP at 
the end of fiscal year 2020 and is pro-
jected to reach 102 percent of GDP at 
the end of 2021. 
In other words, even though we have 
the largest economy in the world, we 
owe more than the entire U.S. economy 
is producing in a year. If we stay on 
this course, CBO projects that by 2031, 
debt will equal 107 percent of GDP, the 
highest in the Nation’s history. 
America cannot afford to go back to 
including earmarks in some ill-con-
ceived effort to grease the wheels to 
pass legislation only because it in-
cludes the pet projects of Members of 
Congress. 
While a small part of the budget—and 
I would have to admit, earmarks are a 
small part of the budget—earmarks can 
cause Members of Congress to focus on 
projects for their districts or States in-
stead of holding government account-
able and being fiscally responsible. 
Congress should follow regular order 
by authorizing funding for programs

March 1, 2021 
with very specific criteria. Legislation, 
including 
funding 
bills, 
should 
be 
passed on its merits, not on whether an 
earmark is included. 
Dr. Tom Coburn, former Senator 
from Oklahoma, said: 
Earmarks are the gateway drug to . . . 
spending addiction. 
There is an insatiable appetite for 
projects, and this leads to large bills 
weighed down with spending our coun-
try can ill afford, whether we are talk-
ing about appropriations or authoriza-
tion bills. 
A Congressional Research Service— 
CRS, as we know it—study showed that 
from 1994 to 2011, there was a 282-per-
cent jump in earmarks in appropria-
tions bills. In the fiscal year 1994 ap-
propriations bill, there were 4,155, 
and—can you believe this?—by 2011, 
that number for earmarks had risen to 
15,887. Also according to the CRS, the 
total value of earmarked funds in-
creased from about $35 billion for 6,000 
earmarks in 2000 to over $72 billion for 
nearly 16,000 earmarks in 2006. 
Earmarks get out of control when 
there is no effective check on total 
spending, while at the same time, ear-
marks lead to overspending. Com-
mittee chairmen kindly say to the 
Members who have earmarks in bills or 
who want earmarks in bills: Are you 
going to vote for this appropriations 
bill if we put your earmark in? That 
sort of thing should never be a deter-
mination whether or not a Member 
votes for an appropriations bill. 
So you shouldn’t feel pressured to 
support a vicious cycle of increased 
spending on bad legislation just be-
cause it includes earmarks, especially 
in this time of the pandemic. Congress 
should be focused on targeted spending 
to continue to help the American peo-
ple who are suffering to recover, not 
finding ways to load up a bill with 
sweeteners that may be problematic on 
their own. 
According 
to 
a 
2016 
Economist/ 
YouGov poll, 63 percent of Americans 
approve the ban on earmarks; only 12 
percent disapproved. 
This quote by Citizens Against Gov-
ernment Waste President Tom Schatz 
to this publication, Just the News, 
makes a strong argument for not lift-
ing the earmark ban. He said: 
Earmarks are the most corrupt, costly, 
and inequitable practice in the history of 
Congress. They led to members, staff, and 
lobbyists being incarcerated. 
You know, there are people who went 
to jail because of how some of this stuff 
was handled. In the form of legalized 
bribery, Members of Congress vote for 
tens or hundreds of billions of dollars 
in appropriations bills in return for a 
few million dollars in earmarks for 
their State or congressional district. 
Earmarks go to those in power, as 
shown during the 111th Congress when 
the 81 members of the House and Sen-
ate Appropriations Committees, who 
constituted 15 percent of Congress, got 
51 percent of the earmarks and 61 per-
cent of the money. Restoring earmarks 
will lead to the same result. 
I have heard the argument that ear-
marks are needed to pass bills in a bi-
partisan manner. I have consistently 
been ranked among the most bipar-
tisan Senators by the Georgetown Uni-
versity Lugar Center. Check it out for 
yourself. I know from experience that 
true bipartisanship doesn’t come from 
voting for legislation that I might oth-
erwise have concerns about because an 
earmark or a pet project is included in 
the bill. True bipartisanship comes 
from reaching out across the aisle to 
reach consensus, even when there are 
disagreements on other issues, to real-
ly get things done for the American 
people. 
President Biden, in his inaugural 
speech, called for ‘‘Bringing Americans 
together. Uniting our people. And unit-
ing our nation.’’ He also recognized 
that Americans have serious disagree-
ments. Everyone knows that our coun-
try is deeply divided politically. I know 
from his time in the Senate that Presi-
dent Biden understands that people of 
good will can have honest disagree-
ments about policy, so he knows that 
unity does not mean dropping deeply 
held beliefs and accepting his policy 
agenda. He said: 
Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a 
cause for total war. 
Disagreements must not lead to disunion. 
Real unity requires true bipartisan-
ship and working together to discover 
what binds us together as Americans, 
even when we strongly disagree politi-
cally. Earmarks are not a way to bring 
this unity, and, in fact, would make 
this unity more difficult by attempting 
to paper over fundamental disagree-
ments with window dressing while by-
passing the real work of compromise. 
Now, in a similar vein, some people 
argue that earmarks are needed to help 
pass bills in a timely manner. In 2006, 
at the height of earmark spending in 
appropriations bills, only two appro-
priations bills passed on time. In the 10 
years prior to the earmark ban, Con-
gress never enacted more than four 
standalone 
appropriations 
bills 
on 
time. 
This holds true for reauthorization 
bills as well. Most, then, as you know 
the practice is, we just simply extend 
them for 1 fiscal year at a time. 
In the case of the past several high-
way reauthorization bills, which were 
notorious for earmarks before the ear-
mark moratorium, all needed multiple 
extensions before they were signed into 
law. 
I have also heard the argument that 
article I of the Constitution says that 
Congress holds the power of the purse 
and that Congress has ceded its own 
power without earmarks. I agree that 
Congress now cedes its own power but 
not by not having earmarks. Rather, 
Congress cedes its power by failing to 
follow the budget process and stick to 
a budget. 
Now, the greatest sin: Congress can 
be fairly accused of lazy legislation by 
drafting vague provisions granting au-
thority to Agency heads to work out 
the details, and most of those details 
are worked out through massive regu-
lation writing. 
Congress can reclaim its legislative 
authority by including specific guide-
lines for implementing programs in 
both authorization and appropriations 
bills. Congress should regularly review 
Federal programs to ensure that fund-
ing criteria reflect the needs of the 
Americans and engage in robust over-
sight of Departments and Agencies to 
ensure congressional intent is met. 
Rigorous oversight and well-drafted 
legislation that clearly sets out con-
gressional intent for how a program 
should be administered is the constitu-
tional job of Congress. 
A good example of Congress not keep-
ing the power of the purse and dele-
gating 
significant 
authority 
to 
unelected 
bureaucrats 
at 
the 
pro-
grammatic level is the Affordable Care 
Act, 
sometimes 
called 
ObamaCare, 
which was rammed through Congress 
on a party-line vote. The text was 
around 2,700 pages long, but the regu-
latory implementation of ObamaCare 
required well over 20,000 pages. That is 
a bad way to implement public policy, 
particularly considering that the law 
redirected one-fifth of the U.S. econ-
omy. 
On top of the law are tens of thou-
sands of pages of Federal rules and reg-
ulations administered by a score of 
Federal Departments, Agencies, and 
Boards. This isn’t how our Founding 
Fathers envisioned Congress protecting 
the American people, and it is a bad 
way to do business. 
As a matter of fairness, earmark 
project funding should be merit-based 
and competitive or allocated by for-
mula. Earmarks undermine State deci-
sion making over funds that are allo-
cated to States through formula-based 
grants. Political decisions should not 
preempt State and regional decision 
making. Earmarks should not be a 
shortcut for State and local govern-
ments engaging in long-term planning 
and budgeting for anticipated needs. 
And, furthermore, State and local gov-
ernments 
and 
other 
organizations 
should not be spending time and money 
to hire lobbyists to chase after Federal 
dollars in hopes of getting an earmark. 
The money spent on lobbying and 
travel to pursue an earmark should be 
applied toward the local project itself. 
If a Federal Agency or program isn’t 
working, then Members of Congress 
should fix it instead of seeking a carve- 
out. Highway authorizations bills are a 
perfectly good example of the problems 
with earmarks. 
In 1987, President Reagan vetoed the 
Transportation bill because of—guess 
what—too many earmarks. That bill 
included only 152 earmarks. In 1998, the 
Transportation bill, called TEA–21, in-
cluded 1,850 earmarks. The State of 
Florida challenged the earmarks in-
cluded for the State, arguing that the 
allocated funding did not address the 
actual transportation needs of the

State. The U.S. Department of Trans-
portation overruled Florida’s objec-
tions. 
In the 2005 bill—so I am going to an-
other Transportation bill; it was called 
the SAFETEA-LU—included 6,371 ear-
marks. Let’s go over that again. Let’s 
go back. In 1987, President Reagan ve-
toed a bill because there were only 152 
earmarks. Ten years later, TEA–21 in-
cluded 1,850 earmarks and then, 2005, 
6,371 earmarks. 
However, under the earmark ban, the 
last Transportation bill distributed 92 
percent of the funding to the States 
through formulas. And then, you know, 
that gives States and local govern-
ments control over the funding deci-
sion based on the needs of the 50 dif-
ferent States, based on safety, engi-
neering, and other objective criteria, as 
opposed to politically directed ear-
marks that totally sweep aside those 
criteria. It was almost a political deci-
sion where that money ought to be put. 
It should also be pointed out that the 
majority of the earmark funds in the 
past came straight out of the allocated 
formula dollars for each State, which 
then further eroded merit and State 
and local decision making. In other 
words, Washington politicians were 
making decisions better made by the 
nonpartisan boards in State capitols 
and local communities. And when I say 
‘‘nonpartisan boards,’’ I don’t suppose 
it is that way in all 50 States, but I 
know in most Midwestern States it is 
that way. 
I know that a lot of good has come 
from projects that I have helped sup-
port in Iowa, when we had our ear-
marks, and I certainly did not want 
Iowa to miss out on funding just be-
cause of a Washington dysfunction that 
we called earmarks. However, I also 
know that many of these earmarks dis-
rupted our State and regional planning 
efforts. I have no way of knowing what 
good might have been done had we not 
had earmarks banned earlier. I do 
know that I have faith that the Federal 
money that goes back to Iowa for 
Iowans and the Iowans deciding how it 
is to be spent is being spent thought-
fully and well and not with a lot of po-
litical consideration. 
Any good that might come from my 
being able to direct small amounts of 
Federal 
taxpayer 
dollars 
to 
some 
worthwhile pilot project would be 
dwarfed by the negative effects of re-
starting the mad scramble for ear-
marks. 
So I hope, my colleagues, the rumors 
I have been hearing about the Appro-
priations Committee wanting to re-
institute earmarks, I hope that those 
people would pay some attention to the 
history of it and particularly pay at-
tention to what President Obama said 
in 2010 about earmarks and not go 
through another process, maybe start-
ing out with just a few earmarks but 
getting up into more than several 
years, more than 10,000 earmarks in 
various appropriations bills, and then 
all of a sudden then have a mandate 
that came from the electorate, like it 
did in 2010, and both Republicans and 
Democrats come back to these halls 
where we have debate and make policy, 
saying no more earmarks. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A. CARDONA 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I couldn’t be prouder to stand in 
the Senate Chamber today and speak 
on behalf of Miguel Cardona, shortly to 
be confirmed by this body as the next 
Secretary of Education. 
Miguel Cardona is a man of deep 
commitment to his community and, 
with pride, a product of the Con-
necticut education system. I couldn’t 
be prouder to support him because 
President Biden couldn’t have made a 
better choice to be the next Secretary 
of Education. 
Miguel Cardona’s story is inspiring 
and compelling, a testament to the ex-
traordinary support he has enjoyed 
from his parents, from the community 
of Puerto Rico, who lived in Meriden, 
the support he enjoyed from the public 
schools and institutions of higher edu-
cation in Connecticut. His powerful 
and compelling story should be inspir-
ing to all America because he has lived 
the American dream. And for anyone 
whose language may be something 
other than English as their first lan-
guage, he has shown that people com-
ing to our public schools, with English 
as their second language, should see no 
bounds to what they can accomplish. 
He came to the public schools of 
Meriden as a second-language learner 
of English. He was raised in Meriden by 
Puerto Rican parents. He found an 
early passion for education. And his 
skill and dedication went beyond his 
own life. He did extraordinarily well 
and attended two Connecticut institu-
tions of higher education—Central Con-
necticut State University and the Uni-
versity 
of 
Connecticut—eventually 
earning his doctorate in education. But 
he went back to Meriden. He dedicated 
his life to the education of others, be-
ginning as a fourth grade teacher in 
Meriden and then becoming principal— 
the youngest in the State—and eventu-
ally assistant superintendent before 
just about a year ago being appointed 
as commissioner of education in the 
State of Connecticut. 
His climbing looks meteoric and mi-
raculous, but it was based on hard 
work and a dedication and passion to 
education for others, because he saw it 
in his own life and how it enabled him 
to live the American dream. 
For all of his accomplishments and 
that meteoric rise, he has remained 
deeply rooted in the Meriden commu-
nity, deeply committed to his roots in 
Puerto Rico, and deeply committed to 
his family. His parents, who should be 
so proud of him, are an inspiration to 
all of us who know them and who have 
seen their work in Meriden continue. 
Even as he has climbed the professional 
ladder, they have remained rooted and 
active and energetic in benefiting oth-
ers in Meriden. 
So to his parents, I say thank you for 
sharing with us Miguel. To his family, 
thank you for supporting him through-
out his enormous journey and adven-
ture. 
His extraordinary accomplishments 
have led him to this place of consum-
mate prominence in the educational 
professional community, and now he 
will do great things for the cause of 
education in our country, not just Con-
necticut. 
His service never stopped in the 
classroom. He brought that knowledge 
of what happens in the classroom to es-
tablish policy in Connecticut in an 
enormously challenging time. He took 
over as commissioner of education on 
February 26, 2020, at the time of 
COVID–19 lockdowns and school clo-
sures, which began just a couple of 
weeks after he assumed that responsi-
bility. 
But as he has done throughout his 
educational and professional career, he 
consistently reaffirmed his commit-
ment to students, parents, and teach-
ers because they are the core of our 
educational system, especially stu-
dents who have been potentially left 
behind. His bold vision and dedication 
to students and their families is ex-
actly what we need now in an Edu-
cation Secretary, providing direction 
and support to our Nation’s public 
schools—direction and support after a 
time when leadership was so sorely 
lacking and commitment to public edu-
cation was so unfortunately inad-
equate. 
As we know, COVID–19 has chal-
lenged educators, students, families, 
and school administrators, day in and 
day out, during this very difficult and 
painful period. Disadvantaged students 
who lack support and resources at 
home have been left behind. Teachers 
are strained and stressed by changing 
environments and a lack of resources. 
Parents 
are 
concerned 
and 
over-
whelmed, managing their children’s 
schooling and their own work at home. 
Students 
in 
higher 
education 
are 
drowning in student debt that has left 
them crippled financially and unsure 
about their future. 
These challenges pose a grave threat 
to the future of our children and our 
educational system, and we need a 
leader 
just 
like 
Dr. 
Cardona—one 
whom we have lacked, one who can re-
gain our Nation’s trust and reestablish 
faith in the leadership of our edu-
cational community at the very top in 
the Department of Education. 
He is someone who will put students 
back on their feet, in their confidence 
and their trust in education. He is 
someone who will put teachers, par-
ents, and students first, above special 
interests, because he has lived Amer-
ican education as the American dream. 
In Connecticut, he has seen firsthand 
in his own life how education can 
transform futures and enable all of us, 
through our children, to live the Amer-
ican dream just as he has done. And he

will do it in a way that is inclusive, 
that respects the drive for racial jus-
tice, because he has lived that move-
ment in his own life—the movement for 
racial justice. To end disparities and 
inequities are part of Miguel Cardona’s 
agenda because it is his life. It is in his 
DNA, and it is part of his heritage and 
his family. And that is the reason why 
I am so proud of his success, but also of 
his vision and his dedication to the fu-
ture of American education. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes for 
his confirmation. You will be proud 
you did, just as I am proud to stand 
here in support of him. He has lived the 
American dream, and he will open it 
through his vision and his courage for 
countless other young people who des-
perately need that faith in their coun-
try and its schools. 
Today, American public education 
has a future that is bright and prom-
ising with Miguel Cardona’s leadership. 
I am proud to say he is a product of 
Connecticut. His roots are there, and 
so is his vision and hope and faith. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
TEXAS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last 
Friday, I joined Governor Abbott, fel-
low Members of the Texas congres-
sional delegation, and several State 
and local leaders and joined President 
Biden on his first trip to Texas since 
taking office on January 20. We only 
wish it could have come under better 
circumstances. 
Texans, of course, are still reeling 
from the deadly winter freeze that crip-
pled our critical infrastructure and left 
millions without power and water. 
Thousands of Texans are still without 
clean water and under a boil instruc-
tion, and countless others are dealing 
with the damage caused by burst pipes. 
I truly appreciate the President and 
the First Lady coming to Houston to 
learn more about the ongoing response 
and recovery efforts, and I thank the 
President for answering the request of 
Senator CRUZ, Governor Abbott, and 
myself to order a national disaster dec-
laration. 
During times of crisis, Texans are al-
ways eager to lend a hand to their 
neighbors, and the last couple of weeks 
have proved to be no exception. I am 
always encouraged by those heart-
warming stories of folks helping others 
in ways big and small: welcoming peo-
ple into their homes, checking on their 
elderly neighbors, delivering hot meals 
to those in need, and much more. 
So I am glad the President and First 
Lady were able to see the incredible 
work also of one of the Houston area’s 
most reliable friends, and that is the 
Houston Food Bank. For more than 40 
years, the Houston Food Bank has 
fought hunger in the Houston region 
through a variety of programs serving 
Texans of all ages. When COVID–19 hit 
last year, the need for that assistance 
skyrocketed, as you might imagine. 
I was able to visit the food bank last 
summer to learn more about how they 
have adjusted their operations to keep 
up with the demand, while imple-
menting precautions to keep their vol-
unteers safe and healthy. So I was glad 
to join the President and First Lady to 
learn more about the incredible ways 
that the Houston Food Bank has con-
tinued to serve the community in the 
wake of this winter storm. 
As I have said before and, as the 
President reiterated on Friday in Hous-
ton, there is no red team, there is no 
blue team during a time of crisis. 
FEMA officials have said that dis-
aster response efforts work best when 
they are locally executed, State man-
aged, and federally supported, and I 
agree that is the appropriate formula. 
This structure gives local officials the 
ability to cater response efforts to 
their specific communities while tap-
ping into the range of resources avail-
able from the State and Federal Gov-
ernment. 
I want to assure my fellow Texans 
that I and the entire Texas delegation 
here in Congress will continue to do ev-
erything we can to be responsive to the 
needs that they have. Part of that, 
though, is through rapid mobilization 
of resources. After Governor Abbott, as 
I said, made the formal request for an 
emergency disaster declaration, Sen-
ator CRUZ and I sent a letter to Presi-
dent Biden urging him to grant that re-
quest. And, as I said, he did so without 
delay. 
So this formal disaster declaration 
has allowed our State to receive a 
range of resources to respond to the 
crisis, 
including 
blankets, 
bottled 
water, generators, and additional fuel. 
These resources were vital to sus-
taining hospital operations and sup-
porting the most vulnerable Texans 
while power and water were being re-
stored. 
Senator CRUZ and I also wrote to the 
President urging him to grant the Gov-
ernor’s request for a major disaster 
declaration and all types of public and 
individual 
assistance 
for 
each 
of 
Texas’s 254 counties. A major disaster 
declaration opens up even more Fed-
eral resources to help communities and 
individuals recover in the aftermath of 
an emergency like this. It can include 
everything from housing assistance for 
folks who are unable to stay in their 
home due to water leakage and burst 
pipes to unemployment assistance to 
crisis counseling. 
So far, President Biden has approved 
the major disaster declaration for 126 
counties, and I know State and local 
leaders are working with the adminis-
tration to seek approval for the re-
maining counties. 
Insurance industry leaders believe 
this could be the costliest weather 
event in our State’s history, and we 
have to do everything we can to lessen 
the burden on Texas families. 
Of course, my staff and I are in close 
contact with State and local leaders 
who are managing and executing the 
response, and we are constantly look-
ing for ways to assist and move the re-
covery along. 
In the aftermath of these widespread 
outages, of course, two questions jump 
out at you: One is, What happened? 
And, two, how do we prevent it from 
ever happening again? 
We know now, at least so far, that 
there wasn’t a single point of failure. 
But where it has to do with the power, 
this was the result of failures in equip-
ment across the State that weren’t 
properly winterized. Natural gas lines, 
wind turbines, and other power equip-
ment froze, cutting off a huge percent-
age of our power generation capacity. 
The remaining generators were over-
loaded by the sky-high demand of these 
subzero temperatures, and much of 
Texas went through rolling blackouts 
and more. 
This storm claimed the lives of near-
ly 80 Texans. It left millions without 
power and water for several days. It de-
stroyed homes and businesses and cre-
ated a sense of fear across the State. 
We need to do what we can now to 
ensure that Texas’s critical infrastruc-
ture will be able to withstand anything 
Mother Nature sends our way. It is not 
just about Texas. It is really about the 
critical infrastructure throughout the 
United States. 
I am working on a measure to build 
grid resiliency, so we can maintain re-
liable power throughout any type of ex-
treme weather. Whether it is a polar 
vortex or a heat wave or a hurricane or 
tornado, our grids and energy sources 
across the country must be able to op-
erate without disruption. This should 
be a bipartisan priority for folks from 
every corner of the United States. 
In Texas, we are accustomed to our 
infrastructure being able to withstand 
the high temperatures we are used to 
during the summer, but not the rare 
subzero temperatures that paralyzed 
the State 2 weeks ago. In other parts of 
the country, grids may face the oppo-
site problem: They are able to operate 
during freezing temperatures but not 
during a heat wave. I am trying to 
work on a way to get funding to the 
States to help build grid resiliency in a 
way that makes sense for each of those 
specific needs. 
Our Nation has had issues with fund-
ing grid resiliency and modernization 
efforts, and this is a good opportunity 
to make an investment in that infra-
structure. My hope is that this will be 
a big bipartisan effort, including fellow 
Members of the Texas delegation and 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
here in the Senate. We need to do ev-
erything we can as Americans and Sen-
ators to strengthen and modernize our 
grid before it is tested again. Team 
Texas will do everything we can to get 
our neighbors on the road to recovery 
and prevent us from experiencing wide-
spread outages in the future. 
In conclusion, I want to thank every-
one who has supported our State in 
ways big and small over the last couple 
of weeks and who will no doubt work 
with us in our efforts to come back 
stronger in the days that lie ahead. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S918 
March 1, 2021 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
U.S. POSTAL SERVICE 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, it has 
long been said that ‘‘neither snow nor 
rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays’’ 
our U.S. postal ‘‘couriers from the 
swift completion of their appointed 
rounds.’’ These words, in fact, are chis-
eled in granite above the entrance to 
the post office on 8th Avenue in New 
York City—one of the grandest post of-
fices in our Nation. It is the adopted 
creed of the faithful and hard-working 
letter carriers and frontline workforce 
of our Postal Service. 
As I have said before, I have no beef 
with the men and women of our Postal 
Service, but I have real and deep con-
cerns about how the Postal Service is 
being run under the current Post-
master General. 
President Biden doesn’t get to choose 
a new Postmaster General just because 
he is the new President. In fact, the 
current officeholder, Louis DeJoy, was 
chosen by the Board under the previous 
administration. 
Weeks ago, I joined with many col-
leagues and with Chairman PETERS of 
the Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee, which is re-
sponsible for the Postal Service, to 
send a letter to Postmaster General 
DeJoy to restore on-time delivery and 
stop the harmful systemwide changes 
that have caused unacceptable mail 
delays. 
Sadly, that is not the first time I 
have had to reach out, with Senators in 
this body, to the Postmaster General. 
In fact, on five separate occasions, we 
have written the Postmaster General, 
between August and February, last 
year to this year. We have demanded 
transparency. We have insisted on the 
restoration of mail sorting machines. 
We have asked for assistance with 
vote-by-mail deliveries and wrote for 
just simple answers to pending con-
stituent inquiries. 
In my hometown of Wilmington, DE, 
last August, I joined our attorney gen-
eral, Kathy Jennings, my senior Sen-
ator, 
TOM
CARPER, 
Congresswoman 
LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER, and a series of 
union leaders for a day of action to 
save the Postal Service. 
A few days later, I drove myself to 
our mail distribution center in New 
Castle after leadership of the Postal 
Service denied my request to visit. 
Thanks to having been alerted by some 
frontline employees, I drove around 
back and was able to see a dismantled 
massive piece of mail handling equip-
ment left outside in the rain. 
In January and February alone, my 
office received hundreds of messages 
from constituents complaining about 
mail issues. Since last April, I have 
heard from nearly 5,000 Delawareans— 
folks asking for robust funding for the 
Postal Service, wanting stronger vote- 
by-mail initiatives, and hundreds and 
hundreds of them reporting delays in 
the mail. 
I want to take a few minutes, if I 
might, and just go through some of 
these concerns I have heard, which, I 
have also heard from colleagues, are 
being replicated across our Nation. 
Gloria Lester, down in Lewes, in Sus-
sex County, said that mail that pre-
viously took just 3 to 4 days is now 
taking her 4 to 6 weeks. Her bills are 
due before she even gets the state-
ments. And her husband’s VA medica-
tion took a month to arrive from the 
date they mailed it. 
Jim Nichols of Milford wrote con-
cerned about the delay in getting his 
newspapers, his magazines, and his 
other periodicals. 
And Jim is not alone. I have heard 
from local and regional newspapers 
that rely on the Postal Service to de-
liver out-of-State and out-of-area sub-
scribers. 
We have a beach area with a lot of 
homeowners who live here in our Na-
tion’s Capital or elsewhere throughout 
the region. And Chris Raush, who is 
with the Cape Gazette, which gets 
mailed to folks all over our region, told 
me some of their out-of-State sub-
scribers don’t receive the paper for a 
month, and then, when they do, they 
get a big bundle of old papers. And now 
with papers not showing up weeks at a 
time, they have had to tell subscribers 
this is just out of their control and 
offer refunds. 
Megan 
Stibbe, 
of 
the 
Delmarva 
Farmer, another local paper, said that 
she has ‘‘been having a lot of trouble 
with Delaware deliveries. The postal 
system,’’ as she said in writing to me, 
‘‘is very screwed up right now. Del-
marva Farmers have not received their 
newspapers at all in January.’’ 
I have received dozens and dozens 
more emails, texts, letters, and phone 
messages from frustrated constituents. 
Dianne Boyle, of Magnolia, DE, felt 
so strongly about this ongoing debacle 
of delayed delivery in the Postal Serv-
ice that she hand delivered her own let-
ter of concern to my Dover office. 
Richard Bilkski of Selbyville, a gen-
tleman with real and significant heart 
issues that require him to be on medi-
cation, was down to his very last pill 
on January 25. After calling and calling 
and calling, it turned out that his 
medication had been sitting in the Wil-
mington post office for 3 weeks. 
Toby Rubenstein, from Hockessin, 
wrote me and said: 
I have paid my bills by check all my life. 
[And now] the Postal Service is so unreli-
able, that I now have monthly problems pay-
ing [my] bills on time. [And] I’m not alone in 
this. 
Claudette Richardson of Newark, DE, 
wrote me a note saying that she had 
mailed her sister a Christmas card on 
December 14, and it arrived February 
12. 
Marcy Leib Rolmann wrote me and 
said: Our ‘‘mail here in Sussex County 
as everywhere is horrible, despite our 
great letter carriers.’’ 
Geiana Hollis of Wilmington wrote to 
me last month because of her passport 
sitting idle at a Philadelphia distribu-
tion center for 10 days. She was set to 
travel abroad and had to delay her trip. 
Bill Powers, former county council-
man I know well from New Castle 
County, a member of the Farm Bureau, 
is a longtime turkey grower who now 
provides fresh eggs for local farmers 
markets. Bill has experienced signifi-
cant losses with turkey and chick de-
liveries and called my office with con-
cerns. 
And I want, before I close, to men-
tion one last story, from Trebs Thomp-
son, of Newark, an egg farmer with 
Whimsical Farms. Trebs wrote: 
Largely our postal system has been a 
jewel. It handles a large volume of mail 
cheaply, with a high degree of speed and ac-
curacy. Many of us depend on it for govern-
ment paperwork, medications, orders, pay-
ments, and for farmers like me, seeds [and] 
day-old chicks. 
The Post Office has been shipping day-old 
chicks to farms like mine for over 100 years. 
Today, all 20 baby hens arrived cold and life-
less. I cried [as I opened the box]. The [post-
al] supervisor cried. The gentleman who nor-
mally delivers my mail apologized profusely, 
but [it is] not his fault. 
Whatever one feels about mail-in ballots or 
politics, I am asking you to put this aside 
and do what you can to restore the Postal 
Service. 
Trebs Thompson is right. No farmer 
should ever have to open a box of dead 
chicks. No constituent should have to 
hand deliver a letter to their Senator. 
Our veterans shouldn’t be going with-
out lifesaving medication. 
Postmaster DeJoy appeared before 
Members of the House last week and 
apologized for the slow mail delivery 
and said he has a forthcoming plan, 
which I am concerned includes further 
cuts to delivery service. 
So let me summarize. My under-
standing is that DeJoy’s plans for the 
future of the Postal Service include 
higher prices and slower delivery. Dela-
wareans are tired, and our Postal Serv-
ice workers are tired, too, of the con-
straints placed on them. How will we 
solve this problem? In my view, we 
need to confirm as quickly as possible 
President Biden’s nominees to the 
Postal 
Board 
of 
Governors: 
Ron 
Stroman, 
Amber 
McReynolds, 
and 
Anton Hajjar—all folks who have deep 
experience in the postal system. They 
could get us back on track. 
We also have to prioritize invest-
ments in the Postal Service. Congress 
secured $10 billion for the Postal Serv-
ice in the unanimously passed CARES 
Act to provide the resources to main-
tain operation at a time when families 
are relying on mail service more than 
ever during this pandemic. 
I will continue to support the Postal 
Service. I will continue to petition the 
Postmaster General, and I won’t stop 
until there is a solution to this critical 
and pressing issue. Our letter carriers

AUTO FOR VETERANS ACT 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, last 
week, I was pleased to join my col-
league from West Virginia, Senator 
JOE MANCHIN, in introducing the Ad-
vancing Uniform Transportation Op-
portunities for Veterans Act, better 
known as the AUTO for Veterans Act. 
I am pleased that Senators BOOZMAN, 
HASSAN, and BLUNT
have joined as 
original cosponsors. 
Our bill would lessen the financial 
burden on severely disabled veterans 
who require special adaptive equip-
ment to drive a motor vehicle. It would 
do so by increasing access to the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs auto-
mobile grant program. 
The VA currently provides eligible 
veterans with a one-time grant of ap-
proximately $21,400 to be used to pur-
chase a new or used automobile and 
necessary adaptive equipment, such as 
specialized pedals and switches. This 
grant is often used in conjunction with 
the VA’s special adaptive equipment 
grants, which help our veterans pur-
chase additional adaptive equipment, 
such as powered lifts, for example, for 
an existing automobile to make it safe 
and feasible for a veteran with disabil-
ities. 
Although veterans can receive mul-
tiple special adaptive equipment grants 
over the course of their lives, for some 
reason they are limited to just a single 
automobile grant. The current limita-
tion fails to take into account that a 
veteran is likely to need more than one 
vehicle in his or her lifetime. In fact, 
the Department of Transportation re-
ports that, in 2019, the average age of a 
household vehicle was 11.8 years, and a 
vehicle that has been modified struc-
turally tends to have a shorter useful 
life. 
According to the VA independent 
budget prepared by Disabled American 
Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of Amer-
ica, and the VFW, the substantial costs 
of modified vehicles, coupled with in-
flation, present a financial hardship for 
many disabled veterans who need to re-
place their primary mode of transpor-
tation once their car or van or truck 
reaches its lifespan. The National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
estimates that a new vehicle modified 
with adaptive equipment will cost any-
where from $20,000 to $80,000. These are 
significant costs for a veteran with dis-
abilities to incur to replace his or her 
primary mode of transportation. That 
is why veterans should be eligible to 
receive a vehicle grant every 10 years 
and 
our 
legislation, 
the 
Collins- 
Manchin bill, would do just that. 
A Maine veteran whom I know well, 
Neal Williams of Shirley, ME, used a 
VA automobile grant in 1999 to pur-
chase an adaptive vehicle, a Ford 
Econoline van. He has also had to pur-
chase several adaptive vehicles since 
1999, with each one lasting over 250,000 
miles until they simply were no longer 
roadworthy. His current vehicle now 
has over 100,000 miles, and soon he will 
need a new one. He told me that pur-
chasing a new van will cost him well 
over $50,000, which is more than he paid 
for his home in rural Maine. This is an 
enormous burden on our disabled vet-
erans who need to purchase expensive 
adaptive vehicles in order to drive safe-
ly or to drive at all. 
Madam President, I feel like I am 
preaching to the choir here. Our Nation 
owes our veterans such an enormous 
debt. It is a debt that truly can never 
be fully repaid. Let’s honor our com-
mitment to our veterans by continuing 
to support their needs, including the 
needs of veterans who are disabled and 
need this adaptive technology for their 
vehicles long after they have been dis-
charged or retire from Active Duty. 
This is a simple bill, but it is a bill 
that would make such a difference for 
so many of our disabled veterans who 
need vehicles with adaptive equipment 
so that they can drive themselves and 
drive safely. The AUTO for Veterans 
Act is an important step that we can 
take to meet this need and help those 
who have made so many sacrifices to 
serve our Nation. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join us 
in helping our Nation’s veterans by 
supporting this bill. 
Thank you. 
NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A. CARDONA 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
after 4 years of Secretary DeVos’ ef-
forts to promote greater privatization 
of our education system and dismantle 
the civil rights of students, Miguel 
Cardona is the person we need to re-
store the promise of America’s schools. 
A former public school teacher who 
went on to be a leader in the same dis-
trict where he was once an English 
learner, Dr. Cardona has demonstrated 
a lifelong commitment to our public 
schools and the belief that all children 
are entitled to a quality education in a 
safe and nurturing learning environ-
ment. He also has a proven track 
record of effectively responding to the 
pandemic, helping students overcome 
the digital divide, and safely reopening 
schools as the Connecticut Education 
Commissioner. 
The pandemic has upended our edu-
cation system, disrupting learning and 
exacerbating inequities. From day one 
as Secretary of the Department of Edu-
cation, Dr. Cardona will need to be pre-
pared to meet the challenges facing our 
students and educators, from address-
ing learning loss and social, emotional, 
and mental health to reversing declin-
ing higher education enrollment rates 
and a sky-rocketing affordability cri-
sis. Additionally, as deep disparities 
continue to shortchange low-income 
students, students of color, and stu-
dents with disabilities, Dr. Cardona 
will be a key partner in working to-
ward closing these funding and edu-
cational opportunity gaps. 
I am proud to support Dr. Cardona’s 
nomination, and I look forward to 
working together to at last make good 
on our promises to fully fund title I 
and IDEA, to expand access to quality 
early childhood education and commu-
nity schools, and to ensure higher edu-
cation is accessible for everyone. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
rise today to voice my strong support 
for Dr. Cardona’s nomination to serve 
as Secretary of Education. 
Across the country, students, par-
ents, and educators are in crisis. Every 
day without an experienced leader at 
the Department of Education is a day 
that we are losing precious ground. 
Back in my home State of Washington, 
I heard from a mother in Yakima 
whose children shared one iPhone to 
learn. I heard from a father of a high 
school freshman in Spokane, worried 
about the social and psychological toll 
the pandemic is taking on his son. I 
heard from students at the Lummi Na-
tion, trying to focus on remote classes 
while in multigenerational households 
on a shared, spotty broadband. 
I know there are so many similar sto-
ries from people in my State and across 
the country about how this pandemic 
is making life harder, the ways it has 
set back students from where they 
would be in a typical year, denied them 
access to critical school resources, 
deepened longstanding inequities, and 
so much more. 
From early education to higher edu-
cation, we need to make sure students 
and their families have the support 
they need to not only get a high-qual-
ity education but to make sure every 
student can try. 
Democrats want to get students safe-
ly back in the classrooms for in-person 
learning as soon as possible. So I am 
glad the Biden administration put for-
ward clear, science-based, public health 
guidance schools have long needed. 
There is no one solution that will en-
sure safety on its own as our country 
ramps up vaccine distribution. 
Congress has to do its part and pass 
the American Rescue Plan to provide 
vital funding for schools—to secure 
adequate PPE, to reduce class sizes to 
increase social distancing, to improve 
ventilation and contract tracing, and 
to take all the steps they need to do so 
that they can safely reopen for in-per-
son learning or provide high-quality 
distance learning if it is not safe in 
their community to return to the 
classroom and so that they can assess 
and address the damage this pandemic 
has done, especially the way it has 
deepened inequities that have hurt stu-
dents of color, students of families 
with low incomes, students with dis-
abilities, 
LGBTQ 
students, 
women, 
English learners, students experiencing 
homelessness, and so much more. 
At this moment of crisis, Dr. Cardona 
is exactly the leader we need at the De-
partment of Education to tackle these 
challenges. During his confirmation

hearing 
in 
the 
Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee, he 
demonstrated beyond a doubt that he 
has experience, principles, and the per-
spective that we need in this critical 
role. That is why Dr. Cardona was 
voted out of our committee by an over-
whelming 17-to-5 margin with broad bi-
partisan support. 
Dr. Cardona will come to the Depart-
ment as a proven leader who will work 
with students, parents, caregivers, edu-
cators, 
school 
administrators, 
and 
State, local, and Tribal officials. Just 
as importantly, he will come to the De-
partment 
as 
a 
former 
elementary 
school teacher, an adjunct professor, a 
principal, 
assistant 
superintendent, 
and former English learner himself who 
knows we have a responsibility to 
make sure every single student has ac-
cess to high-quality public education. 
At our hearing, he made clear he will 
fight against longstanding inequities 
and for every student, including those 
who have not had a champion at the 
Department for the last 4 years. He 
spoke about his commitment to accom-
plishing President Biden’s goal of safe-
ly reopening the majority of our K–8 
schools for in-person learning within 
his first 100 days in office. 
He showed he understands the chal-
lenge the Department is facing is larg-
er than just seeing schools and stu-
dents and parents and educators safely 
through this pandemic. It is making 
sure we come back stronger and fairer. 
Accomplishing that means ensuring 
childcare and early education is avail-
able and affordable for every family; 
ensuring every student can get a high- 
quality public education no matter 
where they live or how much money 
they or their families have; rooting out 
longstanding inequities from our edu-
cation system by tackling racism, 
sexism, ableism, and bigotry head-on; 
and ensuring that higher education is 
accessible, affordable, accountable, and 
safe for every single student. 
We have a lot of work to do for our 
schools and students. We have an excel-
lent candidate to get it done, and we 
have no time to waste. I urge all of our 
colleagues who have heard from a par-
ent who wants to get their child back 
in the classroom safely—I am sure ev-
eryone has—to join us and vote to con-
firm Dr. Cardona as Secretary of Edu-
cation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous con-
sent to complete my remarks before 
the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to echo Chairwoman 
MURRAY’s comments, to suggest and 
commend to my colleagues the nomi-
nation of Miguel Cardona to be the 
next Secretary of Education. 
There is no one better suited for this 
job 
in 
this 
moment 
than 
Miguel 
Cardona, and I couldn’t be more ex-
cited on behalf of my constituents, on 
behalf of the people of Meriden, CT, to 
be here on the floor to tell you just a 
little bit about why Miguel Cardona 
makes so much sense for this moment. 
As Senator MURRAY laid it out for us, 
this is obviously a moment of crisis in 
American education. Kids have been 
distance learning or in and out of class-
room settings for the last year. We 
have had so many children fall behind, 
especially those with learning needs. 
We have a lot of kids in crisis. For a lot 
of kids, home is not a safe place. There 
is trauma today amongst America’s 
children, and our education system is 
going to have to bear a lot of the brunt 
of making sure that these kids are 
taken care of. 
We have a crisis in higher education 
without students in the classroom, 
without sources of revenue flowing into 
institutions of higher learning. We 
need to make sure that we don’t lose 
classroom slots in colleges and univer-
sities, which, of course, is the only 
thing that allows us to be able to see a 
bright economic future for our coun-
try—expanding access to higher edu-
cation. 
Miguel is made for this moment be-
cause he knows how important college 
is. He was the first member of his fam-
ily to complete college. He knows how 
important community is. He came 
right back to his community of Meri-
den after completing college and went 
to work serving his community by tak-
ing a job teaching fourth grade in Meri-
den. 
He proved early on that he would go 
above and beyond the call when it 
came to the needs of his students. He 
was a teacher at Israel Putnam Ele-
mentary School, room 160. If his kids 
didn’t have what they needed, Miguel 
would reach into his pockets to make 
sure they had it. One year, he spent 
$450 of his own money—money that he 
probably didn’t have as a first- or sec-
ond-year teacher—to make sure every 
kid in his classroom had a notebook, a 
writer’s handbook, and a box of cray-
ons. One student told the story of a 
classmate who moved back to Puerto 
Rico and of Miguel’s organizing a pack-
et of letters from all of his classmates 
to be sent to him so that he could still 
have a connection back to Meriden. 
He was such an amazing teacher that 
he was promoted just after a few years 
in the classroom. He was actually Con-
necticut’s youngest principal when, at 
age 28, he took over Hanover. Soon 
thereafter, he was promoted to help 
run the city’s school district, and he 
was promoted again to be the commis-
sioner of education in Connecticut. 
It has been his work over the last 
year that, I think, caught the atten-
tion of educational policy leaders and 
advocates all across the country be-
cause Connecticut was one of the first 
States to reopen its schools. We did it 
through a consensus-building exercise 
that Commissioner Cardona led. He 
brought together students and parents, 
administrators, teachers, and teachers 
unions to come up with a plan to safely 
reopen our schools. Connecticut re-
opened our schools faster than many 
people thought we could, ahead of the 
curve nationally. He was able to do 
that because consensus building is a 
skill that Miguel Cardona has been 
working on for a very long time. 
In 2013, one of his jobs, while he was 
helping to lead the Meriden school sys-
tem, was to implement a new teacher 
evaluation system. You know this can 
always be very, very controversial, a 
new system evaluating teachers’ per-
formances, but he brought everybody 
to the table and developed a model that 
became used statewide. His model and 
his consensus approach became the 
standard in our State. He is the Sec-
retary of Education we need right 
now—somebody who has experience in 
our classrooms, somebody who knows 
the value of college, especially to first- 
generation college families, and some-
body who knows how to bring people 
together. 
This is an incredibly important mo-
ment for America’s educational sys-
tem. We need to maintain and expand 
our commitment to equity in our K–12 
system to make sure that every single 
kid—no matter the level of income, no 
matter the ethnic background, no mat-
ter the race, no matter if one is dis-
abled or not—gets a quality education. 
This is a moment to invest in ac-
countability in higher education and 
make sure that we are not wasting tax-
payer dollars funding programs and de-
grees that don’t work, that may make 
money for for-profit investors but that 
don’t end up in skill sets that are going 
to power our economy. Miguel Cardona 
is the right person to meet this mo-
ment. He is whip-smart. He is a con-
sensus builder. He is a passionate advo-
cate for kids and for teachers and for 
parents. He is the perfect person for 
this job and for this moment. 
Lastly, let me just share with you 
how I got to know Miguel Cardona, 
which, maybe, will serve as a final ad-
vertisement for his unique qualifica-
tions. This was my old congressional 
district, and Meriden was part and is 
still part of the Fifth Congressional 
District. One of the biggest weekends 
in Meriden has become the Puerto 
Rican Heritage Festival, but that fes-
tival had sort of hit hard times. It was 
a decade ago when, maybe, only a cou-
ple hundred people came to it until the 
Cardona family took it over. Miguel 
Cardona and his family took over the 
Puerto Rican Heritage Festival in 
Meriden, CT. Today, 6,000 or 7,000 peo-
ple come to this festival. You can find 
Miguel Cardona, on that weekend, 
every hour of each day of the festival, 
driving around on his golf cart, orga-
nizing bus transportation, working on 
the entertainment acts, and making 
sure that Meriden is able, on that 
weekend, to be able to celebrate its 
Puerto Rican heritage but then to offer 
something really constructive, really 
fun, and really empowering for the 
community.

FEDERAL FUNDING 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, from the 
streets of Portland and Seattle to right 
here in our Nation’s Capital, lawless-
ness has ensued all too often across our 
Nation over the past year. I have con-
sistently called it what it is—anarchy. 
And, folks, we need to be absolutely 
clear on this: Anarchy cannot be toler-
ated in our Nation. 
The mayhem that we have seen over 
the last year has put our families, our 
communities, and our law enforcement 
in danger, and tragically it has led to 
death and destruction. 
In what will probably come as no 
shock to the American people, a non-
partisan watchdog organization found 
that the Federal Government has spent 
more than $14 billion of our taxpayer 
money, our hard-earned dollars, on 
Federal contracts and grants in five 
major cities where civil unrest, also 
known as anarchy, goes unchecked and 
police are unable to do their jobs—14

billion with a ‘‘b’’ dollars paid to local 
leaders and city officials who are fail-
ing to do their jobs. 
Let’s keep talking about these dollar 
figures, folks. According to recent re-
ports by local media in Oregon, left-
wing protests in Portland have caused 
roughly $2.3 million in damage to Fed-
eral buildings since they broke out last 
summer. The near-nightly standoffs 
with police involved graffiti, broken 
windows, firecrackers, as well as Molo-
tov cocktails. According to one U.S. at-
torney in Oregon, cleanup at the court-
house and four other government build-
ings has cost more than $2 million, and 
that number could keep going up be-
cause the repairs are ongoing. 
Last year, I pushed for a review of 
any Federal funding that was going to 
the cities and States that were allow-
ing anarchy to run rampant. It was a 
simple ask: Scrutinize any future Fed-
eral funding that might flow into these 
lawless jurisdictions. 
Specifically, I asked the Office of 
Management and Budget to look into 
and report to the American people the 
amount of taxpayer dollars local offi-
cials used to either sustain these au-
tonomous zones or the amount needed 
to repair the damage done during the 
chaos. Thankfully, last year, the Fed-
eral Government began to do just that, 
but, folks, just last week, President 
Biden reversed this effort, and I would 
like to know why. 
I agree with our new President that 
peaceful protests are a cornerstone of 
our democracy, but smashing windows 
is not protesting and neither is looting. 
Burning small businesses that are the 
modest nest eggs of hard-working 
Americans and actions like those are 
totally unacceptable. I don’t think 
there is anyone in the Senate who 
would disagree. So why, then, is Presi-
dent Biden reversing course and pre-
venting this review from going forward 
to simply examine the funds that are 
going to the very places where lawless-
ness continues to be unanswered? 
Too often over the last year, local 
leaders have prevented law enforce-
ment and emergency responders from 
being allowed to carry out their jobs 
and protect the public. Yet millions of 
our taxpayer dollars have still been 
doled out to these cities. 
I will continue to stand strong and be 
a voice for the hard-working taxpayers 
of this country. If city and State lead-
ers abdicate their job to protect citi-
zens and allow anarchist jurisdictions 
to prevail, the Federal Government and 
Iowa taxpayers should absolutely not 
foot the bill. Anarchy is never OK— 
never OK—and taxpayers should never 
subsidize it. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

f 
TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINA NOLAN 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would 
like 
to 
pay 
tribute 
to 
a 
great 
Vermonter, Christina Nolan, a most 
dedicated 
public 
servant 
who 
has 
served as U.S. attorney for the District 
of Vermont since November 2017. She 
will be resigning her post at the end of 
this month, 11 years since she first 
joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office, but 
her work and the strong partnerships 
she forged will carry on for many years 
to come. 
A profile of Christina recently ap-
peared in Vermont Business Magazine 
under the headline ‘‘A Born Advocate 
for Justice.’’ And she has been just 
that. During her tenure, Christina 
worked to stem the deadly surge of 
heroin and fentanyl in our small State, 
and she has joined with Federal part-
ners to slow the illegal trafficking of 
firearms. She has also used her voice to 
shine a spotlight on domestic violence 
and human trafficking, not only pros-
ecuting critical cases but also high-
lighting the plight of victims who are 
caught in the path of such heinous 
crimes. Her personal approach to each 
and every case, signing off on every 
charging document in the office, as 
well as her commitment to victims and 
her dedication to upholding the rule of 
law are evident to anyone who has wit-
nessed her work and her work ethic. 
While Vermont’s U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice is among the smallest in the coun-
try, it is fair to say that under 
Christina’s leadership, the team has 
punched well above their weight. In 
one instance, her office set out to in-
vestigate kickbacks and fraudulent 
billing practices involving the elec-
tronic health records industry, unrav-
eling a scheme that resulted in an $8 
billion 
national 
settlement 
with 
Perdue Pharma, which admitted to 
needlessly and shamelessly promoting 
the prescribed use of OxyContin, a 
highly addictive opioid. 
During her time as U.S. attorney, 
Christina has forged strong relation-
ships with her partners in Federal, 
State and local law enforcement cir-
cles, many of whom have shared with 
me how much they appreciated her en-
gagement. 
In 
the 
courtroom, 
col-
leagues on both sides of the bench have 
lauded her fairness. A Federal judge, 
interviewed for the aforementioned 
magazine profile, spoke of her ‘‘quiet 
confidence’’ and her ‘‘natural court-
room 
presence: 
graceful 
and 
com-
manding.’’ 
I am proud to have worked with Gov. 
Phil Scott to recommend Christina 
Nolan for the position of U.S. attorney 
back 
in 
2017. 
She 
has 
served 
Vermonters very well during her ten-
ure. Marcelle and I wish Christina and 
her longtime partner, Jill, and their 
family our very best in future endeav-
ors. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, just 
barely a year ago, I was here making a 
similar statement. Impeachment is one 
of the most solemn matters to come 
before the Senate, but I worry that it’s 
also becoming a common occurrence. 
Before getting into the merits of this 
impeachment, it is important to reit-
erate that January 6 was a sad and 
tragic day for America. I hope we can 
all agree about that. 
What happened here at the Capitol 
was completely inexcusable. It was not 
a demonstration of any of our pro-
tected, inalienable rights. It was a di-
rect, violent attack on our seat of gov-
ernment. Those who plowed over police 
barricades, assaulted law enforcement, 
and desecrated our monument to rep-
resentative democracy flouted the rule 
of law and disgraced our Nation. Six 
people, including two U.S. Capitol Po-
lice officers, now lie dead in the wake 
of this assault. The perpetrators must 
be brought to justice, and I am glad to 
see that many such cases are pro-
gressing around the country. 
While the ultimate responsibility for 
this attack rests upon the shoulders of 
those who unlawfully entered the Cap-
itol, everyone involved must take re-
sponsibility for their destructive ac-
tions that day, including the former 
President. As the leader of the Nation, 
all Presidents bear some responsibility 
for the actions that they inspire—good 
or bad. Undoubtedly, then-President 
Trump displayed poor leadership in his 
words and actions. I do not defend 
those actions and my vote should not 
be read as a defense of those actions. 
I am a member of a Court of Im-
peachment. My job is to vote on the 
case brought by the House managers. I 
took an oath to render judgment on 
the Article of Impeachment sent to the 
Senate by the House of Representa-
tives. We are confined to considering 
only the Articles charged and the facts 
presented. 
First and foremost, I don’t think this 
impeachment is proper under the Con-
stitution. This is the first time the 
Senate has tried a former President. 
Whether or not it can do so is a dif-
ficult 
question. 
The 
Constitution 
doesn’t say in black and white ‘‘Yes, 
the Senate can try a former President’’ 
or ‘‘No, it can’t.’’ In contrast, many 
State constitutions at the time of the 
founding specified that their legisla-
tures could, so it’s notable that our 
Federal charter did not. In order to an-
swer this question it’s therefore nec-
essary to look at the text, structure, 
and history of the Constitution. That’s 
what I have done. In the end, I do not 
think we have the ability to try a 
former President. 
I start always with the Constitution, 
which gives Congress the power of im-
peachment. As I mentioned, impeach-
ment was a feature in many State con-
stitutions at the time, and it came 
from a power enjoyed by the English 
Parliament. 
Impeachment in England was a pow-
erful tool whereby Parliament could

hold individuals accountable for ac-
tions against the government without 
having to rely on the King to enforce 
it. It applied not just to sitting govern-
ment officials but also to former gov-
ernment officials and even to private 
individuals. It was not simply a way to 
remove government officials but a gen-
eral method of punishing the enemies 
of Parliament, including with fines, 
jail time, or even death. 
This is not the system established by 
our Constitution. Our Constitution re-
stricts the power of impeachment in 
two important ways. First, it says that 
Congress can’t just impeach anyone: 
only the President, the Vice President, 
and ‘‘all civil Officers of the United 
States’’ can be impeached. It then re-
stricts the penalties for impeachment 
to removal from office and disqualifica-
tion. 
A former President is not in any of 
those three categories. He is not the 
President. In fact, the Constitution 
also specifies that when the President 
is impeached, the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court shall preside over the 
trial. Chief Justice Roberts has not 
presided over this trial, thus making it 
clear that it is not the trial of a Presi-
dent. He is obviously not the Vice 
President. He is not a civil officer of 
the United States. 
Because he does not fall into any of 
these categories, I don’t think that 
this trial was appropriate. 
Moving beyond the text of the Con-
stitution, the history of the Senate 
confirms this. The U.S. Senate has 
never convicted a former official in an 
impeachment. The Senate has tried 
three individuals who were former offi-
cers—William Blount a former Senator 
in 1798; William Belknap a former Sec-
retary of War, in 1876; and Robert Ar-
chibald an incumbent Commerce Court 
judge, in 1912, tried as well for conduct 
while a district judge). Belknap is the 
only executive branch member tried 
after leaving office. None was con-
victed for his prior conduct, Archibald 
was convicted on counts relating to his 
incumbent judicial service on the Com-
merce Court. In all three cases, the ju-
risdictional question loomed large at 
the trial and was cited as an important 
argument justifying the acquittals. In 
other words, Senate practice is con-
sistent: It has never convicted a former 
official in an impeachment. 
Between the text of the Constitution 
and the consistent practice of the Sen-
ate, I’m convinced that this is not an 
appropriate use of our power. While I 
realize there are arguments on the 
other side from learned scholars, to 
me, they do not overcome these prob-
lems of text and history. 
That’s why I voted twice to deal with 
this impeachment on jurisdictional 
grounds. But my position didn’t pre-
vail, with the majority Democrats vot-
ing in lockstep to proceed, and we went 
to trial. As I’ve said, even though I 
think this is inappropriate, I kept an 
open mind during the process, and I lis-
tened to both sides as they presented 
their evidence. 
The House managers tried to prove 
that President Trump incited an insur-
rection. That is a difficult argument to 
make. There were many other Articles 
over which they could have impeached 
President Trump, but this is what the 
House of Representatives chose. They 
didn’t meet their burden. 
Before getting to the merits of the 
charge, I need to point out that this 
impeachment trial has not aligned 
with principles of due process of law. 
Other impeachments have involved sig-
nificant fact-finding in the House, 
where proper legal formalities are fol-
lowed, witnesses are heard from and 
cross-examined, and hard evidence is 
reviewed. Here there were no hearings 
in the House. The evidence presented 
was mostly video montages and news 
reports. We even had the unusual spec-
tacle of voting to call witnesses for the 
first time as the trial was ending only 
to immediately reverse course and call 
none. Given the seriousness of the situ-
ation, I think we should expect better 
when the House exercises its constitu-
tional duty of impeachment. 
This issue involves complicated legal 
questions. In our legal system, though, 
it is very difficult for speech to rise to 
the level of incitement. ‘‘Incitement’’ 
is a legal term of art. Usually it takes 
place in the context of incitement to 
violence. Incitement, in our legal sys-
tem, doesn’t mean ‘‘encouraging’’ vio-
lence or ‘‘advocating’’ violence or even 
‘‘espousing’’ violence. It means inten-
tionally causing likely violence. Be-
cause the Article of Impeachment uses 
the word ‘‘incitement,’’ I need to evalu-
ate President Trump’s actions under 
the rubrics of the law of incitement, 
which were set out in the Supreme 
Court case of Brandenburg v. Ohio. In 
that case the Court held that incite-
ment required speech that, first, en-
courages ‘‘imminent lawless action’’ 
and, second, ‘‘is likely to incite or 
produce such action.’’ In other words, 
in order to succeed, the House man-
agers must have shown that President 
Trump’s speech was intended to direct 
the crowd to assault the Capitol and 
that his language was also likely to 
have that effect. 
As I said before, what happened on 
January 6 was tragic. We can’t let it 
happen again. But the House managers 
have not sufficiently demonstrated 
that President Trump’s speech incited 
it. While I will have more to say about 
President Trump’s conduct, the fact is 
that he said this: ‘‘I know that every-
one here will soon be marching over to 
the Capitol building to peacefully and 
patriotically make your voices heard.’’ 
That speech is not an incitement to 
immanent lawless action as established 
in the case law. I wish the crowd would 
have listened to him. 
Just because President Trump did 
not meet the definition of inciting in-
surrection does not mean that I think 
he behaved well. 
To be clear, I wanted President 
Trump to win in November. I gave over 
30 speeches on his behalf in Iowa the 
week before the election. He, like any 
politician, is entitled to seek redress in 
the courts to resolve election disputes. 
President Trump did just that, and 
there’s nothing wrong with it. I sup-
ported the exercise of this right in the 
hopes that allowing the election chal-
lenge process to play out would remove 
all doubt about the outcome. The re-
ality is, he lost. He brought over 60 
lawsuits and lost all but 1 of them. He 
was not able to challenge enough votes 
to overcome President Biden’s signifi-
cant margins in key States. I wish it 
would have stopped there. 
It didn’t. President Trump continued 
to argue that the election had been sto-
len even though the courts didn’t back 
up his claims. He belittled and har-
assed elected officials across the coun-
try to get his way. He encouraged his 
own, loyal Vice President, Mike Pence, 
to take extraordinary and unconstitu-
tional actions during the electoral col-
lege count. My vote in this impeach-
ment does nothing to excuse or justify 
those actions. There’s no doubt in my 
mind that President Trump’s language 
was extreme, aggressive, and irrespon-
sible. 
Unfortunately, 
others 
share 
the 
blame in polluting our political dis-
course with inflammatory and divisive 
language. As President Trump’s attor-
neys showed, whatever we heard from 
President Trump, we had been hearing 
from Democrats for years. National 
Democrats, up to and including Presi-
dent Biden and Vice President Harris, 
have become regular purveyors of 
speech dismissing and even condoning 
violence. It’s not surprising that when 
they talk about taking the ‘‘fight’’ to 
‘‘the streets’’ organizations like antifa 
actually take to the streets of our cit-
ies with shields and bats and fists, de-
stroying lives and livelihoods. 
Yes, I think President Trump should 
have accepted President Biden’s vic-
tory when it became clear he won. I 
think Secretary Clinton should have 
done the same thing in 2016. But as re-
cently as 2019, she questioned the legit-
imacy of Trump’s election, saying 
‘‘[Trump] knows he’s an illegitimate 
president. I believe he understands that 
the many varying tactics they used, 
from voter suppression and voter purg-
ing to hacking to the false stories . . . 
there were just a bunch of different 
reasons why the election turned out 
like it did.’’ 
If there’s one lesson I hope we all 
learn from not only last year but the 
last few years, it’s that we all need to 
tone down the rhetoric. Whether it’s 
the destructive riots we saw last sum-
mer or the assault on the Capitol, too 
many people think that politics really 
is just war by another name. To far too 
many people, our democracy isn’t free 
people coming together to make life 
better for our communities. It’s a 
street fight. 
We don’t need to agree on every-
thing. In fact, part of what makes our 
democracy great is that we don’t agree 
on everything. But we do need to re-
solve these differences with debate and

with 
elections, 
not 
with 
violence. 
Whether the violence comes from the 
left or the right, it’s wrong. The same 
goes for speech that claims to define 
enemies by political views or affili-
ations. 
We’re all Americans, always trying 
to form a more perfect union. We have 
more in common than what divides us. 
It’s high time those of us who have 
been elected to serve lead by example. 
We can take the high road. We can tone 
down the rhetoric. We can be respectful 
even when we disagree strongly. If we 
don’t, we’ll be betraying the trust that 
the American people have placed in us, 
and we’ll endanger the democracy and 
the freedom that so many of us have 
worked to preserve. 
These are difficult issues I have con-
sidered over the past week, but in the 
end, I am confident in what I think is 
the correct position. We do not have 
the authority to try a private citizen 
like former President Trump. Even if 
we did, he should have been accorded 
the protections of due process of law in 
his trial. And even if we assume he has 
been, the House managers still did not 
prove that he committed incitement to 
insurrection, the specific crime of 
which he stands accused. This does not 
excuse President Trump’s conduct on 
and around January 6 of this year, it 
satisfies my oath as a U.S. Senator in 
this Court of Impeachment. I therefore 
voted to acquit. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent to have my opinion 
memorandum in the impeachment trial 
of President Donald J. Trump be print-
ed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
OPINION
MEMORANDUM
OF
UNITED
STATES 
SENATOR JOHN F. REED
IN
THE IMPEACH-
MENT TRIAL
OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN 
TRUMP 
I. FINDINGS 
On January 13, 2021, the United States 
House of Representatives passed House Reso-
lution 24,1 ‘‘Impeaching Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States, for high 
crimes and misdemeanors.’’ 
Based on the evidence in the record, the ar-
guments of the House Impeachment Man-
agers, and the arguments of President’s 
Counsel, I conclude as follows: Mr. Trump 
has violated his oath to take care that the 
laws be faithfully executed and has acted in 
a manner that is fundamentally incompat-
ible with the constitutional order. The House 
Impeachment Managers have proven that 
Mr. Trump’s incitement of insurrection 
amounts to the constitutional standard of 
‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ for which 
the remedy of conviction and disqualifica-
tion is warranted. 
II. THE CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS FOR 
IMPEACHMENT 
‘‘The Senate shall have the sole Power to 
try all Impeachments.’’ 2
With these few 
words, the Framers of the Constitution en-
trusted the Senate with the most awesome 
power within a democratic society: whether 
to remove an impeached president from of-
fice. 
A. High Crimes and Misdemeanors 
The Constitution states, ‘‘The President, 
Vice President and all civil Officers of the 
United States, shall be removed from Office 
on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, 
Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors.’’ 3 
‘‘Treason’’ and ‘‘Bribery’’ are foundational 
impeachable offenses. No more heinous ex-
ample of an offense against the constitu-
tional order exists than betrayal of the na-
tion to an enemy or betrayal of duty for per-
sonal enrichment. A President commits trea-
son when he levies war against the United 
States or gives comfort or aid to its en-
emies.4 As the House Judiciary Committee 
explained, a President engages in impeach-
able bribery when he ‘‘offers, solicits, or ac-
cepts something of personal value to influ-
ence his own official actions.’’ 5 
In interpreting ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors,’’ we must not only look to the 
Federalist Papers and the records of the Con-
stitutional Convention, but also to the con-
temporary and foundational writings on Im-
peachment available to the Framers. 
Sir William Blackstone, whose influential 
Commentaries on the Laws of England were 
published from 1765–1770, discussed a classi-
fication of crimes he termed ‘‘public wrongs, 
or crimes and misdemeanors’’ that he de-
fined as breaches of the public duty an indi-
vidual owed to their entire community.6 
Blackstone viewed treason, murder, and rob-
bery as ‘‘public wrongs,’’ not only because 
they cause injury to individuals but also be-
cause they ‘‘strike at the very being of soci-
ety. ’’ 7 
Richard Wooddeson, a legal scholar who 
began giving lectures on English law in 1777, 
defined impeachable offenses as misdeeds 
that fail to clearly fall under the jurisdiction 
of ordinary tribunals. These wrongs were 
‘‘abuse[s] of high offices of trust’’ that dam-
aged the commonwealth.8 
Much 
the 
same 
as 
Blackstone 
and 
Wooddeson, Alexander Hamilton included 
the dual components of abuse of public trust 
and national harm in his definition of im-
peachable crimes and misdemeanors. In Fed-
eralist Paper No. 65, Hamilton defined an im-
peachable offense as ‘‘those offenses which 
proceed from the misconduct of public men, 
or in other words from the abuse or violation 
of some public trust. They are of a nature 
which may with peculiar propriety be de-
nominated POLITICAL, as they relate chief-
ly to injuries done immediately to the soci-
ety itself.’’ 9 
B. The Constitutional Debates 
Adding impressive support to these con-
sistent views of the meaning of the constitu-
tional 
term, 
‘‘high 
Crimes 
and 
Mis-
demeanors,’’ is the history of the delibera-
tions at the Constitutional Convention. 
The convention delegates considered lim-
iting Impeachment to treason and bribery. 
However, they concluded that these enumer-
ated offenses alone could not anticipate 
every manner of profound misconduct that a 
future president might engage in.10 George 
Mason, a delegate from Virginia, declared 
that ‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors’’ would 
be an apt way to further capture ‘‘great and 
dangerous offences’’ or ‘‘[a]ttempts to sub-
vert the Constitution.’’ 11 
This wording would also set the nec-
essarily high threshold for Impeachment 
that would be proportional to the severe 
punishment of removing an elected official 
and disqualification from holding future pub-
lic office. Further insight is provided by 
James Iredell, a delegate to the North Caro-
lina Convention that ratified the Constitu-
tion, who later served as a Justice of the 
United States Supreme Court. During the 
Convention debates, Iredell stated: 
The power of impeachment is given by this 
Constitution, to bring great offenders to 
punishment . . . This power is lodged in 
those who represent the great body of the 
people, because the occasion for its exercise 
will arise from acts of great injury to the 
community, and the objects of it may be 
such as cannot be easily reached by an ordi-
nary tribunal.12 
Iredell’s understanding sustains the view 
that an impeachable offense must cause 
‘‘great injury to the community.’’ Private 
wrongdoing, without a significant, adverse 
effect upon the nation, cannot constitute an 
impeachable offense. James Wilson, a dele-
gate to the Federal Constitutional Conven-
tion and, like Iredell, later a Supreme Court 
Justice, wrote that Impeachments are ‘‘pro-
ceedings of a political nature . . . confined to 
political characters, to political crimes and 
misdemeanors, 
and 
to 
political 
punish-
ments.’’ 13 
Later 
commentators 
expressed 
similar 
views. In 1833, Justice Joseph Story quoted 
favorably from the scholarship of William 
Rawle, who concluded that the ‘‘legitimate 
causes of impeachment . . . can have ref-
erence only to public character, and official 
duty . . . In general, those offenses, which 
may be committed equally by a private per-
son, as a public officer, are not the subject of 
impeachment.’’ 14 
This line of reasoning is buttressed by the 
careful and thoughtful work of the House of 
Representatives during the Watergate pro-
ceedings. The Democratic staff of the House 
Judiciary 
Committee 
concluded 
that, 
‘‘[b]ecause impeachment of a President is a 
grave step for the nation, it is to be predi-
cated only upon conduct seriously incompat-
ible with either the constitutional form and 
principles of our government or the proper 
performance of constitutional duties of the 
presidential office.’’ 15 
The deliberations at the Constitutional 
Convention also demonstrate a conscious 
movement to narrow the terminology as a 
means of raising the threshold for the Im-
peachment process to require an offense 
against the State. 
Early in the debate on the issue of presi-
dential Impeachment in July of 1787, it was 
suggested that Impeachment and removal 
could be founded on a showing of ‘‘mal-
practice,’’ ‘‘neglect of duty,’’ or ‘‘corrup-
tion.’’ 16 By September of 1787, the issue of 
presidential Impeachment had been referred 
to the Committee of Eleven, which was cre-
ated to resolve the most contentious issues. 
The 
Committee 
of 
Eleven 
considered 
whether 
the 
grounds 
for 
Impeachment 
should be ‘‘treason or bribery.’’ 17 This was 
significantly more restricted than the amor-
phous standard of ‘‘malpractice,’’ too re-
stricted, in fact, for some delegates. George 
Mason objected and suggested that ‘‘mal-
administration’’ be added to ‘‘treason and 
bribery.’’ 18 James Madison opposed this sug-
gestion as being ‘‘equivalent to a tenure dur-
ing pleasure of the Senate.’’ 19 Mason re-
sponded by further refining his suggestion 
and offered the term ‘‘other high crimes and 
misdemeanors against the State.’’ 20
The 
Mason language was a clear reference to the 
English legal history of Impeachment. Ma-
son’s proposal explicitly narrowed these of-
fenses to those ‘‘against the State.’’ The 
Convention itself further clarified the stand-
ard by replacing ‘‘State’’ with the ‘‘United 
States.’’ 21 
At the conclusion of the substantive delib-
erations on the constitutional standard of 
Impeachment, it was obvious that only seri-
ous offenses against the governmental sys-
tem would justify Impeachment and subse-
quent removal from office. However, the 
Committee of Style applied the final sty-
listic touches to the Constitution. This Com-
mittee had no authority to alter the mean-
ing of the carefully debated language and

could only impose a stylistic consistency 
through, among other things, the elimi-
nation of redundancy. In its zeal to stream-
line the text, the words ‘‘against the United 
States’’ were eliminated as unnecessary to 
the meaning of the passage.22 
The weight of both authoritative com-
mentary and the history of the Constitu-
tional Convention combines to provide con-
vincing proof that the Impeachment process 
was reserved for serious breaches of the con-
stitutional order that threaten the country 
in a direct and immediate manner. 
C. An Impeachable Offense is Not Limited to 
Criminal Liability or a Defined Offense 
Article I, Section 3 of the United States 
Constitution provides that ‘‘Judgment in 
Cases of Impeachment shall not extend fur-
ther than to removal from Office, and dis-
qualification to hold and enjoy any Office of 
honor, Trust or Profit under the United 
States: but the Party convicted shall never-
theless be liable and subject to Indictment, 
Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according 
to Law.’’ 23 As Delegate James Wilson wrote, 
‘‘impeachments, and offenses and offenders 
impeachable [do not come] within the sphere 
of ordinary jurisprudence. They are founded 
on different principles, are governed by dif-
ferent maxims, and are directed to different 
objects: for this reason, the trial and punish-
ment of an offense on an impeachment, is no 
bar to a trial and punishment of the same of-
fence at common law.’’ 24 The independence 
of the Impeachment process from the pros-
ecution of crimes underscores the function of 
Impeachment as a means to remove a presi-
dent from office, not only because of crimi-
nal behavior, but because the president poses 
a threat to the constitutional order. Crimi-
nal behavior is not irrelevant to an Impeach-
ment, but it only becomes decisive if that be-
havior imperils the balance of powers estab-
lished in the Constitution. 
The assertion that an impeachable offense 
must be predicated on a criminal act goes 
against the well-established consensus of the 
legal community. For example, Mr. Trump’s 
former Attorney General, William Barr, 
wrote in a 2018 memo to the Department of 
Justice (DOJ) when he was still in private 
practice, that the President ‘‘is answerable 
for any abuses of discretion and is ulti-
mately subject to the judgment of Congress 
through the impeachment process [which] 
means that the president is not the judge in 
his own cause.’’ 25 As Mr. Barr makes clear, 
Impeachment does not need to be based on a 
crime. 
Furthermore, any assertion that an im-
peachable offense must involve the violation 
of an ‘‘already known or established’’ law, 
even if not criminal, is not supported by the 
constitutional record. In advocating for the 
inclusion of Impeachment at the Constitu-
tional Convention, James Madison made the 
case that the country must be protected 
against any number of abuses that a presi-
dent could engage in and which might cause 
permanent damage to the country. Madison 
wrote that: 
[It was] indispensable that some provision 
should be made for defending the Commu-
nity [against] the incapacity, negligence or 
perfidy of the chief Magistrate. The limita-
tion of the period of his service, was not a 
sufficient security[. . .] He might pervert his 
administration into a scheme of peculation 
or oppression. He might betray his trust to 
foreign powers.26 
Confining Impeachment to criminal or 
even codified offenses goes against the main-
stream consensus on the meaning of ‘‘high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ and would fail to 
capture the universe of harms to the con-
stitutional order in which a President could 
engage. 
D. Conclusion 
Authoritative commentary on, together 
with the structure of, the Constitution 
makes it clear that the term, ‘‘other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors,’’ encompasses 
conduct that involves the president in the 
impermissible exercise of the powers of his 
office to upset the constitutional order. 
Moreover, since the essence of Impeachment 
is removal from office, rather than punish-
ment for offenses, there is a strong inference 
that the improper conduct must represent a 
continuing threat to the American people 
and the Constitution. 
IV. STANDARD OF PROOF 
In an Impeachment trial, each Senator has 
the obligation to establish the burden of 
proof he or she deems proper.27 The Founding 
Fathers believed maximum discretion was 
critical for Senators confronting the gravest 
of constitutional choices.28
Differentiating 
Impeachment from criminal trials, Alex-
ander Hamilton argued, in Federalist Paper 
No. 65, that Impeachments ‘‘can never be 
tied down by such strict rules . . . as in com-
mon cases serve to limit the discretion of 
courts in favor of personal security.’’ 29 In 
this regard, Hamilton further distinguished 
Impeachment proceedings from a criminal 
trial by stressing that an impeached official 
would be subject to the established rules of 
criminal prosecution after Impeachment.30 
However, what exact constitutional stand-
ard should be used remains debatable. Prac-
tical concerns related to utilizing the Im-
peachment power should be considered when 
determining the standard of proof required. 
Too low of a standard may lead to removal, 
even if significant doubts exist. A ‘‘. . . high 
‘criminal’ standard of proof could mean, in 
practice, that a man could remain president 
whom every member of the Senate believed 
to be guilty of corruption, just because his 
guilt was not shown ‘beyond a reasonable 
doubt.’ ’’ 31 
When uncertain about the standard of 
proof to apply, it is worth reviewing the 
writings of eminent scholars. In doing so, I 
have found a closer approximation to what 
the standard should be in many Impeach-
ment trials as compared to those used in 
general legal practice: ‘‘ ‘[o]verwhelming pre-
ponderance of the evidence’ . . .’’ 32 Yet, I be-
lieve that the severity of removing a presi-
dent of the United States warrants an even 
higher bar. As such, a definition slightly 
modified, but modeled on that proposed 
standard, is more applicable: overwhelm-
ingly clear and convincing evidence. This 
standard more closely comports with histor-
ical analysis of the Founders’ desire to sepa-
rate criminal law and Impeachment and the 
arguments made by scholars, while reflect-
ing the serious constitutional harms alleged 
in the Article of Impeachment before the 
Senate. 
V. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
The President’s Counsel has argued that an 
Impeachment trial conducted after a presi-
dent leaves office is unconstitutional. Spe-
cifically, they write, in their trial brief, ‘‘It 
is denied that the quoted provision [Article 
I, Section 4] currently applies to the 45th 
President of the United States since he is no 
longer ‘President’.’’ 33 The President’s Coun-
sel hinge their argument on the wording of 
Article II, Section 4, which reads, ‘‘The 
President, Vice President and all Civil Offi-
cers of the United States, shall be removed 
from Office on Impeachment for, and Convic-
tion of, Treason, Bribery, or other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ The President’s 
Counsel argue that since Mr. Trump is no 
longer the president, 
‘‘[T]he clause ‘shall be removed from Office 
on Impeachment for . . .’ is impossible for 
the Senate to accomplish, and thus the cur-
rent proceeding before the Senate is void ab 
initio as a legal nullity that runs patently 
contrary to the plain language of the Con-
stitution . . . Since removal from office by 
the Senate of the President is a condition 
precedent which must occur before, and 
jointly with, ‘disqualification’ to hold future 
office, the fact that the Senate presently is 
unable to remove from office the 45th Presi-
dent whose term has expired, means that 
Averment 1 is therefore irrelevant to any 
matter before the Senate.’’ 34 
Such logic ignores the historical context in 
which the Impeachment power was drafted, 
willfully misinterprets the language of the 
Constitution, rejects the precedent set by 
previous Senates, and promotes the dan-
gerous concept of a ‘‘January Exception.’’ 35 
Impeachment was not a revolutionary con-
cept at the time the U.S. Constitution was 
drafted. The concept had long been part of 
English political custom, which framed 
much of the Founder’s understanding of gov-
ernment.36 Indeed, Alexander Hamilton ex-
plicitly stated in Federalist No. 65 that the 
Impeachment power was borrowed from 
English political history.37 Thus, we can un-
derstand the bounds of the Impeachment 
power from precedents set in English polit-
ical history. Two examples from the 18th 
century 
are 
illustrative 
of 
the 
impeachability of former officials. First, 
‘‘[i]n 
1725, 
former 
Lord 
Chancellor 
Macclesfield was impeached and convicted 
for acts of bribery committed during his ten-
ure in office.’’ 38 Second, at the time of the 
Philadelphia Convention, Parliament was 
preparing to conduct an Impeachment trial 
against Warren Hastings, the former Gov-
ernor General of Bengal. These proceedings 
commenced after Hastings had retired from 
his office. ‘‘The Framers were acutely aware 
of the Hastings proceeding, with George 
Mason raising it as an example during debate 
on the Impeachment clauses.’’ 39 If the Fram-
ers had misgivings about Impeachment of 
former officials, a concept that would have 
been on the public mind given Mr. Hastings’ 
impending Impeachment trial, surely they 
would have clarified the wording of the Im-
peachment power in the U.S. Constitution. 
The practice of impeaching former officers 
was also common in the early state govern-
ments. ‘‘Between 1776 and 1787, 10 of the 
newly independent states adopted constitu-
tions that included impeachment provisions. 
Five specifically permitted late Impeach-
ment; no state explicitly forbade it.’’ 40 More-
over, some state constitutions only allowed 
the Impeachment of former officials, mean-
ing that future disqualification from office 
was central to the very purpose of Impeach-
ment.41 For example, Thomas Jefferson un-
derwent an Impeachment inquiry in 1781 
after his tenure as governor ended.42 What 
purpose could such a late inquiry have ex-
cept to attempt to disqualify a former offi-
cial from holding office again in the future? 
The influence of the early state constitu-
tions on the drafting of the U.S. Constitu-
tion is widely accepted. This influence no 
doubt extended to the Framer’s under-
standing of the Impeachment power as in-
cluding former officials.43 
Indeed, the language of the U.S. Constitu-
tion proves this out. Article I, Section 3, 
Clause 6 states, ‘‘The Senate shall have the 
sole Power to try all Impeachments.’’ That 
is, the Senate has the power to conduct a 
trial for any Impeachment commenced by 
the House of Representatives without quali-
fication regarding its timing. The House im-
peached Mr. Trump, and it is now in the con-
stitutional power of the Senate to conduct 
an Impeachment trial. Article I further out-
lines two possible penalties in any Impeach-
ment trial: removal and disqualification.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S928 
March 1, 2021 
The Senate cannot exceed these penalties, 
nor are these penalties necessarily linked by 
the language of the text. The Senate has the 
power to remove a president without also 
disqualifying him or her from future office. 
Likewise, legal scholars assert that disquali-
fication from office need not follow removal 
from office.44 Such a reading would neuter 
the ability of the Senate to disqualify offi-
cials from future office upon their resigna-
tion. Hence, an official accused of crimes 
against the political order could simply re-
sign to avoid punishment and potentially re-
take office in the future. The Framers under-
stood that the power of a demagogic presi-
dent extends beyond his tenure of office. The 
disqualification component of the Impeach-
ment power is the constitutional method for 
addressing this dangerous potentiality, for it 
establishes ‘‘a perpetual ostracism from the 
esteem and confidence, and honors and 
emoluments of his country.’’ 45 
In accordance with English political his-
tory, the early state constitutions, and the 
clear language of the U.S. Constitution, the 
Senate has repeatedly asserted its right to 
conduct an Impeachment trial of former gov-
ernment officials. The first Impeachment 
trial concerned Senator William Blount of 
Tennessee on the charge of conspiracy. After 
the Senate expelled Blount from the body in 
July of 1797, the House brought five articles 
of Impeachment against the former senator 
in January of 1798 with the intention of dis-
qualifying him from holding office in the fu-
ture.46 Most scholars agree that the Senate 
dismissed the case on the grounds that the 
Impeachment power does not extend to 
Members of Congress.47 The Senate did not, 
however, dismiss the case on the basis that 
Blount was a former official.48 The Senate 
once again asserted its right to conduct an 
Impeachment trial of a former official in the 
1876 case of ex-Secretary of War William 
Belknap. The House 
voted 
to 
impeach 
Belknap after he resigned. The Senate then 
debated 
the 
constitutionality 
of 
late 
impeachability before asserting in a 37–29 
vote that it had the power to try an ex-offi-
cer.49 Though Belknap was not ultimately 
convicted, the Senate had decided that it had 
the power to convict and disqualify an ex-of-
ficial. Congress acted once more in the 1926 
case of federal judge George English. The 
House of Representatives chose not to fur-
ther pursue Impeachment after English’s res-
ignation, but the House Managers declared 
‘‘the resignation of Judge English in no way 
affects the right of the Senate, sitting as a 
court of impeachment, to hear and deter-
mine [the case].’’ 50 Several Senators simi-
larly declared the jurisdiction of the Senate 
in the case of Judge English.51 As these cases 
demonstrate, the Senate has repeatedly de-
clared its late-Impeachment powers, though 
it has rarely chosen to purse Impeachment.52 
Finally, the denial of late impeachability 
promotes the dangerous and unconstitu-
tional idea of a ‘‘January Exception.’’ One of 
the central concerns of the Framers was the 
diffusion of power across branches in a sys-
tem of checks and balances to prevent any 
one branch, but particularly the executive, 
from gaining too much power. Impeachment 
is the last line of defense created to hold of-
ficials accountable for their abuse of those 
powers. Hence the time between election and 
inauguration is not a consequence-free pe-
riod for an outgoing president. A president 
who commits an impeachable offense on the 
night before his term ends is still account-
able for those actions when he leaves the 
Oval Office. After his term as president, 
John Quincy Adams proclaimed, ‘‘I hold my-
self, so long as I have the breath of life in my 
body, amendable to impeachment by [the] 
House for everything I did during the time I 
held any public office.’’ 53 The Framers of the 
Constitution did not intend to grant Mr. 
Trump a January reprieve from account-
ability. He must be held accountable for his 
actions during the last weeks of his presi-
dency. 
VI. DUE PROCESS 
The President’s Counsel assert that the 
Impeachment inquiry is defective because of 
a lack of due process protections for Mr. 
Trump. However, the Constitution does not 
provide any guidance about what procedures 
are proscribed in an Impeachment trial. Ar-
ticle II, Section 3 states, ‘‘The Senate shall 
have the sole power to try all Impeach-
ments.’’ 54 Alexander Hamilton provides con-
text to this in Federalist Paper No. 65, say-
ing that Impeachments ‘‘can never be tied 
down by such strict rules . . . as in common 
cases serve to limit the discretion of courts 
in favor of personal security.’’ 55 
Specifically, President’s Counsel asserts 
that the Speaker of the House purposefully 
held onto the Article of Impeachment, 
passed by the House of Representatives, in 
order to ensure that Mr. Trump’s term would 
end before a Senate trial commenced. How-
ever, at the time H. Res. 24 passed, the Sen-
ate was in recess and not scheduled to return 
until January 19th. The Senate Minority 
Leader urged the Senate Majority Leader to 
bring the Senate back into session imme-
diately in order to receive the Article of Im-
peachment. However, the Senate Majority 
Leader rejected this request, meaning that 
even if the House of Representatives had 
tried to send the Article to the Senate imme-
diately after passage, it would not have been 
considered until the Senate was back in ses-
sion.56 
President’s Counsel also assert that the 
House of Representatives did not provide 
proper due process because it did not hold 
hearings on the Article of Impeachment. 
Manager Lieu analogized the present facts to 
a case where crimes are committed in plain 
view, and prosecutors do not have to spend a 
prolonged time investigating before pressing 
charges.57 In this case, the events in ques-
tion—the ‘‘Save America’’ rally, the Elec-
toral Certification, and the ensuing insurrec-
tion—were widely broadcast on television 
and in news publications. Those who took 
part in the attack also documented their 
participation over social media including on 
Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.58 In the 
aftermath of the insurrection, participants 
were arrested and indicted for their unlawful 
and violent actions, and their charging docu-
ments were available to the public.59 
In addition, President’s Counsel, through-
out this case, has conflated the requirements 
of an Impeachment proceeding with that of a 
criminal case, where the Due Process Clause 
of the Fifth Amendment applies. These 
claims are spurious at best. As constitu-
tional scholar Michael Gerhardt stated in re-
gards to Mr. Trump first Impeachment, 
‘‘First, the [Due Process] clause does not 
apply because none of the interests protected 
by the due process clause are being denied 
here—the sanctions are removal and dis-
qualification but not the deprivation of life, 
liberty, or property, which the clause pro-
tects. Second, even if due process applies, it 
has been satisfied here: The minimal require-
ments of due process are an impartial deci-
sion-maker and notice. The president has 
had plenty of notice about the impeachment 
effort, and the Constitution designates sen-
ators as the impartial decision-makers.’’ 60 
‘‘The Supreme Court has explained . . . 
that due process is not a ‘technical concep-
tion with a fixed content unrelated to time, 
place, and circumstances.’ Instead, the con-
cept is ‘flexible and calls for such procedural 
protections as the particular situation de-
mands.’ ’’ 61 In an Impeachment, the obliga-
tion of the Senate is to accord the president, 
as the accused, the right to conduct his de-
fense fairly, while respecting the House of 
Representative’s 
exclusive 
constitutional 
prerogative to bring Articles of Impeach-
ment. At the core of the Senate’s task is the 
fundamental understanding that our system 
of laws recognizes the rights of defendants 
and the responsibilities of the prosecution to 
prove its case. 
Based on the above analysis, I find that 
there is overwhelmingly clear and con-
vincing evidence that Mr. Trump was af-
forded due process in this Impeachment pro-
ceeding. 
VII. INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION 
House Resolution 24 alleges that, in the 
conduct of his office, Mr. Trump incited an 
insurrection, in violation of his constitu-
tional duty to take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed, and in subversion of the 
constitutional order. I find that there is 
overwhelmingly clear and convincing evi-
dence that Mr. Trump committed impeach-
able conduct. As I will further explain, Mr. 
Trump must be convicted and disqualified 
from holding office for the conduct described 
in H. Res. 24. 
A. Legal Standards for Incitement 
As explained in Section III, Congress is 
bound neither by civil nor criminal law in 
determining whether an offense meets the 
standard of ‘‘high Crimes or Misdemeanors.’’ 
However, existing legal frameworks for ‘‘in-
citement’’ are helpful for analyzing and put-
ting Mr. Trump’s words and conduct into 
context. 
Black’s Law Dictionary defines incitement 
generally as ‘‘the act or an instance of pro-
voking, urging on, or stirring up.’’ 62 Specifi-
cally in regards to criminal law, Black’s Law 
Dictionary defines incitement as ‘‘the act of 
persuading another person to commit a 
crime.’’ 63 
A group of constitutional law scholars ex-
plained that, for the purposes of Impeach-
ment, a determination of whether a presi-
dent’s speech or conduct is protected must 
primarily take into account whether a presi-
dent’s words are consistent with the Con-
stitution 64 and the oath to ‘‘faithfully exe-
cute the office of President of the United 
States, and . . . preserve, protect and defend 
the Constitution of the United States.’’ 65 
For example, if a president said ‘‘I no longer 
promise to support and defend the Constitu-
tion of the United States’’ or ‘‘I no longer 
recognize Congress as a co-equal branch of 
government,’’ these statements would cer-
tainly be inherently antithetical to the con-
stitutional order that the president swore to 
uphold. While these statements may be law-
ful and protected by the Constitution in an-
other context, they would certainly be im-
peachable. 
Turning to the definition of ‘‘insurrection’’ 
itself, the Corpus Juris Secundum defines it 
as ‘‘the act of rising in open resistance 
against established authority or govern-
ment, or as any open and active opposition 
of a number of persons to the execution of 
the laws of the United States of so formi-
dable a character as to deny, for the time 
being, the authority of the government, even 
though not accompanied by bloodshed and 
not of sufficient magnitude to render success 
probable.’’ 66 
Based on these sources, I will examine the 
following questions, in order to determine 
whether Mr. Trump incited his supporters to 
commit insurrection, 
(1) What was Mr. Trump’s pattern of 
speech or conduct prior to the January 6th 
‘‘Save America’’ rally? 
(2) Did Mr. Trump foreseeably or recklessly 
solicit his supporters to believe his election 
lies, and know that his supporters would 
take action based on these lies?

(3) Did Mr. Trump’s speech or conduct 
drive his supporters to commit unlawful or 
violent acts on January 6th? 
(4) What steps did Mr. Trump take once the 
rioters had breached the Capitol? 
B. Leading Up to January 6, 2021, Mr. Trump 
Propagated a False Narrative that the Elec-
tion Had Been Stolen and Supported Vio-
lent Rhetoric 
To determine whether Mr. Trump engaged 
in incitement, it is instructive to look at a 
timeline of Mr. Trump’s statements, direct 
acts, and actions taken at his behest, leading 
up to January 6th. 
a. Statements and Conduct Regarding Voter 
Fraud Before the 2020 Election 
Even before the November 2020 election, 
Mr. Trump gave credence to the idea that 
mass voter fraud would be inevitable, and 
the only way he would lose was if the elec-
tion were stolen. For example, in July, Mr. 
Trump tweeted ‘‘With Universal Mail-In Vot-
ing (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 
will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDU-
LENT Election in history.’’ 67 At an August 
rally in Wisconsin, Trump said ‘‘The only 
way we’re going to lose this election is if the 
election is rigged, remember that . . . It’s 
the only way we’re going to lose this elec-
tion. So we have to be very careful.’’ 68 In 
September, he told reporters, from the White 
House lawn, ‘‘I’m not sure that it [the elec-
tion] can be [honest], I don’t know that it 
can be with this whole situation, unsolicited 
ballots, they’re unsolicited, millions being 
sent to everybody.’’ 69 
Before the election took place, Mr. Trump 
also refused to say whether he would accept 
the election results. In a July interview with 
Chris Wallace, when asked directly whether 
he would accept the results of the election, 
Trump said ‘‘Look, you—I have to see. No, 
I’m not going to just say yes.’’ 70 In Sep-
tember, when asked by a reporter if he would 
commit to a peaceful transfer of power, Mr. 
Trump implied that he would not, saying 
‘‘Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very 
peaceful—there won’t be a transfer, frankly. 
There will be a continuation.’’ In the same 
month, when asked by a reporter whether 
the election results would be legitimate only 
if he won, Mr. Trump did not give a direct 
answer, saying, ‘‘So we have to be very care-
ful with the ballots. The ballots—that’s a 
whole big scam.’’ 71 
b. Statements and Conduct Regarding Voter 
Fraud After 2020 Election 
Once the 2020 election was over, Mr. Trump 
made it clear that he would concede under 
no circumstances, and continued his full- 
court press urging Americans not to accept 
the election results. In a statement after Mr. 
Biden was projected the winner, Mr. Trump 
said, ‘‘The simple fact is this election is far from 
over . . . Beginning Monday, our campaign will 
start prosecuting our case in court to ensure 
election laws are fully upheld and the rightful 
winner is seated. The American People are enti-
tled to an honest election: that means counting 
all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal 
ballots. This is the only way to ensure the pub-
lic has full confidence in our election.’’ 72 
Mr. Trump escalated his attack on the 
election results by posting a speech on De-
cember 2nd, which he taped from behind the 
presidential lectern and characterized as po-
tentially ‘‘the most important speech I’ve 
ever made.’’ 73 Over the course of 46 minutes, 
Mr. Trump repeated the same baseless 
claims of voter fraud, and refused to ac-
knowledge his loss. Mr. Trump said the na-
tion’s election system was ‘‘under coordi-
nated assault and siege’’ and declared that it 
was ‘‘statistically impossible’’ for him to 
have lost to Mr. Biden.74 His overall claim 
was that, ‘‘This election is about great voter 
fraud, fraud that has never been seen like 
this before.’’ 75 
The day after Christmas 2020, Mr. Trump 
sought to escalate his narrative that there 
was a mass effort to deprive him of a second 
term. He sent out a series of tweets attack-
ing executive branch agencies, the federal ju-
diciary, and Senate Republicans, claiming 
that they had not done enough to prevent 
voter fraud. He tweeted that the Supreme 
Court ‘‘has been totally incompetent and weak 
on the massive Election Fraud that took place.’’ 
He also tweeted that ‘‘The ‘Justice’ Depart-
ment and the FBI have done nothing about the 
2020 Presidential Election Voter Fraud.’’ Fur-
thermore, he leveled the claim that ‘‘If a 
Democrat Presidential Candidate had an Elec-
tion Rigged & Stolen, with proof of such acts at 
a level never seen before, the Democrat Senators 
would consider it an act of war, and fight to the 
death. Mitch & the Republicans do NOTH-
ING.’’ 76 
As late as January 4th, Mr. Trump held a 
rally before the Georgia Senate runoff say-
ing, ‘‘When you win in a landslide and they 
steal it and it’s rigged, it’s not acceptable. 
Not acceptable.’’ The crowd chanted, ‘‘Fight 
for Trump!’’ and Mr. Trump responded, 
‘‘They’re not going to take the White House. 
We’re going to fight like hell.’’ 77 
In addition to his dishonest rhetoric on 
election fraud, Mr. Trump took concrete 
steps to bend reality to match what he want-
ed. As I will explain in more detail in Sec-
tion VIII, Mr. Trump used any means nec-
essary to cajole, intimidate, and threaten in-
dividuals at all levels of government to use 
their authority to reject, and in some cases 
alter, the electoral votes for Mr. Biden.78 
It is important to note that Mr. Trump 
forcefully pushed these lies, no matter how 
divorced from reality they became. In the 
weeks after the election, it became painstak-
ingly clear that Mr. Biden was the winner, as 
states moved to certify his results. In states 
where the Trump campaign asked for elec-
tion audits, subsequent recounts provided no 
compelling evidence that Mr. Trump had 
won by a landslide.79 He and his allies filed 
and lost over 60 lawsuits alleging voting 
irregularities in state and federal court, in-
cluding the Supreme Court.80 His Attorney 
General attested that the Justice Depart-
ment discovered no voting fraud ‘‘on a scale 
that could have effected a different outcome 
in the election.’’ 81 Top election officials put 
out a statement saying, ‘‘The November 3rd 
election was the most secure in American 
history . . . There is no evidence that any 
voting system deleted or lost votes, changed 
votes, or was in any way compromised.’’ 82 
The day before the Capitol insurrection, even 
Vice President Mike Pence told Mr. Trump 
that he had a constitutional duty to certify 
the true winner of the election, which was 
Mr. Biden.83 
Yet, throughout all of this and despite un-
deniable evidence to the contrary, Mr. 
Trump doggedly claimed that he had won the 
election, and that his supporters should help 
vindicate him. He lied to the American peo-
ple, and did so knowingly and deliberately. 
c. Mr. Trump Invoked Violent Means to Fur-
ther His Re-Election 
Leading up to January 6th, Mr. Trump sup-
ported—either tacitly or outright—the use of 
violent and menacing tactics by his sup-
porters. For example, in the spring of 2020, 
Mr. Trump embraced the backlash against 
COVID–19 policies to aid his re-election. Fol-
lowing armed protests over stay-at-home or-
ders, he tweeted ‘‘LIBERATE MINNESOTA!’’, 
‘‘LIBERATE MICHIGAN!’’ and ‘‘LIBERATE 
VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amend-
ment. It is under siege!’’ 84 During some of the 
anti-lockdown protests, armed groups at-
tempted to derail the legislative proceedings 
at statehouses in Michigan, Idaho, and Or-
egon.85
These 
disruptive 
and 
aggressive 
methods were in essence a prelude to what 
happened during the assault on the Capitol. 
This anger boiled over when six men plot-
ted to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen 
Whitmer because they were angry about the 
state’s coronavirus policies.86 When the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation foiled the plot, 
Mr. Trump added fuel to the fire, and at-
tacked Governor Whitmer over Twitter. He 
tweeted, ‘‘Governor Whitmer of Michigan has 
done a terrible job. She locked down her state 
for everyone, except her husband’s boating ac-
tivities . . . My Justice Department and Federal 
Law Enforcement announced . . . today that 
they foiled a dangerous plot against the Gov-
ernor of Michigan. Rather than say thank you, 
she calls me a White Supremacist—while Biden 
and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anar-
chists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Demo-
crat run cities.’’ 87 
Furthermore, in November 2020, Mr. Trump 
embraced a group of his followers who 
sought to intimidate supporters of his polit-
ical opponent. He posted a video of his sup-
porters in different cars surrounding a Biden 
campaign bus in Texas. Mr. Trump cheered 
this kind of intimidation, tweeting, ‘‘I LOVE 
TEXAS’’ and ‘‘In my opinion, these patriots did 
nothing wrong.’’ 88 At a rally in Michigan, Mr. 
Trump even praised his supporters’ actions 
saying, ‘‘Did you see the way our people, 
they were, ya know, protecting this bus . . . 
because they’re nice . . . They had hundreds 
of cars. Trump! Trump! Trump and the 
American flag.’’ 89 
After Mr. Biden was declared the winner, 
Mr. Trump focused his ire in the following 
weeks on changing the election results in 
Georgia. Mr. Trump’s relentless claims of 
voter fraud in Georgia were followed by a 
wave of death threats against state election 
officials. Gabriel Sterling, an election offi-
cial in Georgia, pleaded with Mr. Trump to 
denounce the threats of violence, clearly ar-
ticulating the risks of failing to do so. Ster-
ling said, ‘‘Mr. President, it looks like you 
likely lost the state of Georgia. We’re inves-
tigating. There’s always a possibility, I get 
it, and you have the rights to go through the 
courts. What you don’t have the ability to 
do—and you need to step up and say this—is 
stop inspiring people to commit potential 
acts of violence. Someone’s going to get 
hurt. Someone’s going to get shot. Some-
one’s going to get killed. And it’s not 
right.’’ 90 
d. Mr. Trump Supported Extremist Groups 
Mr. Trump made statements supporting, or 
failing to condemn members of extremist 
groups, many of whom came together to 
storm the Capitol on January 6th. 
Famously, during the first presidential de-
bate on September 29th, when asked to con-
demn white supremacist groups, like the 
Proud Boys, Trump refused. Instead, he an-
nounced, ‘‘Proud Boys—stand back and stand 
by.’’ 91 The Proud Boys group took this as an 
explicit endorsement of their violent tactics 
and ideology.92 A known social media ac-
count associated with the Proud Boys made 
‘‘Stand back and stand by’’ its new slogan, 
and Proud Boys leader Joe Biggs likewise 
posted that he was ‘‘standing by.’’ 93 
Mr. Trump also made statements and used 
social media to pander to Q’Anon, a con-
spiracy movement, including by retweeting 
messages from Q’Anon followers on Twitter 
hundreds of times before his account was 
suspended.94 When pressed on his views on 
Q’Anon, Mr. Trump appeared to defend the 
movement. On August 19th, Mr. Trump tac-
itly endorsed QAnon at a press conference, 
saying, ‘‘I don’t know much about the move-
ment, other than I understand they like me 
very much. Which I appreciate.’’ 95 In a town

hall on October 15th, Mr. Trump praised 
Q’Anon members again, this time saying, 
‘‘Let me just—let me just tell you, what I do 
hear about it, is they are very strongly 
against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I 
mean, I do agree with that. And I agree with 
it very strongly.’’ 96 
e. Mr. Trump Organized the January 6th 
‘‘Save America’’ Rally 
In the days leading up to January 6th, Mr. 
Trump sent out numerous tweets promoting 
the ‘‘Save America Rally’’ and gave his sup-
porters specific instructions on when and 
where to attend. On December 19th, he 
tweeted, ‘‘Big protest in D.C. on January 6th 
. . . Be there, will be wild!’’ 97 On December 27, 
he tweeted ‘‘See you in Washington, DC, on 
January 6th. Don’t miss it. Information to fol-
low.’’ 98 On January 1, 2021, he tweeted, ‘‘The 
BIG Protest Rally in Washington, D.C. will take 
place at 11:00 A.M. on January 6th. Locational 
details to follow. StopTheSteal!’’ 99 The day be-
fore, he posted, ‘‘I will be speaking at the 
SAVE AMERICA RALLY tomorrow on the El-
lipse at 11AM Eastern. Arrive early—doors open 
at 7AM Eastern. BIG CROWDS!’’ 100 
Mr. Trump not only knew, but actively co-
ordinated the January 6th rally in order to 
disrupt the congressional proceedings that 
day. First, Mr. Trump chose to convene a 
rally on the same day as the electoral cer-
tification, and then explicitly urged his sup-
porters to attend what he predicted would be 
a ‘‘wild’’ and ‘‘historic’’ day. Manager 
Plaskett underscored that it was only after 
Mr. Trump chose that day that the Pro- 
Trump group, Women for America First, ob-
tained a permit for what became the ‘‘Save 
America’’ rally at the Ellipse.101 The day 
after Women for America First announced 
the rally, Mr. Trump reposted their invita-
tion and replied ‘‘I will be there Historic 
day!’’ 102 Manager Plaskett stated that the 
Trump campaign even ‘‘became directly in-
volved with the planning of the event, in-
cluding the speaking line-up and even the 
music to be played and brought in the same 
people who spoke at the second Million 
MAGA rally to help.’’ 103 Notably, Vice Presi-
dent Pence’s sister-in-law is on the advisory 
board of Women for Trump, which has ties to 
Women for America First—thus blurring the 
lines between the Trump administration and 
the organizers of the January 6th rally.104 
Manager Plaskett also emphasized that 
Mr. Trump’s top advisors and the Trump 
communications team were actively moni-
toring posts from mainstream websites such 
as Twitter and Facebook, as well as pro- 
Trump 
message 
boards 
on 
Reddit 
and 
4Chan.105 Posters wrote about preparations 
for the rally in Washington, D.C. to take 
their election back, by violent means if nec-
essary, on these message boards. His sup-
porters posted hundreds of messages out-
lining their plans for January 6th. They dis-
cussed how to physically breach the Capitol 
grounds, which individuals to target once in-
side, and which weapons and tactical gear to 
take with them.106 
In this section, I outlined Mr. Trump’s 
words and actions leading up to the attack 
on the Capitol. I will now move onto exam-
ining whether Mr. Trump foreseeably or 
recklessly persuaded his supporters into be-
lieving his voter fraud lies and taking action 
at his behest to prevent what he considered 
a stolen election. 
C. Mr. Trump Foreseeably and Recklessly Per-
suaded His Supporters That the Election 
Was Stolen 
Mr. Trump spread lies, conspiracy theories, 
and incendiary rhetoric before and after the 
2020 election. He did so with the under-
standing that it would inflame his sup-
porters and enlist their aid in helping him 
disrupt the electoral process. The effect was 
to foreseeably and recklessly goad his sup-
porters into action. We know this because 
there is evidence that his supporters were 
buying into his delegitimizing the election, 
his encouragement of taking action to over-
turn the electoral process, and his support 
for violent tactics. 
Mr. Trump’s promotion of themes such as 
‘‘Stop the Count’’ and ‘‘Stop the Steal’’ 
served to gin up his supporters. Manager 
Swalwell pointed out that Mr. Trump spent 
‘‘millions of dollars to amplify that lie . . . 
[I]n mid-December, President Trump an-
nounced the release of ads, including ones 
entitled ‘’The Evidence is Overwhelming— 
FRAUD!’’ and ‘‘STOP THE STEAL.’’ He 
spent $50 million from his legal defense fund 
on these ads to stop the steal and amplify his 
message. They were released nationally, 
played in video ads, online advertising, and 
targeted text messages.’’ 107 
His supporters took these ideas literally— 
angrily converging upon vote centers on No-
vember 5th to protest the continued count-
ing of ballots after Election Day.108 Trump 
supporters formed ‘‘Stop the Steal’’ online 
groups, which became a hotbed for sharing 
false claims and misleading videos about 
voter fraud. In November and December, his 
supporters held ‘‘Stop the Steal’’ rallies 
around the country. It was widely publicized 
that, at some of these events, participants 
were armed and belligerent. Notably, on De-
cember 12th, they staged the Second Million 
MAGA March in Washington, D.C., which re-
sulted in violent clashes between Proud Boy 
members and counter protestors.109
Mr. 
Trump promoted these rallies on his social 
media, and, in some instances, heaped praise 
on his supporters for fighting.110 
The evidence showed that Mr. Trump’s pro-
motion of the ‘‘Save America’’ rally suc-
ceeded in convincing his supporters to show 
up at the time and place he named on Janu-
ary 6th. Many of Mr. Trump’s supporters said 
that they felt summoned to Washington, 
D.C. to take retaliatory action. In a Parler 
post before the insurrection, a supporter 
shared one of Mr. Trump’s tweets and wrote, 
‘‘This isn’t a joke, this is where and when we 
make our stand. #January6th, Washington 
DC. Be there, no matter what. Nothing is 
more important.’’ 111 In a statement taped on 
a livestream video taken during the insur-
rection, a man is heard saying, ‘‘Our presi-
dent wants us here We wait and take orders 
from our president.’’ 112 In court papers and 
interviews given after the insurrection, pro- 
Trump rioters said they joined the march be-
cause the president encouraged them to do 
so.113 
I find overwhelmingly clear and convincing 
evidence that Mr. Trump and his allies 
foreseeably and recklessly solicited his sup-
porters to help him overturn the election re-
sults—including most prominently by at-
tending the January 6th rally to disrupt the 
Electoral College certification. 
D. Mr. Trump’s Supporters Committed Unlawful 
Acts of Insurrection on January 6th 
a. Trump Speaks at the ‘‘Save America’’ Rally 
After months of fomenting anger over his 
false claims of election fraud, Mr. Trump 
gathered his supporters at the ‘‘Save Amer-
ica’’ rally on January 6th. Once there, Mr. 
Trump told the crowd ‘‘We’re going to walk 
down to the Capitol because you’ll never 
take back our country with weakness. You 
have to show strength and you have to be 
strong.’’ 114 This was a continuation of a pat-
tern of violent rhetoric by Mr. Trump lead-
ing up to the events at the Capitol. For ex-
ample, Mr. Trump had previously told fol-
lowers to ‘‘Fight like Hell’’ at rallies. He re-
peated this language at the rally at noon on 
January 6th stating, ‘‘[W]e fight. We fight 
like hell.’’ 115 His supporters got the message. 
By 12:53pm, a large group of Trump sup-
porters approached a fenced off area in front 
of the Capitol and began to engage with Cap-
itol police officers, many of whom were 
armed only with mace and their side arms.116 
b. The Insurrection Begins 
The crowd pushed past the barricade, 
knocking down police officers in the process, 
in an attempt to get closer to the building. 
Within minutes, protestors began swarming 
other entrances of the Capitol.117 Inside the 
Capitol, Vice President Pence presided over 
the joint session of Congress. Contrary to 
the wishes of Mr. Trump, Vice President 
Pence began the process of certifying the 
election results. Outside the Capitol, the 
crowd of protestors grew more violent. ‘‘Ri-
oters wearing Trump paraphernalia shoved 
and punched Capitol Police officers, gouged 
their eyes, assaulted them with pepper spray 
and projectiles, and denounced them as ‘cow-
ards’ and ‘traitors.’ ’’ 118 Law enforcement of-
ficers were attacked with baseball bats, 
crutches, hockey sticks, flag poles, and fire 
extinguishers.119 Some rioters came armed 
with handguns, pepper spray, knives, and 
brass knuckles.120 Congressional staff and re-
porters were warned to stay away from win-
dows and doors.121 
c. Rioters Storm the Capitol 
Between 2pm and 2:30pm, rioters broke 
through multiple entrances and began push-
ing deeper into the Capitol, flooding the Ro-
tunda, Crypt, Statuary Hall, and other loca-
tions.122 Videos captured by rioters show the 
crowd, many in Trump paraphernalia, chant-
ing ‘‘Stop the Steal’’ and ‘‘U.S.A.’’ as they 
breached the Capitol and overpowered secu-
rity.123 
Meanwhile, the Joint Session had sepa-
rated into different chambers. The Senate 
was in the midst of a debate regarding an ob-
jection to certifying Arizona’s Electoral Col-
lege votes.124
Secret Service rushed Vice 
President Pence out of the Senate chambers 
and took him and members of his family to 
a secure location within the Capitol.125 Cap-
itol Police officer Eugene Goodman led riot-
ers away from the entrance to the Senate 
chambers, narrowly avoiding a potentially 
deadly encounter between Members of the 
Senate and rioters.126 Senators were then 
evacuated from the Chamber.127 
On the other side of the Capitol, the House 
went into recess and members were told to 
lock down and shelter in place.128 By 2:45 pm, 
members of the Capitol Security Team were 
forced to barricade the doors to the Chamber 
as insurrectionists attempted to break in. 
House Members were instructed to put on 
gas masks and some attempted to build 
makeshift shelters in case the mob broke 
through the doors.129 Members who were on 
the ground level were evacuated through the 
Speaker’s Lobby as Capitol Security guarded 
the door with guns.130 Ashli Babbitt, an Air 
Force veteran, was fatally shot as she and 
others tried to break through the barricaded 
glass door.131 Members, reporters, and staff 
in the Gallery remained trapped one floor 
above the rioters. Videos taken during the 
events on January 6th show this group sit-
ting and lying down in the aisles in an at-
tempt to shelter behind the chairs.132 One 
particularly moving photo shows Represent-
ative Jason Crow (D-CO), a former Army 
Ranger, comforting Representative Susan 
Wild (D-PA) as the pair sheltered in the Gal-
lery.133 Rep. Crow recounted that he was 
doing what any friend would do, telling Rep. 
Wild ‘‘that I was there for her, and that we 
would get through it.’’ 134
Another video 
shows Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) 
praying loudly in the Gallery for safety and 
peace as she and other lawmakers, including 
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), watched Cap-
itol Police officers barricade the door to the 
Chamber.135

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S931 
March 1, 2021 
d. The Rioters Target Vice President Pence 
and Speaker Pelosi 
As members of Congress moved to secure 
locations or sheltered in place, rioters 
walked the halls carrying Confederate flags, 
vandalizing the building, and breaking into 
congressional offices, including the office of 
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.136 One ri-
oter said that he and other rioters ‘‘kicked 
in Nancy Pelosi’s office door’’ and that 
‘‘Crazy Nancy probably would have been torn 
into little pieces but she was nowhere to be 
seen.’’ 137 The use of the term ‘‘Crazy Nancy’’ 
is significant, for this is Mr. Trump’s nick-
name for the Speaker of the House. Vice 
President Mike Pence was another primary 
target for the most violent sections of the 
mob. ‘‘Once we found out Pence turned on us 
and that they had stolen the election, like, 
officially, the crowd went crazy,’’ said one ri-
oter.138 Rioters called for Pence’s death.139 
Throughout the Capitol, Members and their 
staff barricaded themselves in offices, hid 
under tables, called loved ones, and prayed 
for safety.140 
e. The President Fails to Respond to or Con-
demn the Violence at the Capitol 
President’s Counsel argue that the Presi-
dent did not intend or anticipate for violence 
to take place. If that were the case, one 
would expect that—as soon as it was clear 
that the rioters had begun engaging in un-
lawful or violent acts—Mr. Trump would 
quickly and clearly condemn these actions 
and take every action possible to stop fur-
ther 
violence. 
Arguably, 
once 
the 
lawbreaking began, it was only Mr. Trump 
that had the most potent power at that point 
to get his supporters to stop. However, in-
stead of acting expeditiously, it took him 
more than two hours after the rioters 
stormed the Capitol to make a statement. In 
this time, it is reported that lawmakers and 
Trump advisors pleaded with him to call off 
the angry mob and denounce the violence.141 
Mr. Trump was seemingly unmoved by these 
pleas for help, and it is even reported that he 
was pleased by the actions of his sup-
porters.142
Rather than call off his sup-
porters, it is reported that Mr. Trump called 
a Member of the Senate asking him to raise 
additional objections to certifying the Elec-
toral College results.143 Not until 4:15pm did 
Mr. Trump release a pre-recorded message, 
telling supporters to go home. The video 
statement did not condemn the rioters’ ac-
tions at the Capitol. 
Mr. Trump’s delay in responding to the in-
surrection is unsurprising, for many of the 
rioters thought they were ‘‘answer[ing] the 
call of my President.’’ 144 In a livestreamed 
video from inside the Capitol, one rioter de-
clared that ‘‘[o]ur president wants us here. 
. . . We wait and take orders from our presi-
dent.’’ 145 Another rioter claimed that she 
‘‘thought I was following my President. He 
asked us to fly there, he asked us to be there, 
so I was doing what he asked us to do.’’ 146 
One supporter, who was later arrested for his 
actions on January 6th, stated through his 
lawyer that he, ‘‘acted out of the delusional 
belief that he was a ‘patriot’ protecting his 
country . . . He was responding to the en-
treaties of the-then commander in chief, 
President Trump. . . . The President main-
tained that the election had been stolen and 
it was the duty of loyal citizens to ‘stop the 
steal.’ ’’ 147 To paraphrase the House Man-
agers, Mr. Trump sold his followers the big 
lie of a stolen election and then provoked 
those followers to violent action to ‘‘stop the 
steal.’’ 
In his late statement on the events at the 
Capitol, 
Trump 
urged 
his 
followers 
to 
‘‘Please support our Capitol Police and law 
enforcement stay peaceful.’’ Of course, the 
insurrection was never peaceful, and the 
Capitol Police were treated cruelly by the 
mob. Over the course of the insurrection, 140 
police officers were injured and one officer, 
Brian Sicknick, was killed. Four rioters also 
died. Congressional Leadership offices were 
trashed, the walls of the Capitol bore the 
marks of bullets, monuments were de-
stroyed, windows were smashed and broken 
in, Members and staff were terrorized, Sen-
ate desks were ransacked, and smoke hung 
in the air. Mr. Trump should have pleaded 
with the crowd to stand down and leave the 
Capitol as soon as the insurrection began. 
The fact that he waited to address the riot-
ers, and downplayed the severity of the in-
surrection to the point of even praising the 
patriotism of the rioters, was not just dere-
liction of duty. It was malicious disregard 
for the lives of Capitol Police, Members of 
Congress, staff, and Capitol workers threat-
ened by the mob that he incited. 
f. The Capitol is Cleared and the Election Re-
sults are Certified 
It took more than four hours after the riot-
ers first entered the building to secure the 
Capitol and another three hours before the 
Joint Session could resume.148 Nevertheless, 
Joseph R. Biden Jr. was confirmed the win-
ner of the 2020 election at approximately 
4am.149 Democracy prevailed. 
E. The First Amendment Is Not a Defense to Mr. 
Trump’s Incitement of Insurrection 
President’s Counsel argued at trial that 
Mr. Trump was exercising his First Amend-
ment rights in expressing his views at the 
‘‘Save America’’ rally, and thus cannot be 
convicted in this proceeding. I conclude that 
there is overwhelmingly clear and con-
vincing evidence that the First Amendment 
does not inoculate him from the current Im-
peachment charge. 
a. The First Amendment Is Not a Bar to Im-
peachment 
As I explained in Section II, the relevant 
standard in an Impeachment trial is whether 
a president committed impeachable ‘‘high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ An impeachable 
offense need not violate a criminal or other 
established law. Indeed, even an action that 
is lawful or otherwise protected by the Con-
stitution can still be an impeachable offense. 
Rather the appropriate standard in this pro-
ceeding is whether an offense is ‘‘incompat-
ible with either the constitutional form and 
principles of our government or the proper 
performance of constitutional duties of the 
presidential office.’’ 150 In addition, as I ex-
plained in Section IV, there is no defined 
standard of proof in an Impeachment, and 
there are no requirements to adhere to the 
same standards as in a criminal prosecution. 
As a result, in an Impeachment trial, the 
Senate is simply not bound by a determina-
tion of whether Mr. Trump is protected by 
the First Amendment, nor must the Senate 
demand a showing that every element of a 
criminal charge of incitement has been met. 
b. Mr. Trump’s Speech Likely Satisfies the 
Standard of Incitement 
Although I have concluded that the First 
Amendment does not necessarily serve as a 
shield in this proceeding, I find it persuasive 
that the bedrock principle of free speech has 
a long history in our country. Therefore, I 
undertook an examination of the governing 
case precedent regarding incitement. I have 
concluded that, even if the First Amendment 
were to apply in this case, Mr. Trump’s over-
all course of conduct would satisfy the 
standard for incitement. 
The First Amendment prohibits any law 
‘‘abridging the freedom of speech.’’ 151 How-
ever, even at our country’s founding, it is 
clear that the First Amendment was not in-
tended to provide absolute protection for 
every utterance. Of the fourteen states that 
ratified the Constitution by 1792, thirteen 
had laws limiting libelous or blasphemous 
speech.152 In addition, the Supreme Court has 
recognized specific categories of speech that 
are not protected by the First Amendment 
and which the government may regulate be-
cause of their content. These categories are 
‘‘obscenity, defamation, fraud, incitement, 
fighting words, true threats, speech integral 
to criminal conduct, and child pornog-
raphy.’’ 153 
The relevant legal framework for incite-
ment was established by the U.S. Supreme 
Court in the 1969 case of Brandenburg v. 
Ohio.154 In that case, a Ku Klux Klan leader, 
Clarence Brandenburg, was convicted after 
making a speech at a Klan rally that appar-
ently 
broke 
an 
Ohio 
law 
against 
‘‘advocat[ing] crime, sabotage, violence, or 
unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of 
accomplishing industrial or political re-
form.’’ 155
The Supreme Court overturned 
Brandenburg’s conviction and struck down 
the statute on First Amendment grounds. In 
doing so, the Court articulated a new test for 
when advocating for violence or lawbreaking 
could be criminally prosecuted. The Bran-
denburg test defines unprotected incitement 
as speech that is ‘‘directed to inciting or pro-
ducing imminent lawless action and is likely 
to incite or produce such action.’’ 156 
Subsequent cases further clarified the ‘‘im-
minence’’ standard set out in Brandenburg. 
In the Supreme Court case of Hess v. Indi-
ana, Gregory Hess was attending an anti- 
Vietnam war protest when the police moved 
a group of protesters from the street onto 
the sidewalk.157 Hess said, ‘‘We’ll take the 
[effing] street later’’ and was convicted for 
disorderly conduct.158 The Supreme Court re-
versed Hess’ conviction, concluding, ‘‘Since 
the uncontroverted evidence showed that 
Hess’ statement was not directed to any per-
son or group of persons, it cannot be said 
that he was advocating, in the normal sense, 
any action. And since there was no evidence, 
or rational inference from the import of the 
language, that his words were intended to 
produce, and likely to produce, imminent 
disorder, those words could not be punished 
by the State on the ground that they had ‘a 
tendency to lead to violence.’ ’’ 159 
The Supreme Court subsequently explained 
that a finding of ‘‘imminence’’ also hinged 
upon the context and timing connecting 
speech and subsequent acts of lawbreaking. 
In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Company, 
a local branch of the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People 
(NAACP) organized a boycott of white-owned 
stores in Mississippi.160
The boycott was 
largely supported by impassioned speeches 
encouraging nonviolent picketing—including 
by boycott organizer Charles Evers—but 
some acts and threats of violence did 
occur.161 The Court concluded, ‘‘There are 
three separate theories that might justify 
holding Evers liable . . . First, a finding that 
he authorized, directed, or ratified specific 
tortious activity would justify holding him 
responsible for the consequences of that ac-
tivity. Second, a finding that his public 
speeches were likely to incite lawless action 
could justify holding him liable for unlawful 
conduct that in fact followed within a rea-
sonable period. Third, the speeches might be 
taken as evidence that Evers gave other spe-
cific instructions to carry out violent acts or 
threats.’’ 162 In the specific case of Evers’ 
speech, the Court concluded ‘‘In the course 
of [Evers’] pleas, strong language was used. 
If that language had been followed by acts of 
violence, a substantial question would be 
presented whether Evers could be held liable 
for the consequences of that unlawful con-
duct. In this case, however the acts of vio-
lence identified in 1966 occurred weeks or 
months after [his] April 1, 1966, speech.’’ 163

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S932 
March 1, 2021 
There is overwhelmingly clear and con-
vincing evidence that Mr. Trump’s overall 
course of conduct meets the spirit of the 
Brandenburg test. As laid out in the Clai-
borne case, a finding of ‘‘imminence’’ should 
take into account the context and timing of 
Mr. Trump’s January 6th rally speech. After 
months of fueling the narrative that the 
election was stolen from him, Mr. Trump 
asked his supporters to assemble on the day 
that Congress would be certifying the elec-
tion results. Once Mr. Trump had gathered 
his supporters—knowing that they would lis-
ten—he directed the crowd to ‘‘walk down 
Pennsylvania Avenue,’’ ‘‘fight like hell,’’ and 
‘‘stop the steal.’’ Unlike the speech in Clai-
borne, which was far removed in time, the 
lawlessness was imminent because it hap-
pened a short distance and short time after 
Mr. Trump’s speech. Unlike the indefinite 
speech in Hess, Mr. Trump’s speech was di-
rected at a specific group of persons, and 
subsequent acts of violence are directly 
traceable to people who had listened to Mr. 
Trump’s calls to action. 
On the issue of Mr. Trump’s intent, wheth-
er or not Mr. Trump specifically intended 
every act of violence, he set these events in 
motion. If Mr. Trump truly did not intend 
for lawbreaking, what did he expect his sup-
porters would do once they reached the Cap-
itol? How did he expect his supporters to 
lawfully achieve the aim of preventing elec-
tors from being counted? From this evidence, 
we can infer that Mr. Trump understood 
there was a high likelihood that his sup-
porters would break the law once they got to 
the Capitol. 
Further revealing his state of mind, Mr. 
Trump did not publicly disapprove of the in-
surrection as it was happening, or take con-
crete steps to clear the mob. The first public 
statement he made, once the mob had 
breached the Capitol, was to disparage Vice 
President Pence for failing to block the cer-
tification. Instead of acting expeditiously, it 
took him nearly two hours to acknowledge 
the attack. In his three statements that day, 
he repeated false claims that the election 
was stolen and sympathized with his fol-
lowers. There are reports that he even called 
a sitting Senator to ask him to object to ad-
ditional states, as the insurrection was tak-
ing place. In addition, there is no evidence 
that Mr. Trump tried to activate the Na-
tional Guard, and even rebuffed requests to 
do so. The question becomes how did Mr. 
Trump expect these actions—criticizing the 
Vice President, urging additional electoral 
objections, and praising his supporters—to 
calm down tensions? How did he foresee that 
the overwhelmed Capitol police would be 
able to push back the mob without addi-
tional law enforcement assistance? From 
this evidence, we can infer that Mr. Trump 
was satisfied, or at least was not displeased, 
that his actions had inflamed his supporters 
to violently disrupt the electoral certifi-
cation. 
c. Mr. Trump’s Speech Was Held to a Higher 
Standard as a Public Official 
It is further important to note that Mr. 
Trump was not making statements in his ca-
pacity as a private citizen but as president of 
the United States. In the Supreme Court 
case, Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Court held 
that ‘‘when a citizen enters government 
service, the citizen by necessity must accept 
certain limitations on his or her free-
dom.’’ 164 In this case, the respondent was 
disciplined for a memorandum he wrote as 
part of his employment in a district attor-
ney’s office, and asserted that his super-
visors 
violated 
his 
First 
Amendment 
rights.165 The Court concluded ‘‘We hold that 
when public employees make statements 
pursuant to their official duties, the employ-
ees are not speaking as citizens for First 
Amendment purposes, and the Constitution 
does not insulate their communications from 
employer discipline.166 
In Mr. Trump’s case, it would be difficult 
to argue that he gave a political speech at 
the ‘‘Save America’’ rally outside the course 
of performing his official duties. The purpose 
of the speech was to use his role as president 
to urge his supporters to stop the certifi-
cation of Biden’s electoral win. In addition, 
there is evidence that members of the crowd 
had taken Mr. Trump’s invocations to attend 
the rally, and his insisting that they head to 
the Capitol, as instructions coming from the 
president.167 
Moreover, as Manager Raskin explained, a 
president takes an oath to uphold the laws, 
the Constitution, and the principles of our 
republic.168
In exchange, the president is 
given tremendous power and prestige—more 
so than any other person in the country. 
That is why, in an instant, a president’s 
words can calm, agitate, or otherwise change 
the landscape on issues ranging from foreign 
affairs, to the economy, to the rule of law. 
Not only can the president’s words have an 
expansive ripple effect, they are more likely 
to succeed in inciting action from the public. 
These potent powers can be wielded by the 
president for the good of the country, or can 
be exploited to subject it to the gravest 
abuses. That is why—for the protection of 
our laws and democratic institutions—a 
president’s primary obligation is to uphold 
their oath of office, and any freedom of ex-
pression must yield to that higher duty. 
In this case, Mr. Trump did not have a 
First Amendment right to fuel a mass 
disinformation campaign, foreseeably fan 
the flames of political division, and then di-
rect a mob to disrupt a congressional pro-
ceeding. 
VII. OBSTRUCTION OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE 
In inciting the insurrection on January 6th 
and attempting to overturn the 2020 election, 
Mr. Trump attempted to destroy our demo-
cratic system and negate the will of the 
American people. 
The Electoral College process is laid out in 
the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution, 
which states: 
‘‘The Electors shall meet in their respec-
tive states and vote by ballot for President 
and Vice-President, one of whom, at least 
. . . they shall make distinct lists of all per-
sons voted for as President, and of all per-
sons voted for as Vice-President, and of the 
number of votes for each, which lists they 
shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to 
the seat of the government of the United 
States, directed to the President of the Sen-
ate;—the President of the Senate shall, in 
the presence of the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives, open all the certificates and 
the votes shall then be counted[.]’’ 
Just as the Electoral College has been car-
ried out and affirmed since the first presi-
dential election of President George Wash-
ington,169 the 2020 election took place accord-
ing to the requirements of the Constitution. 
Voters in each respective state and territory 
chose their electors to serve in the Electoral 
College,170 with Mr. Biden winning a major-
ity of 306 electoral votes.171 On December 14, 
2020, the appointed electors convened state- 
by-state to cast their ballots for the Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United 
States, and certified the results.172 On Janu-
ary 6th to 7th of 2020, Congress counted the 
certified votes, and declared Mr. Biden and 
Kamala Harris the winners. 173 
Throughout the Electoral College process, 
Mr. Trump attempted to interfere and nul-
lify the outcome. For example, as discussed 
in Section VII, Mr. Trump was at the head of 
a mass disinformation campaign to discredit 
the election results before the election had 
even gotten underway, and then filed dozens 
of 
lawsuits 
alleging 
widespread 
voter 
fraud.174 In addition, as I will outline, he 
wielded his overwhelming power as president 
to cajole and intimidate members of federal, 
state, and local government to start inves-
tigations, file lawsuits, and reject electoral 
votes in a bid to overturn the 2020 election. 
A. Mr. Trump Attempted to Use Federal Law 
Enforcement Agencies to Carry Out Inves-
tigations and File Lawsuits 
After losing the 2020 election, Mr. Trump 
pushed the Justice Department to inves-
tigate his meritless allegations of election 
irregularities.175 He also pushed the Justice 
Department to ask the Supreme Court to in-
validate Mr. Biden’s victory, which his ap-
pointees refused to do, citing the lack of evi-
dence.176 Mr. Trump even disparaged his own 
FBI and DOJ, implying that they were work-
ing against him. In an interview, Mr. Trump 
said, ‘‘This is total fraud. And how the F.B.I. 
and Department of Justice—I don’t know, 
maybe they’re involved—but how people are 
allowed to get away with this stuff is unbe-
lievable. This election was a total fraud . . . 
Missing in action . . . Can’t tell you where 
they are.’’ 177 
Succumbing to this pressure, Attorney 
General William Barr issued a memorandum 
to U.S. attorneys across the country allow-
ing them to pursue any ‘‘substantial allega-
tions’’ of voting irregularities before the 2020 
presidential election was certified.178
The 
memorandum gave prosecutors the ability to 
sidestep longstanding Justice Department 
policy of not taking overt steps on possible 
election fraud before results are certified. In 
response, career DOJ prosecutors called on 
Mr. Barr to rescind the memo, because it was 
not based on fact and there was no evidence 
of widespread voter fraud.179 
After Mr. Barr stepped down as Attorney 
General, Mr. Trump then reportedly pres-
sured Barr’s successor, Acting Attorney Gen-
eral Jeffrey Rosen, to file legal briefs seek-
ing to overturn his election loss.180 He want-
ed Mr. Rosen to appoint special counsels, in-
cluding a counsel who would look into Do-
minion Voting Systems—which is at the cen-
ter of a right-wing conspiracy theory accus-
ing the company of conspiring with the Ven-
ezuelan government to tip the election to-
ward Mr. Biden. Mr. Rosen refused the presi-
dent’s entreaties. Mr. Trump then plotted 
with Jeffrey Clark, a Trump loyalist and the 
head of the DOJ’s civil division, to oust Mr. 
Rosen as acting attorney general, and re-
place him with Mr. Clark, who was willing to 
do Mr. Trump’s bidding in trying to overturn 
the Georgia election results. This plan was 
only unsuccessful because Mr. Trump’s advi-
sors convinced him the move could poten-
tially lead to mass resignations within DOJ’s 
leadership and lead to congressional inves-
tigations.181 
B. Mr. Trump Exerted Inappropriate Pressure 
on State Elected Officials 
Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 provides that 
each state shall appoint electors ‘‘in such 
Manner as the Legislature thereof may di-
rect.’’ 182 However, the decisions on how and 
when to choose electors is left up to the 
states. The Electoral Count Act only re-
quires that states be required to certify their 
elections at least six days before the electors 
meet to vote.183 After his loss on Election 
Day, Mr. Trump sought to exploit the ambig-
uous language of the Electoral Count Act 
that gives states discretion in choosing elec-
tors. Most state laws require the appoint-
ment of electors who vote according to the 
outcome of the popular vote in each state.184 
However, Mr. Trump sought to use the 
weight of his office to persuade and, in some

cases, intimidate state officials. For exam-
ple, he invited GOP members of the Michi-
gan state legislature to the White House, in 
a brazen bid to get them to throw out the 
state’s election results.185 He also called two 
members of the Wayne County Board of Can-
vassers, including its Republican chair-
woman, who had already voted to certify 
that Joe Biden won their county.186 Within 24 
hours of the call, the Republican chair-
woman announced that she wanted to ‘‘re-
scind’’ her vote.187 Her reasoning mirrored 
Mr. Trump’s claims that the election may 
have been rife with fraud. In another in-
stance, he called the speaker of the Pennsyl-
vania House of Representatives, Bryan Cut-
ler, and inquired about the electoral process. 
According to Cutler’s spokesperson, Mr. 
Trump blatantly asked, ‘‘I’m hearing about 
all these issues in Philadelphia, and these 
issues with your law What can we do to fix 
it?’’ 188 
Mr. Trump’s effort hit its crescendo when 
the Trump campaign convinced supporters in 
several states to create an alternate slate of 
electors to send for the congressional certifi-
cation.189 The Trump campaign helped orga-
nize alternate Electoral College meetings in 
Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia, 
New Mexico, and Nevada.190 However, elec-
tion law experts dismissed the validity of 
these false electors, which had ‘‘neither been 
certified by state executives nor purportedly 
appointed by state legislators.’’ 191 
Mr. Trump also took extra effort to influ-
ence the outcome of the Georgia election, a 
fierce battleground state. In early December, 
he called Governor Brian Kemp and asked 
him to hold a special session of the Georgia 
legislature to appoint Trump electors to re-
verse Mr. Biden’s win. Mr. Trump also want-
ed Kemp to order an audit of absentee ballot 
signatures. When Kemp told the former 
president he would not be complying with ei-
ther demand, Mr. Trump told a crowd of sup-
porters at a Georgia rally that, ‘‘Your gov-
ernor could stop it very easily if he knew 
what the hell he was doing . . . So far we 
haven’t been able to find the people in Geor-
gia willing to do the right thing.’’ 192 
In the most extraordinary example of his 
inappropriate interactions with state law-
makers, Mr. Trump outright tried to coerce 
Georgia 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Brad 
Raffensperger, ‘‘to find’’ 11,780 votes—which 
would amount to the one vote margin he 
needed to win the state.193 Mr. Trump spent 
roughly an hour haranguing Raffensperger 
and Ryan Germany, the Georgia secretary of 
state’s general counsel, about doing another 
vote count and insisting on baseless con-
spiracy theories. Even when presented with 
facts to the contrary by Raffensperger and 
Germany, who are both Republicans, Mr. 
Trump did not relent. 
Mr. Trump also made veiled threats of how 
his supporters would punish Republicans if 
the Georgia election officials did not go 
along with what he was asking. Specifically, 
he told Raffensperger, who will be up for re-
election in 2022, ‘‘[T]hey hate the state, they 
hate the governor, and they hate the sec-
retary of state. I will tell you that right now. 
And the only people that like you are people 
that will never vote for you. You know that, 
Brad, right?’’ 194 
Mr. 
Trump 
even 
suggested 
that 
Raffensperger 
and 
Germany 
would 
face 
criminal consequences if they refused to in-
tervene, saying ‘‘[T]he ballots are corrupt. 
And you’re going to find that they are— 
which is totally illegal, it is more illegal for 
you than it is for them because, you know 
what they did and you’re not reporting it. 
That’s a criminal—that’s a criminal offense. 
And you can’t let that happen. That’s a big 
risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. ’’ 195 
In the end, Mr. Trump made so many false 
claims about the Georgia election, a top 
state official had to publicly debunk the 
claims one-by-one to restore public trust in 
the integrity of their election.196 
C. Mr. Trump Lobbied Vice President Pence to 
Reject Electoral Votes 
Vice President Pence presided over the 
January 6th certification of electoral votes. 
This role is spelled out by Article II, Section 
1 of the Constitution, which dictates that 
‘‘The President of the Senate shall, in the 
presence of the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives, open all the certificates and 
the votes shall then be counted.’’ 197 In con-
ducting this duty, the Vice President has no 
more power than to determine whether the 
certificates submitted by each state are au-
thentic and then to count the votes.198 
In the days leading up to and on January 
6th, Mr. Trump denied the constitutional re-
ality of the Vice President’s role and made it 
clear that he wanted Vice President Pence to 
block electoral votes for Mr. Biden. At his 
behest, a group of Republican lawmakers 
filed a lawsuit against Vice President Pence. 
The lawsuit alleged that the Twelfth Amend-
ment gave the Vice President, and not 
states, unilateral power to determine which 
among competing slates of electors may be 
counted.199 Mr. Trump’s own Justice Depart-
ment stepped in to defend Mr. Pence, and a 
federal judge tossed out the lawsuit after 
finding 
that 
the 
Republican 
lawmakers 
lacked standing to sue in this case.200 
Still, Mr. Trump unabashedly and repeat-
edly tried to coerce Vice President Pence 
into unilaterally rejecting the election re-
sults. On January 2nd, he falsely proclaimed 
over Twitter that, ‘‘The Vice President has 
the power to reject fraudulently chosen elec-
tors.’’ 201 Two days later, Mr. Trump said at 
a rally in Georgia that, ‘‘I hope Mike Pence 
comes through for us, I have to tell you . . . 
Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I 
won’t like him as much.’’ 202 Trump report-
edly met with and called Pence multiple 
times—plying him to object to Biden’s vic-
tory, including at least one time with 
threatening language.203 Trump reportedly 
solicited others in his orbit to put pressure 
on the Vice President, including Rudy 
Giuliani and trade adviser Peter Navarro.204 
Despite the enormous pressure, Mr. Pence 
told Mr. Trump that he planned to certify 
the election results for Mr. Biden.205 
In response, Mr. Trump tweeted on the 
morning of January 6th that, ‘‘All Mike Pence 
has to do is send [the votes] back to the States, 
AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for ex-
treme courage!’’ 206 He also tweeted ‘‘If Vice 
President @Mike—Pence comes through for 
us, we will win the Presidency. Many States 
want to decertify the mistake they made in 
certifying incorrect & even fraudulent num-
bers in a process NOT approved by their 
State Legislatures (which it must be). Mike 
can send it back!’’ 207 In his remarks at the 
‘‘Save America’’ rally itself, Mr. Trump said, 
‘‘I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. 
I hope so. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence 
does the right thing, we win the election. 
. . . And I actually—I just spoke to Mike. I 
said: ’Mike, that doesn’t take courage. What 
takes courage is to do nothing. That takes 
courage.’ ’’ 208 
Once the electoral vote count had begun, it 
was clear that Vice President Pence was not 
going to comply with his demands. Mr. 
Trump attacked him on Twitter writing, 
‘‘Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do 
what should have been done to protect our 
Country and our Constitution, giving States a 
chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the 
fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were 
asked to previously certify. USA demands the 
truth!’’ 209 
D. Mr. Trump Encouraged Members of Congress 
to Deny and Overturn the Election Results 
Once it was clear that Mr. Trump had no 
plans of conceding, even after Mr. Biden had 
been declared the presumptive winner, Re-
publicans were faced with a choice. Manager 
Lieu explained that Mr. Trump targeted 
Members of Congress on social media mak-
ing it clear he saw their siding with him as 
a loyalty test. Mr. Trump reminded Repub-
licans that he, in his view, had gotten them 
elected and he expected their gratitude.210 
Under these threats of retribution, Mr. 
Trump was successful in getting Republicans 
to line up with him—in either refusing to ac-
knowledge that Mr. Biden had won or worse, 
enabling his baseless claims of a rigged elec-
tion.211 
In early December, Mr. Trump also identi-
fied an ally in the House of Representatives 
who was circulating a Dear Colleague letter 
asking Republican members to sign onto an 
amicus brief supporting a lawsuit filed by 
the Texas Republican Attorney General in 
the Supreme Court to void the election re-
sults of other states.212 Mr. Trump began to 
personally lobby House Republicans asking 
them to sign the amicus brief.213 In the end, 
one hundred and twenty six Republican 
members of Congress signed on, including 
the House Minority Leader.214 The U.S. Su-
preme Court rejected the lawsuit saying the 
state of Texas lacked standing to pursue the 
case.215 
As an extension of Mr. Trump’ pressure 
campaign, Republican Members of Congress 
began to similarly view the certification of 
the Electoral College as a loyalty test to Mr. 
Trump. A few days before January 6th, elev-
en current and then-incoming Republican 
senators announced that they would vote to 
reject the Electoral College votes of some 
states as not ‘‘lawfully certified,’’ unless 
Congress appointed a commission to conduct 
an emergency, ten day audit of the election 
results.216 One hundred and forty Republican 
Members of the House planned a similar ef-
fort.217
Together, the Senate and House 
Members planned to object to the counting 
of electors from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, 
Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.218 
The question is not whether these Mem-
bers had the legal right to object to electors 
but whether there were facts to support the 
objections. At that point, the results of the 
election and lack of substantive voting irreg-
ularities was affirmed by dozens of judges, 
the U.S. Supreme Court, governors, and elec-
tion officials.219 In addition, Department of 
Homeland Security officials put out a state-
ment that said, ‘‘The November 3rd election 
was the most secure in American history.’’220 
Attorney General Barr put out a similar 
statement that said, ‘‘[We] have not seen 
fraud on a scale that could have effected a 
different outcome in the election.’’221 In the 
face of all this evidence, the subsequent ob-
jections could be seen as little more than a 
ploy to lend specious legitimacy to Mr. 
Trump’s allegations of voter fraud and avoid 
provoking Mr. Trump’s ire. 
E. Mr. Trump Sought to Block the Peaceful 
Transfer of Power 
Mr. Trump’s overall course of conduct em-
bodied the exact kind of behavior that the 
Framers built constitutional protections to 
thwart. The Framers knew that an executive 
who amassed too much power might rep-
licate the abuses of a monarchy. At the Con-
stitutional Convention, James Madison ex-
plained the risks of appointing an execu-
tive—saying ‘‘loss of capacity or corruption 
was more within the compass of probable 
events, and either of them might be fatal to 
the Republic.’’222 An exchange between two 
delegates, William Richardson Davie and 
James Wilson, highlights the importance of 
safeguarding against a corrupt president 
that would cheat to get reelected. Davie 
stated, ‘‘‘[i]f he be not impeachable whilst in 
office, he will spare no efforts or means

whatever to get himself reelected.’ [Davie] 
considered this as an essential security for 
the good behaviour of the Executive.’’223 Wil-
son concurred with Davie ‘‘in the necessity 
of making the Executive impeachable while 
in office.’’224 
Without mechanisms to keep an out-of- 
control president in check, there was little 
binding him to the law. This, in part, 
prompted the Framers to design the system 
of checks and balances and Congress’s Im-
peachment power. Another intentional hall-
mark of our democracy is the peaceful trans-
fer of power, which is especially important 
when an incumbent loses re-election.225 This 
assures that an executive acquires and main-
tains power only through lawful means. It 
also ensures that power is given to a presi-
dent, and taken back, according to the will 
of people. It began when President John 
Adams—defeated by his bitter political rival 
Thomas Jefferson—quietly left the White 
House on the morning of the new president’s 
inauguration.226 Since then, no president has 
ever refused to accept an election result or 
defied the lawful processes for resolving elec-
toral disputes, until Mr. Trump. 
Mr. Trump, unable to accept the will of the 
people, categorically rejected the decision of 
Americans as expressed in the 2020 election. 
Even more than refusing, he repeatedly 
sought to undermine processes at the fed-
eral, state, and local level that would ad-
vance a peaceful transfer of power. As the 
House Managers noted, Mr. Trump tried to 
obstruct the election process through non- 
violent 
means.227
When 
these 
attempts 
failed, he directed a mob to help him wrest 
power by launching an attack on the legisla-
tive branch. 
IX. VIOLATION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS 
One of the key principles rooted in our 
democratic system is the separation of pow-
ers between the co-equal branches of govern-
ment. This is apparent from the way the 
Framers devised a system of federal govern-
ment that diffuses and divides its core func-
tions across the legislative, executive, and 
judicial branches. 
The doctrine is rooted in a political philos-
ophy that aims to keep the government, as a 
whole and each branch, both limited and em-
powered, so that the government can func-
tion effectively, while the branches can pre-
vent one another from acting arbitrarily or 
recklessly. As James Madison explained in 
Federalist Paper Number 47, ‘‘The accumula-
tion of all powers, legislative, executive, and 
judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, 
a few, or many, and whether hereditary, 
selfappointed, or elective, may justly be pro-
nounced the very definition of tyranny.’’228 
Therefore, when any one branch of govern-
ment seeks to obstruct an essential function 
of another branch, it threatens the separa-
tion of powers.229 In a case where a president 
seeks to derogate the authority of another 
branch, it can also undermine the president’s 
constitutional obligation to ‘‘take Care that 
the Laws be faithfully executed.’’230 
In inciting the armed assault on the Cap-
itol on January 6th, Mr. Trump knowingly 
and recklessly threatened a constitutional 
proceeding of the Congress. In all this, Mr. 
Trump gravely endangered the security of 
the United States and its institutions, and 
imperiled a coequal branch of government. 
X. VIOLATION OF OATH OF OFFICE 
Manager Castro outlined the numerous 
ways that Mr. Trump abandoned his post as 
the insurrection began, and even hours after 
it was underway.231 Capitol Police were over-
whelmed and violently assaulted by the 
armed mob. Members of Congress and con-
gressional staff feared for their lives, many 
of them hiding or barricaded in offices, as 
the mob wreaked mayhem on the Capitol 
grounds. It was all unfolding on television, 
leaving little doubt that Mr. Trump saw it 
happening in real time. 
Manager 
Castro 
emphasized 
that 
Mr. 
Trump could have simply told the rioters to 
stop and leave the Capitol.232 As I explained 
in Section VII, Mr. Trump did not acknowl-
edge the attack for nearly two hours, while 
Republican lawmakers and the people closest 
to him implored him to call off the attack. 
Instead, he tweeted out criticism of Vice 
President Pence. When he finally acknowl-
edged the attack, he did not denounce the 
mob or rioters, but asked them to ‘‘stay 
peaceful,’’ even though it was clear that they 
had undertaken an unlawful siege at the 
Capitol. At this time, Mr. Trump still did 
not ask the rioters to stop. Three and half 
hours in, he released a video reaffirming the 
same voter fraud lies, and told his sup-
porters, ‘‘We love you. You’re very special.’’ 
While Mr. Trump did tell the rioters to go 
home this time, he still refused to disavow 
the ongoing attack or the attackers them-
selves. 
In addition to inciting the insurrection, 
Mr. Trump abandoned his duties to defend 
the American people, even after the events of 
the day turned deadly. Manager Castro noted 
that he did not deploy the National Guard, 
nor any other law enforcement.233 He was so 
disengaged from discussions with the Pen-
tagon about deploying the National Guard 
that Vice President Pence had to intervene 
to help move the request forward.234 
Taken together, Mr. Trump’s conduct was 
an astonishing and willful dereliction of 
duty. He had sworn an oath to ‘‘faithfully 
execute the office of President of the United 
States and preserve, protect and defend the 
Constitution of the United States.’’235 Yet on 
that day, he commanded his supporters to 
inflict grave harm to the constitutional 
order, by telling them to disrupt the elec-
toral certification and the peaceful transfer 
of power. He sat back and watched as his 
supporters took part in an attack on the gov-
ernment institutions that he swore to de-
fend. Then, he entirely failed to stop or con-
demn the widespread lawbreaking that his 
supporters took part in. As such, I find that 
there is overwhelmingly clear and con-
vincing evidence that Mr. Trump violated 
his oath of office. 
XI. CONCLUSION: CONVICTION AND DISQUALIFICA-
TION OF MR. TRUMP IS AN APPROPRIATE REM-
EDY 
Conviction and disqualification of a presi-
dent from office requires a high standard and 
should only be arrived at when there are no 
other remedies available. 
First, I would refute several assertions by 
President’s Counsel that the Impeachment 
proceeding, and the remedies thereof, are not 
the appropriate way to hold Mr. Trump ac-
countable for his actions. President’s Coun-
sel and the Senate Minority Leader argue 
that the more proper forum is a criminal 
proceeding because of the criminal implica-
tions of his offenses. Taken to its logical ex-
treme, their views would absurdly mean that 
if a president’s malfeasance could be pros-
ecuted, the president should be protected 
from the Impeachment process. 
In addition, Manager Raskin correctly dif-
ferentiated the purpose and independence of 
the Impeachment process from the prosecu-
tion of crimes. As Manager Raskin stated, 
‘‘[Impeachment] was created to prevent and 
deter elected officials who swear an oath to 
represent America but then commit dan-
gerous offenses against our republic.’’236 An 
Impeachment, unlike a criminal case, is not 
meant to punish the defendant, but to guard 
the country and the Constitution from an 
unfit executive. As I have explained, by his 
conduct, Mr. Trump violated his oath of of-
fice and refused to defend the Constitution 
itself. Therefore, an Impeachment is the 
most appropriate forum to protect the integ-
rity of the presidency and the constitutional 
order. 
President’s Counsel also contend that Im-
peachment is unnecessary in this case be-
cause the 2020 election was the remedy for 
his conduct. Of course, when Mr. Trump in-
cited a mob to violent action at the U.S. 
Capitol, it was an attempt to delay the cer-
tification of the election results. This fol-
lowed months of Mr. Trump’s public refusal 
to concede the election on the grounds that 
it was stolen from him. Clearly, the election 
process is insufficient in this case because 
Mr. Trump does not recognize the validity of 
any election outcome that does not favor 
him. 
Failing to convict the former president 
would result in several constitutional perils. 
First, Mr. Trump may once again run for 
president. If re-elected, there is no reason to 
believe that he would feel constrained by any 
limitations. An acquittal essentially would 
provide him permission to commit the same 
abuses or worse, without fear of account-
ability. That includes leveraging all the pow-
ers of the presidency to stay in power or 
wage an assault on a coequal branch of gov-
ernment. Presidents must be held account-
able when their lust for power does violence 
to bedrock principles. Disqualification from 
public office is the only remedy left to pre-
vent such behavior from Mr. Trump in the 
future. 
A failure to convict would also be a lesson 
to future presidents with authoritarian ten-
dencies that they can attack our democratic 
principles and institutions without con-
sequence. Even beyond a ‘‘January Excep-
tion,’’ a future president might reason that 
otherwise impeachable conduct will not be 
challenged during any part of their presi-
dency. In addition to rank abuse of power, a 
future president may not submit to the 
peaceful transfer of power and the sacred 
will of the people. In terms of the legislative 
branch, Congress would send a message that 
it is unwilling to use its own oversight pow-
ers functionally and effectively, and is un-
willing to uphold a meaningful separation of 
powers. Disqualification is the necessary 
method for protecting the republic from such 
democratic decay within the executive and 
legislative branches. 
This chapter in history reminds us that de-
mocracy is fragile and we must diligently 
safeguard its principles. To this end, I have 
a responsibility to defend the truth, the rule 
of law, and our democratic institutions. I am 
compelled to vote to convict President Don-
ald J. Trump of committing ‘‘high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’ and support his disquali-
fication from ever again holding an office of 
public trust.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the 
Senate was asked to decide whether 
this body has the constitutional juris-
diction to hold an impeachment trial of 
Donald Trump now that he is no longer 
President of the United States. While 
the Constitution does not explicitly ad-
dress Congress’ jurisdiction when the 
subject of impeachment is a former 
President—or any former officer—its 
text and purpose as applied to the facts 
in this matter support the conclusion 
that the trial should proceed. 
The question of Senate jurisdiction 
should start with the text of the Con-
stitution 
itself. 
The 
impeachment 
process is described in article I, which 
delineates the respective powers of the 
House of Representatives and the Sen-
ate. Section 2 plainly states that the 
House ‘‘shall have the sole power of im-
peachment.’’ In this matter, there is no 
dispute that impeachment occurred be-
fore former President Trump’s term ex-
pired, and, therefore, there is no dis-
pute that the House had jurisdiction to 
impeach him. 
What is at issue is whether the im-
peachment trial can occur in the Sen-
ate now that former President Trump 
is no longer in office. Again, I look to 
the text of article I. Section 3 states 
that ‘‘the Senate shall have the sole 
Power to try all Impeachments.’’ As 
former Federal circuit court Judge Mi-
chael McConnell has observed, the key 
word here is ‘‘all.’’ Sections 2 and 3 
read together lead to the inescapable 
conclusion that, if the House presents 
the Senate with a valid impeachment 
article, the Senate has jurisdiction to 
conduct the trial. 
Some have argued that such an inter-
pretation would put all former Presi-
dents, Vice Presidents, and office hold-
ers dating back to the Washington ad-
ministration at risk of being im-
peached and convicted, but the facts in 
this matter do not require such a 
sweeping conclusion. By asserting its 
jurisdiction over this trial, the Senate 
is simply ruling that a President who 
was impeached while still in office can 
be tried after he is no longer in office— 
nothing more. 
The former President’s attorneys 
argue that the Senate does not have ju-
risdiction to conduct a trial because 
the penalty prescribed for conviction

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S939 
March 1, 2021 
under article II, section 4, is removal 
from office. Because former President 
Trump cannot be removed, they argue 
that the Constitution requires he not 
be tried. But article I, section 4, au-
thorizes the Senate to impose the pen-
alty 
of 
permanent 
disqualification 
from holding office in the future if it 
chooses to do so. And, notably, a vote 
on whether or not to disqualify can 
only be taken after conviction, at 
which point any defendant would have 
been removed and no longer an office 
holder. 
If the defense’s argument were to be 
followed to its logical conclusion, it 
would lead to a constitutional absurd-
ity—the Senate would have the sole 
power to apply the disqualification 
penalty, but it would never have juris-
diction to do so. If the Senate were un-
able to consider disqualification after a 
President is no longer in office, the sec-
ond penalty would lose its meaning. A 
more sensible reading of article I, sec-
tion 4, is that both punishments, re-
moval and disqualification, are equally 
significant, and therefore, the Senate 
has jurisdiction in this matter. 
For all the reasons I have set forth, I 
believe that the Senate must exercise 
jurisdiction, and I voted to begin its 
impeachment proceedings. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
statement regarding the impeachment 
trial of the former President be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
STATEMENT ON THE SECOND IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President. The former 
President’s conduct during and after the 2020 
Presidential election was indefensible and 
dangerous. 
By 
inciting 
an 
insurrection 
against Congress and pressuring government 
officials across our Nation to overturn the 
election in his favor, the former President 
directly ‘‘threatened the integrity of the 
democratic 
system, 
interfered 
with 
the 
peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a 
coequal branch of Government.’’1 As long as 
he is able to hold public office under the 
United States, he will remain a grave threat 
to our national security and our Constitu-
tion. For these reasons, I again voted to con-
vict the former President on the House of 
Representatives’ Article of Impeachment. 
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE TRIAL 
As a threshold question in this trial, the 
former President’s legal team and several 
Republican Senators have argued that the 
Senate cannot hold an impeachment trial 
against a President who is no longer in of-
fice.2 This argument is just another conven-
ient excuse for some of my Republican col-
leagues to avoid holding the former Presi-
dent accountable. Not only has the theory 
been roundly rejected by both liberal and 
conservative constitutional legal scholars,3 
it would also completely contravene both 
Senate and historical precedent.4
In this 
case, consistent with the prevailing legal 
theory and historical precedent, the Senate 
voted to affirm the constitutionality of this 
current trial—a decision that I fully sup-
ported.5 Thus, after addressing the threshold 
Constitutional issue, the question before 
every Senator in this trial became twofold— 
(1) did the former President do what he is 
charged with in the Article?; and (2) if so, 
does that action warrant conviction and dis-
qualification from holding future office? 
THE BIG LIE DEBUNKED 
The public record demonstrates clearly 
that the former President engaged in the 
conduct outlined in the Article of Impeach-
ment put forward by the House of Represent-
atives. We watched his actions with our own 
eyes. We heard his conspiracy theories and 
baseless accusations with our own ears. For 
months after the election, all of America 
witnessed the former President’s deliberate 
repetition of the ‘‘Big Lie;’’ he repeatedly 
claimed—without any evidence—that the 
2020 general election was rigged and stolen 
from him.6 In furtherance of this falsehood, 
the former President has made numerous 
claims, all easily and consistently rebutted, 
regarding the votes cast in multiple battle-
ground states. As the Senior Senator from 
Pennsylvania, a state that the former Presi-
dent relentlessly attacked after the election, 
I believe it is important to debunk the nu-
merous false statements that the former 
President asserted regarding the Pennsyl-
vania Presidential election. 
Prior to the election, it was widely re-
ported that the public should ‘‘beware’’ of 
early U.S. election tallies because of the un-
precedented amount of mail-in voting and 
the different ways that states were proc-
essing ballots due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic.7 In Pennsylvania specifically, Demo-
cratic voters were outpacing Republican vot-
ers by a 3–to–1 ratio in mail-in voting.8 Since 
the mail-in votes would be the last to be 
counted in most counties, experts cautioned 
voters that the former President might ap-
pear to be winning in the early returns on 
election night (a ‘‘Red mirage’’) only to lose 
that lead as election officials counted more 
mail-in ballots in the days after Election 
Day (a ‘‘Blue shift’’).9 
Despite these warnings, the former Presi-
dent attempted to sow doubt, even before 
Election Day, about votes counted after No-
vember 3. A week before Election Day, he in-
dicated that ‘‘counting ballots for two 
weeks’’ after Election Day was ‘‘totally inap-
propriate’’ and he did not believe it was con-
sistent with our Nation’s election laws.10 To 
be clear, there is nothing improper or illegal 
about election officials counting legally cast 
votes after Election Day. Nonetheless, as 
election officials in Pennsylvania began to 
process 
the 
heavily 
Democratic-leaning 
mail-in ballots in the days following Elec-
tion Day and the former President’s ‘‘Red 
mirage’’ predictably turned to a ‘‘Blue shift’’ 
in favor of President Biden, the former Presi-
dent claimed that officials were ‘‘finding 
Biden votes all over the place.’’11 In reality, 
election officials in Pennsylvania were sim-
ply counting legally cast votes. As Repub-
lican Philadelphia Commissioner Al Schmidt 
said: ‘‘In the birthplace of our Republic, 
counting votes is not a bad thing. Counting 
votes cast on or before Election Day by eligi-
ble voters is not corruption. It is not cheat-
ing. It is democracy.’’12 
Relatedly, 
the 
former 
President 
also 
claimed that in Pennsylvania, ‘‘tens of thou-
sands of votes were illegally received after 8 
P.M. on Tuesday, Election Day, totally and 
easily changing the results.’’13 Here again, 
the former President was lying. In Sep-
tember 2020, the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court extended the mail-in ballot receipt 
deadline in Pennsylvania by three days be-
cause of the unprecedented circumstances 
caused by the COVID–19 pandemic.14
The 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision did 
not permit eligible voters to vote after Elec-
tion Day. Rather, pursuant to the Free and 
Equal Elections Clause of the Pennsylvania 
Constitution, the court explained that bal-
lots mailed by Election Day could still be 
counted if those ballots were received within 
three days of Election Day.15 In addition to 
lying about whether it was legal to receive 
ballots after Election Day, the former Presi-
dent drastically overinflated the number of 
ballots received after Election Day in Penn-
sylvania. In fact, there were only approxi-
mately ten thousand ballots received after 
Election Day and those ballots were not even 
included in Pennsylvania’s certified election 
results.16 Since President Biden won Penn-
sylvania by over eighty thousand votes, the 
ballots received after Election Day would 
not have made any difference in Pennsylva-
nia’s Presidential election outcome.17 
In another tweet, the former President 
claimed that Pennsylvania prevented his 
campaign officials ‘‘from watching much of 
the Ballot count.’’18 Again, the former Presi-
dent was lying. In fact, in response to a 
judge’s question during one hearing on 
whether there were election observers in the 
canvassing room, a lawyer representing the 
former President offered the seemingly bi-
zarre concession that there was ‘‘a non-zero 
number of people in the room.’’19 Further-
more, multiple courts confirmed that the 
former President’s campaign presented no 
evidence suggesting that his campaign’s ob-
servers were treated any differently than the 
observers for the Biden Campaign.20 
The former President’s lies did not stop 
there. In late November, the former Presi-
dent tweeted that over a million votes in 
Pennsylvania were ‘‘created out of thin 
air.’’21 This is a lie. Here, the former Presi-
dent was referring to a conspiracy theory of-
fered by Republican State Senator Doug 
Mastriano, who claimed that the Pennsyl-
vania Department of State was reporting an 
extra 1.1 million mail-in votes in Pennsyl-
vania.22 Senator Mastriano indicated that 
Pennsylvania 
had 
reported 
mailing 
out 
‘‘1,823,148 ballots, of which 1,462,302 were re-
turned,’’ but he indicated that a dashboard 
on the Department of State’s website re-
corded over 2.5 mail-in ballots in the general 
election.23 While Senator Mastriano did not 
include sources for his data, it was easy to 
determine that he was conflating different 
datasets from the general election and the 
June primaries. A dataset from the Pennsyl-
vania Department of State clearly detailed 
that there were 1,823,148 mail-in ballot re-
quest for the June 2020 primaries24—the 
exact 
number 
that 
Senator 
Mastriano 
cited—while Pennsylvania’s official returns 
for the 2020 general election clearly illus-
trated that over 2.6 million voters cast a bal-
lot by mail in the Presidential election.25 
In another tweet on December 28, the 
former President claimed that there were 
‘‘205,000 more votes than there were voters’’ 
in Pennsylvania.26 This too is another lie. 
Again, the former President appeared to be 
referencing yet another conspiracy theory 
offered by another state legislator, Rep-
resentative Frank Ryan.27
Representative 
Ryan claimed that the official election re-
turns included 205,000 more votes than those 
listed in Pennsylvania’s voter registration 
database.28 Pennsylvania Attorney General 
Josh Shapiro explained that the voter reg-
istration database referenced by Representa-
tive Frank ‘‘is updated by each county indi-
vidually, and this updating process can take 
several weeks following an election.’’29 Thus, 
the Attorney General explained that it ap-
peared that Representative Ryan was com-
paring ‘‘the official returns with incomplete 
data from the registration database to jus-
tify his baseless claim that there were more 
votes than voters.’’30 
Unfortunately, the above lies are merely a 
sampling of the former President’s total lies 
about the election process in Pennsylvania 
and across the Nation. In addition to these

falsehoods, the former President claimed— 
without evidence—that there were ‘‘900,000 
Fraudulent Votes’’ in Pennsylvania,31 that 
Dominion Voting Systems switched 221,000 
votes from the former President to Joe Biden 
in Pennsylvania,32 and that ‘‘Fraud and ille-
gality’’ were a ‘‘big part’’ of his election law-
suits in Pennsylvania.33 
The Pennsylvania election was adminis-
tered safely and securely by thousands of Re-
publican and Democratic election officials 
and selfless volunteers across the Common-
wealth. We know this because as the House 
Managers highlighted in their trial brief, 
‘‘[o]ur legal system affords many ways in 
which a candidate can contest the outcome 
of an election.’’34 The former President did 
not merely contest the election in Pennsyl-
vania, but also in Arizona, Georgia, Michi-
gan, Nevada, and Wisconsin.35 In total, the 
former President and his allies filed 62 law-
suits in state and federal courts regarding 
the 2020 election and they lost every case, ex-
cept for one minor lawsuit in Pennsylvania.36 
Furthermore, despite the President’s pub-
lic claims of widespread illegalities, his legal 
team rarely attempted to allege fraud in his 
lawsuits.37 In fact, his own attorney, Rudy 
Giuliani, explicitly confirmed that the Cam-
paign was not alleging fraud during one high 
profile case in Pennsylvania by stating 
‘‘[t]his is not a fraud case.’’38 Despite these 
facts, the former President continued to 
spread a different narrative—a Big Lie re-
garding a rigged election—on Twitter. 
United States District Court Judge Mat-
thew Brann of the Middle District of Penn-
sylvania highlighted the absurdity of some 
of the former President’s legal arguments in 
an opinion dismissing one of the Campaign’s 
lawsuits: 
‘‘Plaintiffs ask this Court to disenfranchise 
almost seven million voters. . . . One might 
expect that when seeking such a startling 
outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably 
armed with compelling legal arguments and 
factual proof of rampant corruption, such 
that this Court would have no option but to 
regrettably grant the proposed injunctive re-
lief despite the impact it would have on such 
a large group of citizens. That has not hap-
pened. Instead, this Court has been presented 
with strained legal arguments without merit 
and speculative accusations, unpled in the 
operative complaint and unsupported by evi-
dence. In the United States of America, this 
cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a 
single voter, let alone all the voters of its 
sixth most populated state. Our people, laws, 
and institutions demand more.’’39 
In the Campaign’s appeal to the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Third Cir-
cuit, Judge Stephanos Bibas, a judge ap-
pointed by the former President,40 wrote for 
a unanimous panel affirming Judge Brann’s 
initial decision.41 Judge Bibas wrote: ‘‘Free, 
fair elections are the lifeblood of our democ-
racy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But 
calling an election unfair does not make it 
so. Charges require specific allegations and 
then proof. We have neither here.’’42 The 
Presidential election was fair and lawful not-
withstanding the many lies told by the 
former President. 
THE FORMER PRESIDENT’S PATTERN OF 
CONDUCT 
Despite losing case after case in federal 
and state courts, the former President was 
not deterred in his efforts to spread his Big 
Lie regarding a stolen election. Instead, he 
turned his attention to pressuring federal, 
state and local elections officials to overturn 
the election. In Georgia, he personally called 
the Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, 
and told him to ‘‘find 11,780 votes, which is 
one more than we have because we won the 
state.’’43 
He also began an aggressive lobbying cam-
paign against Vice President Pence.44 Pursu-
ant to the Twelfth Amendment, the Vice 
President counts each state’s certified Elec-
toral College votes for President in a joint 
session of Congress.45 However, the former 
President regularly lied about the constitu-
tional duty of the Vice President. In another 
attempt to turn the election in his favor 
through illegitimate means, the former 
President suggested that Vice President 
Pence should violate his oath of office by re-
fusing to count certain electoral votes for 
President Biden during the joint session.46 
After failing to overturn the election 
through the courts and his pressure cam-
paign on other elected officials, the former 
President took aim for one more attack on 
American democracy. He summoned his mob 
of insurrectionists to Washington, D.C. on 
January 6, 2021 for a ‘‘Save America Rally’’ 
to coincide with the joint session of Con-
gress.47 He invited them. He incited them 
over the course of months and on January 6. 
Finally, he directed this Trump mob to the 
Capitol to subvert and obstruct Congress 
from conducting its constitutional obliga-
tion to certify the 2020 Presidential election. 
On January 6, we heard the former Presi-
dent continue to spread his Big Lie at his 
rally. As Attorney General Shapiro detailed, 
the former President ‘‘inflamed the crowd by 
repeating the same debunked allegations 
about voter fraud in Pennsylvania and else-
where. In his remarks, he repeated no fewer 
than eight false statements about Penn-
sylvania’s elections alone.’’ 48 He further in-
cited the mob to ‘‘stop the steal’’ by declar-
ing that ‘‘we fight, we fight like hell,’’ be-
cause ‘‘if you don’t fight like hell you’re not 
going to have a country anymore.’’ 49 
The case for incitement is about far more 
than just the former President’s speech on 
January 6. This was about a pattern of con-
duct. It was about the former President’s 
autocratic leadership and calls for political 
violence throughout his Presidency. It was 
about a President who once bragged: ‘‘I have 
the tough people [supporting me], but they 
don’t play it tough until they go to a certain 
point, and then it would be very bad, very 
bad.’’ 50 
I, as well as public officials in both parties, 
talk about fighting for public policy goals. 
We fight for health care. We fight for civil 
rights. We fight for equity and justice. How-
ever, when the former President tells his 
supporters to fight, it means something dif-
ferent because the former President has reg-
ularly condoned and encouraged violence 
against protestors and members of the press 
since he became a candidate in 2015. As Lead 
House Manager Jamie Raskin told us during 
the trial: ‘‘January 6 was a culmination of 
the President’s actions—not an aberration 
from them.’’51 It was the former President’s 
pattern and practice of condoning and en-
couraging violent action. 
For example, during remarks in October 
2015, the former President—then a can-
didate—indicated that he would be a ‘‘little 
more violent’’ next time protestors inter-
rupted one of his rallies.52
Video later 
showed the former President’s supporters 
forcibly dragging protestors out of the cam-
paign event.53 In a February 2016 rally in 
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, we saw the former Presi-
dent tell his supporters to ‘‘knock the hell’’ 
out of protestors and then promised to pay 
their legal fees resulting from any alterca-
tion.54 
In March 2016, a supporter of the former 
President sucker punched a Black man being 
escorted out of a campaign rally.55
The 
former President’s supporter was later re-
corded as saying ‘‘[t]he next time we see 
him, we might have to kill him.’’ 56 Just days 
later, the former President defended those at 
his rallies assaulting protestors by calling 
their actions ‘‘very, very appropriate.’’ 57 In 
another 2016 rally in Las Vegas, the former 
President commented that he would like to 
‘‘punch [a protestor] in the face’’ before 
reminiscing about the fictional ‘‘old days’’ 
when violent behavior was allegedly more 
acceptable.58 ‘‘You know what they used to 
do to guys like that when they were in a 
place like this?’’ he asked the crowd. 
‘‘They’d be carried out on a stretcher, 
folks.’’59 
This abhorrent behavior did not change 
when the former President entered office. In 
August 2017, after a rally of white suprema-
cists resulted in three deaths and more than 
33 other injuries in Charlottesville, Virginia, 
the former President offered perhaps the 
most disturbing comments of his Presidency 
when he suggested that there was ‘‘blame on 
both sides’’ and that there were ‘‘very fine 
people on both sides.’’60 In October 2018, we 
saw the former President praise and glorify 
the actions of current Governor of Montana, 
Greg 
Gianforte, 
after 
then-candidate 
Gianforte had body slammed and hospital-
ized a journalist in May 2017.61 Mr. Gianforte 
had already pled guilty to the assault.62 
In 2020, the former President further glori-
fied violence by indicating that ‘‘when the 
looting starts, the shooting starts’’ in rela-
tion to the civil rights protests occurring 
after George Floyd’s murder at the hands of 
law 
enforcement 
in 
Minneapolis, 
Min-
nesota.63 Later, we saw the former President 
direct federal agents to forcibly move hun-
dreds of peaceful protestors outside of the 
White House so he could pose for a photo op 
in front of St. John’s Church in Washington, 
D.C.64 
In April 2020, in what turned out to be a 
dress rehearsal for the January 6 insurrec-
tion, we saw the former President tweet 
‘‘LIBERATE MICHIGAN!’’ after the Gov-
ernor of Michigan implemented several miti-
gation measures to address the COVID–19 
public health crisis.65
Nearly two weeks 
later, on April 30, armed protestors dressed 
in tactical gear sieged the Michigan State 
Capitol, waving the Confederate flag and 
wearing MAGA hats.66 Rather than condemn 
those who had seized the state capitol wav-
ing Confederate flags, the former President 
encouraged the Governor of Michigan to ne-
gotiate with them: ‘‘The Governor of Michi-
gan should give a little, and put out the fire. 
These are very good people, but they are 
angry. They want their lives back again, 
safely! See them, talk to them, make a 
deal.’’67 Just a few months following the cap-
itol siege in Michigan, the FBI arrested thir-
teen men for ‘‘plotting to storm the Michi-
gan State capitol building, launch a civil 
war, kidnap Governor Whitmer, transport 
her to Wisconsin, and then try and execute 
her.’’ 68 
The former President’s pattern of conduct 
is indisputable. A reasonable person cannot 
dispute that the former President knew ex-
actly what he was doing by perpetuating the 
‘‘Big Lie,’’ summoning his crowd of insurrec-
tionists on January 6 and telling them: ‘‘[I]f 
you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to 
have a country anymore.’’ 69
The former 
President led his supporters to a breaking 
point and as he had predicted in the past—it 
was ‘‘very bad, very bad.’’ 70 There is simply 
no way to excuse the former President’s ac-
tions in this case. 
AN ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY 
By encouraging his mob of insurrectionists 
to march on the Capitol and obstruct the 
Congressional certification of the 2020 elec-
tion, the former President attacked the 
foundational principles of our democracy 
and the peaceful transfer of power. He did 
not merely endanger another branch of gov-
ernment and the Presidential line of succes-
sion. His actions led to at least five deaths,

injuries to nearly 140 members of law en-
forcement and untold collateral damage re-
sulting from the carnage of that day.71 He 
endangered the lives of countless Congres-
sional staffers and employees, members of 
the press and members of Congress. He put a 
target on the back of his own Vice President 
and his Vice President’s family. His actions 
jeopardized our Nation’s national security by 
tarnishing the United States’ reputation 
abroad and emboldening violent extremists 
at home. 
Furthermore, he has shown absolutely no 
remorse for any of it, even going as far to 
glorify the insurrection in the immediate 
aftermath of the attack. After the Capitol 
had been secured in the early evening of Jan-
uary 6 and Congress was making plans to re-
sume its joint session, the former President 
turned to Twitter to release a statement. He 
did not denounce the violent insurrection, 
but rather he chose to continue to spread his 
Big Lie that the election was stolen from 
him and to call the insurrectionists ‘‘great 
patriots:’’ 
‘‘These are the things and events that hap-
pen when a sacred landslide election victory 
is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped 
away from great patriots who have been 
badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go 
home with love & in peace. Remember this 
day forever.’’ 72 
Ultimately, after carefully reviewing all of 
the evidence put forward in this case, I found 
that the House Managers more than exceed-
ed their burden of proof. The former Presi-
dent’s conduct violated his oath of office, en-
dangered our democracy and jeopardized the 
United States’ national security. Through 
this conduct, the former President com-
mitted a high crime against our Constitu-
tion. I voted to convict him in the most bi-
partisan 
Presidential 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings in our Nation’s history.73

Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as 
Senators in this proceeding, we were 
bound by two oaths, to support and de-
fend the Constitution and to pursue 
impartial justice as we considered the 
Article of Impeachment filed against 
former President Donald Trump: a 
charge of incitement of insurrection. 
The Framers of our Constitution 
gave us the tools to respond to a mo-
ment like this. Having lived under the 
tyranny of an unaccountable King, 
they were well aware of the risks of a 
President willing to abuse his or her 
power. William Davie, one of North 
Carolina’s representatives at the Con-
stitutional Convention, argued that 
empowering the Congress was nec-
essary to protect against the threat of 
a President who would spare ‘‘no ef-
forts or means whatever to get himself 
reelected.’’ 
Our system of checks and balances as 
laid out in our Constitution provides 
that the Congress can impeach a Presi-
dent for committing ‘‘Treason, Brib-
ery, or other High Crimes and Mis-
demeanors.’’ The phrase was meant to 
encompass any offenses that, as Alex-
ander Hamilton explained in Federalist 
65, include an ‘‘abuse or violation of 
some public trust’’ and ‘‘injuries done 
immediately to society itself.’’ Im-
peachment is a remedy for this public 
harm. 
Some of my colleagues argue that 
the Senate could not sit as a court of 
impeachment for a former President. 
But 
constitutional 
scholars 
from 
across the political spectrum agree 
that the plain language of the Con-
stitution and the historical precedent 
are clear that the Senate has the power 
to hold former officers accountable for 
offenses committed while in office. The 
question was debated on the Senate 
floor, we had a vote, and a bipartisan 
majority decided that we should pro-
ceed. As Manager JAMIE RASKIN said, 
‘‘[t]he 
jurisdictional 
constitutional 
issue is gone . . . We are having a trial 
on the facts.’’ 
As we were all witnesses to what hap-
pened on January 6, the facts are clear. 
During the trial, we saw evidence that 
was haunting and chilling. But more 
than that, collectively, the evidence 
presented a clear indictment of Presi-
dent Trump’s role in threatening not 
only the lives of those at the Capitol, 
but the very lifeblood of our democ-
racy. 
President Trump’s actions on Janu-
ary 6 were consistent with a years-long 
effort to undermine faith in our demo-
cratic system. After spending months 
trying to delegitimize our elections 
and despite losing by more than 7 mil-
lion votes, President Trump filed doz-
ens of lawsuits and called into question 
the election results across the country. 
In court after court, the President’s 
claims were rejected. As Judge Bibas, 
who 
was 
appointed 
by 
President 
Trump, wrote for the Third Circuit, 
‘‘Charges of unfairness are serious. But 
calling an election unfair does not 
make it so. Charges require specific al-
legations and then proof. We have nei-
ther here.’’ 
In an attempt to delay the certifi-
cation of the results, President Trump 
privately pressured State election offi-
cials, including asking Georgia’s Sec-
retary of State to ‘‘find’’ 11,780 votes, a 
number that would flip the State in his 
favor. Thankfully, election officials 
followed the law, and by December 11, 
2020, all States had certified the results 
of the election. 
Despite the results being final, how-
ever, President Trump convinced his 
supporters that there was one last op-
portunity to interrupt the peaceful 
transfer of power: preventing the Con-
gress from counting the electoral col-
lege votes. And they responded to his 
call. During the trial, we saw a video of 
a rioter yelling, ‘‘We were invited by 
the President of the United States!’’ 
and examples of the rioters’ social 
media posts telling President Trump 
they were there for him, including a 
photo of rioters storming the Capitol 
steps captioned, ‘‘This is me.’’ 
Law enforcement, sworn to protect 
the Capitol, were repeatedly assaulted 
defending our temple of democracy and 
our very republic. We will never forget 
the shrieks of the police officer pinned 
in between the doors at the hands of 
the rioters, pleading for help. We will 
never forget Officer Harry Dunn, who 
fought against the violent mob for 
hours and, after it was over, broke 
down in tears, telling fellow officers he 
had been called the N-word numerous 
times that day. He asked: ‘‘Is this 
America?’’ Or Officer Eugene Goodman 
who ran to take on a growing group of 
the rioters by himself, diverting them 
away from the Senate Chamber and al-
lowing Senators to move to a secure lo-
cation. 
Tragically, the attack on the Capitol 
also cost the lives of three brave offi-
cers, including Officer Brian Sicknick 
who died from injuries sustained while 
engaging with rioters. Two other offi-
cers died by suicide following the 
events of January 6: D.C. Metropolitan 
Police Officer Jeffrey Smith and U.S. 
Capitol 
Police 
Officer 
Howard 
Liebengood. 
While much of the trial rightfully fo-
cused on what President Trump did on 
and leading up to January 6, in many 
ways what he did not do was even more 
dangerous. After he sent the mob to 
the Capitol, putting law enforcement

March 1, 2021 
in danger and threatening the safety of 
the Vice President, President Trump 
did nothing to stop the violence. De-
spite calls from Republican leaders 
across the country, President Trump 
did not even send a tweet to defend our 
democracy. Hours after the rioters first 
breached the Capitol, he finally re-
leased a video and told the rioters: ‘‘we 
love you; you’re very special.’’ 
President Trump betrayed his oath of 
office to preserve, protect, and defend 
the Constitution of the United States. 
He incited a mob to attack the Capitol 
and prevent the peaceful transfer of 
power, and for that, he should be im-
peached. 
On January 6, we were all awakened 
to our responsibilities as Americans 
and as Senators. I will never forget 
walking to the House Chamber around 
4 a.m., with shattered glass from bro-
ken windows strewn in the hallway, 
joined by Senator BLUNT, Vice Presi-
dent Pence, and alongside two young 
women who carried the mahogany 
boxes holding each State’s electoral 
votes. We knew we had to return to do 
our jobs, and that night, we made clear 
to all: Democracy will prevail. 
Thank you. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, on 
January 6, 2021, the heart of American 
democracy was attacked by a violent 
mob seeking to stop the counting of 
electoral votes in Congress and the 
peaceful 
transition 
of 
power. 
The 
peaceful transition of power is the hall-
mark of any healthy democracy and 
the foundation of our government by 
the people. That tradition has endured 
in our country since the ‘‘Revolution of 
1800’’ when John Adams lost his elec-
tion to Thomas Jefferson, marking the 
first peaceful change of Executive 
party in the United States. Years later, 
Jefferson would write about the ‘‘Revo-
lution of 1800’’ and say, ‘‘for that was 
as real a revolution in the principles of 
our government as that of 76 . . . not 
effected indeed by the sword . . . but 
by the rational and peaceable instru-
ment of reform, the suffrage of the peo-
ple.’’ Sadly, the attack on the Capitol 
was an attempt to return to the 
‘‘sword,’’ and it was incited by the 
President of the United States. 
Donald Trump’s actions leading up to 
and on January 6 demonstrated what I 
believed following his first impeach-
ment: He was unfit for the Presidency 
and betrayed his oath to faithfully exe-
cute the office of President and pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitu-
tion. Donald Trump engaged in a 
months-long campaign of lies and mis-
information about voter fraud in the 
2020 election to mislead the American 
people and maintain power. This cam-
paign was waged with a singular pur-
pose: to overturn a free and fair elec-
tion through any means necessary. It 
included calls to State election offi-
cials in Georgia where he urged them 
to ‘‘find votes’’ that would allow him 
to win the State; wild conspiracy theo-
ries that voting machines had been 
rigged against him; and baseless law-
suits that were rejected more than 60 
times by Federal courts at all levels. 
This insidious effort culminated at the 
‘‘Save America’’ rally on January 6 
when the former President urged his 
supporters to ‘‘fight like hell’’ and di-
rected them to march on Congress 
where the counting of electoral votes 
had begun. 
The House Managers presented a de-
tailed timeline of the former Presi-
dent’s actions before, during, and after 
the election that exposed his effort to 
subvert the Constitution and defy the 
will of the American people. The evi-
dence presented against the former 
President demonstrated that he sought 
to undermine and ultimately overturn 
the results of the 2020 election. It 
showed that when his challenges in 
court had failed and the electoral re-
sults had been certified, he turned his 
attention and all the power of the Pres-
idency to January 6. He encouraged his 
supporters to come to DC to ‘‘stop the 
steal’’ and pressured former Vice Presi-
dent Pence to assert power he did not 
have under the Constitution to over-
turn the election. Trump amassed a 
crowd of individuals waiting for his di-
rection, including armed individuals 
who had planned an attack for weeks 
in response to the President’s claims 
that the election was stolen. 
The former President’s actions had 
deadly and destructive consequences. 
Insurrectionists stormed the Capitol 
building, desecrating the seat of Amer-
ican Government and the physical 
manifestation of freedom for people 
across the world. The insurrectionists 
viciously beat police officers defending 
our democracy, vandalized the build-
ing, and terrorized those inside. All the 
while, the mob chanted ‘‘hang Mike 
Pence,’’ ‘‘President Trump sent us’’ 
and ‘‘traitor, traitor, traitor.’’ When 
the attack was over, hundreds of police 
officers and others were injured, and 
five people were dead, including a 
brave Capitol police officer who lost 
his life defending our Capitol. The at-
tack was viewed across the world and 
has undeniably tarnished America’s 
reputation as a beacon of freedom and 
democracy. 
What was the former President’s re-
sponse to this treasonous attack on our 
constitutional process? It was to repeat 
the sinister lies that had led to the at-
tack in the first place and refer to the 
insurrectionists as ‘‘great patriots’’ 
whom he loved. The House Managers 
showed that the President could have 
stopped the attack, but he chose in-
stead to continue his effort to obstruct 
the counting of the electoral votes. Ac-
cording to the testimony of Congress-
woman HERRERA BEUTLER submitted to 
evidence, the former President re-
sponded to House Minority Leader 
KEVIN MCCARTHY’s pleas for help by 
saying, ‘‘Well, KEVIN, I guess these peo-
ple (the insurrectionists) are more 
upset about the election than you are.’’ 
These are not the actions of a Presi-
dent trying to defend the Constitution 
and uphold his oath of office; they are 
the actions of an individual intent on 
retaining power by any means nec-
essary. 
The actions of Donald Trump before, 
during, and after the attack on the 
Capitol reflected our Constitution’s 
Framers greatest fear that a president 
would do anything to retain power con-
trary to the will of the people. They 
knew well the dangers of a despot and 
the capacity of power to corrupt the 
Republic they had established. That is 
why I voted to convict the former 
President to protect our system of gov-
ernment from those who would use 
their office to undermine our Constitu-
tion. Senate precedent, history, and 
tradition clearly demonstrate that a 
former President could be convicted 
having been impeached by the House 
while still in office. 
The former President’s legal team 
made no persuasive argument as to 
how his remarks on January 6 would be 
considered protected speech under the 
First Amendment or why he could not 
be convicted as a former President. As 
House Manager RASKIN said during his 
argument, ‘‘if this is not impeachable 
conduct then what is?’’ I believe it fits 
squarely within the high crimes and 
misdemeanors identified as an eligible 
offense for impeachment in the Con-
stitution. Thus, I exercised my respon-
sibility as a juror to vote to convict 
and ensure that the actions of the 
former President would not go un-
checked. 
Donald Trump betrayed his oath of 
office and he betrayed the American 
people. His actions must not go unan-
swered. The oath that I took and my 
allegiance to it require that I preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution by 
voting to convict a former President 
whose zealous pursuit of unchecked 
power will forever be remembered as 
one of the darkest days in American 
history. As a U.S. Senator, I will con-
tinue to take a stand against actions 
that violates the fundamental norms 
and ideals of American democracy. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, for the 
second time in over a year, events com-
pelled the Senate to hold an impeach-
ment 
trial 
for 
President 
Donald 
Trump. By once more acquitting the 
President despite overwhelming evi-
dence of his guilt, the Senate has again 
abdicated its responsibility to the 
American people and our democratic 
Republic. 
The Founders fashioned our constitu-
tional system to at once defy history 
and reflect its enduring lessons. They 
understood that since the first human 
societies, rule of the strong had pre-
vailed across ages of warlords, mon-
archs, emperors, and tyrants. From the 
examples of ancient Greece and Rome, 
they also knew that rule by the people 
was the fragile, flickering exception. 
To ignite America’s experiment in 
self-government, the Founders handed 
us a constitutional system unique in 
human history, with inalienable rights 
for the people, free and fair democratic 
elections, the rule of law, and coequal

March 1, 2021 
branches of government to check the 
unbridled ambitions that risked drag-
ging us into tyranny. Our system was 
never perfect—far from it—but over 234 
years, Americans have fought and sac-
rificed to make it more democratic, 
more fair, and more free. 
The Founders also understood that, 
however well-crafted the Constitution 
may be, its fate would inevitably de-
pend on the public officials sworn to 
protect it. They could give the Senate 
the unique power to convict a Presi-
dent, but they could not guarantee 
Senators would exercise that power 
when the moment required it. 
Their fears were realized on February 
13, 2021, when the Senate failed to con-
vict President Trump, a man who de-
fied every standard of conduct and de-
cency the Founders expected of public 
officials. 
Months before Americans cast their 
ballots, Donald Trump made our de-
mocracy 
his 
enemy—manufacturing 
false claim after false claim to under-
mine the 2020 election. He warned the 
election would be stolen or rigged, dead 
people would vote, and voting ma-
chines were not trustworthy. He re-
peated these claims incessantly on so-
cial media, at his rallies, and in inter-
view after interview on cable news. He 
repeats these lies to this day. 
When Donald Trump lost the election 
by over 7 million votes, he refused to 
concede. Instead, he waged a months- 
long war against the peaceful transi-
tion of power. First, he challenged the 
election results in court. He lost 61 out 
of the 62 cases, often being howled out 
of court by Federal judges, many ap-
pointed by the President, for failing to 
produce any evidence of widespread 
fraud. Former Attorney General Wil-
liam Barr, one of the President’s most 
steadfast allies, confirmed that there 
was no such evidence. 
So the President changed course. He 
threw the weight of his office against 
State and local officials hoping he 
could coerce them into overturning 
their States’ lawfully conducted elec-
tion. He called election officials in 
Wayne County, MI. He summoned 
State senators from Michigan and 
Pennsylvania to the White House to 
urge the legislature to intervene. His 
aides hounded the Governor of Arizona 
to echo the President’s baseless claims 
about the election. Most notoriously, 
he browbeat Georgia Secretary of State 
Brad Raffensperger in a recorded phone 
call to ‘‘find’’ another 11,780 Trump 
votes and badgered the Vice President 
to reject the certification of the elec-
toral results. In my view, these actions 
alone warranted impeachment. But he 
didn’t stop there. 
In the end, President Trump stopped 
at nothing. As Congress gathered on 
January 6 to certify the electoral col-
lege results, he incited a mob to invade 
the Capitol and ‘‘stop the steal.’’ They 
scaled, as if it were an enemy rampart, 
the platform built for President-elect 
Biden’s inauguration and the peaceful 
transition of power. They chanted 
President 
Trump’s 
name 
as 
they 
smashed doors, broke windows, and 
looted private offices. They repeated 
the President’s lies as they cursed, 
speared, and bludgeoned the men and 
women of law enforcement who de-
fended our democracy. 
At virtually every step of the way, 
our constitutional system held its 
ground because patriotic Americans 
fulfilled their obligation to our Repub-
lic. From the Capitol Police to the non-
partisan election officials, to the State 
and Federal judges, to the Vice Presi-
dent of the United States—all refused 
to bend to the President’s lawless de-
mands. We should shudder to think 
how events would have unfolded if 
these Americans had made a different 
choice. 
Yet somehow, confronted with these 
examples of individual patriotism and 
the 
overwhelming 
evidence 
of 
the 
President’s impeachable offenses, 43 
Senators still voted to acquit, includ-
ing the Senator minority leader, MITCH 
MCCONNELL. 
The minority leader refused to con-
test the case laid out by the House 
managers. He conceded that President 
Trump was ‘‘practically and morally 
responsible for provoking the events’’ 
of January 6, committing what he 
called ‘‘a disgraceful dereliction of 
duty.’’ Instead, the Senator hid behind 
a strained reading of history and 
dodged his duty to hold President 
Trump 
accountable 
on 
the 
feeble 
ground that the Senate lacked jurisdic-
tion. Through this sophist sleight of 
hand, the minority leader tried to 
place one foot on the right side of his-
tory without taking the hard vote it 
actually required. In doing so, he pro-
vided cover to every Republican Sen-
ator who joined him to acquit Presi-
dent Trump, including many who have 
failed to denounce the former Presi-
dent for anything he has done to under-
mine American democracy. 
The Constitution grants the legisla-
tive branch authority to hold account-
able any President who would seek to 
undo our democratic system of govern-
ment. This Senate’s refusal to exercise 
this authority and convict Donald 
Trump is a stain on this body. We had 
the responsibility to serve as a check 
on his anti-American actions and re-
assert the standard of government our 
Founders imagined. We chose other-
wise. 
With the permission of the Senate’s 
acquittal, Donald Trump refuses to 
admit his defeat and continues to mis-
lead his supporters that the election 
was stolen. In so doing, he continues to 
perpetuate, in another form, the insur-
rection he unleashed on January 6. 
Our democracy stands today, not as a 
result of our actions, but those of law 
enforcement officials at the Capitol 
and State and local officials in Michi-
gan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, 
and Wisconsin—men and women who 
didn’t surrender to President Trump’s 
tyrannical demands. 
Nearly 2 months later, the U.S. Cap-
itol remains ringed with razor-wire. As 
I have walked through the perimeter 
each morning, I have reflected on those 
who kept us safe from the President’s 
anti-democratic mob—the law enforce-
ment officials, the people who main-
tain and clean the Capitol, congres-
sional staff. They risked life and limb, 
not only to defend Senators and Rep-
resentatives but to defend basic Amer-
ican principles of our constitutional 
order: free elections, the peaceful tran-
sition of power, the rule of law, and the 
separation of coequal branches of gov-
ernment. 
And then I think about the State and 
local officials, many Republicans, who 
held their ground under pressure from 
the President of the United States, 
often accompanied by threats from 
angry citizens caught up in his ‘‘Big 
Lie’’ that an election he lost by over 7 
million votes was somehow stolen from 
him. These brave men and women did 
their duty to protect our constitu-
tional system. 
They are true patriots no different 
than the millions of other citizens who 
have done their part to defend the way 
of life we share under our Constitution. 
They join the African-American regi-
ments who defended the Union in the 
Civil War, the code talkers in World 
War II, and the sons and daughters of 
immigrants who have defended our 
country from Yorktown to Normandy 
to Kandahar. 
The 
Constitution 
of 
the 
United 
States is not a machine that runs 
itself; it is an exercise in self-govern-
ment. 
American 
citizens—including 
those elected to serve them in the Sen-
ate—must keep it working and always 
ensure that it becomes more demo-
cratic, more fair, and more free. 
As Americans, we should take com-
fort that there have been many, from 
Frederick Douglass and Susan B. An-
thony to the other courageous citizens 
who rose to moments far more difficult 
than our own to protect the Republic 
and push it closer still to our highest 
ideals. 
They are why the United States re-
mains, for now, the longest lasting gov-
ernment by the people in human his-
tory. But as the Founders understood, 
democracy will always be vulnerable to 
demagogues who stop at nothing to 
hold on to power. History will record 
the names of those who stood on the 
side of the Constitution, passing down 
to the next generation the high stand-
ard of citizenship our democracy de-
mands. Hopefully, a future Senate will 
meet that standard. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
in this impeachment trial, every Sen-
ator was a juror, but also a witness and 
victim of the violent insurrection Don-
ald Trump incited. The case was 
straightforward. 
Former 
President 
Trump instigated an armed riot seek-
ing to overthrow a lawful election and 
possibly even injure or assassinate 
elected officials. 
I spent most of my career enforcing 
laws, including two decades as Con-
necticut’s attorney general. In this

role, I learned the power and the sig-
nificance 
of 
accountability. 
When 
wrongdoers enjoy impunity for their 
actions, they and others like them are 
emboldened. 
The 
first 
time 
former 
President 
Trump was impeached by the House, he 
had pressured a foreign government to 
corrupt the American election process, 
extorting a vulnerable, fledgling de-
mocracy to help him cheat in a Presi-
dential election. 
This time, former President Trump’s 
attack on American democracy was 
more direct and violent. The insurrec-
tionists forced us to flee for our lives, 
to place desperate, seemingly final 
calls to loved ones. A Capitol police of-
ficer died protecting us. 
I have the same fear now, only great-
er, that I felt at the close of former 
President Trump’s last impeachment. 
By again refusing to hold former Presi-
dent Trump accountable, the Senate is 
paving the way for another would-be 
tyrant to break laws and norms to re-
tain power. 
We in the Senate are obligated to up-
hold our oaths to support and defend 
the Constitution against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic. Our oaths obli-
gate us to hold former President 
Trump to account for his incitement of 
a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol, 
the symbol of American democracy 
around the world. 
The case against Donald Trump was 
proven convincingly with videos and 
voice recordings so powerful that this 
printed word can never capture their 
force. The former President’s offense in 
this case is as dangerous as it is 
straightforward. He spent months of 
his Presidency telling and retelling the 
‘‘Big Lie.’’ The lie that no matter how 
the American people voted at the bal-
lot box, he was the only legitimate 
winner of the 2020 Presidential elec-
tion. That the election was stolen from 
him, that anyone who disagrees is un- 
American, a traitor. 
As Manager LIEU explained at trial, 
at a certain point in his efforts to un-
dermine the 2020 election, ‘‘Trump ran 
out of non-violent options to retain 
power.’’ 
Donald 
Trump 
encouraged, 
emboldened, and even helped build a 
mob of violent extremists that he in-
vited to Washington, DC, and incited to 
storm the Capitol. While some Mem-
bers of Congress were serving the 
former President in seeking to subvert 
American democracy by objecting to 
vote counting, Trump was imploring 
the mob to do the same. He told sup-
porters to ‘‘never give up’’ on the ‘‘Big 
Lie.’’ He told them that ‘‘this election 
was stolen from you, from me, from the 
country.’’ He said, ‘‘if you don’t fight, 
you are not going to have a country 
anymore.’’ He told the insurrectionists 
to go to the Capitol, and he even lied to 
them that he would be going with 
them. 
The resulting violence, clearly fore-
seeable, was horrifying. They marched 
to the Capitol. Rioters broke windows 
and breached the building. They killed 
a 42-year-old Capitol Hill police officer 
and Air Force veteran, Brian Sicknick. 
They did stop the vote counting, if 
only temporarily. They injured many. 
Members of Congress removed con-
gressional pins to avoid identification 
from the mob. Senators ran from the 
Senate Chamber. They ran for their 
lives. Rioters flew a Confederate flag, a 
symbol of hate that did not fly in the 
Capitol even at the height of the Civil 
War. 
Donald Trump watched this deadly 
attack unfold with glee from the Oval 
Office. On national TV, he told the in-
surrectionists that he loved them. ‘‘I 
know you’re hurt,’’ he consoled the ri-
oters. ‘‘We love you. You’re very spe-
cial.’’ He did not lift a finger to help 
anyone threatened with violence, in-
cluding his Vice President. 
As a result of former Donald Trump’s 
incitement, an angry mob stormed the 
Capitol with every intent to harm 
elected officials and disrupt the peace-
ful transfer of power. Not only has the 
world lost Brian Sicknick, two other 
Capitol Police officers have died by sui-
cide. Several members of the mob were 
killed. 
The Senate’s failure to convict in-
creases the specter of another would-be 
tyrant, as well as Donald Trump, seek-
ing again to mobilize a mob to over-
throw democracy. Violent extremism 
has been emboldened. It is a present, 
immediate danger. 
My colleagues know that former 
President Trump lost the 2020 Presi-
dential election. They know that more 
than 60 courts tossed out his attempts 
to drum up baseless allegations of 
voter fraud. They know that the direc-
tor of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, a lifelong Repub-
lican, certified the election was safe 
and secure. And they know that former 
President Trump incited the insurrec-
tionists to attack the Capitol on Janu-
ary 6. 
Democracy is not our default state of 
being. Democracy thrives only so long 
as the institutions that support it 
thrive. And democratic institutions 
will only thrive and persist through 
hard work, active work, dedicated 
work of our elected officials. For 4 
years, former President Trump con-
tinuously attacked our basic norms 
and institutions of democracy. For 4 
years, he normalized chaos. Our job 
now—Republicans, 
Democrats, 
Inde-
pendents—is to restore. We must dedi-
cate ourselves to restoring the rule of 
law, the protections of rights, and the 
integrity of institutions. And that task 
starts with accountability for all those 
who perpetrated the damage. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today regarding the second impeach-
ment of Donald Trump. 
The House managers made their case. 
Based on the evidence they presented 
and the events we all experienced, Don-
ald Trump should be convicted and pro-
hibited for holding office ever again for 
inciting a violent insurrection at the 
U.S. Capitol on January 6. 
Through video, pictures, and quotes, 
they outlined how the President of the 
United States engaged in a months- 
long campaign to discredit the legiti-
mate election results of the 2020 elec-
tion—a deranged campaign that began 
before a single vote was cast. 
This unprecedented campaign of mis-
information, pushing the ‘‘Big Lie,’’ in-
fected a significant contingent of the 
President’s supporters. They came to 
Washington, DC, at Trump’s invitation 
and inciteful rhetoric. They followed 
his direction on January 6 to storm the 
Capitol and tried to stop us from car-
rying out our constitutional duty to 
certify the election for the lawful win-
ner of the Presidential election, Joe 
Biden. 
The evidence presented by the man-
agers is solid and irrefutable, and the 
President’s lawyers made almost no ef-
fort to try. Given the jury they were 
facing, I don’t blame them. Almost 
every Senator in this Chamber was 
there 
that 
day. 
Senators 
OSSOFF, 
WARNOCK, and PADILLA weren’t sworn 
in until January 20. We all experienced 
the unthinkable that day, and we are 
all processing it differently. The vio-
lent insurrection shook many of us to 
the core. For some of us, the events of 
that day were so chaotic that the full 
magnitude of what was happening 
wasn’t clear at the time. 
Both as part of the trial evidence and 
through interviews and statements, we 
have learned more fully the measure of 
danger we faced as Donald Trump’s 
murderous mob assaulted the Capitol 
campus. The managers’ case and other 
media has given us all a better picture 
of the terror. 
There are stories of bravery, like 
that of Officer Eugene Goodman and 
his U.S. Capitol Police colleagues. 
The footage of Officer Goodman 
misdirecting 
the 
mob 
marauding 
through these halls is remarkable. Put 
yourself in his shoes. How many of us 
would have acted as quickly in the face 
of a rushing wave of hate? He has 
rightly been commended for his deci-
sive, nearly superhuman response. All 
across the complex, his colleagues bat-
tled with insurrectionists who as-
saulted them with bats, bear spray, and 
other weapons in close quarters—these 
were scenes from a war zone, not the 
heart of the U.S. Government. While 
their bravery is commendable, Capitol 
Police and the other law enforcement 
agencies that eventually assisted to re-
store order should never have been in 
that position. But for the President of 
the United States sending a mob of vio-
lent insurrectionists to the Capitol, 
they would not have. 
There are other chilling stories that 
should make every American’s heart 
race. The audio of the Speaker’s staff 
barricaded in their office, whispering 
into the phone, voices trembling, beg-
ging for help. The silent Capitol secu-
rity footage showing just how close the 
Vice President, Senators, Representa-
tives, and staff came to harm. The vid-
eos of chanting, gleeful, rioters dem-
onstrating their horrifying fealty to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S946 
March 1, 2021 
Donald Trump’s lies as they broke 
down doors and ransacked offices and 
the Senate floor. The story that my 
friend Senator MURRAY
has told of 
being trapped in her office with her 
husband. The mob pounding on the 
door while he tried to hold it shut with 
his foot. The absolute terror she must 
have felt hoping that the door was 
locked and that help would come 
quickly. They were inches away. The 
rest of us there that day were at least 
feet away. I am sure that we all called, 
texted, and thought of loved ones. Try-
ing to reassure them but not actually 
knowing if that was true. Feeling from 
far away their helpless anguish for us 
and the utter terror and disbelief that 
something like this could happen in 
our country. To the U.S. Capitol, of all 
places. 
The U.S. Capitol is the heart of our 
democratic 
system 
of 
government. 
While we may disagree vociferously, 
debate passionately, and represent peo-
ple and communities with deeply diver-
gent views, Congress exists to find 
common ground without resorting to 
violence. This simple fact—that as a 
country we solve our problems through 
democratic institutions and debate—is 
a source of our strength and global 
leadership. I have strong disagreements 
with a number of my colleagues. I 
know many of them disagree with me. 
But each day we come to the Senate 
floor and voice those disagreements 
without fear for our safety. On January 
6, that basic level of understanding— 
the very thing that separates our coun-
try from so many others—was shat-
tered by the assault on the Capitol. 
And worst of all, that insurrection was 
incited by a sitting President of the 
United States. 
In some respects, it is difficult to 
know how best to move forward from 
that awful day. We came back. We did 
our jobs. And we are still here doing 
what our constituents sent us here to 
do. The Capitol may have been changed 
indelibly for many of us. 
Again, to turn to the words of my 
friend Senator MURRAY the bipartisan 
actions shown in Congress in the wake 
of the September 11 attacks helped to 
restore some semblance of safety and 
security. That common response is ab-
sent today. 
To begin to heal, we need account-
ability. We need to live up to our con-
stitutional oaths and the sacred duty 
our constituents bestowed on us when 
we were elected: to uphold the law, to 
stand for their values, and, when nec-
essary, to stand for our own. We can 
only start to heal when we have ac-
countability and justice for what hap-
pened. To achieve this, we need those 
who are in leadership positions to lead. 
Republicans failed to lead last year 
when they voted to acquit Donald 
Trump for his corrupt actions in deal-
ing with Ukraine by conditioning mili-
tary assistance on receiving political 
dirt on Joe Biden. Their failure to lead, 
to hold Trump accountable, and frank-
ly to constrain his mania, emboldened 
him to push the boundaries of our po-
litical discourse further. 
Republicans have another chance to 
stand up for our democracy and against 
authoritarianism. They have a chance 
to accept the reality that has been 
clearly outlined for them in video, 
audio, and their own experiences. They 
can make a strong statement that po-
litical violence is unacceptable in the 
United States. They can—and should— 
vote to convict Donald Trump and bar 
him from ever holding office again. 
This is the real first, meaningful step 
that we can take to achieve the unity 
that we all claim to want. 
I will vote to convict. I hope that 
this time, more than one of them will 
be brave enough to lead by standing up 
and doing what is right. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I would 
like to enter a statement into the 
record. 
The President swears an oath to 
faithfully execute the Office of the 
Presidency and to ‘‘preserve, protect, 
and defend the Constitution of the 
United States.’’ At the very core of 
that oath is a commitment to democ-
racy, to government of the people, for 
the people, and by the people. 
President Trump tested that commit-
ment. Americans endured a pandemic 
while casting their votes in the Novem-
ber 2020 election. Following that elec-
tion, the outgoing President baselessly 
sowed doubt about its legitimacy and 
refused to commit to a peaceful transi-
tion of power. In the days leading up to 
January 6, 2021, President Trump agi-
tated his most dangerous supporters, 
who had already shown a propensity 
for violence, and called on them to 
interfere with Congress’ duty to for-
mally count the votes of the electoral 
college. Donald Trump wanted a riot to 
take place on January 6. We know be-
cause he said so. And when police offi-
cers defending the Capitol were over-
run by his mob, he did nothing. Democ-
racy is at its most fragile at the mo-
ment of transition, and that fragility is 
exactly what the former President 
sought to exploit. 
During President Trump’s second im-
peachment trial, his defense tried to 
paint for Americans a picture of a 
President who called for peaceful pro-
test and who bears no responsibility for 
the January 6 assault on the People’s 
House. But the President’s actions 
took place before our eyes. His conduct 
before, during, and immediately after 
the assault on the Capitol is well 
known to the American public. He is 
uniquely responsible for the events of 
January 6. 
Americans spoke clearly and force-
fully in November when they elected a 
new President. Donald Trump’s at-
tempt to cling to power through lies 
and violence is just what the Framers 
of our Constitution feared. But part of 
the brilliance of our Constitution’s sep-
aration of powers is that we, the Con-
gress, have the power and obligation to 
defend against such gross misconduct 
through impeachment. 
I voted to convict and disqualify 
former President Donald Trump be-
cause he violated his oath of office and 
because our future leaders must know 
that such abuses of power will not be 
tolerated in a free and democratic soci-
ety. I will continue to call out these 
abuses and to keep those in power ac-
countable. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, the es-
sence of any American President’s job 
is set forth in the oath he or she 
swears—an oath that the Founders con-
sidered so fundamental that they put it 
in the Constitution. And that job is to 
preserve, protect, and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
A President who violates that oath 
has committed an impeachable offense. 
That is a truth. There can be no rea-
sonable dispute that a President who 
fails at this basic responsibility is unfit 
to remain in office and cannot and 
should not be permitted to hold that 
office again. 
Not only did Donald Trump fail to 
uphold his oath, he took steps intended 
to violate it. It wasn’t mere negligence. 
It wasn’t even recklessness. Donald 
Trump engaged in an active, willful, 
intentional attack on our Constitution 
and our democracy. 
Donald Trump incited to violence 
and riot a mob that attacked the U.S. 
Capitol and our government. That is a 
high crime and misdemeanor. We all 
saw and heard the evidence during the 
trial. The video. The audio. The tweets. 
The statements. The affidavits. 
Months before the election, Donald 
Trump laid the groundwork for this in-
surrection, arguing he would only lose 
the election if there were fraud. After 
he lost, he repeated over and over 
again the ‘‘Big Lie’’ that the election 
was stolen. He agitated his supporters 
who falsely and wrongly believed that 
the election was rigged. 
Trump beckoned a mob to Wash-
ington for a rally when he knew the 
Congress would be counting the elec-
toral ballots. Trump’s people knew 
from law enforcement bulletins and in-
telligence that the mob was armed and 
dangerous. Yet, he riled them up and 
then sent them up Pennsylvania Ave-
nue to the Capitol. That rally became 
an orgy of violence and hate. Mayhem 
and destruction ensued, all in Donald 
Trump’s pursuit of staying in office be-
yond his term. Of ignoring our Con-
stitution. Of preventing a peaceful 
transfer of power. Of promulgating the 
Big Lie. Donald Trump did not express 
horror or outrage at the scenes playing 
out live on television. He did not 
quickly and decisively urge his sup-
porters to stop. He did not immediately 
call out the National Guard. He did not 
show any concern for the law enforce-
ment officers being beaten, maimed, 
and even killed at the Capitol. He re-
portedly delighted in what was hap-
pening, unable to comprehend why oth-
ers were not excited about it like he 
was. And he has never shown any re-
morse or an ounce of contrition or 
taken any responsibility. Instead, he

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S947 
March 1, 2021 
has maintained that he acted perfectly 
appropriately. 
The Senate of the United States sat 
as an Impeachment Court, with Demo-
crats and Republicans serving as ju-
rors. But the vast majority of those 
Republicans were more interested in 
fealty to Donald Trump than loyalty to 
our country. They were more con-
cerned about Trump’s base than basic 
justice. They were willing to ignore the 
truth to embrace the Big Lie. 
I had hoped the House managers 
would call witnesses. Clearly, there 
were individuals with direct knowledge 
of Trump’s state of mind during the in-
surrection, the danger at the Capitol as 
it unfolded, and his support of it. But 
even before we debated potential wit-
nesses, Republicans had made up their 
minds. They were unmoving in their fe-
alty to Trump. Republicans were will-
fully blind to the truth and the facts of 
the case. 
The rioters wanted to kill Vice Presi-
dent Pence and House Speaker PELOSI. 
They told us so. We know that the west 
side of the Capitol was breached around 
2 p.m. and that the rioters had overrun 
the Capitol. We know that the mob was 
approaching the Senate floor when our 
session was abruptly recessed at 2:13 
p.m. We know that Vice President 
PENCE was whisked off the Senate floor 
and that he was in mortal danger, as 
were all Members of Congress in their 
Chambers doing their constitutional 
duty. We know that all this was play-
ing out in real time on television and 
that Donald Trump had to know it was 
happening. And yet, about 10 minutes 
later, at 2:24 p.m., knowing all this, 
Donald Trump tweeted an attack at his 
own Vice President. ‘‘Mike Pence did 
not have the courage to do what should 
have been done to protect our Country 
and our Constitution.’’ And we know 
that around 2:26 p.m., Donald Trump 
called Senator TUBERVILLE not to as-
certain what was happening, not ask 
how the Vice President was or to offer 
aid and assistance against the insurrec-
tion. No, Trump called to ask Senator 
TUBERVILLE to delay the certification. 
It is clear whose side Donald Trump 
was on. 
There is no First Amendment defense 
to what Donald Trump did. The First 
Amendment has no application in an 
impeachment proceeding, which does 
not seek to punish unlawful speech, but 
to protect the Nation from a President 
who has violated his oath of office. 
But even if the First Amendment ap-
plied, even if we bought Trump’s law-
yers’ bogus claims that the First 
Amendment can be a defense, the argu-
ment utterly fails. Trump’s lawyers re-
lied on the Supreme Court’s decision in 
Brandenburg v. Ohio, but Brandenburg 
explained that the First Amendment 
protects advocacy, ‘‘except where such 
advocacy is directed to inciting immi-
nent lawless action and is likely to in-
cite or produce such action.’’ Once the 
Capitol was breached, the lawless ac-
tion was no longer imminent, it was 
actual. And Donald Trump was still 
tweeting words of encouragement to 
the rioters. There was a siege actually 
happening in the Capitol. There was no 
longer rhetorical fighting; there was 
actual fighting. On television. Live for 
everyone to see. 
The House managers proved their 
case with facts and evidence. Donald 
Trump incited and relished in an effort 
to violently overthrow our govern-
ment. He invited. He incited. He de-
lighted. 
Anyone who is opposed to abolishing 
the filibuster need only look at the 
vote to acquit and see how Republicans 
willfully blinded themselves to truth 
and facts in fealty to Trump and their 
party. Their votes to acquit once again 
show our hurdles to progress: Repub-
lican political calculations and their 
dereliction to truth and justice. 
The final tally on the vote to acquit 
does nothing to reassure me that Re-
publicans are willing to work together 
and transcend party politics. Repub-
licans had the opportunity to recognize 
that faith in the Constitution is a faith 
that we all share. Instead, they ignored 
the Constitution for a Big Lie. How can 
we expect them to work in good faith 
with Democrats to respond to the big 
challenges facing our Nation when they 
refuse to accept undeniable facts? 
The only reasonable conclusion based 
on the evidence presented at the trial 
was that Donald Trump committed an 
impeachable offense, should have been 
convicted, and should have been barred 
from holding future office. Republicans 
refused to accept or acknowledge that. 
I fear that with their votes to acquit, 
they have sown the seeds of another 
violent attack on our Constitution and 
our democracy. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, the 
impeachment trial of former President 
Donald Trump marked the third time 
in 1 year that the Senate has had to 
confront significant constitutional and 
institutional 
questions 
with 
con-
sequences that will undoubtedly rever-
berate into the future. As always, I am 
guided by the Constitution, historical 
precedent, and ‘‘a deep responsibility 
to future times,’’ as stated by Supreme 
Court Justice Joseph Story, our Na-
tion’s first great constitutional schol-
ar, two centuries ago. This is what has 
informed me during last year’s im-
peachment, the electorial college cer-
tification in January, and now another 
impeachment. 
This has been a disheartening episode 
for a divided America. Make no mis-
take: I condemn the horrific violence 
that engulfed the Capitol on January 6. 
All those who undertook violence on 
that day should be prosecuted to the 
fullest extent of the law. I also con-
demn former President Trump’s poor 
judgment in calling a rally on that 
day, and his actions and inactions 
when it turned into a riot. His blatant 
disregard for his own Vice President, 
Mike Pence, who was fulfilling his con-
stitutional duty at the Capitol, infuri-
ates me. I will never forget the brave 
men and women of law enforcement— 
some of whom lost their lives and were 
seriously 
injured—who 
carried 
out 
their patriotic duty to protect mem-
bers of Congress that day. 
However horrible the violence was— 
and how angry I have been about it—I 
believe that it is imperative, for the fu-
ture of our democracy, to examine 
closely the totality of the precedents, 
impeachment 
proceedings, 
and 
evi-
dence, and to be as dispassionate and 
impartial as possible in this case. 
That is why I cast my vote, on Feb-
ruary 13, 2021, to acquit former Presi-
dent Trump on the single Article of Im-
peachment, ‘‘incitement of insurrec-
tion.’’ 
The primary purpose of impeachment 
in our constitutional system is to re-
move an official from office—to, ac-
cording to Justice Story, divest an offi-
cial ‘‘of his political capacity.’’ The 
House’s single Article of Impeachment 
emphasized this need to remove Presi-
dent Trump from office. Regarding this 
case before the Senate, President Don-
ald Trump had already been removed 
from office by a vote of the American 
people this past November. Thus, pur-
suing impeachment in this case creates 
a troubling precedent in which former 
officials—private citizens—can face im-
peachment and conviction. 
Therefore, the fundamental issue in 
this impeachment trial is not removal 
from office but whether the Senate has 
or should accept jurisdiction to try, 
convict, and disqualify Donald Trump, 
a private citizen, from any future 
elected office based on the House’s sin-
gle article of impeachment—incite-
ment of insurrection. 
The House and Senate have never be-
fore claimed or exercised such im-
peachment jurisdiction over a former 
President. I do not believe that the 
Constitution empowers the Senate to 
have such impeachment jurisdiction. In 
his renowned ‘‘Commentaries on the 
Constitution,’’ Justice Story comes to 
the same conclusion, although to be 
fair, there are others who do not. I be-
lieve that the precedents set in claim-
ing that the Senate can try former 
Presidents who are private citizens 
have the very real potential to do sig-
nificant long-term damage to our con-
stitutional order, individual liberties, 
and the proper functioning of our Re-
public in a way that we will come to 
regret as a nation. 
Additionally in this case, the House 
undertook a ‘‘snap impeachment’’ in 48 
hours with no hearings, no witnesses, 
no record, and no defenses presented. 
When asked about this during the Sen-
ate trial, the House managers stated 
that constitutional due process protec-
tions for a defendant in an impeach-
ment are ‘‘discretionary’’ or, in other 
words, not required. This troubling 
declaration is now a precedent in the 
House. Combining this ‘‘no Due Proc-
ess/snap impeachment’’ precedent with 
the additional power of the Senate to 
try former officials, who are now pri-
vate citizens, amounts to a massive ex-
pansion 
of 
Congress’ 
impeachment

power 
never 
contemplated 
by 
our 
Founding Fathers. The temptation to 
use such power as a regular tool of par-
tisan warfare in the future will be 
great and has the potential to incapaci-
tate our government. 
Those in favor of expanding impeach-
ment jurisdiction to include the former 
President primarily point to the poten-
tial for Presidents or other officials to 
commit impeachable acts near the end 
of their term or shortly before resign-
ing. The House managers called this a 
‘‘January exception’’ to impeachment. 
They argued that this would allow such 
individuals to escape culpability and 
would frustrate the purpose of im-
peachment to hold public officials ac-
countable. This is a legitimate con-
cern. However, there are other rem-
edies available to punish such conduct 
of a former President through the judi-
cial system, if warranted. The Con-
stitution 
explicitly 
provides 
that 
former officials can be subject to 
criminal prosecution for their actions 
while in office, regardless of impeach-
ment. Moreover, even if such conduct 
eludes judicial review, the American 
people are well equipped to judge polit-
ical conduct and pass their judgement 
upon it. For that reason, and as I em-
phasized last year following the pre-
vious impeachment trial, I believe it 
can be left to the wise judgement of the 
American people on whether or not the 
former President should be disqualified 
from future office. 
Even if this Senate was empowered 
by the Constitution to hear this case, I 
do not believe that the House managers 
met their burden in proving the crit-
ical issue at trial—whether the former 
President intended there to be violence 
at the Capitol as a result of his speech 
at the Ellipse on January 6. Further-
more, the House managers claimed, in 
arguing their incitement charge, that 
First Amendment political speeth pro-
tections do not apply to elected offi-
cials in impeachment proceedings. A 
conviction based on this breathtaking 
precedent has the potential to signifi-
cantly further undermine core con-
stitutional protections for Americans 
and their ability to undertake political 
speech in the future. 
Finally, laced throughout the House 
managers’ presentations were subtle 
and not-sosubtle indictments, not just 
against the Capitol rioters who fully 
deserve condemnation but against all 
supporters of the former President, 
which of course includes many Alas-
kans. This sentiment is one that can-
not and should not be allowed to be 
perpetuated. In my view, this will not 
bring about the kind of unity that our 
Nation needs now. In contrast to what 
some of the House managers implied at 
this trial, the vast majority of Ameri-
cans and Alaskans who had supported 
President Trump were appalled by the 
violence on January 6. Such Alaskans 
supported this President because of his 
polices that helped our State. I will 
continue to work to make sure that 
these Alaskans’ voices are not silenced 
and that this dispiriting chapter in 
American history won’t deter them 
from speaking out in defense of their 
beliefs. 
This has been a difficult time for our 
Nation. My vote on February 13 was 
not in defense of the former President’s 
conduct on January 6 with which I 
fully disagreed, particularly his twitter 
attacks on Vice President Pence, as 
the Vice President undertook his con-
stitutional duties to preside over the 
electoral college vote at the Capitol. 
At the end of the day, my obligation 
is to rise above the passions of the mo-
ment and to carefully consider the de-
cisions we make today and the rami-
fications they will have for our coun-
try’s future. I believe that my vote to 
acquit fulfills that obligation. I want 
Alaskans and Americans to know that 
throughout all of this, my guiding 
light has been both fidelity to Alaska 
and to our Constitution. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
during this impeachment trial, I have 
adhered to the oath I swore at the 
trial’s outset to ‘‘do impartial justice,’’ 
and I have listened with care to the 
facts and law presented to me as a 
juror. 
These facts compel me to conclude 
that Donald Trump is guilty of inciting 
an insurrection against our Republic. 
As the evidence presented by the 
House 
impeachment 
managers 
has 
made clear, Donald Trump used the 
powers at his disposal to ensure he 
could keep his grip on the Presidency 
even though he lost the election. 
As the sitting President and a can-
didate for reelection, Donald Trump 
cast doubt on the results of that elec-
tion for months, arguing that the only 
way he would lose at the polls was by 
fraud. Then, after losing to Joe Biden 
by a margin of 7 million votes in a free 
and 
fair 
election, 
Donald 
Trump 
claimed it was a ‘‘fraudulent election.’’ 
As our system of government allows, 
Donald Trump turned to State and 
Federal courts to hear his allegations 
of widespread fraud. Some of those 
courts were presided over by judges 
who Donald Trump himself had se-
lected. Again and again, those courts 
rejected the allegations of fraud as 
baseless. 
Even Trump’s own Attorney General, 
William Barr, publicly declared that he 
had found no evidence of fraud that 
could have ‘‘effected a different out-
come in the election.’’ 
Faced with defeat in the courts, Mr. 
Trump nevertheless pressured officials 
at every level of both State and Fed-
eral government, including his own 
Vice President, Mike Pence, to change 
the election results. 
When those efforts failed, he encour-
aged his supporters to come to Wash-
ington, DC, on January 6, the day when 
Congress would certify the electoral 
college votes for Joe Biden. He claimed 
that the election was stolen and 
tweeted ‘‘We have just begun to fight,’’ 
promising that on January 6, it would 
be ‘‘wild.’’ On December 11, 2020, Don-
ald Trump released two campaign ads 
claiming the election was a ‘‘fraud’’ 
and instructing his supporters to ‘‘stop 
the steal.’’ His campaign paid $50 mil-
lion dollars for the ads and ran them 
up to and until January 5, 2021. 
Those who heeded that well-funded 
call understood what President Trump 
was asking. They didn’t just come with 
protest signs; they came with hand-
cuffs and rifles, bear spray and tactical 
gear, Molotov cocktails and crossbows, 
and walkie talkies for communication. 
On January 6, at a rally just before 
noon, Donald Trump asked the large 
crowd assembled before him to march 
on the Capitol. He asked them to fight 
‘‘like hell’’ because ‘‘if you don’t fight 
like hell, you’re not going to have a 
country anymore.’’ 
Despite knowing that there had been 
concerns for months about potential 
violence surrounding the election, Don-
ald Trump urged those at the rally 20 
times to ‘‘fight.’’ He also called on 
them to ‘‘stop the steal,’’ declaring 
‘‘you’ll never take back our country 
with weakness.’’ 
Inspired by President Trump’s words, 
his supporters began streaming toward 
the Capitol, where they eventually 
overwhelmed its defenses and threat-
ened those inside. Those in danger in-
cluded the Vice President, the Speaker 
of the House, Members of Congress, 
countless staffers, and thousands of 
members of law enforcement. 
And when Donald Trump saw that his 
supporters were battling U.S. Capitol 
Police officers and DC police, he said 
nothing to stop them for more than 2 
hours, even when he knew that Vice 
President Pence, one of his most loyal 
political allies, was in danger. More, he 
tweeted further criticism of Mr. Pence 
as the Vice President’s Secret Service 
detail was laboring to whisk Mr. Pence 
to safety. 
Donald Trump was willing to do al-
most anything to convince Vice Presi-
dent Pence to violate his duty to the 
Constitution, and so the Vice President 
had a target on his back. 
In other words, those who came to 
Washington 
at 
former 
President 
Trump’s request and attacked the seat 
of our democracy were trying to do ex-
actly 
what 
they 
believed 
Donald 
Trump asked them to: prevent the cer-
tification of Joe Biden as President- 
elect. 
That is why they frankly admitted, 
both during the Capitol riot and later 
to law enforcement, that they were at 
the Capitol because ‘‘[o]ur president 
wants us here.’’ 
In response to all these facts, Donald 
Trump argues that the Constitution 
does not permit ex-Presidents to be 
tried for impeachment and that the 
First Amendment protects his right to 
encourage an attack on our democracy. 
These 
arguments 
are 
lawyerly 
fig 
leaves. Mr. Trump relies on them so 
heavily because his own behavior is in-
defensible. 
The vast majority of legal scholars 
agree that the First Amendment does

not apply in this instance because the 
incitement of an insurrection is not 
protected speech under the Constitu-
tion. They also believe the Constitu-
tion allows for the impeachment and 
trial of public officials after they leave 
office, particularly when, as in this 
case, the public official was impeached 
by the House of Representatives while 
still in office. 
Otherwise, all an office-holder would 
have to do to protect him or herself 
from punishment would be to resign 
just before impeachment. The Senate 
has implicitly or explicitly agreed with 
this view three times in our Nation’s 
history; first, in the very first im-
peachment trial against former Sen-
ator William Blount of Tennessee, held 
during the lifetime of the Founders; 
second, in 1876 when Secretary of War 
William Belknap resigned just hours 
before the House voted to impeach him 
for bribery and corruption; and finally, 
in this impeachment trial of Donald 
Trump, when a bipartisan majority of 
the Senate agreed that this trial could 
proceed in spite of the defendant’s ob-
jections to its constitutionality. 
My colleagues understand that the 
Constitution gives Congress the power 
to impeach, convict, and disqualify a 
former officeholder. This is true be-
cause otherwise, the country would be 
vulnerable to a President of either 
party who could flout any law but re-
sign to be insulated from consequences. 
As the House managers have argued, 
if anything is impeachable, it is a 
President inciting his followers to vio-
lence to overturn a legitimate election. 
Our Founding Fathers held democ-
racy sacred. They feared a demagogue, 
a leader who would pervert the Con-
stitution in order to keep power, and 
they sought to protect the new Repub-
lic from such a president. 
Donald Trump is the person the 
Framers feared. He poses an existential 
threat to American democracy. He has 
shown himself willing to use almost 
every measure at his disposal to gain 
and retain power, even if it means 
overturning a free and fair election 
through violence. 
We can have no doubt what our 
Founding Fathers would have made of 
him: He was exactly the kind of person 
they wanted to prevent from holding 
and wielding power. 
We have seen over the course of this 
election the profound risks of trifling 
with our democracy and undermining 
the legitimacy of our elections. We 
cannot let future candidates of either 
party believe that in America, the way 
to win is to lie and cheat, to whip a 
crowd into a frenzy, to turn it on pub-
lic servants and law enforcement alike. 
We have to reestablish in our politics 
our absolute commitment to the idea 
that we resolve our disputes in our 
courts and in Congress, not by wielding 
weapons against lawmakers. 
Our Founding Fathers made clear in 
the very preamble to the Constitution 
that ‘‘We the people . . . in order to 
form a more perfect union, establish 
justice, ensure domestic tranquility 
. . . do ordain and establish this Con-
stitution.’’ America cannot be tranquil 
unless its leaders forswear violence and 
stand up for democracy. That is why I 
voted to convict Donald J. Trump of 
high crimes and misdemeanors against 
the American people. 
Unfortunately for our country, many 
of my colleagues did not agree. I know 
this is difficult news for many Amer-
ican patriots, who, just as I do, love 
and cherish our democratic traditions, 
the rule of law, and the centuries-old 
tradition of the peaceful transfer of 
power. To that majority of Americans, 
I want to say: We must not lose faith in 
our system of government. We must 
work all the more diligently to protect 
it. 
Right after Supreme Court decided 
the Dred Scott case—the most odious 
case in our long legal history—the 
great abolitionist and orator Frederick 
Douglass gave a speech. I turn to this 
speech whenever I am in need of hope. 
Precisely when slavery seemed to 
have won a decisive victory, Frederick 
Douglass, himself a former slave, said 
in that speech that his ‘‘hopes were 
never brighter than now.’’ He believed 
that the world would see what a ‘‘scan-
dalous tissue of lies’’ the Supreme 
Court’s decision in Dred Scott was. 
And he was right. History holds that 
Court case as one of the most shameful 
in our history, and I believe it will 
likewise condemn Donald Trump’s in-
citement of the Capitol attack. So 
today I remain hopeful because the 
people of Nevada and all Americans 
have been able to see the truth for 
themselves, and they understand that 
Donald J. Trump must never again be 
trusted to protect our sacred democ-
racy. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, the facts 
and the evidence were overwhelming: 
Former President Donald Trump lied 
for months to his supporters, sum-
moned them to Washington, and in-
cited a violent insurrection against our 
government and our democracy. I 
voted to convict because no reasonable 
person can listen to all the evidence 
presented and believe otherwise. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
would like to submit this statement for 
the record regarding the impeachment 
trial 
of 
former 
President 
Donald 
Trump. The statement reflects my 
thoughts on this complicated constitu-
tional matter and its implications for 
future impeachments. 
In 1787, the Articles of Confederation 
were failing, and our young Nation was 
struggling to address the many chal-
lenges it was being confronted with in 
its infancy. A collection of independent 
States, the newly formed country expe-
rienced much difficulty with the regu-
lation of trade and commerce, foreign 
affairs, and other basic domestic civil 
issues. With calls for disunion multi-
plying, delegates to the Constitutional 
Convention met to deliberate and forge 
a new government and with it an Exec-
utive to help centralize the powers nec-
essary to form a strong republic. Hav-
ing just shed the bonds of the British 
Monarchy and its infringements upon 
the liberties the delegates so des-
perately wanted to protect, there was 
much skepticism toward this idea. In 
order to abate these concerns, the Con-
stitution’s Framers provided for a 
means of removing an Executive, a 
Presidential impeachment. 
After much debate over particular 
wording, article II, section 4 of the 
Constitution adopted by the delegates 
reads: ‘‘The President, Vice President 
and all civil Officers of the United 
States, shall be removed from Office on 
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, 
Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors.’’ 
This is the fundamental impeach-
ment provision contained in the Con-
stitution and provides the primary evi-
dence as to why the lone Article passed 
out of the House as well as the subse-
quent trial in the Senate, was uncon-
stitutional. As this section shows, im-
peachment refers to ‘‘the President’’ 
and other officials, and it provides that 
that they shall be ‘‘removed from Of-
fice.’’ Donald J. Trump is no longer the 
President of the United States and 
therefore can no longer be removed 
from office. He is a private citizen. 
Further evidence that Donald Trump 
is no longer the President and there-
fore that this trial is unconstitutional 
can be found within the Senate’s im-
peachment authority: Article 1, section 
3 provides that ‘‘When the President of 
the United States is tried, the Chief 
Justice shall preside.’’ Chief Justice 
John Roberts did not preside over the 
impeachment trial, and instead that 
role was filled by the senior Senator 
from Vermont, PATRICK LEAHY. In a 
statement, 
Senator 
LEAHY
himself 
stated that the President pro tempore 
of the Senate ‘‘has historically pre-
sided over Senate impeachment trials 
of non-presidents.’’ These facts dem-
onstrate that Chief Justice Roberts de-
clined to preside over the trial because 
he did not believe that he had a con-
stitutional 
role 
and 
that 
Senator 
LEAHY
acknowledged 
that 
Donald 
Trump was no longer an officeholder. 
Finally, article 1, section 3 provides, 
‘‘Judgment in Cases of Impeachment 
shall not extend further than to re-
moval from Office, and disqualification 
to hold and enjoy any Office of honor.’’ 
This reiterates that removal from of-
fice must occur before that person is 
disqualified from holding an office 
again. If the Founders had intended 
that disqualification be a separate 
judgment, then the Constitution would 
have clearly stated ‘‘or’’ rather than 
‘‘and.’’ The Constitution does not give 
the Senate the authority to try a pri-
vate citizen or to remove him from an 
office that he no longer occupies. 
It also does not give the Senate the 
authority to disqualify him from an of-
fice that he was not removed from. 
I voted to acquit former President 
Donald Trump of the charge of inciting

an insurrection for the January 6 Cap-
itol riot because of these basic con-
cerns 
surrounding 
the 
constitu-
tionality of the proceeding. The im-
peachment of a private citizen, driven 
by political obsession, sets a very dan-
gerous precedent. What would prevent

impeaching former President Barack 
Obama or Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton? What about historical Presi-
dents such as George Washington, 
whose pivotal legacy no longer appears 
to meet the moral standards of con-
temporary times? While the political 
retaliation against the President is 
certain to continue now that he is out 
of office, I am proud to have been a 
part of the minority in the Senate to 
stand up to this type of unconstitu-
tional behavior and to acquit Donald 
Trump.

days, from delivery to the appropriate of-
fices, unless the Chair and Ranking Minority 
Member of the Committee waive the 48 hour 
waiting period or unless the Chair certifies 
in writing to the Chair and Ranking Minor-
ity Member of the Committee that, in the 
Chair’s opinion, it is necessary to issue a 
subpoena immediately. 
3. The Chair shall have the authority to 
call meetings of the Subcommittee. This au-
thority may be delegated by the Chair to any 
other Member of the Subcommittee when 
necessary. 
4. If at least three Members of the Sub-
committee desire the Chair to call a special 
meeting, they may file, in the office of the 
Subcommittee, a written request therefor, 
addressed to the Chair. Immediately there-
after, the clerk of the Subcommittee shall 
notify the Chair of such request. If, within 3 
calendar days after the filing of such re-
quest, the Chair fails to call the requested 
special meeting, which is to be held within 7 
calendar days after the filing of such re-
quest, a majority of the Subcommittee Mem-
bers may file in the office of the Sub-
committee their written notice that a spe-
cial Subcommittee meeting will be held, 
specifying the date and hour thereof, and the 
Subcommittee shall meet on that date and 
hour. Immediately upon the filing of such 
notice, the Subcommittee clerk shall notify 
all Subcommittee Members that such special 
meeting will be held and inform them of its 
date and hour. If the Chair is not present at 
any regular, additional or special meeting, 
the Ranking Majority Member present shall 
preside. 
5. For public or executive sessions, one 
Member of the Subcommittee shall con-
stitute a quorum for the administering of 
oaths and the taking of testimony in any 
given case or subject matter. 
One-third of the Members of the Sub-
committee shall constitute a quorum for the 
transaction of Subcommittee business other 
than the administering of oaths and the tak-
ing of testimony, provided that at least one 
member of the minority is present. 
6. All witnesses at public or executive 
hearings who testify to matters of fact shall 
be sworn. 
7. If, during public or executive sessions, a 
witness, witness counsel, or any spectator 
conducts themselves in such a manner as to 
prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or inter-
fere with the orderly administration of such 
hearing, the Chair or presiding Member of 
the Subcommittee present during such hear-
ing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the 
Senate, a representative of the Sergeant at 
Arms of the Senate, or any law enforcement 
official to eject said person from the hearing 
room. 
8. Counsel retained by any witness and ac-
companying such witness shall be permitted 
to be present during the testimony of such 
witness at any public or executive hearing 
and to advise such witness while the witness 
is testifying of the witness’s legal rights; 
provided, however, that in the case of any 
witness who is an officer or employee of the 
government, or of a corporation or associa-
tion, the Chair may rule that representation 
by counsel from the government, corpora-
tion, or association, or by counsel rep-
resenting another witness, creates a conflict 
of interest, and that the witness may only be 
represented during interrogation by Sub-
committee staff or during testimony before 
the Subcommittee by personal counsel not 
from the government, corporation, or asso-
ciation, or by personal counsel not rep-
resenting another witness. This rule shall 
not be construed to excuse a witness from 
testifying in the event witness counsel is 
ejected for conduct preventing, impeding, 
disrupting, obstructing, or interfering with 
the orderly administration of the hearings; 
nor shall this rule be construed as author-
izing counsel to coach the witness or answer 
for the witness. The failure of any witness to 
secure counsel shall not excuse such witness 
from complying with a subpoena or deposi-
tion notice. 
9. Depositions 
9.1 Notice. Notices for the taking of deposi-
tions in an investigation authorized by the 
Subcommittee shall be authorized and issued 
by the Chair. The Chair of the Committee 
and the Ranking Minority Member of the 
Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of 
the authorization for the taking of deposi-
tions. Such notices shall specify a time and 
place of examination, and the name of the 
Subcommittee Member or Members or staff 
officer or officers who will take the deposi-
tion. The deposition shall be in private. The 
Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures 
leading to criminal or civil enforcement pro-
ceedings for a witness’s failure to appear un-
less the deposition notice was accompanied 
by a Subcommittee subpoena. 
9.2 Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied 
at a deposition by counsel to advise them of 
their legal rights, subject to the provisions 
of Rule 8. 
9.3 Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined 
upon oath administered by an individual au-
thorized by local law to administer oaths. 
Questions shall be propounded orally by Sub-
committee Members or staff. Objections by 
the witness as to the form of questions shall 
be noted for the record. If a witness objects 
to a question and refuses to testify on the 
basis of relevance or privilege, the Sub-
committee Members or staff may proceed 
with the deposition, or may, at that time or 
at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by tele-
phone or otherwise on the objection from the 
Chair or such Subcommittee Member as des-
ignated by the Chair. If the Chair or des-
ignated Member overrules the objection, 
these Members may refer the matter to the 
Subcommittee or may order and direct the 
witness to answer the question, but the Sub-
committee shall not initiate procedures 
leading to civil or criminal enforcement un-
less the witness refuses to testify after being 
ordered and directed to answer by the Chair 
or designated Member. 
9.4 Filing. The Subcommittee staff shall 
see that the testimony is transcribed or elec-
tronically recorded. If it is transcribed, the 
witness shall be furnished with a copy for re-
view pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. 
The individual administering the oath shall 
certify on the transcript that the witness 
was duly sworn in the individual’s presence, 
the transcriber shall certify that the tran-
script is a true record of the testimony, and 
the transcript shall then be filed with the 
Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff 
may stipulate with the witness to changes in 
this procedure; deviations from this proce-
dure which do not substantially impair the 
reliability of the record shall not relieve the 
witness from the obligation to testify truth-
fully. 
10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared 
or written statement in executive or public 
hearings shall file a copy of such statement 
with the Chair, Staff Director, or Chief 
Counsel 48 hours in advance of the hearings 
at which the statement is to be presented 
unless the Chair and the Ranking Minority 
Member waive this requirement. The Sub-
committee shall determine whether such 
statement may be read or placed in the 
record of the hearing. 
11. A witness may request, on grounds of 
distraction, harassment, personal safety, or 
physical discomfort, that during testimony, 
television, motion picture, and other cam-
eras and lights, shall not be directed at the 
witness. Such requests shall be ruled on by 
the Subcommittee Members present at the 
hearing. 
12. An accurate stenographic record shall 
be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in 
executive and public hearings. The record of 
a witness’s own testimony, whether in public 
or executive session, shall be made available 
for inspection by the witness or witness 
counsel under Subcommittee supervision; a 
copy of any testimony given in public ses-
sion or that part of the testimony given by 
the witness in executive session and subse-
quently quoted or made part of the record in 
a public session shall be made available to 
any witness at the witness’s expense if re-
quested. 
13. Interrogation of witnesses at Sub-
committee hearings shall be conducted on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Subcommittee 
by 
Sub-
committee Members and authorized Sub-
committee staff personnel only. 
14. Any person who is the subject of an in-
vestigation in public hearings may submit to 
the Chair questions in writing for the cross- 
examination of other witnesses called by the 
Subcommittee. With the consent of a major-
ity of the Members of the Subcommittee 
present and voting, these questions, or para-
phrased versions of them, shall be put to the 
witness by the Chair, by a Member of the 
Subcommittee, or by counsel of the Sub-
committee.

native, (b) file a sworn statement of facts 
relevant to the testimony or other evidence 
or comment complained of. Such request and 
such statement shall be submitted to the 
Subcommittee for its consideration and ac-
tion. 
If a person requests to appear personally 
before the Subcommittee pursuant to alter-
native (a) referred to herein, said request 
shall be considered untimely if it is not re-
ceived by the Chair, Staff Director, or Chief 
Counsel in writing on or before thirty (30) 
days subsequent to the day on which said 
person’s name was mentioned or otherwise 
specifically identified during a public hear-
ing held before the Subcommittee, unless the 
Chair and the Ranking Minority Member 
waive this requirement. 
If a person requests to file a sworn state-
ment pursuant to alternative (b) referred to 
herein, the Subcommittee may condition the 
filing of said sworn statement upon said per-
son agreeing to appear personally before the 
Subcommittee and to testify concerning the 
matters contained in the person’s sworn 
statement, as well as any other matters re-
lated to the subject of the investigation be-
fore the Subcommittee. 
16. All testimony taken in executive ses-
sion shall be kept secret and will not be re-
leased for public information without the ap-
proval of a majority of the Members of the 
Subcommittee. 
17. No Subcommittee report shall be re-
leased to the public unless approved by a ma-
jority of the Subcommittee and after no less

59TH INAUGURAL CEREMONIES 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to thank the 
staff who worked tirelessly to ensure 
the 59th inaugural ceremonies were a 
success even under extreme and ex-
traordinary circumstances. 
The Joint Congressional Committee 
on Inaugural Ceremonies, also known 
as JCCIC, is tasked with the planning 
and execution of the inaugural cere-
monies of the President-Elect and Vice 
President-Elect of the United States at 
the Capitol. This ceremony is the cul-
mination of 244 years of a democracy. 
It is the moment when our leaders 
promise to be faithful to our Constitu-
tion. It is the moment when they be-
come, as we all should be, the guard-
ians of our country. 
I would like to thank the chair of 
JCCIC, Senator BLUNT, for his out-
standing work to ensure that the inau-
guration was an extraordinary success. 
It was a pleasure to work with Senator 
BLUNT and his extremely professional 
staff. 
I want to commend the entire JCCIC 
staff, especially Maria Lohmeyer, the 
Chief of Inaugural Ceremonies, for 
their remarkable accomplishment. I 
also want to thank Vincent Brown, 
who works for me on the Senate Rules 
Committee, for his work while detailed 
to JCCIC, as well as my chief of staff, 
Lindsey Kerr, who worked diligently 
with JCCIC and many other agencies 
and offices to ensure a smooth Inau-
guration. 
Maria, Vincent, Lindsey, and the en-
tire committee staff have shown that, 
through hard work and determination, 
the entire world can see our democracy 
prevail. 
This year’s inauguration was the 59th 
in our country’s history, and it may 
have been one of the most challenging 
ever to design. Planning an inaugura-
tion under normal circumstances is dif-
ficult, but this year’s event occurred in 
the midst of a global pandemic, just 2 
weeks after rioters climbed the inau-
gural stage to siege the Capitol. 
The inauguration is an important 
symbol in our democracy. It has 
marked the peaceful transfer of power 
for more than 200 years. It sends an im-
portant message to the American peo-
ple and the world, of unity and a com-
mitment to our democratic principles. 
Inauguration day represents a new 
beginning for the country. It marks the 
beginning of healing, of unifying, of 
coming together to get through this 
crisis. 
This inauguration was the result of 
Democrats and Republicans working 
together to bring about this important 
symbol of our determined democracy. 
And that spirit of bipartisanship, of 
working 
together, 
was 
certainly 
present on the Joint Congressional 
Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. 
Thank you to everyone who made 
that incredible day one we will remem-
ber forever.

RECOGNIZING THE 90TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
NATIONAL 
LI-
BRARY SERVICE FOR THE BLIND 
AND PRINT DISABLED 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize the National Li-
brary Service for the Blind and Print 
Disabled on its 90th anniversary. The 
National Library Service, or NLS, is 
part of the Library of Congress, an in-
stitution that has long been committed 
to serving readers with disabilities. 
The concept of a national library for 
the blind was introduced in 1897 by the 
seventh Librarian of Congress, John 
Russell Young, who established a read-
ing room for the blind that included 
more than 500 books and music items 
in raised characters. 
In 1913, Congress began to require 
that one copy of each book be made in 
raised characters and deposited in the 
Library of Congress for educational 
use; but, as impressive as this collec-
tion was, it was only available to peo-
ple who were able to visit in person. In 
1931, legislation led by Representative 
Ruth Pratt of New York and Senator 
Reed Smoot of Utah created what we 
now know as the National Library 
Service for the Blind and Print Dis-
abled to help provide services to blind 
readers across the country through a 
national network of cooperating librar-
ies, in braille or audio formats, mailed 
directly 
to 
patrons, 
or 
available 
through instant download. Since its es-
tablishment, the service has grown to 
expand service to children, serve people 
with physical and reading disabilities, 
and encompass an accessible music ma-
terials collection that is now the larg-
est in the world. 
I also want to recognize the central 
role local libraries play in connecting 
the national NLS program to constitu-
ents in my State. NLS and the Min-
nesota Talking Book and Braille Li-
brary provide service to nearly 6,600 
people and over 1,600 institutions in 
Minnesota, each day working to make 
the NLS mission ‘‘that all may read’’ a 
reality. 
The National Library Service for the 
Blind and Print Disabled has long had 
an innovative approach to meeting the 
needs of Americans with disabilities, 
with an institutional history that 
spans 
phonograph 
records, 
cassette 
tapes, flash memory cartridges, and 
the internet while it continually sup-
plies hard-copy and digital braille ma-
terials. Today, I congratulate the Na-
tional Library Service for the Blind 
and Print Disabled and its dedicated 
staff on its 90th anniversary and ex-
press my appreciation of their contin-
ued commitment to ensuring that all 
may read.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE 75TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF ENIAC DAY 
∑ Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today in commemoration of the 75th 
anniversary of the electronic numer-
ical integrator and computer. This an-
niversary, formally known as ENIAC 
Day, marks the 1946 dedication at the 
University of Pennsylvania of the first 
all-electronic, 
programmable 
com-
puter. 
Invented by John Mauchly and J. 
Presper Eckert of the University’s 
Moore School of Electrical Engineer-
ing, construction of the computer 
began in July 1943. After several years 
of tireless work, Mauchly and Eckert 
produced a 27–ton computer that occu-
pied 1,800 square feet of floor space and 
could complete complex calculations 
near instantaneously. Also due credit 
are 
the 
original 
programmers 
of 
ENIAC, Kathleen McNulty Mauchly 
Antonelli, 
Jean 
Jennings 
Bartik, 
Frances 
Betty 
Snyder 
Holberton, 
Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Frances Bilas 
Spence, 
and 
Ruth 
Lichterman 
Teitelbaum, without whom the oper-
ation of the machine would not be pos-
sible. After ENIAC, Mauchly and Eck-
ert continued to be industry pioneers 
and went on to invent UNIVAC, the 
first commercial computer. Today’s 
Unisys Corporation, which I am proud 
to note is headquartered in Blue Bell, 
PA, traces a momentous part of its ori-
gins back to J. Presper Eckert and 
John Mauchly and their early inven-
tions. 
As we mark this 75th anniversary, we 
marvel at the impact of ENIAC and 
how far computers have come. While 
ENIAC was originally intended as a 
tool to further our national defense, we 
have come to rely on later iterations of 
the computer in all aspects of life. 
Computers enable us to be more effi-
cient, more connected and have trans-
formed the world we live in. I look for-
ward to what the world looks like when 
we celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
ENIAC Day in 2046.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING CONTINUOUS 
COMPOSITES 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a sen-
ior member and former chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, each month I 
recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting 
the success of a small business in my 
home State of Idaho. Today, I am 
pleased to honor Continuous Compos-
ites, Inc., in Coeur d’Alene as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for March 
2021. 
Continuous Composites is a tech-
nology company developing composite 
additive manufacturing solutions co-
founded by Ken Tyler, John Swallow, 
and Tyler Alvarado in 2015. The com-
pany owns the world’s earliest granted 
patents on Continuous Fiber 3D Print-
ing—CF3D—a 
revolutionary, 
auto-
mated manufacturing process that uti-
lizes high-performance continuous fi-
bers, e.g., carbon fiber, glass fiber, opti-
cal 
fibers, 
with 
‘‘snap 
curing’’ 
thermoset resins to produce light-
weight, 
high-performance 
composite 
parts on-demand. Historically, compos-
ites have been limited to high-end 
products, including military applica-
tions, where the advantages of high- 
performance, 
low-weight 
materials 
outweigh costly conventional manufac-
turing processes. CF3D is reshaping 
composites manufacturing at exponen-
tially reduced costs and lead times 
while providing users with a much 
greater degree of design freedom. The 
company has an extraordinary oppor-
tunity to change how industrial busi-
nesses and the Department of Defense 
innovate and manufacture throughout 
the entire product life cycle, from de-
sign and prototyping to serial produc-
tion 
and 
sustainment. 
Continuous 
Composites’ novel approach to 3–D 
printing has garnered interest from 
many industry leaders, national lab-
oratories, and government agencies re-
sulting in strategic partnerships and 
multimillion 
dollar 
equity 
invest-
ments. Continuous Composites’ CF3D 
technology is directly aligned with the 
United States of America’s national de-
fense strategy, which has led to signifi-
cant engagement from the Air Force 
Research Laboratory. 
Since its founding, Continuous Com-
posites has been rapidly hiring numer-
ous engineers and business profes-
sionals, attracting talent from across 
the country to Coeur d’Alene. Last 
September, Alvarado and Swallow an-
nounced the remodel and opening of a 
7,500-square-foot manufacturing dem-
onstration facility on their campus in 
downtown Coeur d’Alene. This historic 
building is now being used for advanced 
research, development, and commer-
cialization of CF3D. The expansion will 
provide high-paying, in-demand jobs of 
the future to the Coeur d’Alene com-
munity. 
Continuous Composites is an out-
standing example of a small, trail-
blazing Idaho business that is leading 
the way in technological innovation. 
Congratulations to Tyler, John, Ken, 
and the whole Continuous Composites 
team for your outstanding achieve-
ments. You make our great State 
proud, and I look forward to your con-
tinued growth and success.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S954 
March 1, 2021 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 8 
Whereas, The Congress of the United 
States first adopted daylight saving time 
during World War I to support war indus-
tries. In addition, continuous daylight sav-
ing time was observed during World War II, 
referred to as War Time, and during the 1973 
oil crisis; and 
Whereas, The benefits of daylight saving 
time include additional daylight in the 
evening hours, increased outdoor playtime 
for the children and youth, expanded eco-
nomic opportunities, energy savings, im-
proved traffic safety, and crime reduction; 
and 
Whereas, States are currently precluded 
from establishing permanent daylight saving 
time by federal law, which requires the 
United States Secretary of Transportation 
to enforce uniform application of that law 
across all time zones (certain states, such as 
Arizona, previously opted out of daylight 
saving time); and 
Whereas, The Sunshine Protection Act of 
2019 (H.R. 1556), introduced in the 116th Con-

NONVIOLENT 
MOVEMENT

SUPPORT 
OF 
FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
IN CUBA, AND CALLING FOR THE 
RELEASE 
OF 
ALL 
POLITICAL 
PRISONERS IN CUBA 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Mr. 
MENENDEZ) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 81 
Whereas Las Damas de Blanco (also known 
as the ‘‘Ladies in White’’) is a group com-
posed of wives and relatives of political pris-
oners, prisoners of conscience, and peaceful 
dissidents in Cuba; 
Whereas, in April 2003, during the wave of 
repression known as the ‘‘Black Spring’’, a 
group of strong and courageous women 
formed Las Damas de Blanco in response to 
the wrongful imprisonment of their family 
members by the Cuban regime; 
Whereas members of Las Damas de Blanco 
continue attempting to attend Sunday mass 
in the Church of Santa Rita de Casia in Ha-
vana, and other churches throughout dif-
ferent provinces in Cuba, and then march 
peacefully through the streets of Havana 
holding gladiolus despite the Cuban regime’s 
constant efforts to block their nonviolent ex-
ercise of freedom of assembly and speech; 
Whereas members of Las Damas de Blanco 
regularly march to advocate for the release 
of all political prisoners and the freedom of 
the Cuban people; 
Whereas, despite exercising their funda-
mental rights to freedom of expression and 
assembly, members of Las Damas de Blanco 
are regularly attacked by security forces and 
mobs organized by the Cuban regime;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

March 1, 2021 
Whereas, according to Amnesty Inter-
national— 
(1) Las Damas de Blanco ‘‘remain[s] one of 
the primary targets of repression by Cuban 
[G]overnment authorities’’; and 
(2) members of Las Damas de Blanco are 
frequently detained and ‘‘often beaten by law 
enforcement officials and state security 
agents dressed as civilians’’ while in deten-
tion; 
Whereas, according to the Human Rights 
Watch 2019 World Report, in Cuba ‘‘detention 
is often used preemptively to prevent people 
from participating in peaceful marches or 
meetings to discuss politics, and detainees 
are often beaten, threatened, and held in-
communicado for hours or days’’; 
Whereas the Human Rights Watch 2019 
World Report noted that ‘‘Cuban Police or 
state security agents continue to routinely 
harass, rough up, and detain members of Las 
Damas de Blanco before or after they attend 
Sunday mass’’; 
Whereas, in 2005, Las Damas de Blanco 
were selected to receive the Sakharov Prize 
for Freedom of Thought, but the Cuban re-
gime did not allow members of the group to 
leave the island to accept the award; 
Whereas Laura Ines Polla´n Toledo, the 
founder of Las Damas de Blanco, left a leg-
acy of peaceful protest against human and 
civil rights abuses in Cuba; 
Whereas Laura Ines Polla´n Toledo died on 
October 14, 2011, and while her death gar-
nered widespread international attention, 
the Cuban regime remained silent; 
Whereas, in February 2015, 30 members of 
Las Damas de Blanco were arrested in an at-
tempt by Cuban officials to bar the women 
from participating in marches, which sought 
to advocate for the freedom of political pris-
oners in Cuba; 
Whereas, while Rau´ l Castro is no longer 
the head of Cuba, grave human rights abuses 
continue under the current President of 
Cuba, Miguel Dı´az-Canel; 
Whereas Las Damas de Blanco has ap-
pealed to the United States Government and 
other foreign governments in order to bring 
international attention to the repression of 
dissidents by the Cuban regime and the 
plight of political prisoners, who are rou-
tinely jailed unjustly and without due proc-
ess; 
Whereas, on May 17, 2018, Las Damas de 
Blanco received the prestigious 2018 Milton 
Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty in 
recognition of the bravery of the group and 
its continuing efforts to fight for individual 
freedom in Cuba; 
Whereas 
Berta 
de 
los 
Angeles 
Soler 
Ferna´ndez and Leticia Ramos Herreria, 
members of Las Damas de Blanco, were pro-
hibited by the Dı´az-Canel regime from leav-
ing Cuba to accept the 2018 Milton Friedman 
Prize for Advancing Liberty in the United 
States; 
Whereas, on May 6, 2018, Aymara Nieto 
Mun˜ oz, a member of Las Damas de Blanco, 
was violently arrested and during her trans-
fer in a patrol car, was beaten by a uni-
formed cop, causing Nieto to require medical 
attention; 
Whereas, following 10 days of confinement 
in a cell of the Santiago de las Vegas-La 
Habana, Aymara Nieto Mun˜ oz was trans-
ferred to Havana’s women’s prison, known as 
the Guatao, and remains detained pending a 
trial for an alleged ‘‘crime of attack’’ with 
other prisoners arrested for petty crimes; 
Whereas this is the second time that 
Aymara Nieto Mun˜ oz has been imprisoned 
for political reasons, as she was sentenced to 
1 year of prison for an alleged crime of public 
disorder following a politically charged trial 
on June 3, 2017; 
Whereas, in March 2018, Marta Sa´nchez 
Gonza´lez was arrested for peacefully pro-
testing and transferred to a women’s prison 
a month later; 
Whereas, on August 2018, Marta Sa´nchez 
Gonza´lez faced a rigged trial and was sen-
tenced to 4 years and 6 months of imprison-
ment alongside prisoners incarcerated for 
common crimes; 
Whereas, throughout 2019, Las Damas de 
Blanco experienced countless arrests, acts of 
repression, and violent attacks intended to 
imperil their physical and mental state as a 
result of their peaceful advocacy of the re-
lease of all political prisoners; 
Whereas the total number of arrests in 2019 
conducted by the Cuban Police against Las 
Damas de Blanco is 1,120, including those of 
Berta Soler Ferna´ndez, who has been con-
stantly harassed, violently attacked, and de-
tained for lengthy periods of time, and 
Xiomara de las Mercedes Cruz Miranda, who 
was imprisoned in 2018; 
Whereas, upon entering prison the first 
time on April 15, 2016, Ms. Cruz Miranda was 
in good health, but after being sent to prison 
for the second time in 2018, she acquired a 
rare skin disease in the women’s prison in 
Ciego de A´ vila and her health began to be af-
fected by several conditions, including tuber-
culosis, which severely damaged her res-
piratory system and her mental and physical 
health; and 
Whereas Ms. Cruz Miranda remained hos-
pitalized for more than 6 months in Cuba, 
and after her health condition failed to sta-
bilize, she was admitted to Jackson South 
Hospital in the City of Miami on January 
2020, thanks to a humanitarian visa granted 
by the United States Government: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the courageous members of Las 
Damas de Blanco for their peaceful efforts to 
speak up for the voiceless and stand up to 
the Cuban regime in defense of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom 
of expression and assembly; 
(2) recognizes the brave leaders of Las 
Damas de Blanco who have been arbitrarily 
detained due to their peaceful activism, in-
cluding Marta Sa´nchez Gonza´lez, who is cur-
rently serving a sentence under house arrest, 
and Aymara Nieto Mun˜ oz, who is imprisoned 
an extended distance from her family, which 
poses significant obstacles to family visits; 
(3) expresses solidarity with the Cuban peo-
ple and a commitment to the democratic as-
pirations of those Cubans calling for a free 
Cuba; 
(4) calls on the Cuban regime to allow 
members of Las Damas de Blanco to attend 
weekly masses and travel freely both domes-
tically and internationally; and 
(5) calls for the release of all political pris-
oners detained and imprisoned by the Cuban 
regime.

82—HON-
ORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF JOHN ROBERT LEWIS AND 
COMMENDING 
JOHN 
ROBERT 
LEWIS 
FOR 
HIS 
TOWERING 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
IN 
THE 
NON-
VIOLENT STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL 
RIGHTS 
Mr. OSSOFF (for himself, Mr. ROM-
NEY, Mr. WARNOCK, Mr. REED, Mr. 
CARDIN, and Mr. LEAHY) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 82 
Whereas John Robert Lewis (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘Mr. Lewis’’) was born on 
February 21, 1940, near Troy, Alabama, the 
third of 10 children born to his mother Willie 
Mae (ne´e Carter) and his father Eddie Lewis, 
a sharecropper; 
Whereas, at 5 years old, Mr. Lewis was 
given responsibility for the family chicken 
flock, including his favorite, Li’l Pullet, 
which he tended with great care and to 
which he would preach nearly every evening, 
which— 
(1) led his family to give Mr. Lewis the 
childhood nickname of ‘‘Preacher’’; and 
(2) instilled in Mr. Lewis an early desire to 
enter the clergy; 
Whereas, from a young age, Mr. Lewis in-
sisted on attending school daily, defying his 
parents’ instructions to work the family 
farm, which established within Mr. Lewis a 
lifelong commitment to education and en-
lightenment; 
Whereas when Mr. Lewis was 15 years old 
he was ‘‘shaken to the core’’, as described in 
his memoir ‘‘Walking With the Wind’’, by 
the Mississippi murder of Emmett Till, deep-
ening his passionate opposition to segrega-
tion and Jim Crow laws; 
Whereas, as a high school student, Mr. 
Lewis intensely followed the progress of the 
Montgomery Bus Boycott (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘Boycott’’) in 1955 and 1956, 
awakening him to the power of nonviolent 
resistance to segregation; 
Whereas Mr. Lewis wrote in his memoir 
that the Boycott ‘‘changed my life more 
than any other event before or since’’; 
Whereas, while following the progress of 
the Boycott, Mr. Lewis was inspired by radio 
broadcasts featuring one of the leaders of the 
Boycott, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘Dr. King’’)— 
(1) whom Mr. Lewis’ parents referred to as 
‘‘that young preacher’’; and 
(2) whose example deepened Mr. Lewis’ am-
bition to become a minister; 
Whereas, inspired by Dr. King, Mr. Lewis, 
on February 16, 1956, 5 days before his 16th 
birthday, preached his first public sermon, 
entitled ‘‘A Praying Mother’’, at Macedonia 
Baptist Church in Troy, Alabama, which 
came from the First Book of Samuel and dis-
cussed the example of Hannah, mother of 
Samuel, which sermon made such an impact 
that it was published in the Montgomery Ad-
vertiser newspaper; 
Whereas, on February 18, 1956, 2 days after 
Mr. Lewis gave his first public sermon, a rel-
ative of Mr. Lewis, Thomas Brewer of Colum-
bus, Georgia, a voting rights activist work-
ing with the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People (referred to 
in this preamble as the ‘‘NAACP’’), was shot 
to death by a white man who was never in-
dicted for the murder; 
Whereas Mr. Lewis joined the NAACP in 
the summer of 1956; 
Whereas, in 1958, Mr. Lewis wrote a letter 
to Dr. King, who responded with a round trip 
bus ticket for Mr. Lewis to visit Mont-
gomery, Alabama, where Mr. Lewis and Dr. 
King 
met 
at 
Reverend 
Ralph 
David 
Abernathy’s First Baptist Church; 
Whereas, while a student at the American 
Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, 
Tennessee, Mr. Lewis— 
(1) was a founding member of the Student 
Nonviolent 
Coordinating 
Committee 
(re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘SNCC’’); 
and 
(2) organized sit-ins at segregated lunch 
counters, pushing Nashville to become the 
first major city in the South to begin the de-
segregation of public facilities; 
Whereas Mr. Lewis graduated from the 
American Baptist Theological Seminary in 
1961, and was subsequently ordained as a 
Baptist minister; 
Whereas, in 1961, Mr. Lewis became one of 
the 13 original Freedom Riders, who chal-
lenged segregated interstate travel through-
out the South;

S960 
March 1, 2021 
Whereas, at just 23 years old, Mr. Lewis 
helped organize the 1964 March on Wash-
ington, at which— 
(1) Dr. King gave his famous ‘‘I Have a 
Dream’’ speech; and 
(2) Mr. Lewis vowed, in his address at the 
Lincoln Memorial, to ‘‘splinter the seg-
regated South into a thousand pieces and put 
them back together in the image of God and 
democracy’’; 
Whereas Mr. Lewis led demonstrations 
against racially segregated hotels, rest-
rooms, swimming pools, and public parks for 
which he was brutally beaten, left uncon-
scious in his own blood, and arrested 40 
times, spending countless nights in county 
jails and 37 days in Parchman Penitentiary; 
Whereas, in 1963, as Chair of the SNCC, Mr. 
Lewis moved to Atlanta, Georgia;

manding their right to vote across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, 
where Mr. Lewis, who suffered a fractured 
skull, and other demonstrators were met 
with violence and police brutality; 
Whereas, after televised images of the 
Bloody Sunday violence in Selma shocked 
the conscience of the United States, Presi-
dent Lyndon B. Johnson called for equal vot-
ing rights legislation before a joint session of 
Congress, which evolved into his signing of 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 
et seq.) on August 6, 1965; 
Whereas, on December 21, 1968, Mr. Lewis 
married the love of his life, Lillian Miles, 
who was his best friend, closest ally, and 
most steadfast supporter until her death on 
December 31, 2012, the 45th anniversary of 
their meeting; 
Whereas, in 1970, Mr. Lewis became direc-
tor of the Voter Education Project, which 
added nearly 4,000,000 minority voters to the 
voter rolls and changed the political land-
scape of the United States forever; 
Whereas, in 1977, President Jimmy Carter 
appointed Mr. Lewis to direct more than 
250,000 volunteers of ACTION, which was 
then a Federal volunteer agency; 
Whereas, in 1981, Mr. Lewis won elected of-
fice for the first time as an at-large Council-
man on the Atlanta City Council, where he 
was a powerful advocate for ethics and 
neighborhood preservation, including saving 
from destruction the historic neighborhoods 
of the Old Fourth Ward, Inman Park, Can-
dler Park, and Druid Hills; 
Whereas, in 1982, Mr. Lewis worked with 
the American Jewish Committee to found 
the Atlanta Black-Jewish Coalition, part of 
his decades-long friendship and alliance with 
the Jewish community of Georgia, which 
later led to the establishment of the Con-
gressional Black-Jewish caucus; 
Whereas, in 1986, Mr. Lewis became the 
second African American to represent Geor-
gia in Congress since Reconstruction; 
Whereas Mr. Lewis fought for the passage 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (Public Law 
102–166; 105 Stat. 1071), which was signed into 
law by President George H.W. Bush; 
Whereas, in 2001, Mr. Lewis was awarded 
the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation 
Profile in Courage Award for ‘‘his extraor-
dinary courage, leadership and commitment 
to civil rights’’; 
Whereas Mr. Lewis led the effort to build 
what is now known as the Sam Nunn Atlanta 
Federal Center, one of the largest Federal 
buildings in the United States; 
Whereas, in 2003, Mr. Lewis secured author-
ization for construction of the National Mu-
seum of African American History and Cul-
ture on the National Mall in Washington, 
DC; 
Whereas, in 2007, Mr. Lewis introduced the 
Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime 
Act of 2007 (28 U.S.C. 509 note; Public Law 
110–344) to investigate unsolved civil rights 
crimes, which was signed into law by Presi-
dent George W. Bush in 2008; 
Whereas, in 2011, President Barack Obama 
awarded Mr. Lewis the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the 
United States; 
Whereas Mr. Lewis’ colleagues referred to 
him as the ‘‘conscience of the Congress’’ for 
his— 
(1) relentless pursuit of justice; 
(2) unflinching commitment to building 
what Dr. King and Mr. Lewis referred to as 
the ‘‘Beloved Community’’, a society with-
out poverty, racism, or violence; and 
(3) willingness to make what he called 
‘‘good trouble, necessary trouble’’ to con-
front acts of injustice; and 
Whereas, on July 17, 2020, Mr. Lewis died, 
devastating his family, his staff, the City of 
Atlanta, the State of Georgia, and the people 
of the United States, who united to honor his 
monumental legacy of hard work and self- 
sacrifice in the pursuit of liberty and justice 
for all, which culminated in Mr. Lewis lying 
in state at the United States Capitol before 
his memorial service at Ebenezer Baptist 
Church in Atlanta: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the life and legacy of John Rob-
ert Lewis, an American hero and civil rights 
leader who— 
(A) faced brutality and suffered grievous 
injuries while remaining steadfastly com-
mitted to the nonviolent struggle for civil 
rights; 
(B) dedicated his life to defending the dig-
nity of all people and building the ‘‘Beloved

(C) spent more than 3 decades as a Member 
of Congress defending and strengthening 
civil rights; and 
(2) commends John Robert Lewis for his 
towering achievements in the nonviolent 
struggle for civil rights.

RESOLUTION 
85—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE THAT IT IS THE DUTY 
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
TO DRAMATICALLY EXPAND AND 
STRENGTHEN THE CARE ECON-
OMY 
Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Mr. BROWN, and Mr. MERKLEY) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 85 
Whereas the preamble of the Constitution 
of the United States cites the duty to ‘‘pro-
mote the general Welfare’’, establishing care 
for the people of the United States as one of 
the pillars of our system of government; 
Whereas, even before the novel coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, and the 
recession it triggered— 
(1) the United States was experiencing pro-
found crises of care and well-being; and 
(2) critical public services and programs in 
the United States were underresourced or 
nonexistent; 
Whereas we are interdependent and, at var-
ious stages of life, everyone will give or re-
ceive care; 
Whereas care work makes all other work 
possible, and the economy of the United 
States cannot thrive without a healthy and 
robust foundation of care for all people; 
Whereas over 3,700,000 children are born 
every year in the United States, and about 
10,000 people in the United States reach re-
tirement age each day; 
Whereas nearly 20,000,000 adults in the 
United States have long-term care needs 
arising from old age or a disability; 
Whereas, in 2019, more than 1 out of 5 
adults in the United States had been an un-
paid caregiver for an adult family member or 
friend, or for a child with disabilities, in the 
preceding 12 months; 
Whereas 60 percent of unpaid caregivers 
worked for pay outside the home, and most 
were women; 
Whereas over 3,000,000 children and young 
people in the United States had also been 
caregivers for adults; 
Whereas, in 2019, women in the United 
States spent an average of nearly 4 hours per 
day on unpaid care work and housework, 57 
percent more hours than men; 
Whereas just as our country’s physical in-
frastructure is crumbling, the Federal and 
State programs constituting our care infra-
structure are an outdated patchwork, and 
quality care is inaccessible for millions of 
people in the United States; 
Whereas the United States does not guar-
antee paid time off to give and receive care, 
and is the only industrialized country in the 
world without a national paid family and 
medical leave program; 
Whereas, in 2018, only 17 percent of the 
United States workforce had access to paid 
family leave through their employer; 
Whereas the median cost of a private room 
in a nursing home facility is $105,850 per 
year; 
Whereas childcare is the highest household 
expense for families in much of the United 
States, and public childcare assistance is 
limited; 
Whereas Medicaid— 
(1) covers long-term care needs, but with 
strict income and asset eligibility require-
ments; and 
(2) has an institutional bias, requiring 
State programs to cover care in congregate 
facilities, while home and community-based 
services are optional and limited; 
Whereas Medicare generally does not cover 
long-term services and supports; 
Whereas only 7 percent of individuals in 
the United States aged 50 or older are cov-
ered by private long-term care insurance, 
which is often prohibitively expensive; 
Whereas, in 2019, nearly 30,000,000 people, 
including 4,400,000 children, did not have 
health insurance in the United States, over 
half of them people of color, and tens of mil-
lions more people were underinsured; 
Whereas 
the 
median 
annual 
pay 
of 
childcare and home care workers is $25,510 
and $17,200, respectively, leading to high 
turnover and reliance on public assistance; 
Whereas childcare workers are 95 percent 
women, and home care workers are 87 per-
cent women, both disproportionately people 
of color and immigrants; 
Whereas, in 2020, according to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, 8 percent of health care 
support workers and 3.6 percent of personal 
care and service workers were members of 
unions; 
Whereas these conditions have historical 
roots, as— 
(1) in the decades following the abolition of 
slavery in the United States, Black people 
primarily worked as domestic and agricul-
tural laborers; and 
(2) during the New Deal-era, domestic and 
agricultural workers were excluded from so-
cial programs and labor protections, particu-
larly those created by— 
(A) the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 
et seq.); 
(B) the National Labor Relations Act (29 
U.S.C. 151 et seq.); and 
(C) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 
(29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.); 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has un-
derscored that frontline work, including di-
rect care, childcare, nursing, health care, 
public 
and 
community 
health, 
mental 
health, domestic, social assistance, edu-
cation, service, retail, delivery, food, res-
taurant, agricultural, and other work, is es-
sential to the functioning and flourishing of 
the United States, and to the care of all peo-
ple; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, it 
has been necessary for frontline workers to 
engage in numerous strikes and work stop-
pages to obtain safe workplaces, personal 
protective equipment, the right to shelter in 
place, and other basic protections; 
Whereas domestic workers, mostly from 
the global South, were the most common 
victims of labor trafficking reported in the 
United States between 2007 and 2017; 
Whereas care and domestic workers who 
are migrants or immigrants are especially 
likely to face wage theft, abuse, and other 
forms of exploitation; 
Whereas hospitals in the United States are 
understaffed, and most of the country does 
not require minimum nurse-to-patient ratios 
that save lives; 
Whereas health care and social assistance 
workers suffer from the highest rates of inju-
ries due to workplace violence; 
Whereas the closure of rural hospitals is 
accelerating, and 135 rural hospitals have 
closed since 2010; 
Whereas Black, Latino, and Indigenous 
people have all been more than twice as like-
ly to die of COVID–19 than White people; 
Whereas adults receiving long-term care in 
institutional settings represent less than 1 
percent of the United States population, but 
account for more than one-third of COVID–19 
deaths in the United States as of the date of 
introduction of this resolution; 
Whereas the decision of the Supreme Court 
of the United States in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 
U.S. 581 (1999), established the right of people 
with disabilities to be independent and sup-
ported in their homes and communities; 
Whereas lack of access to technology and 
broadband internet among people of color, 
low-income and rural communities, older 
adults, and people with disabilities has nega-
tively impacted the well-being of those peo-
ple, particularly during the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas, on any given night in 2019, well 
over 550,000 people were unhoused in the 
United States; 
Whereas, in 2019, in the United States, 1 in 
7 children, more than 1 in 4 Black children, 
and more than 1 in 5 Latino and Indigenous 
children lived in poverty; 
Whereas youth suicide rates are rising, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S962 
March 1, 2021 
Whereas nurses, care and social assistance 
workers, and educators— 
(1) have been first responders during cli-
mate disasters and extreme weather events; 
(2) are essential for responding to other 
forms of environmental harm; and 
(3) have taken grave personal risks to help 
the people they serve; 
Whereas worsening climate impacts will 
make care work more necessary and care 
more difficult to administer, disproportion-
ately impacting children, older adults, and 
people with disabilities, who risk being sepa-
rated from their regular care workers and 
caregivers; 
Whereas, despite the prevalence of low 
wages and difficult conditions, direct care 
jobs, including home care, residential care, 
and nursing assistant jobs, are already 
among the fastest growing in the the United 
States and represent the largest occupa-
tional group in the country; 
Whereas 
communities 
devastated 
by 
deindustrialization and disinvestment are 
particularly reliant on care and social assist-
ance work for employment; 
Whereas many care, social assistance, and 
education jobs are relatively low-carbon oc-
cupations, and can quickly become green 
jobs as certain physical infrastructures 
decarbonize, 
especially 
transit 
systems, 
health care facilities, and public buildings; 
Whereas a robust care workforce will also 
be required to support a just transition to a 
healthy, zero-carbon economy, as other 
workers shift to new industries, move across 
the country, and develop new care needs; 
Whereas the multiple crises now facing the 
United States require not only unprece-
dented investments in physical infrastruc-
ture, but also similarly sized investments in 
social infrastructure, including care infra-
structure; 
Whereas public investment in care work 
supports care workers’ increased economic 
activity, creating additional jobs throughout 
the economy; 
Whereas we have a historic opportunity to 
finally build care infrastructure that is equi-
table and inclusive, and one in which all peo-
ple can thrive, prosper, weather future dis-
ruptions, and age with dignity in their own 
homes and communities; and 
Whereas, in the context of addressing and 
defeating the COVID–19 pandemic, economic 
crisis, systemic racism, and climate change, 
and taking seriously the mandate to ‘‘pro-
mote the general Welfare’’, bold investments 
in care can anchor the rebirth of the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) it is the duty of the Federal Govern-
ment to dramatically expand and strengthen 
the care economy, healing and supporting 
the country as we emerge from the COVID– 
19 pandemic and face the challenges of the 
21st century and beyond; 
(2) the obligation described in paragraph 
(1) can only be met with far-reaching public 
investments, designed to achieve the goals 
of— 
(A) repairing the wrongs of history, includ-
ing by— 
(i) acknowledging and addressing the leg-
acies of exclusion and oppression faced by 
caregivers and care workers, particularly 
women of color and immigrants; 
(ii) acknowledging and addressing the trau-
ma of all those with unmet care needs, such 
as people of color, including Black, Brown, 
and Indigenous people and Asian Americans 
and 
Pacific 
Islanders, 
immigrant, 
LGBTQIA+, older, low-income, rural, and 
deindustrialized communities, people with 
disabilities, 
the 
unemployed, 
under-
employed, unhoused, people who are incar-
cerated or who were formerly incarcerated, 
veterans, survivors of abuse, and children 
and young people coping with economic and 
climate disruption; and 
(iii) approaching care policy as part of a 
broader agenda of dismantling systemic rac-
ism, sexism, economic inequality, and other 
forms of oppression, alongside efforts to 
achieve truth and reconciliation, repara-
tions, decarceration, restorative justice, In-
digenous sovereignty, a fair and humane im-
migration system, demilitarization, a Fed-
eral jobs guarantee, and economic, environ-
mental, and climate justice for all; 
(B) raising pay, benefits, protections, and 
standards for existing care workers, such 
that— 
(i) care jobs are family sustaining, paying 
substantially more than $15 an hour and of-
fering generous benefits; 
(ii) all care workers have— 
(I) the right, and have pathways, to 
unionize; 
(II) the ability to engage in collective ac-
tion; and 
(III) full labor protections, including those 
specified in the Domestic Workers Bill of 
Rights Act; 
(iii) all care workers who wish to form 
worker-owned cooperatives have access to 
resources and technical support with which 
to do so; 
(iv) all care workers have access to ample 
training opportunities, apprenticeships, and 
career ladders leading to higher compensa-
tion, along with other resources and support, 
including funding to facilitate those oppor-
tunities; 
(v) all care workers have the mandated em-
ployer protections they need to conduct 
their work safely in general, and in the event 
of a pandemic, infectious disease outbreak, 
or other disaster, including having optimal 
personal protective equipment, optimal iso-
lation protocols, testing and contact tracing, 
and paid days off due to exposure or illness; 
(vi) all care workers are safe from work-
place violence, harassment, and threats to 
health; and 
(vii) all undocumented workers have path-
ways to citizenship and full and equal access 
to all public benefits, including health, nu-
trition, and income support; 
(C) creating millions of new care jobs over 
the next decade, including as part of existing 
and new public jobs programs, subject to the 
same principles in subparagraph (B), in the 
context of the COVID–19 pandemic recovery, 
the Green New Deal, and any similar efforts 
to meet the challenges and opportunities of 
the 21st century; 
(D) building and expanding zero-carbon, 
non-polluting, climate-safe infrastructure, 
including physical infrastructure and social 
infrastructure, to guarantee care to all peo-
ple throughout the life cycle, moving the 
United States toward universal, public pro-
grams ensuring— 
(i) high-quality health care, including com-
prehensive and noncoercive mental health 
care coverage, substance use treatment, and 
reproductive care, free at the point of serv-
ice; 
(ii) free, high-quality home and commu-
nity-based services, without income or asset 
tests and without waiting lists, which would 
fix the institutional bias of the current sys-
tem, and allow people with disabilities and 
older adults to receive needed support and 
live self-directed lives; 
(iii) free, high-quality childcare and early 
childhood education with a focus on the first 
1,000 days of life, and robust, culturally re-
sponsive, and diverse care settings to achieve 
healthy child development; 
(iv) paid family and medical leave of at 
least 6 months, with full wage replacement; 
and 
(v) additional support for unpaid care-
givers, people with disabilities, older adults, 
and children, with the goal of eradicating 
child poverty; and 
(E) building and expanding other zero-car-
bon, non-polluting, climate-safe infrastruc-
ture and jobs that are intimately connected 
to the care infrastructure described in sub-
paragraph (D), to meet the fundamental ma-
terial, developmental, emotional, and social 
needs of all people, including— 
(i) clean air and water; 
(ii) public, permanently affordable, and 
dignified housing and transit systems, inte-
grated with adequate social services to sup-
port residents of all ages and abilities; 
(iii) safe, accessible infrastructure, includ-
ing public accommodations, schools, work-
places, housing, transit, and streets allowing 
for full mobility for all people; 
(iv) public education, with a focus on social 
and emotional learning, unleashing cre-
ativity in the arts and sciences, and edu-
cating and nurturing the whole child, and in-
cluding fully funded programs for high-need 
students; 
(v) healthy, nourishing, and sustainable 
food systems that provide affordable, acces-
sible, and culturally appropriate foods; 
(vi) comprehensive public health and emer-
gency preparedness infrastructure, including 
equitable, democratic response and recovery 
efforts during and after climate disasters; 
(vii) clear opportunities for, and the re-
moval of barriers to, unionization and collec-
tive action in all economic sectors, including 
the service, technology, and gig work sec-
tors; 
(viii) a Federal minimum wage of at least 
$15 an hour, indexed to the cost of living, and 
the elimination of subminimum wages for 
people with disabilities, tipped workers, and 
all other workers; 
(ix) expanded leisure time, with no loss in 
pay or benefits; 
(x) generous, paid sick days and vacation 
time; 
(xi) support for worker ownership, worker- 
owned cooperatives, and safety and democ-
racy in the workplace, so that workers have 
meaningful influence over their conditions of 
work and the decisions that affect their 
lives; 
(xii) adequate public services and programs 
to support all people in navigating economic 
and social challenges, including navigating 
life on a rapidly warming planet, and to help 
all people unleash their full potential as 
human beings; 
(xiii) public libraries, community centers, 
and other spaces that foster creativity, con-
nection, mental health, and human develop-
ment; 
(xiv) support for practicing and aspiring 
artists, as well as institutions, venues, and 
platforms that empower and fairly com-
pensate artists, bringing their work to wider 
audiences, and integrating the arts into com-
munity mental health, education, and resil-
ience efforts; 
(xv) access to nature, public space, diverse 
forms of public recreation, and technology, 
including public broadband internet; and 
(xvi) mechanisms for democratic oversight 
of data, algorithmic, and technological sys-
tems, along with worker and community 
participation in the development and appli-
cation of those systems, in service of expand-
ing and improving care and social infrastruc-
tures; 
(3) any COVID–19 relief and economic re-
covery legislation must prioritize and invest 
in care infrastructure as a down payment on 
building 
an

mitted the following concurrent resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Rules and Administration: 
S. CON. RES. 7 
Whereas January 6, 2021, the day during 
which insurrectionists stormed the United 
States Capitol (referred to in this preamble 
as the ‘‘Capitol’’) as Members of Congress 
convened in a joint session to receive the 
votes of the Electoral College, will forever be 
remembered as an assault on democracy; 
Whereas many agencies, including the 
United States Capitol Police, the Metropoli-
tan Police Department of the District of Co-
lumbia, neighboring local law enforcement 
agencies, and multiple Federal agencies, re-
sponded to the Capitol and bravely engaged 
the attackers; 
Whereas, despite the attack on the Capitol, 
Members of Congress later returned to the 
task of receiving the votes of the Electoral 
College for President and Vice President, 
thereby ensuring that democracy would pre-
vail that day; 
Whereas Members of Congress, congres-
sional staff, Capitol personnel, and members 
of the media— 
(1) were at work inside the Capitol as it 
was attacked; and 
(2) shared the experience of fearing for 
their safety as thousands of rioters sur-
rounded and occupied areas of the Capitol 
complex, including the Rotunda, Statuary 
Hall, and the Senate Chamber; 
Whereas the staff of the Parliamentarian 
of the Senate acted quickly and selflessly to 
preserve the electoral vote certifications 
from theft or destruction by those attempt-
ing to prevent Congress from carrying out 
the constitutional duty of Congress to re-
ceive the votes of the Electoral College; 
Whereas members of the Capitol custodial 
staff and Restaurant Associates staff have 
bravely shown up to work, and maintained 
the standard of excellence set by such staff, 
during a dangerous pandemic, continuing to 
provide essential services to the congres-
sional community; 
Whereas the dedicated staff of the Archi-
tect of the Capitol, who care for and main-
tain the Capitol, immediately began working 
to repair the parts of the Capitol that were 
damaged and vandalized during this tragic 
event; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
have already taken notice of the incredible 
and diligent work done by Capitol personnel 
to care for and repair the building in the 
wake of the January 6 attack, including by 
sending thank you notes to the Capitol cus-
todial staff; 
Whereas journalists continued to report to 
the world what was happening even as those 
journalists were threatened, chased, sur-
rounded, subjected to physical violence, 
forced to shelter in place for hours, and had 
their equipment stolen and destroyed by ri-
oters; 
Whereas several members of the media 
were physically assaulted during the attack 
on the Capitol, including a photojournalist 
who, once the press credentials of the photo-
journalist were noticed by attackers, was 
thrown to the floor, causing the photo-
journalist to fear for her life; and 
Whereas, due to the work of journalists 
who persisted in covering and documenting 
the events of the day despite the danger 
those journalists faced, the whole story of 
January 6 will be known: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That the Senate— 
(1) commends the service and profes-
sionalism of the personnel of the United 
States Capitol who, under extraordinarily 
difficult circumstances, ensured Congress 
was able to continue to operate and fulfill 
the constitutional obligations of Congress; 
and 
(2) expresses appreciation for, and soli-
darity with, the women and men of the news 
media reporting on the work of Congress, 
even at risk to their own personal safety.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SECURI-
TIES AND EXCHANGE COMMIS-
SION REAL ESTATE LEASING AU-
THORITY REVOCATION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion Real Estate Leasing Authority Revocation 
Act, which would revoke the real estate leas-
ing authority of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC). Since the SEC was grant-
ed leasing authority in 1990, before I came to 
Congress, the SEC has consistently stumbled 
through leasing mistakes at great expense to 
taxpayers. It is time for Congress to end this 
fiasco and return the leasing authority to the 
General Services Administration (GSA), the 
federal government’s real estate arm, like 
other federal agencies. 
When Congress exempted the SEC from 
GSA regulations and directives in 1990, it ex-
pressed its clear intent that ‘‘the authority 
granted to the Commission to lease its own of-
fice space directly will be exercised vigorously 
by the Commission to achieve actual cost sav-
ings and to increase the Commission’s pro-
ductivity and efficiency.’’ (H.R. Conf. Rep. 
101–924.) Over the past 30 years, none of 
that has come to fruition. 
The SEC did not even establish a Leasing 
Branch until April 2009, and did not put into 
place any leasing policies or procedures until 
August 2010. Before that, in May 2005, the 
SEC 
disclosed 
that 
it 
had 
identified 
unbudgeted costs of approximately $48 million 
attributable to misestimates and omissions of 
costs associated with the construction of its 
headquarters near Union Station. In 2007, 
after moving into its headquarters, the SEC 
shuffled its employees to different office 
spaces at a cost of over $3 million without any 
cost-benefit analysis or justifiable rationale. 
In the summer of 2010, the SEC’s Office of 
Administrative Services (OAS) conducted a 
deeply flawed and unsound analysis to justify 
the need for the SEC to lease 900,000 square 
feet of space at Constitution Center and to 
commit over $500 million over 10 years, over-
estimating the amount of space needed by 
over 300 percent. In addition to this gross 
overestimation of space, OAS failed to provide 
complete and accurate information and pre-
pared a faulty and backdated Justification and 
Approval after it had already signed the lease. 
As a former chair and ranking member of 
the Subcommittee on Economic Development, 
Public Buildings, and Emergency Manage-
ment, I was deeply involved in oversight of the 
SEC’s real estate activities in the District of 
Columbia after the agency engaged in this im-
proper sole-source procurement of nearly one 
million square feet of leased space. We held 
two hearings on this subject in 2011. At the 
first hearing, titled ‘‘The Security and Ex-
change Commission’s $500 Million Fleecing of 
America,’’ SEC Inspector General H. David 
Kotz testified that employees ignored the SEC 
chair’s explicit instructions and engaged in 
possible criminal violations in a sole-source 
procurement. He also supported stripping the 
SEC of leasing authority if the SEC did not un-
dertake major reforms. I agreed with Inspector 
General Kotz’s evaluation and introduced leg-
islation to revoke the SEC’s leasing authority 
for the first time. 
At the second hearing, titled ‘‘The Security 
and Exchange Commission’s $500 Million 
Fleecing of America: Part Two,’’ SEC Chair-
woman Mary L. Schapiro testified that ‘‘the 
SEC recognizes the benefits of having [GSA] 
manage the Commission’s future lease acqui-
sitions. Leasing is not part of the Commis-
sion’s core mission and we cannot allow it to 
impede that mission.’’ She then explained that 
the SEC would pare down its leasing program 
‘‘solely to liaise with GSA.’’ This arrangement, 
in which GSA manages SEC leasing activities, 
was memorialized in a Memorandum of Un-
derstanding between GSA and the SEC on 
August 1, 2011. 
Today, I have concerns that the SEC is 
going back on the commitment it made to 
Congress, which is why I am reintroducing this 
bill. In August 2016, GSA and the SEC en-
tered into an Occupancy Agreement to author-
ize GSA to conduct the process for a new 15- 
year lease. In December 2016, GSA, with the 
approval of the SEC, submitted a prospectus 
to the House Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure for approximately 1,274,000 
rentable square feet for the SEC. Congress 
approved this prospectus in 2018, and by July 
2019, GSA had received final bids, resolved 
all protests and even selected a final bidder. 
A month later, in August 2019, the SEC can-
celed the Occupancy Agreement with GSA, 
citing concerns about the value of the pur-
chase option that was part of the lease, con-
cerns the SEC refused to document to Con-
gress. The SEC effectively vetoed the entire 
procurement process despite not having the 
authority or funding mechanism to exercise 
the purchase option without GSA’s involve-
ment. After a few more months of impasse, 
the SEC requested that GSA cancel the pro-
curement and commence a new procurement 
process. 
In all this back and forth between two agen-
cies navigating a convoluted authority struc-
ture, a multi-million-dollar procurement funded 
by taxpayers has gone to waste, adding to the 
hundreds of millions of dollars the SEC has 
previously squandered in its real estate en-
deavors. These public blunders also risk un-
dermining the reputation of GSA and the fed-
eral government among developers and build-
ing owners that participate in these lease pro-
curements and ultimately driving up the costs 
of all GSA real estate procurements due to the 
threat of uncertainty. This also means that the 
SEC will continue to engage in short-term 
leases at a premium while the procurement 
process plays out again, instead of quickly 
transitioning to a more cost-effective long-term 
lease as planned. Congress created this con-
fusion by granting the SEC leasing authority, 
and now Congress must fix it by revoking that 
authority. 
The SEC’s mission is to protect investors; 
maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; 
and facilitate capital formation. GSA’s mission 
is to provide other civilian federal agencies 
with workspace and furnishings at best value 
to the taxpayer. As the SEC has demonstrated 
over three decades, it is incredibly inefficient, 
wasteful and redundant to have the SEC in-
volved in the nuances of real estate decisions 
when GSA exists for that very reason. Like 
other federal agencies, the SEC would con-
tinue to have input and involvement in the de-
cision-making process, but the ultimate real 
estate authority would lie with GSA, where it 
belongs. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

the City of Hot Springs and Arkansas’ Fourth 
Congressional District, Ms. Millie Patrick. She 
passed away on Friday, February 12, 2021, 
after years of hard work and sacrifice for her 
beloved community. 
Described by those closest to her as a won-
derful friend, Ms. Patrick worked with the 
Greater Hot Springs Chamber of Commerce

for over two decades. During this time, she 
also served as director for Hot Springs Lead-
ership Adult Classes until her retirement in 
2020 and as Vice President of Retirement and 
Relocation. 
Born June 28, 1932, in Kansas, Ms. Patrick 
later made Arkansas home with her husband, 
Gene Patrick. Together, they had two daugh-
ters, three grandchildren, and several nieces 
and nephews. As a member of Piney Grove 
United Methodist Church and an avid water- 
skier until the age of 86, Ms. Patrick was 
known to be an active woman. Referred to by 
her friends and colleagues as a ‘‘wonderful 
soul and a true ambassador for Hot Springs,’’ 
Ms. Patrick shines as a true example of joyful 
service. 
I take this time today to honor the life of 
service exemplified by Ms. Millie Patrick. I 
thank her and her family for their dedication to 
our fellow citizens and our beloved Fourth Dis-
trict.

HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Delone Catholic High 
School Squirettes basketball coach Gerry 
Eckenrode on his 500th victory as head 
coach. 
Coach Eckenrode began his tenure with 
Delone’s girls’ basketball team as head coach

ership, Delone Catholic has won four state 
championships, four district championships, 
and 14 division titles. His teams have ex-
celled, winning at least 18 games per season. 
Coach Eckenrode has coached five of the 
school’s 1,000-point scorers. Additionally, he 
has a robust legacy of mentoring new coach-
es. 
Congratulations to Coach Gerry Eckenrode 
and the entire Delone Catholic girls’ basketball 
community on this remarkable achievement. 
As he continues to lead the Delone Catholic 
Squirettes, I wish Coach Eckenrode and his 
team all the best.

PEACE CORPS REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to reintroduce the ‘‘Peace Corps 
Reauthorization Act’’ on today, the 60th anni-
versary of the Peace Corps’ founding and the 
start of National Peace Corps Week. I want to 
thank my fellow Congressional Peace Corps 
Caucus co-chair Representative GRAVES (R– 
LA), as well as Representatives MENG (D– 
NY), RADEWAGEN (R–AS), PHILLIPS (D–MN), 
CASE (D–HI), and SIRES (D–NJ), for their sup-
port as original cosponsors. 
Like successive generations of young Amer-
icans, my wife Patti and I answered President 
John F. Kennedy’s call and served in the 
Peace Corps in Ethiopia from 1966 to 1968. 
This foundational experience inspired our life-
time of service that continued into California 
state government, the Clinton Administration, 
and now the United States Congress. 
Since the establishment of the Peace Corps 
in 1961, more than 230,000 American volun-
teers have served in some 141 countries 
around the world. Due to the ongoing global 
COVID–19 pandemic, the Peace Corps was 
forced to recall all volunteers serving in 65 
countries in March 2020. Now more than ever, 
Congress must support the Peace Corps’ mis-
sion and realize President Kennedy’s vision of 
generations of young Americans, ready to 
serve their nation and make the world a better 
place. 
Our ‘‘Peace Corps Reauthorization Act’’ 
would do just that by providing additional fed-
eral resources to better support current and 
returned volunteers. This bipartisan bill would 
also provide the funding necessary to redeploy 
Peace Corps volunteers once it is safe to do 
so after the COVID–19 pandemic subsides, 
with the goal of finally reaching 10,000 volun-
teers serving annually around the world. 
This bipartisan bill builds upon the Sam Farr 
and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–256) and the Kate 
Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act 
of 2011 (Public Law 112–57) sponsored by 
former Congressman Ted Poe (R–TX). The 
bill also builds upon legislation sponsored by 
former Congressman Sam Farr (D–CA), who 
served in the Peace Corps in Colombia from 
1964 to 1966. 
As co-chair of the Congressional Peace 
Corps Caucus, I continue working in support 
of the Peace Corps’ mission, its volunteers, 
and the indelible impact their service has on 
the lives of needy people the world over. Con-
gress last reauthorized the Peace Corps in 
1999 (Public Law 106–30), expiring at the end 
of fiscal year 2003. So, my bipartisan ‘‘Peace 
Corps Reauthorization Act’’ is long overdue. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to working 
with the new Foreign Affairs Committee Chair-
man GREGORY W. MEEKS (D–NY) and Rank-
ing Member MICHAEL MCCAUL (R–TX) to pass 
the ‘‘Peace Corps Reauthorization Act’’ this 
Congress. I encourage all members of the 
House to cosponsor this bipartisan bill.

HONORING WILEY RICKMAN WHITE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Wiley 
Rickman White. Mr. White was born January 
14, 1931 in Mounds, Oklahoma. He was the 
ninth born of 10 children to the union of 
Norecker Harrell and Frank Joseph White. Mr. 
White grew up in a Christian family where 
Christian values were instilled and reinforced 
by his parents and their Church. 
He attended public schools in Mounds and 
graduated from Wheatly High School where 
he played football. 
Mr. White was an exceptional athlete at his 
High School and as a result of his abilities, he 
earned a football scholarship to attend Jack-
son State University in Mississippi where he 
displayed his talent on the field as a member 
of the JSU Tigers football team for four years 
as an undergraduate. Later, Mr. White was 
honored by his Alma Mater by being inducted 
in the Sports Hall of Fame wherein he was the 
35th athlete to be inducted into the Hall of 
Fame in the University’s 103-year existence. 
As an honoree Mr. White was presented a 
plaque and a medal. 
Mr. White was also a very good student 
where he maintained a 3.5 grade average and 
was a Charter Member of The Delta Delta 
Chapter, Kappa Alpha Psi, Fraternity, Inc. Mr. 
White completed college and earned a Bach-
elor of Arts Degree even while his studies 
were temporarily interrupted to serve his time 
in the U.S. Military where he moved up in the 
ranks as Sergeant in the U.S. Army serving in 
the Korean War. He earned an Honorable Dis-
charge in 1960. 
Jackson State University is where Mr. White 
met the love of his life, Miriam H. Webb. The 
two married on December 22, 1951 and wel-
comed two children into the family during the 
mid-sixties. After finishing college and fulfilling 
his service obligation the two moved to Los 
Angeles, California in 1955. There, Mr. White 
worked at Markham Jr. High School as a 
physical education instructor. Because of his 
love for sports and athleticism, Mr. White 
began officiating high school basketball sport-
ing events. He was later recognized by the 
IAABO (International Association of Approved 
Basketball Officials) as the first negro ever 
elected Secretary Treasurer of the organiza-
tion. The IAABO is the largest organization of 
its kind in the world where they have jurisdic-
tion over all high schools, semipro, and small 
college basketball officials. Mr. White also 
taught and coached football at Jordan High 
School in Los Angeles. 
Education was very important to Mr. White 
and he enrolled in The University of Southern 
California (USC) where he received a master’s 
degree in business administration. Mr. White 
then expanded his career in teaching and 
worked as an educator/administrator in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District for 30 plus 
years and held positions as a classroom 
teacher, assistant counselor, assistant reg-
istrar, coach, youth service director, student 
body advisor, and vice principal mainly at the 
high school level until he officially retired in 
1992. 
From 1968 through 1969 Wiley and his 
beautiful wife Miriam, built their dream home 
in Baldwin Hills, CA and moved their family 
into the home where they raised their children. 
The home was the site for many family par-
ties, gatherings, holiday dinners, reunions, re-
hearsals, and meetings where he hosted nu-
merous Jackson State University Alumni meet-
ings and served as the Alumni’s President for 
the Los Angeles Chapter. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the late Mr. Wiley Rickman 
White.

HONORING THE WORK OF WHITKO 
CAREER ACADEMY 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Whitko Career Academy in Whitley 
County for their impressive and important work 
to help young Hoosiers succeed in the 21st 
century workforce. Part of Whitko Community 
Schools in Larwill, Whitko Career Academy 
was founded in September 2019 to help cre-
ate career opportunities for students in the 
surrounding community. 
Upwards of 500 students walk through the 
doors of the academy each day. Inside, each 
student engages in hands-on, skills-based 
learning. Made possible through partnerships 
with The 80/20 Foundation Trust and The 
Whitley County Community Foundation, the 
academy gives these students the tools they 
need to pursue livelihoods in manufacturing, 
engineering, agriculture, technology, education 
and more. 
Earlier this month, the academy formed a 
three-way partnership with WishBone Medical 
Inc. in Warsaw and Red Star Contract Manu-
facturing to bolster the academy’s engineering 
curriculum. Students will be manufacturing 
components for one of Wish Bone’s pediatric 
medical devices. This year, the academy will 
also serve as the home of the Whitko Agricul-
tural Program and Future Farmers of Amer-
ica—organizations together dedicated to train-
ing the next generation of leaders in agri-
culture. 
In the year and a half since its founding, 
Whitko Career Academy has established itself 
as a model for career and technical education. 
Hoosiers are thankful for, and proud of, this in-
stitution for the immediate impact it has 
brought to northeast Indiana. This record is 
testament to the life-changing education hun-
dreds of young Hoosiers have received, and 
will continue to receive, at the Whitko Career 
Academy for years to come.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
REMINGTON KRISTINE VINEY 
HON. ADAM KINZINGER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Remington Kristine 
Viney, who passed away on Tuesday, Feb-
ruary 16, 2021, at the age of 26. Through pas-
sion for aviation and flying, Remington dedi-
cated herself to service as a member of the 
Wisconsin Air National Guard. Remington was 
always flying in the seat of an airplane sur-
rounded by miles of breathtaking sky doing 
what she loved. 
On March 14, 1994, Remington was born in 
Madison, Wisconsin, daughter to Kevin and 
Tia (Scanlon) Viney. She would then graduate 
with honors from Sun Prairie High School in 
2012, earn an associate degree in tactical air-
craft maintenance, and then receive a Bach-
elor of Business Administration degree from 
UW-Madison in 2017. Her accomplishments 
were many, but her most memorable asset 
and what was most important to her was the 
depth and breadth of her relationships with 
family and friends. 
Remington was passionate about any ad-
venture that life had to offer and obtained her 
pilot license in high school. While in college, 
she was the captain of the Wisconsin Flying 
Team. Additionally, she was a founding mem-
ber of the Women in Aviation, Madison chap-
ter. Remington enlisted in the Wisconsin Air 
National Guard in 2013 where she proudly 
served through several deployments and ob-
tained the rank of staff sergeant. She pursued 
accreditations and licensing to receive her 
commercial pilot license in addition to becom-
ing a flight instructor. Further, Remington was 
working on a degree in Airframe and Power-
plant Mechanics. 
During her service in the Air National Guard, 
Remington met the love of her life, fellow serv-
ice member, Kyle Henry. They shared so 
much together, including her passion for real 
estate, flying, and raising her future stepson, 
Kellan. Above all else, her family was the an-
chor of her life, and she was so excited for her 
future with her fiance´, Kyle. 
Madam Speaker, I want to express my con-
dolences, but encourage family, friends, and 
the community to celebrate the life of Rem-
ington Kristine Viney, for her service to our 
country and love for life. My thoughts and 
prayers remain with her family and friends dur-
ing this difficult time.

IN TRIBUTE TO DR. JOAN M. 
PRINCE 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Dr. Joan M. 
Prince, the Vice Chancellor of Global Inclusion 
and Engagement at the University of Wis-
consin-Milwaukee (UWM). After more than two 
decades of working with distinction and serv-
ing her alma mater, she is retiring on March 
1, 2021. 
Dr. Prince’s education career with UWM 
began as a promising freshman when she was 
16 years old. She was the first African Amer-
ican recipient of a bachelor’s in medical tech-
nology and a master’s in clinical laboratory 
science. She joined St. Joseph’s Hospital as a 
hematologist and, in 1988, she became the 
supervisor in hematology for the Medical 
Science Labs. Around the same time, she 
began working for the University of Wiscon-
sin’s Medical school where she implemented 
the Health Professional Partnership Initiative’s 
collaborative project as lead strategist. 
Equipped with a strong educational back-
ground and a breadth of experience, she 
began her 20–year career with UWM when 
she was appointed Vice Chancellor in 2000. 
She went on to earn a Ph.D. from UWM in 
Urban Education, with a focus on STEM edu-
cation. At UWM she is also the Chief Adminis-
trator for the Divisions of Global Inclusion and 
Engagement, and Partnerships and Innova-
tion, with responsibilities as the University’s 
Chief Inclusion Officer. She led campus-wide 
project areas such as the STEM Inspire Pipe-
line, the Inclusive Internationalization Projects, 
Global Partnerships in STEM, Center for Inter-
national Health, Carnegie Engagement Classi-
fication team, Center for Community Solutions, 
and Equity and Diversity Services. Dr. Prince 
has led many important campus-wide initia-
tives that include the establishment of the first 
anti-bias training curriculum, as well as the for-
mation of a program dedicated to advancing 
historically underrepresented students and 
first-generation students in the STEM field. 
Outside of work, Dr. Prince’s commitment to 
community service extended to working to 
meet the needs of students in underserved 
communities, including minorities, women, 
children, entrepreneurs and small businesses. 
She served in a variety of leadership posi-
tions, civic organizations and was board mem-
ber and governance chair of The Council on 
Foundations, 
the 
International 
Foundation 
Membership Association and the Urban Librar-
ies Council. She is also a corporate board di-
rector of Managed Health Services, a sub-
sidiary of the Centene Corporation, a director 
emeritus of C. G. Schmidt Construction Com-
pany and a corporate director of Great Lakes 
Higher Education Corporation. 
Dr. Prince has received recognition and nu-
merous awards for her commitment to com-
munity service from civic and professional or-
ganizations such as The Business Journal’s 
Woman of Influence award, The Community 
Leadership award (Thurgood Marshall Schol-
arship Fund) and the Friends of the Hispanic 
Community award. She was named one of the 
ten most powerful women in Milwaukee in the 
February 2006 issue of Milwaukee Magazine 
and is featured as an honoree in the national 
2008 Black Women in Sisterhood Distin-
guished Black Women calendar. She is also 
spotlighted as a nominee in the national Afri-
can American oral history archival project, The 
History Makers. 
On September 12, 2012, Dr. Prince was 
nominated by President Barack Obama to the 
key administrative post of alternate represent-
ative to the 67th General Assembly of the 
United Nations with the honorary rank of am-
bassador. This diplomatic position also main-
tained an appointment position as Senior Advi-
sor to the State Department and Public Dele-
gate. 
Dr. Prince leaves behind a legacy of a long 
list of accomplishments. She is someone that 
cares deeply about her former students, the 
individuals she mentored, her colleagues and 
the greater community. For the more than 25 
years that I have had the pleasure of knowing 
and working with her, she has been a tremen-
dous force in the City of Milwaukee, the State 
of Wisconsin and the United States. Madam 
Speaker, I am so proud to honor Dr. Joan M. 
Prince and to call her a friend. I wish her 
much success as she transitions into this new 
phase of her life.

IN MEMORY OF JAMES ‘‘JIM’’ E. 
ALTY, SR. 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor James ‘‘Jim’’ E. Alty, Sr., a Vietnam 
hero and active member of the seacoast com-
munity, who passed in late January at the age 
of 86. Through both his military service and 
his subsequent community engagement, he is 
remembered as a shining example of Amer-
ican fortitude, ingenuity, and empathy. 
While Jim worked at General Electric for 15 
years, he also served his country for 20 years 
in the U.S. Air Force, which included two tours 
in Vietnam as part of the crash and rescue 
team, before retiring in 1973. In Vietnam, 
Jim’s bases were frequently targeted by rocket 
and mortar attacks, which included the Octo-
ber 2, 1968 attack that left four airmen dead. 
Jim never forgot those he served with and 
honored them with a list of their names in his 
wallet 
In his retirement, he engaged heavily in 
community service. His involvement included 
membership on the Dover HUB Family Re-
source Board, an organization that provides 
family education services, as well as volun-
teered with local police and correctional de-
partments on reentry projects. 
Jim also advocated for veterans’ health 
services as he was also familiar with the reali-
ties and struggles many face when returning 
from war and readjusting to life outside of 
combat. One of his proudest accomplishments 
was aiding in the opening of the new 
Somersworth VA Clinic in 2019. Jim also cre-
ated the Dover veterans support group, Bets 
for Vets, and frequently transported fellow vet-
erans from Manchester to Boston to ensure 
they received necessary counseling and med-
ical treatment. 
On behalf of all of my constituents in New 
Hampshire’s First Congressional District, I 
share my condolences to Jim’s sister and 
brothers, three children, five grandchildren, 
and many nieces and nephews. As we recog-
nize Mr. Alty, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring his rich life and legacy. May his memory 
be a blessing.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HAMBURG 
MAYOR DANE WEINDORF 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Mayor of Ham-
burg, Dane Alan Weindorf. He passed away at 
the age of 75 on Saturday, February 20, 2021, 
leaving behind a community of friends and a 
legacy of hard work, sacrifice, and service. 
After opening his first local grocery store in 
1972, Mayor Weindorf grew his business to 
seven grocery stores in what came to be 
known as Joe and Dane Enterprises, or 
JADE’s chain of stores. Weindorf retired with 
30 years of service in the industry, which led 
to his desire to continue doing great things for 
his community. He was elected Mayor shortly 
after his retirement, and he worked on a vari-
ety of projects that led Hamburg to further 
success, such as renovations to city parks, the 
baseball park, and a new fire station. 
Born on September 20, 1946, in Minnesota, 
Mayor Weindorf was one of six siblings. He 
and wife, Annette, of 38 years have two sons, 
two daughters, eight grandchildren, and seven 
grandchildren. With his passion for his large 
family and membership at First Baptist Church 
of Hamburg, Mayor Weindorf was known not 
just for his service, but also for his emphasis 
on personal relationships, friendship, and fel-
lowship with his community. 
I take this time today to honor the life of 
service exemplified by Mayor Weindorf. I 
thank him and his family for their dedication to 
our fellow citizens and our beloved Fourth Dis-
trict.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE VICTIMS 
OF THE BAKU AND SUMGAIT PO-
GROMS 
AND 
THE 
2020 
AZER-
BAIJANI ATTACKS ON ARTSAKH 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 33rd Anniversary of the 
Sumgait pogrom and the 31st Anniversary of 
the Baku pogrom. 
On February 27, 1988, hundreds of Arme-
nian civilians living in the city of Sumgait in 
Azerbaijan were indiscriminately killed, raped, 
maimed, and even burned alive because of 
their ethnicity. Hostile, anti-Armenian rhetoric 
from Azerbaijani citizens and officials insti-
gated this tragedy. 
Similarly, on January 12, 1990, a seven-day 
pogrom broke out against the Armenian popu-
lation in Baku during which Armenians were 
beaten, murdered, and expelled from the city. 
Over 90 Armenian civilians were killed, over 
700 were injured, and countless others were 
permanently displaced by the ethnic violence 
that ensued. 
For over three decades, Azerbaijan has 
taken steps to cover up these crimes against 
humanity and dismiss the atrocities at Sumgait 
and Baku. Even more disturbing, the Azeri 
government lauded the perpetrators of this 
event and similar violent attacks. 
Tragically, the Azerbaijani government’s ap-
proach toward Armenians has changed little 
since the Sumgait and Baku pogroms. We 
saw similar rhetoric right before Azerbaijan’s 
attacks on Artsakh last fall. Azeri forces, Turk-
ish drones, and Turkish-backed mercenaries 
conducted an indiscriminate bombing cam-
paign against large population centers that 
killed thousands of Armenians and displaced 
tens of thousands more civilians. It also in-
cluded appalling war crimes against Arme-
nians at the hands of Azerbaijani forces and 
foreign mercenaries that included beheadings, 
torture, and other abhorrent acts of violence 
I continue to stand with the Armenian peo-
ple in condemning the horrific pogroms and in 
mourning the loss of those who were sense-
lessly killed in the recent Artsakh attacks. It is 
critical for the United States to recognize and 
denounce violent assaults against any civil-
ians. If we do not condemn or punish crimes 
against humanity and ethnic violence, we be-
come passive bystanders, failing to live up to 
the lessons of the 20th Century and the rights 
of all human to live free from violence and 
persecution based on race, ethnicity, or reli-
gion. These lessons are especially important 
as we prepare to commemorate the 106th An-
niversary of the Armenian Genocide in April. 
I will continue to work with my colleagues 
on the Congressional Armenian Issues Cau-
cus to honor the victims of the Baku and 
Sumgait pogroms and the recent victims of 
Azerbaijani aggressions in Artsakh. I will con-
tinue to condemn all acts of violence against 
people who are targeted simply because of 
who they are. I hope my colleagues will join 
me in rejecting violent rhetoric and intimida-
tion. In doing so, we renew our commitment to 
achieving a lasting peace in the Caucasus.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposi-
tion to H.R. 1319. This $1.9 trillion spending 
package is being considered without meaning-
ful debate and without Republican input. While 
more than 200 Republican amendments were 
proposed, Democrats only accepted two. 
I personally authored five commonsense 
amendments to improve government trans-
parency and accountability, assist juvenile jus-
tice and foster care systems, and address 
concerns with standardized testing. All of them 
were unanimously rejected by Democrats. 
We must take action to address the con-
sequences of the coronavirus pandemic, but 
this bill does not address the concerns of ev-
eryday Americans. It addresses the desires of 
the Majority. It also does not address small

MENSTRUAL EQUITY IN THE 
PEACE CORPS ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, for 60 years, 
Peace Corps has been an enduring symbol of 
peace and friendship between the U.S. and 
our global community. Peace Corps Volun-
teers (PCVs) sacrifice over two years of their 
time, working side by side with local leader-
ship to combat some of the most pressing 
challenges of our generation. 
Unfortunately, I have heard from too many 
PCVs who have struggled to access and af-
ford menstrual products. PCVs, and Returned 
Peace 
Corps 
Volunteers 
(RPCVs) 
have 
shared with me how menstrual products are 
not readily available, or these items are far 
more expensive than they would be in the 
U.S. So many of these volunteers are also 
placed in very remote locations—forcing them 
to travel extremely far distances to access 
menstrual products. 
Additionally, while the Peace Corps Medical 
Officers in some countries provides these 
products for PCVs, volunteers in other coun-
tries are forced to purchase these products 
out of the same limited stipend everyone else 
receives. Other volunteers pay hundreds of 
dollars out-of-pocket to ship these items from 
the U.S. to their country of service, or they 
wait to receive these items in their care pack-
ages from loved ones back home. 
This is simply wrong. Menstrual products 
are not luxury items; they are medical neces-
sities. Menstrual equity is a basic health right 
and human right. 
That is why, today, on the 60th Anniversary 
of Peace Corps, I am reintroducing the Men-
strual Equity in the Peace Corps Act to ensure 
that all PCVs have free and equitable access 
to menstrual products. 
For the 65 percent of PCVs who are 
women, and the more than 90 percent of 
PCVs who are under the age of 50, this is 
simply a matter of equity. The Menstrual Eq-
uity in the Peace Corps Act would direct the 
Peace Corps Director to establish a com-
prehensive policy that makes available free 
menstrual products to PCVs who require 
them, or increase stipends to allow for those 
expenses. 
Today, on the 60th Anniversary of the 
founding of Peace Corps, I recognize the 
bravery of all my constituents who have 
served in Peace Corps, and I am proud to re-
introduce this critical bill that upholds the 
health and safety of all who answer the call to 
serve in Peace Corps. I thank my colleagues 
who have joined me in this critical legislation, 
and I urge its swift passage to ensure men-
strual equity for all Peace Corps Volunteers. 
TRIBUTE FOR THE 60TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
EDWARDS 
V. 
SOUTH CAROLINA MARCH 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to an important anniver-
sary that brings the actions of my youth full 
circle to my service in this esteemed body. 
Sixty years ago, a student-led march took 
place in South Carolina’s capital city protesting 
state laws designed to maintain de jure seg-
regation of Blacks and whites in my home 
state. The arrests that day, March 2, 1961, re-
sulted in the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 
breach of the peace ruling. The case, 
Edwards v. South Carolina, is still taught in 
law schools today. I was among the student 
protestors arrested that day for seeking equal 
justice and civil rights, and I am proud of the 
role this event played in protecting the right to 
protest peacefully in this country. 
On that momentous day, approximately 200 
high school and college students from all over 
South Carolina gathered at Zion Baptist 
Church in Columbia and marched to the State 
House to protest racial discrimination. As a 
20-year-old student protest leader at South 
Carolina State College (now University), I left 
Orangeburg with several of my classmates to 
join in the march. We divided into groups, and 
I agreed to lead a contingency of students 
from my high school Mather Academy toward 
the State House grounds. When we ap-
proached the State House, law enforcement 
officers ordered us to turn around. It had been 
my intention to do just that, but the students 
I was leading wanted to press on. We 
marched on singing hymns and patriotic 
songs. 191 protestors were arrested for 
breaching the peace and spent the next three 
days in jail before being released on bail. 
There were four separate bench trials that 
March and 189 students were convicted in 
Magistrate’s Court despite the exemplary rep-
resentation of NAACP attorney Matthew J. 
Perry and his colleagues, Lincoln Jenkins II 
and Donald Sampson. All but two of the 
protestors appealed their convictions, which 
were upheld by the South Carolina Supreme 
Court. 
On December 13, 1962, the Edwards v. 
South Carolina case, named for Benedict Col-
lege protestor James Edwards, was argued 
before the U.S. Supreme Court by Matthew 
Perry. On February 25, 1963, the high court 
ruled eight to one in favor of the student de-
fendants, reversing their convictions. 
Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority 
opinion that a state cannot ‘‘make criminal the 
peaceful expression of unpopular views.’’ 
Since that ruling, Edwards v. South Carolina 
has been cited as the precedent in more than 
70 breach of the peace cases. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues to join me today in recognizing the 
contributions of the student protestors in 
Edwards v. South Carolina as we remember 
their protest 60 years ago. As one of the 
young people involved in this historic event, I 
can attest that we were committed to the fight 
for civil rights, and had no idea that our ac-
tions would contribute to preserving the right 
to peacefully protest for future generations. 
Today similar tactics are being employed in 
movements like Black Lives Matter. I applaud 
their efforts and thank the City of Columbia, 
Historic Columbia and the University of South 
Carolina for the monument they have erected 
to memorialize this momentous event.

TRIBUTE TO DEACON DAVIES 
JOHNSON 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, to be of service to humanity is one 
of the greatest attributes one can have. Such 
was the life and character traits of Davies 
Johnson. Born and raised in rural Arkansas on 
the border of Louisiana, in the little town of 
Wilmot, Arkansas, Davies married his child-
hood sweetheart Mabel Parker in 1953 and 
migrated to Chicago, Illinois where they made 
their home and their lives. Davies was em-
ployed by the Burlington Railroad where he 
began as a Porter and became a Crane Oper-
ator and retired as a Supervisor after thirty- 
three years. Mr. Johnson was always kind and 
considerate. He was Christian-orientated and 
joined the Lord’s Way Missionary Baptist 
Church in 1973. At Lord’s Way, Mr. Johnson 
served on the Trustee Board, Sunday School 
Superintendent, Chairman of the Deacon 
Board and as anything else the church need-
ed him to do. Deacon Johnson was a stalwart 
in his family and the community where he 
lived. He was a man of high standards and 
was well regarded by all who knew him. The 
world became a better place because Davies 
Johnson lived, and my life was enriched by 
knowing him. May he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF 
JOHN SCHIECHE 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the career of John 
Schieche, Superintendent of the East Valley 
School District, who is retiring after 43 years 
of shaping the next generation of Central 
Washington students. 
As a farmer, it is my duty to highlight the 
fact that John was first exposed to teaching 
during his days managing a 1,500–acre wheat 
farm. It was not uncommon for John to hire 
high school students as farmhands during the 
summer months and teach them how to oper-
ate heavy machinery. This experience made 
for an easy transition into teaching as an auto 
mechanics and shop teacher. 
Over the years, John excelled in all areas of 
education, most recently, he was awared the 
2018 Crystal Apple Award for his dedication to 
advancing school communications. 
John started his journey to becoming super-
intendent in the early 1990’s after being hired 
by the Yakima School District to serve as Di-
rector of the Yakima Valley Technical Skills 
Center. 
During his time in that leadership role, John 
was also pursuing his credentials to become a

superintendent from my alma mater, Wash-
ington State University. Go Cougs. 
John was hired to serve as East Valley’s su-
perintendent in 2002, and during his tenure, 
three of the district’s schools have been rec-
ognized by the state as distinguished schools 
for their teaching and learning methods. 
I wish him all the best as he makes his tran-
sition into retirement and returns to farm life. 
I thank John for everything he has done for 
our districts’ students, and from one lifelong 
farmer to another, try not to work too hard.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1280, THE 
GEORGE FLOYD JUSTICE IN PO-
LICING ACT OF 2021 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 1, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to affirm my support for H.R. 1280, 
the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 
2021. 
Last summer, in the wake of George Floyd’s 
horrific murder, people in communities sweep-
ing the nation and the world took to the streets 
to express anger born of despair. His death 
was not an isolated incident—but another in a 
long, tragic pattern of injustices committed 
against the Black community at the hands of 
law enforcement. And each incident, however 
severe, serves as a sobering reminder of the 
systemic racism still woven into the fabric of 
our institutions. 
For many, the death of George Floyd is 
merely an eye-opening introduction to the 
harsh, unequal application of justice unfairly 
meted on the Black community. But for us, 
this is nothing new. Many decades ago, I re-
member having the conversation with my par-
ents about how to act during a police encoun-
ter. Fast forward to a newer generation, I was 
forced to have that same conversation with my 
son—but it does not stop there. As my son 
raised his three sons, he too had to repeat 
this morbid discussion with my grandsons. For 
far too long, for too many generations, we 
have tolerated and suffered the consequences 
of racism in our way of life. But at this mo-
ment, in the wake of so much pain and grief, 
Congress has a moral responsibility to meet 
the calls for bold and transformative change. 
As such to support federal policies to ad-
dress this ongoing issue, I am proud to be an 
original cosponsor of H.R. 1280, the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act. This proposed 
legislation would: ban the use of no-knock 
warrants and deadly chokeholds; limit the 
transfer of military-grade equipment to police 
departments; and, most importantly, put into 
place several reforms to make it easier to hold 
police officers accountable for misconduct. If 
enacted, the Justice in Policing Act will be a 
critical first—but necessary first—step on the 
path towards racial reconciliation. 
It is important to note that this legislation 
alone cannot right the wrongs of the past, nor 
will it guarantee the total prevention of injus-
tices in the future. Rather, we must empower 
our communities to reimagine public safety in 
an equitable manner. This means rein-
vesting—not defunding—police department re-
sources to prioritize community-based safety 
efforts. Further, I am pleased that the Justice 
in Policing Act supports this proposal by pro-
viding public safety innovation grants for local-
ities to reassess current practices. 
To those who called, wrote, and visited my 
offices to relay your support for this bill, know 
that my vote today lends action to your voices. 
You have inspired me with your dedicated and 
tireless advocacy for justice, and it is because 
of you that I am optimistic for the success of 
our individual and collective cause. 
Black lives matter, Madam Speaker, and it 
is past time that the laws of our nation reflect 
it. That is why I am urging my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this bill. It 
goes sans saying that I strongly encourage its 
immediate consideration and passage in the 
Senate.
