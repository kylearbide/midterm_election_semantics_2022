The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we are gratefully aware 
that You are the giver of every good 
and perfect gift. You shower us with 
Your mercies each day. 
We are further aware of our unwor-
thiness because of Your goodness. We 
all, like sheep, have gone astray. Lord, 
we are prone to wander and to leave 
You, the God we love. 
As our Senators work today, make 
them extensions of Your power in our 
world. Use them as Your eyes, ears, 
hands, and feet to accomplish Your 
purposes. Lord, make them Your am-
bassadors. May they arrange their pri-
orities according to Your will and view 
their challenges from an ethical per-
spective, striving to seek Your will in 
all they think, say, and do. May they 
find, in challenging moments, opportu-
nities to renew their faith in You. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
permission to address the Senate for 1 
minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
want to wish all Iowans and maybe, in 
turn, all Americans a happy New Year. 
As 2020 begins, I am focused on passing 
the United States-Mexico-Canada trade 
agreement. I am leading a meeting of 
the Finance Committee tomorrow to 
report out the bill, so the Senate floor 
vote is imminent. 
I am continuing to work, in a bipar-
tisan way, to lower the cost of pre-
scription drugs with the Grassley- 
Wyden Prescription Drug Pricing Re-
duction Act. 
In the coming weeks, I will begin my 
40th annual 99-county tour of my State 
to continue to hear what is on the 
minds of Iowans so that I can better 
serve them in the U.S. Senate. 
I look forward to remaining in touch 
with Iowans as the new decade begins. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.

IRAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as 
the Senate convenes this afternoon, we 
find our Nation facing two grave and 
serious choices. One concerns our unity 
at home and the future of our Constitu-
tion. The other involves our strength 
abroad and the security of our home-
land. Both situations demand serious, 
sober treatment from Congress. Both 
require that we put enduring national 
interests ahead of the factionalism and 
short-termism the Founding Fathers 
warned us about. But, unfortunately, 
seriousness has been in short supply 
lately—in very short supply—from the 
determined critics of President Trump, 
and our Nation, of course, is worse for 
it. 
Last Thursday, the United States 
took decisive action to end the mur-
derous scheming of Iran’s chief ter-
rorist. Qasem Soleimani had spent nu-
merous years masterminding attacks 
on American servicemembers and our 
partners throughout the Middle East 
and expanding Iran’s influence. Despite 
sanctions and despite prohibitions by 
the U.N. Security Council, he roamed 
throughout the region with impunity. 
His hands bore the blood of more 
American servicemembers than anyone 
else alive. Hundreds of American fami-
lies have buried loved ones because of 
him. Veterans have learned to live with 
permanent injuries inflicted by his ter-
rorists. In Iraq, Syria, and beyond, the

entire region felt the effects of his evil 
tactics. 
We should welcome his death and its 
complication of Tehran’s terrorism-in-
dustrial complex, but we must remain 
vigilant and soberly prepared for even 
further aggression. 
It is completely appropriate that this 
decision would generate interest and 
questions from this body. We can and 
we should learn more about the intel-
ligence and thinking that led to this 
operation and the plan to defend Amer-
ican personnel and interests in the 
wake of it. 
I am glad the administration will 
hold 
an 
all-Senators 
briefing 
on 
Wednesday. It will be led by Secretary 
of Defense Esper, Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley, 
Secretary of State Pompeo, and CIA 
Director Haspel. 
Unfortunately, in this toxic political 
environment, some of our colleagues 
rushed to blame our own government 
before even knowing the facts, rushed 
to split hairs about intelligence before 
being briefed on it, and rushed to down-
play Soleimani’s evil while presenting 
our own President as the villain. 
Soon after the news broke, one of our 
distinguished colleagues made a public 
statement 
that 
rightly 
called 
Soleimani a ‘‘murderer’’ and then, 
amazingly, walked that message back 
when the far left objected to the fac-
tual statement. Since then, I believe 
all of her criticism has been directed at 
our own President. 
Another 
of 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues has been thinking out loud 
about Middle East policy on social 
media. Mere days before President 
Trump’s decision, this Senator tore 
into the White House for what he de-
scribed as weakness and inaction. ‘‘No 
one fears us’’ he complained. ‘‘Trump 
has rendered America impotent in the 
Middle East.’’ But since the strike, he 
has done a complete 180. That same 
Senator has harshly criticized our own 
President for getting tough. Ludi-
crously, he and others on the left have 
accused the administration of commit-
ting an illegal act and equated the re-
moval of this terrorist leader with a 
foreign power assassinating our own 
Secretary of Defense. 
Here is what one expert had to say 
about 
it. 
Jeh 
Johnson, 
President 
Obama’s own former Pentagon general 
counsel and Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, said: 
If you believe everything that our govern-
ment is saying about General Soleimani, he 
was a lawful military objective, and the 
president, under his constitutional authority 
as commander in chief, had ample domestic 
legal authority to take him out without— 
Without— 
an additional congressional authorization. 
Whether he was a terrorist or a general in a 
military force that was engaged in armed at-
tacks against our people, he was a lawful 
military objective. 
That was the former Secretary of 
Homeland Security in the Obama ad-
ministration, Jeh Johnson, an expert 
on these things. 
Our former colleague, Joe Lieber-
man, who ran for Vice President on the 
Democratic ticket in 2000, wrote this 
morning: ‘‘In their uniformly skeptical 
or negative reactions to Soleimani’s 
death, Democrats are . . . creating the 
risk that the U.S. will be seen as acting 
and 
speaking 
with 
less 
authority 
abroad at this important time.’’ That 
is how a former Democratic Senator 
sees it. 
The Senate is supposed to be the 
Chamber where overheated partisan 
passions give way to sober judgment. 
Can we not at least wait until we know 
the facts? Can we not maintain a 
shred—just a shred—of national unity 
for 5 minutes—for 5 minutes—before 
deepening the partisan trenches? 
Must Democrats’ distaste for this 
President dominate every thought they 
express and every decision they make? 
Is that really the seriousness that this 
situation deserves? 
The full Senate will be briefed on 
Wednesday. I expect the committees of 
oversight will also conduct hearings 
and that the Senators will have plenty 
of opportunities to discuss our inter-
ests and policies in the region. 
I urge my colleagues to bring a full 
awareness of the facts, mindfulness of 
the long history of Iran’s aggression 
toward the United States and its allies, 
and a sober understanding of the threat 
Iran continues to pose. 
Could we at least remember we are 
all Americans first, and we are all in 
this together? 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
the meantime, at this dangerous time, 
House Democrats continue to play po-
litical games with their partisan im-
peachment of the Commander in Chief. 
Last year, House Democrats conducted 
the least thorough, most rushed, most 
unfair impeachment inquiry in history. 
For weeks, Democrats said they could 
not wait for due process, could not con-
duct a normal or fair inquiry because 
removing the President from office was 
so incredibly urgent—incredibly ur-
gent. 
Well, the unseriousness was obvious 
then and should be even more obvious 
now because Speaker PELOSI is now sit-
ting on the articles she claimed were so 
very urgent. She has delayed this in-
definitely so the architects of the 
failed House process can look for ways 
to reach over here into the Senate and 
dictate our process as well. 
Democrats have tried to insist that 
the Senate deviate from the unanimous 
bipartisan precedent set in the 1999 
trial of President Clinton and write 
new rules for President Trump. They 
have tried to precommit the Senate to 
redoing House Democrats’ slapdash 
work for them and pursuing avenues 
Chairman SCHIFF himself didn’t bother 
to pursue. 
The Senate has a unanimous bipar-
tisan precedent for when to handle 
midtrial questions such as witnesses: 
in the middle of the trial. That is when 
that was done the last time, and that is 
the way it should be done this time. 
In 1999, every single U.S. Senator 
agreed to establish basic parameters 
for the start of the trial upfront and re-
serve midtrial questions, such as wit-
nesses, until later. The vote was 100 to 
0. That was good enough for President 
Clinton, so it ought to be good enough 
for President Trump. Fair is fair. 
House Democrats’ hunger to break 
our Senate precedents, just like they 
broke their own House precedents, 
could not be more telling, but the Sen-
ate does not just bob along on the cur-
rents of every news cycle. The House 
may have been content to scrap their 
own norms to hurt President Trump, 
but that is not the Senate. Even with a 
process this constitutionally serious, 
even with tensions rising in the Middle 
East, House Democrats are treating 
impeachment like a political toy—like 
a political toy—treating their own ef-
fort to remove our Commander in Chief 
like some frivolous game. 
These bizarre stunts do not serve our 
Constitution or our national security. 
They erode both. My Democratic col-
leagues should not plow away Amer-
ican unity in some bizarre intramural 
competition to see who dislikes the 
President more. 
They should not disdain our Con-
stitution by rushing through a purely 
partisan 
impeachment 
process 
and 
then toying around with it. Governing 
is serious business. The American peo-
ple deserve better, a lot better than 
this.

RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
IRAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has 
been 4 days since the United States 
carried out a military operation that 
killed Major General Qasem Soleimani, 
the commander of the Islamic Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps Quds Force. In the 
days since, I have become increasingly 
alarmed about the strike, a strike that 
was carried out with insufficient trans-
parency, without consultation of Con-
gress, and without a clear plan for 
what comes next. 
President Trump had promised to 
keep the United States out of endless 
wars in the Middle East. The Presi-
dent’s actions, however, have seem-
ingly increased the risk that we could 
be dragged into exactly such a war. It 
is indicative of President Trump’s for-
eign policy record, which is riddled by 
chaotic, uninformed, erratic, and im-
pulsive decision-making without ade-
quate 
consideration 
for 
the 
con-
sequences. 
In just about every foreign policy 
area President Trump touches, we are 
worse off than we were before he start-
ed with it. Whether it is with China, 
North Korea, Syria, Russia, the Presi-
dent has careened from one impulsive 
action to the next, with no coherent 
strategy. North Korea today—despite 
what President Trump said, we don’t 
have to worry about them—is a greater 
nuclear threat than they have ever 
been. Trump’s actions have been disas-
trous. North Korea has more nuclear 
weapons, and, by all reports, has either 
developed or is very close to developing 
an ICBM that can hit the U.S. main-
land. That is a result of President 
Trump’s bumbling. 
The situation in Syria is much worse 
than before. Doing what he did in 
Syria, pulling out those troops, made 
no sense to anybody, even the most 
hawkish foreign policy people we have, 
and every time the President seems to 
deal with Putin, Putin seems to come 
out ahead. Looking at the President’s 
chaotic and rudderless foreign policy in 
hotspots around the globe, it is hard to 
conclude that any of the situations are 
better off than when the President 
took office 3 years ago. His policies 
seem to be characterized by erratic, 
impulsive, and often egotistical behav-
ior, with little regard to a long-term 
strategy that would advance the inter-
ests of the United States. 
At times like this, it is essential for 
Congress to provide a check on the 
President and assert our constitutional 
role in matters of war and peace. In my 
view, President Trump does not—does 
not—have authority to go to war with 
Iran. There are several important 
pieces of legislation that seek to, 
again, assert Congress’s authority and 
prerogative on these matters. 
Senator KAINE has a War Powers Res-
olution that would force a debate and 
vote in Congress to seek to prevent fur-
ther escalation of hostilities with Iran. 
That resolution will be privileged, so it 
will have to come to the floor. My col-
leagues, we are going to vote on it. 
Senator SANDERS has introduced a 
bill that would block funding for the 
war with Iran. I am supportive of both 
Senator KAINE’s and Senator SANDERS’ 
efforts, and I urge the Senate to con-
sider both in the coming days. 
Additionally, the Trump administra-
tion must start acting with greater 
transparency. By law, the Trump ad-
ministration must make a notification

January 6, 2020 
to Congress when it conducts a mili-
tary operation like the one last Friday. 
That is known as a War Powers Act no-
tification. Unusually, the Trump ad-
ministration made the notification on 
Saturday, after the action occurred, 
and then they did it in a completely 
classified format. 
Let me be clear. An entirely classi-
fied notification—in the case of this 
particular military operation—is sim-
ply not appropriate, and there appears 
to be no legitimate justification for 
classifying this notification. 
Ranking Member MENENDEZ
and I 
sent a letter to the President urging 
declassification. It is critical that na-
tional security matters of such impor-
tance—war and peace and the possi-
bility of another ‘‘endless war’’ in the 
Middle East—that knowledge of the ac-
tions and justification should be shared 
with the American people in a timely 
manner. It is Americans who will be 
asked to pay for such a war if it occurs. 
It is American soldiers who will brave-
ly risk their lives once again. 
The reason the Founding Fathers 
gave Congress war-making authority is 
very simple: They were afraid of an 
overreaching Executive. They wanted 
to make sure that any act as impor-
tant as war—war and peace—be dis-
cussed in an open manner by the Con-
gress so it could be vetted, so questions 
could be asked, so a small, insular 
group—and 
the 
President’s 
group 
seems even more and more insular be-
cause anyone of strength and courage, 
people like Mattis and McMaster, who 
disagrees with the President because 
he is so erratic leaves, leaving a bunch 
of ‘‘yes’’ people who seem to want to do 
whatever the President wants. That 
means having a debate in Congress 
where questions are asked and coming 
to the American people so that people 
can hear a justification and see if it is 
actually a valid one is vital. 
The administration still has to an-
swer several very crucial questions 
about their actions last week. Iran has 
many dangerous surrogates in the re-
gion and a whole range of possible re-
sponses. Which responses do we expect? 
Which are the most likely? What do we 
know about what Iran would plan to do 
in retaliation, and what are our plans 
to counter all of these responses? How 
effective does our military, does our 
CIA, does our State Department think 
these responses will be? 
The next question is, What does this 
action mean for the long-term stability 
for Iraq? What does it mean for our 
presence in Iraq? What does it mean to 
the trillions of dollars—trillions—and 
thousands of American lives sacrificed 
there? How does what we are doing now 
fit into that? How does the administra-
tion plan to manage any escalation of 
the hostilities? How does the adminis-
tration plan to avoid a larger and po-
tentially endless conflagration in the 
Middle East? 
These are crucial questions. Not one 
has been answered by the President or 
anyone in the administration. All of 
the tweeting and all of the bravado is 
no substitute for strategic thinking 
and long-term foreign policy goals and 
ways to achieve those goals. This ad-
ministration seems to be devoid of 
that. It certainly was when it came to 
North Korea. It certainly was when it 
came to Syria. It certainly is when it 
comes to Russia, and it seems likely 
the same case is now occurring with 
Iran. 
At a minimum, the questions I men-
tioned must be answered. This is an 
important moment for our Nation. The 
American people need clarity that the 
Trump administration has a plan—not 
just a tweet but a plan—to keep our 
troops, our Nation, and our people safe. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. President, as my colleagues re-
turn from the holiday recess, one ques-
tion looms before us: Will the Senate 
conduct a fair impeachment trial of 
the President of the United States? 
Will we search for all of the facts, or 
will we look for a coverup—a sham 
trial—on one of the most important 
powers the Founding Fathers gave the 
American people? 
The Framers gave the Senate the 
sole power to try Presidential impeach-
ments because they could not imagine 
another 
body 
with 
‘‘confidence 
enough’’ in its own status to ‘‘preserve 
the necessary impartiality.’’ It is up to 
every Senator now to live up to that 
awesome and profound responsibility. 
At the moment, there is a very clear 
difference of opinion between the Re-
publican leader and myself about what 
it means to have a fair trial. I believe 
a fair trial is one that considers all the 
relevant facts and allows relevant wit-
nesses and documents—a feature of 
every single impeachment trial of a 
President in the history of our Nation. 
We have never had one with no wit-
nesses—not once. 
Leader MCCONNELL
likes to cite 
precedent. That precedent stares him 
in the face, and he can’t answer it. My 
Republican counterpart believes that a 
trial should feature no relevant wit-
nesses and none of the relevant docu-
ments. He has made clear in his public 
appearance on FOX News that it should 
proceed according to the desires of the 
White House—the defendant in this 
case. Glaringly, the Republican leader 
has yet to make one single argument 
why witnesses should not testify. 
I am waiting to hear it, Leader 
MCCONNELL. Give us specific answers 
why these witnesses should not come 
forward. Don’t call names. Don’t fin-
ger-point. Don’t get angry at NANCY 
PELOSI. Tell us why, here in the Sen-
ate, witnesses and documents should 
not come forward that are directly rel-
evant to the charges against the Presi-
dent of the United States of America. 
Leader MCCONNELL has sort of ex-
empted himself from fair debate. He 
doesn’t want a fair trial; he wants a 
quick and sham trial. Now it is up to 
every Senator. Every Senator will have 
a say in deciding which of the two 
views wins out. Will we have a fair 
trial or a coverup? Will we hear the 
evidence, or will we try to hide it? It 
will not be me and not the Republican 
leader alone but a majority of Senators 
who will decide whether we have a fair 
trial with facts and evidence or a Sen-
ate-sponsored coverup of the Presi-
dent’s alleged misconduct. 
Make no mistake—there will be votes 
on whether to call each of the four wit-
nesses we proposed and subpoena the 
documents we have identified. Under 
the rules of the Senate trial, the mi-
nority will be able to offer motions 
subject to a majority vote. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, your constituents and the 
voice of history are watching. You will 
be required to vote on whether we have 
a fair trial with witnesses and with 
documents, or you will say: I am run-
ning away from the facts. I am scared 
of the facts. I will go for a coverup. 
A few hours ago, the momentum for 
uncovering the truth in a Senate trial 
gathered even more momentum. One of 
the key witnesses I have asked for, Mr. 
John Bolton, former National Security 
Advisor to President Trump, correctly 
acknowledged that he needs to comply 
with a Senate subpoena for his testi-
mony, if issued. Previously, Mr. Bolton 
said he was leaving the question of his 
testimony up to the courts. Today, he 
made it perfectly clear that he will 
come if the Senate asks, as he should. 
The other potential witnesses we have 
identified—Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Duffey, 
and Mr. Blair—should do the same. 
We know that Mr. Bolton, like Mr. 
Mulvaney, Mr. Duffey, and Mr. Blair— 
the three other witnesses—has crucial, 
eyewitness knowledge of the Presi-
dent’s dealings with Ukraine, about 
how decisions were made to withhold 
security assistance and how opposition 
within the administration to that 
delay President Trump seemed to want 
was overcome. 
A simple majority is all it takes to 
ensure that the Senate issues a sub-
poena for these witnesses. If only four 
Republicans decide that Mr. Bolton and 
the three other witnesses ought to be 
heard, they will be heard, because 
every Democrat will vote to hear them. 
It is now up to four Senate Republicans 
to support bringing in Mr. Bolton and 
the three other witnesses, as well as 
the key documents we have requested, 
to ensure that all the evidence is pre-
sented at the outset of the Senate 
trial. 
Given that Mr. Bolton’s lawyers have 
stated he has new and relevant infor-
mation to share, if any Senate Repub-
lican opposes issuing subpoenas to the 
four witnesses and documents we have 
requested, they would make it abso-
lutely clear they are participating in a 
coverup on one of the most sacred du-
ties we have in this Congress—in this 
Senate—and that is to keep a President 
in check. 
Leader MCCONNELL has suggested we 
follow the 1999 example of beginning 
the impeachment trial first and then 
deciding on witnesses and documents

January 6, 2020 
after the arguments are complete. He 
keeps making this argument. It doesn’t 
gather any steam because it is such a 
foolish one. Let me again respond for 
the benefit of my colleagues. 
Witnesses and documents are the 
most important issue, and we should 
deal with them first. To hear Leader 
MCCONNELL say ‘‘no witnesses now but 
maybe some later’’ is just another indi-
cation that he has no argument against 
witnesses and documents on the mer-
its. He is afraid to address the argu-
ment because he knows it is a loser for 
him, so he says: Let’s decide it later. 
Why? There is no reason. In fact, it is 
sort of backward. We are going to have 
all the arguments—pro and con—then 
say maybe we will have witnesses and 
documents? We will have the argu-
ments first and the evidence later? As 
I have said, Leader MCCONNELL’s view 
of the trial is an ‘‘Alice in Wonder-
land’’ view—first the trial, then the 
evidence. 
More important than precedent is the 
fact that his analogy plainly doesn’t 
make sense because you don’t have 
both sides present their arguments 
first and then afterward ask for the 
evidence that we know is out there. 
The evidence should inform the trial, 
not the other way around. 
When Leader MCCONNELL
proposes 
that we follow the 1999 precedent, he is 
essentially arguing that we should con-
duct the entire impeachment trial first 
and then once it is over, decide on 
whether we need witnesses and docu-
ments. Again, MCCONNELL’s view is 
‘‘Alice in Wonderland,’’ where we first 
have the trial and then the evidence. If 
the Senate were to agree to Leader 
MCCONNELL’s 
proposal, 
the 
Senate 
would act as little more than a nation-
ally televised meeting of a mock trial 
club. 
Leader MCCONNELL’s proposal on wit-
nesses and documents later is a poorly 
disguised trap. He has already actually 
made clear what his goals are. He said 
it on FOX News radio: ‘‘After we’ve 
heard the arguments, we ought to vote 
and move on’’ with no witnesses and no 
documents. 
Well, at least 47 Democrats and I 
hope some Republicans won’t fall for 
that kind of specious logic. What 
MCCONNELL
said doesn’t sound like 
someone who will reasonably consider 
witnesses and documents at a later 
date; he sounds more like someone who 
has already made up his mind. 
You cannot have a fair trial without 
the facts and without the testimony 
from witnesses with knowledge of the 
events and related documents. A trial 
without all the facts is a farce. 
If the President is acquitted at the 
end of a partisan sham trial with no 
witnesses and no documents, then his 
acquittal will not carry much weight 
in the minds of the American people or 
in the judgment of history. 
President Trump, if you are hurting 
about this impeachment and you are 
wishing for a fair trial and a real ac-
quittal, join us in asking for the wit-
nesses to come forward. Join us in ask-
ing for the documents. What are you 
hiding, President Trump? What are you 
afraid of, President Trump? If you 
think that you have done nothing 
wrong, you wouldn’t mind having your 
own witnesses come here. These are 
people you appointed. 
Most Americans know that President 
Trump seems to be afraid of the truth. 
And 64 percent of all Republicans who 
almost always side with President 
Trump in the polling data say there 
should be witnesses and documents—64 
percent. A trial without all the facts is 
a farce. The verdicts of a kangaroo 
court are empty. 
It is time for a bipartisan majority in 
this Chamber, Democrat and Repub-
lican, to support the rules and proce-
dures of a fair trial. A vote to allow 
witnesses and documents does not pre-
sume a vote for conviction in any way. 
It merely ensures that when the ulti-
mate judgment is rendered, whatever 
that judgment will be, it will be based 
on the facts. We don’t know what the 
witnesses will say; it could be excul-
patory for President Trump or it could 
be more condemning. Whatever it will 
be, we should have the facts come out 
and let the chips fall where they may. 
The Senate Democrats believe we must 
conduct a fair trial. As for the Senate 
Republicans, we will see. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
have some prepared remarks regarding 
the Soleimani strike and some other 
related matters, but I want to take a 
moment and just respond briefly to my 
friend, the Democratic leader. 
There seems to be a lot of irony in-
volved in this question of the Articles 
of Impeachment. First of all, of course, 
Speaker PELOSI, who said this is an ur-
gent fulfilling of a constitutional duty 
and who wanted the Articles of Im-
peachment voted on in the House, has 
been radio silent and appears to be get-
ting cold feet on whether or not she 
will even send the Articles of Impeach-
ment to the Senate. 
I would suggest that the first thing 
we need to know is if Speaker PELOSI is 
actually serious about this. If she is 
not, there is no occasion for us to even 
begin this conversation about how the 
Senate trial will proceed. Speaker 
PELOSI is mistaken if she thinks she 
can direct or influence the Senate’s de-
cision on how the trial will proceed. In 
fact, one of the things I am pretty sure 
of is that the Senate will not replicate 
the circuslike atmosphere of the im-
peachment inquiry in the House, which 
was one of the most partisan under-
takings I have seen in my time in the 
Senate. 
I think they are really grasping at 
straws now and are recognizing they 
did a poor job in developing the case 
that led to the two Articles of Im-
peachment. One was because of a dis-
agreement over the manner in which 
the President exercised his authority 
under the Constitution to engage in 
foreign relations, and the other was 
based on this bogus idea that by say-
ing: I need to go to court to get some 
direction on a claim of executive privi-
lege, that somehow, even though Mr. 
SCHIFF
dropped the subpoena or no 
longer sought that witness’s testi-
mony, one has obstructed Congress’s 
investigation. All of this was without 
even alleging any crime. 
I suggest that the Senate is an insti-
tution that follows the rules and that 
we follow our precedents. The most ob-
vious precedent for this impeachment 
trial is the Clinton impeachment trial. 
There, we saw 100 Senators agree to a 
procedure which allowed both sides to 
present their cases, after which there 
was a vote to see whether additional 
testimony would be required. Indeed, 
there was an agreement to provide 
three additional witnesses, not live, in 
a circuslike atmosphere here on the 
floor of the Senate, but through deposi-
tions taken out of court that could 
then be out of the Chamber, whereby 
excerpts of those depositions could be 
offered as additional evidence. That 
was the procedure that was supported 
by the Democratic leader, the Senator 
from New York. I suggest that what 
was fair for President Clinton is fair 
for President Trump. It is not much 
more complicated than that, and that, 
indeed, is the most relevant precedent. 
With regard to this claim that some 
Senators aren’t demonstrating impar-
tiality, I recall reading that the Sen-
ator from New York, when he was run-
ning 
against 
incumbent 
Senator 
D’Amato, said a vote for him for the 
Senate would be a guaranteed vote of 
acquittal of President Clinton. That 
was hardly impartial. Now he protests 
too much and, I think, demonstrates 
his hypocrisy when it comes to the 
standard by which he holds himself and 
others. 
I am sorry. I just can’t believe that 
Senator WARREN and Senator SANDERS 
would qualify under anybody’s defini-
tion of an impartial juror. Yet that is 
our constitutional system. I think 
what has happened is that they realize 
their case is falling short of any stand-
ard by which a President would be con-
victed and impeached, and they are 
simply grasping at straws. 
IRAN 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, last Friday, Americans woke up to 
the news that one of the most brutal 
terrorist leaders in the world had been 
killed. Qasem Soleimani was killed in 
an airstrike by America’s military, fi-
nally bringing an end to his decades- 
long reign of terror. 
You could legitimately call General 
Soleimani a master of disaster because 
that defined his entire professional life 
as the leader of Iran’s military. Actu-
ally, he was the head of the Islamic 
Revolutionary 
Guard 
Corps 
Quds 
Force, which is a U.S.-designated ter-
rorist organization. General Soleimani 
was the most consequential military 
leader in Iran, which has been des-
ignated by the U.S. State Department

January 6, 2020 
as a state sponsor of international ter-
rorism since 1984. General Soleimani 
orchestrated Iran’s efforts to squash 
democracy movements both at home 
and abroad by any means necessary. He 
and his army of terrorists exported vio-
lence around the region and engaged in 
gross human rights violations against 
the Iranian people. 
If you are curious how the Iranian 
Government treats its own citizens, 
just look at the recent protests that 
started as complaints over increased 
gas prices. When the Iranian citizens 
took to the streets in peaceful protest, 
the Ayatollah, the Supreme Leader, 
called them enemy agents and thugs, 
and the government attacked. As many 
as 450 Iranians were killed in those 
peaceful protests, with some 2,000 in-
jured and 7,000 detained. This is not a 
government that is protecting its peo-
ple; it is a network of criminals that 
masquerades as a government. One of 
the Ayatollah’s most loyal henchmen 
was Soleimani. 
In addition to leading attacks on the 
Iranian people and fueling terrorist op-
erations throughout the Middle East, 
he also played a crucial role in foment-
ing Syria’s civil war. Soleimani helped 
to finance and aid the butcher, known 
as Bashar al-Assad, in the slaughter of 
the Syrian people. The death toll of the 
Syrian civil war is estimated to be as 
high as a half a million Syrians, and 
the number of refugees and internally 
displaced persons goes into the mil-
lions. 
While the greatest death and destruc-
tion orchestrated by Soleimani was 
concentrated in the Middle East, the 
United States was one of his and Iran’s 
biggest targets. From the Iranian hos-
tage crisis back in 1979, to the Khobar 
Towers bombing, to the recent shoot-
ing down of a U.S. drone, to the death 
of an American contractor in Iraq, 
Iran’s actions at every turn have dem-
onstrated a desire to make the chant 
‘‘Death to America’’ a reality. 
Soleimani was known to be respon-
sible for the deaths of hundreds of 
American soldiers. He and the Iranian 
regime supplied explosively formed 
penetrators that cut through American 
armor like a hot knife through butter 
and left hundreds of American sol-
diers—indeed, maybe 1,000 or more— 
disabled as a result of this deadly in-
strument of war. Since 2003, at least 600 
U.S. soldiers have been killed by Ira-
nian proxies in Iraq, and as I have said, 
many more have been injured. 
I and others in this Chamber have 
seen 
their 
activities 
firsthand 
at 
Brooke Army Medical Center, the Cen-
ter for the Intrepid in San Antonio, 
and at other places where they have re-
ceived treatment, like at Walter Reed 
Army Medical Center here in Wash-
ington, DC. It is where the victims of 
these Iranian improvised explosive de-
vices were treated for amputation, for 
burns, or functional limb loss if they 
survived those injuries in the first 
place. These soldiers are a reminder of 
the selfless commitment our men and 
women in uniform make each day as 
well as the perilous threat posed by 
Iran under Soleimani’s leadership. 
For decades, since the Iranian Revo-
lution in 1979, Tehran has waged war 
against the United States and our al-
lies, and recent reports indicate that 
Soleimani was in the process of plot-
ting even more acts of aggression 
against the United States and U.S. in-
terests, which is hardly surprising, 
though, since he had been doing that 
for many years. That is precisely why 
he was targeted. 
Just as quickly as the news of this 
attack spread, so did anti-Trump rhet-
oric. Instead of celebrating the fact 
that Iran’s chief terrorist was dead and 
could kill no more, a number of our 
Democratic colleagues chose to bash 
the President instead. They claimed 
his action was unauthorized, even ille-
gal, or that he should have sought con-
gressional approval beforehand. None 
of that is true. The President not only 
has the authority under the Constitu-
tion but the responsibility to defend 
the United States from terrorist orga-
nizations like the Iranian Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps and its leaders 
like General Soleimani. 
This was neither an assassination—a 
particularly loathsome allegation that 
has been made on social media—nor an 
unprovoked attack. This was the Presi-
dent of the United States exercising his 
lawful authority to protect the United 
States, our allies, and our national in-
terests just as Presidents before have 
done. Perhaps the most stark compari-
son is when Barack Obama directed the 
killing of Osama bin Laden. Where 
were the people who now claim that 
Soleimani’s death is an abuse of power? 
I don’t recall anyone calling the killing 
of Osama bin Laden an assassination. 
When he was killed, they were not on 
cable TV, criticizing the move; we were 
all celebrating. 
Some of our Democratic friends will 
simply never pass on an opportunity to 
criticize the President—no matter how 
unfair. 
Thank 
goodness 
there 
are 
Democrats like former Department of 
Homeland 
Security 
Secretary 
Jeh 
Johnson and former U.S. Senator Joe 
Lieberman. 
Senator Joe Lieberman said: 
President Trump’s order to take out 
Qasem Soleimani was morally, constitu-
tionally and strategically correct. It de-
serves more bipartisan support than the be-
grudging or negative reactions it has re-
ceived thus far from my fellow Democrats. 
I am also grateful for the informed 
comments by luminaries like former 
CENTCOM Commander and former CIA 
Director General Petraeus as well as 
Ambassador Ryan Crocker, who have 
both rightly said that this action was 
authorized and necessary. 
It is unquestionable that the death of 
Soleimani was a major blow to the Ira-
nian regime and a strong message of 
deterrence to all state sponsors of ter-
rorism. The blood of hundreds of Amer-
ican soldiers and countless civilians is 
on Soleimani’s hands, and because of 
the decisive action taken by President 
Trump, he is gone. 
I fully support this move by the 
President, and I commend the Presi-
dent’s willingness to send a strong 
message of deterrence to the terrorist 
threat in the Middle East, particularly 
against the United States, our citizens, 
and our interests. 
Finally, I join my fellow Senators in 
thanking the brave men and women in 
uniform who fought and continue to 
fight terrorist acts brought about by 
people like General Soleimani and the 
Quds Force as part of the IRGC. I espe-
cially thank those who are fighting and 
who are prepared to defend our inter-
ests in the Middle East today. 
America must never back down in 
the face of this evil. Our world is safer 
today because Qasem Soleimani is 
dead. It would not have been possible 
without the actions that President 
Trump has undertaken or without the 
resolve of our military leaders and our 
courageous servicemembers who put 
their lives on the line each day. 
116TH CONGRESS 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, briefly, we have now crossed the 
halfway point of the 116th Congress, 
and it is safe to say that 2019 was an 
unconventional and a somewhat bumpy 
year. 
After 2 years with Republicans con-
trolling both Chambers of Congress and 
the White House, we were all prepared 
for the challenges that would come 
with 
a 
Democratically 
controlled 
House. Despite the unnecessary foot- 
dragging and political gaming and ob-
session with foiling the President, we 
were still able to accomplish a lot of 
good for the country and the people of 
my State of Texas. 
Last month alone, we made major 
moves to strengthen our military and 
support our troops. We passed a fund-
ing bill that increased the funding by 
nearly $20 billion—necessary to restore 
our readiness—and gave our troops the 
largest pay raise they had received in a 
decade. 
This complemented the National De-
fense Authorization Act, which author-
ized $400 million for military construc-
tion projects in Texas and 90 new F–35 
Joint Strike Fighters that will be built 
in Fort Worth. 
It also included a number of provi-
sions that I introduced to support our 
servicemembers and veterans. In 2016, 
only 46 percent of Active-Duty military 
voted by absentee ballot, and one-third 
of those who didn’t vote said that the 
absentee voting process was simply too 
complicated. 
To make that better, I introduced 
the Military Voter Protection Act, 
which became law last month. It 
makes the absentee voter registration 
process easier for servicemembers sta-
tioned overseas so that a complicated 
trail of paperwork doesn’t prevent 
them from casting their well-deserved 
ballots. 
I have also heard from my Texas con-
stituents who are veterans, who have

fallen on hard times and had to fight 
for their VA and Department of De-
fense disability benefits in bankruptcy 
proceedings. That should never be the 
case. Another bill I introduced called 
the HAVEN Act, which is now law, 
shields those benefits in the same way 
that Social Security disability is ex-
empted. No veteran should be penalized 
for receiving the disability compensa-
tion that they are rightly due. 
Of course, perhaps the biggest head-
line news is our continued work on ju-
dicial nominations. Under this admin-
istration, we have confirmed more than 
180 Federal judges, including 20 in 
Texas, plus 2 Supreme Court Justices. 
Although we are still 1 year shy of the 
end of President Trump’s first term, we 
have already confirmed more circuit 
court judges than in any other Presi-
dent’s first term in the past four dec-
ades. Having these impressive judges 
on the Federal bench will be a tremen-
dous benefit to the entire country for 
generations to come, and we will keep 
working to confirm even more. 
Over the last year, we have also built 
on our work to support victims of Hur-
ricane Harvey, including the release of 
$4.6 billion in additional funding from a 
bill to support communities across the 
country, including those in Texas, re-
covering from natural disasters. 
More than 2 years after the storm, 
many Texans are still rebuilding and, 
sadly, have had the added struggle of 
fighting to get their hands on Federal 
funds already approved by Congress. In 
February 2018, Congress passed a fund-
ing package that included more than $4 
billion 
in 
disaster 
mitigation 
for 
Texas, but more than a year later, 
folks at home still hadn’t seen a dime 
of that money. 
This summer, I introduced a bill that 
would require the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget to send those and any 
future funds approved by Congress 
within 90 days of their appropriation 
by Congress. Government bureaucrats 
should not be allowed to stand in the 
way between communities in need and 
funds already approved by Congress, 
and I am happy that those funds are fi-
nally going out the door to these Texas 
communities. 
Another challenge we have faced over 
the last year is the ongoing crisis at 
the border, which hit its peak in May. 
Local communities in Texas helped 
carry the weight of this humanitarian 
crisis, which has placed serious strain 
on their ability to deliver basic serv-
ices at the municipal and State levels. 
They diverted taxpayer dollars from 
things like public safety, power, and 
clean drinking water to do a job that 
should have been done by the Federal 
Government in the first place to secure 
our border. 
To right this wrong, we passed a 
funding agreement, at my request, 
which provided $30 million in reim-
bursements 
for 
local 
governments, 
States, and charitable organizations 
that have spent millions of dollars in 
response to this crisis, which seems to 
be ignored too often here in Wash-
ington, DC. Nearly 40 percent of this 
initial funding went to Texas to meet 
immediate needs, and I expect another 
round to come soon to cover additional 
expenses. 
Another big victory came in the form 
of international trade. Through my 
role as chairman of the Senate Finance 
Trade Subcommittee, I worked with 
the administration on three trade 
agreements with Japan, the USMCA— 
the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement— 
and China, all of which, I think, will 
inure to the benefit of all Americans, 
including Texans. I commend President 
Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer for 
their courage in confronting unfair 
trade practices, opening new markets, 
and providing economic certainty as 
we move into this election year. 
On top of all of this, we passed the bi-
partisan Taxpayer First Act, which in-
cludes some of the most significant re-
forms to the Internal Revenue Service 
in two decades. We stood with victims 
of domestic violence and sexual assault 
by finally passing the Debbie Smith 
Reauthorization Act, which strength-
ens our fight to end the rape kit back-
log. We helped provide additional re-
sources to secure America’s elections 
against foreign interference, and the 
list goes on and on and on. 
It is safe to say, though, that there 
are a number of items that could have 
been added to this list of accomplish-
ments, had they not been pulled into 
the political fray and this obsessive im-
peachment mania by the House of Rep-
resentatives. Two things we could have 
done that were not accomplished as a 
result of this obsession were bills to re-
duce prescription drug pricing and to 
reauthorize 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act, for which the Presiding 
Officer has played such an important 
leadership role. 
In both cases, there is broad bipar-
tisan support for action, and in both 
cases, our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle decided that political point 
scoring was more important than actu-
ally getting the job done; thus, we 
found ourselves at an impasse. As we 
gear up for a new year, those will be 
two of the top items on my priority 
list, and I hope our Democratic col-
leagues will work with us this time 
around to get them done. 
We are kicking off 2020 with a big, 
looming question mark hanging over 
this Chamber in the form of this im-
peachment trial, which was an urgent 
constitutional 
imperative 
until 
it 
wasn’t. We are anxious to see what 
Speaker PELOSI will finally decide, and 
we are waiting for the House to trans-
mit the Articles of Impeachment, but 
we are not going to let the grass grow 
under our feet in the interim. We are 
going to keep working to notch more 
wins for the American people, confirm 
more Federal judges, and pass the 
USMCA trade agreement, hopefully, 
before further delay.

Mr. HAWLEY. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
IRAN 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I am 
glad to be joined today by my col-
league from Illinois, who is a personal 
mentor of mine. We are here to talk 
about the threat of war with Iran and 
about the Constitution. 
I have been worried about this threat 
for some time, ever since President 
Trump chose to ignore the advice of his 
key national security professionals and 
allies by abandoning America’s com-
mitment to a diplomatic deal to limit 
Iran’s nuclear program. The Presi-
dent’s action since that tragic decision 
and the easily predictable responses of 
Iran to his actions have resulted in an 
escalating set of hostilities between 
the United States and Iran and its 
proxies. 
I will state at the outset my conclu-
sion. I believe that the United States 
should not be at war in Iran and that, 
indeed, another war in the Middle East 
now would be catastrophic. 
But I recognize that some of my col-
leagues may have a different point of 
view. So I speak in the hopes of forging 
a consensus on at least one issue, and 
that issue is this: If there is to be a war 
with Iran, it should not be initiated by 
this President or any President acting 
on his or her own. It should only be ini-
tiated by a vote of Congress following 
an open and public debate in full view 
of the American people. 
Every Member of Congress should 
vote and then be accountable for the 
question of whether another war in the 
Middle East is a good idea. The demand 
for congressional accountability is con-
stitutionally required in the unique 
constitutional 
framework 
that 
we 
have. We pledge to support and defend 
the principle that it is up to Congress 
to declare war, not the President. 
If we engage in a war, the odds are 
high that young American men and 
women will be killed or injured. Some 
will see their friends killed and in-
jured. Some will have the remainder of 
their lives affected by physical and 
emotional 
injuries, 
post-traumatic 
stress, the pain of losing friends, and 
their families and friends will bear 
those scars as well. If we are to order 
our troops and their families to run 
that risk, then, it should be based on a 
public consensus as reflected in an 
open congressional debate and vote 
that war is in the national interest. 
If Congress debates the matter in full 
view of the public and reaches the con-
clusion that war is necessary, so be it. 
Even if I were to vote no, if the major-
ity of my colleagues voted yes, I would 
agree that the decision to go to war 
was a legitimate basis to order our best 
and brightest into harm’s way. 
But by what right do we consign our 
troops to possible injury and death if

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S18 
January 6, 2020 
we are unwilling to have a debate and 
cast a vote ourselves? We cannot hide 
under our desks, outsource our con-
stitutional duty to any President, and 
pretend that we can avoid account-
ability for war and its consequences. 
Over the course of this week, I will 
address three topics about the issue of 
war with Iran. The first subject which 
I will address today is this: How did we 
get here? How did we come to the place 
where the United States and Iran are 
trading violent attacks against one an-
other and what does that mean for our 
country, the region, and the world? 
In the coming days, I will address 
two additional topics. I will discuss 
how Congress should reclaim its con-
stitutional war-making powers by act-
ing on a privileged resolution that Sen-
ator DURBIN and I have filed on Janu-
ary 3 to remove U.S. troops from hos-
tilities 
with 
Iran 
unless 
Congress 
passes a new declaration or legal au-
thorization initiating such a war. The 
resolution, which is also being offered 
on the House side by Representative 
SLOTKIN, will give all 535 Members of 
Congress the opportunity to declare 
where they are on the advisability of a 
war with Iran, and it also gives them 
an opportunity to affirm their commit-
ment to their oath of office. 
Finally, later in the week, I will ad-
dress the larger question of how the 
United States should deescalate ten-
sions in the Middle East so that we 
might better protect American lives 
and promote peace and stability in a 
very turbulent part of the world. 
How did we get here? 
The United States and Iran have a 
very troubled history. When Iran’s 
democratically elected Prime Minister, 
Mohammad Mossaddegh, supported ef-
forts to nationalize private energy re-
sources, the United States and Britain 
orchestrated a coup that led to his 
ouster in 1953. 
The overthrow of Iran’s democratic 
government, partially with U.S. sup-
port, led to the strengthened rule of 
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who 
ruled Iran as an Emperor until he was 
overthrown in the Iranian revolution of 
1979. His dictatorial rule, with strong 
support from the United States, in-
creasingly alienated the Iranian popu-
lation. When he fled the country during 
the revolution, Iran abolished the mon-
archy and declared itself an Islamic re-
public. 
Within a few months after the revo-
lution, Iranian protestors took over 
the American Embassy in Iran. For 
those of us who saw the protests out-
side the American Embassy in Baghdad 
last week, the images of the Iranian 
Embassy hostage taking in Iran in 1979 
were at the front of our minds. The 
protesters cited America’s role in the 
1953 coups, and they asked the United 
States to return the Shah, who had 
come to the United States seeking 
medical attention, to Iran for trial. 
The United States refused. Iran held 52 
Americans hostage for more than 440 
days until they were finally released in 
the first days of the Reagan adminis-
tration. 
After this attack—this inexcusable 
attack on the American Embassy—U.S. 
and Iran diplomatic relations were sev-
ered. The United States has imposed 
significant economic sanctions against 
Iran for decades. The United States 
provided support for Iraq in its 8-year 
war against Iran—a war in which hun-
dreds of thousands of Iranians were 
killed. 
In 1988, the U.S. Navy cruiser USS 
Vincennes shot down an Iranian com-
mercial airliner, killing 290 passengers 
and its crew. 
Iran 
has 
engaged 
in 
hostilities 
against the United States and our al-
lies in many settings—through tar-
geted 
attacks 
and 
assassinations 
around the world, covert and overt sup-
port for terrorist organizations, and de-
velopment of weapons systems in viola-
tion of U.N. security resolutions. Iran 
has been directly responsible for the 
deaths of thousands of Americans and 
indirectly responsible for many, many 
more. These activities over many dec-
ades have led America for years to view 
Iran as a key promoter of terrorism 
and one of the most concerning nation- 
state adversaries of the United States. 
In recent years, a particular focus 
has been Iran’s nuclear program. De-
spite Iran’s claim that it sought nu-
clear power purely for peaceful pur-
poses, legitimate suspicion of its intent 
led to a global campaign led by the 
United States to sanction Iran even 
more as a means of getting the country 
to abandon its quest for nuclear weap-
ons. 
After years of negotiations between 
six 
nations—France, 
Britain, 
the 
United 
States, 
Germany, 
Russia, 
China—and Iran, an agreement was 
reached in 2015 whereby Iran would 
pledge never to seek, acquire, or de-
velop nuclear weapons in exchange for 
gradual relaxation of sanctions against 
Iran. The agreement, known as the 
JCPOA, contained strict limits on 
Iran’s nuclear program that would 
gradually relax over 25 years. Iran’s 
pledge to never acquire or develop nu-
clear weapons was permanent, as was 
its commitment to abide by the inspec-
tion protocols of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency to ensure com-
pliance with that fundamental pledge. 
The JCPOA was not perfect, but it 
carefully preserved the ability of the 
United States and other nations to 
continue sanctions against Iran for its 
other activities and offered an oppor-
tunity for the first time in four decades 
for the United States and Iran to com-
municate through an established diplo-
matic process. 
As the Trump administration took 
office, the President pledged to undo 
this diplomatic deal, the JCPOA. The 
nations that agreed to the deal pointed 
out that Iran was complying with the 
deal, as did the IAEA, and the key offi-
cials of President Trump’s national se-
curity 
team—Defense 
Secretary 
Mattis, Secretary of State Tillerson, 
National Security Advisor McMaster, 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
General Dunford—all argued that the 
agreement was working and should be 
maintained. 
But President Trump made the deci-
sion that the United States should 
abandon the diplomatic deal. The U.S. 
abandonment of a working diplomatic 
deal was historic. No U.S. President 
had ever walked away from a diplo-
matic commitment of this kind. 
Many of us, at the time, warned the 
President that abandoning diplomacy, 
against the advice of allies and our na-
tional security professionals, would 
likely lead us to an unnecessary war. It 
was just a matter of time. Indeed, since 
the beginning of the Trump adminis-
tration, there have been increasing 
back-and-forth provocations that have 
now led us to a state of active hos-
tilities between the United States and 
Iran. 
Unclassified examples of U.S. activ-
ity under the Trump administration 
that have escalated hostilities with 
Iran include the following: 
On December 12, 2017, the United 
States and Israel reached a joint stra-
tegic work plan to counter Iranian ac-
tivity in the Middle East that included 
preparation for military escalation sce-
narios against Iran. 
On May 8, 2018, President Trump uni-
laterally withdrew from the JCPOA 
after promising to do so for months. 
On May 21, 2018, Secretary of State 
Pompeo, who had earlier expressed a 
preference for bombing Iran rather 
than entering into the JCPOA, vowed 
to ‘‘crush’’ Iranian operatives and 
proxies. 
On July 23, 2018, President Trump 
tweeted a threat to President Rouhani, 
warning that Iran would ‘‘SUFFER 
CONSEQUENCES 
THE 
LIKES 
OF 
WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY 
HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.’’ 
On August 6, 2018, the Trump admin-
istration 
unilaterally 
imposed 
eco-
nomic sanctions lifted as part of the 
JCPOA, despite Iran’s continued com-
pliance with the deal. 
In September of 2018, it was reported 
that new National Security Advisor 
John Bolton had asked the Department 
of Defense to prepare war plans against 
Iran. Later the same month, Bolton 
warned Iran that there would be ‘‘hell 
to pay’’ if the nation ever crossed the 
United States. 
On October 3, 2018, the Trump admin-
istration terminated the 1955 Treaty of 
Amity affirming friendly relations be-
tween the United States and Iran. The 
United States terminated it. The trea-
ty itself had long ago been made irrele-
vant by the actual hostilities between 
the nations, but the action of the 
United States in finding the treaty and 
publicly terminating it unilaterally 
was seen as a part of a pattern of hos-
tile intent. 
As early as the fall of 2018, Depart-
ment of Defense officials began to ex-
press concern that the U.S. maximum 
security pressure campaign against

January 6, 2020 
Iran was raising the risk of Iranian re-
taliation against American troops in 
Iraq and Syria. In an October 26 article 
in the Wall Street Journal, DOD offi-
cials were quoted as expressing concern 
that Iran’s belief that the United 
States was helping Israel with air-
strikes 
would 
jeopardize 
American 
lives in the region. 
On 
November 
5, 
2018, 
President 
Trump imposed additional sanctions on 
Iranian oil, shipping, and banking sec-
tors. 
On February 3, 2019, President Trump 
stated on ‘‘Face the Nation’’ that 
troops being withdrawn from Syria 
would be moved to Iraq to serve as a 
check against Iran. 
On February 11, 2019, Advisor Bolton 
released a video addressed to the 40th 
anniversary of the Iranian revolution, 
stating that Iran’s leaders would not 
‘‘have many more anniversaries to 
enjoy.’’ 
On February 13, 2019, the Trump ad-
ministration convened a meeting in 
Poland that was publicly described by 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
Benjamin 
Netanyahu on his official website as 
designed to ‘‘advance the common in-
terest of war’’ against Iran. 
In March 2019, press accounts re-
vealed that the Department of Energy 
had approved seven transfers of nuclear 
technical information from U.S. com-
panies to Saudi Arabia without inform-
ing Congress. The transfers were made 
despite U.S. awareness that the Gov-
ernment of Saudi Arabia had publicly 
threatened to develop nuclear weapons 
to counter Iran. 
On April 8, 2019, the United States 
designated the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard as a foreign terrorist organiza-
tion, the first time that had ever been 
used to apply to a foreign govern-
mental entity. 
On May 5, 2019, Advisor Bolton an-
nounced deployment of the Lincoln 
Carrier Strike Group and a bomber 
task force to the U.S. Central Com-
mand for the expressed purpose of 
countering Iran. 
On May 8, 2019, the Trump adminis-
tration ordered new sanctions against 
Iran’s metal industry. 
On May 10, 2019, the New York Times 
reported on war plans developed by the 
administration that could deploy up to 
120,000 additional U.S. troops to the 
Middle East to counter Iran. On the 
same day, the administration deployed 
Patriot missiles to U.S. Central Com-
mand to counter Iran. 
On May 24, 2019, the Trump adminis-
tration bypassed Congress, declaring 
an emergency citing ‘‘Iranian malign 
activity’’ in order to sell weapons to 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 
In June of 2019, President Trump or-
dered 3,500 more troops of the U.S. 
military to the Middle East to check 
Iran. 
On June 20, 2019, the United States 
initiated a strike against Iranian posi-
tions that was aborted at the last 
minute by President Trump. 
On June 24, 2019, President Trump 
imposed additional sanctions against 
Iran. 
On September 15, 2019, after drone at-
tacks on two key oil installations in 
Saudi 
Arabia, 
President 
Trump 
tweeted that the United States was 
‘‘locked and loaded depending on verifi-
cation from the Kingdom as to who 
they believe was the cause of the at-
tack.’’ 
On November 19, 2019, President 
Trump notified Congress that ‘‘con-
sistent with the War Powers Resolu-
tion,’’ he was deploying additional U.S. 
weapons and troops to Saudi Arabia to 
counter Iran. 
On December 29, 2019, following a 
rocket attack from an Iranian-backed 
militia in Iraq that killed an American 
contractor and wounded several others, 
the 
U.S. 
military 
struck 
Iranian- 
backed militia groups in Iraq and 
Syria, killing dozens. 
On January 2, 2019, President Trump 
ordered a drone strike killing Qasem 
Soleimani, a key Iranian military com-
mander as well as a key Iraqi military 
leader. The December and January 
strikes in Iraq were carried out despite 
the objections of the Iraqi Government 
and without any prior notification to 
Congress. Two days after the Soleimani 
strike, the President notified Congress 
of the action, which had been in the 
newspaper, obviously, ‘‘consistent with 
the War Powers Resolution.’’ 
Now, during the same time, Iran has 
conducted escalatory activities as well. 
Their bellicose behavior includes con-
tinued arming and financial backing of 
Hezbollah, a designated foreign ter-
rorist organization which carried out 
the bombing of the marine barracks in 
Beirut as well as efforts to target 
Israeli citizens and troops; support for 
the Houthis, including the supplying of 
ballistic missiles, thus escalating the 
civil war in Yemen; direct participa-
tion of troops and commanders in sup-
port of Bashar al-Assad’s murderous 
campaign against the Syrian people; 
support for the Popular Mobilization 
Committee-affiliated Shia militias in 
Iraq, which pose a direct threat to U.S. 
personnel; unjust detention of U.S. 
citizens; cyber attacks on U.S. offi-
cials, agencies, and companies; the 
downing of a U.S. unmanned aerial ve-
hicle in June of 2019; UAV strikes 
against Saudi oil facilities in Sep-
tember 2019; persistent interference 
with commercial shipping in the Strait 
of Hormuz; militia attacks on the Iraqi 
base in December that killed an Amer-
ican contractor; and stoking popular 
unrest against the United States in 
Iraq that encouraged the assault on the 
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad last week. 
I have given you these examples for a 
reason. You can see the reason. There 
has been an escalation that began with 
the U.S. decision to destroy a diplo-
matic deal, and it has been one nation 
acting and the other responding, and 
the other acting and the other respond-
ing, and now we are on the brink of 
war. The escalation has been so signifi-
cant between the United States and 
Iran that now each country has been 
responsible for actively inflicting inju-
ries and deaths on the other, and we 
are at the brink of war. 
Thousands of American servicemem-
bers enjoying the holidays with their 
families were surprised by notices in 
the last few days that they must now 
deploy to the Middle East yet again. 
The current state of hostilities is caus-
ing other serious consequences. 
The U.S. abandonment of the diplo-
matic deal, together with other ac-
tions, has seriously jeopardized our re-
lations with many allies, particularly 
our European allies. The U.S. abandon-
ment of a diplomatic deal over a nu-
clear program has made it much harder 
to find a diplomatic deal with North 
Korea. The U.S. decision to carry out 
strikes on Iraqi soil over Iraqi objec-
tions has badly damaged U.S.-Iraq rela-
tions. Just yesterday, the Iraqi Par-
liament voted to ask all U.S. troops to 
leave Iraq. If that occurs, it will fur-
ther destabilize a country that has 
been wracked with protests in recent 
months, and it will embolden both ISIS 
and Iran. 
U.S. actions have had the unlikely ef-
fect of driving three of our principled 
nation-state adversaries into histori-
cally unprecedented levels of coopera-
tion. Just recently, Iran, China, and 
Russia conducted joint naval oper-
ations in the Gulf of Oman. 
Notably, the U.S. actions that I have 
described here have been carried out 
mostly by President Trump without 
congressional approval and often with-
out any notice or any consultation 
with Congress. Members of Congress on 
the relevant committees have had to 
read about these actions in the news-
papers rather than being informed by 
the Trump administration. 
At this particular moment, with the 
specter of war so present, it is time for 
Congress to assert itself. We cannot let 
a President destroy American diplo-
macy on its own. We cannot let a 
President take our Nation, take our 
troops, and take our best and brightest 
into an unnecessary war on his own. In-
deed, we cannot leave the lives of our 
troops up to the whim of this President 
or of any President. 
That is why Senator DURBIN and I 
have introduced, pursuant to the same 
War Powers Act referenced by the 
President, a resolution that will force 
the removal of U.S. troops from hos-
tilities with Iran unless Congress inde-
pendently votes that we should be at 
war. Congress has the responsibility, 
and Congress must act to shoulder its 
responsibility. 
I will offer more comments on the 
resolution later this week, but I appre-
ciate the support of my colleague, who, 
as I said, in many ways, is my mentor 
in the Senate, the Senator from Illi-
nois. 
I yield the floor to him. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi-
nority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
thank the Senator from Virginia for 
his clarion call for the U.S. Senate to 
assert its constitutional responsibility

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S20 
January 6, 2020 
when it comes to the prospect of a war 
with Iran. 
He has referenced, many times, the 
War Powers Act. The War Powers Act, 
students of history will remember, was 
passed by the U.S. Congress after the 
end of the Vietnam war so Congress 
would assert, with specificity, its au-
thority when it came to the execution 
of a war. The President at the time, 
Richard Nixon, opposed the War Pow-
ers Act and vetoed it, and because of 
what the United States had endured 
during the course of the Vietnam war, 
Congress overrode the veto of Presi-
dent Nixon to make it clear, with the 
War Powers Act, that we would never 
ever, by design, find ourselves in the 
same moral predicament we did with 
the war in Vietnam. 
Almost 50,000 American lives were 
lost in that war in Vietnam, a war 
which was not a declared war under the 
Constitution but one which still ex-
acted a heavy, incalculable price on 
American families—families I know 
and everyone knows, whose lives were 
touched by that Vietnam war, whose 
sons and daughters may have served or 
may have given their lives in service. 
The decision was made in Congress 
never again. We are not going to let 
this happen again. We are not going to 
find ourselves backsliding into a war. 
The American people, through their 
elected men and women representing 
them in Congress, will make the deci-
sion as to whether it is time for us to 
go to war and will make the decision as 
to whether our men and women in uni-
form are going to risk their lives at 
war. The decision will be made by the 
American people through their elected 
representatives in Congress. It was not 
a novel idea. We find it in this little 
Constitution, which we are all handed 
when we take the oath of office. 
As Senator KAINE from Virginia has 
noted, article I, section 8, in just a few 
words, says: The Congress shall have 
the power to declare war. It is not 
equivocal. There are no footnotes, as-
terisks, or question marks. The Con-
gress shall have the authority to de-
clare war. 
Now, at this moment in time, with 
the assassination of General Soleimani 
and the escalation of the conflict be-
tween the United States and Iran, Sen-
ator KAINE and I come to the floor and 
ask this Congress, Republicans and 
Democrats 
alike: 
Do 
these 
words 
count? Do we have a constitutional re-
sponsibility to stand up and speak up 
and to challenge this President or any 
President of either political party 
when they start moving us toward a 
moment of war which could easily 
claim the lives of many Americans? 
That is the purpose of our resolution. 
It is simple and straightforward, but it 
really goes to a fundamental question. 
The men and women who serve this 
country in uniform—God bless them 
for their sacrifice and their courage. 
We know that when they take the oath 
to serve, they are prepared to risk 
their lives in service. Many of us have 
attended the funerals of servicemem-
bers who gave their lives in Iraq and 
Afghanistan and so many other places. 
It is a heartbreaking experience to see 
that emotional family leaving a church 
or a synagogue after a service honoring 
someone in uniform who has given 
their life for this country. That is so 
fundamental. 
Senator KAINE and I have come to 
the floor today to say we are finding 
ourselves now moving, day by day, 
closer and closer to a confrontation 
with Iran that could result in a war. 
What Senator KAINE
has catalogued 
and gone through is this long buildup 
under the Trump administration that 
brings us to this moment. 
To think President Trump inherited 
from President Obama an international 
agreement that included the signato-
ries of not only our traditional Euro-
pean allies but also China and Russia 
to stop Iran from developing a nuclear 
weapon; to think that that agreement 
was being monitored by international 
overseers who reported back to us that 
they had ready access throughout the 
nation of Iran when it came to making 
certain that the JCPOA agreement was 
lived up to; to think that that at least 
gave us the assurance that Iran would 
not develop a nuclear weapon—and 
then this President, with a series of 
tweets and actions, swept it away and 
said we are going to ignore this treaty, 
we are going to walk away from it, and 
we are going to confront the Iranians 
in a variety of ways, as Senator KAINE 
has spelled out. 
So we come to the floor this after-
noon to really appeal to our colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle. On behalf of 
the American people, let us learn the 
lessons of history—a lesson bitterly 
learned during the Vietnam war—that 
if Congress does nothing, a war can de-
velop and continue at great human 
cost. 
I know the moments of great decision 
that are made in the U.S. Congress, 
and I have been fortunate to be part of 
some of them. I remember October 16, 
2002, as if it were yesterday. I remem-
ber that well, at that place that I point 
to, where in the early morning hours, 
three of us—three Senators stood and 
spoke to one another as we left to go 
home. There had just been a vote for an 
authorization for use of military force 
in Iraq. The three of us had gathered in 
the 
well, 
including 
Senator 
Paul 
Wellstone from Minnesota and Senator 
Kent Conrad from North Dakota, and 
we looked at one another, having all 
three voted against the invasion of 
Iraq, and realized we were headed home 
to face the electorate on that decision. 
It was an emotional moment. 
I 
remember 
saying 
to 
Senator 
Wellstone, who had voted against the 
invasion of Iraq, as I had: Paul, I hope 
this doesn’t cost you the election. He 
said: Dick, if it does, it is all right be-
cause that is what I was elected to do, 
to come here and to vote on issues. Is 
it possible there is any issue more im-
portant than the issue of asking Amer-
ican families to give their children in 
service of this country in a war? 
Senator Wellstone passed away a few 
days later in an airplane crash. It was 
my last conversation with him, but I 
remember that moment, and I remem-
ber the responsibility we had. What 
Senator KAINE and I are doing now is 
to appeal to our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle. Do not walk away 
from our responsibility when it comes 
to the future decision of whether we go 
to war with Iran. Stand up for those 
American families who sent us here to 
do our constitutional duty and engage 
in the debate as to whether it is the 
right thing at the right moment of his-
tory or whether it is an impulsive deci-
sion by a President who broke away 
from a political campaign meeting to 
authorize the assassination of General 
Soleimani and then returned to the 
campaign meeting. Make the decision 
as to whether this is the right moment 
in history. Don’t point to the President 
that it is his responsibility; it is our re-
sponsibility. That is what this Con-
stitution says. 
(Mr. BOOZMAN assumed the Chair.) 
Now, with that responsibility, we 
need to stand up and act. I am honored 
to join Senator KAINE. We have filed 
our resolution. We are seeking a ruling 
by the Parliamentarian, and we want 
to move forward on a schedule for a de-
bate on the floor of the Senate. It may 
be the single most important debate we 
face this year for many years to come. 
I yield the floor.

ADMINISTRATION OF OATH OF 
OFFICE 
The VICE PRESIDENT. If the Sen-
ator-designate will now present herself 
at the desk, the Chair will administer 
the oath of office. 
The Senator-elect, KELLY LOEFFLER, 
escorted by Ms. ERNST, advanced to the 
desk of the Vice President; the oath 
prescribed by law was administered to 
her by the Vice President; and she sev-
erally subscribed to the oath in the Of-
ficial Oath Book. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Congratula-
tions. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Maryland 
is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF JOVITA CARRANZA 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss the nomination of U.S. 
Treasurer Jovita Carranza to lead the 
Small Business Administration. Treas-
urer Carranza’s nomination comes at a 
time of great change for American 
small businesses. With the growing di-
versity in America, the face of business 
ownership in America is naturally also 
becoming more diverse. 
I have witnessed these changes first-
hand in my home State of Maryland, 
which currently boasts the highest 
concentration of women-owned busi-
nesses in the country, as well as the 
highest 
concentration 
of 
minority- 
owned businesses. Maryland’s success 
has been no accident; it is as a result of 
our leaders’ decades-long commitment 
to creating opportunities for under-
served 
entrepreneurs, 
which 
began 
when the late Baltimore Congressman 
Parren J. Mitchell created the first 
Federal set-aside for minority contrac-
tors in 1977. 
It was with this understanding that I 
requested a seat on the Small Business 
Committee when I joined this body in 
2006, and it is with this understanding 
that I am hopeful that Treasurer 
Carranza will provide much needed 
leadership at the SBA and serve as an 
advocate for entrepreneurs—especially 
those from underserved communities— 
within the administration. 
If confirmed to lead the SBA, Treas-
urer Carranza will enter an agency 
that has not had a Deputy Adminis-
trator since April 2018 and that has 
been led by its General Counsel since 
former Administrator Linda McMahon 
resigned in April 2019. She will join an 
administration that has pushed for 
drastic cuts at the SBA in every budget 
it has sent to Congress. I am grateful 
that our Appropriations Committee 
has consistently rejected the adminis-
tration’s devastating budget proposals, 
and I hope that Treasurer Carranza 
will work to ensure that the adminis-
tration’s fiscal year 2021 budget is not 
more of the same. 
Minorities, women, veterans, and en-
trepreneurs from other underserved 
communities face specific, historical 
barriers to business ownership, and 
they need an SBA that has the leader-
ship, vision, and tools required to meet 
their needs. I would like to use this op-
portunity to highlight what I believe 
are the two most critical areas where 
the SBA is falling short in its support 
of underserved communities. 
First, SBA must do a better job of 
providing affordable capital to entre-
preneurs from underserved commu-
nities. 
SBA’s various loan programs provide 
entrepreneurs with affordable capital 
to fund their businesses. These loans 
are especially important for under-
served entrepreneurs, who typically 
have less wealth with which to fund a 
small business and have lower rates of 
business loan approvals. 
Instead of filling in the gaps in the 
credit markets, SBA’s highest volume 
loan program, the 7(a) Program, has 
mirrored the inequities in the market. 
That is something we need to address. 
Addressing this issue is important not 
only in Maryland, which, as I men-
tioned, has one of the most diverse 
small business communities in the 
country, it is vital for the future 
health of America’s economy, consid-
ering that women and minorities are 
driving growth in new business forma-
tion. 
According to a recent American Ex-
press study, the overall business own-
ership rate increased only 9 percent be-
tween 2014 and 2019. Over the same 5- 
year period, the number of women- 
owned businesses increased 21 per-
cent—more than twice as fast as the 
overall rate—and the number of minor-
ity women-owned businesses grew by 43 
percent. 
It is clear that the underserved com-
munities are driving the growth and 
business formation in America, and 
SBA’s loan programs must catch up to 
this new reality. 
Second, SBA must do all it can to in-
crease opportunity for small business 
contractors. Recent trends paint an on-
erous picture of the future of small 
business contracting. A 2019 Bloomberg 
Government report found that despite 
a steady increase in government spend-
ing in the past several years, the Fed-
eral contracting marketplace is becom-
ing less competitive, with the number 
of contractors working on unclassified 
contracts at a 10-year low. Small busi-
nesses are facing the brunt of this de-
crease, which is particularly troubling 
in 
Maryland, 
where 
Federal 
con-
tracting accounted for 8 percent— 
roughly $33 billion—of our State’s GDP 
in 2018. The jobs created by these com-
panies have helped thousands of fami-
lies in Maryland enter the middle 
class. 
The Senate has taken steps to help 
small contractors. I am proud to share 
that today SBA will begin imple-
menting the Runway Extension Act— 
legislation I introduced that will allow 
small businesses to make critical in-
vestments to grow their businesses 
without fearing they will lose access to 
resources and Federal contracting op-
portunities. 
But Congress alone cannot reverse 
the increasing insularity of the Federal 
contracting process; SBA must work 
with large agencies that are driving 
these trends in Federal contracting to 
ensure that small businesses are given 
opportunities to become prime con-
tractors and supply the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
Treasurer Carranza’s prior experience 
should serve her well at the SBA. In 
nearly 30 years at UPS, where she 
began as a part-time package handler, 
Treasurer Carranza became the highest 
ranking Latina in the history of the 
company. She also served in govern-
ment as Deputy Administrator of SBA 
under President George W. Bush, dur-
ing which she chaired the SBA’s Office 
of Small and Disadvantaged Business 
Utilization Council. 
At a time when America’s small busi-
nesses are experiencing rapid demo-
graphic changes and new challenges, 
SBA needs bold and innovative leader-
ship. I am optimistic that Treasurer 
Carranza can be the leader and advo-
cate that SBA and American small 
businesses need right now. I support 
her nomination. I urge my colleagues 
to approve her nomination as the SBA 
Administrator. 
With that, I yield the floor.

f 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to 
talk about an issue that the Senate 
may address on the floor this week. 
Tomorrow in the Senate Finance 
Committee, we are going to take up 
the renegotiated North American Free 
Trade Agreement. 
One of my proudest votes as a Mem-
ber of the House a long time ago was to 
vote against the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, to vote against 
NAFTA. I have voted no on every trade 
agreement since then because every 
trade agreement that has come in front 
of this body was written by corporate 
interests for their corporate executives 
and stockholders. They maximize prof-
its always—every one of these trade 
agreements—CAFTA, NAFTA, PNTR 
with China, which is not technically a 
trade agreement, but it quacks like a 
duck and walks like a duck. Every one 
of these trade agreements, in every 
case, has looked out for corporate in-
terests and jettisoned the interests of 
workers. 
We see the consequences. Corporate 
profits soar every time. Executive com-
pensation explodes upward every time. 
Workers continue to produce more 
than ever before. Even though cor-
porate profits are up and executive 
compensation is up, workers’ wages are 
flat. Often, they can’t join a union, and 
the middle class continues to shrink. 
I know what that has meant in the 
Presiding Officer’s State of Arkansas. I 
know what it has meant in Ohio. I 
know what it has done to my home-
town of Mansfield. I know what these 
trade agreements do to Dayton and 
Cleveland and Cincinnati and Canton 
and Youngstown and Toledo. 
Then-Candidate Trump said that he 
was going to renegotiate NAFTA. Well, 
that was his promise. He did, but he 
gave us the same thing. His economic 
policies overall have been that, but his 
renegotiated NAFTA, which he brought 
to this Congress originally—the nego-
tiation that he made with Mexico and 
Canada—was another corporate trade 
agreement written for corporate inter-
ests. 
Again, this President betrays work-
ers with his tax giveaways to corpora-
tions, to his judges who put their 
thumbs on the scale, choosing corpora-
tions over workers, choosing Wall 
Street over consumers. 
Then, last year, as he has done one 
betrayal of workers after another, 
squeezing the middle class even more— 
last year, when we got the initial draft 
of this agreement from the administra-
tion, the renegotiated NAFTA was an-
other betrayal. 
His first NAFTA draft was nowhere 
near the good deal for workers that 
President Trump promised. He had fun-
damentally negotiated another cor-
porate trade deal—a deal that helps 
corporate executives, that helps stock-
holders, that betrays workers again 
and again, another trade deal just like 
that. It meant nothing for workers. It 
meant a sellout to drug companies. It 
took us months of fighting alongside 
Speaker PELOSI
and Senator WYDEN 
and trade unions to improve this deal 
and take the real and important steps 
toward putting workers at the center 
of our trade policies. 
These trade policies should be writ-
ten for workers so that they increase 
their income and expand the middle 
class, not written for corporations in 
trickle-down economics. We know what 
happens on every tax bill that comes 
before this Congress, written by the ad-
ministration and Senator MCCONNELL. 
We know it is the same thing. Instead 
of building the economy from the mid-
dle out so that the middle class grows 
and America overwhelmingly prospers, 
just like the tax cuts—the tax cuts for 
the rich that may, they tell us, trickle 
down and help the middle class—that is 
the way this trade agreement was writ-
ten. That is the way these tax bills in 
this Congress were written. 
It took months of fighting alongside 
Senator WYDEN
and organized labor 
and Speaker PELOSI. We now have a 
provision in the labor chapter, and the 
President has finally agreed to this 
provision. He knew he wasn’t going to 
get a renegotiated NAFTA unless he 
followed what we said on workers. For 
the first time, we have a provision in 
the labor chapter. 
For instance, it says that violence 
against workers is always a violation 
of the agreement. The language the 
President gave us said: Well, the first 
time you commit violence against 
workers, we might fine you. The second 
time, we might fine you. Only if you do 
it over and over is it a violation. Real-
ly? If there is violence against workers, 
the people who committed that vio-
lence ought to pay for it. So we fixed 
that in this agreement. 
We have improved some of the 
legalese that since the beginning has 
been included in trade agreements to 
make it nearly impossible to success-
fully win a case when a country vio-
lates its labor commitments. 
We secured the Wyden provision, 
which amounts to, by far, the strongest 
ever labor enforcement in the U.S. 
trade deal. This provision that Senator 
WYDEN and I wrote and fought for is 
the first improvement to enforcing 
labor standards in our trade agree-
ments since we have been negotiating 
them. 
We know why companies closed fac-
tories in Ohio and opened them in Mex-
ico. They can pay lower wages. They 
can take advantage of workers who 
don’t have rights. They can keep 
unions 
from 
organizing. 
American 
workers can’t compete with that kind 
of low-wage lack of enforcement of 
labor laws. What happens? There is a 
race to the bottom on wages. So if a 
company threatens to move to Mexico 
and they tell their workforce ‘‘We are 
going to move unless you do some wage 
givebacks,’’ they either move and the 
American workers lose their jobs or 
they use that as a way to put down-
ward pressure on wages for American 
workers. 
I know what that has done to Mans-
field, OH. I know what it has done to 
Gallipolis, Chillicothe, Zanesville, Day-
ton, Huber Heights, and every other 
community. The only way to stop this 
is by raising labor standards in every 
country we trade with and, most im-
portantly, making sure those standards 
are actually enforced. If corporations 
are forced to pay workers a living wage 
and treat them with dignity no matter 
where the workers are, we take away 
the incentive for those companies to 
move jobs abroad. That is what the 
Brown-Wyden provision does. 
A worker in Mexico now, under this 
agreement—the reason I am supporting 
this, the first-ever trade agreement 
that I am supporting—workers in Mex-
ico will be able to report a company 
that is violating their rights. They can 
actually call a toll-free number and re-
port violations against the workers. A

January 6, 2020 
worker can actually make that re-
quest. They have never had that right 
in Mexico. They, often enough, don’t 
have it here. We can then determine 
whether worker rights have been vio-
lated and then take action against the 
company that did it. We have never 
done it that way. We haven’t had good 
results because of that. 
We can apply punitive damages when 
companies stop workers from orga-
nizing. If they keep doing it, we stop 
their goods from coming into the 
United States. You enforce it at the 
factory level by saying: If you keep 
violating this trade agreement, you are 
not sending your products into the 
United States. That will make them 
behave. 
When Mexican workers have the 
power to form real unions and nego-
tiate for higher wages, it helps our 
workers. Right now, Mexican workers 
can be paid as little as $6.50—not an 
hour but a day. We have been asking 
American workers to compete with 
that. We have already heard some crit-
ics say that Brown-Wyden will force 
Mexican wages to rise. I plead guilty. 
That is the entire point—to take away 
the incentive. If Mexican wages go up, 
it makes U.S. companies less likely to 
shut down production in Steubenville 
or Lisbon or in Bryan, OH, and move 
overseas. It takes away the incentive 
for those companies to relocate. 
I want to be clear. I will always be 
straight with American workers. This 
is not a perfect agreement. One trade 
deal that Democrats fixed will not 
undo the rest of Trump’s economic 
policies that put corporations over 
workers. 
This deal will not stop outsourcing 
when we have President Trump’s tax 
plan that gives companies a tax break 
to send American jobs to Mexico. Here 
is how the President’s tax bill that was 
rammed through this Senate a year or 
so ago works: If you are in Springfield, 
OH, your corporate tax rate is 21 per-
cent. If you move—pull up stakes and 
move to Mexico or anywhere else—your 
tax rate is 10.5 percent. Even with this 
good trade agreement, we cannot stop 
that kind of outsourcing because the 
President insists on helping his cor-
porate buddies. 
I will keep fighting his corporate 
trade policies and tax policies just as 
we did in this agreement. We have a lot 
more work to do to make our trade 
agreements more pro-worker. 
I will vote yes for the first time ever 
on a trade agreement because, by in-
cluding Brown-Wyden, Democrats have 
made this agreement much more pro- 
worker. We set an important precedent 
for the future that Brown-Wyden must 
now be included in every trade agree-
ment in the years ahead. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ALFRED J. RIOUX 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to pay 
tribute to Alfred J. Rioux, a dedicated 
public servant, advocate, and friend to 
many. Sadly, Mr. Rioux passed away 
on November 9, 2019, at the age of 85. 
He will be remembered for his commit-
ment to Connecticut and his jovial 
spirit. 
Born in Hartford, CT, Al served in 
the Navy as a seaman 2nd class and 
deep-sea diver on the USS Skylark dur-
ing the Korean war. Once discharged, 
he started an apprenticeship in Hart-
ford for the Arrow-Hart Hegeman Com-
pany as a tool and die engineer. 
Upon moving to Newington, CT, with 
his family, Al began working in real es-
tate and insurance. At the same time, 
he became a member of the Con-
necticut Home Builders Association, 
helping to develop single-family homes 
in his town. This initial involvement in 
Newington would serve as the catalyst 
for Al’s lifelong devotion to Con-
necticut politics. 
In the 1970s and 1980s, some of Al’s 
pivotal roles included helping Bill Cot-
ter successfully win his first term in 
the U.S. House of Representatives, 
serving as an aide to Congressman Cot-
ter, 
a 
15-year 
position 
as 
the 
Newington Democratic Party’s Town 
chairman, 
and 
attending 
the 
1980 
Democratic National Convention as a 
delegate in support of President Jimmy 
Carter. He also served two terms as the 
sheriff of Hartford County. 
Al gave back to his communities out-
side of politics, as well. In one of the 
first kidney transplants performed at 
Hartford Hospital through Dr. Robert 
Schweitzer and Dr. Stanley Bartus’s 
transplant program, Al received a kid-
ney from his sister, Dorothy Williams, 
in 1975. This successful operation led 
him to organize the Connecticut Kid-
ney Research Fund Golf Tournament. 
Throughout its many years, the tour-
nament helped raise hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in support of Hartford 
Hospital’s kidney transplant research. 
Through his involvement in Con-
necticut politics, transplant advocacy, 
and numerous organizations, Al left a 
lasting impression on everyone around 
him thanks to his zeal for life and read-
iness to help others. 
My wife Cynthia and I extend our 
deepest sympathies to Al’s family dur-
ing this difficult time, particularly to 
his wife Elma and his many children, 
grandchildren, 
and 
great-grand-
children. May their many wonderful 
memories of Al provide them solace 
and comfort.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING ALL AMERICAN 
BEEF BATTALION 
∑ Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the commendable 
actions of the group known as All 
American Beef Battalion, which pro-
vided an immeasurable service to our 
veterans, active servicemembers, and 
their families at Fort Carson in Colo-
rado Springs, CO, on Veterans Day. 
Bill Broadie, a veteran who was in-
jured during the Vietnam war, was dis-
mayed to find on his return home that 
anti-war protesters were not just op-
posed to the conflict, but actively di-
rected their ire at troops returning 
from the war. After the events of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, Broadie—now a cattle-
man in Kansas—wanted to provide a 
service that showed the troops about to 
deploy into war that their service 
would not go unappreciated. In 2008, 
the All American Beef Battalion was 
born. 
Broadie utilized his cowboy instincts 
to come up with an innovative way to 
show the appreciation he and so many 
American men and women feel toward 
these brave servicemembers: a ribeye 
steak dinner for the servicemembers 
and their loved ones. With that pur-
pose, the volunteers at the All Amer-
ican Beef Battalion have served over 
400,000 people across 26 States, includ-
ing my home State of Colorado, where 
they have hosted these dinners at least 
10 times. 
On November 10, 2019, they served 150 
veterans and their families at the Fra-
ternal Order of Eagles No. 143 in Colo-
rado Springs, CO. This provided a won-
derful way for these men and women to 
celebrate our Nation’s 101st Veterans 
Day and, as a special treat for the 
former U.S. Marines present there, the 
244th birthday of the U.S. Marine 
Corps. 
Our 
country’s 
military 
servicemembers, both veterans and Ac-
tive Duty, sacrifice so much in defense 
of our freedoms. I am so pleased that 
the All American Beef Battalion has 
found a unique way to show these 
brave men and women how much we 
appreciate their service.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. CANTWELL): 
S. 3150. A bill to establish a pilot pro-
gram for native plant species, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Native Plant 
Species Pilot Program Act. I am 
pleased to be partnering with Senator 
CANTWELL on this initiative. Our bipar-
tisan bill supports a new pilot program 
at the National Park Service (NPS) to 
support the use of native plants. This 
legislation also encourages the Park 
Service to review existing data and 
study the cost-effectiveness of using 
native plants. 
Native plants are species found natu-
rally in regions and can provide valu-
able functions to our National Park 
System. Benefits range from using less 
water and pesticides, purifying the air, 
and recharging groundwater in wet-
lands. By using native species, the 
Park Service can also improve habitat 
for wildlife and restore important spe-
cies of birds and butterflies to their 
natural habitat. 
In Acadia National Park, native 
plants are an important part of the on-
going conservation work. I commend 
Superintendent Kevin Schneider and 
all those who work on these issues at 
the park for their work to encourage 
the use of native plants. Acadia Na-
tional Park protects more than 900 
plant species, including some that are 
globally, nationally, and locally rare. 
Native plants, however, face many 
threats such as non-native pests, non- 
native plants, diseases, and a changing 
climate. Today, almost one quarter of 
Acadia National Park’s species are 
non-native to the park. The tree spe-
cies of Acadia, the red spruce, is pro-
jected to lose a substantial amount of 
its habitat in coming decades as a re-
sult of climate change. In addition, 
invasive pests, such as Emerald Ash 
Borer and the hemlock woody adelgid 
are impacting northern forests, and the 
emerald ash borer has already been 
identified in Maine. 
This bill will ensure that we preserve 
Maine’s cultural history and natural 
heritage. Acadia’s native plant commu-
nities includes many iconic species 
such as the blueberry barrens near the 
mountain summits, the towering white 
pines in older forests, and the cran-
berry bogs along Northeast Creek that 
contribute to Maine’s iconic landscape. 
Other native plants in Maine are the 
wildflowers that bloom in August and 
September, such as asters and golden-
rods, helping to attract the more than 
3.5 million visitors a year to one of the 
seventh most-visited national parks in 
the United States. 
I am pleased to report that our bipar-
tisan bill has earned the support of the 
Garden Club of America, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation 
to help protect the natural landscapes 
at our national parks and keep native 
plants thriving for years to come. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

S. RES. 463 
Resolved, That rule I of the Rules of Proce-
dure and Practice in the Senate When Sit-
ting on Impeachment Trials is amended to 
read as follows: 
‘‘I. Whensoever the Senate shall receive 
notice from the House of Representatives 
that managers are appointed on their part to 
conduct an impeachment against any person 
and are directed to carry articles of im-
peachment to the Senate, the Secretary of 
the Senate shall immediately inform the 
House of Representatives that the Senate is 
ready to receive the managers for the pur-
pose of exhibiting such articles of impeach-
ment, agreeably to such notice. If, following 
adoption of such articles, the House of Rep-
resentatives does not so notify the Senate or 
otherwise provide for such articles to be ex-
hibited to the Senate within 25 calendar days 
from the date of adoption of such articles, as 
recorded in the Journal of the House of Rep-
resentatives, such articles shall be deemed 
exhibited before the Senate and it shall be in 
order for any Senator to offer a motion to 
dismiss such articles with prejudice for fail-
ure by the House of Representatives to pros-
ecute such articles. Such motion shall be 
adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority 
of the Senators, duly chosen and sworn, 
without debate by the yeas and nays, which 
shall be entered on the record.’’. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, it has 
been 19 days today—19 days—since the 
House of Representatives impeached 
the President of the United States. It 
has been 19 days since we were told 
that it was urgent that President 
Trump be impeached and removed from 
office. It was urgent for the safety of 
the country. It was urgent for national 
security. It was urgent to protect the 
Constitution of the United States. It 
was urgent; it had to be done now. The 
articles had to be rushed through. The 
rules had to be violated. There couldn’t 
be due process. It was urgent. 
Where are we now? Nineteen days 
later, the Speaker of the House has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S26 
January 6, 2020 
still not transmitted the articles to 
this body for a trial, has still not ap-
pointed managers for a trial, has still 
not exhibited the articles before this 
body for a trial. 
We now have the longest delay in 
American history in providing notice 
to this body and actually moving for-
ward with a trial, and now I think we 
have a better sense of what was urgent. 
What was urgent was fulfilling the par-
tisan vendetta that the Speaker of the 
House and the Democrats have against 
this President. What was urgent was 
overturning the results of an election 
that they have never accepted. That is 
what was urgent. 
But now—now that it is time to actu-
ally try the case—well, now the Speak-
er and the Democrats aren’t so sure. In 
fact, now they don’t seem to want a 
trial. Now, when it is time to put up or 
shut up, actually put the evidence for-
ward to be judged, Speaker PELOSI is 
saying that she may withhold the arti-
cles indefinitely and prevent this body 
indefinitely from carrying out its con-
stitutional responsibilities—after, of 
course, a bipartisan coalition in the 
House of Representatives voted against 
impeachment. 
I think we can probably see, the 
longer we wait, why the Speaker is so 
reluctant now to have a trial. It was a 
purely partisan process in the House. 
She had Democrats abandon her and 
vote with Republicans in a bipartisan 
coalition against impeachment. The 
articles don’t even allege a crime. This 
was the first time in American history 
in the impeachment of a President in 
which no crime was even alleged in the 
articles, no evidence of a crime even 
presented. No wonder she doesn’t want 
to have a trial. No wonder she is now 
sitting on the articles and will not per-
mit a Senate trial to begin. 
Well, here is the problem with that: 
The Constitution of the United States 
is really clear. The House has the 
power to impeach. They have done 
that. But the Senate—and the Senate 
alone—has the power to try. 
The Constitution, article I, says that 
the Senate has the sole power to try 
impeachment cases, to adjudicate what 
has happened in the House, to examine 
the facts, and to render a judgment of 
some sort. Now the House Speaker is 
attempting to prevent the Senate from 
carrying out its constitutional respon-
sibilities, its constitutional preroga-
tive. 
All of this division and rancor—all of 
this bitterness that she has put the 
country through now for months on 
end—she apparently wants to continue 
indefinitely and deny this body its con-
stitutional responsibility to conduct a 
trial. 
It has been 19 days. It could be 90 
days. It could be 190 days. There is 
nothing that will stop the Speaker 
from sitting on these articles indefi-
nitely. They could persist into the 
President’s second term, if and when he 
is reelected. That is the situation we 
are now facing. 
If Americans are sick of this im-
peachment saga, this partisan circus 
now, just wait until we are still sitting 
here in October or January of next 
year or January of the year following 
or who knows when without a trial, 
without adjudication, without any res-
olution. That is why it is time for this 
body to act. 
It is time for the Senate to act to 
preserve the Constitution’s separation 
of powers, to preserve the Constitu-
tion’s guarantees—the right to due 
process, the right for the President to 
be heard, the right for the American 
people to have these Articles of Im-
peachment adjudicated, resolved, as 
the Constitution commits to and pro-
vides for. That is why today I am intro-
ducing a resolution to update the Sen-
ate’s rules to account for this unprece-
dented attempt by the Speaker of the 
House to delay, to deny, to obstruct a 
trial in the U.S. Senate. 
Let’s be clear. This has never been 
done before. It has not even been 
thought of before. Nobody had thought, 
before Speaker PELOSI launched this 
gambit 19 days ago, that the House 
could sit on Articles of Impeachment 
indefinitely in order to stop a Senate 
trial. 
If the Constitution is going to remain 
in effect, if the Senate is going to have 
the power, as the Constitution pro-
vides, to try cases, if the President is 
going to get his day in court, if the 
American people are going to have the 
ability to have this issue resolved, to 
see the facts, to get a verdict, the Sen-
ate has to act. 
Today I am proposing new rules in 
the U.S. Senate that will set a time 
limit on the actions of the House. It 
will give the House Speaker 25 days 
from the date that the articles are 
adopted and published to transmit 
those articles here to the Senate, to ex-
hibit them as the House rules and Sen-
ate rules currently speak of and antici-
pate, and if that is not done, if in 25 
days the House Speaker has not acted 
so that the Senate is able to move for-
ward with a trial, then, under my reso-
lution and the change in the rules that 
I propose today, the Senate would be 
able to introduce a motion to dismiss 
these articles for lack of prosecution. 
In the real world, when a prosecutor 
brings a case but refuses to try it, the 
court has the ability and the defendant 
has the right—a constitutional right, I 
might add—to have those indictments, 
those charges, dismissed. That is pre-
cisely the action that I am proposing 
today. 
It is time to update the Senate’s 
rules to account for this unprecedented 
attempt at obstruction, at denial, at 
delay. It is time for the Senate to act. 
The House has a simple choice in 
front of it—or it should. That choice is 
to send the Articles of Impeachment to 
this body to be tried before this body, 
to exhibit the evidence that it has to 
make the case that it can, however 
poor that case may be, but to make the 
case that it can and to allow the Amer-
ican people the right to have this reso-
lution achieved, the right to have the 
evidence tried, the right to have the 
verdict rendered. 
It is time for the Senate to act to en-
sure that the constitutional balance of 
power, the constitutional separation of 
powers, and the basic functioning of 
this government of our Republic are 
able to go forward. This is a matter of 
great urgency. There is nothing more 
serious than an attempt to overturn 
the results of a democratic election 
and to remove from office a sitting 
President, and that is exactly what is 
happening now. 
It is imperative that we act. The 
country deserves it. It is imperative for 
future Congresses and for the future of 
the country that the Constitution not 
be subverted in this rush by Speaker
