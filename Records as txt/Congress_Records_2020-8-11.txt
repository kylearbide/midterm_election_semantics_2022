tinue to rule from Heaven so that Your 
purposes will prevail on Earth. 
Hear the cries of the helpless and do 
for them through our lawmakers what

MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
there has been a lot of focus lately on 
the drama here in Washington. For 
weeks 
now, 
as 
leading 
Democrats 
blocked more pandemic relief over un-
related liberal demands, the press has 
covered their stonewalling like any or-
dinary political standoff. Who talked 
to whom? Who said what in which 
meeting? 
What 
new 
metaphor 
did 
Speaker PELOSI use today to explain 
that she was blocking progress? But it 
does the Nation a disservice to act like 
the last several weeks were just an-
other routine political standoff. It does 
struggling families and laid-off work-
ers and stressed-out school principals 
and healthcare professionals a dis-
service to act like this has just been 
more Washington gridlock. 
The New York Times proclaimed a 
few days ago that ‘‘[Speaker] PELOSI is 
playing hardball on coronavirus re-
lief.’’ Well, that is one way to put it. 
You could say it is ‘‘playing hardball’’ 
to refuse any outcome for the country. 
You could say it is ‘‘playing hardball’’ 
to insist on non-COVID-related liberal 
policy changes that the Speaker and 
the Democratic leader know would 
never pass the Senate or be signed into 
law by the President. 
But 
if 
Democrats 
are 
‘‘playing 
hardball,’’ their opponents aren’t us 
Republicans—not really. 
They are playing hardball against 
kids, workers, and vulnerable Ameri-
cans who need help. 
They are playing hardball against 
our medical system when the Speaker 
and the Democratic leader say they 
won’t allow another dime for testing, 
treatments, or vaccines unless they 
can bring home a massive tax cut for 
millionaires in San Francisco and New 
York City. 
They are playing hardball against 
our Nation’s ability to detect and fight 
the virus. 
They are playing hardball against 
science when the Speaker and the 
Democratic leader say they will not 
allow another cent for schools to re-
open or for the job-saving PPP unless 
they get $1 trillion for a State and 
local slush fund that is completely out 
of proportion to actual needs. 
They are playing hardball against 
children and parents when the Speaker 
and the Democratic leader say they 
will not allow any resolution on any 
issue unless Democrats can pay people 
more not to work. 
They are playing hardball against 
millions of households that ought to 
get another stimulus check and against 
the ability of jobless people to get any 
Federal benefit whatsoever. 
There are life-and-death matters at 
stake, but Democrats have treated this 
historic national crisis as a political 
game. Just look at the redlines the 
Democratic leaders have drawn around 
these negotiations. Imagine sitting 
down with a working family at their 
kitchen table and explaining that these 
are the kinds of issues over which the 
Speaker and the Democratic leader are 
refusing—refusing—to let them have 
relief. 
First, as I mentioned, the Demo-
cratic leader has made clear he doesn’t 
want any pandemic relief to become 
law unless—unless—it carries a special 
State and local tax carve-out for high 
earners in places like New York. 
Just imagine these Democratic lead-
ers from New York and San Francisco 
going anywhere in the middle of the 
country and telling a working family 
of four, earning $40,000 a year, that 
they aren’t getting a relief check that 
could increase their income by 10 per-
cent until millionaires in Manhattan 
get a tax cut. 
Economists on all sides have panned 
this. A huge, costly tax cut for wealthy 
people in blue States is not the life raft 
that struggling people need. Even lib-
eral economists have jumped ship. Here 
is what one self-identified progressive 
told reporters: ‘‘This is not a good idea. 
. . . It would not help the economy 
heal and it would not benefit the peo-
ple who need help.’’ These are the 
economists on their side? But forget 
about the experts. Forget about laid-off 
people. Forget about Middle America. 
The Speaker and the Democratic lead-
er want to cut off funding for our war 
with the coronavirus unless they get 
this special carve-out.

August 11, 2020 
Here is another one of those dead-on- 
arrival demands: Democrats insist that 
working families, small businesses, and 
healthcare providers will not get any 
more help unless a new trillion-dollar 
slush fund for poorly managed States 
tags along. Bear in mind that States 
and localities have only spent about a 
fourth—a fourth—of the money we al-
ready sent them last spring. 
Even Senate Democrats seem to ac-
knowledge this, for example, by spon-
soring legislation that would extend 
the deadline for the States to spend 
down their CARES Act aid. The States 
need extra time to spend what we have 
already sent them, and the serious esti-
mates of the COVID shortfall that 
State and local governments may face 
are 
a 
fraction—a 
fraction—of 
the 
Democrats’ 
trillion-dollar 
demand. 
Their demands aren’t based on math. 
They aren’t based on the pandemic. 
They want a massive slush fund to 
make up for decades of mismanage-
ment. 
It is just how the Speaker explained 
her view of the crisis. This is what she 
said: 
This is an opportunity. Every crisis is. 
That same opportunism leads them 
to another absurd demand. Democrats 
say nobody should get any more help 
unless—unless—the 
Federal 
Govern-
ment sends out jobless benefits that 
pay more than what people made work-
ing. Republicans support extending a 
Federal 
supplement 
for 
unemploy-
ment—make no mistake about that— 
but we share the view of Democrats 
like the House Democratic majority, 
the senior Senator from Maryland, the 
Democratic Governor of Connecticut, 
all of whom indicated it should be do-
able to land somewhere smarter than a 
flat $600. 
This is not complicated. Both sides 
want to help unemployed people. Re-
publicans never wanted the Federal 
benefit to lapse to zero and tried to ex-
tend the money. But as our economy 
tries to reopen, there is no reason 
Uncle Sam should take taxes out of es-
sential workers’ paychecks to pay 
other people more to stay home. 
This is just a flavor of the Demo-
cratic demands. The two parties should 
have been able to agree on a huge 
sweep of subjects—from testing to 
school money, legal protection to di-
rect payments and more. Republicans 
wanted to reach an agreement every-
where we could and then continue to 
fight over the contested questions 
later. Democrats said no because they 
know their unrelated wish-list items 
would have no prayer—no prayer—of 
standing on their own merit. 
Only these hostage tactics could pos-
sibly get their bad ideas across the fin-
ish line. So struggling people have 
waited and waited and gotten nothing. 
That has been the Democrats’ decision. 
Reporters can call it ‘‘hardball,’’ like 
this was some ordinary standstill, but 
families are suffering. Americans are 
dying. This is not a Washington game; 
it is a national crisis. It would serve 
the Nation better if the Democratic 
leaders would act like it is a crisis.

Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, 
America is living through a crisis that 
exceeds anything we have seen in gen-
erations. Other countries were able to 
test their populations, isolate cases, 
and contain the spread of the disease, 
but here the failure of the Trump ad-
ministration to develop or implement a 
national strategy to defeat COVID on 
the health front and economically has 
meant that the disease has raged 
through our country for 7 months, is 
still spreading, and the economy is in 
very bad shape. 
We have over 5 million confirmed 
cases of COVID–19. It just took 17 days 
to go from 4 million Americans with 
COVID to 5 million. Unemployment is 
higher than it ever was during the 
great 
recession. 
More 
than 
150,000 
Americans have died. Small businesses 
every day are closing, and those that 
are still open are struggling. Families 
can’t afford to feed their children. 
Americans can’t pay the rent and will 
be thrown out of their homes. Millions 
are out of work, and many more worry 
that they will be out of work in the 
month or two to come. This is a huge 
crisis. 
In this time of national emergency, 
Democrats believe we must focus on 
the health and economic security of 
the American people. If we don’t ad-
dress the health crisis, nothing else 
will matter, but we have to focus on 
economic security as well. 
We have to keep Americans in their 
homes, put food on the table, prevent 
them from slipping into further hard-
ship and poverty. That is what ani-
mated Democrats to develop a $3.4 tril-
lion plan to finally crush the virus and 
rescue American families. It was based 
on the needs of our country, both 
health and economic, the needs of our 
schools and businesses and workers and 
our healthcare system. We Democrats 
tell America, We have your back. Un-
fortunately, our Republican friends do 
not. 
In our negotiations with the White 
House, Chief of Staff Meadows and Sec-
retary Mnuchin were unable to go 
above $1 trillion, and their $1 trillion 
was far short of the country’s needs. 
Democrats offered to come down by $1 
trillion. We asked our counterparts— 
Secretary Mnuchin, Mr. Meadows—to 
come up by $1 trillion, meet us in the 
middle. They said no. 
So last Friday, after our negotiating 
session with the White House, I made it 
clear that the reasons our talks had 
stalled was that the White House had 
basically declared ‘‘my way or the 
highway.’’ They were unwilling to 
meet us in the middle. They said that 
in the room. I guess imitation is the 
sincerest form of flattery because now 
Leader MCCONNELL is blaming Demo-
crats for the breakdown in negotia-
tions, using the exact same language. 
He said Democrats are the ones saying 
‘‘my way or the highway.’’ Seriously, 
that is what the Republican leader, 
who wasn’t even in the room and will 
not dare go in the room, claims. 
Let’s go over the facts—the facts. We 
said to the White House: We are willing 
to come down by $1 trillion. Will you 
come up by $1 trillion and meet us in 
the middle? The White House said: No, 
we are not budging. So to whom does 
this logic apply? Who is intransigent? 
Who is really saying ‘‘my way or the 
highway?’’ The answer is obvious. This 
is not a ‘‘both sides to blame’’ situa-
tion. 
Democrats 
are 
willing 
to 
com-
promise. Republicans are being intran-
sigent and will not move from their po-
sition, which is totally inadequate for 
the needs of America during the great-
est economic crisis we have had in 75 
years and the greatest health crisis in 
100. That is where we are: Democrats 
willing to move and meet in the mid-
dle, Republicans intransigent. Repub-
licans declared ‘‘my way or the high-
way,’’ and rather than defend their po-
sition, they falsely accuse Democrats 
of doing the same. 
Now, rather than trying to break the 
logjam, as a true Presidential leader 
should, President Trump sits on the 
sidelines and just issued a bunch of 
weak and unworkable Executive or-
ders. He slashed the enhanced unem-
ployment benefits, asked the Ameri-
cans who are out of work, through no 
fault of their own, to take a pay cut. 
He deferred the payroll tax, which even 
Republicans admit will do nothing to 
help our workers and the economy and 
would undermine Social Security and 
Medicare to boot. And the President’s 
Executive order on evictions is more 
like an Executive suggestion. It doesn’t

even guarantee a moratorium on evic-
tions. It merely instructs Federal agen-
cies to ‘‘review’’ or ‘‘consider’’ one and 
does nothing to help renters actually 
afford the rent. 
Here in Congress, the Senate Repub-
lican majority delayed for 4 long 
months, failed to come up with a pro-
posal that had the support of their own 
caucus, and then gave up and left it for 
someone else to figure it out. That is 
why MCCONNELL is not in the room. 
Facing the greatest domestic crisis in 
the 21st century, where Americans are 
hurting healthwise and economically, 
the Senate Republican majority ran 
down the clock, tossed up an air ball, 
and then subbed themselves out of the 
game. 
Even now, as Leader MCCONNELL 
claims that Democrats are blocking re-
lief, there are 20 Members of the Re-
publican caucus, according to their 
own leader, who will not vote for any-
thing—no more relief. A group of Re-
publican Senators came to the floor 
last week to warn America about the 
national debt, not the health crisis, not 
the economic crisis, not the looming 
housing crisis but the national debt. It 
is something that concerned those 
same Members very little when adding 
nearly $2 trillion to the debt in order 
to give big corporations a giant tax cut 
in 2017. 
Listen to this one: The Senator from 
Wisconsin, Mr. JOHNSON, said yester-
day: 
From my standpoint, the breakdown in 
talks is very good news. I hope the talks re-
main broke down. 
Let me repeat that. Senator JOHNSON 
said: 
From my standpoint— 
Reflecting the views of many Repub-
lican Senators— 
the breakdown in talks is very good news. I 
hope the talks remain broke down. 
Why did he say that? Because he 
doesn’t want to spend one more nickel. 
Despite the huge health crisis, the 
huge economic crisis, people losing 
their jobs, small businesses closing, we 
shouldn’t spend a nickel. This is not 
both sides. This is one side only. 
When 
President 
Trump 
called 
COVID–19 a hoax and told the country 
to go take bleach and other quack 
medicines, some of my friends here 
made disappointed noises. But when 
the President said the virus would just 
disappear, it seems the Republican 
Senate bought it. 
After we came together to pass the 
CARES 
Act, 
Republican 
Senators 
pushed all their chips to the middle to 
bet with President Trump that the 
virus was going to miraculously dis-
appear. The Republican leader said: I 
am going to put the Senate on ‘‘pause’’ 
and see what happens. Last week, he 
actually defended that position, saying 
that his delay ‘‘allowed us to learn the 
coronavirus didn’t mysteriously dis-
appear.’’ Millions more people out of 
work, hundreds of thousands of small 
businesses closing, many more people 
getting COVID and some more people 
dying, and, now, after all that, the Re-
publican leader says his delay ‘‘allowed 
us to learn the coronavirus didn’t mys-
teriously disappear.’’ 
So while President Trump and his 
aides have certainly been an impedi-
ment—an awful impediment to an 
agreement, the Republican Senate is 
equally culpable, and the American 
people know it. They know that Demo-
crats have their back, healthwise and 
economically. Republicans, so many of 
them, are saying: Don’t do a thing. 
Don’t do a thing. They are glad the ne-
gotiations have broken down. We are 
not. 
f 
U.S. POSTAL SERVICE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, one 
final matter, millions of Americans 
rely on the U.S. Postal Service to de-
liver their mail reliably and on time. 
For decades, the hard-working people 
of the Postal Service have been doing 
just that. During this pandemic, USPS 
has been providing these critical serv-
ices day in and day out, up until the 
new Postmaster General, Mr. DeJoy, a 
top Republican donor and Trump ally 
with no experience in the Postal Serv-
ice, was installed at the helm. 
Administering a national election is 
difficult in normal times. In the time 
of COVID, it will undoubtedly be an 
even greater challenge. We need to in-
stitute policies and devote resources to 
make sure every American can both 
safely and confidently vote in person 
and by mail. By the way, even just as 
important, we need to make sure 
Americans get their medicines on time, 
that the elderly and those with pre-
existing conditions who are staying in 
their homes and not going out are able 
to get their necessities by mail. Your 
pills are a week late—I know what that 
is like. It has happened to me. Fortu-
nately, I don’t have medicines that my 
life depends on. It causes you huge anx-
iety about your health. This Post-
master is cutting overtime, cutting 
employees, when, at a time of COVID, 
we need more help, not less. But elec-
tions should certainly concern Ameri-
cans as well. 
The current issues of the post office 
should alarm every American. The new 
Postmaster 
General 
has 
instituted 
policies that have contributed to inex-
cusable delays in mail delivery. But 
now, topping the cake, the Postal Serv-
ice has informed some States that they 
may need to pay a first-class rate to 
deliver ballots rather than the normal 
rate, nearly tripling the cost. At a time 
when people will have to vote by mail 
in record numbers because they can’t 
or will not go vote in person, the Post-
master General is saying we should tri-
ple the rate of costs to vote by mail? 
What a despicable derogation of democ-
racy. 
What is his rationale? It is a small 
amount of money. Ballots are a small 
percentage of the mail that is deliv-
ered. It is to discourage people from 
voting. He ought to be ashamed of him-
self to even consider this, tripling—tri-
pling what it costs to vote by mail at 
a time when more people will vote by 
mail than ever before. If anyone had 
any thought that this Postmaster Gen-
eral was on the level, it is now dis-
pensed. 
To triple the cost of voting by mail 
would be an outrageous and insidious 
policy that would make it even harder 
and more expensive for States, already 
struggling with depleted budgets from 
COVID–19, to conduct our elections 
safely. Democrats will fight this policy 
with every tool at our disposal. If our 
Republican colleagues care about a free 
and fair election this November, they 
should as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I so appreciate the comments of the 
minority leader. 
f 
HOUSING 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
oftentimes, when I am home and I am 
talking to constituents in Nevada, they 
look at Washington as a bubble. They 
don’t really think that things happen 
here unless they see it on the news or 
they have no trust in us really coming 
together to work on behalf of our con-
stituents. 
I think it is time we focus on what 
needs to be done in the best interest of 
our country than focusing on political 
gain or gamesmanship. 
The reason why I say that is, I don’t 
know about the President pro tempore, 
but I know every single Senator comes 
from a State, and they care about their 
constituents. They get emails from 
their constituents and letters from 
their constituents. When we go home, 
we claim to be in a recess, but it is not 
really a recess. We are home working. 
We are talking to our constituents and 
businesses and the individuals who are 
there. And if we are really listening to 
our constituents, particularly at a 
time like now, when this pandemic has 
created the worst health crisis we have 
seen not just in this country but 
around the world and has contributed 
to an economic crisis, then we are 
hearing from our constituents that 
they are struggling right now. 
The reason they are struggling is be-
cause we have asked them to stay at 
home and shelter in place to stem the 
spread of this virus. We have said: Lis-
ten, we don’t have a vaccine. We are 
working on it, but we don’t have it 
right away. We need to ramp up our 
tests so we can make sure you can get 
it, and quickly, to determine whether 
you have this virus or the antibodies so 
we can then quarantine you and shelter 
you. But until we even get to that 
point, we have asked everybody to stay 
home. And they have done it. 
I know in my State of Nevada, we 
have the highest unemployment rate in 
this country right now—25 percent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5388 
August 11, 2020 
Businesses have shuttered. People have 
stayed home to help us stem the spread 
of this virus. What we told them 
months ago is that, if you do this, we 
will be there. Our Federal Government 
will be there to work with you. We will 
help you. We will make sure you have 
money in your pocket so you can afford 
healthcare, so you can pay your bills, 
so you can pay your rent, you can pay 
for your food, so you do not have to 
have any economic insecurity. We 
made that commitment to them. We 
promised them. 
I have to say that we still have to 
follow that obligation. They are doing 
their part, so why aren’t we doing 
ours? 
At the end of the day, the President 
pro tempore and I both know, and all of 
our colleagues know, that there is 
more economic insecurity in this coun-
try right now than we have ever seen 
before because of this pandemic: food 
insecurity, housing insecurity, job in-
security, education insecurity. There is 
a homework gap. We know it. It is hap-
pening. So now it is time for us to stop 
the posturing, stop the political games-
manship and really do what we com-
mitted when we swore an oath to this 
office when we were sworn in, that we 
were going to do right by people across 
this country, looking out for their in-
terests—not our interests but the best 
interests of this country. 
So I come to the floor today to really 
ask my colleagues: Let’s try and do 
what is right for the best interests of 
this country, now more than ever. 
I know you get them. I get letters. I 
have letters from constituents right 
now—I can’t tell you—and I have been 
inundated with them. 
A constituent from Nevada wrote: 
I urge you to extend the federal eviction 
moratorium and include at least $100 billion 
in funding for emergency rental assistance in 
the next . . . relief [package]. [This] assist-
ance will enable households, including those 
who have lost jobs or who already were 
struggling to pay rent before the pandemic, 
to remain stably housed and avoid the dev-
astating and long-lasting harms of eviction. 
That is from a constituent. I didn’t 
write that. They sent it to my office. 
In this letter, this constituent from 
Nevada goes on to say: 
It is important to be kind and compas-
sionate. Especially during this time. We 
have the opportunity to learn and to do bet-
ter always. No one should be forced out of 
their home during a global pandemic. 
Those are similar to other letters I 
receive. I know you receive them. I 
know our colleagues receive them. 
That is why, today, it is important for 
us to focus on so much that is hap-
pening, including that economic secu-
rity. Right now I want to focus on one 
piece of it that we need to address that 
should be part of a global piece, which 
is this idea that, right now, millions of 
Americans are concerned about being 
evicted from their homes. 
In the middle of a pandemic, when 
people need a safe place to call home, 
they are concerned that they don’t 
have the money to pay their rent be-
cause we have asked them to stay 
home. 
I have said this before on the floor of 
the Senate. I will say it again. In the 
middle of a pandemic, housing is 
healthcare. Security in your own home 
is healthcare. Yet we have millions of 
people across the country on the brink 
of eviction. 
In mid-July, a quarter of adults re-
ported that they were housing inse-
cure. That is one in four. In more than 
half of the States in America, eviction 
bans have expired. That means, across 
the Nation, more and more families 
will have to pack up everything that 
they can carry in the space of hours. 
There could be 40 million evictions 
nationwide by the end of the year, and 
what we have seen amongst the data 
that comes in to all of our offices is 
that families of color are likely to be 
the hardest hit. In my home State of 
Nevada, experts believe that nearly 
half a million people are at risk of 
eviction—perhaps as many as 300,000 of 
them in Nevada by September. Among 
renters, up to 47 percent face that risk. 
Staving off Nevada evictions could 
cost Nevada $850 billion in rental as-
sistance over the next year. That is 
just one State. But do you know what? 
The States, the local governments, ev-
eryone has been impacted by this pan-
demic, and they are rightly looking to 
Congress to address it. They are des-
perate for us to pass meaningful legis-
lation to get them money to pay their 
bills, to enact protections that let 
them stay in their homes and apart-
ments. 
We need to help them now. We can’t 
turn our backs. We cannot turn our 
backs on Americans now, more than 
ever. They need our help. And we need 
the administration, we need leader-
ship—Republican 
leadership—coming 
to the negotiating table to get real re-
lief passed, not hollow political ges-
tures. 
We need a package that will include 
housing and rental assistance, prevent 
an epidemic of homelessness, and sta-
bilize the housing markets because, if 
we don’t, the consequences are going to 
haunt families and our economy for 
years. 
Now, I know this. Take it from me. 
In Nevada, we saw 200,000 families lose 
their homes because of the 2008 housing 
crisis. That foreclosure crisis hit Ne-
vada so hard, and it has been a long, 
long road back for so many Nevadans. 
I am determined not to ever see that 
happen again and to bring relief. If I 
am in a position—as we all are here in 
Congress—to bring that relief, why 
aren’t we in a room negotiating it? 
Why are we not talking regularly? We 
did it with the CARES Act imme-
diately. We saw the need, and we did 
something about it. 
Nevadans are already struggling to 
find work, to afford food, and to stay 
healthy during this pandemic; plus, 
they are helping their children learn as 
schools start to reopen. They cannot 
effectively do that—none of it—with-
out a safe place to stay, a roof over 
their head. 
Housing is the key to any sense of 
stability in our chaotic world right 
now. It is time to end the political 
games. Americans expect it. They need 
a roof over their head. That is why it is 
so vital we pass legislation, not just to 
help Nevadans but people all over the 
country pay their rent and utility bills 
when they cannot safely go to work be-
cause of this health pandemic. 
We already have legislation that is 
out there. We know it. The House, 
months ago, passed the Heroes Act, 
which addresses this issue. Our col-
leagues have introduced legislation— 
Senator BROWN’s Emergency Rental 
Assistance and Rental Market Sta-
bilization Act is out there—that can do 
the job. We can talk about how we 
bring this bill forward that helps so 
many families. 
It is not just rental stabilization but 
to help families keep a roof over their 
head. Remember, there are a lot of 
small businesses that are landlords. 
There are many businesses that are 
landlords who are shouldering the 
missed opportunities, and they are 
struggling. Landlords have bills to pay 
as well. They have mortgages; they 
have taxes; they have insurance, staff— 
let alone their families whom they 
have to take care of. Without assist-
ance, many of them will go bankrupt 
or can be forced to sell their properties. 
So let’s focus on the essentials, the 
basic need for things like shelter. Let’s 
keep people safe and off the streets. 
Let’s pass Senator BROWN’s rental as-
sistance bill. Senator REED has a hous-
ing assistance fund bill to help home-
owners 
avoid 
foreclosure. 
Senator 
MENENDEZ
has a housing counseling 
bill. There are so many others. They 
are in front of us. 
We have an opportunity to do the 
right thing here. The Senate just needs 
to do its part by making sure those 
homes are safe and stable, by passing 
legislation that is going to have a posi-
tive impact on so many Americans 
across this country. 
I thank the Presiding Officer for lis-
tening. I thank my colleagues for at 
least having the ability and the will to 
try to do something through the legis-
lation that was introduced, but now 
more needs to be done. We can’t just 
introduce legislation. Now is the time 
to do our jobs as Senators: to come to 
the floor of the Senate, bring legisla-
tion to the floor, and debate it. Let the 
American public actually see us work 
and do our jobs that we promised them 
we would be doing. 
It is OK to debate legislation. It is 
OK to compromise and come forth with 
good government and good policy that 
is going to lift all of us up. That is 
what the Senate should be doing, and 
that is what I look forward to from my 
colleagues. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

August 11, 2020 
IOWA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yes-
terday many parts of my home State of 
Iowa were hit by extreme winds and se-
vere 
storms—90-mile-an-hour 
winds, 
probably along the path along Inter-
state 80 from the Missouri River to the 
Mississippi River. Trees are uprooted, 
roadways are obstructed, crops are se-
verely damaged, grain bins are busted, 
outbuildings lost, some homes hurt, 
and over 400,000 households lost power. 
Just like any other natural disaster 
Iowa has experienced, I know that 
Iowans are going to band together and 
support each other as we recover from 
this storm. Senator ERNST and I stand 
ready to help with any Federal assist-
ance Iowa may need, and I hope that 
you will not hesitate to contact our re-
spective offices—both in Washington, 
DC, and in Iowa—if you need us. 
For sure, if Governor Reynolds de-
clares this as a disaster area, Senator 
ERNST and I will be quick to advise the 
President to follow the recommenda-
tions and requests of Governor Rey-
nolds. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petition or memorial 
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as 
indicated: 
POM–232. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Nevada urging 
the United States Congress and the Presi-
dent of the United States to provide flexible 
funding for state, local, and tribal govern-
ments to account for anticipated public 
budget shortfalls as a result of the COVID–19 
pandemic; to the Committee on Finance. 
ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 1 
Whereas, The rapid spread of the novel 
coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as 
COVID–19, was declared a pandemic by the 
World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, 
and a national emergency by President Don-
ald J. Trump on March 13, 2020; and 
Whereas, State, local and tribal govern-
ments have been on the front lines of the re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic, taking de-
cisive and dramatic actions, including order-
ing the closure of nonessential businesses 
and issuing stay-at-home orders, in an effort 
to comply with guidance from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention of the 
United States Department of Health and 
Human Services and protect the health and 
welfare of their citizens; and 
Whereas, As the result of these momentous 
actions to combat the COVID–19 pandemic, 
state, local and tribal governments, many of 
which were flourishing economically before 
the outbreak of COVID–19, now face eco-
nomic and fiscal crises of unprecedented pro-
portions; and 
Whereas, The Honorable Steve Sisolak, 
Governor of the State of Nevada, rapidly 
took action to combat the COVID–19 pan-
demic in the State of Nevada, issuing a se-
ries of Emergency Directives which, among 
other things, directed Nevadans to stay at 
home and provided for the closure of schools, 
casinos and gaming establishments and non-
essential businesses; and 
Whereas, The unemployment rate in the 
State of Nevada, which stood at a histori-
cally low 3.6 percent in February 2020, in-
creased in just two months to 30.1 percent in 
April 2020, which is the highest level ever re-
ported by a state in modern history; and 
Whereas, The State of Nevada’s General 
Fund now faces an estimated shortfall of ap-
proximately $1.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2020– 
2021; and 
Whereas, The State of Nevada and local 
and tribal governments in this State will be 
forced, just as other state, local and tribal 
governments in similar positions will be 
forced, to implement deep cuts in services 
and programs, many of which affect persons 
most impacted by the COVID–19 pandemic, 
unless federal relief is granted; now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the 
State of Nevada, Jointly, That the members of 
the 31st Special Session of the Nevada Legis-
lature hereby urge President Donald J. 
Trump and the Congress of the United States 
of America to provide further flexible fund-
ing for state, local and tribal governments to 
assist with anticipated public budget short-
falls as a result of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the As-
sembly prepare and transmit a copy of this

CELEBRATING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
FORMER CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
DONNALD K. ANDERSON 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a tireless public servant, whose 35 
years of service to the House of Representa-
tives have left an indelible legacy for the Peo-
ple’s House: Former Clerk of the House 
Donnald K. Anderson. 
Donnald Anderson’s House career began in 
1960, when he left home in Sacramento, Cali-
fornia to spend his senior year of high school 
as a House Page. This transformative experi-
ence changed the course of his life, which he 
would dedicate to serving the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
As a Page assigned to a post in the Demo-
cratic Cloakroom, Anderson had a front row 
seat to the workings of Congress. Following a 
brief conversation with Clerk of the House 
Ralph R. Roberts while making a delivery to 
his office one day, Anderson decided that 
‘‘being Clerk of the House has to be the best 
job in the world, and my fantasy as a 17-year- 
old high school senior was to be the Clerk of 
the House—little knowing that 27 years later I 
actually would become the Clerk of the 
House.’’ 
Following his time in the House Page initia-
tive, Anderson attended Sacramento State 
University and George Washington University, 
and spent eight years proudly serving his na-
tion in the U.S. Army Reserve. While pursuing 
his Bachelor’s degree in political science, An-
derson continued to work for the House, start-
ing as an elevator operator in 1961. The expe-
rience he gained and relationships he cul-
tivated led him to a position in the office of 
Congressman Jimmy Morrison of Louisiana, 
then to a position as an enrolling clerk and, in 
1969, he returned to the Democratic Cloak-
room as a second managerial assistant. 
Anderson became an expert on procedure 
and scheduling, establishing a reputation as a 
sought-after resource for Members looking to 
navigate the complexities of the House Floor. 
In 1972, Speaker Carl Albert of Oklahoma ap-
pointed Anderson Majority Floor Manager, a 
position he held for 15 years. And on January 
6, 1987, Anderson’s lifelong dream became 
realized when he was sworn in as the Clerk of 
the House for the 100th Congress, a position 
he held for eight years until retiring in 1995. 
In all his positions, Anderson served with in-
tegrity and dedication, taking immense pride in 
placing the duties of his office before partisan-
ship or political ideology, which became a cor-
nerstone of his tenure as Clerk. As Anderson 
noted, he was committed to ‘‘ensuring that my 
office was absolutely nonpartisan, that we 
treated all Members with the same courtesy, 
the same expediency, the same confidentiality, 
so that Members of the minority . . . could 
unburden themselves with me, even though I 
was a Democrat, knowing that I would never 
break their confidence.’’ 
As Clerk, he was instrumental in the forma-
tion of the House Office of Employee Assist-
ance and the Office of Fair Employment Prac-
tices, which continue to serve as vital tools for 
all House employees to receive the support 
and resources they need to effectively do their 
work on behalf of the American people. He 
also generously shared his deep knowledge of 
the legislative process and House protocol 
with new Members during Freshman orienta-
tion. 
One of Clerk Anderson’s most lasting im-
pacts on the House was his commitment to 
modernize the House. In the era before 
cellphones, Clerk Anderson’s campaign to in-
troduce electronic beepers was a great suc-
cess, and he constantly sought new tools to 
ensure Members were kept up-to-date on 
House proceedings. By harnessing new tech-
nologies, Anderson helped the House set the 
foundation for doing business in the informa-
tion age and in a world increasingly reliant on 
technological innovation. 
Clerk Anderson’s love for the House and 
dedication to the institution stands as an en-
during example for all those who will follow in 
his footsteps to serve the Congress and the 
American people. 
May it be a comfort to his friends, loved 
ones and the entire Anderson family that so 
many mourn their loss and are praying for 
them at this sad time.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF LEON 
FLEISHER 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with 
my 
colleague, 
Congressman 
ADAM 
SCHIFF, to honor a musical virtuoso, whose 
nearly 80-year-long career was marked by ex-
traordinary triumphs, profound struggles and 
inspiring perseverance: the incomparable Leon 
Fleisher. 
Born in San Francisco in 1928 to Jewish im-
migrant parents, Leon’s life embodied the 
American Dream. At the age of four, he began 
listening to his brother’s piano lessons before 
sneaking in afterwards to play everything he 
had heard by ear. It soon became clear that 
young Leon Fleisher was a piano prodigy. At 
age eight, he gave his first recital. At nine, he 
began training with the world-famous pianist 
Artur Schnabel. By sixteen, Fleisher was mak-
ing his debut at Carnegie Hall. At 23, Fleisher 
became the first American to win the Queen 
Elisabeth Piano Competition in Brussels and 
at 25, he released his first studio album. 
Leon Fleisher’s career was meteoric, vault-
ing him to the top of the classical music world 
and making him a sought-after soloist for 
some of the world’s most prestigious orches-
tras. Music critics of the time described 
Fleisher as ‘‘transcendent,’’ and that he had 
‘‘this kind of Apollonian perfection . . . When 
you hear something that he’s playing, you 
think that is the way it needs to be played.’’ 
But Fleisher’s true greatness became clear 
when, at the age of 36, he received the cata-
strophic diagnosis of Focal Dystonia, which 
lost him the use of his right hand. While he 
faced many years of failed treatments and de-
pression, he never lost hope. Instead, he 
found strength in the healing power of music. 
Harnessing his extraordinary talents, he con-
tinued the work he loved, becoming a master 
of the left hand repertoire; passing on his 
knowledge and expertise to younger genera-
tions of musicians as a teacher at The Pea-
body Institute in Baltimore, Maryland; and 
forming the acclaimed Theater Chamber Play-
ers, now based at the Kennedy Center in 
Washington, D.C. He also served as Artistic 
Director of the Tanglewood Music Center, 
Resident Conductor of the Baltimore Sym-
phony Orchestra and Music Director of the An-
napolis Symphony Orchestra. 
In 1995, more than three decades after his 
initial diagnosis, Fleisher found a course of 
treatment that allowed him to slowly regain 
use of his right hand that had eluded him for 
so long. In reflecting on his years of struggle, 
Fleisher noted, ‘‘There are forces out there, 
and if you keep yourself open to them, if you 
go along with them, there are wondrous sur-
prises.’’ 
Fleisher received many awards and acco-
lades over the years, including being named a 
Commander in the Order of Arts and Letters 
by the Minister of Culture of the French gov-
ernment and a 2007 Kennedy Center Honor— 
fitting tributes to a remarkable career. 
Fleisher’s musical brilliance and visionary 
career strengthened and enriched the artistic 
fabric of our nation. He leaves a profound leg-
acy for his countless students who follow in 
his footsteps and for the millions of music 
lovers around the world who he moved, in-
spired and entertained. 
May it be a comfort to his wife, Katherine, 
his children, Deborah, Leah, Richard, Paula 
and Julian, and the entire Fleisher family that 
so many mourn their loss and are praying for 
them at this sad time.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT

COLUMBIA 
SPECIAL 
ELEC-
TIONS HOME RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Special Elec-
tions Home Rule Act. This bill would give the 
District of Columbia complete authority to set 
the date of special elections for local offices, 
as other jurisdictions already have. Our bill 
simply removes a Home Rule Act limitation on 
the District that is not only inconsistent with

the self-government granted by the Home 
Rule Act, but is also counterproductive. 
This bill follows legislation we got through 
Congress in 2012 that gave the D.C. Board of 
Elections (‘‘Board’’) more flexibility to set the 
date of special elections for local offices to 
maximize voter participation. Although we 
sought complete authority for the District over 
the scheduling of special elections, the 2012 
law, the District of Columbia Special Election 
Reform Act, did not include this home-rule 
principle. D.C. should have complete authority 
over a matter that is unrelated to any other 
congressional district and has no relevance to 
Congress. 
The Home Rule Act originally required the 
Board to hold special elections on the first 
Tuesday 114 days from when the vacancy oc-
curred and allowed the Board to schedule 
special elections on the same day as the next 
general election if that election occurred 60 
days from when a special election would oth-
erwise have been held. This inflexibility led to 
special elections being held on religious holi-
days and forced the District to hold a special 
election separate from an upcoming general 
election, costing the District hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in extra election costs. The 
2012 law required the Board to hold a special 
election on a Tuesday occurring between 70 
and 174 days after the vacancy. 
Our bill is an important step to perfect home 
rule for the District. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill.

IN 
REMEMBRANCE 
OF 
THE 
FELICIAN 
SISTERS 
LOST 
TO 
CORONAVIRUS 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to memorialize the beautiful lives of thir-
teen nuns taken from our community by the 
scourge of coronavirus between April and 
June of this year. 
We honor the memory of Sister Mary Luiza 
Wawrzyniak, Sister Celine Marie Lesinski, Sis-
ter Mary Estelle Prints, Sister Thomas Marie 
Wadowski, Sister Mary Patricia Pyszynski, 
Sister Mary Clarence (Adeline) Borkoski, Sis-
ter Rose Mary Wolak, Sister Mary Janice 
(Margaret) Zolkowski, Sister Mary Alice Ann 
(Fernanda) Gradowski, Sister Victoria Marie 
Indyk, Sister Mary Martinez (Virginia) Rozek, 
Sister Mary Madeleine (Frances) Dolan, and 
Sister Mary Danatha (Lottie) Suchyta. 
These righteous women spent their days 
working and living together as members of the 
Felician Sisters at the Presentation of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary convent in Livonia, Michi-
gan—some for more than a half century. At 
the time of their deaths, they ranged in age 
from 69 to 99, still wholly committed to serving 
the most vulnerable among us. 
Prior to the pandemic, the sisters could be 
found working in our local schools, libraries, 
and medical facilities, providing enrichment to 
our students and care to our sick. Many of 
them pursued degrees in higher education 
during their lifetimes, always seeking new 
ways to instill a sense of peace, justice, dig-
nity, and truth in the world around them. My 
heart aches for the harm done to the soul of 
our community. 
This distinguished group has been respon-
sible for the founding of multiple schools and 
care centers in Michigan’s 11th District, includ-
ing Madonna University, which has become 
one of the nation’s largest Franciscan univer-
sities with a student body of approximately 
3,000 students. We, in Michigan’s 11th Dis-
trict, are forever indebted to them for their mis-
sion and impact. We grieve for the virtuous 
lives lost, and we hold their extended commu-
nity in our prayers. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in reflecting on the indelible mark left by 
these sisters on our community. May the 
grieving find comfort in the extraordinary leg-
acies of faith and service they leave.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JAMES 
CHARLES EVERS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of James 
Charles Evers, who passed away on Wednes-
day, July 22, in Brandon, Mississippi, at age 
97. 
Charles Evers was born in Decatur, Mis-
sissippi, on September 11, 1922. He served in 
the Army in World War II and later Korea, 
however, his biggest fight was the fight 
against racism. Following in his brother’s foot-
steps, civil rights activist Medgar Evers, 
Charles was a leader in the civil rights move-
ment. His early exposure to racial violence 
fueled his passion for driving out racism in a 
Jim Crow Mississippi. He wrote an autobiog-
raphy, ran a hotel, restaurant, cab stand, and 
funeral parlor, and would also become one of 
the first black radio disc jockeys of the state. 
In the 1960s, Charles became the mayor of 
a mixed-raced town for 16 years, and he 
played a crucial role in black voter registration 
in Mississippi as well as the desegregation of 
a hospital. 
His accomplishments and dedication to the 
black community would make Charles an in-
spiration to other aspiring black political lead-
ers. When Charles decided to run for mayor in 
Fayette, more than 175 black men ran for of-
fice across the state. Charles’s determination 
and refusal to quit would not go unnoticed, as 
he continued to fight for positions in higher of-
fices and continued to inspire everyone he en-
countered. 
Charles’ legacy was and always will be an 
inspiration to all of us. He was the epitome of 
a leader, and his impact on the civil rights 
movement made history. His life demonstrated 
one of service, grace, and love for his family 
and community. 
Left to cherish his memory are his ten chil-
dren, three sisters, two brothers, as well as 
many other friends and extended family mem-
bers.

IN MEMORY OF CURTIS JACOBSON 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the memory of the late Curtis Jacobson, 
a long-time resident of Detroit and Michigan’s 
13th Congressional District. 
I first got to know Mr. Jacobson when I 
served as a legislator in Michigan’s State 
House of Representatives. He was engaged 
and well-informed on a number of topics, 
ranging from current events to public policy to 
everyday issues facing residents of Michigan. 
Mr. Jacobson never shied away from sharing 
his opinion. My staff and I always appreciated 
a call from Mr. Jacobson. It was a delight to 
hear from him shortly after beginning my first 
term as U.S. Representative for Michigan’s 
13th District, and to continue to keep in touch 
with him. 
Throughout his life, Mr. Jacobson had a 
passionate interest in politics. He sought out 
knowledge and thought critically about issues. 
He took pride in his military service, having 
risen in the ranks to serve as Captain in the 
U.S. Army. In addition, Mr. Jacobson worked 
as a substitute teacher before settling into a 
career as an accountant with the City of De-
troit. He retired at the age of eighty. In addi-
tion to his work, Mr. Jacobson enjoyed playing 
bridge and spending time with his family. He 
is survived by his four children, Mary, Charles, 
Russel, and Marjorie; his eight grandchildren, 
and two great-grandchildren. 
It was an honor to know Curtis Jacobson. 
Please join me in his recognition.

CONGRATULATING BOULDER CITY 
MANAGER JANE BRAUTIGAM ON 
HER RETIREMENT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I wish 
to recognize and honor the work of an unsung 
hero. While elected officials across the country 
receive praise and notoriety for their position, 
it is often those behind the scenes that truly 
toil to execute the work needed to keep our 
great country going. This has never been truer 
than in the City of Boulder, in Colorado’s Sec-
ond Congressional District, which I have the 
honor to represent. Nowhere has a City Man-
ager made more of an impact on her commu-
nity than Jane Brautigam made on hers—on 
mine. This month, Jane announced her retire-
ment, an announcement that cannot go unrec-
ognized. 
Jane was the first female City Manager and 
the longest serving City Manager in Boulder’s 
history, a testament to her talent, fortitude, 
and commitment to public service. Among her 
many accomplishments, Jane guided Boulder 
through the 2013 floods, the most devastating 
rain and flood event in modern Colorado his-
tory. Earlier this year, Jane was honored by 
the Colorado City and County Manager’s As-
sociation as City Manager of the Year. Today, 
Jane remains pivotal in the necessary re-
sponse to the urgent crisis of COVID–19 and 
its unprecedented impacts on our community. 
Prior to serving in Boulder, Jane worked as 
the City Attorney, then as the City Manager, of 
Loveland, CO, also in my district. In her many 
leadership roles, Jane strove to empower her 
staff and to lead by example. Above all, Jane 
was committed to social, economic, and racial 
justice. 
I am grateful that Jane plans to continue 
supporting the development of strong city

IN RECOGNITION OF THE KIWANIS 
CLUB OF ANNISTON 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize 
The Kiwanis Club of Anniston Alabama’s 
100th Anniversary. 
The first Kiwanis club started its service in 
Detroit, Michigan, USA in 1915, and the 
Kiwanis Club of Anniston, Alabama became 
the 277th club in the USA and the 8th club in 
Alabama when it was formed on August 20, 
1920. Today it is one of 56 active clubs in Ala-
bama. 
The Kiwanis Club of Anniston lives up to its 
motto ‘‘Serving the Children of the World.’’ 
The club holds its annual Pancake Day fund-
raiser each March and currently raises more 
than $50,000 annually totaling $700,000 for 
children-related causes. The Kiwanis Club of 
Anniston has also been participating in cre-
ating and incubating the Sarrell Dental Clinic 
which remains a vibrant part of the community 
by serving children in need of dental services, 
the Kiwanis Walking Trail at LaGarde Park, 
and by contributing to the IDD (Iodine Defi-
ciency Disorder) and ELIMINATE (UNICEF 
Neo Natal Eliminate Tetanus) international 
programs which have had a major impact on 
the world. 
The Kiwanis Club of Anniston sponsors and 
supports the activities of eleven Key Clubs in 
Calhoun County in the following high schools: 
Alexandria, Anniston, Donoho, Faith Christian, 
Jacksonville, Ohatchee, Oxford, Pleasant Val-
ley, Weaver, Wellborn, and White Plains, a 
Builder’s Club, and Circle K at Jacksonville 
State University. 
The service provided by the Kiwanis Club of 
Anniston, Alabama over the past 100 years 
will continue to have a positive impact on the 
community and citizens as it celebrates its 
100th Anniversary and prepares the club for 
the changes and challenges that lie ahead. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the Kiwanis Club of Anniston for its 
service to our youth and community and 
thanking them for 100 years of service.

HONORING BARRY STERLING 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise with 
my colleague Congressman MIKE THOMPSON 
today in memory of Barry Sterling who passed 
away on July 26, 2020 at the age of 90 after 
a lifetime of exemplary service to his commu-
nity and the California winemaking industry. 
Mr. Sterling was born in Los Angeles on Oc-
tober 25, 1929. He spent his formative years 
living in Southern California before moving to 
Northern California to attend Stanford Univer-
sity, where his law school classmates included 
future 
Supreme 
Court 
Justices 
William 
Rehnquist and Sandra Day O’Connor. Impor-
tantly, Mr. Sterling also met Audrey Shapiro at 
Stanford. The two were married in 1952, and 
this month would have marked their 68th wed-
ding anniversary. 
Following law school, the Sterlings moved to 
Washington, D.C., where Mr. Sterling served 
in the Judge Advocate General Corps and 
they welcomed their daughter, Joy. Upon mov-
ing back to Los Angeles, Mr. Sterling opened 
his own corporate law firm and the Sterlings 
soon welcomed a son, Laurence. The family 
moved to France in 1967 where their dream of 
living on a vineyard was cultivated. Towards 
this end, they returned to California and found-
ed Iron Horse Vineyard. Many were skeptical 
of this purchase given the colder climate and 
the prevailing theory that chardonnay and 
pinot noir grapes would not thrive in western 
Sonoma. Undaunted, the Sterlings opened 
their winery in 1979, with the first of their spar-
kling wines released in 1980. 
In 1983, the Sterlings helped to establish a 
federal designation for their distinctive wine 
area, known as the Green Valley American 
Viticultural Area. Only a few years later, Iron 
Horse was served during the Geneva summit 
meetings between President Ronald Reagan 
and Soviet General Mikhail Gorbachev, ending 
the Cold War. Since then, Iron Horse has 
been consistently served at White House din-
ners. Iron Horse also produces wines to sup-
port charitable causes including a cuvee for 
ocean conservation in partnership with Na-
tional Geographic and a vintage Brut that ben-
efited the Redwood Empire Food Bank, which 
is the largest hunger-relief organization serv-
ing the north coast of California. In addition to 
winemaking, Mr. and Mrs. Sterling were found-
ing members of the Los Angeles Music Center 
and the Los Angeles Art Museum. Mr. Sterling 
was on the board of the San Francisco Sym-
phony, a Lifetime Trustee of the Leakey foun-
dation, and he was actively engaged in Demo-
cratic politics. In 2005, Mr. Sterling semi-re-
tired from running the business of Iron Horse 
but he remained involved in its operations until 
he passed away. 
Mr. Sterling is survived by his wife, Audrey; 
children Joy, Laurence and his wife Terry; 
grandchildren Justine, Mike, Barrie, and Jo-
seph; and great-grandson Calvin. 
Madam Speaker, please join Rep. THOMP-
SON and me in extending our appreciation for 
Mr. Sterling’s many accomplishments and re-
laying our deep condolences to his family, 
friends, and colleagues. His was a life well 
lived, and while he will be missed by many, 
Mr. Sterling’s legacy will live on through the in-
delible positive impact he had on his family, 
friends, and the extended winemaking indus-
try.

Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise

New Jersey resident Kenneth H. Garbowski. 
My 
friend, 
and 
the 
late 
Kenneth 
H. 
Garbowski was a lifelong resident of Glendora, 
New Jersey where he and his family lived. For 
30 years Ken worked for the Northeast Re-
gional Council of Carpenters as a council rep-
resentative. Ken was politically active in New 
Jersey through his position as a council rep-
resentative. 
Ken also was a member of the Gloucester 
Township Municipal Utilities Authority. He later 
served as a councilman in Gloucester Town-
ship. 
Ken was a kind, loving, and supportive hus-
band and father. When he was not serving his 
township, Ken loved to golf and was an avid 
coin collector but most of all he enjoyed 
spending time with his family. 
Ken was the beloved husband of Sherri, the 
devoted father of Samantha and Eric, and the 
loving brother of Edward, Dennis, and Ronald. 
Ken also had many loving nephews and one 
niece. He is predeceased by his parents Ed-
ward and Theresa. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring the life and legacy of my friend Ken-
neth H. Garbowski, of Glendora, New Jersey, 
for his tireless service to his township and 
peers.

IN HONOR OF PEARL BARDEN 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
celebration of ninety years of life of Ms. Pearl 
Barden, a resident of Inkster, Michigan for 
more than sixty-five years. 
Born and raised in Tarversville, Georgia, 
Ms. Barden moved to Inkster, Michigan at the 
age of fourteen. She is a proud graduate of 
Inkster Public Schools. In Michigan, Ms. 
Barden met and married the love of her life, 
Milton Barden, Jr., and was a devoted wife for 
more than fifty years. Together they nurtured 
and raised twelve children, emphasizing the 
value of education. Pearl Barden set a strong 
example for her family and community in the 
kindness she showed toward others, a trait 
she encouraged in her children. 
Ms. Barden’s children all attended Inkster 
Public Schools and went on to attend college 
or trade school. She has always been proud 
of their many accomplishments. Ms. Barden 
enjoys spending time with her family and 
counts twenty grandchildren, thirty-nine great 
grandchildren, and one great, great grandchild 
as the great blessings in her life. She fre-
quently takes on the role of caregiver to her 
extended family by providing a meal, or a ride 
to school, always with love and kindness. 
In addition to her active family life, Ms. 
Barden remains active in her community. A 
long-time member of Amity Baptist Church, 
she serves on the Usher Board and Mis-
sionary Board. She has formerly been recog-
nized by the Inkster community as ‘‘Woman of 
the Year’’ and ‘‘Mother of the Year.’’ Ms. 
Barden’s interests include a passion for read-
ing, bowling, sweet potato pie, and travel as 
demonstrated through her extensive travel 
across the United States with her children and 
friends. She has visited twenty-five of the fifty 
United States and enjoys vacationing in the 
Bahamas and Mexico.

CELEBRATING ALFRED 
BURGREEN’S 101ST BIRTHDAY 
HON. MAX ROSE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam Speaker, I 
ask all of my colleagues to join me today in 
extending our best wishes for my constituent, 
Mr. Alfred Burgreen, for his 101st birthday. 
The son of European immigrants, Alfred was 
born in New York City on August 15, 1919. He 
lived through the Great Depression and went 
on to serve in the 82nd Airborne where he 
helped liberate Europe from the Nazis. 
After he was wounded during the invasion 
of Sicily, Mr. Burgreen returned home, married 
Shirley Feldman, and attended Columbia Uni-
versity under the G.I. bill. He continued to 
dedicate his life to civil service and to raising 
a family of three children, six grandchildren, 
and six great grandchildren. His children de-
scribe him as an inveterate letter writer and a 
gracious host who is always willing to reach 
out and offer a friendly ear or some words of 
wisdom—including the three most important 
lessons he passed on to his children: be em-
pathetic, get an education, and always root for 
the Mets. 
Now, for the past 40 years, Mr. Burgreen 
has lived in Brooklyn surrounded by his in-
credibly loving support system. He’s the oldest 
surviving member of the 82nd Airborne, a unit 
that he still continues to support to this day. 
Just a few years ago, a professor reached out 
to Mr. Burgreen asking for help writing his his-
tory of the 82nd Airborne. Not only did Alfred 
provide everything he’d kept from his days in 
the Army—photos, rosters, you name it—but 
he actually provided details about three sol-
diers who were listed as Missing in Action, de-
tails that might help the Army investigate and 
give closure to the families. 
This 
is 
just 
one 
example 
of 
Alfred 
Burgreen’s incredible compassion and ability 
to keep people connected. So once again, I 
ask all of my colleagues to join me today in 
thanking Mr. Alfred Burgreen for his service to 
our nation and in wishing this hero not just a 
happy 101st birthday, but many more to come.

HONORING THE FRONTLINE EM-
PLOYEES OF GLENS FALLS HOS-
PITAL FOR THEIR HEROIC WORK 
THROUGHOUT THE COVID–19 PAN-
DEMIC 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the frontline employees of 
Glens Falls Hospital for their heroic work 
throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Working in the healthcare industry comes 
with a number of risks, even in the best of 
times. The frontline healthcare workers at 
Glens Falls Hospital, who went to work each 
day throughout this pandemic, did so despite 
those risks to help their patients and the com-
munity. They have placed the health of strang-
ers before thoughts of themselves time and 
time again, sacrificing time spent with their 
own families to care for others. This pandemic 
is truly an unprecedented event and each of 
these frontline workers have risen to the chal-
lenge, meeting the situation with great cour-
age and tenacity. They deserve our utmost 
thanks and respect. 
Throughout these difficult months, ensuring 
that the hospital has the necessary funds and 
supplies to combat the pandemic has been of 
the utmost importance to me. The Glens Falls 
Hospital has received over $44 million in direct 
aid so that they can continue to serve the resi-
dents of the greater Glens Falls area, fully 
equipped to protect themselves and others. 
Their professionalism and expertise in han-
dling this crisis is a model for others. The 
number of Coronavirus patients has been rel-
atively low in the North Country, thanks in part 
to the quick response and extraordinary steps 
that hospital administration and staff have 
taken to limit the spread. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
district, I want to thank the frontline healthcare 
workers of Glens Falls Hospital for their cour-
age and professionalism throughout this crisis. 
The entire community is indebted to them and 
I will continue to advocate for them as their 
Representative in Congress.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
DEPUTY DYLAN PICKLE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Deputy 
Dylan Pickle, who passed away on Sunday, 
July 26, while conducting a safety checkpoint. 
Dylan was born on July 2, 1996, in Amory, 
Mississippi. At four years old, Dylan knew he 
wanted to wear a badge. After graduating from 
Amory High School, Dylan began to make that 
badge a reality. He pursued a degree in Crimi-
nal Justice at Itawamba Community College 
and joined the Army at only 17. 
Joining the Army was only the beginning for 
Dylan. He earned a medal at Quantico and 
would later receive three more for his heroism 
in Syria, where he served as a Specialist, be-
coming known for his leadership and his care 
for others. In 2016, Dylan brought his passion 
for serving home and began working with the 
Monroe County Sheriff’s Department as a pa-
trol deputy. 
Outside of his patrol duties, Dylan was a 
member of the First United Methodist Church. 
A momma’s boy, Dylan always made time for 
his family, especially his niece and nephews, 
whom he adored and spoiled whenever he 
could. Although serving his country was his 
passion, he also enjoyed going to the shooting 
range, collecting guns, listening to country 
music, and of course, socializing with his 
friends. 
Deputy Dylan Pickle’s life was one of serv-
ice, grace, and love for his family and commu-
nity. He will be greatly missed by all whom he

HONORING GERALDINE GONZALES- 
ROMERO 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, the country 
has lost a beloved community member in Den-
ver, a matriarch of the Chicano Movement. 
Geraldine 
Gonzales-Romero, 
known 
as 
Jerry, was born in Brighton, Colorado in 1931, 
and married Rudolfo Corky Gonzales in 1949. 
Jerry was part of the Romero family, one of 
the oldest families in the San Luis Valley, an 
area of Colorado from which my own wife’s 
family originates. Jerry and Corky had eight 
children, 19 grandchildren and 26 great grand-
children, many of whom have followed in the 
footsteps of Jerry and Corky with their own 
advocacy, activism, and public service. 
A true American hero, Jerry was a giant 
whose sacrifices and relentless pursuit of 
equality paved the road for so many of us who 
stand here now. Commemorations of her fam-
ily include the Rodolfo ‘‘Corky’’ Gonzales 
branch of Denver Public Library which opened 
2015. 
As a nation we once again find ourselves in 
a critical moment in the struggle for equity and 
justice, and it is people like Jerry Gonzales- 
Romero who inspire us with her life-long work 
on behalf of her community. 
I thank Ms. Gonzales-Romero for her en-
dearing spirit and example.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 
RETIREMENT OF DAVID FORD 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize 
the retirement of David Ford. 
David recently announced his retirement 
from Berman Museum of World History in An-
niston, Alabama, after serving as assistant di-
rector for the past 13 years. 
He is a 1970 graduate of Anniston High 
School and was a member of the last class to

graduate from the old high school on Leighton 
Avenue. He was drum major of the Anniston 
High School Marching Band. 
David is a graduate of Jacksonville State 
University where he served as editor of The 
Chanticleer. 
He also served in the United States Air 
Force as a pharmacy technician. 
Prior to his time at the museum, Ford 
worked to improve the situation at the Calhoun 
County Humane Society and before that spent 
his career working in journalism at WDNG 
radio station in Anniston writing and broad-
casting stories about the lives of people in 
Calhoun County. He was a Public Information 
Officer for the Calhoun County EMA and 
worked in civil service for several years as a 
technical writer for the Anniston Army Depot 
and as Press Secretary for former Alabama 
Governor Bob Riley. His professional life has 
been one dedicated to public service. 
When David left WDNG, the Anniston mayor 
and city council presented him with the Key to 
the City. 
David had a personal relationship with the 
Berman Museum chief benefactors, Farley 
and Germaine Berman, and that connection 
was evident in his work at the museum. He 
spent many of his days giving groups special 
tours of the facility and his natural ability of 
story-telling made the position the perfect fit. 
David won’t slow down much with retirement 
as he was just named president of the Annis-
ton Morning Rotary Club, a member of the An-
niston Runners Club, a volunteer at the Annis-
ton Soup Bowl and serves as senior warden 
at the Church of St. Michael and All Angels. 
At St. Michael’s, he is also a member of the 
Parish Choir, a Lay Eucharistic Minister and 
Docent, member of the Archives and History 
Committee. As Senior Warden, he also serves 
as a member of the Executive Committee, the 
Endowment Committee and the Board of Di-
rectors of St. Michael’s Medical Clinic. 
He has been active in the affairs of the 
Episcopal Diocese of Alabama, frequently rep-
resenting St. Michael and All Angels as a del-
egate to annual Diocesan conventions. He has 
served in nearly every leadership capacity 
possible at St. Michael and All Angels and is 
a graduate of the Education for Ministry pro-
gram of The Episcopal Church, a multiple-year 
intensive study for lay persons, under the aus-
pices of The University of the South. 
David is married to Jo Rhea and they have 
one son, John David. 
He is the son of Melvin and Doris Ford, of 
Oxford and has three siblings. 
He enjoys cooking and can be found around 
town wearing his signature bowtie and pocket 
square. As a lifelong lover of history and a vo-
racious reader, he plans to spend his new free 
time writing. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the career of my friend, David Ford, and 
wishing him the best in his retirement.

UTAH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE 
RECOGNITION ON JULY 31, 2020 
HON. BEN McADAMS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, local busi-
nesses are the engines that drive economic 
growth and jobs in Utah. The support Utah 
small businesses receive from local Chambers 
of Commerce is important in good times. Dur-
ing this pandemic, the 20 Chambers in Utah’s 
4th Congressional District have been a critical 
source for information and shared resources. 
Chamber leaders and Chamber members 
are integral to their customers and their com-
munities. They know each other’s history, 
challenges, wins, and losses. They share a 
common goal of serving the needs of hard- 
working Utah families and providing those 
families with an income, benefits and an eco-
nomic ladder to climb. 
During this COVID–19 crisis, these Cham-
bers have had to be innovative, and to find 
new platforms from which to communicate 
with their members. They’ve taken on the as-
signment of learning about business loans, re-
lief programs and unemployment information 
from local, state and federal agencies. Not 
only do they worry about their own businesses 
and family member, they’ve shouldered the re-
sponsibility of looking out for their membership 
as well. 
I would like to highlight and thank the Amer-
ican Fork Chamber, Chamber West, Holladay 
Chamber, Mount Pleasant Area Chamber, 
Murray Chamber, Nephi Chamber, Pacific Is-
lander Chamber, Salt Lake Chamber, South 
Jordan Chamber, South Salt Lake Chamber, 
South Valley Chamber, South West Valley 
Chamber, Utah Asian Chamber, Utah Black 
Chamber, Utah Hispanic Chamber, Utah Gay 
and Lesbian Chamber, West Jordan Chamber, 
Payson-Santaquin Chamber, Point of the 
Mountain Chamber, and the Utah Valley 
Chamber. 
Our fight against the coronavirus goes on. 
The economic recovery, when it happens, may 
be much slower than any of us want. We have 
never needed small business champions more 
than we do now. I thank the leaders of the 
Utah Chambers of Commerce for ensuring 
that the evolving needs of their members—our 
vital small businesses, employees and hard- 
working families—are met.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
WILLIAM K. NICHOLS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 11, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Deputy Wil-
liam Nichols, who passed away on Wednes-
day, July 22, after heroically rescuing his son 
from a rip current at Fort Walton Beach. 
William was born on January 15, 1987, in 
Clarksdale, Mississippi. He was a humble and 
kind man who always put others before him-
self. His passion for search and rescue began 
at a young age after watching his father over-
see the county’s search-and-rescue unit. His 
love for others, coupled with his selflessness, 
allowed him to follow in his father’s footsteps 
and pursue a career in search-and-rescue with 
DeSoto County. 
He began his career as a volunteer and 
would later serve as a senior officer and Ser-
geant with the sheriffs department. Like his fa-
ther, he was then promoted to director of the 
search-and-rescue unit and would oversee the 
unit for the following seven years. 
Outside of his passion for search-and-res-
cue, William was a faithful member of Corner-
stone Church and served as the Explorer Ad-
visor through the Boy Scouts of America. 
Other than holding numerous specialized cer-
tifications in his field, William also served as a 
NASCAR instructor and lead evaluator and 
was also an NRA instructor. 
William died a hero, and his heroism will not 
be forgotten as William’s last act of service 
was saving his son. His life was one of serv-
ice, grace, and love for his family and commu-
nity. He will be greatly missed by all whom he 
encountered. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Lind-
say Nichols; his daughter, Leah Langtson; and 
his son, William Nichols; as well as many 
other friends and extended family members.
