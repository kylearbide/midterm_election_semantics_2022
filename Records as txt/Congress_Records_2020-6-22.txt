DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Loving God, thank You for giving us 
another day. 
We beseech You to consider the con-
cerns and prayers of Your people as the 
coronavirus continues to spread in so 
many States in our Union. Bless those 
who are ill with recovery, and those 
who labor to find a medical solution to 
the pandemic. 
Bless us with Your love, for more 
love is needed now. Angry and volatile 
gatherings have given way to inten-
tional public expression for a change in 
police practice and culture. May re-
forms that come from the principles in 
conversation with one another benefit 
both police organizations and police-
men, and the communities which they 
serve. 
Bless our Congress with wisdom and 
good will, that far-reaching solutions 
might be found to engage the national 
government wherever that might be 
appropriate and necessary. 
Bless us all this day, and every day, 
and may all that we do be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God,

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JUNE 22, 2020 
No. 114 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Spirit, the source of our joy, 
we are grateful that You still speak to 
us. Continue to communicate with our 
lawmakers through the voice of con-
science. Enable them to maintain a 
clear conscience before You and hu-
manity. 
Continue to speak to our Senators 
through the precepts in Your sacred 
Word, providing them with a lamp for 
their feet and a light for their path as 
they navigate through this challenging 
season. Lord, continue to speak to 
them through the unfolding of Your 
powerful providence, opening doors 
You desire them to walk through and 
closing doors that lead them away 
from glorifying You. And, Lord, when 
You speak to our lawmakers, give 
them the wisdom to listen and obey. 
We pray in Your gracious Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
PRESIDENT’S EXECUTIVE ORDER 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
President Trump recently signed an 
Executive order requiring common-
sense administrative steps to promote 
police accountability. Democrats im-
mediately criticized it as weak and in-
sufficient to combat racial injustice, 
citing the need for changing laws. Of 
course, this is an Executive order. In 
itself, it does not and cannot solve the 
whole problem. 
This reminds me of when the Presi-
dent was criticized for not ordering a 
nationwide lockdown, despite having 
no such power, and then was accused of 
being a dictator for suggesting that he 
had a role in reopening the economy. 
The President deserves credit for 
taking steps within his authority to 
improve police accountability, but he 
cannot change the law. 
Congress must now work and do it in 
a bipartisan way to do what we can 
within the scope of our constitutional 
authority to make things better. 
You cannot legislate away racial in-
justice overnight, but Federal, State, 
and local laws must reflect our na-
tional creed that all people are created 
equal. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
while the House continues to be absent, 
the Senate continues to be open for 
business. While taking smart pre-
cautions, Senators have stood with all 
the other essential workers who are 
continuing to man essential posts. So 
as our Nation continues to work 
through medical, economic, and social 
challenges of historic proportions, the 
Senate has been able to lead on serious 
action to help our Nation heal. 
The killings of Black Americans, 
such as Breonna Taylor and George 
Floyd, have rightly accelerated the na-
tional conversation on policing and ra-
cial justice. Large majorities of Ameri-
cans support new steps that would help 
the vast majority of good, decent, and 
brave law enforcement officers re-earn 
the trust of Black Americans for their 
vital institutions. 
We need to be a country where com-
munities of color feel confident that 
the police are there to safeguard their 
rights to equal justice and equal pro-
tection under law and not to infringe 
on those rights. 
To that end, while the Constitution 
means many of the specifics of police 
reform are primarily State and local 
issues, there is an enormous appetite in 
the Senate to incentivize change and 
move toward greater progress using 
Federal policy. 
The junior Senator from South Caro-
lina has led the development of a 
strong new proposal. The JUSTICE Act 
is informed by data, by the facts, by 
stories 
from 
across 
America, 
and, 
sadly, by his own lived experience. It 
enjoys the support of 46 cosponsors al-
ready. 
The legislation Senator SCOTT has 
put forward identifies productive ways 
that 
Congress 
can 
encourage 
and 
incentivize smart police reform efforts 
in communities all across our country. 
Recognizing the urgent need for 
greater accountability, it supports ex-
panded use of body cameras and ex-
panded review and disciplinary meas-
ures to back them up. 
Recognizing the need for more trans-
parency, it steps up efforts to establish 
the records of police activities and re-
quires full Federal reporting of all inci-
dents involving the discharge of a serv-
ice weapon. 
The bill takes immediate action to 
help end departments’ reliance on 
choke holds and to facilitate enhanced 
training for deescalation. It includes 
further steps to protect the physical 
safety of people in custody and to fi-
nally—finally make lynching a Federal

crime. It lays out new requirements for 
departments to explain their policies 
on how, when, and why no-knock war-
rants are used. On behalf of the many 
people looking for answers in my 
hometown of Louisville, I am, unfortu-
nately, especially interested in that 
provision. 
In recent weeks, the Democratic 
leader and many of our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle have in-
sisted—insisted—over 
and 
over 
and 
over again that they wanted to con-
sider legislation on this subject prior 
to the Fourth of July. My friend the 
Democratic 
leader 
repeatedly 
ex-
pressed how eager—eager he was to 
consider these issues here on the Sen-
ate floor, but now we read this: ‘‘Sen-
ate Democrats are agonizing over what 
to do about Senate Republicans’ police 
reform proposal.’’ What is there to ago-
nize over? 
And we read this: ‘‘[The] Senate 
Democratic leader . . . faces a tough 
call on whether to let a Republican- 
backed police reform bill advance on 
the Senate floor.’’ 
‘‘Agonizing’’? ‘‘Tough call’’? It seems 
to me that proceeding to consider Sen-
ator SCOTT’s legislation, proceeding to 
take up the subject on the Senate 
floor, would only be an agonizing pros-
pect if Members were more interested 
in making a point than in actually 
making a law. 
For anyone who actually wants to 
legislate, it shouldn’t be a difficult call 
to vote to begin considering Senator 
SCOTT’s legislation. It will be exactly 
the vote which this moment demands. 
Last week, I understand the Speaker 
of the House herself said: ‘‘We’d like to 
end up in conference’’ on police reform 
legislation. The only way to do that 
would be if the Senate passed a bill. 
Even the Speaker does not seem to un-
derstand why Senate Democrats would 
block this Chamber from even consid-
ering the JUSTICE Act. 
Senator SCOTT
and Senate Repub-
licans are interested in making a law. 
The President and the administration 
want to make a law, and even the 
Democratic House leadership appar-
ently would be happy to see a con-
ference committee. So maybe the only 
group left in Washington who are re-
portedly agonizing over whether to 
block discussion of police reform or to 
let it proceed seem to be our Senate 
Democratic colleagues. 
I hope that whatever strange polit-
ical calculations are making this dif-
ficult for our friends across the aisle 
will yield to common sense and to the 
American people’s hunger for progress. 
We are going to find out when we vote 
later this week.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
American people are crying out for 
major, significant changes in policing 
in this country. Being killed by the po-
lice is now the sixth leading cause of 
death for young men in America. 
Young Black men are 2.5 times more 
likely than White men to be killed by 
police, while Black women are 1.4 
times more likely than White women 
to be killed by police. 
As hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans of all ages and colors take to the 
streets to demand change, we need leg-
islation that rises to the moment. So 
Democrats introduced a bill 3 weeks 
ago that would bring strong, com-
prehensive, and lasting change to po-
lice departments across America: the 
Justice in Policing Act. 
Our colleagues in the House are ex-
pected to pass that bill this week. How-
ever, here in the Senate, our Repub-
lican colleagues have responded to our 
comprehensive proposal with an ap-
proach that is piecemeal and half-
hearted. The longer you look at the Re-
publican policing reform effort, the 
more obvious are the shortcomings and 
deficiencies. 
The Republican bill does nothing— 
nothing to reform the legal standards 
that shield police from accountability 
for violating Americans’ constitutional 
rights. The Republican bill does noth-
ing—nothing to encourage independent 
investigations of police departments 
with patterns and practices that vio-
late the Constitution. The Republican 
bill does nothing—nothing to reform 
the use of force standard, nothing— 
nothing on qualified immunity, noth-
ing on racial profiling, and nothing on 
limiting the transfer of military equip-
ment to police departments. 
The Republican bill doesn’t even 
truly ban choke holds or no-knock war-
rants. It leaves major loopholes when 
it comes to choke holds and only re-
quires more data on no-knock war-
rants. More data would not have saved 
Breonna Taylor’s life. Allowing police 
to use choke holds whenever they say 
that deadly force is necessary is not 
going to save lives. 
We need a bill that achieves genuine 
police reform. The Republican proposal 
comes across like a list of suggestions. 
I would repeat this important warn-
ing: If we pass a bill that is ineffective 
and the killings continue and police de-
partments resist change and there is no 
accountability, the wound in our soci-
ety will not close; it will fester. This is 
not about making an effort or dipping 
our toes in the water. It must be about 
solving a problem that is taking the 
lives of too many Black Americans. 
This is not a time for studies or com-
missions or tinkering around the edges.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3115 
June 22, 2020 
This is not a debate about tax policy or 
transportation policy. It is a matter of 
the constitutional rights of the Amer-
ican people, and it is truly a matter of 
life and death. 
Unfortunately, Senator SCOTT’s bill 
is deeply and fundamentally flawed. It 
would not have prevented the death of 
George Floyd or Breonna Taylor or 
Ahmaud Arbery or Michael Brown or 
Eric Garner, and if it will not stop fu-
ture deaths of Black Americans in po-
lice custody, then it does not represent 
the change that is demanded right now. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, on COVID, over the 
past several weeks, there has been an 
alarming increase in the number of 
COVID–19 cases in a number of Amer-
ican States. Florida, Texas, Arizona, 
and North Carolina continue to report 
thousands of new cases each day. State 
officials in Texas and Arizona are 
warning about the dire number of hos-
pitalizations. Anyone looking at the 
facts would conclude that we need to 
figure out what is causing these in-
creases and put measures in place to 
limit this new spread of the disease. 
But President Trump does not look 
at the facts or try to understand them. 
Instead, the President is so consumed 
with his own ego, his own political in-
terests and perception of how he has 
handled this crisis, that he is actually 
downplaying the numbers and invent-
ing ridiculous excuses for why COVID– 
19 cases continue to increase. 
At his inadvisable and very poorly 
attended rally in Tulsa on Saturday, 
President Trump said that he told his 
administration to ‘‘slow the testing 
down, please,’’ so the number of COVID 
cases will not look so bad for him. It is 
amazing he said that. Don’t learn the 
truth about a serious and deadly dis-
ease so he might look better? 
He went on to say that testing was 
‘‘a double-edged sword.’’ Let me break 
the President’s statement down for a 
moment. By calling testing ‘‘a double- 
edged sword,’’ the President means 
that, on one hand, testing could be 
good because it, you know, tells us who 
has COVID–19, but, on the other hand, 
testing might not be so good because 
the more cases make the President 
look bad. Who thinks like that in a 
time of a raging pandemic? 
White House officials tried to claim 
the President was joking, but, today, 
the Vice President denied that they 
were just in jest, calling them ‘‘a pass-
ing 
observation,’’ 
whatever 
that 
means. 
Regardless of whether he was serious 
or not, the President’s comments are 
factually inaccurate. The increase in 
testing is not responsible for the in-
crease in the number of cases. In fact, 
the rate of positive cases is going up in 
many States, which means community 
spread. 
There is a lie sitting at the heart of 
all of this. President Trump wants 
Americans to believe that the number 
of cases is going up because his admin-
istration has done such a great job on 
testing. The truth is, the administra-
tion can’t even get around to spending 
the money Congress has provided for 
improving testing and tracing. 
Senator MURRAY and I sent a letter 
last week to HHS Secretary Azar, ask-
ing him why the administration hasn’t 
disbursed the $14 billion we gave it to 
ramp up testing and the tracing capa-
bility. This $14 billion is just sitting 
there, waiting for the Trump adminis-
tration to use it to help our country. 
Senator MURRAY and I are looking for 
answers. Why isn’t the money being 
distributed when it is desperately need-
ed? What the heck is going on? 
It is hard to imagine a more hap-
hazard, 
less-focused, 
and 
less-con-
sistent response from an administra-
tion during a national crisis. Whether 
it is calling COVID a hoax or pre-
scribing bleach or having his ego-driv-
en rally over the weekend, the Presi-
dent keeps reminding us that he 
doesn’t take the COVID pandemic seri-
ously enough. Ironically, the best thing 
about the President’s rally was that so 
few people attended. Otherwise, the 
risk of spreading COVID would have 
been significantly higher. 
U.S. ATTORNEY GEOFFREY BERMAN 
Mr. President, on another matter— 
there are so many matters and so much 
trouble this administration is in that 
it is hard to count, and you would prob-
ably need several hours to document 
and talk about them all—last Friday 
night, Attorney General Barr claimed 
that Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attor-
ney for the Southern District of New 
York, was ‘‘stepping down.’’ A short 
time later, Mr. Berman revealed that 
the Attorney General was lying and 
that he was not, in fact, stepping down. 
Over the past 2 days, this sordid, ham- 
handed plot by President Trump and 
Attorney General Barr to oust a well- 
respected U.S. attorney played out in 
public view. 
But for Mr. Berman’s principled 
stand, the White House and the DOJ 
would have subverted the chain of suc-
cession in the Southern District of New 
York to install a pliant U.S. attorney 
from New Jersey in Mr. Berman’s 
place. Thankfully, due to Mr. Berman’s 
courage, that plan was thwarted, and 
Mr. Berman’s deputy will take over the 
leadership of the Southern District and 
continue its important work. She has a 
fine reputation as a prosecutor and 
someone of integrity. People of integ-
rity don’t seem to be welcome in this 
administration. 
Then the DOJ announced that the 
President intended to nominate the sit-
ting SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, to re-
place Mr. Berman. As the Senator from 
New York, I will not return a blue slip 
on Mr. Clayton’s nomination. Regard-
less, Jay Clayton should withdraw his 
name from consideration and refuse to 
be an accomplice to this scheme. 
There appears to be no legitimate 
motive to fire Mr. Berman, which 
leaves the obvious question: Were 
President Trump and the Attorney 
General trying to remove him for a 
corrupt motive? Was it because Mr. 
Berman, in the Southern District of 
New York, was pursuing criminal in-
vestigations into President Trump and 
his associates? The President certainly 
has a pattern of firing government 
watchdogs who are investigating his 
misconduct or that of his associates. 
We need an immediate, top-to-bot-
tom investigation into what transpired 
with the plot to dismiss Mr. Berman. 
So I have demanded that the Office of 
Professional Responsibility at the De-
partment of Justice work with the Jus-
tice Department’s inspector general to 
determine whether there were corrupt 
motives for Mr. Berman’s dismissal 
and, if so, discipline the officials in-
volved no matter who they are or how 
high up they go. These two offices 
jointly investigated the firing of U.S. 
attorneys in 2006 during the Bush ad-
ministration and should do so again. 
The Committee on the Judiciary here 
in the Senate, led by Chairman GRA-
HAM, must also investigate what hap-
pened here, using its subpoena power, if 
necessary. Senator GRAHAM seems to 
be investigating President Obama and 
Vice President Biden with 53 sub-
poenas. He certainly must have time to 
investigate a serious problem that has 
come before us right now. After all, the 
abject refusal of Senate Republicans to 
hold President Trump accountable for 
his assault on the rule of law in the 
country is what has gotten us here in 
the first place. 
The Senate Republicans refused to 
stand up to the President when he fired 
the FBI Director for investigating his 
campaign. They refused to stand up to 
the President when he made a national 
emergency in order to steal funds for 
the border wall. They refused to stand 
up to the President when he dismissed 
not one or two or three but four inspec-
tors general. They also refused to stand 
up to the President when he tried to 
bully a foreign power into helping him 
in his reelection. 
Every time the President breaks a 
window, the Senate Republican major-
ity dutifully sweeps up the glass. Every 
blue moon or so, a Republican Senator 
will issue a mild rebuke of the Presi-
dent’s behavior or will pen a strongly 
worded letter, but the response is never 
commensurate with the offense. As a 
result, President Trump knows there is 
no line he can’t cross. He and his At-
torney General can fire a sitting U.S. 
attorney without cause, perhaps for in-
vestigating criminal wrongdoing by the 
President or his associates, and the 
Senate Republicans would hardly bat 
an eye. Will Senate Republican Sen-
ators ever say, ‘‘Enough’’? 
NOMINATION OF CORY T. WILSON 
Mr. President, finally, today, Leader 
MCCONNELL will move forward with the 
nomination of Mr. Cory Wilson to serve 
as a lifetime appointment on the Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Mr. Wilson is an avowed opponent of 
the Nation’s healthcare law, calling it 
illegitimate and perverse. Even worse, 
Wilson has a lengthy record of support

for policies that suppress voting rights 
in the State legislature, and in the 
Mississippi secretary of state’s office, 
he pushed for restrictive voter ID laws. 
He criticized the Voting Rights Act 
and peddled unproven claims about 
voter fraud. In 2011, he said the 
NAACP’s concerns about voter suppres-
sion in Mississippi were ‘‘poppycock.’’ 
We are in the middle of a national 
conversation about police reform and 
systematic 
racial 
justice. 
Leader 
MCCONNELL talks about it on the floor, 
and at the same time, he has the te-
merity to push a judge with dem-
onstrated hostility to voting rights, a 
man who criticized the greatest ad-
vance in civil rights legislation in the 
past century, for a seat on the circuit 
court, in which people of color make up 
55 percent of the population. 
The nomination is so appalling in 
general that, at this particular mo-
ment, several Democrats, myself in-
cluded, have taken the unusual step of 
writing Leader MCCONNELL today to re-
quest that he withdraw Mr. Wilson’s 
nomination. I believe, if there is sin-
cerity in the remarks here about heal-
ing racial wounds, then the withdrawal 
of Mr. Wilson will occur, plain and sim-
ple. It would be disgraceful for the Sen-
ate to approve a nominee who has long 
trivialized 
voter 
disenfranchisement 
and racial discrimination at the ballot 
box. Leader MCCONNELL
should halt 
any further work on Mr. Wilson and, 
instead, work with the administration 
and civil rights groups to find a nomi-
nee who will actually protect voting 
rights on the Fifth Circuit. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, ‘‘I hope 
I am over wary, but if I am not, there 
is, even now, something of ill omen 
amongst us. I mean the increasing dis-
regard for law which pervades the 
country, the growing disposition to 
substitute the wild and furious pas-
sions in lieu of the sober judgment of 
courts, and the worse than savage 
mobs for the executive ministers of 
justice. This disposition is awfully 
fearful in any community; and that it 
exists now in ours, though grating to 
our feelings to admit, it would be a vio-
lation of truth and an insult to our in-
telligence to deny. Accounts of out-
rages committed by mobs form the ev-
eryday news of the times.’’ 
Now, those are not my words. Those 
are the words of a young Abraham Lin-
coln. Sadly, they ring with truth 
today. 
In recent weeks, violent mobs have 
roamed our streets, defacing and tear-
ing down statues and monuments—in 
most cases, with neither resistance 
from the police nor legal consequences. 
On Friday, a mob tore down another 
statue just a few blocks from here. The 
police stood idly by and watched as ri-
oters toppled it and set it on fire. One 
can only assume they were ordered not 
to intervene by Washington’s leftwing 
mayor. 
Here is the thing: Steps were already 
underway to move that statue law-
fully. Washington’s delegates in Con-
gress had legislation to that effect. But 
mobs don’t care to negotiate—only to 
destroy. 
The delegate said: I have no doubt I 
could have gotten that bill through, 
but the people got here before due proc-
ess. 
It is hard to imagine a more chilling 
summation of mob rule. As Lincoln 
knew, the mob threatens not just old 
statues but the lives and livelihoods of 
us all. Indeed, the mob threatens civili-
zation itself in many ways. 
Most simply, Lincoln knew that 
mobs inevitably make mistakes and 
commit injustices. Some may celebrate 
the destruction of disfavored statues 
and monuments, but what of the van-
dals in Boston who defaced a monu-
ment to the 54th Massachusetts Infan-
try Regiment, the first African-Amer-
ican regiment to fight for the Union, 
whose bravery and skill was immor-
talized in the movie ‘‘Glory’’? 
What of the outlaws of Philadelphia, 
who defaced a statue of Matthias Bald-
win, a devout, passionate abolitionist? 
Mobs don’t discriminate between le-
gitimate and illegitimate targets of 
their destruction. That is because they 
are mobs. 
Lincoln also warned that the ‘‘law-
less in spirit’’ will become ‘‘lawless in 
practice’’ because of mob violence see-
ing no consequences for crimes. 
A mob doesn’t stop at statues. Riot-
ers have already torched police pre-
cincts and low-income housing in Min-
neapolis. 
Churches 
and 
synagogues 
have been vandalized. Next, perhaps 
the mob will target the homes of police 
officers, and soon enough the mob may 
come for you and your home and your 
family. 
As the mob expands its power, Lin-
coln cautioned that good citizens, ‘‘see-
ing their property destroyed; their 
families insulted, and their lives en-
dangered; their persons injured; and 
seeing nothing in prospect that fore-
bodes a change for the better; become 
tired of, and disgusted with, a Govern-
ment that offers them no protection.’’ 
Mob rule can only serve to demor-
alize our people and shake their faith 
in our government and our way of life. 
As the mob rises, civilization recedes. 
Finally, Lincoln observed that ‘‘by 
the operation of this mobocractic spir-
it, which all must admit, is now abroad 
in the land, the strongest bulwark of 
any Government, and particularly of 
those constituted like ours, may effec-
tually be broken down and destroyed— 
I mean the attachment of the People.’’ 
The final victim of mob rule is the 
very spirit of civic-minded patriotism 
that’s necessary to preserve our Repub-
lic. 
For all these reasons, Lincoln said: 
‘‘There is no grievance that is a fit ob-
ject of redress by mob law.’’ We cannot 
tolerate mob rule, and we cannot allow 
it to go unpunished. 
While local authorities would usually 
take the lead in prosecuting these 
criminals, 
unfortunately, 
many 
of 
them seem unwilling to stand up to the 
mob and uphold the rule of law. There-
fore, I call upon the Department of 
Justice to bring charges against these 
mob vigilantes, prosecuting them to 
the fullest extent of the law. The Anti- 
Riot Act and the Veterans’ Memorial 
Preservation and Recognition Act can 
provide legal grounds in some cases; 
still other Federal statutes may govern 
in other cases; but there must be con-
sequences for mob violence because if 
you give the mob an inch, it will take 
a mile. 
Witness the events of just this past 
weekend, where mobs tore down stat-
ues of George Washington and Ulysses 
S. Grant. When you tear down statues 
of Washington and Grant, it is not 
about the Civil War; it is because you 
hate America. Indeed, these rioters 
hate America. 
In Portland, where they tore down 
the statue of Washington, they also 
spray-painted on him the date ‘‘1619,’’ a 
reference to the New York Times’s re-
visionist, 
anti-American 
history 
project. Perhaps we should call them 
the ‘‘1619 riots.’’ After all, the archi-
tect of that execrable project said: ‘‘It 
would be an honor.’’ 
This hatred for America was nowhere 
on greater display than in San Fran-
cisco, where the mob tore down the 
statue of Grant. That would be U.S. 
Grant, commander of the Union Army, 
whose very initials embody his tena-
cious, unrelenting approach to war: un-
conditional surrender. 
That would also be President Grant, 
the political heir of Abraham Lincoln, 
a statesman who smashed the first Ku 
Klux Klan, signed the first major civil 
rights legislation, and presided over 
passage of the 15th Amendment. 
In one famous instance, President 
Grant sent in the troops to disperse a 
White mob in New Orleans that was 
terrorizing the city’s Black and Repub-
lican residents and had to depose the 
State’s lawful Governor. 
Grant had zero tolerance for mob 
rule. He said: ‘‘[N]either Ku Klux 
Klans, White Leagues, nor any other 
association using arms and violence to 
execute their unlawful purposes can be 
permitted in that way to govern any 
part of this country.’’ 
This was a man whom the great 
Frederick Douglass eulogized as ‘‘too 
broad for prejudice, too humane to de-
spise the humblest, too great to be 
small at any point.’’ Yet the mobs still 
came for Grant. 
Some people have been asking: Where 
is the line? I say: This is the line—the 
line between mob rule and the rule of 
law.

June 22, 2020 
Since I began by quoting Lincoln, let 
me conclude by borrowing from Grant, 
who wrote during the Battle of Spot-
sylvania: ‘‘I propose to fight it out on 
this line if it takes all summer.’’ 
I will fight it out on this line if it 
takes a lot longer than that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF CORY T. WILSON 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, later 
on this afternoon, the Senate will vote 
on cloture on the nomination of Judge 
Cory Wilson to fill a vacancy on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-
cuit. 
I rise at this point in strong, enthusi-
astic support of confirmation for my 
friend, Judge Cory Wilson. This will be 
a historic moment for this body and for 
the administration. A vote to confirm 
Judge Wilson would make him the 
200th judge to be confirmed under 
President Trump. This is the highest 
number of judges confirmed at this 
point in a Presidency since the Presi-
dency of Jimmy Carter. Judge Wilson 
is an outstanding nominee to have this 
distinction. 
The seat we are voting to fill is actu-
ally the last remaining circuit court 
vacancy at this time, reflecting the re-
markable progress we have made in re-
building the Federal judiciary. Judge 
Wilson is an outstanding nominee to 
mark this milestone. His credentials, 
intellect, and respect for the rule of 
law are well established. 
The American Bar Association is 
considered by many to be the ‘‘gold 
standard’’ for assessing judicial nomi-
nees, and the American Bar Associa-
tion has awarded Judge Wilson its 
highest rating of ‘‘well qualified’’ to 
serve on the Fifth Circuit. I certainly 
agree with this assessment by the ABA. 
In recent weeks, Senators on both 
sides of the aisle have been able to 
question Judge Wilson about his judi-
cial philosophy, and I believe he has 
shown a steadfast commitment to hon-
oring the Constitution and enforcing 
the laws passed by the Congress as we 
have written them. 
Judge Wilson is a native of South 
Mississippi and currently serves on the 
Mississippi Court of Appeals, where he 
decides appellate matters, including 
civil, commercial, domestic, and crimi-
nal appeals. He graduated from my 
alma mater, the University of Mis-
sissippi, with highest honors, and then 
he went on to Yale Law School, where 
he distinguished himself in many re-
spects. He served on the Yale Law 
Journal, was a member of the Yale 
chapter of the Federalist Society, and 
was on the Barrister’s Union, which is 
the equivalent of the Yale moot court. 
He served as a law clerk for the Court 
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, 
having been appointed and having 
served as a clerk for Judge Cox on the 
Eleventh Circuit. He was a White 
House fellow for the Department of De-
fense, and then he came back to Mis-
sissippi. 
Before becoming a judge, Cory Wil-
son was an accomplished lawyer in his 
own right in private practice and 
served in senior roles in State govern-
ment in the Mississippi Secretary of 
State’s office and the office of the 
State Treasury. For 3 years, he also 
represented Mississippi’s 73rd district 
in the State House of Representatives, 
where he was vice chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee. 
Judge Wilson is active in civic affairs 
and his church, Highlands Presbyterian 
Church. He and his wife Stephanie have 
one son. 
He has garnered respect and admira-
tion and endorsements from many of 
my constituents during the years of 
service, and in the last few weeks and 
days, I have been presented with let-
ters of endorsement from people who 
know him—lawyers he practiced with 
and people he has been associated with. 
In particular, I want to draw the atten-
tion of Members of the Senate to a let-
ter from retired Judge Robert L. Gibbs 
of Jackson, MS. 
Who is Judge Gibbs to write a letter 
on behalf of Cory Wilson? For one 
thing, we should know that Judge 
Gibbs is a Democrat, and he practiced 
law in Mississippi for a time for Mis-
sissippi legal services. He spent 10 
years in the office of the Mississippi at-
torney general, a statewide elected 
Democratic official, and then Robert 
Gibbs served as a circuit judge, an 
elected position in a Mississippi court 
of general jurisdiction. He served for 
some 7 years there as a circuit judge in 
Mississippi. That is who Judge Robert 
Gibbs is. 
Here is what Judge Gibbs says about 
our nominee, the very Cory Wilson 
whom we will be voting cloture on 
around 5:30 this afternoon. 
This is a letter dated June 10. It is to 
the chair and ranking member of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator 
GRAHAM and Senator FEINSTEIN. 
Dear Chairman Graham and Ranking Mem-
ber Feinstein: 
I submit this letter in support of the nomi-
nation of Judge Cory T. Wilson for a seat on 
the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
I am former Circuit Judge for the Eleventh 
Circuit Court District in Mississippi and 
have known Cory as an attorney, who prac-
ticed before me and as a colleague as we 
worked on cases together. From these expe-
riences, I can attest that no one works hard-
er in this profession than Judge Wilson. 
When we were representing clients, Cory 
would normally prepare the first draft of 
pleadings and send it to me to review. Sel-
dom were there any reasons to make changes 
because he utilized his legal abilities to navi-
gate through the complexities of the legal 
issues which resulted in a well thought out, 
plausible argument. 
During Judge Wilson’s investiture as a 
Judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals, I 
had the pleasure of being one of the speak-
ers. 
This is retired Judge Gibbs saying he 
had the pleasure of being one of the 
speakers. 
I spoke about three traits of Judge Wil-
son—(1) Respect, (2) Character and (3) Legal 
Intelligence. To keep this letter to a respect-
ful length, I will not repeat everything I said 
but the essence is, Cory respects everyone he 
comes into contact with, he does not change 
who he is because of race or political affili-
ations and his ability allow him to break 
through legal jargon and get to the point. 
Judge Gibbs goes on to say this: 
Judge Wilson and I are quite different—I 
am Black and he is White. I am older and he 
is younger. I am a Democrat and he was a 
Republican (before he became a judge). I live 
in the majority African American City of 
Jackson, Mississippi and he lives in a suburb 
of Jackson. Yet these differences have be-
come our strengths. We often have lunch and 
discuss the pressing issues of the day as 
friends. He has sought my advice, based on 
my judicial experience, on how to be a better 
judge. And while we may disagree on some 
matters, in the end we realize that we are 
just two lawyers who want our communities 
to be better and we know that having a fair 
judiciary is one of the ways to make that 
happen. 
These are the words of an older, re-
tired circuit judge who happens to be 
an African-American Democrat in en-
dorsement of a younger White Repub-
lican nominee whom we will have a 
chance to vote on in a few moments. 
We need more members of the younger 
generation of whatever race who are 
best friends with an older generation of 
professionals of another race. We need 
more people like Judge Robert Gibbs 
and Judge Cory Wilson who are friends, 
who sit down, who have lunch together 
and discuss the law and the ways we 
can make this country better. 
I think this is a profound endorse-
ment by someone of a different race, of 
a different political party, and of a dif-
ferent political philosophy, saying that 
Judge Cory Wilson is someone we will 
be proud to vote for. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this letter be printed in the 
RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
GIBBS TRAVIS PLLC, 
June 10, 2020. 
Re Nomination of Cory T. Wilson as Judge of 
the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Fifth Circuit. 
Hon. LINDSEY GRAHAM, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 
Ranking Member, Committee on the Judici-
ary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR

GRAHAM
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER FEINSTEIN: I submit this letter in

Wilson for a seat on the Fifth Circuit Court 
of Appeals. 
I am former Circuit Judge for the Eleventh

ties to navigate through the complexities of

ROBERT L. GIBBS. 
Mr. WICKER. Again, let me just 
stress to my colleagues that Cory Wil-
son has gained a reputation as a fair 
and impartial judge and a good and de-
cent man, and I am confident that this 
reputation will follow him as he serves 
on the Fifth Circuit. He will serve the 
circuit and our Nation well as a U.S. 
circuit judge. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as 
we have been working over these last 
several weeks to develop police reform 
legislation, I figured the best use of my 
time would be to spend that time lis-
tening, as much as anything else—lis-
tening, for example, to Black Ameri-
cans about their experiences with law 
enforcement and the changes they 
would like to see in our country; lis-
tening to my colleagues in the Senate 
about the most effective ways to make 
these changes, especially under the 
leadership of Senator TIM SCOTT, who 
has personally experienced the injus-
tices we are trying to address, and, par-
ticularly, this deficit of trust between 
law enforcement and the communities 
they serve; and listening to leaders in 
Texas who are working hard—in the 
midst of this pandemic and widespread 
protesting—to keep every single Texan 
safe. You would think, before we decide 
on what reforms to take, it is impor-
tant to hear from those who know best 
what is working, what isn’t, and what 
we need to do more of. 
A few weeks ago, I called two of my 
friends, who happen to be the mayor of 
Dallas and the mayor of Houston, Eric 
Johnson in Dallas and Sylvester Tur-
ner in Houston, and asked them to help 
me pull together a group of people in 
both of those major American cities for 
an 
open 
conversation 
about 
these 
issues. Less than a week later, I was in 
Dallas for an open and honest con-
versation with a group of law enforce-
ment, faith, and community leaders. 
They provided very useful feedback and 
ideas that I brought back with me 
while the JUSTICE Act was in draft 
form. After the bill was introduced last 
week, I was eager to hear from more 
folks in Texas. 
Last Friday, I traveled to Houston 
for another similar type of discussion 
at city hall. Like in Dallas, we were 
able to hear from a variety of points of 
view familiar with these challenges. I 
was glad to also be joined by Senator 
CRUZ and Congresswoman SHEILA JACK-
SON LEE. In a way, I thought it was a 
coincidence, but maybe not, that this 
conversation 
happened 
on 
Juneteenth—a day that allows us to re-
flect on the progress we have made in 
the fight for equality. This year—I 
would say more than normal—it was a 
reminder of how far we have to go. 
At this point, I would like to say the 
good news is there is a lot of common 
ground and good will, and I think we 
have a unique opportunity to do what I 
told the Floyd family I would do when 
they told me they wanted Texas-size 
justice. I think some good can actually 
come out of this tragedy, their loss of 
their loved one. 
I heard an inspiring message from 
Bishop James Dixon, who is the pastor 
at Community of Faith Church and 
first vice president of the Houston 
NAACP. He talked about the need for 
unity and action in response to the 
widespread protests we are seeing and 
encouraged everyone, as he put it, to 
‘‘dignify the outcry.’’ 
We need to affirm that, yes, there is 
a problem; yes, it has gone unaddressed 
for too long; and yes, we are going to 
do our best to do something about it. 
While there may be differences of opin-
ion on the best route to take, the good 
news is we are all pulling in the same 
direction. 
During our conversation, I was able 
to talk briefly about the JUSTICE Act, 
which was introduced, as I said, last 
week. 
Among 
other 
things, 
they 
seemed to be pleased the bill would 
strengthen deescalation training, as 
well as training on the duty to inter-
vene in case there is something inap-
propriate occurring, the use of body 
cameras, incentivizing the States to re-
strict the use of choke holds, and make 
lynching a Federal crime. 
I received some great feedback on 
how it will ensure that police depart-
ments nationwide are using proven 
best practices to keep our communities 
safe. As we prepare to debate this legis-
lation this week, that conversation 
could not have been more timely. 
Another common theme—and I have 
heard this before—is the growing strain 
on our law enforcement officers. I re-
member several years ago Chief David 
Brown saying: We ask our police to do 
too much. Basically, they are the ones 
who we know will go quickly to a crisis 
and intervene, no matter what it is, 
whether it is a domestic crisis, a men-
tal health crisis, or somebody breaking 
the law. Mayor Turner, in particular, 
talked about how the list of respon-
sibilities we are giving our law enforce-
ment officers keeps growing longer and 
longer and longer. They are not just 
fighting crime; they are responding to 
calls about drug abuse, mental health, 
domestic violence, homelessness, and a 
range of other crises. Between COVID– 
19 and the ongoing protests, their jobs 
are not getting any easier. 
As Police Chief Art Acevedo pointed 
out, police are performing these jobs 
not by design but because there is basi-
cally nobody else to do them—by de-
fault. There is no question we need 
more support services that can help al-
leviate some of this strain on our law 
enforcement officers. Over the years, 
we have tried to bolster services avail-
able for things like the First Step Act, 
which took prison reform from the 
State level to the national level. We 
put money into Project Safe Neighbor-
hoods grants and Mental Health and 
Safe Communities Act grants. In par-
ticular, I remember when we debated 
the Mental Health and Safe Commu-
nities Act grants to help train law en-
forcement to deescalate conflicts be-
tween people undergoing a mental 
health crisis, during which an esca-
lating level of crisis would be a threat 
not only to the individual who is un-
dergoing that crisis but to the officer, 
him or herself. We actually found it to 
be very effective, this training. 
As this list of responsibilities we are 
giving our law enforcement officers has 
grown, so has the need for additional 
training and additional funding for 
support 
services—ancillary 
services 
that can work in conjunction with our 
law enforcement officials so we can get 
the most efficient, most effective re-
sponse to the person who needs it. 
That is precisely why defunding the 
police is not the answer to the chal-
lenges we are facing. It is really an in-
sult, if you think about it, and it is liv-
ing in a fantasyland. 
Chief Acevedo shared an analogy a 
fellow police chief and friend of his 
made about the effort to shift responsi-
bility from police to other providers. 
He said: If you are building a new sta-
dium, you wouldn’t tear down or stop 
using the old one until the new one was 
complete.

lice departments without having other

support services in place, our commu-
nities wouldn’t be more safe; they 
would be significantly less safe. So 
rather than cutting funding while 
those services are being established 
and strengthened in cities across the 
country, let’s talk about the reforms 
that make sense. 
The most impactful reforms are 
going to be made at the State and local 
levels. We can’t be a city council for 
330 million people. Those responsibil-
ities, ultimately, are born at the local 
and State level. They are the ones ac-
countable to the voters for the actions 
they take or don’t take at the local 
level, but we know there is a role for us 
to play. Much of it has to do with iden-
tifying things like best practices, as 
well as providing money for training 
and resources. The hiring is done at the 
local level, officer training is con-
ducted there, and decisions about day- 
to-day police activities are made there. 
During our discussion, Mayor Turner 
expressed the need for folks in Con-
gress to listen to mayors, and I am all 
for that. For any law we pass or re-
forms we make, they will be the ones 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
the 
changes we make. 
I have been in close contact with my 
mayors and other officials across the 
State, and I don’t intend for that to 
stop once we, Lord willing, pass a po-
lice reform bill. 
This has to be an ongoing conversa-
tion between local officials, State offi-
cials, and those of us who happen to 
work here in Washington in the Con-
gress. This conversation is not going to 
be a brief one. It is not going to be a 
one-time conversation. This is going to 
stretch on for weeks and months. Real-
ly, what we are talking about is a cul-
tural change as much as anything else. 
I want to, once again, thank the men 
and women in Texas who wear the uni-
form of our police departments and 
those who shared with me their ideas 
and feedback over the last few weeks. 
It has been incredibly valuable and will 
become even more helpful as we begin 
debating the JUSTICE Act this week. 
Senator SCOTT, who is leading us on 
this legislative effort, has done a great 
job of compiling a broad set of reforms 
that will improve transparency and ac-
countability. Many of these provisions, 
as I said a few minutes ago, already 
enjoy broad bipartisan support. 
This legislation, I believe, will go a 
long way to improve accountability 
and transparency and deliver real 
change to communities across the 
country. I am glad that at Senator 
SCHUMER’s request, Senator MCCON-
NELL put a bill on the floor before the 
Fourth of July. That is specifically 
what Senator SCHUMER called for and 
exactly what Senator MCCONNELL said 
he intends to do. 
Now that we have the opportunity to 
turn talk into action, it does sound 
like our friends across the aisle are 
getting cold feet. I have been inter-
ested to read in the press where some 
of them said they haven’t really made 
up their mind whether they will even 
allow us to get on the bill. 
We can’t pass a bill that we can’t 
start. Once we start it, they will be 
given 
every 
opportunity 
to 
offer 
amendments to help improve the bill. 
But shutting it down just out of a fit of 
pique or overt politicalization does not 
do a service to the people we are trying 
to help here: to help our law enforce-
ment officials and to help the general 
public and people who sense a gap of 
trust between those officers and the 
law 
enforcement 
community 
they 
serve. 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
are 
weighing whether to block us from 
even considering this bill, one that will 
be put on the floor, debated and voted 
on, just as Senator SCHUMER, the 
Democratic leader, requested. Unfortu-
nately, our friends across the aisle 
seem focused more on the few dif-
ferences between Senator SCOTT’s bill 
and the House bill rather than the sim-
ilarities. This is where I think the 80– 
20 rule ought to apply. If we can agree 
to 80 percent or 70 percent or 60 per-
cent, why don’t we do that? Why don’t 
we put that in the bank and work on 
the rest? 
The truth is, there are many places 
where these bills overlap, and there is 
a lot of room for us to find common 
ground. In order to do that, our col-
leagues across the aisle need to do 
what maybe is not their first instinct 
and that is to cooperate—that is the 
only way we get things done here—and 
prove to the American people that they 
are sincere in their desire to see us de-
bate and pass effective reforms. There 
is a difference between doing that and 
just grandstanding and posturing, but 
this is not a time to grandstand. This 
is not a time to posture. This is a time 
to roll up our sleeves and work to-
gether to get things done. We need re-
alistic, resolute, and immediate action 
in order to repair that broken relation-
ship between law enforcement and 
some of the community they serve. So 
I hope our Democratic colleagues will 
join us in that effort this week. 
I appreciate, for one, the hard work 
and leadership of Senator SCOTT
in 
drafting this legislation, and I appre-
ciate the majority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, for prioritizing its consid-
eration on the floor. I am a proud co-
sponsor of the JUSTICE Act, and I look 
forward to voting for this bill when the 
opportunity comes. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I so enjoyed listening to the com-
ments of my colleague from Texas, and 
it causes me to think that, yes, we are 
moving forward with another week, 
and what we have to realize is that, in-
deed, our Nation was built on free 
speech and the premise to have dissent 
or robust, respectful political debate. 
That is something that keeps our Na-
tion strong. 
To go back and look at the work of 
our Founders, there was barely a day 
that went by that they were not having 
that robust debate, that they were not 
having those arguments that were real-
ly 
constructive 
conversations 
that 
would say: We are here; how do we go 
here? 
That is how you solve problems. In-
deed, that is what Tennesseans are tell-
ing me every day that they want us to 
do: Solve these problems. Let’s get our-
selves on the right track. 
When you look at it and go back and 
look at the Founders, you see that the 
debates they had were not superficial. 
They were not necessarily the bright, 
shiny object story of the day. They 
were deep, philosophical debates on 
issues that were about the future of the 
Nation they were trying to build. Ev-
erything was on the line, and no one 
kept quiet. They felt as if their opin-
ions 
were 
important, 
and 
indeed, 
today, there is a lot on the line when 
we talk about civility and when we 
talk about the strength, the core, and 
the preservation of our rights and our 
freedoms. Nobody spared anyone’s feel-
ings at that point because the stakes 
were too high and they were focused on 
freedom. 
How did they create a free nation? 
How did they create it so that it would 
pass to their children and their grand-
children? Indeed, you can go forward in 
history and look at the words of Ron-
ald Reagan reminding us that freedom 
is not something that is permanent. 
Every single generation—every single 
generation—has to fight for it. 
Madam President, of course, we say 
an extra thank-you to you and others 
in this Chamber who have worn the 
uniform and have served, and we are 
grateful for that service. 
I would state that, in spite of all the 
strife that our Founders went through, 
they never wavered from their commit-
ment to building a society that was, in 
their hearts and minds, a society of the 
people, for the people, by the people— 
of the people. It was freer and more 
Democratic than the land they had left 
in order to get here. 
The First Amendment to our Con-
stitution is more than just a prohibi-
tion against government repression. It 
is a warning against the private at-
tacks on free speech. The success of on-
line discussion platforms is a testa-
ment to how much the American peo-
ple still value the free exchange of 
ideas. 
Don’t you love it? In a good con-
versation with good friends, somebody 
makes their point, and you make a 
counterpoint. Then you discuss it, and 
you have a respectful conversation. 
Everyone from political candidates 
to corporations to the free press has 
taken advantage of the opportunity to 
reach those millions of eyeballs that 
are scrolling through social media 
timelines and news aggregation serv-
ices. For a while, it looked as if the 
system would revolutionize the way we 
read and the way that we share infor-
mation, the way we have that debate,

and it did—just not necessarily for the 
better. 
I believe we should always encourage 
more speech, and when you look at the 
early days of Twitter and Facebook, it 
seems that they were on the right 
track, and we kind of call that the 
good old days of social media. 
Over the past few weeks, we have 
seen these platforms devolve into a 
state of all-out war that makes our 
previous concerns about censorship and 
speech policing look petty. Liberal ac-
tivists have deployed against anyone 
and anything that strays from their 
preferred narrative. It is the cancel 
culture in full force. Even more con-
cerning than digital mob rule is the be-
havior of corporations and platforms 
caving to these intimidation tactics 
and selectively policing dissent. 
Just imagine what would have hap-
pened all those years ago in our found-
ing if one group decided they were 
going to shut up and quiet another 
group. What if they had decided that 
respect doesn’t matter? What if they 
had decided that debate doesn’t mat-
ter? It is our way or the highway. What 
do you think would have happened, and 
where would we be today? 
Google and its parent company, Al-
phabet, have distinguished themselves 
as the worst offenders. Google is under 
investigation for potential antitrust 
violations, but that hasn’t stopped 
them from surrendering to this latest 
political moment. Last week, Google 
threatened to kick two conservative- 
leaning media outlets off of the Google 
ads platform after determining content 
found in the respective sites’ comment 
sections violated platform policies. A 
representative 
from 
Google 
com-
plicated matters by running to the 
media and insisting that the ban was 
imposed because the Federalist and 
ZeroHedge had both published deroga-
tory comments promoting racial vio-
lence. NBC and other news organiza-
tions ran with that false narrative, and 
before you knew it, thousands of voices 
condemned in unison the speech and 
opinions of dozens of writers who had 
done nothing wrong. 
They were, as the left likes to say, 
‘‘deplatformed,’’ which, of course, was 
the goal. The ease with which Google 
fell in step with this coordinated cam-
paign to chill speech becomes all the 
more concerning when one considers 
that they didn’t just threaten the live-
lihoods of the writers, editors, and 
graphic designers employed by those 
outlets. Google employees let their 
bias—hear that?—Google employees let 
their bias, not the facts—not the facts, 
the bias—their bias, the bias that they 
bring to work with them, the bias of 
their worldview, which they think is 
right—they let their bias and their 
prejudice lead the way and decided that 
the American people didn’t need to see 
what those writers had to say. 
Who told them that they are the 
speech police? Who told them: Google, 
you are in charge. You decide what is 
going to be prioritized on your plat-
form. Google, you go in here, and you 
decide if this is worthy or unworthy 
content. It is all up to you. Google, you 
can subjectively manipulate these al-
gorithms based on what you think. 
What we have are Google employees 
who let their bias lead the way, and 
they decided that the American people 
didn’t need to see what writers had 
written because they, the employees’ 
superiors, decided you didn’t need to 
know that. They determined that the 
speech was dangerous, harmful, and il-
legitimate. So what did they do? They 
shut it down before you could browse 
it. 
Just imagine—just imagine—if the 
Founders had been so brazen in their 
actions: Let’s not have a discussion on 
that point. Let’s just throw it to the 
side. Let’s not hear somebody out. 
Let’s just push them aside. No, they 
didn’t form a clique who said: We are 
better than you. We are smarter than 
you. What did those Founders do? They 
looked at one another and said: We are 
all in this together. We are here be-
cause freedom is paramount in estab-
lishing a nation that is a nation of, by, 
and for the people—all of us. That is 
the goal. 
You know, I think what Google has 
done is a bold move coming from the 
same parent company that has allowed 
YouTube’s reprehensible comment sec-
tion to spiral into notoriety. But if you 
comment on the Federalist, beware. 
You see, it is not about protecting cus-
tomers. All they are doing is defending 
a dangerous and un-democratic double 
standard. 
These incidents are not isolated, and 
there is no meaningful choice pub-
lishers can make to take their business 
elsewhere because Google effectively 
controls online advertising. Last year, 
they brought in $100 billion in ad rev-
enue. You know, even in this town, $100 
billion is not chump change. That is a 
lot of money. 
This year they are flexing their mus-
cles against competitive conservative 
outlets just as more mainstream out-
lets are facing cutbacks and layoffs. I 
know this body is well aware that Big 
Tech needs some guide rails to control 
their approach to consumer privacy, 
data security, and these increasingly 
oppressive content moderation poli-
cies. 
Google is the main player. The ma-
jority of searches are done through 
Google. Is it a monopoly? Pretty close 
to it. Should it be viewed under anti-
trust? Worthy of discussion. Right now 
we are working out the proper strategy 
to reform the section 230 protections. 
This is written into the Communica-
tions Decency Act that the Googles of 
the world hide behind when they want 
to silence you, when they want to shut 
you down because they do not agree 
with you. Their bias is against you. 
Their prejudice is against you. They 
don’t like what you have to say. 
In this body we may not agree, but 
we will fight to defend the right of in-
dividuals to stand up and have their 
say. The First Amendment says that 
political speech is—guess what—free 
speech. The First Amendment says 
that you, the citizen—remember that 
line, ‘‘of the people.’’ The people have 
the right to petition their government 
to seek a change. But, oh no, Google or 
Facebook—I have to say, I remember 
the comment from Mark Zuckerberg 
that Facebook was more like a govern-
ment than a business. 
We have the Communications De-
cency Act, and there is a section in it 
called section 230, and that is the sec-
tion that Big Tech goes and cowers be-
hind when they want to shut you up. 
Section 230 needs to be reformed. DOJ 
has said that this is something that is 
ready for reform. We need to protect 
free speech. We need to make certain 
that illicit content is moved off. We 
need to look at competition. We need 
to look at the threshold for users— 
maybe not revenue—but look at a 
threshold for users and put some guide-
lines in place. We are dealing with an 
industry that has moved on to using 
social pressure to provide cover as they 
act as judge, jury, and executioner over 
what Americans should be allowed to 
know. 
If you are researching something on-
line, what do you do? You Google it. 
You get in that search engine; you go 
looking for it; and then you look at the 
things as they come up. Maybe what 
you are looking for doesn’t show up on 
the first page even though it is some-
thing that has been in the news. Why 
would that be? Oh, prioritization—be-
cause Google prioritizes how this infor-
mation gets delivered to you: if they 
like it, top of the list; if they don’t, 
bottom envelope. 
Today, I sent a letter to the Attorney 
General, outlining the threat this poses 
to a free and fair press and calling for 
a full investigation that examines the 
company’s control over the internet 
economy. I also encouraged AG Barr to 
meet with the news publishers who 
have been harmed by this anti-com-
petitive behavior and learn firsthand 
about the fear and intimidation tactics 
activists have weaponized against le-
gitimate journalism. 
This can no longer be chalked up 
simply to bias. The people making 
these decisions are the most powerful 
voices in the world, and they have de-
cided that they don’t want you to 
think. They don’t want you to chal-
lenge the narrative, and they sure 
don’t want you to rock the boat and 
draw the ire of activists who still don’t 
believe these efforts at censorship have 
gone far enough to silence conservative 
voices. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3121 
June 22, 2020 
The Senator from Iowa. 
STATE DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to have a letter 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, 
Washington, DC, June 12, 2020. 
Hon. CHUCK GRASSLEY, 
Chairman, Committee on Finance, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY: Your May 18 
letter to the President concerning his re-
moval of the Inspector General of the De-
partment of State has been referred to the 
Department. 
In order to address your concerns as they 
relate to the Department, the Department is 
prepared to provide you a briefing with a 
senior official at your earliest convenience. 
Additionally, the Department is enclosing 
its recent letter, on which you were copied, 
which addresses the reasons for Secretary 
Pompeo’s recommendation to remove the 
State Department Inspector General. 
Sincerely, 
MARY ELIZABETH TAYLOR, 
Assistant Secretary of State, 
Bureau of Legislative Affairs. 
Enclosure: As stated. 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, 
Washington, DC, June 8, 2020. 
Hon. MICHAEL E. HOROWITZ, 
Chair, Council of the Inspectors General on In-
tegrity and Efficiency, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR HOROWITZ: In light of new in-
formation disclosed to the State Department 
for the first time on June 2, 2020, the Depart-
ment is writing to formally request that the 
Council of the Inspectors General on Integ-
rity and Efficiency (CIGIE) examine a series 
of questions related to the conduct of former 
State Department Inspector General Steve 
Linick. Specifically, the Department has be-
come aware that Mr. Linick may have hand- 
selected a potentially-conflicted investigator 
to look into possible misconduct by his own 
office and then withheld the resulting report, 
which noted his own apparent non-compli-
ance with State Department Office of Inspec-
tor General (OIG) email policies, from State 
Department leadership, despite repeated re-
quests for a copy of the report. 
In short, the events described below sug-
gest that there may have been a significant 
breakdown in the typically-rigorous stand-
ards of an IG investigation, warranting 
CIGIE review. 
Mr. Linick had served as Inspector General 
of the State Department since September 
2013. On May 15, 2020, President Trump de-
cided to remove Mr. Linick from that posi-
tion and placed him on 30 days of adminis-
trative leave. As described in the attached 
letter to the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee dated June 1 (Tab 1), the President’s 
decision to remove Mr. Linick from this po-
sition was made upon the Secretary of 
State’s recommendation. This recommenda-
tion was based, in part, on concerns related 
to Mr. Linick’s failure to formally refer to 
CIGIE—as agreed with senior Department 
leadership in the fall of 2019—the investiga-
tion of a leak of a highly-sensitive draft re-
port to the media on September 13, 2019, 
which was attributed to ‘‘two government 
sources involved in carrying out the inves-
tigation.’’ State IG Set to Recommend Dis-
cipline for Trump’s Top Iran Hand, The 
Daily Beast, Sept. 13, 2019. 
As described in the Department’s attached 
letter, and contrary to that fall 2019 agree-
ment, Mr. Linick instead referred the matter 
for review by the Department of Defense’s 
(DOD’s) Acting Inspector General—without 
informing State Department leadership that 
he was taking a different course. Only after 
the DOD IG provided its initial findings di-
rectly to Mr. Linick in late 2019 or early 2020 
did Department leadership become aware 
that Mr. Linick had hand-selected his own 
investigator for the matter, outside of the 
CIGIE process. Mr. Linick then refused mul-
tiple requests by Department leadership for 
a copy of the resulting report. Notwith-
standing these repeated requests to Mr. 
Linick, who reports by law to the Secretary 
of State, the Department was, for the first 
time, provided a copy of the March 17, 2020 
DOD OIG report on June 2, 2020 (Tab 2) as a 
result of a request by Congress, nearly two 
weeks after the President removed Mr. 
Linick from his position. 
Beyond the concerning process that led to 
the DOD IG reviewing this matter, the DOD 
IG report itself raises a number of new ques-
tions that, together with the Department’s 
original concerns, further substantiate the 
Department’s misgivings with Mr. Linick’s 
performance as Inspector General and merit 
a review by an independent investigatory 
body. As we did originally with Mr. Linick, 
the Department renews its request that 
CIGIE review these questions. 
Breach of Agreed Steps for Investigating a 
Potential Leak from OIG. Last fall, State 
Department leadership asked Mr. Linick to 
refer for review by CIGIE the unauthorized 
disclosure of a draft inspector general report, 
which the media attributed to ‘‘two govern-
ment sources involved in carrying out the in-
vestigation’’. State IG Set to Recommend 
Discipline for Trump’s Top Iran Hand, The 
Daily Beast, Sept. 13, 2019. It was natural to 
assume that sources involved in ‘‘carrying 
out the investigation’’ may refer to sources 
within the State OIG, which—if true—would 
undermine confidence in the professionalism 
and integrity of the OIG. Mr. Linick agreed 
to the request, but the Department learned 
months later that, instead of formally refer-
ring the matter to CIGIE, Mr. Linick asked 
the DOD Acting Inspector General to review 
the issue. In other words, Mr. Linick failed 
to inform Department leadership that he had 
hand-picked another IG to investigate poten-
tial misconduct by his office and that he had 
deviated from the clear course agreed upon 
with leadership. 
Following the completion of a draft report 
by the DOD Acting Inspector General in late 
2019 or early 2020, Mr. Linick briefed Depart-
ment leadership on certain findings but re-
fused to provide the written report, or even 
a written summary, to Department leader-
ship for review, raising further concerns 
about the fairness of the process followed. As 
of the time of Mr. Linick’s removal, the De-
partment had still not received any docu-
mented findings on the matter. By contrast, 
an appropriate referral to CIGIE would have 
produced a final report that Department 
leadership could review and assess whether 
there may have been inappropriate conduct 
in Mr. Linick’s office. 
Potential Conflict of Interest in Choice of 
Investigator. The person whom Mr. Linick 
asked to review the matter, outside of the 
CIGIE process, was then-DOD Principal Dep-
uty Inspector General Glenn Fine, who at 
the time was the DOD’s Acting Inspector 
General. This was an unusual choice because 
Mr. Fine appears to have been a fact witness, 
potentially one with knowledge of informa-
tion relevant to the subject of the investiga-
tion described in the report. Specifically, the 
DOD OIG report notes that Mr. Linick said 
that he ‘‘spoke about the evaluation report’’ 
with Mr. Fine before the media leak oc-
curred. If Mr. Fine himself had confidential 
information about the draft report before it 
was leaked, it raises serious questions as to 
whether it was appropriate for him to lead 
the investigation into the subsequent leak. 
It is unclear whether Mr. Fine was even 
interviewed in the course of the investiga-
tion. Allowing a fact witness to an investiga-
tion to shape the terms of the investiga-
tion—let alone lead the investigation—seems 
inappropriate. At a minimum, the choice of 
investigator in this case raises material con-
cerns about whether the report itself rep-
resents a complete and adequate investiga-
tion of potential misconduct within the 
State Department Office of Inspector Gen-
eral. 
Limited Investigation. As noted above, the 
Department finally received a copy of the 
DOD Acting Inspector General’s report on 
June 2, 2020, and following the Department’s 
review, the Department has identified a 
number of concerns as to its scope. For ex-
ample, the report notes that Mr. Linick him-
self ‘‘asked the DoD OIG to conduct a limited 
inquiry into whether any DOS OIG employee 
was the source of the unauthorized disclo-
sure.’’ (emphasis added). The DOD OIG con-
ducted personal interviews, in which all 
interviewed staffers ‘‘said they did not re-
lease any information in the report to the 
media.’’ The DOD OIG also reviewed official 
email accounts and found that no employee 
directly sent an email from their State De-
partment email address to the news media, 
other than the communications director. 
However, the scope of this review appears 
to have been exceedingly cursory, and the re-
port itself indicates that the scope of the in-
vestigation was by design ‘‘limited.’’ It is 
also unclear whether it was appropriate for 
Mr. Linick, as a fact witness to the inves-
tigation, to dictate the ‘‘limited’’ scope 
(rather than a ‘‘full’’ scope) given the signifi-
cance of the leak. It is hard to imagine that 
an OIG or CIGIE would, in the course of its 
normal investigations, allow possible fact 
witnesses or interviewees to influence the 
scope of the investigation. Moreover, merely 
asking an interviewee if he/she directly 
transmitted the leaked documents and ask-
ing only about emails from official accounts 
would catch only the most blatant mis-
handling of information and would fail to un-
cover any person who disclosed the draft 
through an intermediary or sent the report 
from a personal email address. Further, the 
DOD IG does not appear to have questioned 
whether any interviewee had knowledge of 
who may have improperly disclosed the re-
port or engaged in other questioning aimed 
at discovering the true source of the leak. 
Use and Concealment of Improper Email 
Practice. The DOD OIG report identifies a 
concerning email practice used by Mr. 
Linick. The DOD OIG found: ‘‘IG Linick sent 
a password-protected, draft version of the 
evaluation report in question to his Gmail 
account eight times over six days in August 
2019. On one occasion, he emailed a password- 
protected draft of the evaluation report from 
his Gmail email account to his government 
email account.’’ As the DOD OIG report 
notes, this usage appeared to contravene the 
State Department OIG’s own policy: ‘‘Use 
OIG provided equipment and systems/appli-
cations at all times, including OIG email, to 
conduct official OIG business. The use of cor-
porate or personal equipment, systems/appli-
cations, to include to email, or other file 
storage sites to store, process, or transmit 
OIG or Department data is prohibited.’’ 
State OIG Information Systems Rules of Be-
havior. Mr. Linick clearly should have fol-
lowed his own organization’s specific infor-
mation security policies—particularly in-
volving a draft report on a highly-sensitive 
personnel issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3122 
June 22, 2020 
We understand that Mr. Linick may have 
received the initial report noting his im-
proper usage of personal email as early as 
late 2019 or early 2020, and it is the Depart-
ment’s understanding that he never shared 
the written report with any person at the 
State Department (including in his own of-
fice), despite repeated requests by Depart-
ment leadership for a copy of the report. 
Likewise, he never informed State Depart-
ment leadership that the report found that 
he did not comply with OIG email practices. 
Allowing the head of an investigated office 
to determine the manner and scope of the re-
lease of a report that addresses his own con-
duct is inappropriate, which is presumably 
why CIGIE’s own guidelines would have re-
quired the results of a CIGIE review to be 
shared with appropriate officials in his su-
pervisory chain. 
OIG Launches Questionable Parallel Inves-
tigation Under a Possible Conflict of Inter-
est. At the same time that the DOD IG was 
conducting its review, Mr. Linick reportedly 
opened a parallel investigation of other 
State Department employees for the same 
potential misconduct for which his own of-
fice was being investigated. See Kylie At-
wood, Fired State Department inspector gen-
eral was cleared in leak inquiry prior to his 
removal, sources say, CNN, May 28, 2020. This 
decision, if accurately reported, seems un-
usual because the September 2019 media leak 
was specifically attributed to ‘‘two govern-
ment sources involved in carrying out the in-
vestigation’’ (emphasis added), not to Depart-
ment employees who may have been fact wit-
nesses (and were clearly not responsible for 
‘‘carrying out’’ any investigation). 
Mr. Linick’s decision also raises the ques-
tion of whether this parallel investigation 
was intended to divert attention from the 
DOD IG’s own investigation into the State 
OIG. Indeed, public reporting suggests that 
State OIG was continuing its own investiga-
tions of other Department employees before 
the DOD OIG report was even finalized. See 
id. It should have been obvious to Mr. Linick 
that launching a parallel investigation into 
the same misconduct for which he and his 
own office were being investigated created 
both a real and apparent conflict of interest 
and risked interfering with the DOD OIG in-
vestigation into his own office. An investi-
gator who is still working to clear his or her 
own name has a motive to shift the blame to 
another person. 
Inappropriate Contacts with OIG Staff in 
an Apparent Attempt to Obtain Department 
Records, Contrary to Instruction. When Mr. 
Linick was removed from his position on 
May 15 and placed on administrative leave, 
his physical access was terminated, and he 
was clearly instructed by Department offi-
cials not to contact OIG staff members about 
official matters or return to his former of-
fice, without authorization by Department 
officials, who would facilitate any such con-
tacts. 
However, it has come to the Department’s 
attention that he has violated these instruc-
tions on multiple occasions while he was on 
administrative leave. For example, we un-
derstand that, in the days before his Con-
gressional testimony, he sent a text message 
to the Deputy Inspector General, Diana 
Shaw, requesting a copy of the DOD IG re-
port. Without informing her own chain of 
command, we understand that Ms. Shaw 
then contacted the DOD Office of Inspector 
General to request a copy of the report on 
Mr. Linick’s behalf. It is not clear what Mr. 
Linick’s motivation was, but it was not his 
decision (nor his former Deputy’s) to make 
this request for release given that he was, at 
the time, on administrative leave pursuant 
to the President’s decision with a new Act-
ing Inspector General in place. We under-
stand that Mr. Linick has repeatedly re-
turned to his former office without seeking 
authorization from his Department superi-
ors, also contrary to the clear instructions 
he received. Mr. Linick should follow the 
same rules that apply to other government 
officials who are placed on administrative 
leave in such circumstances; he is not enti-
tled to a different set of rules. 
A Pattern of Leaks Continues. Even 
though no one at the State Department 
other than Mr. Linick appears to have had a 
copy of the DOD Inspector General’s report 
(not even his Deputy) before June 2, 2020, 
CNN ran a story on May 28, 2020 that the 
DOD OIG report had exonerated Mr. Linick 
of leaking. Kylie Atwood, Fired State De-
partment inspector general was cleared in 
leak inquiry prior to his removal, sources 
say, CNN, May 28, 2020. These reports raise 
additional concerns as to this disturbing pat-
tern of leaks, further warranting CIGIE re-
view. 
Last fall, the Department had serious con-
cerns with the leak of a draft State Depart-
ment OIG report and recommended that re-
view by CIGIE was the appropriate step for 
an independent review. Unfortunately, Mr. 
Linick’s failure to follow through on that 
course—or to seek agreement from his re-
porting chain on any change in course—has 
only 
confirmed 
the 
Department’s 
rec-
ommendation and has raised even further 
concerns about Mr. Linick’s judgment and 
conduct. 
Therefore, we ask CIGIE to investigate not 
only the original unauthorized disclosure, 
but the conduct described in this letter. 
Sincerely, 
BRIAN BULATAO, 
Under Secretary for Management, 
U.S. Department of State. 
BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
as Americans, our understanding of 
history has a tremendous impact on 
our sense of who we are and where we 
are headed. That is why it is so impor-
tant for Americans to have a good un-
derstanding of our history—all of our 
history. 
Slavery is a great stain on our coun-
try’s history, and its legacy impacts us 
yet today. We must not flinch from 
recognizing the suffering inflicted on 
so many Americans, contrary to our 
highest ideals as a nation. 
Still, our Nation is unique in human 
history in that it was founded not on 
the basis of some sort of common eth-
nic identity but on certain enduring 
principles that are the equal heritage 
of all Americans. Those principles are 
best articulated in the simple but elo-
quent words of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. I don’t have to put quotes 
around these because everybody knows 
these words: ‘‘We hold these truths to 
be self-evident, that all people are cre-
ated equal, that they are endowed by 
their Creator with certain unalienable 
Rights, that among these are Life, Lib-
erty, and the pursuit of Happiness.’’ 
Our patriot forefathers concluded 
that these principles were worth fight-
ing for, and, indeed, they took up arms. 
The odds were stacked against them, 
and they happened to know that, but 
they, nonetheless, risked everything 
because they believed so deeply in 
those fundamental truths that were 
stated in the Declaration of Independ-
ence. 
Among those who risked life and 
limb for our Nation’s founding prin-
ciples were between 5,000 and 10,000 
Americans of African descent who vol-
unteered to serve as soldiers and sail-
ors during the American Revolution. 
Their patriotic sacrifices at the very 
beginning of our Nation contributed 
immeasurably toward laying the foun-
dation of the freedoms we enjoy today. 
The civil rights movement was later 
able to build on that solid foundation 
by calling on America to, as Dr. King 
said, ‘‘live out the true meaning of its 
creed.’’ Dr. King was absolutely right 
in pointing out that Black Americans 
have every right to fully claim our 
shared heritage as Americans, having 
helped build and shape American insti-
tutions and society from the beginning, 
as shown by the very sacrifice they 
made in the Revolutionary War. This 
proud history is part of who we are as 
Americans, but it is too little under-
stood and, hence, fully not appreciated. 
That is why I was proud to colead 
legislation that authorized the estab-
lishment of a National Liberty Memo-
rial on the National Mall to honor the 
underappreciated 
contributions 
of 
Black Revolutionary War veterans and 
patriots, as they are. 
I am proud to say that Iowa can 
claim at least one of those patriots, 
Cato Mead, who was born in Con-
necticut and is listed in Revolutionary 
War pension court records as a ‘‘free 
person of color’’ who lived out his twi-
light years in Southeastern Iowa. He is 
buried in the Montrose Cemetery in 
Montrose, IA. 
The National Mall Liberty Fund is 
now in the process of raising money for 
an environmental assessment to com-
plete final site selection for this very 
important memorial. 
Now, more than ever, Americans 
need this monument as a tangible re-
minder that despite the lingering leg-
acy of slavery, the promise of liberty 
and equality is a shared heritage of all 
Americans from the founding genera-
tion to this very day. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. 
SHAHEEN. 
Mr. 
President, 
States across this country, including 
New Hampshire, are beginning to re-
open after this pandemic, although, the 
pandemic isn’t really over. The ongo-
ing economic and public health fallout 
from COVID–19 continues to affect fam-
ilies and businesses in my State of New 
Hampshire and across this country. 
Every day, community leaders, pub-
lic health professionals, and frontline 
workers tell me about what they are 
facing. They have raised concerns

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3123 
June 22, 2020 
about the massive reduction in local 
tax revenue and the very difficult deci-
sions that will soon need to be made if 
Federal assistance doesn’t arrive soon. 
I have heard from teachers and 
school administrators about the chal-
lenges they have encountered trying to 
educate their students during the pan-
demic and the difficulties they are an-
ticipating as they begin to plan for the 
school year coming in September. 
The shift to remote learning has ex-
posed the disparities in broadband ac-
cess across New Hampshire and across 
this country that leaves behind many 
students and makes it extremely dif-
ficult for teachers to deliver a quality 
education, especially for students with 
disabilities. 
So many small businesses, while they 
are very grateful for the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program and the loans and 
grants that have been made available 
through the Economic Injury Disaster 
Loan Program, are telling me it is not 
enough; that revenues for many of 
these small businesses are still at 
unsustainable lows, particularly for 
those in tourism, entertainment, and 
hospitality—in New Hampshire, tour-
ism is our second largest industry—and 
that they need help if they are going to 
weather this storm. 
So I can’t understand why this body 
and why Majority Leader MCCONNELL 
doesn’t feel a sense of urgency to pass 
legislation that will continue to help 
Americans during this time of crisis. 
It has been more than 1 month since 
the House of Representatives sent to us 
the Heroes Act to continue to provide 
assistance to Americans who are in 
need. In the time since, we have not 
taken up any proposal that would pro-
vide comprehensive relief for the sec-
tors of our economy that are still hurt-
ing. 
We just can’t wait until the end of 
July, when we know that there will be 
so many families, workers, and busi-
nesses across the country who will be 
in an even more dire position than they 
are now. 
Americans are urging Congress to 
act, and we should work together in a 
bipartisan way, just as we did with the 
first three—really, four, if you count 
the second count of the small business 
assistance. Those four bills all passed 
with strong bipartisan votes. Now it is 
time for us to do that again, to provide 
Americans with the relief they so des-
perately need. 
Congress has taken some very impor-
tant bipartisan steps to provide assist-
ance to the Nation, but the conversa-
tions I have had with Granite Staters 
on the frontlines are a very powerful 
reminder of how much work still lies 
ahead. 
We should provide assistance for our 
hospitals and healthcare providers, es-
pecially for nursing homes and long- 
term care facilities because, in New 
Hampshire, they have accounted for 
more than 70 percent of COVID–19 
deaths, and across the country, for a 
very high percentage. 
We need to provide support to all of 
our essential workers who are still on 
the frontlines getting out there every 
day, despite the health risks; that in-
cludes 
grocery 
store 
workers, 
healthcare workers, and first respond-
ers who are sacrificing so much for our 
health and safety. 
We should provide investments in our 
Nation’s 
infrastructure, 
like 
broadband, to make sure we have bet-
ter access to telehealth and education 
opportunities. 
We should provide support for sectors 
of our economy that have taken major 
losses, like the clean energy sector, 
which has lost more than 600,000 jobs 
over the past few months. 
We should provide help for food and 
rental assistance for those who have 
lost income and are struggling to make 
ends meet. 
We should support the Postal Service 
so it can continue to serve our commu-
nities and small businesses. In New 
Hampshire, we have so many small 
towns that depend on the Postal Serv-
ice for prescription drugs. Families in 
those towns depend on the Postal Serv-
ice for prescription drugs and to com-
municate with the outside world. Espe-
cially now, when so many people are 
still feeling so isolated, they need to 
know they can count on the Postal 
Service and that it is not going to get 
into a financial crisis this summer. 
Finally, we need to support our 
States and our local communities. 
They have been on the frontlines fight-
ing this pandemic. As the cost of 
COVID–19 response efforts continue to 
rise, mayors, town administrators, and 
county officials are all grappling with 
whether they are going to have to lay 
off first responders, firefighters, police, 
teachers, and municipal workers—all of 
those people who continue to provide 
services in our communities and with-
out whom people are going to face even 
more dire consequences. States and 
communities need help now. They 
should not have to cut essential serv-
ices and frontline workers. 
In Congress, we must also provide ad-
ditional support to small businesses. 
PPP, the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, by any measure, despite some of 
the challenges, has been the most sig-
nificant small business assistance pro-
gram in our Nation’s history. It has de-
livered over $500 billion in aid in a very 
short time. 
I am proud to have worked with a bi-
partisan group of colleagues to offer 
that provision, but when we first sat 
down to design it just over 3 months 
ago, none of us had any concept of the 
magnitude of this crisis or what would 
be its duration. Since then, we have 
learned just how devastating this dis-
ease is and how terribly difficult it is 
to defeat. 
I 
have 
heard 
from 
so 
many 
businesspeople in New Hampshire who 
took a PPP loan. They used the pro-
ceeds just as we had intended: They 
kept their employees on the payroll or 
they hired them back if they had al-
ready laid them off. They have kept 
their lights on. Now it is time—when 
they are beginning to reopen their 
businesses, and they are still running 
short because those loans are about to 
run out, they need more help. If we 
don’t provide it, they are going to lay 
off all those workers again. For many 
small businesses, they are going to be 
forced to close their doors. 
Last week, I was pleased to work 
with Senators CARDIN and COONS to in-
troduce the Prioritized Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, the P4 Act. That is 
legislation that would provide a second 
round of PPP funding for smaller busi-
nesses and particularly for those in the 
restaurant and hospitality industries 
which have been hit especially hard in 
recent months. They were the first to 
be closed down by government order, 
and they are the last to be able to open 
back up. 
I am hopeful that, once again, we can 
work in a bipartisan way to make a 
proposal that will have support on both 
sides of the aisle and that will ensure 
that more businesses can stay afloat as 
we reopen our economy. 
Our country is still hurting, and the 
coronavirus isn’t going to go away 
without a vaccine. It is going to take a 
while for us to get back on our feet as 
a nation. 
The devastating health and economic 
effects from COVID–19 will not be alle-
viated just because we pretend the 
coronavirus is going away. It will not 
be alleviated unless Congress acts. It 
was the decisive action that we took 
back at the end of February and March 
that has allowed so many businesses to 
stay afloat, so many families to con-
tinue to feed their kids and to pay 
their rent. It is going to be critical for 
us to continue to take action to pro-
vide that assistance. 
We can’t wait. We can’t take a wait- 
and-see approach. We know that people 
are hurting right now. So I urge the 
Senate to take up and pass legislation. 
Let’s negotiate what we don’t like 
about the Heroes Act. Let’s make 
changes, but let’s take up that relief 
bill and continue to provide the help 
Americans are calling for. We have no 
more time to waste. 
Thank you.

f 
WORLD REFUGEE DAY 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this past 
Saturday, June 20, we marked the 20th 
commemoration of World Refugee Day. 
Since 2000, World Refugee Day annu-
ally shines a light on the struggles of 
displaced people all over the globe and 
encourages us all to redouble our ef-
forts to help them. 
We are currently experiencing the 
most severe refugee crisis in recorded 
history. There are almost 80 million 
forcibly displaced people worldwide, of 
which more than 30 million are refu-
gees and asylum-seekers. Every 2 sec-
onds, someone is forced to leave his or 
her home because of conflict or perse-
cution. That means that, since I began 
speaking, roughly 20 individuals have 
become newly displaced. 
These numbers are staggering and 
difficult to comprehend, but try to 
imagine for a moment what it means 
to be a refugee: to watch your home 
torn apart by conflict; to become the 
target of violence and oppression; to 
fear so greatly for your life and the 
lives of your loved ones that you 
choose to leave everything you know 
behind and take a dangerous journey to 
a place where the language and the cul-
ture are unfamiliar, where you have no 
support system, where you may strug-
gle every day to make ends meet. 
This nightmare is the reality for al-
most 80 million human beings around 
the world. The situation has only wors-
ened since the outbreak of the global 
COVID–19 pandemic. The majority of 
refugees are in low and middle-income 
countries, where weak health systems 
are already struggling to provide the 
basics of care. According to the Inter-
national Rescue Committee, just 34 
conflict-affected and fragile countries 
could see between 500 million and 1 bil-
lion COVID–19 infections, leading to be-
tween 1.7 million and 3.2 million deaths 
over the course of the pandemic. Fur-
thermore, refugees and displaced per-
sons tend to live in precarious condi-
tions that make them even more vul-
nerable to the coronavirus. They often 
live in crowded housing situations with 
little access to basic hygiene services, 
the perfect breeding ground for infec-
tious diseases to spread. For instance, 
there are about 850,000 Rohingya refu-
gees living in congested camps in Cox’s 
Bazar 
in 
Bangladesh. 
As 
the 
coronavirus began to take hold there in 
March, experts warned that the lack of 
sanitation and capacity for social 
distancing in these refugee camps 
would create the ‘‘perfect storm’’ for 
transmission of the disease. 
Additionally, many refugees are em-
ployed in informal industries with lit-
tle to no options for sick leave, re-
stricted access to public health serv-
ices, and have few, if any, resources to 
weather the financial burden of quar-
antine measures. Many are forced to 
defy stay-at-home orders to find ways 
to support their families, risking their 
health and that of their loved ones to 
provide basic shelter and food. 
Take, for example, the story of Or-
lando, a member of an indigenous com-
munity in Venezuela who is among the 
4.5 million Venezuelan migrants and 
refugees who have fled the country’s 
hunger, violence, and insecurity since 
2014. He now lives in Brazil with 18 
other families from his indigenous 
group. He and his family make their 
living as artisans, but when lockdown 
orders prevented them from selling 
their crafts, they could no longer af-
ford rent. All 120 of the individuals liv-
ing in his house were expelled, sent to 
the street in the middle of a pandemic. 
Meanwhile, many of Orlando’s family 
members became sick with the virus, 
and one sadly passed away, devastating 
the community. Unfortunately, stories 
like this one are common among refu-
gees. 
The good news is that there are a 
number of incredible multilateral and 
nongovernmental organizations work-
ing tirelessly to ensure that displaced 
people are safe, healthy, supported, and 
treated with the dignity they deserve. 
These organizations deserve our grati-
tude and, more importantly, our assist-
ance. In my home State of Maryland, 
organizations such as the IRC, Lu-
theran Immigration and Refugee Serv-
ice, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Soci-
ety—now HIAS—and World Relief are 
there to help refugees start a new life 
in the United States. Especially now, 
as the COVID–19 pandemic stretches re-
sources and capacity of service pro-
viders around the world, it is critical 
that the United States do its part to 
help address the refugee crisis. 
That is why I joined all the other 
democratic members of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee in intro-
ducing legislation to provide an addi-
tional $9 billion in funding for inter-
national efforts to fight the COVID–19 
pandemic and strengthen our refugee 
resettlement process to accommodate 
those affected by the global health cri-
sis. I also urged Secretary of State 
Pompeo to contribute at least $500 mil-
lion to the U.N. campaign to protect 
displaced and disadvantaged persons 
around the world from the coronavirus. 
Historically, the United States has 
prided itself on offering safe harbor to 
the world’s refugees. This country, 
after all, was founded by a group of 
people fleeing religious persecution.

perhaps the most famous symbol of 
American

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3125 
June 22, 2020 
reads, ‘‘Give me your tired, your poor, 
your 
huddled 
masses 
yearning 
to 
breathe free.’’ But we have not always 
lived up to the values on that inscrip-
tion. When World War II displaced mil-
lions of Jews, many of them sought 
asylum in the United States. Thou-
sands were turned away and sent back 
to their deaths in their home coun-
tries. The most infamous incident was 
a ship called the St. Louis that carried 
almost 1,000 Jewish refugees to a port 
in Miami. After being denied entry and 
forced to return to Europe, more than 
a quarter of those passengers perished 
in the Holocaust. 
It is important to acknowledge and 
learn from dark chapters in our history 
like this one, so that we can do a bet-
ter job of respecting and protecting 
human life moving forwards. This is 
why I have been so troubled by Presi-
dent 
Trump’s 
anti-refugee 
policies. 
Whether by making the lowest Presi-
dential determination on refugee ad-
missions in the program’s history or by 
locking 
up 
asylum-seekers 
at 
our 
southern border, the Trump adminis-
tration has turned our Nation’s back 
on those fleeing violence and oppres-
sion and stained the U.S. reputation as 
a champion of human rights. 
We cannot allow these policies to 
continue. First and foremost, they are 
wrong. This sort of behavior violates 
the most basic tenets of our democ-
racy: equality, freedom, and justice. 
But beyond that, it actively hurts our 
country to ignore the plight of refu-
gees. When we shirk our responsibility 
as a global leader in humanitarian as-
sistance, we exacerbate worldwide in-
stability that will affect us, too. More-
over, by closing our doors to refugees, 
we miss out on the valuable contribu-
tions that they make to our society. 
Think of the contributions to science, 
art, and politics that refugees like Al-
bert Einstein, Gloria Estefan, and Mad-
eline Albright have made to the United 
States and to humanity. As I speak, 
think of all the displaced people 
around the world who are working on 
the frontlines of the COVID–19 pan-
demic to help keep their adopted com-
munities, including ours, safe. 
To improve our country’s treatment 
of refugees, I worked with Senators 
LEAHY, BOOKER, and HARRIS and Rep-
resentative ZOE LOFGREN to introduce 
the Refugee Protection Act of 2019. 
This bill is a comprehensive blueprint 
for reinvigorating U.S. refugee and asy-
lum systems. It bolsters the U.S. Ref-
ugee Admission Program and expands 
protections for refugees, and restores 
due process and dignity for asylum 
seekers. Broadly, it seeks to repair the 
U.S. role as a refuge for the persecuted. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this crucial, lifesaving measure. 
The most important thing to remem-
ber is that refugees are our fellow 
human beings who have found them-
selves in the most difficult of cir-
cumstances. They are brothers, daugh-
ters, 
fathers, 
grandmothers, 
and 
friends. They have ideas, hopes, and as-
pirations and deserve the same respect, 
security, dignity, and opportunity we 
wish for ourselves and our families and 
friends. This World Refugee Day, let us 
recommit to providing safe harbor to 
the vulnerable, no matter where they 
are from. I always like to say that our 
values are our strength, so let us live 
by our values and help build a brighter 
future for all the world’s peoples.

TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL 
PATRICK ‘‘PAT’’ A. PIERCEY 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I 
wish to pay tribute to a great leader 
and an exceptional officer, Rear Admi-
ral Patrick ‘‘Pat’’ A. Piercey who will 
soon retire from the U.S. Navy after 
over 35 years of dedicated service to 
the Nation. Rear Admiral Piercey is a 
native of Clinton, OK, and graduated 
with distinction from the U.S. Naval 
Academy in 1985. He is a true profes-
sional and a dedicated leader. Through-
out his career, he commanded our 
great sailors at many levels, deployed 
numerous times in defense of the Na-
tion and served in some of the most 
critical positions in our Navy. Rear Ad-
miral Piercey has provided outstanding 
leadership, advice, and sound profes-
sional judgment on numerous critical 
issues of enduring importance to the 
Navy, Congress, and the Nation. 
Rear Admiral Piercey commanded 
USS Howard—DDG 83—USS Bunker 
Hill—CG 52—Carrier Strike Group 9, 
and Naval Surface Forces Atlantic. 
Due to his sound judgment and intel-
lect, Rear Admiral Piercey served in 
many critical assignments, including 
special assistant to the Deputy Direc-
tor of the White House Office of Man-
agement and Budget, executive assist-
ant to the Assistant to the Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Director 
for Operations—J3—U.S. Inda-Pacific 
Command. 
For the past 2 years, Rear Admiral 
Piercey has served as the Chief of Staff 
of U.S. European Command in Stutt-
gart, Germany. During this period of 
extraordinary change and challenge in 
Europe’s security environment, Rear 
Admiral Piercey has improved rela-
tionships with NATO allies and Euro-
pean partners. Through his strategic 
vision, he has successfully positioned 
U.S. European Command to meet every 
mission requirement in Europe. 
On behalf of my colleagues and the 
entire U.S. Congress, I want to thank 
Rear Admiral Piercey for his decades 
of dedicated service to the Navy and 
our Nation. I am sure that many offi-
cers and sailors will continue to emu-
late him as a role model for service, 
sacrifice and leadership. I also want to 
thank his wife, Katherine, and their 
children, Rebecca and Andrew, for 
their sacrifices and tremendous sup-
port. I join my colleagues in wishing 
him and his family fair winds and fol-
lowing seas and future success in re-
tirement. 
TRIBUTE TO JOSH JORGENSEN 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I 
rise to recognize Josh Jorgensen, a leg-
islative aide in my Washington, DC, of-
fice, for all of the hard work he has 
done for me, his colleagues, and the 
State of South Dakota. 
Josh is a native of Sioux Falls, SD. 
He is a graduate of Bishop O’Gorman 
High School in Sioux Falls, SD, and 
the University of South Dakota in 
Vermillion, SD. During his under-
graduate career, Josh majored in jour-
nalism and political science and served 
as president of the College Repub-
licans. 
Josh first joined my office as an in-
tern in the spring of 2016. During this 
time, he proved himself to be a diligent 
and dedicated worker and became a 
true asset to my office. 
He later returned as a senior legisla-
tive correspondent, and through hard 
work and dedication, he worked his 
way up to legislative aide, handling 
Tribal relations, healthcare, and edu-
cation issues for my office. Josh has 
played an instrumental role in my of-
fice by providing insight and guidance 
into these issues. 
Josh has been a dedicated and faith-
ful public servant during his time 
working in the Senate. I extend my 
sincere thanks and appreciation to him 
for his fine work. As he continues on 
with his career, he bears the esteem of 
a grateful State and my utmost grati-
tude for a job well done.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN ASHCRAFT 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Carolyn Ashcraft on 
her retirement as State librarian and 
director of the Arkansas State Library 
after 15 years of transformative leader-
ship. 
Carolyn has a dedication to the State 
of Arkansas and a passion for books, 
and her departure from a career that 
blended the two will leave a significant 
void in Arkansas’ library community. 
Her enthusiasm for libraries has been 
evident since childhood, leading to an 
invitation to serve as a student library 
aide in sixth grade. She went on to 
serve in a similar position at the uni-
versity level while earning her degree 
in English at the University of Arkan-
sas at Monticello. She continued her 
education at the University of Ala-
bama, where she earned a master’s de-
gree in library science. In 1981, Carolyn 
launched her professional career at the 
Grant County Library and next served 
as director at the Saline County Li-
brary. She held this position until she 
started with the Arkansas State Li-
brary in 1993, where she served in var-
ious positions, including deputy direc-
tor in the library development unit be-
fore being selected as State librarian in 
2005.

ments of the Arkansas library system

June 22, 2020 
during her tenure as State librarian 
testify to her dedication and influen-
tial direction. Under her guidance, our 
libraries 
adapted 
emerging 
tech-
nologies. She helped facilitate the 
transition to digitization, expanding 
digital programs such as the Traveler 
Statewide Digital Resource Program 
and establishing the Arkansas Digital 
Library Consortium in 2018. She also 
oversaw the relocation of the agency 
and its collection of books, State and 
Federal documents, Library for the 
Blind materials, and other documents. 
Carolyn is known for having an 
unrivaled and encompassing knowledge 
of libraries, as evidenced by her in-
volvement in both State and national 
professional library associations. The 
list of such organizations is lengthy 
and includes the Arkansas Library As-
sociation, American Library Associa-
tion, the Association for Rural and 
Small Libraries, and Chief Officers of 
State Library Agencies. 
I thank Carolyn for her contributions 
to Arkansas during her career of dedi-
cated service, guidance, and support of 
our public libraries and library serv-
ices. She will be missed, but I am con-
fident she will enjoy her time in retire-
ment.∑

PORTING THE GOALS OF INTER-
NATIONAL 
MYALGIC 
ENCEPHALOMYELITIS/CHRONIC 
FATIGUE 
SYNDROME 
AWARE-
NESS DAY 
Mr. MARKEY (for himself, Ms. COL-
LINS, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Ms. STABENOW, 
Mr. BOOKER, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Ms. HAR-
RIS, Ms. WARREN, Ms. SINEMA, and Mr. 
CRAMER) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 633 
Whereas the National Academy of Medi-
cine 
(referred 
to 
in 
this 
preamble 
as 
‘‘NAM’’), formerly known as the Institute of 
Medicine, 
has 
found 
that 
Myalgic 
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic 
Fatigue 
Syn-
drome (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘ME/ 
CFS’’) is ‘‘a serious, chronic, complex, and 
systemic disease that frequently and dra-
matically limits the activities of affected pa-
tients’’; 
Whereas, in the past, outbreaks of viruses, 
including outbreaks of coronaviruses, have 
triggered an increase in ME/CFS-like symp-
toms in individuals infected by those viruses; 
Whereas— 
(1) between 836,000 and 2,500,000 individuals 
of all ages, races, and sexes in the United 
States are believed to be afflicted with ME/ 
CFS, and millions of additional individuals 
are afflicted by ME/CFS worldwide; and 
(2) the vast majority of individuals with 
ME/CFS are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed; 
Whereas ME/CFS is approximately 4 times 
more prevalent in women than in men; 
Whereas ME/CFS is a chronic disease with 
no known cure and leaves 1⁄4 of individuals 
with ME/CFS housebound or bedbound for 
extended periods of time; 
Whereas between 50 and 75 percent of indi-
viduals with ME/CFS cannot work or attend 
school; 
Whereas, in the United States, the eco-
nomic toll of ME/CFS is $51,000,000,000 per 
year, including as much as $14,000,000,000 in 
medical costs and $37,000,000,000 in lost pro-
ductivity; 
Whereas the cause of ME/CFS is unknown, 
there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, and 
there is no treatment for ME/CFS approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration; 
Whereas NAM has noted a ‘‘paucity of re-
search’’ on ME/CFS and that ‘‘more research 
is essential’’; 
Whereas individuals with ME/CFS struggle 
to find doctors to care for them, and ME/CFS 
is included in less than 1⁄3 of medical school 
curricula; 
Whereas, in recognition of the dearth of re-
search on ME/CFS and the profound impact 
that the disease has on individuals with ME/ 
CFS and their loved ones and caretakers, the 
National Institutes of Health is ‘‘committed 
to 
unraveling 
the 
underlying 
biologic 
cause(s) of ME/CFS as swiftly as possible, 
and promoting research that will inform the 
development of effective strategies for treat-
ment and prevention of this devastating con-
dition’’; and 
Whereas, in 2020, May 12 is recognized as 
International ME/CFS Awareness Day: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of International 
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue 
Syndrome Awareness Day; 
(2) recognizes and affirms the commitment 
of the United States to— 
(A) supporting research and medical edu-
cation for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chron-
ic Fatigue Syndrome; and 
(B) promoting awareness among health 
professionals and the public about Myalgic 
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic 
Fatigue 
Syn-
drome; and 
(3) recognizes the continued importance 
of— 
(A) health care professionals and medical 
researchers who care for individuals with 
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue 
Syndrome; and 
(B) individuals who work to discover the 
cause of, and develop and improve the diag-
nosis of, treatments for, and a cure for, 
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue 
Syndrome.

the whistle on fraud and misconduct that 
was harmful to the United States; 
Whereas the Founding Fathers unani-
mously supported the whistleblowers in 
words and deeds, including by releasing gov-
ernment records and providing monetary as-
sistance for the reasonable legal expenses 
necessary to prevent retaliation against the 
whistleblowers; 
Whereas, on July 30, 1778, in demonstration 
of their full support for whistleblowers, the 
members of the Continental Congress unani-
mously passed the first whistleblower legis-
lation in the United States that read: ‘‘Re-
solved, That it is the duty of all persons in 
the service of the United States, as well as 
all other the inhabitants thereof, to give the 
earliest information to Congress or other 
proper authority of any misconduct, frauds 
or misdemeanors committed by any officers 
or persons in the service of these states, 
which may come to their knowledge’’ (legis-
lation of July 30, 1778, reprinted in Journals 
of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789, ed. 
Worthington C. Ford et al. (Washington, DC, 
1904–37), 11:732); 
Whereas whistleblowers risk their careers, 
jobs, and reputations by reporting waste, 
fraud, and abuse to the proper authorities; 
Whereas, in providing the proper authori-
ties with lawful disclosures, whistleblowers 
save the taxpayers of the United States bil-
lions of dollars each year and serve the pub-
lic interest by ensuring that the United 
States remains an ethical and safe place; and 
Whereas it is the public policy of the 
United States to encourage, in accordance 
with Federal law (including the Constitution 
of the United States, rules, and regulations) 
and consistent with the protection of classi-
fied information (including sources and 
methods of detection of classified informa-
tion), honest and good faith reporting of mis-
conduct, fraud, misdemeanors, and other 
crimes to the appropriate authority at the 
earliest time possible: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 30, 2020, as ‘‘National 
Whistleblower Appreciation Day’’; and 
(2) ensures that the Federal Government 
implements the intent of the Founding Fa-
thers, as reflected in the legislation passed 
on July 30, 1778 (relating to whistleblowers), 
by encouraging each executive agency to 
recognize National Whistleblower Apprecia-
tion Day by— 
(A) 
informing 
employees, 
contractors 
working on behalf of the taxpayers of the 
United States, and members of the public 
about the legal right of a United States cit-
izen to ‘‘blow the whistle’’ to the appropriate 
authority by honest and good faith reporting 
of misconduct, fraud, misdemeanors, or 
other crimes; and 
(B) acknowledging the contributions of 
whistleblowers to combating waste, fraud, 
abuse, and violations of laws and regulations 
of the United States.

PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
FOURTH 
OF 
JULY, 
AMERICA’S 
BIRTHDAY, AND THE HUNDREDS 
OF BUSINESSES AND WORKERS 
THAT MAKE UP THE FIREWORKS 
INDUSTRY 
Mr. ROUNDS submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 635 
Whereas, on July 3, 1776, Founding Father 
John Adams wrote to Abigail Adams express-
ing his belief that the signing of the Declara-
tion of Independence should be commemo-
rated ‘‘with Pomp and Parade, with Shows, 
Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Il-
luminations from one End of this Continent 
to the other from this Time forward forever 
more’’; 
Whereas, on July 4, 1777, reflecting the vi-
sion of John Adams, fireworks were set off in 
Philadelphia as part of a celebration to com-
memorate Independence Day; 
Whereas throughout our history, Ameri-
cans in cities and towns large and small have 
celebrated the birth of our great Nation, 
with 16,000 fireworks displays on Independ-
ence Day in 2019 alone; 
Whereas an estimated 49 million Ameri-
cans traveled on vacation to these cities and 
towns during the Fourth of July holiday in 
2019; 
Whereas 49 States plus the District of Co-
lumbia allow some or all types of consumer 
fireworks; 
Whereas retail sales of fireworks have sky-
rocketed in recent years; 
Whereas Americans spend more than $1 bil-
lion on fireworks annually, and close to $900 
million is spent on consumer fireworks 
alone; 
Whereas the United States fireworks in-
dustry is committed to promoting the legal 
and safe handling and use of all fireworks; 
Whereas for the first time in over 10 years, 
Mount Rushmore, our Nation’s ‘‘Shrine of 
Democracy’’, will resume using fireworks in 
2020; 
Whereas the fireworks industry serves as a 
livelihood for many small business owners 
and operators across the country; 
Whereas fireworks celebrations are impor-
tant economic drivers for cities and towns 
across the country; and 
Whereas many cities and towns across the 
country are canceling or are considering can-
celing their annual Fourth of July celebra-
tions: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the historic importance of 
fireworks displays in the United States, par-
ticularly in annual Independence Day cele-
brations; 
(2) recognizes that the fireworks industry 
brings joy to communities and neighbor-
hoods across the country and is good for our 
national psyche; 
(3) supports the commitment to bring fire-
works back to our Nation’s ‘‘Shrine of De-
mocracy’’ at Mount Rushmore; and 
(4) urges cities, towns, counties, and other 
municipalities to save the Fourth of July by 
reconsidering postponing or canceling their 
Fourth of July celebrations, so that Ameri-
cans can enjoy our Nation’s birthday while 
adhering to appropriate social distancing 
guidelines.

CELEBRATING LGBTQ+ PRIDE 
MONTH 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to join my LGBTQ+ family, friends, col-
leagues, and constituents in celebrating the 
many hard-earned gains that have been made 
for equality in our nation and around the 
globe. We have come a long way in the last 
several years: from the passage of the Equal-
ity Act in the House last year, to same-sex 
marriage being legalized in twenty-nine coun-
tries, and now the Supreme Court holding that 
the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits sex dis-
crimination, applies to discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and gender identity. 
This Pride Month, as our nation reckons 
with its long history of racism and police vio-
lence, we must remember that the fight for 
LGBTQ+ rights goes hand-in-hand with the 
fight for racial equality. On June 28, 1969 at 
the Stonewall Inn in New York City, the police 
rounded up and arrested LGBTQ patrons and 
forced them into police cars. Fed up with po-
lice harassing and brutalizing the gay commu-
nity, other Stonewall Inn patrons started an 
uprising outside the bar. Among them were 
Marsha P. Johnson, a black drag queen and 
Sylvia Rivera, a Latinx drag queen, both pio-
neering activists who were key figures in re-
sisting police violence that night, alongside 
other transgender and queer activists. The 
LGBTQ+ rights movement as we know it 
today was born out of these brave people re-
sisting police mistreatment. 
This year would have marked the 50th anni-
versary of the Chicago Pride parade, and 51 
years since the Stonewall riots. While we can-
not march and gather this year because of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, we can continue to cel-
ebrate our progress and our shared history in 
the LGBTQ+ community. I’m particularly proud 
of the role my district has in the LGBTQ+ 
community, with the Pride Parade stepping off 
just blocks from my Chicago District office, to 
the historic Andersonville neighborhood, and 
to being the home of so many historical insti-
tutions like the Gerber/Hart Library and Ar-
chives, the Baton Show Lounge, the Test 
Positive Aware Network, and the Leather Ar-
chives and Museum. 
Despite our many advances, LGBTQ+ peo-
ple, and disproportionately Black trans women, 
still face hatred, discrimination, violence, and 
police harassment and brutality around the 
country and globe. Over one-third of Black 
trans women who interact with law enforce-
ment in the U.S. are assumed by police to be 
sex workers, leading to harassment, abuse, 
and mistreatment. Since 2013, about 111 out 
of at least 157 transgender and gender non- 
conforming victims of hate killings have been 
Black trans women. And just last week, we 
lost two Black trans women, Riah Milton and 
Dominique ‘‘Rem’Mie’’ Fells, who were brutally 
murdered. They were the 13th and 14th trans 
women in the U.S. to be killed this year alone. 
And the violence extends to the transgender 
community overall, including right here in Chi-
cago. Last month, Selena Reyes-Hernandez 
was killed by an 18-year old man who shot 
her in her home on the south side of Chicago. 
We will not forget them, and we will continue 
to seek justice, equality, and liberty on their 
behalf. 
This Pride Month we must also remember 
and celebrate Aimee Stephens and Don Zarda 
who passed away before seeing the outcome 
of their nearly decade long case that made it 
all the way to Supreme Court. Aimee, who 
was fired for being transgender, and Don, who 
was fired for being gay, fought relentlessly to 
ensure that LGBTQ+ people can go to work 
as themselves without fear of retaliation. This 
week, in perhaps the biggest LGBTQ+ case in 
U.S. history, the Supreme Court sided with 
Aimee and Don and held that the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 protects LGBTQ+ workers from 
discrimination. Let this victory renew our hope 
and our drive to continue fighting for a world 
where everyone can live freely and authen-
tically. 
My hope for our country this Pride Month is 
that we can reflect on the decades’ long fight 
for LGBTQ+ equality, learn from our mistakes, 
and look forward to righting the wrongs of our 
past. As a proud grandmother of a young 
trans man, and as a Representative in the 
U.S. House, I will continue fighting to ensure 
my grandson and all LGBTQ+ people inherit a 
world that embraces everyone regardless of 
sexuality, gender identity, race, or class. Love 
is love.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND 
MEMORY OF MR. ANDREW JAMES 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and express sad-
ness over the passing of Mr. Andrew James. 
Mr. James was a chronically homeless man 
who spent nearly 20 years suffering on the 
streets, vulnerable and struggling with mental 
illness. He was able to find hope, treatment, 
and housing security through the help of The 
Lord’s Place. The staff that worked with him at 
The Lord’s Place described him as a ‘‘gentle 
soul, showing nothing but kindness to all he 
met, despite being treated unjustly while on 
the streets.’’ 
After receiving assistance through The 
Lord’s Place, Mr. James flourished. He was 
placed in a supportive housing program and 
was connected to mental health care, but it 
was the connection to others that made all the 
difference in his life. He loved others and they 
certainly loved him too. 
Mr. James passed away with dignity, in his 
own home on May 15, 2020. I extend my 
heartfelt condolences to all who were lucky 
enough to know Mr. Andrew James. He will be 
dearly missed.

tors before eventually becoming Chief Patrol 
Agent of the Laredo Sector. As Chief, he was 
responsible for over 86,673 square miles in 
101 counties from the U.S.-Mexico borders to 
the Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas borders. 
Chief Chavez showed strong direction and 
experience as Chief Patrol Agent of the La-
redo Sector. In addition, he also ensured that 
the Laredo Sector was led with honor and in-
tegrity. He developed these leadership quali-
ties and skills over the course of his career 
after serving in a variety of positions including: 
Border Patrol Agent, Senior Patrol Agent, Su-
pervisory Border Patrol Agent, Field Oper-
ations Supervisor, Patrol Agent in Charge, As-
sistant Chief Patrol Agent, Deputy Chief of 
Southwest Border Operations, Deputy Chief 
Patrol Agent for the Tucson Sector, and Chief 
Patrol Agent of Del Rio Sector. 
In addition, Chief Chavez is a graduate of 
Ashford University with a Bachelor of Arts in 
Organizational Management. In addition, he 
completed the Executive Institute at the Uni-
versity of Chicago’s Graduate School of Busi-
ness and the Customs and Border Protection 
Command Leadership Academy. He is also a 
graduate of the National Defense University 
Capstone Program. 
As we move forward, let us take the time to 
appreciate the service of individuals like Chief 
Chavez and all the men and women who risk 
their lives each day to protect our commu-
nities. However, in the words of President 
John F. Kennedy, ‘‘As we express our grati-
tude, we must never forget that the highest 
appreciation is not to utter words, but to live 
by them.’’

RECOGNIZING BELOVED RADIO 
HOST, GRISEL BARAJAS 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to honor and recognize Grisel 
Barajas, a leader in the Hoosier Latino com-
munity who tragically passed away on Sun-
day, June 14, 2020. 
Born in Guadalajara, Mexico, Grisel moved 
to the United States at the age of 10, first to 
Chicago and then to Indianapolis where she 
graduated from North Central High School. 
She faced many difficulties as an immigrant 
and was inspired to practice social work to 
help other families navigate the same hard-
ships and language barriers. After obtaining a 
bachelor’s degree in Social Work and Span-
ish, she decided to change career paths, earn-
ing a master’s degree in Mass Communica-
tions and Media Studies from University of 
Southern Indiana. 
Grisel began her radio career in 2013 when 
she co-hosted ‘‘Soul & Salsa’’ on Magic 98.5 
before returning to Indianapolis in 2015 to be-
come a host for the Continental Broadcast 
Group’s Radio Latina. Grisel also worked as 
an education and communications director for 
the Indiana Latino Institute, mentoring Latino 
high school and college students. In 2018, 
Grisel helped to establish Radio One’s La 
Grande 105.1 radio station, becoming its first 
Program Director and serving as the afternoon 
host for ‘‘El Relajo de La Tarde’’ show. Grisel 
was also a news personality for Telemundo 
Indy. 
Grisel was an important voice for Latinos in 
Indianapolis, helping to inform, entertain and 
encourage the community. She served as a 
frequent master of ceremonies for local non-
profit events, organized yearly toy drives, and 
continued to mentor and inspire high school 
students. During the ongoing COVID–19 pan-
demic, Grisel worked with local organizations 
to help inform the Latino community about 
how to stay safe. 
Grisel is survived by her parents, Genoveva 
and Salvador Barajas, and her sisters. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Grisel Barajas, a dedicated and be-
loved community advocate who will be dearly 
missed by her family, friends and community.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
HISTORIC 
VIR-
GINIA KEY BEACH PARK 
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, the His-
toric Virginia Key Beach Park was established 
on August 1, 1945 as the ‘‘Colored only 
Beach’’ in Miami, Florida. Today, the civic, so-
cial, and environmental characteristics of the 
park hold national, state, regional, and local 
significance in the history of civil rights, high-
lighting the achievements of local African 
American communities and providing an op-
portunity for the public to explore various envi-
ronmental phenomena unique to the park. 
The Historic Virginia Key Beach Park was 
added to the national register of historic 
places in 2002, added to the State of Florida 
Heritage Trail in 2006, included as a major 
stakeholder to the Virginia Key master plan in 
2010, and added to the City of Miami’s His-
toric and Environmental Preservation List in 
2013. In 2006, the Miami City Commission ap-
proved the Virginia Key Beach Park master 
plan, which included the restoration of the 
park and the creation of a museum. The mu-
seum will showcase the history and contribu-
tions of the communities the park has served, 
the natural environment of the park, and the 
creation of a Center for Conflict Resolution 
and Reconciliation. 
The history of the Historic Virginia Key 
Beach Park highlights the contributions of civil 
rights leaders from our communities. Today, 
the park is a model of social engagement op-
portunities through the incorporation of the 
public shoreline, green space, and the various 
amenities on Virginia Key.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEG-
ACY 
OF 
FLORIDA’S 
FIRST 
WOMAN 
SENATE 
PRESIDENT 
GWEN MARGOLIS 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and legacy of my 
dear friend, Florida’s first woman Senate 
President, Gwen Margolis. Gwen was a trail-
blazing figure in Florida and Miami-Dade poli-
tics, who dedicated her life to public service. 
During this time of great sadness and loss, it 
is helpful to reflect on the wonderful life she 
led. Gwen’s reputation for honesty, kindness, 
and generosity made her the loving mother, 
great friend, and respected public official that 
she was. She was an excellent role model, not 
just for people wanting to follow in her foot-
steps, but for everyone in our community. 
Gwen compiled an exemplary record as a 
Miami-Dade County Commissioner, including 
time as that body’s first female chair. She also 
served multiple terms in the Florida legislature. 
Gwen was beloved throughout South Florida 
and will always be remembered for her self-
less dedication to public service. 
Madam Speaker, I extend my heartfelt con-
dolences to Gwen’s family and friends. As we 
honor the life and legacy of Senator Gwen 
Margolis, we will always be grateful for the 
glass ceilings she shattered and her indelible 
mark in history. I pray that her family finds 
comfort during this extremely difficult time. 
She will be dearly missed.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
THREE 
GRADUATES FROM THE KEETON 
FAMILY 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate three phenomenal women in 
the Keeton family who graduated from school 
this year. 
After a successful 20-year career at the 
Johnson Space Center and raising an incred-
ible family of four children, Jasmine Keeton 
graduated with her master’s degree in engi-
neering management. Coincidentally, two of 
her daughters also graduated from college as 
well. Unfortunately, like many people, their 
graduation celebrations were impacted by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Looking to find a way to 
honor her daughters’ hard work, Jasmine 
reached out to the ‘‘Today’’ show to be in-
cluded in a virtual party for 2020 graduates. 
Jasmine was even more surprised when they 
were asked to speak on-air. 
Jasmine’s younger daughter, JoyLynn, grad-
uated from Robert Turner College and Career 
High School and Alvin Community College 
with her associate degree. Her oldest daugh-
ter, Jadean, graduated from Prairie View A&M 
University with a bachelor’s degree in social 
work. This fall, Jadean will begin pursuing her 
master’s degree in social work at the Univer-
sity of Houston and JoyLynn will be continuing 
her education Howard University to pursue a 
career in journalism. Their mom, Jasmine, 
may pursue a doctoral degree in engineering. 
Education lifts people up and helps them 
achieve their God-given potential. American 
education has extended a ladder of oppor-
tunity to help people across the nation and 
from every generation improve their quality of 
life. The Keeton family grabbed hold of that 
ladder, and they’re not done climbing yet. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, congratulations to the 
Keeton women for your scholastic achieve-
ments. Their drive in their educational pursuits 
sets an example for others to follow.

RECOGNIZING 
FIRE 
CHIEF 
AND 
EMERGENCY 
COORDINATOR 
STEVE LANDIN 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career and service of Fire Chief 
and Emergency Management Coordinator, 
Steve Landin. Chief Landin has retired after 
30 years of service as a member of the City 
of Laredo’s Fire Department. 
Chief Landin is an individual who showed 
true leadership and poise under great pres-
sure. Since first becoming emergency man-
agement coordinator in 2005 and eventually 
Fire Chief, he helped lead the City of Laredo 
through three federally declared disasters as 
well as the ongoing pandemic. In addition, de-
spite these difficult circumstances, he also 
managed to be a devoted family man and ex-
ample for his community. 
I have personally worked with Chief Landin 
over the years and witnessed first-hand the 
important work he has done for our area. 
Through his efforts, he helped ensure that 
Laredo’s Fire Department was amongst the 
best in the country. In addition, he has set the 
standard for future fire department leaders. 
Chief Landin’s service to the City of Laredo 
will never be forgotten. He cared deeply about 
the people he was serving and consistently 
showed what it meant to always put the safety 
and well-being of others first. The dedication 
that he showed to us all should be a constant 
reminder of how we should be in our daily 
lives. 
However, Chief Landin’s service to others is 
not over. He will now be working for Webb 
County as its new Emergency Management 
Coordinator. Once again showing his commit-
ment to others and devotion to our community. 
As we move forward, let us take the time to 
appreciate the service of heroes like Chief 
Landin and all the individuals who risk their 
lives each day to keep us safe. However, in 
the words of President John F. Kennedy, ‘‘As 
we express our gratitude, we must never for-
get that the highest appreciation is not to utter 
words, but to live by them.’’

HONORING STEPHEN KONZ 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Stephen Stan-
ley Konz for a life of service to his country, his 
family, and his community. 
Steve was born in Poland on September 
6th, 1926 to Lillian Kwiatkowski and Michael 
Rosinski. As a three-month-old baby he came 
to America through Ellis Island in the arms of 
a teenage mother. He joined the Navy at age 
17 where he served until the war ended in Au-
gust 1945. 
After the war, Steve moved to Republic, 
Washington to teach fifth grade. During this 
time, he raised five children, built a log home, 
and grew a cattle herd. While the log home 
burned in 1978, it was rebuilt with the help of 
friends and neighbors. 
Steve was passionate about politics, advo-
cating for the Constitution, individual freedom, 
property rights, limited government, and the 
right to bear arms. Steve was deeply involved 
in the community as a member of the Kiwanis 
Club, Grange, PTA, local school board, Cattle-
men’s Association, and Washington Farm For-
estry Association. He also served as the man-
ager of the Ferry County Fair, the President of 
the Republic Chamber of Commerce, and a 
district court judge for 14 years. 
A captivating storyteller, Steve often had lis-
teners laughing and crying. In 1994, at age 
75, Steve drew up plans to convert his ranch 
into a guest lodge. The foundation was com-
pleted in 2000, and for the next 17 years 
Steve could be seen with a smile on his face, 
working every day from dawn to dusk to com-
plete his dream lodge. 
Steve Konz passed away at age 90 in the 
lodge he built, on the ranch he loved, with 
family at his side. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful na-
tion and Washington’s Fifth Congressional 
District may we rise to remember Steve and 
his legacy. His service and passion will inspire 
generations to come.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JOE 
‘‘CAPTAIN’’ HYDE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI

Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Retired 
Captain Joe Hyde, who passed away in his 
home on June 10 surrounded by family. 
Captain Hyde, a 1965 graduate of Inde-
pendence High School, served with the 
Southaven Police Department for 31 years. He 
was one of the fast investigators and first 
SWAT team members to serve the Depart-
ment and continued to serve the Senatobia 
Police Department for another 10 years. Cap-
tain Hyde, also a part of the Mississippi Na-
tional Guard, was one of only two officers to 
receive the Department’s Medal of Honor, its 
highest commendation, for valor, combat, and 
life saving skills. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Bar-
bara; his stepchildren: Kim Mitchell (Ricky), 
John Parker (Christy), and Christy McGregor 
(Kevin); as well as many friends and extended 
family members. 
I am thankful for Joe ‘‘Captain’’ Hyde’s serv-
ice to Mississippi. He will be greatly missed by 
his family, community, and all whom he en-
countered.

IN MEMORY OF EARNESTINE 
‘‘WARNET’’ DAVIS 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Earnestine Davis, a beloved resident 
of the city of Detroit. 
Earnestine Warnet Davis was born on Janu-
ary 18, 1951 to the late Dulcy B. Smith and 
Hubert Lee Lockett in Detroit, Michigan. 
Earnestine, affectionately known as ‘‘Warnet’’ 
or ‘‘Net’’, was the eldest of five children. She 
embraced the role of leader and ‘‘big sister,’’ 
often helping her mother with caring for her 
younger brothers and sisters. 
Upon graduating from Detroit’s Mumford 
High School, Warnet moved to Miami, Florida 
to live with her late father, Hubert Lockett, and 
his wife, Dale Lockett, to attend Miami Dade 
Community College. In 1969, she married the 
love of her life, Michael Davis, Sr., who pre-
ceded her in death. They returned to Detroit to 
focus on raising a family. Warnet and her hus-
band were blessed with five beautiful children: 
Desmond Michelle, Michael, Dulcy Marquita, 
Leigh Christine, and Robert Trevor-Blair Davis. 
Determined and strong-willed, Warnet did 
not let the challenge of raising a large family 
deter her from accomplishing her life’s goal of 
becoming a nurse. After the passing of her 
husband Michael, Warnet reenrolled in col-
lege. Focused and driven, Warnet juggled 
raising her children with long hours of study 
and hard work to realize her dream. In 1986, 
Warnet graduated with two degrees and with 
Honors from the distinguished Nursing Pro-
gram at Highland Park Community College. 
Warnet’s passion for the healing arts drove 
her to focus on passing her state licensing 
exams to obtain her professional licensing to 
become a License Practical Nurse (LPN) and 
Registered Nurse (RN). Succeeding in her 
goal, Warnet enjoyed a long career in nursing, 
specializing as a psychiatric care nurse at-
tending to those with mental illness. Her love 
for her career was evident to all who knew 
her. 
Even while managing a busy career, Warnet 
made the most of her time spent with family. 
She was known as the life of the party and 
took joy in organizing large family gatherings 
at her home. She held a keen appreciation for 
the preciousness of life and always went out 
of her way to bring family together. This sensi-
bility extended into Warnet’s strong spiritual 
life. She served as a deaconess at Park 
United Presbyterian Church in Highland Park, 
Michigan for many years, where she orga-
nized numerous community events. 
Please join me in tribute to Earnestine 
Warnet Davis, a generous soul who will be 
missed by her family and community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COVID–19 
HOSPITAL 
LOAN 
FORGIVENESS 
ACT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the COVID–19 Hospital Loan Forgive-
ness Act to provide immediate, vitally needed 
relief to hospitals and health care providers 
who are under water as a result of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Our nation’s hospitals have invested heavily 
to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic. They 
canceled tens-of-thousands of elective sur-
geries and non-emergent patient tests at the 
government’s request to help ensure adequate 
hospital capacity, preserve gear and equip-
ment, and reduce the risk of unnecessary pa-
tient spread. This major shift has put some of 
America’s hospitals on the brink of financial 
disaster.

Without further support, hospitals will face 
another financial crisis just months from now 
as the government begins to withhold Medi-
care payments for services provided after the 
pandemic fades and until the loans are repaid. 
While the $175 billion provider grant program, 
designed to provide support to all providers, is 
helpful, much more support is needed, 
This legislation will provide Medicare Accel-
erated and Advance Payments loan forgive-
ness to ensure the additional financial support 
hospitals and other providers direly need. For-
giveness would be for health care related ex-
penses or lost revenues that are directly attrib-
utable to coronavirus. And, just like the re-
quirement in the provider grant program, pro-
viders electing to have their advance payment 
loans forgiven would be obligated to abstain 
from balance or surprise billing any patient for 
COVID-related treatment. 
The bill outlines: forgiveness would be for 
health care related expenses or lost revenues 
that are directly attributable to COVID–19, pro-
viders electing to have their advance payment 
loans forgiven would be obligated to abstain 
from balance billing any patient for COVID-re-
lated treatment, and criteria for transparency 
and accountability of the loan forgiveness, in-
cluding no executive compensation. 
Hospitals across my district have shared 
that in the absence of more financial support, 
including this forgiveness, it is possible some 
hospitals will be forced to close or significantly 
scale back operations. This would be a tragic 
consequence, especially if the country is hit 
with another round of the viral epidemic in the 
near future. I thank my colleague and fellow 
Ohioan Representative BOB GIBBS for his bi-
partisan work on this, and our growing list of 
bipartisan cosponsors—we look forward to 
working with the Senate to further action on 
hospital loan forgiveness.

Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Students and parents were caught off-guard

the school year in March due to the 
coronavirus. Many worried that their students 
would not experience their last days of kinder-
garten. However, the staff at Marek Elemen-
tary came up with a creative way to stay safe 
while celebrating its younger learners: a drive- 
by parade. 
The Marek Elementary staff held the parade 
so that the students had a fun way to say 
goodbye to their kindergarten year without 
going inside the building. Music, decorated 
cars and costumes filed in outside of the 
school to let students know the pandemic 
would not stop their graduation. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I thank the staff of 
Marek Elementary for making sure these stu-
dents were able to celebrate moving onto first 
grade. Congratulations to the kindergarten stu-
dents of Marek Elementary for finishing their 
kindergarten year.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
GEORGE 
WASH-
INGTON BIGGS 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 95th birthday of George 
Washington Biggs, and recognize his service 
as a veteran of Army Air Corps and Air Force. 
As a Tuskegee Airman and recipient of the 
Congressional Gold Medal, he is an exem-
plary American and Arizonan to whom we all 
owe a debt of gratitude. 
A native of Nogales, Arizona, Mr. Biggs 
joined the Army Air Corps in 1944 and trained 
at the Tuskegee Institute, the all-black flight 
training school in Alabama. He was one of two 
Arizonans to graduate from the program. After 
training during World War II, Mr. Biggs re-en-
listed in the Army Air Corps as a non-commis-
sioned officer and subsequently received di-
rect commission as an officer in the newly 
formed United States Air Force. He went on to 
achieve the rank of major and flew B–47 and 
B–52 bombers in the Korean and Vietnam 
wars. 
Since retiring from the military, Mr. Biggs 
has lived and worked in Nogales for the U.S. 
Customs Service. He has raised a family and 
since retired. In 2007, Mr. Biggs and other 
Tuskegee Airmen received the Congressional 
Gold Medal, the highest civilian recognition 
awarded by Congress, for the group’s ‘‘unique 
military record that inspired revolutionary re-
form in the Armed Forces.’’ 
I believe that Mr. Biggs’ character and ac-
tions truly embody what it means to serve 
one’s country. Not only did he fly in multiple 
wars, he rose above expectation and obliga-
tion as a pilot and an officer. In addition to his 
time in the Army Air Corps and Air Force, his 
integrity, modesty, and principled character 
are values that we can all learn from and 
should strive to emulate. 
I would like to express my personal appre-
ciation for the service of George Washington 
Biggs, and my hopes that he has a happy 
95th birthday.

IN RECOGNITION OF RALPH 
BUNCHE HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the great history of 
Ralph Bunche High School in King George 
County, Virginia. As one of the first African- 
American schools to receive equitable con-
tributions in its funding, Ralph Bunche High 
set the standard for our nation in addressing 
racial inequality. 
At the time of Ralph Bunche High School’s 
inception, America was still under the wing of 
the discriminatory Jim Crow laws. It was a 
somber period where African-Americans were 
treated unjustly and were not afforded equi-
table opportunities. Moreover, school segrega-
tion made it such that African-American stu-
dents were not sufficiently supported in terms 
of decent provisions in technology, infrastruc-
ture, and even quality of education. 
Finally, on July 29, 1948, Civil Action 631 
set the stage for the construction of Ralph 
Bunche High School and provided much-need-
ed relief for the students that attended the 
school. Just like other prominent civil rights 
leaders, the plaintiffs for this case faced the 
same dangers from radical segregationists. 
Nevertheless, the brave plaintiffs, composed 
of pupils and concerned parents, persevered 
and provided a great service to their commu-
nity by advocating for equal financial distribu-
tion for African-American students. 
The construction of Ralph Bunche High 
School was a landmark event for King George 
County. The school’s namesake has a note-
worthy history in serving both his community 
and country. For instance, his steadfast efforts 
in achieving the 1949 Armistice Agreements 
between the Arab states and Israel culminated 
in his award for the Nobel Peace Prize in 
1950. In addition, during the Civil Rights 
Movement, Dr. Bunche played a significant 
role by participating in iconic events, like the 
1963 March on Washington. 
To sum up, the legacy of Ralph Bunche 
High School lives as strong today as it did in 
1949. Among the first cases to be brought for-
ward, Civil Action 631 begun a series of cases 
that ultimately led to the integration of African- 
American students nationwide and mandated 
that the latter receive equitable educational 
support. Having the school named after Dr. 
Bunche proved highly commendable and the 
school’s designation as a State and National 
Historic Landmark was well-deserved. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in remembering the history of 
Ralph Bunche High School, the heroes that 
participated in its birth and those who continue 
the legacy to preserve educational equality.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JASON 
TERRELL 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Jason 
Terrell, who passed away on Tuesday, June 
9, after a long battle with cancer. 
Jason was born on July 10, 1974, in 
Indianola, Mississippi. Shortly after graduating 
high school, Jason joined the United States 
Marine Corps and fought our nations enemies 
during Operation Restore Hope Somalia. He 
went on to obtain the rank of Corporal, and 
later joined the Mississippi Highway Patrol. 
Jason not only patrolled Mississippi highways, 
but also served as an expert marksman for 
the Mississippi Highway Patrol SWAT team. 
When Sargent First Class Terrell was not pa-
trolling Mississippi highways, he was hunting, 
fishing, or worshipping at First Baptist Church 
of Vardaman. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Tara 
Winter Terrell; daughter, Maddie Terrell; moth-
er, Beverly Charlotte Mitchell; step-father,

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
SEVEN 
LAKES 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
PRESS 
STAFF FOR FINISHING STRONG 
IN THE FACE OF A GLOBAL PAN-
DEMIC 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 22, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Seven Lakes High School 
press staff on their hard work and dedication 
in completing their school yearbook amid the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
With schools being closed due to the 
coronavirus pandemic, it would have been 
easy for the Seven Lakes High School press 
staff to stop working on their yearbook and 
final newspaper edition until they were certain 
what would happen with the rest of their 
school year. Yet these incredible students re-
fused to let COVID–19 stop them. When they 
realized that the coronavirus would bring their 
school year to an early end, these students 
turned lemons into lemonade. 
Using video conferencing software to host 
meetings, the Seven Lakes High School press 
staff would regularly pitch stories and develop 
plans to complete their yearbook and final 
newspaper. Often, these students would con-
tinue working on it after the school day had 
ended. Thanks to their hard work and perse-
verance, the students of Seven Lakes High 
School will have a record of the memories 
they made during the school year with their 
yearbook and final newspaper edition. 
On behalf of the 22nd Congressional District 
of Texas, I would like to congratulate the 
press staff of Seven Lakes High School for 
completing their work in the face of incredible 
odds. The Katy community is very proud of 
them.
