PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, be with us this evening as 
we reconvene from having honored our 
fallen brother to resume the business 
of the day. In this profound instance, 
we are struck by the mystery that is 
life—that within a few short moments, 
we can move from observing how pre-
cious and precarious one individual’s 
life is, only to return to the routine 
but necessary running of an entire 
country. 
In times like these, we come to truly 
value the people with whom we serve 
and the paths we trod together. We 
pray with the Psalmist that You would 
teach us to number our days—to make 
each one count. 
Grant us a heart of wisdom, that 
when we are met with perilous danger, 
we would know Your strength. And 
when we are faced with the tedious du-
ties of a day, at times overwhelmed by 
the futility of our efforts, may we re-
main unwavering in our commitment. 
We pray Your kindness to fall upon 
us, O Lord, that the work of our hands 
would have effect and that our well-in-
tended actions serve Your ultimate 
purpose. May we in all that we encoun-
ter this day and all days, have the faith 
to proclaim, ‘‘the grass withers and the 
flowers fade, but the Word of our God 
endures forever.’’ 
We pray in the strength of Your sov-
ereign name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s

f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BASS) come forward and lead the House 
in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. BASS led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH) and the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Kentucky. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend remarks 
and insert extraneous material into the 
RECORD on H.R. 1868. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today, the House 
meets on the heels of huge milestones 
for our country: more than 180 million 
vaccine shots in Americans’ arms and 
more than 150 million rescue checks in 
Americans’ bank accounts. 
As the resources included in the 
American Rescue Plan continue to 
strengthen our Nation’s fight against 
COVID–19 and deliver critical relief to 
American families, today’s legislation 
will ensure our healthcare providers— 
who have been on the front lines of this 
pandemic—are supported during this 
difficult time. 
Early in the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Congress came together to provide fi-
nancial support to healthcare providers 
by temporarily pausing the sequestra-
tion of the Medicare program created 
by the Budget Control Act of 2011. This 
pause, originally enacted in the CARES 
Act and then further extended in the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2021, was slated to expire on March 31, 
2021. Today’s legislation will extend 
the suspension through the end of this 
year. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased that 
this bill received bipartisan support in 
the Senate, and it is my hope that it 
will receive broad bipartisan support in 
this Chamber as well. 
However, I would be remiss if I did 
not state my disappointment that the 
needed legislative fix to exclude the 
American Rescue Plan from the statu-
tory paygo scorecard was dropped from 
this measure. 
Many of my House Republican col-
leagues supported this bill in its origi-
nal form, which would essentially put 
the American Rescue Plan on equal 
footing with our other COVID relief 
packages and ensure it is treated the 
same as the previous reconciliation bill 
passed by Congress. 
So while today’s action is an impor-
tant step, our work is not done. Next, 
we must enact an additional legislative 
fix to prevent a separate paygo seques-
ter and avert painful and indiscrimi-
nate cuts to Medicare, farm supports, 
social services, resources for students 
and individuals with disabilities, and 
other programs Americans rely on. 
I am committed to passing this bill 
today, and enacting a second sequester 
fix before the end of this session of 
Congress. I invite all my colleagues to 
join me in these important efforts. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the legislation be-
fore us today is clearly a wiser course 
of action than that which my House 
Democrat colleagues pursued just a few 
weeks ago. As a reminder, despite 
House Republicans specifically raising 
the concern over the risk House Demo-
crats were taking with the healthcare 
of America’s seniors, our Democrat col-
leagues first dismissed the fact that 
their recently enacted $1.9 trillion bail-
out bill would lead to billions in cuts 
to Medicare. Then, after passing their 
bill, and after the President signed into 
law a plan that would lead to $36 bil-
lion in cuts to Medicare, Democrats 
suddenly felt compelled to acknowl-
edge that fact. 
Unfortunately, when they chose to 
act, Democrats chose a course of action 
that completely failed. I say chose that 
course of action because they could 
have protected America’s seniors and 
offset the impact to the budget by 
adopting the Protect Seniors and Cut 
Waste Act put forward by House Re-
publicans, which would: 
Stop benefits and payments to pris-
oners and illegal immigrants; stop 
funds from the bailout bail for the Na-
tional Endowment for the Arts and Na-
tional Endowment for the Humanities; 
stop special handouts for Federal em-
ployees; and rescind billions in bailouts 
that go to State governments. 
Our Democrat colleagues were un-
willing to accept such a commonsense 
approach. They wanted to simply pre-
tend $1.9 trillion in spending is not 
happening and erase the evidence. 
Thankfully, the Senate, in a bipar-
tisan vote of 90–2, agreed to the bill 
that is before us today—legislation 
that postpones the Budget Control 
Act’s reduction in Medicare spending 
that is otherwise set to begin this 
month. It offsets and achieves those 
savings by extending future funding re-
straints an additional year. 
It avoids a cut to Medicare that is 
smaller than that which is set to occur 
because of the Biden bailout bill, but it 
also does not simply shove under the

rug the cost of the debt-inducing ac-
tions taken by Washington Democrats 
thus far. They will have to deal with 
those actions and their spending. 
In the meantime, we can and should 
act on the legislation before us to do 
what is prudent and possible to protect 
America’s seniors. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a dis-
tinguished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman very much for 
yielding, and I rise in support of the 
Senate amendment to H.R. 1868, an act 
to 
prevent 
direct 
across-the-board 
spending cuts, which would include 
protecting Medicare. 
Madam Speaker, one of the happiest 
days of my life as a Member of the 
United States Congress—and I have 
passed many legislative initiatives—is 
the passing of the American Rescue 
Act. Just in the time that I was in the 
district in the work recess, I was able 
to see the smiles of so many—such as 
our Federally qualified health clinics 
getting almost 50 million to provide 
vaccinations to well-deserved commu-
nities—smiling faces about the Amer-
ican Rescue Act. 
And so the reason why this is an im-
portant initiative is because it retains 
language included by Congress in the 
CARES Act and subsequent legislation 
to address the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Medicare plans and providers are re-
ceiving payment rates at approxi-
mately 2 percent higher than what 
they otherwise could have received 
during this time. The pause in the 
operability of the sequestration was 
slated to expire on March 31, 2021, but 
H.R. 1868 extended the suspension to 
December 30, 2021. We do not want any 
cuts from Medicare, and Democrats 
will not have any cuts in Medicare. 
The Senate amendment to that legis-
lation reduced that time to the end of 
the fiscal year 2021—September 30—but 
I know that even though it has been re-
duced to that, we will extend it because 
we will not have any cuts. I believe the 
American Rescue Plan was desperately 
needed—$20 billion in vaccinations; 
contact tracing and testing; billions of 
dollars for our schools and our teach-
ers; dollars that would help ensure that 
our unemployment is extended, and the 
$1,400. Vaccines in the arms; money in 
people’s pocket. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman from Texas an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Kentucky 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the American Res-
cue Plan will bring $16.7 billion to the 
State of Texas. The lion’s share of $3.3 
billion will come directly to the city of 
Houston and Harris County. 
I thank the gentleman from Ken-
tucky for allowing me to offer a mo-
tion to instruct that indicated that we 
would not stop direct funding from 
going to our local jurisdictions, which 
we fought. And every time I see my 
mayor and local officials, they are 
smiling for that direct funding—$1.4 
billion to smaller jurisdictions like 
Jacinto City and the Houston Inde-
pendent School District getting mil-
lions of dollars. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
particular 
amendment 
is 
important 
because 
Democrats don’t cut Medicare. We are 
standing here today to make sure that 
nothing happens to our seniors and 
Medicare. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, on the Budget, and as the Member 
of Congress for a congressional district that 
has experienced the worst of the COVID–19 
as a public health emergency and economic 
catastrophe, I rise in support of Senate 
Amendment to H.R. 1868. 
I do so because this legislation retains lan-
guage included by Congress in the CARES 
Act and subsequent legislation to address the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Medicare plans and 
providers are receiving payment rates that are 
approximately 2 percent higher than what they 
otherwise would have received during this 
time. 
This pause in the operability of sequestra-
tion was slated to expire on March 31, 2021, 
but H.R. 1868 extended the suspension 
through December 31, 2021; the Senate 
Amendment to that legislation reduced that 
time to the end of fiscal year 2021, or Sep-
tember 30, 2021. 
It is very disappointing that the provision in 
H.R. 1868 passed by House excluding the 
budgetary effects of the American Rescue 
Plan Act of 2021, from the scorecards estab-
lished 
by 
the 
Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go 
(PAYGO) Act of 2010 and preventing across- 
the-board cuts to numerous direct spending 
programs were not included in the amendment 
passed by the Senate. 
But as a member of the Budget Committee, 
I will be working tirelessly with Chairman YAR-
MUTH and my colleagues to ensure that Con-
gress designates as an emergency or other-
wise excludes from the PAYGO scorecard the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to avert 
sequestration. 
Madam Speaker, Congress has never per-
mitted sequestration to affect the Medicare 
trust fund and it certainly will not allow it now, 
just when help is arriving under the American 
Rescue Plan Act to put shots in arms, money 
in pockets, kids in school, and workers back 
on the job. 
It is worthwhile to explain why the American 
Rescue Plan Act is the most transformative 
legislation in more than a half century and 
easily justifies exclusion from sequestration. 
H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act, 
is a landmark, life-saving legislation that will 
provide urgently-needed resources to defeat 
the virus, put vaccines in people’s arms, 
money into families’ pockets, children safely 
back into classrooms, and people back to 
work. 
With tens of millions of Americans infected, 
more than half a million lives lost, over 18 mil-
lion Americans unemployed and millions more 
hungry and food and housing insecure, thanks 
to the work of congressional Democrats in the 
House and Senate and the Biden administra-
tion, at long last the people of the United 
States and my home state of Texas can be 
assured that ‘‘Help Is On The Way.’’ 
In simple terms this life-saving and life-en-
hancing legislation puts vaccines in arms, puts 
money in people’s pockets, puts children safe-
ly back in school, and it will put workers back 
in jobs. 
1. Put Vaccines in Arms: The plan will 
mount a national vaccination program that in-
cludes setting up community vaccination sites 
nationwide and addressing disparities facing 
communities of color. It will also take com-
plementary measures to combat the virus, in-
cluding scaling up testing and tracing, ad-
dressing shortages of personal protective 
equipment and other critical supplies, investing 
in high-quality treatments, and addressing 
health care disparities. 
2. Put Money in People’s Pockets: The plan 
finishes the job on the President’s promise to 
provide $2,000 in direct assistance to house-
holds across America with checks of $1,400 
per person, following the $600 down payment 
enacted in December. The plan will also pro-
vide direct housing assistance, nutrition assist-
ance for 40 million Americans, expand access 
to safe and reliable child care and affordable 
health care, extend unemployment insurance 
so that 18 million American workers can pay 
their bills and support 27 million children with 
an expanded Child Tax Credit and more than 
17 million low-wage workers through an im-
proved Earned Income Tax Credit. 
3. Put Children Safely Back in School: The 
plan delivers $170 billion for education and 
$45 billion for childcare providers. This in-
cludes a $130 billion investment in K–12 
school re-opening and making up for lost time 
in the classroom, with funds that can be used 
for such things as reducing class sizes, modi-
fying spaces so that students and teachers 
can socially distance, improving ventilation, 
implementing more mitigation measures, pro-
viding personal protective equipment and pro-
viding summer school or other support for stu-
dents that help make up lost learning time this 
year. The plan also provides more than $40 
billion for higher education. 
Here is what the American Rescue Plan Act 
means for the State of Texas, Houston, and 
Harris County. 
An estimated $16.7 billion will come to the 
State of Texas. 
The lion’s share of $3.3 billion will come di-
rectly to the City of Houston, and Harris Coun-
ty will receive a similar share of $5.667 billion, 
thanks to a provision in the law I helped se-
cure that created the Coronavirus Local Fiscal 
Recovery Fund and appropriated $45.57 bil-
lion. 
$1.4 billion in direct payments is allocated to 
smaller jurisdiction like Jacinto City. 
Houston Independent School District can 
expect to receive close to $100 million 
($993,198 million to be more precise). 
The law specifically allows this funding to be 
used: 
1. To respond to the pandemic or its nega-
tive economic impacts, including assistance to 
households, small businesses, and nonprofits, 
or aid to impacted industries such as tourism, 
travel, and hospitality; 
2. For premium pay to eligible workers per-
forming essential work (as determined by each

recipient government) during the pandemic, 
providing up to $13 per hour above regular 
wages; 
3. For the provision of government services 
to the extent of the reduction in revenue due 
to the pandemic (relative to revenues collected 
in the most recent full fiscal year); and 
4. To make necessary investments in water, 
sewer, or broadband infrastructure. 
In addition to these funds, Texas will receive 
$100 million out of the newly created $10 bil-
lion Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund for 
‘‘critical capital projects directly enabling work, 
education, and health monitoring, including re-
mote options, in response to the public health 
emergency with respect to the Coronavirus 
Disease. 
Now all that is well and good but let me tell 
you what the American Rescue Plan Act 
means for a hard-working and hard-pressed 
single mother of two children making a modest 
income: 
Stimulus checks: $1,400 × 3 = $4,200, 
Child tax credit: $3,600 (5-year-old) + 
$3,000 (9-year-old) = $6,600. Half of that 
amount will be paid out periodically from late 
July through December; the rest will come as 
a check with next year’s taxes. 
Enhanced unemployment: If the parent be-
comes unemployed in March, she will be eligi-
ble for $300 in aid every week through the last 
week of August. 
Total: $10,800 from stimulus and tax credits, 
plus another $7,500 from 25-weeks of en-
hanced unemployment aid. This individual 
would also receive $318 per week in state un-
employment aid and thousands more from the 
Earned Income Tax Credit. 
Finally, let me discuss briefly the good 
things for the restaurant industry that are in 
the American Rescue Plan Act. 
The law allocates $28 billion in funds to 
devastated food service establishments, in-
cluding bars, and food trucks, and vendors. 
Unlike the Paycheck Protection Program, 
which saddled restaurants with burdensome 
loans if the bulk of the funds were not spent 
on payroll, these restaurant relief dollars are 
grants, plain and simple. 
Grant sizes will generally be determined by 
subtracting lower 2020 pandemic-era receipts 
from higher 2019 gross receipts. 
Over $5 billion will be set aside for smaller 
venues whose annual gross receipts were 
below $500,000, leaving $23.6 billion for ev-
eryone else. 
Grants will be capped at $10 million for res-
taurant groups and $5 million for individual 
venues. 
Publicly traded companies or restaurants 
with more than 20 locations will not be eligible 
to participate in this funding. 
And, for the first 21 days, establishments 
owned by women, veterans, or economically 
and socially disadvantaged groups will be 
prioritized. 
This transformative legislation will also pro-
vide direct housing assistance, nutrition assist-
ance for 40 million Americans, expand access 
to safe and reliable child care and affordable 
health care, extend unemployment insurance 
so that 18 million American workers can pay 
their bills and support 27 million children with 
an expanded Child Tax Credit and more than 
17 million low-wage childless workers through 
an improved Earned Income Tax Credit, which 
will reduce the number of children living in 
poverty in America by 50 percent. 
I want to commend my colleagues and 
House Speaker NANCY PELOSI for her leader-
ship and President Biden for signing into law 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and I 
urge all Members to join me in voting to pass 
the bill before us, the Senate Amendment to 
H.R. 1868, and to redouble our efforts to en-
sure the exclusion of the budgetary effects of 
the American Rescue Plan Act from the score-
cards established by the Statutory Pay-As- 
You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010, thus precluding 
the implementation of direct across the board 
cuts in spending. 
b 1915 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I will just say that Repub-
licans don’t cut Medicare. In fact, the 
Biden bailout bill that was passed cut 
$36 billion a year in Medicare. Yet, the 
Senate Democrats have not done any-
thing in regard to those Medicare cuts 
to seniors in the Biden bailout bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, as 
the gentleman from Missouri men-
tioned early on, this bill passed the 
Senate by a 90–2 margin, and I antici-
pate it will pass the House by a signifi-
cant margin as well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
YARMUTH) that the House suspend the 
rules and concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the bill, H.R. 1868. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 384, nays 38,

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, during this sometimes 
chaotic season, remind our lawmakers 
anew that You will never leave or for-
sake us. Give them the wisdom to pray 
as if work had nothing to do with re-
sults and then to work as if prayer did 
not matter. As our Senators surrender 
life’s crushing blows to Your mercy, 
transform their setbacks into stepping 
stones to abundant faith, hope, and 
joy. Use our lawmakers this day for 
Your glory. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen.

VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIAN 
AMERICANS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over 
the past year, there has been a rising 
tide of violence and discrimination 
against Asian Americans, from shouted 
insults and racial slurs to outright 
physical assaults. 
I have attended a whole bunch of ral-
lies against Asian-American violence 
over the past few weeks. You would be 
heartsick—heartsick—to hear the sto-
ries shared, the fear in the voices of 
Asian-American citizens, and to listen 
to the way they change their daily 
lives to avoid the subway or stay in-
doors most of the day. 
The surge in anti-Asian violence is 
revolting and, sadly, contains the 
echoes of dark chapters in our history 
when Asian Americans were subject to 
widespread bigotry and discrimination. 
The poison of racism has always ex-
isted in America, but unfortunately, 
over the past 4 years, it seems to have 
found new life. There is no question 
that the former President fanned the 
flames of racial bias in our country and 
too often encouraged—let alone dis-
couraged—the vicious slander that con-
nected COVID–19 to the people of Asian 
descent. 
Every day in America, in this 21st- 
century America, Asian Americans fear 
they might be insulted, assaulted, spat 
upon, or even worse. As Americans, we 
must stand up and do something about 
it. The foundation of our pluralistic so-
ciety is that an attack on one group is 
an attack on all of us. So tomorrow the 
Senate will vote on whether to take up 
and debate Senator HIRONO’s anti- 
Asian hate crimes bill, sponsored by 
Representative MENG
in the House. 
This bill is as unobjectionable as it 
could be. It would designate a point 
person at the Justice Department to 
identify hate crimes towards Asian 
Americans related to COVID–19, telling 
Federal law enforcement to make these 
hate crimes a top priority during the 
pandemic. 
This isn’t some kind of ‘‘gotcha’’ leg-
islation. It is not some complex new 
program or appropriation. This is as 
straightforward as it gets. This is legis-
lation our times demand. 
Of course, we are open to strength-
ening the bill. I understand that there 
is an effort underway to add bipartisan 
legislation called the No Hate Act— 
sponsored by Senators BLUMENTHAL 
and MORAN, one Democrat and one Re-
publican—as an amendment, and I fully 
support that effort. 
The Blumenthal-Moran bill would 
provide resources to State and local 
law 
enforcement 
to 
improve 
hate 
crimes reporting, increase training, 
while also improving education to root 
out the bias that fuels these despicable, 
despicable acts. That makes perfect 
sense as a bipartisan amendment to 
Senator HIRONO’s legislation, and I be-
lieve that combating hate against the 
Asian-American community should be 
thoroughly, if not unanimously, bipar-
tisan. 
Congress can send a strong signal in 
one loud, clear voice that these kinds 
of hate crimes will not be tolerated. 
The way to do it is for 60 Senators to 
vote to proceed to the bill tomorrow. I 
sure hope it will be more than 60. Then 
it is my intention to make the first 
amendment to the bill the bipartisan 
No Hate Act, but in order to offer the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1880 
April 13, 2021 
amendment, the Senate must vote to 
proceed with debate on the bill. 
President Biden has called on Con-
gress to swiftly pass Senator HIRONO’s 
legislation and get it to his desk for 
signature as soon as possible. There is 
no good reason the Senate can’t com-
plete the task this week. 
f 
NOMINATION OF POLLY ELLEN 
TROTTENBERG 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now on another mat-
ter, beyond Senator HIRONO’s legisla-
tion, the Senate is also focused this 
week on confirming an impressive slate 
of nominees to the Biden administra-
tion. 
I am especially pleased that in a few 
hours, the Senate will vote to confirm 
Polly Trottenberg to serve as Deputy 
Secretary of Transportation. This is 
great news for New York and great 
news for the country. 
Her credentials are beyond doubt. 
For the last 7 years, she has served as 
New 
York 
City’s 
commissioner 
of 
transportation, managing a transpor-
tation system that helps tens of mil-
lions of people get to and from work, 
connects businesses to customers, and 
brings life to one of America’s largest 
and most visited cities every single 
day. 
Before that, Polly served in the De-
partment 
of 
Transportation 
under 
President 
Obama, 
advising 
policy-
makers and working with stakeholders 
across the country on everything from 
high-speed rail to roads, highways, and 
bridges. 
Of course, her nomination is espe-
cially meaningful to me. Polly served 
for nearly a decade as my legislative 
director and transportation adviser. 
She knows the needs of the country, 
and she knows the needs of New York. 
And a pet project so important to the 
New York Gateway will be well served 
in her capable hands. We will get this 
done. 
Take it from me: Polly has smarts, 
she has savvy, and she has moxie. She 
knows how to work with people of all 
backgrounds to get things done for the 
American people. And there isn’t a mo-
ment to lose. As we work to defeat the 
COVID–19 pandemic and bring our 
economy fully back online, we must 
look ahead to tackle the challenges of 
our time, and on top of the list is fi-
nally getting serious about addressing 
our 
Nation’s 
crumbling 
infrastruc-
ture—a topic that Ms. Trottenberg is 
very familiar with. 
For New York, as I mentioned, this 
means continuing to move the ball for-
ward on projects like Gateway, rebuild-
ing the two rail tunnels under the Hud-
son—perhaps 
the 
most 
important 
transportation infrastructure priority 
in the entire Nation and something I 
have spoken to Ms. Trottenberg and 
Secretary 
Buttigieg 
and 
President 
Biden about regularly. 
But our infrastructure woes extend 
to every city and every State in the 
country. Our roads, bridges, highways, 
airports, public transit, housing, and 
the electric grid are all in need of an 
overhaul. So, too, does our country 
need to invest in the infrastructure of 
the 21st century—broadband internet 
access, 5G, electric vehicles. America 
cannot compete in this century if our 
infrastructure is stuck in the last cen-
tury. 
That is why, in addition to con-
firming important nominees like Ms. 
Trottenberg, the Senate will continue 
to work with the Biden administration 
on a comprehensive infrastructure and 
jobs bill. If there is an issue that ought 
to unite Democrats and Republicans, it 
is putting people to work to update our 
Nation’s infrastructure. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
HONORING OFFICER WILLIAM F. 
EVANS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as 
we speak, for the second time this 
year, a fallen officer of the U.S. Capitol 
Police lies in honor under the Capitol 
dome. 
This morning, Officer Billy Evans 
was welcomed here for a final time by 
grieving comrades and a Senate family 
that is immensely grateful for his life, 
his friendship, and his ultimate sac-
rifice. 
Officer Evans died defending the Cap-
itol, its institutions, and the thousands 
of people who come here to do the peo-
ple’s business. The circumstances of his 
killing remind us of the dangers that 
USCP officers swear, train, and prepare 
to meet whenever they might arise. 
Yet, to that serious task, to his in-
tense responsibilities, Officer Evans 
brought a spirit and strength of char-
acter that leaves us all at the Capitol 
with memories of kindness and friend-
ship. 
Today, I know our colleagues are 
holding Officer Evans and his family he 
leaves behind close in our thoughts and 
our prayers. His sacrifice will not be 
forgotten. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a completely different matter, just 
moments ago, new reporting suggests 
the Biden administration plans to turn 
tail and abandon the fight in Afghani-
stan. 
Precipitously 
withdrawing 
U.S. 
forces from Afghanistan is a grave mis-
take. It is a retreat in the face of an 
enemy that has not yet been van-
quished and abdication of American 
leadership. 
Leaders in both parties, including 
me, offered criticism when the prior 
administration floated the concept of a 
reckless withdrawal from Syria and Af-
ghanistan. Those same voices in both 
parties should be equally concerned 
about the Biden administration’s an-
nouncement today. A reckless pullback 
like this would abandon our Afghan, 
regional, and our NATO partners in a 
shared fight against terrorists that we 
have not yet won. It will also specifi-
cally abandon the women of Afghani-
stan, whose individual freedoms and 
human rights will be imperiled. 
It did not have to unfold like this. 
Today in Afghanistan the fighting is 
borne almost exclusively by our local 
partners. We have successfully solic-
ited more buy-in and more support 
from foreign partners as well. Our 
NATO allies have particularly been 
begging—begging—the United States to 
stay by their side. As a result, there 
was broad political support for a sus-
tainable and residual presence to back-
stop the progress we have made. 
In 2019, Republicans and Democrats 
joined hands to support an amendment 
I authored that cautioned against pre-
cipitous retreats from Afghanistan and 
Syria. A supermajority of Senators 
voted for it. A supermajority of Sen-
ators voted for it. 
That amendment called upon the ad-
ministration—the 
previous 
one—‘‘to 
certify whether conditions have been 
met for the enduring defeat of al Qaeda 
and ISIS before initiating any further 
significant withdrawal of United States 
forces from [Syria or Afghanistan].’’ 
Can President Biden certify that 
right now? We have seen this movie be-
fore, multiple times. Ten years ago, 
when President Obama let politics dic-
tate the terms of our involvement in 
Iraq, those failed decisions invited the 
rise of ISIS. 
It was our hasty abandonment of Af-
ghanistan in the 1990s that allowed the 
Taliban to grab power in a bloody civil 
war and create the safe haven for ter-
rorism that led to September the 11th, 
2001. 
Conflicts do not simply end. They are 
won or they are lost. America and 
American administrations must be in 
the business of winning. Al-Qaida and 
other radical Islamist terrorists have 
not yet been defeated. 
There is no reason to believe the 
Taliban will abandon al-Qaida if we 
leave. We know we cannot conduct ef-
fective 
counterterrorism 
operations 
without presence and partners on the 
ground. 
Foreign terrorists will not leave the 
United States alone simply because our 
politicians have grown tired of taking 
the fight to them. The President needs

to explain to the American people why 
he thinks abandoning our partners and 
retreating in the face of the Taliban 
will make America safer. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
one final matter, $865,000 dollars— 
$865,000. That is roughly the cost of 
every new job the White House claims 
their so-called American Jobs Plan 
would create, $865,000. 
This is how the math shakes out if 
you use the most favorable estimates 
that the Biden administration itself 
prefers. Figures reported by Bloomberg 
News come out to about $865,000 per 
job. Other analyses have found num-
bers actually north of $860,000. 
Here is where the number comes 
from. The White House has tried to 
claim their spending plan would create 
19 million jobs over the next decade. 
That is completely false. The Wash-
ington Post Fact Checker gave Demo-
crats multiple Pinocchios for this false 
claim. 
Nineteen million jobs is one estimate 
of the total number of jobs the entire 
country would add over the next dec-
ade, from all sources—all sources. The 
same estimate says we are on track to 
add more than 16 million of those same 
jobs without the bill. 
So this proposal to tax, borrow, and 
spend $2.25 trillion would only create 
2.6 million new jobs. And remember, 
these are the rosiest—rosiest—best- 
case estimates that the White House 
itself has been pushing. 
Now, I know a whole lot of Kentucky 
entrepreneurs and business owners who 
create more than one job if we gave 
them $865,000 to invest and expand. 
Mr. President, I am sure you rep-
resent a lot of smart people who could 
turn an $865,000 investment into more 
than just one job. 
The awful arithmetic just under-
scores how disappointing the proposal 
is. When the American people think of 
infrastructure, they think of honest-to- 
goodness public works projects that 
truly invest in the public good—things 
that build our Nation’s backbone. And 
when Congress tackles real, tangible 
infrastructure issues in a smart fash-
ion, there is big, broad bipartisan sup-
port. 
The 2015 highway bill, the FAST Act, 
was a huge bipartisan lift that Senator 
INHOFE and former Senator Boxer ham-
mered out together. I was proud to 
play a major role in that accomplish-
ment myself. It was the first full 5-year 
highway bill that Congress had passed 
in 20 years. And it won 83 votes in the 
Senate and about the same percentage 
over in the House. 
Even more recently, in 2018, the Sen-
ate passed America’s Water Infrastruc-
ture Act, 99 to 1—the new investments 
in water infrastructure across the 
country to create jobs, grow the econ-
omy, and ensure that American fami-
lies get the safe drinking water they 
deserve, 99 to 1. 
Just last year, another water infra-
structure package came out of the 
EPW 
Committee 
unanimously 
and 
cleared the Senate in a package that 
passed 92 to 6. 
So there is bipartisan appetite for 
smart infrastructure bills that are 
built the right way. The Senate has 
proven that over and over again. There 
isn’t much appetite for using the word 
‘‘infrastructure’’ to justify a colossal— 
colossal—multitrillion-dollar 
slush 
fund for unrelated bad ideas. 
A Harvard economist and infrastruc-
ture expert says, and listen to this, ‘‘It 
does a bit of violence to the English 
language’’ to call this an infrastruc-
ture proposal. That is a Harvard econo-
mist. 
An expert at Columbia says big 
chunks of the proposal are ‘‘really so-
cial spending, not productivity-enhanc-
ing infrastructure of any kind.’’ 
One political analyst wrote: 
[T]he plan . . . reads like a liberal wish list 
for everything the left has wanted. 
Less than 6—6 percent of the proposal 
goes to roads and bridges, less than 6 
percent. It would send more money to 
just electric cars than it would spend 
on our Nation’s roads, bridges, ports, 
airports, and waterways combined. 
And while this proposal chases every 
green fad, it would also slam our econ-
omy with the largest tax hikes in a 
generation. 
Experts at the Wharton School of 
Business have projected the plan would 
decrease GDP, decrease capital stock, 
and reduce workers’ hourly wages 10, 
20, and 30 years down the road. 
Economists at Rice University re-
cently looked at a similar package of 
Democratic tax hikes and found it 
would lead to a loss of a million jobs 
here in our country over just 2 years. 
Exactly when American workers are 
counting on an economic recovery, 
Democrats want to slap the economy 
with a massive set of tax increases. 
So look, this noninfrastructure ‘‘in-
frastructure’’ plan is cut from the same 
cloth as the Democrats’ nonvoting 
rights ‘‘voting rights’’ bill. 
Both these subjects are ripe for bi-
partisan work. Both are subjects the 
Senate has addressed in the past with 
thoughtful 
compromises 
that 
have 
earned broad support. And both are 
issues where the American people will 
reject a far-left approach that makes 
their lives worse.

GEORGIA 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, over 
the past several weeks, all eyes have 
been on Georgia and the State legisla-
tion that is being considered on voting 
rights of Georgia’s citizens. In response 
to the new voting restrictions the 
State’s Governor signed into law last 
month, American leaders from many 
walks of life responded. It has really 
brought the issue of voter suppression 
to the forefront at the beginning of a 
national debate. 
We are told that hundreds—hun-
dreds—of bill changes and amendments 
are being offered in State legislatures 
across the country, all modeled after 
the Georgia goal, the Georgia outline, 
of reducing the opportunity to vote in 
America. 
If you have a functioning democracy 
where people actually count votes, the 
number of people who show up is as im-
portant as how they vote, and I think 
the people in Georgia have realized 
that with this new approach they are 
taking. There has been a broad con-
demnation of the Georgia voting law, 
and it has inspired a display of unity in 
support of our fundamental right to 
vote across America. It seems that 
some of my Republican colleagues 
would rather silence the law’s critics 
than address the very real issues that 
the law creates. 
Over the recess, the minority leader, 
Senator MCCONNELL, issued a warning 
to the leaders of corporations who were 
voicing their opposition to the Georgia 
law. He said to them: You stay out of 
politics. He apparently did not say 
‘‘Keep your money out of politics’’ be-
cause he has been a fan of the Citizens 
United decision, which gives those 
same corporations not only the oppor-
tunity but the experience of spending 
millions of dollars in every election 
cycle to affect the outcome. 
I appreciate the Republican leader’s 
newfound passion for addressing the in-
fluence of big corporations, but rather 
than silencing leaders in the private 
sector from speaking their minds, 
which is their constitutional right, I 
would invite my Republican colleagues 
to join Democrats in taking more 
meaningful steps to protect our polit-
ical system from corporate overreach. 
They can join us if they wish in sup-
porting the For the People Act, the de-
mocracy defense bill. The For the Peo-
ple Act would limit the influence of 
dark money and special interests in 
our politics, require big money contrib-
utors and special interests to actually 
drop the veil and show us who they are, 
and tighten the rules that affect the 
super PACs. It is a commonsense solu-
tion for protecting every American’s 
First Amendment right to free speech, 
and it would level the playing field of 
the political system so that everybody 
has an equal say. 
I would also invite my Republican 
colleagues to revive the bipartisan 
spirit of the Voting Rights Act. I can 
remember a time when renewal of the 
Voting Rights Act was a virtually 
unanimous bipartisan effort. Unfortu-
nately, that changed, and the Supreme 
Court decision didn’t make it any easi-
er. So we are trying with the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
to return to the days of bipartisanship 
in addressing the issue of race and poli-
tics. It is especially important given 
the scourge of voter suppression laws 
we have seen in State legislatures 
across the country, Georgia being the 
most recent example. 
This new Georgia law isn’t new at 
all. It emerges from the playbook that 
is over 120 years old. It goes all the way 
back to the 1890s, when Reconstruction 
was followed by the Jim Crow era in 
the South, with the creation of some-
thing known as the Mississippi Plan. 
Historian Dr. Carol Anderson, who 
teaches at Emory University, has re-
ferred to the Mississippi Plan, a tem-
plate of State law, as ‘‘a dizzying array 
of poll taxes, literacy tests, under-
standing clauses, newfangled voter reg-
istration rules, and ‘good character’ 
clauses—all intentionally racially dis-
criminatory but dressed up in the gen-
teel garb of bringing ‘integrity’ back to 
the voting booth.’’ 
A politician who sought to replicate 
the Mississippi Plan in the State of 
Virginia noted that their goal—he was 
very blunt in what he said—noted their 
goal was to ‘‘[eliminate] every [Black] 
voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, 
without materially impairing the nu-
merical strength of the white elec-
torate.’’ 
Today’s voter restrictions might not 
involve poll taxes, literacy tests, or 
counting the number of beans in a jar, 
but like the laws passed during the Jim 
Crow era, Georgia’s new voting law is a 
deliberate effort to suppress voters, 
particularly voters of color. There is no 
other way to describe it when the law 
includes provisions that make it harder 
for Georgians to vote. 
Let me give you some examples. I 
read an article last week in the New

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1883 
April 13, 2021 
York Times, April 11. Nick Corasaniti 
and Reid Epstein did an analysis, page 
by page, of what the Georgia law would 
do, and it was pretty clear why they 
did it. President Biden won Georgia by 
just 11,779 votes—11,779—out of 5 mil-
lion. 
The new law that has been proposed 
and has been signed by the Governor of 
Georgia will curtail ballot access for 
voters in booming urban and suburban 
counties, home to many Democratic 
voters. 
Another provision makes it a crime— 
a crime—to offer water to voters wait-
ing in line. Of course, those waiting in 
line tend to be in densely populated 
communities 
and 
largely 
minority 
communities. 
Some of the things that the Georgia 
law will do: 
Voters will now have less time to request 
absentee ballots. 
Georgia has cut by more than half the pe-
riod during which voters can request an ab-
sentee ballot, from . . . six months . . . to 
less than three. 
This will most certainly reduce the num-
ber of people [seeking] absentee ballots and 
the number of people who actually vote. In 
the last Presidential election— 
And this is the key sentence that defines 
the goal of the Georgia legislation. 
In the last Presidential election, 1.3 mil-
lion Georgians—about 26 percent of the 
state’s electorate—voted with absentee bal-
lots. Of those who returned absentee ballots 
last year in 2020, 65 percent voted for [Joe] 
Biden and 34 percent chose Donald J. Trump. 
Do you understand why the Repub-
lican legislature wants to put an end to 
the absentee ballot? 
The shorter window will limit opportuni-
ties for get-out-the-vote efforts and put 
strain on new local election boards, which 
. . . have less time to process ballots. 
There are strict new ID requirements for 
absentee ballots. 
Previously, Georgia law required voters to 
simply sign their absentee ballot applica-
tions. Now they . . . have to provide a num-
ber from a driver’s license or an equivalent 
state-issued identification. This is virtually 
certain to limit access. 
It is now illegal [under the new Georgia 
law] for election officials to mail out absen-
tee ballot applications to all voters. 
When the coronavirus pandemic hit last 
year, Georgia’s [Republican] secretary of 
state, Brad Raffensperger, . . . mailed absen-
tee ballot applications to every registered 
voter in the state ahead of its June primary. 
This led to absentee voting by record num-
bers of Georgians. 
When Mr. Raffensperger didn’t mail appli-
cations again for the general election, sev-
eral local government agencies did so, par-
ticularly in Georgia’s large urban counties. 
This is a move that is now being 
made illegal by the law created by the 
legislature and signed by Governor 
Kemp. 
With the loss of automatically mailed ap-
plications, some voters will invariably not 
request a ballot, since the application served 
as a reminder to people that were eligible to 
vote. 
Keep in mind, it wasn’t the ballot 
that was sent without solicitation; it 
was an application that had to be re-
turned by the voter before they actu-
ally received the ballot. It was a re-
minder, one that the Georgia legisla-
ture would like to drop. 
Speaking of dropping, ‘‘drop boxes 
still exist for absentee ballots . . . but 
barely.’’ 
For the 2020 election in Georgia, there were 
94 drop boxes across the four counties that 
make up the core of metropolitan Atlanta: 
Fulton, DeKalb— 
They pronounce it ‘‘DeKab’’; we call 
it ‘‘DeKalb.’’ 
—and Gwinnett. 
The new law limits the same 4 coun-
ties to a total of 23 drop boxes, from 94 
to 23. And it won’t just be fewer drop 
boxes to deposit your ballot. ‘‘Instead 
of 24-hour access outdoors, the boxes 
[are] placed indoors at government 
buildings and early-voting sites and 
will thus be unavailable for voters to 
drop off their ballots’’ in the evening 
and nonbusiness hours, which means 
more reliance on mail and the uncer-
tainty of that. 
With mobile voting centers—as they 
say in the New York Times, think 
about ‘‘an RV where you can vote’’— 
‘‘more than 11,200 people voted at the 
two vehicles at Fulton County in the 
last election.’’ These vehicles traversed 
the county during voting periods, effec-
tively bringing polling sites to people. 
‘‘Georgia has now outlawed this prac-
tice.’’ 
Under the Georgia law, early voting 
has expanded at a lot of small counties 
but not the most populous ones. The 
strict rules will affect Georgians who 
actually work traditional hours for a 
living. They will have less flexible 
schedules and fewer opportunities to 
vote. 
I spoke to you about the single great-
est outrage: 
Offering food and water for voters waiting 
in line now risks [criminal] misdemeanor 
charges. 
Long lines for voting in Georgia are an un-
fortunate reality, and are often found in the 
poor, densely populated communities that 
tend to vote Democratic. During the primary 
election last June, when temperatures hov-
ered above 80 degrees with high humidity, 
multiple voting locations across the State 
had lines in which voters waited more than 
two hours. 
Now they will be denied access to 
water and food. 
If you go to the wrong polling place [under 
the new Georgia law], it will be . . . harder 
to vote. 
It put strict requirements there. 
If election problems arise, a common oc-
currence, it is now more difficult [even in 
court] to extend voting hours. 
With a mix of changes to vote-counting, 
high-turnout elections will probably mean 
long, long waits for results. 
And we remember what happened 
last year when, during that period of 
calculating, President Trump went to 
town with all sorts of bizarre theories 
rejected by scores of courts as to voter 
fraud that never was found. 
Election officials can no longer accept 
third-party funding, (a measure that nods to 
rightwing conspiracy theories) [that Presi-
dent Trump is also peddling]. 
With an eye toward voter fraud, the state 
attorney general [manages] an election hot-
line. 
The Republican-controlled legislature has 
more control over State Election Board. 
The secretary of state, for his audac-
ity in challenging Trump’s vote fraud 
theories, has been officially removed as 
a voting member of the State election 
board by the legislature in Georgia. 
The GOP-led legislature is empowered to 
suspend county election officials. 
The bottom line is this: The Geor-
gians didn’t waste any time taking a 
look at the voting results where they 
lost two Senate seats for the first time 
in history and decided that they had to 
change the rules. Too many voters 
showed up, the wrong voters, so they 
decided to change the rules and make 
it more difficult for those, particularly 
minority, voters who wanted to come 
and express themselves by the right to 
vote. 
So the question now is, What are we 
going to do about it? Well, the a local 
chamber 
of 
commerce, 
Coca-Cola, 
Delta Air Lines, and others have made 
it clear that this is an outrage. It is 
one that we shouldn’t countenance or 
accept in the 21st century. 
This, unfortunately, was an exercise 
in the 19th century to reenslave Afri-
can Americans after the Civil War. 
Sadly, vestiges of that continued, right 
up until the 1960s when the new Civil 
Rights Act ended up banning some of 
the most outrageous conduct that 
came out of the Jim Crow era. 
Now the Republican Party nation-
ally, the Georgia Republican Party, the 
Governor, and the legislature have de-
cided to return to those days. What a 
sad commentary it is on Mr. Lincoln’s 
Republican Party. 
It was embarrassing enough as a 
Democrat to realize that the earliest 
stages of Jim Crow were created, con-
ceived, and enforced by the Democrats 
of their day. For the Republicans, they 
fought that effort, as they should, in 
the name of Lincoln and what he 
brought to their party nationally. Now, 
today, the tables have turned 180 de-
grees. It is the Democrats who are try-
ing to bring to the public’s attention 
what is happening in Georgia and in 
other States. It is sad that the Repub-
licans have decided that the only way 
to win an election is to control the 
vote, that their ideas can’t be sold any-
more to voters across this country. 
BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH WEEK 
Madam President, no community in 
America has been spared from the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Nationwide, we 
have lost nearly 570,000 mothers, fa-
thers, grandparents, neighbors, and 
friends. In Illinois, the number is 
21,000. 
Like so many other diseases and 
health conditions, the pandemic has in-
flicted disproportionate harm on com-
munities of color: Black Americans, 
Native Americans, and members of the 
Latinx community. Sadly, these dis-
parities come as no surprise. America 
has a long history of medical inequal-
ity. From premature births to pre-
mature deaths, people of color suffer 
disproportionately in America’s trou-
bled health system. People of color in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1884 
April 13, 2021 
America suffer more chronic and acute 
health conditions; they are likely to go 
without needed medical care; and they 
have shorter life expectancies. The rea-
sons for the disparities are many, but 
they 
include 
access 
to 
affordable 
healthcare, inadequate research, and 
too few healthcare professionals of 
color. 
Martin 
Luther 
King, 
Jr., 
called 
healthcare inequality the most shock-
ing and inhumane form of injustice. 
Far too often, this inequality begins 
even before birth. It should shock the 
conscience of America—one of the 
wealthiest nations on Earth—that we 
have one of the poorest records on the 
globe for maternal health. 
Think of this: The United States is 1 
of only 13 nations in the world wherein 
the maternal mortality rate—the death 
of mothers—is worse now than it was 25 
years ago. How is that possible? Every 
year in America, nearly 1,000 women 
die from pregnancy-related complica-
tions, and 70,000 others suffer near fatal 
complications as a result of pregnancy. 
Now think of this: Women of color in 
the United States are two to three 
times more likely than White women 
to die as a result of pregnancy. In Illi-
nois, sadly, that number is six times 
more likely. What makes these mater-
nal deaths even more tragic is that an 
estimated 60 percent—more than half 
of them—are preventable. 
I have given much thought to this 
and have spoken with real experts, 
which is why ROBIN KELLY—the Con-
gresswoman from Illinois—and I joined 
with Senator DUCKWORTH and a number 
of other Democratic Senators in intro-
ducing legislation to decrease Amer-
ica’s rates of maternal sickness and 
death, especially among new mothers 
of color. We call our measure the 
MOMMA Act. 
One of the major provisions of this 
legislation is a requirement that Med-
icaid provide health coverage for new 
moms for a full year post-pregnancy in-
stead of just 60 days, which it currently 
is. Congresswoman KELLY and I worked 
hard to get a modified version of this 
provision in the American Rescue Plan, 
President Biden’s singular achieve-
ment in his first few weeks in office. 
Thanks to the law, States now have the 
option to expand their Medicaid pro-
grams for new mothers for the next 5 
years. 
Making sure that new moms have 
health coverage for a full year post- 
pregnancy will go a long way toward 
catching, preventing, and treating po-
tentially 
life-threatening 
conditions 
and problems. This is critical because, 
in some States—even in my State of Il-
linois—nearly 60 percent of pregnancy- 
associated deaths occur between 43 and 
364 days postpartum. 
Well, there is good news to report 
today. While we are still working to 
pass the MOMMA Act, the State of Illi-
nois pursued another avenue for ex-
panding Medicaid coverage for new 
moms. For over a year, Illinois has 
been seeking a Medicaid section 1115 
waiver 
to 
allow 
Medicaid-eligible 
women in our State to keep their 
health coverage for a year after their 
pregnancies. 
Representatives KELLY, UNDERWOOD, 
Senator DUCKWORTH, and I have been 
leading letters and championing this 
effort from our State, and, this week, I 
am happy to announce that the Biden- 
Harris administration granted that 
waiver, making Illinois the very first 
State 
in 
the 
Nation 
to 
extend 
postpartum Medicaid coverage for new 
moms. This will ensure access to vital 
health services, help to promote better 
birth outcomes, reduce the rate of ma-
ternal sickness and death in my home 
State, and, I hope, set the stage as a 
model for other States to follow. 
I can think of no better way to honor 
this year’s Black Maternal Health 
Week than to support State efforts to 
expand Medicaid healthcare to new 
moms. Another way would be to pass 
Senator BOOKER’s 2021 Black Maternal 
Health Week resolution, which I am 
proud to cosponsor. 
As poet Maya Angelou told us, we 
cannot change the past, but when we 
know better, we must do better. We 
now know that we can do better to pro-
tect the lives of pregnant women and 
newborn babies, and I am pleased that 
my State of Illinois will be part of 
leading that effort. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Madam President, today, in Chicago, 
at the Lurie Children’s Hospital—one 
of our best—little 1-year-old Kayden 
Swann is in critical condition, clinging 
to life in the pediatric intensive care 
unit. 
Last week, at 11 a.m., on a Tuesday 
morning on Lake Shore Drive—one of 
the busiest thoroughfares in the city— 
1-year-old Kayden was shot in the head 
while riding in the backseat of a car. 
He was an innocent victim hit in a road 
rage shooting. 
As we pray for Kayden’s recovery, as 
we express gratitude for the medical 
workers who are working around the 
clock to keep him alive, we have to ask 
ourselves a basic question: When it 
comes to this sickening gun violence 
that happens every day in our country, 
what are we going to do? Give up or 
stand up? 
On March 23, I held a hearing on gun 
violence in our Judiciary Committee. 
There was a mass shooting spree that 
killed eight people in Atlanta, GA, on 
the day I announced the hearing. Then 
there was a mass shooting in Boulder, 
CO, that killed 10 people the night be-
fore the hearing. Others have followed. 
Since that hearing on March 23, ac-
cording to the Gun Violence Archive, 
there have been at least 38 mass shoot-
ings in less than a month in America, 
where a ‘‘mass shooting’’ is defined as 
an incident where at least four people 
were shot. This past weekend—and I 
am sorry to say this is not an excep-
tion—25 people were shot in the city of 
Chicago alone. Every day, we lose 109 
American lives to gun violence. Hun-
dreds more are shot and wounded, car-
rying physical and emotional scars for 
a lifetime. These victims are our neigh-
bors, our friends, our families, and even 
a 1-year-old baby like Kayden Swann. 
I am glad President Biden is stepping 
up to this issue and taking action. Last 
week, the President stood in the White 
House Rose Garden and called gun vio-
lence exactly what it is. It is a public 
health crisis. He is right. We need to 
take a public health approach to re-
duce the violence that is killing so 
many of our fellow Americans. 
There is a playbook that works. We 
need to gather data and study the prob-
lem, identify causes and risk factors, 
and develop targeted prevention and 
intervention strategies that will help 
to bring the number of shootings down. 
We have stopped epidemics before—we 
are in the midst of one now—and we 
can do it again if we are willing to 
stand up and act. It works. 
President Biden took action last 
week and announced a set of common-
sense steps that are consistent with 
the Second Amendment and that actu-
ally will help reduce violence. He 
wants to reduce the proliferation of 
homemade ‘‘ghost guns,’’ which are 
untraceable and often undetectable; 
regulate the use of stabilizing braces 
that can effectively convert pistols 
into short-barreled rifles, like the 
weapon that was used by the gunman 
in Boulder; put forth a model State ex-
treme risk protection order law that 
would help States that want to use 
these interventions; restart an annual 
firearms trafficking report that tracks 
patterns of illicit gun trafficking; 
nominate a gun safety expert David 
Chipman to give the ATF its first con-
firmed leader since 2015. I am going to 
pay special attention to this nominee 
because it will come through the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee. 
How many times have you heard it 
said that we don’t need new laws; we 
just need to enforce the laws that are 
on the books? One of the Agencies that 
enforces these laws is the Bureau of Al-
cohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explo-
sives, or ATF. What the gun lobby has 
done over the years is to make sure the 
ATF hasn’t had the money or hasn’t 
had any leaders. We haven’t had any-
one in the post for 6 years at the ATF 
with Senate confirmation. I want to 
change that if we can. 
Last, but certainly not least, the 
President announced billions of dollars 
for evidence-based community violence 
intervention 
programs 
through 
the 
American Jobs Plan and other grant 
program efforts. These are smart, tar-
geted, and important proposals that 
are well within the bounds of the Con-
stitution and the President’s author-
ity. I commend him for that action. 
Yet we shouldn’t leave it to the 
President alone. We have a responsi-
bility, too. We have to make sure we 
close the loopholes in the gun back-
ground check system that make it too 
easy for criminals and those with men-
tal instability to get guns. We have 
known it for years, but we haven’t

closed these gaps. The House has 
passed universal background check leg-
islation. Now the ball is in the Senate’s 
court. We need at least 10 Republicans 
if all Democrats will support it. I hope 
my Republican colleagues are willing 
to stand and vote to close these gaps. 
There 
are 
other 
commonsense 
changes we can make that deal with 
gun violence and community preven-
tion. At a hearing I held on March 23, 
Dr. Selwyn Rogers of University of Chi-
cago Medicine pointed out that the 
NIH has nearly $43 billion for medical 
research, yet only $12.5 million dedi-
cated to funding for research into re-
ducing gun violence. We need to invest 
more into this research and into the 
CDC research, too. We also need to sup-
port evidence-based community pro-
grams that show they are effective in 
reducing violence. 
Saving lives from the horrors of gun 
violence should not be a partisan issue. 
It is absolutely heartbreaking to think 
about little Kayden Swann’s sitting in 
the backseat of a car on Lake Shore 
Drive—which I look out from my place 
in Chicago and see every day—and real-
ize that he was shot in the head at the 
age of 1 and is now fighting to survive. 
The question is, What are we going to 
do with this challenge of 40,000 gun vio-
lence deaths every year and more than 
100 every day—give up or stand up? 
I will tell you that I am not going to 
give up. I am going to do all I can to 
push commonsense, constitutional re-
forms to bring gun violence to an end 
in America. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
HONORING OFFICER WILLIAM F. EVANS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on Good 
Friday, another Capitol Police officer 
lost his life defending this building and 
all those in it. 
Officer Billy Evans was killed when 
an individual rammed Officer Evans 
with his car at the barricade Officer 
Evans was manning. Another Capitol 
Police officer, Officer Ken Shaver, was 
injured in the attack. 
We talk about how police officers 
leave their homes each day not know-
ing what they will face. Good Friday’s 
attack was a reminder of how true that 
is. 
We can only be thankful that despite 
the ever-present risk that they will not 
make it back to their homes, men and 
women like Officer Evans and Officer 
Shaver still choose to serve—to put 
themselves on the frontlines facing evil 
and danger so that the rest of us don’t 
have to. 
I know the officers of the Capitol Po-
lice have had an unthinkably difficult 
few months. I hope they know how 
grateful we are for their service. 
Today Officer Billy Evans lies in 
honor in the Rotunda, a fitting tribute 
to a man who lived and died to protect 
those who serve in this building. 
My thoughts and prayers are with Of-
ficer Evans’ two children, Logan and 
Abigail, with his mother Janice, and 
with all those who mourn this brave 
man. May his memory be eternal. 
SUPREME COURT 
Mr. President, on Friday, in what is 
fast becoming a theme of his Presi-
dency, President Biden caved to the de-
mands of the far left and officially es-
tablished his Court-packing Commis-
sion. 
Yes, Court packing, an idea that had 
been consigned to the ash heap of his-
tory almost a century ago, has been 
given new life by the far left who—wait 
for it—are upset that a duly elected 
Republican President was able to get 
his Justices confirmed to the Supreme 
Court. 
That is right, Mr. President. The ter-
rible crisis we are facing is that a Re-
publican President was able to fill 
three vacancies on the Supreme Court. 
I confess I had missed the part in the 
Constitution that said the Supreme 
Court is only legitimate if a majority 
of its members were nominated by a 
Democratic President or at least reli-
ably delivers liberals’ preferred out-
comes. 
But liberals didn’t, and now they are 
eager to ‘‘restore balance’’ to the Su-
preme Court by expanding the number 
of Supreme Court Justices and ensur-
ing that a Democratic President fills 
the new spots. 
President Biden—the same man who 
once called President Roosevelt’s failed 
Court-packing proposal a ‘‘bonehead 
idea’’ and a ‘‘terrible, terrible mistake 
to make’’—is apparently falling in with 
the far left’s demands. 
His Commission, composed largely of 
left-leaning 
scholars, 
Democratic 
operatives, and a few conservatives as 
bipartisan window dressing, will con-
sider Court packing and other struc-
tural ‘‘reforms’’ like term limits for 
Supreme Court Justices. 
It is funny how Democrats weren’t 
too concerned about term limits when 
revered liberal Justices were serving 
for decades. But faced with the terrible 
prospect that a Justice Barrett or a 
Justice Gorsuch might have a similarly 
long career, the left is suddenly eager 
to limit Supreme Court terms. 
There are so many things wrong with 
the left’s Court-packing proposals that 
it is difficult to know where to begin, 
but let’s start with the ludicrous idea 
that packing the Court will somehow 
restore the Court’s legitimacy in the 
eyes of the public—not that the Court’s 
legitimacy has been lost in the eyes of 
anyone but far-left liberals. 
In fact, the Supreme Court might be 
the Federal institution that garners 
the greatest degree of respect from the 
public. The Supreme Court’s approval 
rating routinely exceeds that of Con-
gress and usually by a substantial mar-
gin. 
But let’s suppose for a second that 
liberals are correct and that the Su-
preme Court has lost its legitimacy in 
the eyes of the public. 
If that is the case, there is nothing, 
nothing Democrats could do that would 
be more guaranteed to further under-
mine public trust in the Court than to 
pack the Court—nothing. 
Do Democrats seriously think that 
they can enhance the credibility of the 
Supreme Court in the eyes of the 
American people by expanding it to add 
more Democratic Justices? Do they 
think the 74 million people who voted 
for Republicans in the last election are 
going to see this as adding necessary 
balance to the Court? If they do, they 
should think again. 
As Justice Stephen Breyer noted just 
last week, ‘‘It is wrong to think of the 
court as another political institution. 
And it is doubly wrong to think of its 
members as junior-league politicians. 
Structural alteration motivated by the 
perception of political influence can 
only feed that perception, further erod-
ing that trust.’’ 
That from Justice Stephen Breyer. 
Republicans and, I venture to say, a 
lot of Independent and Democrat vot-
ers as well will see this for exactly 
what it is, and that is an attempt by 
Democrats to undermine an essential 
institution to ensure that Democrats 
get the Supreme Court rulings that 
they want. 
Democrats can dress up their open-
ness to Court-packing proposals in 
lofty language and faux expressions of 
concern for the institution, but no 
one—no one is fooled. This is about 
power, pure and simple. Democrats 
want power. 
They want to be able to impose the 
policies they want when they want 
them, and they are afraid, if the Su-
preme Court isn’t packed full of Demo-
crat nominees, the Supreme Court 
might rule against them. 
And so more and more Democrats are 
apparently perfectly willing to con-
sider undermining, if not destroying, a 
fundamental part of our system of gov-
ernment to guarantee—to guarantee 
their political power. 
Let’s think about this in practical 
terms for a minute. Let’s suppose that 
Democrats actually succeed in expand-
ing the Supreme Court and adding 
more Democratic nominees. What do 
they think is going to happen next 
time there is a Republican President 
and a Republican Congress? 
Well, I can tell you. Republicans 
would make their own move to ‘‘re-
store balance’’ and add some more Re-
publican Supreme Court nominees. And 
then I imagine when Democrats retook 
power, they would do the same thing. 
In a decade or so, the Supreme Court 
could be expanded to laughable propor-
tions. Think about it. How many Jus-
tices are we going to have? Fifteen? 
Twenty? Thirty? There would be no end 
to this lunacy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1886 
April 13, 2021 
In the words of Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg only 2 years ago, ‘‘Nine seems 
to be a good number. It’s been that way 
for a long time. . . . I think it was a 
bad idea when President Franklin Roo-
sevelt tried to pack the court.’’ 
And that, again, was the late Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She said it was a 
bad idea. 
And fortunately for the country, 
when President Roosevelt proposed his 
Court-packing plan, both Republicans 
and Democrats opposed it. 
Unfortunately, 
Democrats 
today 
seem to be more concerned with power 
than principle or, in some cases, maybe 
lack the courage to stand up to the fe-
rocity of the far left. 
In the past, President Biden has pow-
erfully defended American institutions, 
but now he seems incapable of standing 
up to the far left, and so now we have 
an American President implicitly en-
dorsing the idea of Court packing by 
establishing a Commission to study the 
proposal. 
Democrats like to talk about democ-
racy and making sure that people have 
a voice, but it is becoming increasingly 
clear that they think their voices and 
the voices of liberal Americans are the 
only voices that should be heard. 
Now, if they can’t win by convincing 
the public to elect strong Democratic 
majorities, they have made it increas-
ingly clear that they are willing to un-
dermine our institutions to ensure 
their grip on power. 
Don’t like the makeup of the Su-
preme Court? Expand the Court with 
new Democratic Justices until you can 
be sure you get the results you want. 
Don’t like Senate rules like the legis-
lative filibuster that give the minority 
party a voice in legislation? Change 
the rules. 
Don’t like your election prospects? 
Pass legislation like H.R. 1 or S. 1, de-
signed to give your party a permanent 
advantage in electoral contests. 
I understand Democrats’ passion for 
their political beliefs. I am pretty pas-
sionate about advancing my political 
principles, but I believe we should be 
advancing our principles the demo-
cratic way, by persuading people to 
vote for us, not by undermining our 
democratic institutions to give our 
party an advantage. 
I am deeply disappointed that Presi-
dent Biden found himself unable to 
stand up to pressure from the radical 
left, but I hope—I hope that at least 
some Democrats will find the courage 
to oppose these dangerous attempts to 
undermine our system of government. 
The Biden Court-packing Commis-
sion is a solution in search of a prob-
lem and an attempt at a raw power 
grab by Democrats. It should quickly 
fade into the obscurity that it de-
serves. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
NOMINATION OF GARY GENSLER 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon to discuss the nomina-
tion of Mr. Gary Gensler to serve as 
the Chairman of the Securities and Ex-
change Commission. 
To start this, I just want to remind 
my colleagues, the mission of the SEC 
is really threefold: It is to protect in-
vestors; it is to facilitate capital for-
mation; and it is to maintain fair, or-
derly, and efficient financial markets, 
capital markets. 
And the fact is, America’s capital 
markets are, without a doubt, the envy 
of the world. There are no other capital 
markets anywhere on the planet that 
have the depth, the liquidity, the diver-
sity, the flexibility that allow growing 
businesses to grow as readily as our 
capital markets allow. 
And that is a big part of why we are 
outperforming the world in terms of a 
recovery 
from 
the 
pandemic— 
coronavirus infections and lockdowns 
and all the rest. It is one of many rea-
sons, but it is an important one. 
It is also worth remembering that 
that recovery can be stymied if regu-
lators impose inappropriate, burden-
some regulations, including, say, back-
door regulation by enforcements that 
we have seen in the past that hamper 
job growth, that limit access to capital 
or if these regulators mandate man-
agers of publically traded companies to 
favor so-called stakeholders over the 
interests of the people who actually 
own the company, which is to say the 
shareholders. 
The SEC has historically adminis-
tered Federal security laws and pur-
sued its mission on a pretty bipartisan 
basis, but increasingly, there are some 
who want the SEC to stray from this 
tradition and instead to push the 
bounds of its legal and regulatory au-
thorities in order to advance a par-
ticular liberal, social, and cultural 
agenda. 
Unfortunately, when he was the 
Chairman of the CFTC, Mr. Gensler 
demonstrated a willingness to push the 
legal authorities and the legal limits of 
that Agency’s authority. He was re-
sponsible for a CFTC rule on position 
limits that was overturned in court 
and another rule on cross-border swaps 
that was viewed by many, including 
international regulators, as exceeding 
the CFTC’s authority. This raises ques-
tions about whether he would be will-
ing to exceed the legal bounds on the 
SEC’s authority as well. 
Let 
me 
acknowledge 
that 
Mr. 
Gensler, without a doubt, has a great 
deal of knowledge and experience in 
our securities markets. There is no 
question about it. He has a lot of exper-
tise there. But based on his record as a 
regulator in the past and statements 
that he has made during the course of 
this nomination process, I am con-
cerned that he will use the SEC and its 
regulatory powers to advance an agen-
da that should not be the purview of 
the SEC—specifically, global warming 
and climate change, political spending 
disclosures, and issues of racial in-
equality and diversity. 
Securities laws and securities regula-
tions are not the appropriate vehicle to 
address any of these topics. That is the 
reason why we have environmental and 
political spending and civil rights laws, 
and we have Federal Agencies that are 
responsible for enforcing those laws. If 
anybody thinks those laws are not ade-
quate, OK, then take it up before Con-
gress and have Congress change the 
laws. We are the people who should be 
responsible because we are the ones 
who are accountable to the American 
people. It is certainly not the role of 
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion—an independent financial regu-
lator with no political accountability 
to voters whatsoever—to address dif-
ficult, challenging, sometimes conten-
tious political, social, and cultural 
issues. 
I have to say, nothing that Mr. 
Gensler said at his hearing or since has 
alleviated my concerns. Mr. Gensler 
did state that his regulatory approach 
would be grounded in the Supreme 
Court’s definition of ‘‘materiality,’’ but 
he declined to explain what that really 
means, what that means to him, what 
are the limiting principles. 
For example, I asked him if it would 
be OK for companies to be forced or 
pressured to comply with quotas with 
respect to the race, the gender, or sex-
ual orientation of their board mem-
bers. In response, Mr. Gensler did not 
disavow the idea of forcing or pres-
suring companies to use these kinds of 
quotas to achieve board diversity. 
I also asked him if a company’s fi-
nancially insignificant spending on, 
say, energy or maybe political advo-
cacy—if that can ever be material in-
formation that must be disclosed to in-
vestors. Again, I was talking about fi-
nancially insignificant transactions. In 
response, Mr. Gensler essentially indi-
cated that if a number of politically 
motivated activist investors wanted to 
know the information—for example, in-
formation related to global warming or 
political spending—then that makes it 
material information even if it is fi-
nancially insignificant to the com-
pany, and therefore the SEC could pre-
sumably mandate its disclosure. I 
think that is completely inconsistent 
with the whole idea of materiality. 
What it seems to me the bottom line 
for Mr. Gensler is, as long there are lib-
eral activist investors who demand to 
know certain things about environ-
mental, social, or corporate govern-
ance issues, then it would be OK to 
force disclosure of those issues, and I 
was not able to discern a situation in 
which Mr. Gensler would not be willing 
to mandate disclosure of that kind of 
information. 
There is another issue that is con-
cerning 
to 
me, 
and 
that 
is 
Mr. 
Gensler’s answers to questions during 
his nomination hearing about recent 
stock market volatility. 
We have seen some extraordinary 
volatility in a handful of companies for 
a variety of relatively novel reasons. 
Some have suggested that we have to 
take a paternalistic approach to grown 
adults and maybe limit their ability to

make investments because they don’t 
know well enough what is good for 
them. And maybe there are apps that 
make it too user friendly to buy 
stocks, so maybe that leads to impru-
dent decisions. 
I find it shocking that we would ac-
tually 
contemplate 
limiting 
grown 
adults’ ability to make their own deci-
sions. I wasn’t sure where Mr. Gensler 
came out on this, and in some respects, 
I think, he indicated that there may be 
some sympathy to this paternalistic 
view that I think would be a very, very 
big mistake. 
So the nomination process just never 
alleviated the concerns I have. Maybe 
my concerns will prove to have been 
misplaced. I certainly hope so. Mr. 
Gensler is a very intelligent, knowl-
edgeable, thoughtful person. He is very 
likeable. I happen to like him person-
ally. But because of these concerns I 
have, I will not be able to support his 
nomination, and I will be voting no 
later today. 
Mr. TOOMEY. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate Senator TOOMEY’s comments and 
the spirit in which they were delivered. 
I rise to urge my colleagues to sup-
port President Biden’s nominee to be 
Chairman of the Securities and Ex-
change Commission, Gary Gensler. 
In March, Mr. Gensler appeared be-
fore the Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs Committee for his nomination 
hearing. The committee advanced him 
to the full Senate with a bipartisan 
vote. 
Mr. Gensler is an experienced public 
servant with a strong record of holding 
Wall Street accountable. He will lead 
the SEC at a time when it has become 
more and more obvious to more and 
more people that the stock market is 
detached from the reality of working 
families’ lives. Mr. Gensler will bring 
the SEC’s focus back to the people who 
make this country work. He will push 
to ensure that markets are a way for 
families to save and invest for their 
children’s education, for a downpay-
ment on a home, for a secure retire-
ment, not a game for hedge fund man-
agers, where workers lose every single 
time. 
Mr. Gensler, as Chair of the Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission, 
led the implementation of the Dodd- 
Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act to bring trans-
parency and stability to more markets. 
He was tough on enforcement issues. 
He cracked down on big banks that had 
manipulated interest rates for years. 
Mr. Gensler is an expert on finance 
and markets. He previously served as 
Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic 
Finance and Assistant Secretary of the 
Treasury for Financial Markets. 
He will carry out the SEC’s mission— 
the reason it was created—to ensure 
that 
U.S. 
capital 
markets 
deliver 
growth and investment opportunities 
that grow the real economy and give 
middle-class families the opportunity 
to build wealth. He understands we 
need to ensure confidence and stability 
in our markets as the foundation to 
grow American businesses and support 
the workers who make their companies 
successful. Mr. Gensler will listen to 
families saving for the future as well as 
professionals who manage workers’ 
pensions and retirements. He will make 
sure that savers, large and small, can 
hold corporate executives accountable. 
When it comes to enforcement, Mr. 
Gensler has shown the guts to take on 
bad actors, no matter how big and no 
matter how powerful they are, and he 
will hold them accountable. 
The pandemic has reminded people 
just how rigged the Wall Street system 
can be. 
About 2 months ago, I became chair 
of the committee that is called the 
Senate Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs. To most in this 
body, the committee is just referred to 
as the Banking Committee or Senate 
Banking. This is a committee where 
Wall Street—it has been all about Wall 
Street, little about housing, and damn 
near 
nothing 
about 
urban 
affairs. 
Those days are behind us. This com-
mittee will look out for small inves-
tors. That is why the SEC is so impor-
tant, and Mr. Gensler’s work. It will 
help to expand housing, it will make a 
difference in communities, and it will 
no longer be the province of Wall 
Street. 
If you look only at the stock market, 
it looks like the pandemic never hap-
pened. The market reached new highs 
last fall. Families and businesses con-
tinued to suffer. Workers put their 
health and their lives on the line to 
keep businesses running, and once 
again, hedge funds and insiders reaped 
the vast majority of the profits. 
We know that over the last decade or 
so—more than a decade—we have seen 
profits go up, we have seen executive 
compensation explode upward, and we 
have seen workers more and more pro-
ductive. Yet wages have been flat. 
That is our challenge. We saw during 
the pandemic that was even worse. It 
doesn’t have to be that way. We can 
have a market that works for every-
one. Mr. Gensler shares that goal. 
Under his leadership, the SEC can pro-
tect people’s hard-earned savings, can 
keep our markets stable, and can make 
them fair. This will let us create an 
economy where everyone can partici-
pate. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues 
to vote yes on Mr. Gensler’s nomina-
tion. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER ANDREW L. PATE 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon to say thank you and 
farewell to a member of the Commerce 
Committee staff who is leaving the 
Senate soon. Commander Andrew L. 
Pate—Andy, as we know him—is com-
pleting his 2-year assignment as senior 
policy adviser and Coast Guard con-
gressional fellow on the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation. 
For those who are not aware, the 
Coast Guard’s congressional fellows 
program is a highly competitive pro-
gram that assigns Coast Guard officers 
to congressional offices and commit-
tees as detailees. This elite program 
brings the Coast Guard’s ‘‘cream of the 
crop’’ to Washington. These officers up-
hold the Coast Guard’s core values of 
honor, respect, and devotion to duty. 
These special assignments serve to edu-
cate Coast Guard officers on the inner 
workings of Congress. The Coast Guard 
benefits from this program by bringing 
its unique perspective to the process of 
drafting and passing legislation, as 
well as gaining leaders within its own 
ranks who deeply understand the legis-
lative process. And, of course, the Con-
gress gains immensely from the obvi-
ous leadership and intelligence and 
work ethic of these great men and 
women. 
Andy Pate was an obvious choice for 
this fellowship—not once but twice. In 
July of 2008, not long after I arrived in 
the 
Senate, 
then-Lieutenant 
Pate 
joined my office to serve as my first 
Coast Guard fellow, where he set a high 
bar for those who would come after 
him. 
Following his departure, Andy com-
pleted tours as a commanding officer of 
Coast Guard cutters around the world. 
His operational assignments have fo-
cused on search and rescue, counter-
narcotics, migrant interdiction, home-
land security, defense operations, and 
living marine resource protection pro-
grams spanning the North Atlantic, 
the Equator, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Vir-
gin Islands, and the Arabian Gulf. 
Andy also served as strategic analyst 
in the Commandant’s Advisory Group 
at Coast Guard headquarters and as a 
transition team member for the 25th 
Commandant of the Coast Guard. He 
went on to become the Coast Guard’s 
international security fellow at the 
Center for Strategic and International 
Studies. 
Since rejoining my team in 2019, 
Andy has had a significant impact on 
the Commerce Committee. His exper-
tise as a cutterman and senior officer 
has meaningfully informed the com-
mittee’s efforts, culminating in the en-
actment of the Elijah E. Cummings 
Coast Guard Authorization Act—the 
service’s 2-year comprehensive reau-
thorization. 
Additionally, 
Commander 
Pate 
championed a key Coast Guard provi-
sion in the Johnny Isakson and David 
P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and 
Benefits Improvement Act. In response 
to the COVID–19 pandemic, Congress 
extended lease protections for service-
members

leases impacted by ‘‘stop movement’’ 
orders. However, the original bill unin-
tentionally omitted the Coast Guard. 
The small but important change Andy 
initiated has had a positive impact on 
thousands of his fellow Coast Guard 
members and their families. 
This is an exciting moment for Andy. 
Soon, he will assume command of the 
Coast Guard Cutter Mohawk in Key 
West, FL. I know the Mohawk and the 
Coast Guard will benefit from Andy’s 
steadfast spirit and determination. 
I salute Andy’s service and leadership 
in our Nation’s armed services, and I 
thank him for all of his hard work. I 
have been blessed with many fellows. I 
rise to speak for fellows really only 
when they come for two tours in my of-
fice. 
Andy’s presence on the Commerce 
Committee will be missed, but his col-
leagues and his country are grateful for 
his dedication and diligence. I know 
Kristen, Aidan, Karissa, and Alexander 
are proud of him also. 
On behalf of the American people, I 
extend my deepest gratitude and wish 
Andy Pate the best of luck in his fu-
ture endeavors. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in all 
honesty, sometimes it is hard to figure 
out exactly what the policy goals are 
that the Biden administration is striv-
ing to achieve. 
Take the so-called COVID–19 relief 
bill that was signed into law just last 
month. Despite the fact that every 
pandemic relief bill that became law 
last year received broad bipartisan sup-
port, this bill did not. In fact, not a 
single Republican voted for it. 
The Biden administration is pre-
paring to rinse and repeat this strategy 
with a new misleading label, calling it 
infrastructure. But the reason why Re-
publicans didn’t vote for the COVID–19 
relief bill, while we did for every single 
one last year, was because only about 
10 percent of the bill was actually dedi-
cated to the goal stated by the pro-
ponents. Only about 10 percent of the 
massive $1.9 trillion bill was related to 
the pandemic, and less than 1 percent 
was related to our vaccination efforts. 
As I said, now the administration is 
preparing a rinse-and-repeat strategy 
with a new misleading label: ‘‘infra-
structure.’’ 
If one of the surveyed questions on 
‘‘Family Feud’’ was, ‘‘Name something 
that is considered infrastructure,’’ I 
would bet the top two answers would be 
roads and bridges. The other popular 
answers would probably include: air-
ports, railroads, ports, tunnels, and wa-
terways. 
But 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues are broadening that definition 
in ways that really are not accurate. 
Just as they tried to brand things 
like environmental justice funding as 
‘‘pandemic relief,’’ they are now get-
ting very creative with the definition 
of ‘‘infrastructure.’’ In fact, the Presi-
dent’s infrastructure plan has a lot in 
common with his COVID–19 relief plan. 
First of all is the pricetag. The non-
partisan Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget estimates this plan 
would cost $2.65 trillion. That is tril-
lion with a ‘‘t.’’ 
For reference, the last major infra-
structure bill that became law in 2015 
was widely described as the largest 
package in more than a decade. That 
overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation 
totaled just over $300 billion, one-ninth 
of the cost of this new plan. 
But there is another similarity be-
tween these two massive proposals, the 
long list of unrelated progressive or 
liberal policy priorities. Only about 5 
percent of the spending in this colossal 
infrastructure plan is directed toward 
roads and bridges. 
So where does the rest of the money 
go? For starters, this proposal would 
provide $174 billion for electric vehicle 
chargers, far more money than would 
go toward the roads and bridges Ameri-
cans drive on every day. There are 
roughly 280 million cars on the road, 
the vast majority of which are internal 
combustion engine driven. Yet rather 
than provide for the vast majority of 
travelers, this would favor $174 billion 
for electric vehicle chargers. 
This proposal includes a whopping 
$400 billion to support caregiving for el-
derly and disabled Americans. There is 
no question about the importance of 
quality care for these individuals, but 
this is no definition of infrastructure. 
So this is really another Trojan horse: 
calling it one thing, making it look 
like one thing, and doing something 
entirely unrelated and different. 
There is $25 billion for government 
childcare programs; $10 billion to cre-
ate a Civilian Climate Corp—whatever 
that is. Then there is the massive fund-
ing for sustainable buildings and pri-
vate homes. 
This proposal would provide $213 bil-
lion to build or retrofit more than 2 
million 
affordable 
and 
sustainable 
places to live. This is really just the 
Green New Deal 2.0. And right on cue 
come the unrealistic targets to lower 
emissions. 
Rather than research and develop-
ment or innovation, this relies on tax-
ation and regulation, an unrealistic 
goal. This infrastructure plan calls for 
100 percent of electricity to come from 
renewable sources by 2035. 
To be clear, we are nowhere close to 
that target now. And the effort to get 
there would have a devastating impact 
on States all across the country, in-
cluding mine. 
Last year, renewables accounted for 
only 20 percent of our total electricity 
generation. In Texas, we generate more 
electricity from wind turbines than 
any other source in the country, but 
yet last year alone, renewables of all 
kinds—solar, wind, biomass, you name 
it—accounted for less than 20 percent. 
Natural gas accounts for more than 
double that. 
We experienced what happens when 
these unrealistic, pie-in-the-sky goals 
are set. We had a 120-year weather 
event, the so-called polar vortex in 
Texas. It is a long, sustained period of 
subzero freezing that may be more 
common in Massachusetts than it is in 
Texas. As a matter of fact, like I said, 
it is a 120-year weather event. What we 
found out was the severe weather af-
fected wind turbines, which effectively 
froze up snow- and ice-covered solar 
panels, and even natural gas went off-
line because the electric pumps that 
compress the natural gas to put it into 
the pipelines failed as well. About the 
only reliable fuel source during that 
period of time was nuclear power, 
which represents a fraction of our total 
energy needs. 
I am a proud supporter of renewable 
energy sources as well as a broader ef-
fort to reduce emissions. There is no 
question about this. Just last week, I 
joined folks from the North American 
Development Bank and their public 
and private partners to announce a new 
solar farm in Webb County, Laredo, 
TX. But there is a big difference be-
tween supporting renewables and what 
the Biden administration is trying to 
do with this unrealistic and pie-in-the- 
sky target. 
At the start of the pandemic, we got 
a small taste of the real-world impact 
of a shift from oil and gas and what 
that would look like. When the pan-
demic hit, the need for Texas’s greatest 
natural resource plummeted. Demand 
dropped precipitously as people stayed 
home and quit driving. With fewer cars 
and planes on the road and in the sky, 
oil and gas producers were left with a 
high supply and low demand. And that 
is when the layoffs began. 
Last fall, a report by Deloitte found 
that between March and August of 2020, 
about 107,000 oil and gas workers were 
laid off. To be clear, this doesn’t in-
clude the countless workers who had 
their pay cut or were temporarily fur-
loughed. 
If the Biden administration enacts 
aggressive deadlines to eradicate our 
most prevalent and abundant energy 
sources, and the jobs they create, a lot 
of Texas energy workers and their fam-
ilies would be left high and dry. 
But the bad news doesn’t stop there. 
The list of unrelated and downright 
damaging provisions in this bill is a 
long one. The big question with any 
legislation, especially something of 
this size, is, How are you going to pay 
for it? 
In the past, the vast majority of in-
frastructure funding has come from the 
highway trust fund, but for years it has 
faced serious shortfalls. To a serious 
degree, Texans have footed the bill for 
those shortfalls. In fact, we are one of 
the few States that receives less than

it contributes to the highway trust 
fund, a so-called donor State. 
But rather than address the solvency 
of the trust fund and the inequitable 
burden put on donor States before the 
authorization expires at the end of Sep-
tember, the administration has com-
pletely ignored the issue altogether. 
The President’s infrastructure plan 
doesn’t even draw on the highway trust 
fund. So in order to pay for the sweep-
ing liberal wish list, President Biden 
has proposed the largest set of tax 
hikes in more than half a century. By 
increasing the business tax rate from 
21 to 28 percent, we would see an in-
crease in revenue in the short term but 
serious long-term economic harm. 
The tax burden on American compa-
nies would be greater than that of our 
biggest trading partner, as well as our 
competitors, and would have far-reach-
ing consequences on our competitive-
ness and our economy and jobs for 
hard-working American families. 
After all, we know the cost of these 
tax hikes won’t be reflected in lower 
earnings for CEOs. The brunt would be 
borne by consumers who pay higher 
prices, workers who earn lower wages, 
and, let’s not forget, those whose jobs 
would disappear entirely. 
A study by the National Association 
of Manufacturers found this proposal 
would put 1 million people out of work 
in the United States in the next 2 
years—a million people out of work. 
Just as we are beginning to come out 
of the pandemic, having been vac-
cinated and taking care for both our 
health and the health of others and 
now opening up our economy, this 
would be the reward for the American 
people: 1 million Americans out of 
work as a result of this misguided pol-
icy. 
This legislation is not about improv-
ing America’s roads and bridges; it is 
another partisan wish list under the 
guise of something that has tradition-
ally enjoyed bipartisan support. De-
spite what some people think, the 
American people, I believe, are smart 
enough to see through this bill for 
what it is, an unaffordable, unwanted 
liberal wish list. 
The Federal deficit is at its highest 
since World War II. This is not a time 
to go on another spending spree, using 
borrowed money from future genera-
tions. This is the time to craft smart 
policies that achieve the needs of our 
country without driving the next gen-
eration deeper and deeper into debt. 
There is no question that America’s 
roads and bridges—our real infrastruc-
ture—need an investment from the 
Federal Government, but we can up-
date that infrastructure for far less 
than $2.65 trillion. 
Last Congress, the Environment and 
Public Works Committee developed a 
truly bipartisan example of an infra-
structure bill. It included provisions 
for rebuilding our crumbling roads and 
bridges to improve road safety, protect 
the environment, and grow the econ-
omy. 
The bill was so popular, in fact, that 
it passed the committee unanimously. 
And what was the pricetag on that bill? 
Just over 10 percent of the cost of the 
President’s current proposal. It would 
have authorized $287 billion over 5 
years. That is $100 billion less than 
what Democrats proposed spending on 
caregiving alone. 
A bipartisan bill to rebuild our crum-
bling roads and bridges is possible. We 
have done it before, and we can do it 
again. But our Democratic colleagues 
are going to have trouble getting not 
only Republicans but many Members of 
their own party on board if they con-
tinue to push this sort of unrealistic, 
economy-harming sort of plan. 
I am sure it comes as no surprise 
that putting Americans out of work 
while driving up the deficit and hurting 
our global competitiveness are wildly 
unpopular. Even smoke and mirrors 
can’t conceal the impact of this so- 
called infrastructure bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
HONORING STATE PATROL SERGEANT JIM SMITH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a 
short tribute and then maybe about an 
8- or 9-minute speech that I have. 
Today, I want to pay tribute to Iowa 
State Patrol Sergeant Jim Smith, who 
courageously gave his life in the line of 
duty this past Friday. 
Sergeant Smith, a 27-year Iowa State 
Patrol veteran and a tactical team 
leader, put himself in harm’s way on 
behalf of his fellow Iowans last week, 
and it cost him everything. 
Sergeant Smith is being remembered 
as a dedicated father, a loyal public 
servant, a man of God who left a posi-
tive impression on everybody he en-
countered. 
I mourn for his family, fellow troop-
ers, friends, and the entire Independ-
ence, IA, community at this tragic 
loss. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. President, I pose the following 
question to my fellow Senators, some-
thing I doubt there is much disagree-
ment on, but time is moving on. We 
need to take some action shortly. So 
this question, if a deadly poison were 
killing thousands of Americans each 
year, what would you do? Would you 
work to find the solution to prevent 
these deaths, or would you choose to be 
complacent, reactive, and allow fellow 
citizens to die? If all levels of law en-
forcement were pleading for action to 
prevent future fatalities, would you 
heed their warning—the last question— 
or would you roll the dice with the 
lives that are on the line? 
I know I would seek to be very 
proactive. I am here today to call at-
tention to the dire need for Congress to 
schedule fentanyl-related substances 
before it is too late. 
Without hyperbole or theatrics, such 
action could save the lives of thou-
sands of Americans. Fentanyl is a syn-
thetic opioid that is about 30 times 
more potent than heroin. 
While dangerous and deadly, fentanyl 
also has some medically recognized 
qualities, often for pain management. 
However, fentanyl abuse has become 
more common and more dangerous in 
recent years because of the increase in 
fentanyl analogs. These analogs are 
chemically similar to fentanyl, but 
many are much more powerful and, of 
course, deadly. 
Much of the illicitly manufactured 
fentanyl that is responsible for Amer-
ican overdoses and the deaths con-
nected with them has originated in 
China. 
Unfortunately, 
these 
deadly 
drugs are not permanently controlled 
in the United States. As such, fentanyl 
analogs aren’t on the same footing as 
other dangerous drugs like heroin, 
LSD, ecstasy, or cocaine. The sad part 
is, the drug dealers know all of this. 
They can skirt the law by easily ma-
nipulating the structure of fentanyl so 
that it isn’t technically covered by ex-
isting law. But that doesn’t make it 
any less potent and dangerous. We all 
know the results are lethal. How le-
thal? Well, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention states that more 
than 36,000 people died from overdoses 
involving 
synthetic 
opioids 
like 
fentanyl in 2019. Nearly 50,000 overdose 
deaths are projected for 2020. 
As is, the law can’t keep up with the 
rapidly evolving drug trends when the 
chemists work on these drugs and 
change them just a little bit to get 
around the law. The Attorney General 
can outlaw new variations of a drug on 
an ad hoc basis, but do you know what? 
This process can take years. By the 
time an analog is added to the sched-
ule, do you know what? The drug traf-
fickers are already out with one or 
more other variations that don’t vio-
late that law. Simply put, the law 
can’t keep up with the rapid pace of il-
licit drug producers and traffickers. 
This is particularly problematic for 
fentanyl analog enforcement. 
How can we address this seemingly 
endless cycle? How can we ensure that 
those suffering from substance use dis-
orders aren’t killed at the hands of 
greedy drug dealers? The answer is to 
stop fentanyl analogs from being avail-
able in the very first place. We must 
keep it out of our country and, hence, 
then being peddled by criminals. 
On February 6, 2018, the Drug En-
forcement Administration published a 
temporary order that scheduled and 
placed all fentanyl-related substances 
in schedule I. Congress subsequently 
extended this authority until May 6 of 
this year, which is just around the cor-
ner. So we have 23 days until this au-
thority expires. Congress must act to 
extend this scheduling order. If we do 
not, we will face a surge of rapidly 
emerging fentanyl drugs, wherein the 
chemists and the criminals will be 
ahead of anything that the Justice De-
partment does. 
The Justice Department then has 
made clear that this classwide sched-
uling order has made a big difference in 
Chinese fentanyl entering our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1890 
April 13, 2021 
China has agreed to match U.S. policy 
targeting synthetic fentanyl, but if we 
lose the authority to rapidly detect 
and outlaw fentanyl analogs, we lose 
any footing that we have with the Chi-
nese 
Government 
in 
preventing 
fentanyl from entering our country. 
This scheduling order saves lives be-
cause China reciprocates. China’s mo-
tive in scheduling fentanyl analogs 
isn’t necessarily altruistic; it is be-
cause the United States is doing it. So 
if we stop, China stops, and if that hap-
pens, fentanyl analogs will surely flood 
our communities. 
We can prevent this, so we must pre-
vent it. With the ongoing increase in 
overdose deaths, we must continue to 
support efforts to curb fentanyl abuse. 
This 
means 
we 
must 
extend 
the 
classwide scheduling order that other-
wise expires on May 6, 23 days away. 
Now this, I think—I am pretty sure— 
isn’t a political or a partisan issue. 
Senators from both sides of the aisle 
support efforts to schedule fentanyl 
substances. Members of the Biden ad-
ministration have also indicated that 
addressing fentanyl is urgent. In fact, 
during his confirmation hearing before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, At-
torney General Garland stated that the 
constantly evolving nature of fentanyl 
analogs is—and I want to quote the 
new Attorney General—‘‘a problem 
both for detection as well as . . . en-
forcement’’ and that he is ‘‘in favor of 
doing something either by scheduling 
or legislation’’ to proactively address 
the problem of fentanyl-related sub-
stances. Likewise, both law enforce-
ment and substance abuse prevention 
groups believe Congress must act in 
scheduling fentanyl. 
It is up to Congress to pass legisla-
tion to extend the fentanyl scheduling 
order. So I urge all of my colleagues to 
join me and a lot of other Republicans 
and Democrats in the fight against 
fentanyl. In the midst of an opioid epi-
demic, a polydrug crisis, and a COVID– 
19 pandemic, how can we allow for any 
additional death and destruction? The 
clock is ticking. We are closing in on 
the deadline of May 6.

TRIBUTE TO JUDGE TOD 
KAUFMAN 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor longtime Kanawha 
County Circuit Judge Tod Kaufman 
upon his retirement after more than 32 
remarkable years of service to the 13th 
Judicial Circuit. 
I have often said there is no greater 
accomplishment than to find yourself 
in a position to give back to the com-
munity you love. As a Charleston na-
tive, Judge Kaufman has served the 
people of Kanawha County with profes-
sionalism, fairmindedness, and great 
respect from the day he took office in 
1988. 
Following his undergraduate edu-
cation, he worked as a paralegal in the 
Washington, DC, law firm of Covington 
& Burling and received a law degree 
from West Virginia University College 
of Law in 1980. He served a clerkship on 
the U.S. Tax Court during law school 
before joining his late father’s Charles-
ton law firm of Kaufman & Ratliff in 
1980. Prior to his appointment as judge, 
he served as my colleague in the State 
legislature and was appointed to the 
State senate in 1982 by then-Governor 
Jay Rockefeller and was elected in 
1984. Judge Kaufman’s lectured inter-
nationally at prestigious law schools 
and conferences and is a former mem-
ber of the Mass Litigation Panel of the 
West Virginia Supreme Court and past 
president and executive officer of the 
West Virginia Judicial Association. 
Shortly after graduating law school, 
Judge Kaufman tragically lost his par-
ents, former Senator and World War II 
veteran Paul Kaufman and Rose, and 
brother, Steven, in a car accident. I 
know their unfailing love and influence 
had a tremendous impact on the person 
he was to become. Both of his parents 
were extremely active in their commu-
nity and passionate about many social 
issues. I will always be personally 
grateful to them that they passed their 
work ethic and compassion on to Judge 
Kaufman, because he has done so much 
good in our home State due to their in-
fluence. In 2011, the 35th Street Bridge 
over the Kanawha River between the 
East End and Kanawha City was re-
named in their honor, and I am certain 
they would be so very proud of Judge 
Kaufman’s legacy and personal values. 
Throughout the years, Judge Kauf-
man has witnessed the drastic changes 
in the judicial landscape. Technology 
in the courts has played a crucial role, 
especially with current events as they 
are, but Judge Kaufman has always 
promoted the value of interpersonal 
communication and protecting the hu-
manism in our court processes. He has 
been fiercely protective of the interests 
of the people in front of him in the 
courtroom, acknowledging the heavy 
responsibility of representing the jus-
tice system. He and I served in the 
State senate together, and in the many 
years I have called him a friend, Judge 
Kaufman has never taken his position 
lightly and has always seen himself 
primarily as a servant of the people of 
Kanawha County and of West Virginia. 
His view of the law is something I will 
always admire, and I know it has also 
inspired countless young judges and 
lawyers. 
I will always be grateful to Judge 
Kaufman for his years of friendship and 
our shared passion for serving the peo-
ple of West Virginia. While he is retir-
ing and everyone is sure to miss his 
strong leadership, Judge Kaufman’s un-
wavering dedication will leave a last-
ing legacy with the countless lives he 
has touched. Again, I congratulate him 
for his remarkable years of service, and 
I am honored to wish good health and 
much happiness to Judge Kaufman, his 
wife 
Barrie, 
and 
their 
daughters, 
Paula, Caroline, and Sophia, in the 
days and years ahead.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DR. DAVID C. 
WHERRY 
∑ Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I 
would like to take a moment to recog-
nize the remarkable life of Dr. David 
Wherry. 
Born in Pawnee City, NE, he was the 
son of the former Nebraska Senator 
Kenneth S. Wherry, who served as the 
minority leader here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
Dr. Wherry attended Doane College 
in Crete, NE, before enrolling at the 
U.S. Naval Academy. 
He then chose to go into the medical 
profession. 
Little did he know the major impact 
he would have in this field. 
After graduating from George Wash-
ington University with his medical de-
gree and completing his surgical train-
ing, he was commissioned as a Medical 
Corps officer in the U.S. Air Force. 
He then moved overseas for his resi-
dency, taking a position as a surgical 
doctor at the 7559th USAF Hospital in 
Burtonwood, United Kingdom. 
He spent more than 2 years there be-
fore returning to the United States to 
become a teacher at George Wash-
ington University and later also at 
Georgetown University. 
After years of teaching, Dr. Wherry 
returned to Active Duty during Oper-
ation Desert Storm and retired in 1993 
as a colonel. 
Following his years of service to our 
country, he returned to teaching and 
academic research. 
Dr. Wherry became renowned in the 
medical world as a leading innovator in 
minimally invasive surgery, such as 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the 
gallbladder. 
In his research in this area, he pub-
lished over 50 manuscripts, 3 book 
chapters, and produced 2 films. 
Additionally, 
he 
helped 
found 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy courses 
for servicemembers and trained thou-
sands of military surgeons. 
I want to note that Dr. Wherry was 
one of the first doctors in the United 
States to perform colonoscopies, mak-
ing him a leading expert in this proce-
dure that is performed on so many 
Americans and is vital in helping to de-
tect and catch diseases like colon can-
cer. 
International work was important to 
him, and he was successful in helping 
bring humanitarian aid to hospitals in 
the Philippines. 
He also collaborated with the Uni-
formed Services University of the 
Health Sciences, USUHS, and with the 
University 
of 
the 
Philippines/Phil-
ippine General Hospital in bringing 
surgical residents to do scientific re-
search at USUHS as well as arranged 
exchanges between medical students 
for training purposes. 
He wanted to share and expand on his 
work by collaborating with others, so 
he helped found the Society of Amer-
ican Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Sur-
geons. 
He was a member of the Socie´te´ 
Internationale de Chirurgie and Inter-
national Biliary Association. 
On top of all of these efforts, he con-
tinued to be a senior surgical consult-
ant to the medical division of the U.S. 
Department of State. 
His work and dedication to improv-
ing surgeries around the world and for 
our military men and women has been 
recognized by the State Department 
and the Department of Defense. 
Both agencies presented him with 
their Meritorious Honor Award. 
In addition to his place as a leader in 
the medical world, he was also a dedi-
cated husband and father.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1892 
April 13, 2021 
His wife, Azucena ‘‘Ceny’’ Wherry, 
was an RN whom he married in 1975. 
His son, Kenneth D. Wherry, followed 
in his father’s footsteps and joined the 
military to serve his country, retiring 
as a lieutenant colonel. 
Dr. David Wherry represents the best 
of Nebraska. 
He was a hard worker who was not 
afraid to put in long hours. 
Because of his dedication to studying 
and advancing medicine, he changed 
the world for the better. 
I join all Nebraskans in honoring Dr. 
Wherry’s life and recognizing his faith-
ful service to our Nation and his in-
credible contributions to medicine.∑

DAKOTA 
SENATE 
CON-
CURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4010 
∑ Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD, North Dakota Senate Con-
current Resolution No. 4010 as passed 
by the Sixty-seventh Legislative As-
sembly of North Dakota. 
The material follows: 
SIXTY-SEVENTH
LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY
OF 
NORTH DAKOTA IN REGULAR SESSION COM-
MENCING TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 2021 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4010 
(Senators Clemens, Myrdal) 
(Representative Rohr) 
A concurrent resolution clarifying the 1975 
ratification by the 44th Legislative Assem-
bly of the proposed 1972 Equal Rights 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States only was valid through 
March 22, 1979. 
Whereas, the 92nd Congress of the United 
States of America, during its second session, 
with the constitutionally required vote of 
two-thirds of both houses, on March 22, 1972, 
gave final approval to House Joint Resolu-
tion No. 208, commonly referred to as the 
Equal Rights Amendment, to propose the 
amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, pursuant to Article V of the 
Constitution of the United States; and 
Whereas, in offering the proposed federal 
constitutional 
amendment 
to 
America’s 
state lawmakers, the 92nd Congress chose a 
deadline of 7 years, or until March 22, 1979, 
for the constitutionally mandated ratifica-
tion of the amendment by three-fourths of 
the country’s state legislatures; and 
Whereas, in Senate Concurrent Resolution 
No. 4007, the regular session of the 44th Leg-
islative Assembly in 1975, responded by rati-
fying the proposed 1972 Equal Rights Amend-
ment to the Cnstitution of the United 
States; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of North Dakota, 
the House of Representatives concurring 
therein: 
That the 67th Legislative Assembly deems 
that the vitality of Senate Concurrent Reso-
lution No. 4007 of the 44th Legislative Assem-
bly by which North Dakota lawmakers rati-
fied the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment, offi-
cially lapsed at 11:59 p.m. on March 22, 1979; 
and be it further 
Resolved, that, after March 22, 1979, the 
Legislative Assembly, while in agreement 
women and men should enjoy equal rights in 
the eyes of the law, should not be counted by 
Congress, the Archivist of the United States, 
lawmakers in any other state, any court of 
law, or any other person, as still having on 
record a live ratification of the proposed 
Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States as was offered by 
House Joint Resolution No. 208 of the 92nd 
Congress on March 22, 1972; and be it further 
Resolved, that the 67th Legislative Assem-
bly respectfully requests the full and com-
plete verbatim text of this resolution be duly 
published in the United States Senate’s por-
tion of the Congressional Record, as an offi-
cial memorial to the United States Senate, 
and that this resolution be referred to the 
committee of the United States Senate with 
appropriate jurisdiction over its subject 
matter; and be it further 
Resolved, that the 67th Legislative Assem-
bly respectfully requests the substance of 
this resolution be duly entered in the United 
States House of Representatives’ portion of 
the Congressional Record, as an official me-
morial to the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, and that this resolution be re-
ferred to the committee of the United States 
House of Representatives with appropriate 
jurisdiction over its subject matter; and be it 
further 
Resolved, that the Secretary of State for-
ward copies of this resolution to the Vice 
President of the United States, the secretary

Senate; the Speaker, clerk, and parliamen-
tarian of the United States House of Rep-

RECOGNIZING THE UTAH DIAPER 
BANK 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I offer 
my recognition of the unique service of 
the Utah Diaper Bank to the people of 
Utah and, seecifically, to the children 
of our great State. Their service, now 
spanning nearly a decade, officially 
started in March 2013 when a few dedi-
cated individuals recognized the neces-
sity fof an organized, community-based 
approach to collecting and distributing 
diapers. Today, after years of careful 
planning and hard work, hundreds of 
thousands of diapers are being distrib-
uted throughout Utah to those who 
need them. 
Some years ago, Victor Velivis, a 
Utah information technology profes-
sional, was watching television when 
he noticed an vertisement placed by a 
crisis nursery. The nursery requested 
diapers, not to stockpile them, but be-
cause they were out—flat out—of dia-
pers. Vic donated what diapers he could 
and kept tabs on the nursery for a 
year. A year later, the same nursery 
ran out again. Puzzled, he set out to in-
vestigate. 
After investigating, Vic realized that 
safety-net programs such as the food 
stamp program and Special Supple-
mental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants and Children do not cover the 
cost of diapers. He also realized that 
low-income parents cannot take advan-
tage of free or subsidized childcare if 
they cannot afford to leave diapers at 
childcare centers. This prevents par-
ents from accessing daycare and pre-
vents them from being able to work or 
attend school on a consistent basis. 
Vic began. to think about alter-
natives. What about cloth diapers? he 
thought. He soon realized, however, 
that most people living in poverty do 
not have access to washing facilities. 
Thus, they are unable to use cloth dia-
pers for health and sanitary reasons. 
The more he learned, the more Vic 
realized how hard it can be for parents 
in need to put diapers on their chil-
dren. 
In some Utah families, children suf-
fer multiple days in the same diaper. 
Not only is this tremendously uncom-
fortable, it also puts the child at risk 
of serious illness and disease. In fact, 
according to one expert source, to pre-
vent complications, it is recommended 
that parents change their newborn 
baby’s diaper every 2 to 3 hours. That 
is 8 to 12 diapers each day; and, at 
about 25 cents per diaper, a total of 
nearly 100 dollars per month. But what 
if you can’t afford that? The Utah Dia-
per Bank was created to address this 
problem directly. 
The Utah Diaper Bank serves the 
needs of infants and young children by 
overseeing an organized approach to 
collecting and distributing diapers to 
organizations and individuals who need 
them. The bank fulfills this mission by 
supporting diaper drives, collecting and 
stockpiling diapers, and then distrib-
uting diapers throughout the State. 
What began as a loosely connected 
group of friends operating out of their 
homes, now operates out of a ware-
house and distributes hundreds of thou-
sands of diapers annually. 
The Covid–19 pandemic has exacer-
bated demand for the services provided 
by the Utah Diaper Bank. In early 2020, 
the Utah Diaper Bank was shipping 
50,000 diapers a month with a target of 
500,000–750,000 for the year. Then, once 
the pandemic had hit, they started 
shipping well over 100,000 per month. 
By the end of 2020, they had shipped 
over 880,000. They have never seen de-
mand for diapers like they are seeing 
now. Yet, they continue to succeed in 
fulfilling their mission. 
The most remarkable part of the op-
eration of the Utah Diaper Bank is 
that they operate without any paid 
staff. Their team is made up entirely of 
volunteers. Further, they receive nei-
ther private nor government grants 
and operate on a strict collection-dis-
tribution model. 
The folks at the Utah Diaper Bank 
undeniably 
deserve 
recognition 
for 
their devout service to the people of 
Utah. It is my unique privilege to 
honor them today.∑

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BOYS 
AND GIRLS CLUB OF YELLOW-
STONE COUNTY 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today, I 
rise to recognize the Boys and Girls 
Club of Yellowstone County for 50 
years of service to the Billings commu-
nity. 
The Boys and Girls Club of Yellow-
stone County first opened its doors in 
1971, serving 70 kids out of the base-
ment of the old public library in down-
town Billings. Over the past half cen-
tury, the club has grown to serve well 
over 500 kids and operates five club-
houses and five microsites across the 
Magic City. 
Throughout the pandemic, the club 
never stopped doing what it does best 
serving the kids who need it most. Like 
many other schools and organizations, 
the club initially had to close their 
doors when COVID–19 came to Mon-
tana. But they put in the hard work 
and managed to reopen carefully and 
safely so they could continue providing 
a welcoming place for kids to learn to-
gether, make lifelong friendships, and 
build skills and confidence that will 
serve them for the rest of their lives. I 
commend president and CEO Brian 
Dennis and his staff for navigating 
these challenging times and for their 
steadfast 
commitment 
to 
ensuring 
every child in our community is set up 
to succeed. 
The Boys and Girls Clubs of America 
challenge each and every one of us to 
reach our full potential and be great. 
For the past 50 years, the Yellowstone 
County club has done exactly that. 
Congratulations, thank you, and best 
of luck as you continue this truly com-
mendable work.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. PORTMAN): 
S. 1078. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Labor to award grants for 
promoting industry or sector partner-
ships to encourage industry growth and 
competitiveness and to improve worker 
training, retention, and advancement 
as part of an infrastructure invest-
ment; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, The U.S. 
Infrastructure system is in critical 
need of an upgrade. In February 2021, 
the American Society of Civil Engi-
neers (ASCE) graded 11 of 17 infrastruc-
ture categories a D+ or worse. Systems 
across the Nation are in dire need of re-
pair, including our bridges, public tran-
sit, roads, and schools. 
A recent study by the Center of Edu-
cation and the Workforce at George-
town University estimated that a $1.5 
trillion 
infrastructure 
investment 
would create 15 million new jobs. Near-
ly half of these would require training 
past the high school level. Even with-
out a significant investment, though, 
infrastructure industries are already 
struggling to meet workforce demands. 
Though the need to invest in infra-
structure goes back decades, there’s re-
newed momentum today, especially as 
more than 10 million people remain un-
employed across the country as a re-
sult of COVID–19, exacerbating the al-
ready historic inequities that have lim-
ited women and people of color from 
accessing these jobs. Investments in in-
frastructure skills training must serve 
people of color, women, and other com-
munities who have historically been 
excluded from good careers in infra-
structure. 
Industry and sector partnerships are 
a proven strategy for helping workers 
prepare for jobs that lead to strong ca-
reer pathways and helping businesses 
find skilled workers. Congress requires 
states and local areas to support the 
development 
of 
these 
partnerships 
under the Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act (WIOA), but no dedi-
cated funding has been provided for 
these activities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1897 
April 13, 2021 
For workers, especially those under-
represented in infrastructure indus-
tries, support services like career coun-
seling, child care, and transportation 
can often be the key to succeed in 
work-based learning programs. Pro-
viding these services may be outside 
the capacity of a business. Industry 
partnerships bring business together 
with community and human service or-
ganizations that can make these con-
nections for workers and drastically 
improve their ability to succeed in 
training and meet business demand for 
skilled workers. 
This is why I am pleased to introduce 
with my colleague, Senator PORTMAN, 
the Building U.S. Infrastructure by 
Leveraging Demands for Skills Act, or 
BUILDS Act. The BUILDS Act creates 
a grant program that would support in-
dustry and sector partnerships working 
with local businesses, industry associa-
tions and organizations, labor organi-
zations, state and local workforce 
boards, economic development agencies 
and other partners engaged in their 
communities to encourage industry 
growth, competitiveness and collabora-
tion to improve worker training, reten-
tion and advancement in targeted in-
frastructure 
clusters. 
Additionally, 
businesses 
and 
education 
providers 
would be connected to develop class-
room curriculum to complement on- 
the-job learning and workers would re-
ceive support services such as men-
toring and career counseling to ensure 
that they are successful from the pre- 
employment to placement in a full- 
time position. 
As we prepare to tackle critical in-
frastructure 
needs 
nationwide, 
it’s 
vital we also support a skilled work-
force that can take on this task. This 
bill will help foster strong industry 
partnerships and career pathways in 
infrastructure fields to ensure we can 
train and upskill workers for millions 
of good-paying jobs and also strengthen 
our economy as we begin to recover 
from COVID–19. I hope that my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle con-
sider the BUILDS Act as a necessary 
component to any investment in our 
nation’s infrastructure.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
149—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
CONGRESS 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT 
THE A–10 THUNDERBOLT II AT-
TACK 
AIRCRAFT 
PROGRAM, 
ALSO KNOWN AS THE WARTHOG 
AND A–10C OR OA–10C 
Mr. KELLY (for himself, Mr. BLUNT, 
and Ms. SINEMA) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Armed Services: 
S. RES. 149 
Whereas the A–10 Thunderbolt II attack 
aircraft (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘A–10’’)— 
(1) has seen action in every major United 
States Military conflict since the first pro-
duction A–10 was delivered to Davis-Monthan 
Air Force Base in October 1975; and 
(2) since that time, has received several up-
grades that are reflected in the 281 A–10s in 
service as of the date of adoption of this res-
olution; 
Whereas, since Operation Desert Storm in 
1991, the A–10 has become a preferred close 
air support platform for ground troops, 
striking fear in the enemies of the United 
States and inspiring pride in the members of 
the Armed Forces; 
Whereas the A–10, which has been the 
backbone of the close air support mission of 
the Air Force for more than 40 years, has 
proven to be a highly accurate, mobile, and 
durable weapons-delivery platform that can 
be used against all ground targets; 
Whereas the A–10 supports close air sup-
port with a variety of forward-firing, free- 
fall, and precision-guided munitions; 
Whereas the A–10 is able to perform com-
bat search and rescue, air interdiction, 
armed reconnaissance, suppression of enemy 
air defenses, special operations forces sup-
port, and countersea operations in low- 
threat and high-threat environments, day or 
night; 
Whereas the A–10 provides the Air Force 
with an extensive ability to survey the bat-
tlefield and then fix, engage, target, and de-
stroy a wide range of mobile and fixed tar-
gets as an arsenal aircraft, including tanks 
and other highly armored vehicles in quan-
tity; 
Whereas the A–10 was specifically designed 
with protection from small-arms fire, includ-
ing self-sealing fuel tanks, redundant flight 
controls, and a titanium cockpit tub, which 
has proven vital to the safe return of pilots 
despite heavy damage from enemy ground 
fire; 
Whereas the A–10 has the lowest rate of 
friendly fire incidents of any combat fighter 
or bomber; 
Whereas the A–10 has one of the largest 
carrying capacities for a fighter-type air-
craft and can carry a wide range of muni-
tions and electronic countermeasures with-
out sacrificing air-to-ground capabilities; 
Whereas the close air support provided by 
the A–10, which has proven invaluable on the 
battlefield, is better than the close air sup-
port provided by any other fighter aircraft 
because— 
(1) the A–10 has excellent maneuverability 
at low air speeds and altitudes; and 
(2) the close air support provided by the A– 
10 is simple and effective; 
Whereas the slower airspeeds of the A–10 
enable longer loiter times, increasing sup-
port to troops in contact and battlefield cov-
erage; 
Whereas, of all combat planes in the arse-
nal of the United States, the A–10 is the least 
expensive to operate and purchase; 
Whereas, while the A–10 flew only 30 per-
cent of the total sorties of the Air Force dur-
ing Operation Desert Storm in 1991, these 
aircraft achieved more than half of the con-
firmed Iraqi equipment losses and fired 90 
percent of the precision-guided Maverick 
missiles; 
Whereas, during Operation Allied Force in 
1999— 
(1) A–10s destroyed more field-deployed 
Serbian weaponry than any other allied 
weapon system; and 
(2) combat search and rescue support from 
the A–10 was 100 percent effective, success-
fully rescuing 1 F–117 pilot and 1 F–16CG 
pilot; 
Whereas, during Operation Enduring Free-
dom in 2001 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 
2003, the A–10 flew 32 percent of the combat 
sorties in both theaters, and from 2006 to late 
2013, the A–10 flew 19 percent of close air op-
erations in Iraq and Afghanistan; 
Whereas the A–10 is an effective close air 
support platform to counter violent extrem-
ist organizations, including the Islamic 
State in Iraq and Syria; 
Whereas the continuing demands for close 
air support in Iraq and Afghanistan keep the 
A–10 a relevant platform, but one that re-
quires upgrades; 
Whereas, if the A–10 is removed from serv-
ice, certain gaps in responsive close air sup-
port, forward air controller, air interdiction, 
strike control and reconnaissance, and com-
bat search and rescue support could widen; 
Whereas the A–10 can be serviced and oper-
ated with high sortie rates from austere 
bases with limited facilities or logistical 
support near battle areas, including unpre-
pared dirt, grass, and narrow road runways, 
and from airfields that are too short or 
rough to handle fast jets; 
Whereas global power is essential to pre-
serving global security and stability, and the 
A–10 is essential to ensuring that the United 
States is able to continue providing un-
matched airpower, to gain and maintain air 
superiority, and to extend its global reach; 
Whereas the A–10 program supports the Air 
Force, including the Air National Guard and 
Air Force Reserve; 
Whereas, as of the date of adoption of this 
resolution, the A–10 is flying in operational 
combat squadrons at— 
(1) Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ari-
zona; 
(2) Eglin Air Force Base, Florida; 
(3) Moody Air Force Base, Georgia; 
(4) Gowen Field Air National Guard Base, 
Idaho; 
(5) Fort Wayne Air National Guard Sta-
tion, Indiana; 
(6) Warfield Air National Guard Base, 
Maryland; 
(7) Selfridge Air National Guard Base, 
Michigan; 
(8) Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri; 
(9) Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada; and 
(10) Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea; 
Whereas the 355th Wing at Davis-Monthan 
Air Force Base, with an inventory of 84 A– 
10s— 
(1) has deployed 12 times since September 
11, 2001, primarily in support of troops on the 
ground; and 
(2) is responsible for training all A–10 pi-
lots; 
Whereas the 175th Wing at Warfield Air Na-
tional Guard Base, with an inventory of 21 
A–10s, has deployed 6 times since September 
11, 2001, primarily in support of troops on the 
ground; and 
Whereas the 442nd Fighter Wing at White-
man Air Force Base, with an inventory of 27 
A–10s, has deployed 9 times since September 
11, 2001, primarily in support of troops on the 
ground: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that Congress should continue to support the 
A–10 Thunderbolt II program in future fiscal 
years because— 
(1) continued support for the A–10 Thunder-
bolt II program is imperative to the national 
security of the United States; and 
(2) the United States cannot afford to risk 
its national security, or the national secu-
rity of its allies, by allowing that program to 
fall short of its vital mission.

ON 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
AND 
THE 
SECRETARY 
OF 
HEALTH 
AND HUMAN SERVICES TO TAKE 
ACTION 
TO 
LOWER 
PRESCRIP-
TION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. 
SANDERS, Ms. WARREN, and Mr. BOOK-
ER) submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 151 
Whereas the United States is facing a pan-
demic, and economic crisis, caused by the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) that 
threatens the health and financial well-being 
of nearly every family in the United States; 
Whereas even before the COVID–19 pan-
demic, consumers and patients in the United 
States were charged higher prices for pre-
scription drugs than consumers and patients 
in other countries around the world; 
Whereas families in the United States con-
tinue 
to 
face 
financial 
hardship 
from 
unaffordable out-of-pocket costs and higher 
premiums that have been exacerbated by an 
economic crisis and losses in employer-spon-
sored health coverage; 
Whereas 8 in 10 individuals in the United 
States say the cost of prescriptions is unrea-
sonable, and nearly 3 in 10 individuals across 
the United States are rationing their medi-
cine due to high prescription drug costs; 
Whereas the prescription drug cost crisis 
has put families at risk for poor health out-
comes, increasing the likelihood of complica-
tions from a severe case of COVID–19 for 
those families; 
Whereas even before the COVID–19 pan-
demic, people of color, including Black, 
Brown, and indigenous people, were dis-
proportionately impacted by high prescrip-
tion drug costs, which was due in part to a 
higher prevalence of chronic conditions in 
those populations that require expensive pre-
scription drugs; 
Whereas people of color, including Black, 
Brown, and indigenous people, are dying at 
much higher rates as a result of COVID–19, 
and other diseases, for which affordable pre-
scription drugs can and should be available; 
Whereas any price gouging by pharma-
ceutical companies is a root cause of health 
disparities in the United States; 
Whereas nearly 1 in 3 individuals in the 
United States facing increased prescription 
drug costs spend less on basic necessities, in-
cluding groceries, to account for that in-
creased prescription drug cost; 
Whereas approximately 25 percent of the 
monthly premium for a health care con-
sumer in the United States goes to prescrip-
tion drug costs; 
Whereas more than 1 in 4 health care con-
sumers decline other medical tests or proce-
dures, or put off a visit to the doctor’s office, 
because of increased prescription drug costs; 
Whereas pharmaceutical companies abuse 
monopoly control granted by the Federal 
Government, in the form of patents and reg-
ulatory exclusivities, to limit competition 
and raise prescription drug costs; 
Whereas 8 out of 10 new drug patents are 
for slight modifications to existing drugs, 
not for innovating new drug products; 
Whereas 9 out of 10 of the largest pharma-
ceutical companies spend more on sales and 
marketing than on researching new drugs; 
Whereas each of the 356 drugs approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration between 
2010 and 2019 was developed through tax-
payer-funded research conducted by the Na-
tional Institutes of Health; 
Whereas the 18 pharmaceutical companies 
on the S&P 500 spent more money on stock 
buybacks and dividends than on research and 
development between 2009 and 2018; 
Whereas the pharmaceutical and medical 
products industry spent $295,000,000 on lob-
bying in 2019, more than any other industry 
and nearly double the next closest industry; 
Whereas the pharmaceutical industry em-
ploys more lobbyists than there are Members 
of Congress; 
Whereas the 25 largest pharmaceutical 
companies in the United States achieve an 
average profit margin above 20 percent, more 
than twice the average profit margin of the 
other 500 largest companies in the United 
States; 
Whereas pharmaceutical spending growth 
in the United States is projected to outpace 
inflation for the foreseeable future; 
Whereas pharmaceutical companies raised 
the price of 245 drugs in the first 5 months of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, with the average 
price increase being 23.8 percent; 
Whereas 61 of the 245 prescription drugs 
that saw price hikes during the first months 
of the COVID–19 pandemic were being used to 
treat COVID–19, and another 30 drugs were 
undergoing clinical trials for use against 
that virus; 
Whereas nearly 9 in 10 adults in the United 
States said they were concerned the pharma-
ceutical industry would use the pandemic to 
raise prescription drug prices; 
Whereas the United States spends twice as 
much money on prescription drugs when 
compared to other economically-comparable 
countries, including Canada, France, and the 
United Kingdom, despite purchasing fewer 
drugs per individual; 
Whereas adults in the United States con-
sistently rank the pharmaceutical industry 
as their least liked industry, with the indus-
try being ranked less favorably than the oil, 
banking, and airline industries; 
Whereas 8 out of 10 adults in the United 
States say prescription drug costs are unrea-
sonable and driven by the desire for profits 
by pharmaceutical companies; 
Whereas the President can license generic 
competition with patented products when it 
is in the public interest, including to combat 
abusive price gouging by large pharma-
ceutical companies; 
Whereas the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services (referred to in this preamble 
as the ‘‘Secretary’’) can require reasonable 
pricing in return for receiving Federal fund-
ing and other support for research and devel-
opment; and 
Whereas the President and the Secretary 
can lower prescription drug prices under ex-
isting law and authorities: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the authority of the Presi-
dent and the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services (referred to in this resolution as the 
‘‘Secretary’’) to lower prescription drug 
prices; 
(2) calls on the President and the Secretary 
to take administrative action to lower pre-
scription drug prices under existing law and 
authorities, including— 
(A) Federal Government use, pursuant to 
section 1498(a) of title 28, United States 
Code; 
(B) march-in rights, pursuant to section 
203 of title 35, United States Code; 
(C) royalty-free rights, pursuant to sec-
tions 202(c)(4) and 209(d)(1) of title 35, United 
States Code; 
(D) the Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
Innovation, established by section 1115A(a)(1) 
of 
the 
Social 
Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 
1315a(a)(1)); and 
(E) all other existing law and authorities; 
and 
(3) encourages the President to use exist-
ing law and authorities to align prescription 
drug prices in the United States with drug 
prices in other economically-comparable 
countries, including Canada, France, the 
United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany.

submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 152 
Whereas William Francis Evans was born 
in North Adams, MA to Howard and Janice 
Evans; 
Whereas Officer Evans joined the United

after graduating from Western New England

Whereas Officer Evans served as a member

Whereas on the afternoon of April 2, 2021, 
Officer Evans was killed in the line of duty

and Ms. ROSEN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 153 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, Black women 
in the United States are 2 to 3 times more 
likely than white women to die from preg-
nancy-related causes; 
Whereas Black women in the United States 
suffer from life-threatening pregnancy com-
plications, 
known 
as 
‘‘maternal 
morbidities’’, twice as often as white women; 
Whereas maternal mortality rates in the 
United States are— 
(1) among the highest in the developed 
world; and 
(2) increasing rapidly; 
Whereas the United States has the highest 
maternal mortality rate among affluent 
countries, in part because of the dispropor-
tionate mortality rate among Black women; 
Whereas Black women are 49 percent more 
likely than white women to deliver pre-
maturely; 
Whereas the high rates of maternal mor-
tality among Black women span across— 
(1) income levels; 
(2) education levels; and 
(3) socioeconomic status; 
Whereas structural racism, gender oppres-
sion, and the social determinants of health 
inequities experienced by Black women in 
the United States significantly contribute to 
the disproportionately high rates of mater-
nal mortality and morbidity among Black 
women; 
Whereas racism and discrimination play a 
consequential 
role 
in 
the 
maternal 
healthcare experiences and outcomes of 
Black birthing people; 
Whereas a fair and wide distribution of re-
sources and birth options, especially with re-
gard to reproductive healthcare services and 
maternal health programming, are critical 
to closing the racial gap in maternal health 
outcomes; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has fur-
ther highlighted issues within the broken 
healthcare system in the United States and 
the harm of that system to Black women and 
birthing persons by exposing— 
(1) increased barriers to accessing prenatal 
and postpartum care, including maternal 
mental healthcare; 
(2) the lack of uniform hospital policies 
permitting doulas and support persons to be 
present during labor and delivery; 
(3) inconsistent hospital policies regarding 
the separation of the newborn from a mother 
that is suspected positive for COVID–19; 
(4) complexities in COVID–19 vaccine and 
therapeutics trials including pregnant and 
lactating people; 
(5) increased rates of caesarean section de-
liveries; 
(6) shortened hospital stays following de-
livery; 
(7) provider shortages and lack of suffi-
cient policies to allow home births attended 
by midwives; 
(8) insufficient practical support for deliv-
ery of care by midwives, including telehealth 
access; 
(9) adverse economic impact on Black 
mothers and families due to job loss or re-
duction in income during quarantine and the 
pandemic recession; and 
(10) 
pervasive 
racial 
injustice 
against 
Black people in the criminal justice, social, 
and healthcare systems; 
Whereas, even as there is growing concern 
about improving access to mental health 
services, Black women are least likely to 
have access to mental health screenings, 
treatment, and support before, during, and 
after pregnancy; 
Whereas justice-informed, culturally con-
gruent models of care are beneficial to Black 
women; and 
Whereas an investment must be made in— 
(1) maternity care for Black women and 
birthing persons, including support of care 
led by the communities most affected by the 
maternal health crisis in the United States; 
(2) continuous health insurance coverage 
to support Black women and birthing per-
sons for the full postpartum period up to at 
least 1 year after giving birth; and 
(3) policies that support and promote af-
fordable, comprehensive, and holistic mater-
nal healthcare that is free from gender and 
racial discrimination, regardless of incarcer-
ation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes— 
(1) that Black women are experiencing 
high, disproportionate rates of maternal 
mortality and morbidity in the United 
States; 
(2) that the alarmingly high rates of ma-
ternal mortality and morbidity among Black 
women are unacceptable; 
(3) that, in order to better mitigate the ef-
fects of systemic and structural racism, Con-
gress must work toward ensuring that the 
Black community has— 
(A) safe and affordable housing; 
(B) transportation equity; 
(C) nutritious food; 
(D) clean air and water; 
(E) environments free from toxins; 
(F) fair treatment within the criminal jus-
tice system; 
(G) safety and freedom from violence; 
(H) a living wage; 
(I) equal economic opportunity; 
(J) a sustained workforce pipeline for di-
verse perinatal professionals; and 
(K) comprehensive, quality, and affordable 
healthcare with access to the full spectrum 
of reproductive care; 
(4) that, in order to improve maternal 
health outcomes, Congress must fully sup-
port and encourage policies grounded in the 
human 
rights 
and 
reproductive 
justice 
frameworks that address Black maternal 
health inequity; 
(5) that Black women and birthing persons 
must be active participants in the policy de-
cisions that impact their lives; 
(6) that, in order to ensure access to safe 
and respectful maternal healthcare for Black 
women and birthing persons, Congress must 
pass the Black Maternal Health Momnibus 
Act of 2021; 
(7) that Black Maternal Health Week is an 
opportunity to— 
(A) raise national awareness of the state of 
Black maternal health in the United States; 
(B) amplify the voices of Black women and 
birthing persons, families, and communities; 
(C) serve as a national platform for— 
(i) entities led by Black women; and 
(ii) efforts on maternal health; and 
(D) enhance community organizing on 
Black maternal health; and 
(8) the significance of April 11 through 
April 17, 2021, as ‘‘Black Maternal Health 
Week’’.

GRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF 
THE 
HASHEMITE 
KINGDOM 
OF 
JORDAN ON THE CENTENNIAL OF 
THE 
FOUNDING 
OF 
THE 
JOR-
DANIAN STATE 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN (for himself and 
Mr. HAGERTY) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 154 
Whereas the late King Abdullah bin Al 
Hussein arrived in Amman on March 2, 1921, 
and began working to establish a political 
system based on the Arab demand for inde-
pendence, reaffirming the renaissance ap-
proach spearheaded by his father, Al Hussein 
bin Ali; 
Whereas the Amirate of Trans-Jordan was 
established on April 11, 1921; 
Whereas the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 
achieved independence on May 25, 1946; 
Whereas the United States recognized Jor-
dan as an independent state in a White 
House announcement on January 31, 1949; 
Whereas 
the 
United 
States 
and 
the 
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan have main-
tained diplomatic relations since 1949, and 
during this 72-year partnership, the United 
States and Jordan have continued to develop 
a close relationship in security, economic de-
velopment, and counterterrorism coopera-
tion; 
Whereas the economic partnership between 
the United States and Jordan was further 
strengthened by the signing of the United 
States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement on Oc-
tober 24, 2000, which was fully implemented 
on January 1, 2010; 
Whereas the United States is committed to 
Jordan’s stability, prosperity, and security 
throughout the years, which has been re-
flected in 3 memoranda of understanding 
covering fiscal years 2010 through 2022, which 
demonstrate a strong, multi-year strategic 
relationship between the 2 countries; 
Whereas Jordan continues to host 53 na-
tionalities of refugees and is home to the 
second highest number of refugees per capita 
globally, with more than 1,300,000 Syrians, 
660,000 United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees-registered refugees, and mil-
lions of Palestinian refugees; and 
Whereas King Abdullah II has been a lead-
ing Arab voice in moderation and interfaith 
dialogue, by spearheading initiatives such as 
‘‘A Common Word’’ and the 2004 ‘‘Amman 
Message’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the centennial of the es-
tablishment of the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan; 
(2) expresses its profound admiration and 
gratitude for the friendship of the Jordanian 
people, who continue to demonstrate great 
generosity for those in need; 
(3) shares the hope of His Majesty King 
Abdullah II and the Jordanian people for a 
more peaceful Middle East; and 
(4) looks forward to our continued close co-
operation with His Majesty King Abdullah II 
and Jordan on our shared priorities of secu-
rity, economic development, and humani-
tarian issues.

IN RECOGNITION AND HONOR OF 
THE LIFE OF DR. BERNARDINE 
LACEY 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 13, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to rec-
ognize the life and legacy of my dear friend, 
Dr. Bernardine Lacey, who passed away on 
March 26, 2021. It is with deep sorrow that I 
mourn her loss, and deep affection that I 
honor her beautiful legacy. 
Dr. Lacey was born on July 28, 1932, in 
Vicksburg, Mississippi. Despite her humble be-
ginnings, she successfully went on to build a 
formidable and impactful career in the nursing 
profession. Dr. Lacey’s expansive education 
began when she received her nursing degree 
from the Gilfoy School of Nursing at the Mis-
sissippi Baptist Hospital in Jackson. This 
would be one of the first of many pioneering 
efforts Dr. Lacey would trailblaze to break bar-
riers as one of the first Black students admit-
ted into Georgetown University’s Nursing pro-
gram, where she completed her Bachelor of 
Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) in 1969. There-
after, Dr. Lacey earned her Master of Arts 
from Howard University in 1985. Her tenacity 
did not allow her to stop there. She would go 
on to earn her terminal degree in her 50’s with 
her Doctor of Education from the prestigious 
Columbia University’s Teacher’s College in 
1991. 
Throughout her career path, Dr. Lacey 
served Howard University Hospital for more 
than 30 years. While there is a robust list of 
accomplishments that are too many to exhaust 
here, to name a few, Dr. Lacey became the 
Founding Dean and Professor at Western 
Michigan University’s School of Nursing, 
where she remained until 1999. Thereafter, 
she went on to act as Special Assistant to the 
President of Western Michigan University. 
Other notable titles held include: Professor 
and Chair in the Department of Nursing at 
Prince George’s Community College; Execu-
tive Director of Children’s National Medical 
Center, School Health Program; and Chair-
person in the Department of Nursing at Bowie 
State University. In 2018, coming out of retire-
ment, Dr. Lacey was led back to Howard Uni-
versity, where she served as Vice-Chair for 
the College of Nursing and Allied Health 
Sciences. In this role, she acted as a trusted 
advisor to the Dean, worked to expand clinical 
affiliations, and established best practices for 
accreditation visits and scholarship and grant 
opportunities. 
Throughout her 88-years of living life to the 
fullest, Dr. Lacey received numerous acco-
lades—which are tangible testaments to her 
undeniable impact on the intersection of nurs-
ing and our nursing education communities. 
Dr. Lacey became a Fellow of the American 
Academy of Nursing; was honored as a Distin-
guished Alumna at Georgetown University; a 
recipient of the Legacy of Leadership Award 
from Howard University; and in 2014, Dr. 
Lacey was inducted as a ‘‘Living Legend’’ by 
the American Academy of Nursing where they 
inducted her into the Academy’s Hall of Fame. 
In addition, the College of Nursing and Allied 
Health Sciences at Howard University will con-
tinue to recognize Dr. Lacey’s impact by initi-
ating an annual ‘‘Bernardine M. Lacey Re-
search Day,’’ to be established next year. 
Dr. Lacey’s significant contributions to the 
field of nursing and public health are widely 
appreciated by a host of colleagues, friends, 
and students. In addition to her professional 
accomplishments, Dr. Lacey walked with time-
less class, grace, style, and courage, all while 
quick to offer a warm smile. Most especially, 
I am grateful to Dr. Lacey for the guidance 
and support as my application sponsor that 
she provided to me upon my 2020 induction 
as a Fellow to the American Academy of 
Nursing. Dr. Lacey served as an enduring 
connection between my office and the nursing 
community. 
Madam Speaker, allow me this moment to 
express condolences to Dr. Lacey’s family, 
friends, and colleagues. Though her presence 
will be sorely missed by many, including my-
self, I pray that we may find solace in remem-
bering her legacy for years to come.

MADE IN AMERICA ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 13, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce the ‘‘Made in America Act’’ with 
U.S. Senator TAMMY BALDWIN (D–WI). Our bi-
cameral and bipartisan bill would strengthen 
‘‘Buy America’’ requirements for all major fed-
eral infrastructure programs, including feder-
ally funded highway, rail, transit, aviation, 
levee, and water projects. 
The ‘‘Made in America Act’’ identifies federal 
programs that fund infrastructure not currently 
subject to ‘‘Buy America’’ standards and en-
sures that building materials used in these tax-
payer-funded projects are produced domesti-
cally. When setting standards to determine 
which materials used in construction will be 
considered ‘‘Made in America,’’ the bill re-
quires the Department of Commerce to ensure 
that their manufacturing processes support 
American jobs. 
Congress is poised to make the most signifi-
cant investment in our nation’s infrastructure in 
nearly half a century. This is a once-in-a-gen-
eration opportunity to advance commonsense 
‘‘Buy America’’ and ‘‘Make it in America’’ poli-
cies to rebuild and modernize our nation’s 
crumbling infrastructure. In the process, we 
will create thousands of well-paying jobs that 
can never be outsourced and make America 
competitive in the 21st century. 
Unfortunately, numerous Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) reports have con-
firmed that many of our nation’s existing trade 
obligations often provide trading partners more 
opportunity to win American government pro-
curement work than American businesses re-
ceive in return. The ‘‘Made in America Act’’ 
would take steps to correct this imbalance by 
ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent on 
American-made materials created by Amer-
ican workers and businesses. 
Madam Speaker, Americans are right to ex-
pect that taxpayer dollars spent on infrastruc-
ture projects support domestic manufacturing. 
I want to thank my House colleagues for their 
support as the bill’s original cosponsors. I urge 
all Members to join us is cosponsoring this 
critical legislation. As a senior member of the 
House Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure, I plan to make the ‘‘Made in Amer-
ica Act’’ a majority priority in the 2021 surface 
transportation reauthorization and any infra-
structure package.

Born May 2, 1947 in Gary, Indiana, Gerald

both on and off of the football field, serving as 
captain of the football team and as student 
government vice president. 
After being selected in the third round of the 
1970 draft by the Oakland Raiders, Gerald 
continued his run of excellence at the profes-
sional level. After six years starting at line-
backer for the Raiders, Gerald spent four 
years with the Cleveland Browns before retir-
ing in 1980. Named an ‘‘Oakland Raiders Leg-
end, ‘‘listed among the ‘‘100 Greatest Cleve-
land Browns’’ of all time, and named to the In-
diana Football Hall of Fame in 2013, Gerald’s 
athletic career proved truly remarkable. 
Even so, his time off the field proved as 
noteworthy as his time on it. During the off 
seasons of his NFL career, he continued his 
pursuit of education, earning a master’s de-
gree in Business Administration from the Uni-
versity of Chicago. Gerald put his skills and 
experiences to quick use. He spent a distin-
guished 32 years working with The Woodlands 
Development Company, helping hundreds of 
businesses relocate to The Woodlands. Ger-
ald also served for 22 years on the Conroe 
ISD Board of Trustees during a period which 
saw student enrollment double. Because of his 
continued commitment to enhancing edu-
cational opportunities for others, Gerald D. 
Irons, Sr. Junior High School was named in 
his honor. 
Gerald and his family were a driving force 
behind the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
Celebration and Drum Major Awards held 
each January in the Woodlands. Gerald was 
integral to the founding of Impact Church in 
the Woodlands where he served as an elder. 
Due to their exemplary lives of active involve-
ment in the community, the Irons were named 
Hometown Heroes. 
In the words of his family, ‘‘He lived a life of 
service to his family, church and community; 
to know Gerald was truly to love Gerald.’’ Ger-
ald is remembered by his loving wife, Myrna, 
and many loving children and grandchildren. 
I join the entire community in honoring Ger-
ald Irons for his dedicated life of service to 
others. His amazing legacy will always be 
cherished in our community.

WUHAN WHITEWASH 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 13, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, incredibly revealing is the editorial in 
The Wall Street Journal on March 31, 2021 
opposing The Wuhan Virus Whitewash. The 
unintended consequence of the blatant mis-
representation in the Wuhan Report is to fur-
ther verify COVID–19 originated at the Wuhan 
Virology Institute leading to over three million 
deaths worldwide. 
The World Health Organization on Tuesday 
finally released its report on the origins of 
the coronavirus, and the result wasn’t worth 
the wait. The document is best understood as 
a whitewash heavily influenced by the Chi-
nese Communist Party and Westerners with 
conflicts of interest. 
The report—based primarily on an inter-
national team’s visit this year to the city of 
Wuhan, where Covid–19 was first detected— 
has little new information. 
In 2018 U.S. officials warned in diplomatic 
cables about safety and management issues 
at the Wuhan Virology Institute that could 
lead to a pandemic. 
The U.S. State Department warned in a 
January fact sheet that WIV researchers had 
developed ‘‘symptoms consistent with both 
COVID–19 and common seasonal illnesses’’ in 
autumn 2019. 
Even the WHO recognizes the implau-
sibility of the report. ‘‘I do not believe that 
this assessment was extensive enough. Fur-
ther data and studies will be needed to reach 
more robust conclusions,’’ WHO director- 
general Tedros Ghebreyesus said Tuesday. 
The U.S. and 13 other governments re-
leased 
a 
statement 
Tuesday 
expressing 
‘‘shared concerns’’ that the WHO study ‘‘was 
significantly delayed and lacked access to 
complete, original data and samples.’’ 
That shouldn’t be the end of it. The Biden 
Administration knows the underlying intel-
ligence and should release it to the public. 
The Biden Administration says it wants to 
revitalize multilateral institutions, and that 
should start with refusing to accept the 
WHO’s Wuhan whitewash.

the history of Puerto Rico is rich with exam-

whose accomplishments inspire us today and 
draw the attention of the world to our Island. 
But one group stands out as an institution 
whose efforts enrich the enduring legacy and 
might of the U.S. military, and has left an in-
delible mark on all Puerto Ricans and in the 
history of our nation and the world. The 65th 
Infantry Regiment is this institution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E377 
April 13, 2021 
After the change of sovereignty as result of 
the Spanish American War of 1899, a military 
unit was recruited from the Puerto Rico resi-
dents and organized into the ‘‘Regimiento de 
Voluntarios Puertorriquen˜ios’’. In 1908 was re-
organized into a Regular Army Unit of the U.S. 
and in 1920 was given the numerical designa-
tion of 65th Infantry, United States Army. How-
ever, what best identifies the regiment is not 
its numerical designation, but the name cho-
sen by its members while en route to the bat-
tlefields of Korea in 1950; Borinqueneers. 
Organized at the dawn of the 20th Century, 
the Borinqueneers matured in the service of 
Puerto Rico and the nation, secured the Pan-
ama Canal during WWI, was baptized by fire 
during the liberation of Europe in WWII, and 
was tempered by the conflagration of the Ko-
rean War. In the hilltops and valleys of that 
besieged land their valor and courage, as ex-
emplified by men like SFC Modesto Cartagena 
the most decorated Hispanic soldier of the Ko-
rean War, secured their place in history. In 
1960, the colors of the 65th Infantry Regiment 
were transferred to the Puerto Rico Army Na-
tional Guard, where their successors continue 
to serve and preserve the history and honor of 
the regiment. 
For 121 years the Borinqueneers never 
wavered in their resolve to give its best in the 
service of Puerto Rico and the nation. Over-
coming the social norms of its time and with-
out full representation in the U.S. Congress, 
as deserved by all American citizens, the 
Borinqueneers persevered and are an inspira-
tion to all of us. 
Today, April 13, 2021 as we commemorate 
the first National Borinqueneers Day—an ini-
tiative that I am proud to have led along with 
Senators SCOTT and RUBIO, and Representa-
tive MURPHY—I call on this body and all the 
citizens of our great nation to be inspired by 
their example and work together to overcome 
the challenges that we face.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN 
HON. DEAN PHILLIPS 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 13, 2021 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the service of my friend and col-
league, Rep. JAMIE RASKIN, in the face of trag-
edy and tremendously difficult circumstances, 
by offering a column written by one of my con-
stituents, Kurtis Meyer. 
[From the St. Ansgar Enterprise Journal] 
(By Kurtis Meyer) 
Until recently, I hadn’t paid much atten-
tion to Congressman Jamie Raskin from 
Maryland. I had seen him a few times on TV 
news programs, but the House of Representa-
tives generally rewards seniority instead of 
ability. Since Congressman Raskin was first 
elected in 2016, he was lacking in the cat-
egory that often earns Washington status 
and power. 
Several months ago, in late 2020, Congress-
man Raskin’s world was altered suddenly 
and dramatically. His son, Tommy, a second- 
year law student at Harvard, one of three 
Raskin children, took his life, succumbing to 
depression. His burial was on January 5th. 
We all know what happened in Washington 
the next day, January 6th, when Congress-
man Raskin, his daughter and his son-in-law 
were in the Capitol, awaiting the historic 
moment when Electoral College results 
would be read. After literally fearing for 
their lives, in the aftermath of what—the up-
rising? the insurrection?—Speaker Pelosi 
asked Jamie Raskin to serve as the House’s 
lead impeachment manager, a process rooted 
in the events of January 6. 
I track closely on politics. It’s has been an 
animating force in my life for four decades. 
While political campaigns are too long, too 
expensive, and too contentious, I engage in 
these battles, advocating on behalf of can-
didates I hope will serve our community, our 
state, and our nation with integrity. Today, 
however, I seek not to shed light on a polit-
ical race, but rather to shine light on the 
human race, specifically, the strength, cour-
age, and resilience of Congressman Jamie 
Raskin. 
Last New Year’s Eve, he gained member-
ship in a club no one ever hopes to join: 
those who experience the loss of a child. This 
tragedy grew out of perhaps the least under-
stood cause of death, soul-crushing depres-
sion. I didn’t know 25-year old Tommy 
Raskin but have read tributes to him by 
those who did, including his family. Here’s 
an excerpt from their capture of this young 
man’s life: 
Tommy entered the world like a blue-eyed 
cherub, a little angel (and) grew up as a 
strikingly beautiful curly-haired madcap boy 
beaming with laughter and charm, making 
mischief, kicking the soccer ball in the goal, 
acting out scenes from ‘To Kill A Mocking-
bird’ with his little sister . . . teaching other 
children the names of all the Justices on the 
Supreme Court, hugging strangers on the 
street, teaching our dogs foreign languages, 
running up and down the aisle on airplanes 
giving people high fives. 
He hated cliques and social snobbery and 
never had a negative word for anyone but ty-
rants and despots, and opposed all malicious 
gossip, stopping all such gossipers with a 
trademark Tommy line—‘forgive me, but it’s 
hard to be a human.’ 
Tommy had a perfect heart, a perfect soul, 
a riotously outrageous and relentless sense 
of humor, and a dazzling radiant mind. He 
began to be tortured later in his 20s by a 
blindingly painful and merciless disease 
called depression that became unbearable for 
him, despite very fine doctors and a loving 
family. In a brief note to his parents: ‘Please 
forgive me. My illness won today. Please 
look after each other, the animals, and the 
global poor for me. All my love, Tommy.’ 
I struggle to fathom the devastation 
caused by a child’s death. I have watched, 
from both near and far, as others have faced 
this horrific challenge and am in awe of 
those who endure with grace and determina-
tion. Earlier this month, during a remark-
ably difficult time in our country’s history, 
Congressman Raskin and his colleagues ad-
vanced the case for impeachment with dig-
nity and reason. With the shadow of death 
still all too fresh, Jamie Raskin was a model 
of character in service to our nation. 
As the Congressman is fond of saying, 
‘‘Change is made by people who show up.’’ 
Under 
the 
most 
difficult 
circumstances 
imaginable, Jamie Raskin showed up. I know 
of no better example of an elected official re-
sponding to duty, of placing service before 
self. In doing so, Congressman Raskin cast a 
bright ray of hope . . . that despite myriad 
challenges, our great country can continue 
as a beacon of enlightened democracy.

RESOLUTION CELEBRATING 
VAISAKHI 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 13, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce the House resolution celebrating 
Vaisakhi: an annual harvest festival widely 
celebrated in northern India and throughout 
the world. 
This resolution recognizes the historic, cul-
tural, and religious significance of the festival 
of Vaisakhi. This annual harvest festival is 
celebrated globally by people of many different 
faiths including Sikhs, Hindus, and Buddhists. 
It is particularly significant for Sikhs because it 
coincides with the formation of Khalsa in 1699. 
In the United States, Vaisakhi is celebrated 
with large processions, celebrations, and com-
munity service. Vaisakhi celebrates commu-
nity, prosperity, and continued progress in the 
year ahead. As our country emerges from the 
COVID–19 pandemic, it is critical that we cele-
brate the strength of our communities and the 
sacrifice it will take to defeat the coronavirus 
and look toward the future. 
As the co-chairman of the American Sikh 
Congressional Caucus, I am honored to re-
introduce this biennial resolution recognizing 
the importance of Vaisakhi. April 13 marks the 
start of the beginning of the Sikh religion and 
the start of the Punjabi New Year. Late 2020 
and early 2021 has tested the Indian Sikh 
community, and I hope the coming months will 
be marked by peace, prosperity, and respect 
for all faith communities. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members 
of the House to join me in recognizing the sig-
nificance of Vaisakhi and those who celebrate 
it.

Tuesday, April 13, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Kathryn 
Woodcock for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Kathryn Woodcock is a student at Arvada 
West H.S. and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Kathryn 
Woodcock is exemplary of the type of 
achievement that can be attained with hard 
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of 
their education and develop a work ethic 
which will guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Kathryn Woodcock for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt she will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments.

APPRECIATING BILL BROCK 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 13, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, The Wall Street Journal on March 
31, 2021, published a fitting tribute to Ambas-
sador William ‘‘Bill’’ Emerson Brock, III, who 
died on March 25th. 
General, Executive, Representative, Sen-
ator, National Chairman, Ambassador, Cabinet 
Secretary, Senior Counselor Bill Brock was 
correctly recognized as ‘‘a statesman of the 
highest caliber, leading by example, with free-
dom and humility.’’ 
I especially appreciate his achievements of 
developing the modern Republican Party in 
the South from virtually no presence to my 
home state of South Carolina now appre-
ciating the largest Republican majorities in 140 
years. 
His obituary from The Journal is clearly de-
serving for his service for the American peo-
ple. 
IN MEMORIAM 
West Palm Beach—BROCK, William Emer-
son III ‘‘Bill,’’ former Tennessee Senator, 
United States Trade Representative and Sec-
retary of Labor, passed away peacefully at 
the age of 90 on March 25, 2021. 
Born and raised in Chattanooga, TN, Bill 
Brock graduated from McCallie School and 
Washington & Lee University. When Mr. 
Brock returned from serving 3 years in the 
Navy, he went to work in his family’s candy 
company. Mr. Brock served in the House for 
8 years, working closely with Republicans 
and Democrats to solve problems and get 
things done for his constituents. 
In 1970, Mr. Brock ran against three-term 
incumbent Albert Gore, Sr. for the Senate 
and won. In 1976, as he was elected to serve 
as Chair of the Republican National Com-
mittee and spent the next 4 years rebuilding 
the Grand Ole Party. Four years later, the 
Republicans took control of the senate for 
the first time in a quarter of a century, 
gained 49 seats in the House of Representa-
tives, and elected Ronald Reagan to the 
Presidency. Reagan appointed Brock United 
States Trade Representative. He was recog-
nized for his leadership in promoting the ex-
pansion of international trade rules to en-
compass for the first time intellectual prop-
erty, services, and investment. He founded 
the Quad Forum, a quarterly informal meet-
ing of the Trade Ministers of Europe, Japan, 
Canada, and the United States and founded 
the Rio Group of seventeen leading trading 
nations to facilitate greater coordination be-
tween trade and finance ministries. Ambas-
sador Brock was recognized by The Wall 
Street Journal, along with a number of oth-
ers, as one of the ‘‘fathers’’ of the Uruguay 
Round of Trade Negotiations and subse-
quently 
the 
World 
Trade 
Organization 
(WTO). 
In 1985, President Reagan asked Mr. Brock 
to bring his arbitration skills to the Depart-
ment of Labor. As US Secretary of Labor, 
Secretary Brock was widely praised for his 
strong executive leadership in a major re-
form of pension laws, restoring constructive 
labor-management relations, and creating 
the landmark study of workforce and work-
place trends in a global economy entitled 
Work Force 2000. 
He was a Senior Counselor and Member of 
the Board of the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, where he chaired the 
International Policy Roundtable, served on 
several boards, traveled extensively with his 
wife and family, maintained an active twit-
ter account and continued to write op-eds on 
education, trade, policy and politics right up 
until the time of his passing. His family and 
friends will remember him for his gentle, 
loving spirit and his abiding commitment to 
his Father, his family, and his country. He 
was a statesman of the highest caliber, lead-
ing by example, with kindness and humility. 
Mr. Brock is predeceased by his mother, 
Myra Kruesi ‘‘Peggy’’ Brock, his father, Wil-
liam Emerson ‘‘Bill’’ Brock Jr., and by his 
wife, Laura Handley ‘‘Muffet’’ Brock. He is 
survived by his wife, Sandra Schubert 
‘‘Sandy’’ Brock; two brothers, Paul ‘‘Pat’’ 
Brock and Frank Brock; six children and 
step-children and their spouses, William 
‘‘Bill’’ Brock IV (Laura), Oscar Brock (Meg),

have shown incredible resolve in the face of 
adversity. They have shown us all how to 
seek positivity and hope in each day as we 
weather the storms that come our way. 
I couldn’t be more thankful to represent the 
incredible people across South Dakota and all 
over the nation who work hard each day, not 
for fame, not for recognition or for money, but 
for the betterment of their communities. This is 
what makes America strong. I am grateful for 
the opportunity to recognize these hard-
working individuals.

MAXIM G. LOMANOV 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 13, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Maxim G. 
Lomanov for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Maxim G. Lomanov is a student at Ralston 
Valley H.S. and received this award because 
his determination and hard work have allowed 
him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Maxim G. 
Lomanov is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Maxim G. Lomanov for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt he will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of his fu-
ture accomplishments.
