CONGRATULATING SHEILA DACEY 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 21, 2022 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the distinguished career and retire-
ment of Sheila Dacey after 26 years of service 
at the Congressional Budget Office. Sheila 
has been Chief of the Income Security and 
Education Cost Estimates Unit in CBO’s Budg-
et Analysis Division since 2015, following two 
decades as an analyst in that unit. Sheila 
served in numerous capacities as an analyst, 
including long stints analyzing welfare pro-
grams and Social Security. 
It is hard to overstate Sheila’s role in ana-
lyzing the budgetary impacts of income secu-
rity legislation over the past two decades. 
Sheila was instrumental in providing insightful 
and objective estimates of the effects of much 
of the important income security legislation 
that the Congress has considered, debated, 
and enacted since 1995. Notable examples in-
clude the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, subse-
quent changes to the Temporary Assistance to 
Needy Families program, numerous bills to im-
prove child support enforcement, and legisla-
tion affecting Social Security benefits. As a 
unit chief, she was instrumental in managing 
CBO’s work related to unemployment insur-
ance benefits provided during the COVID pan-
demic. 
Sheila has worked tirelessly with Members 
of Congress and staff on both sides of the 
aisle throughout the years. During many hours 
of discussion and patient explanation, she was 
always methodically forthright and fair, em-
bodying CBO’s commitment to nonpartisan 
analysis. She helped us understand the key 
levers to move an estimate and the need to 
focus on making the language match the in-
tent. 
Sheila has been a mentor and guide to nu-
merous analysts at CBO. Thanks to her ef-
forts, those analysts have learned to dig deep-
er and consider all the possible outcomes of 
a bill. The high standards that she set for her-
self and for other analysts will continue to be 
a benchmark for CBO’s analysis going for-
ward. 
On behalf of the House Budget Committee, 
I thank Sheila for her years of dedicated serv-
ice to the Congress and extend to her our 
best wishes for a well-earned retirement.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
BERTHA HENRY 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 21, 2022 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
recognize the tremendous career and mean-
ingful work of Bertha Henry, Broward County 
Administrator. 
Broward County is a sprawling and culturally 
diverse metropolitan coastal community in the 
heart of South Florida, spanning from the 
ocean to the Everglades, with 1.8 million resi-
dents in 31 municipalities. Ms. Henry’s com-
mitment to Broward County’s families and 
businesses has been extensive, impressive, 
and inspiring. 
Bertha Henry graduated from Florida State 
University with a bachelor’s degree in Govern-
ment and Business Management, and a mas-
ter’s degree in Public Administration. One of 
her fondest memories was watching her par-
ents smile with pride to see their daughter 
graduate with a master’s degree, particularly 
since neither of her parents were able to com-
plete their education. Ms. Henry’s can-do atti-
tude has guided her and served her well, both 
personally and professionally. 
Her professional career in public service in-
cludes her native City of Miami, Florida, Day-
ton (Montgomery County), Ohio, and Broward 
County, where she was named County Admin-
istrator in 2008. 
Under Ms. Henry’s leadership, Broward 
County has received numerous awards and 
recognitions. Some highlights include Fort 
Lauderdale/Hollywood 
International 
Airport 
being ranked third on the list of best large air-
ports in the country; receiving the Smart 
Growth Partnership Excellence Award for a 
safe, convenient, and sustainable transpor-
tation system; being awarded the Keep Amer-
ica Beautiful President’s Circle Award for ex-
emplary performance in building and sus-
taining vibrant communities; and Broward 
County’s Port Everglades receiving the Port of 
the Year and Best Domestic Departure Port 
Award. 
Bertha Henry is a selfless, compassionate, 
and devoted public servant whose commit-
ment to our community is exemplary, and I am 
proud to call her my dear friend. I wish her a 
heartfelt congratulations on her retirement and 
am grateful for her invaluable work to improve 
the lives of those in Florida’s 23rd Congres-
sional District, Broward County, and beyond.

CONGRATULATING SIMONE 
THOMAS 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 21, 2022 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the outstanding service and con-
tributions of Simone Thomas, who is retiring 
after 37 years as a skilled and dedicated pub-
lic servant at the Congressional Budget Office. 
For many years at CBO, Simone has served 
as a trusted, expert adviser to senior manage-
ment and staff on the most effective use of the 
agency’s intra net and new communications 
tools. She has been the driving force spurring 
intranet enhancements and innovations that 
have made it easier for staff to collaborate on 
analytical work for the Congress, such as 
CBO’s periodic volume of budget options. 
She has made significant contributions to 
enhance internal communications as CBO’s 
SharePoint Administrator, enabling CBO’s staff 
to stay better connected and informed. She 
has distinguished herself with her hard work 
and resourcefulness during the pandemic. She 
came up with creative ways to instruct CBO’s 
staff in the use of new communications tools 
to help them work more effectively on a re-
mote basis. 
Simone’s expertise also extends to CBO’s 
public website. She was responsible over the 
years for publishing time-sensitive, high-profile 
cost estimates as well as the agency’s major 
recurring reports. That work sometimes re-
quired working during the evening or on week-
ends, which Simone always took in stride. 
To her colleagues, Simone has been a con-
stant source of knowledge, support, and kind-
ness. She has received accolades over the 
years for her prompt customer service, pa-
tience, reliability, and ingenuity in trouble-
shooting complex SharePoint challenges. 
She is a consummate professional, always 
seeking out opportunities to learn, grow, and 
share her expanded knowledge with others. 
She has also led by example in her philan-
thropic efforts, devoting significant time and 
energy to spearheading CBO’s efforts each 
year to raise money for breast cancer re-
search. She has helped raise thousands of 
dollars for that cause over the years. She will 
be missed by her colleagues, who have bene-
fited greatly from the depth of her knowledge, 
as well as her generous spirit, warmth, and 
collegiality. 
I know my colleagues will join me in extend-
ing our thanks and appreciation for Simone’s 
service to our country. We wish her a relaxing, 
well-deserved retirement.

RECOGNIZING MARCH FOR LIFE 
2022 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 21, 2022 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, today, I rec-
ognize the thousands of faithful and devoted 
students from central and west-central Illinois 
and around the country who are participating 
in this year’s March for Life celebrations. The 
March for Life began in Washington, DC, as a 
small demonstration and has since become 
the largest pro-life event in the world. 
I am proud to represent Catholic schools in 
my district, like Peoria Notre Dame High 
School, Quincy Notre Dame High School, 
Routt Catholic High School in Jacksonville, 
Sacred Heart-Griffin High School in Spring-
field, and Bloomington Central Catholic, as 
they continue to show unending and unwaver-
ing support for the pro-life movement. I am 
honored to recognize the efforts of pro-life ad-
vocates across the 18th District who have

worked tirelessly to protect unborn infants and 
provide necessary support and resources to 
pregnant mothers. 
On this 49th anniversary of the Roe v. 
Wade ruling, we must continue to pursue a 
national culture that promotes and protects life 
for all individuals. The right to life is a human 
right, and it is critical that our current and fu-
ture generations work towards a pro-life future. 
Students, such as the ones that I represent in 
the 18th District, continue to play an integral 
role in fighting for the lives of the most vulner-
able. 
As we aspire for a world where every life is 
celebrated and protected, I want to commend 
the support for pro-life values in my district 
and the annual support of March for Life cele-
brations across the country.

CONGRATULATING JOE EVANS 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 21, 2022 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to a man who has served the na-
tion in various capacities for more than 41 
years and is now retiring from his position as 
Chief Administrative Officer of the Congres-
sional Budget Office. Joseph Evans began his 
service with 41⁄2 years in the U.S. Air Force, 
where he was a financial management spe-
cialist. He then joined the Defense Intelligence 
Agency (DIA), where he took on steadily in-
creasing responsibilities during his 19-year 
tenure—first as an accounting technician, and 
then as Human Intelligence Financial Re-
source Manager, Chief of Budget Formulation 
Integration and Funds Control, Senior Finance 
Resource Manager, and ultimately as Senior 
Financial Resources Expert. In that capacity, 
he provided expert advice and guidance on all 
budgetary, financial, and force structure man-
agement to the DIA’s Chief Financial Execu-
tive and directed the planning and coordi-
nating of the DIA budget. For his important 
contributions to DIA’s work, he received the 
DIA Award for Meritorious Civilian Service. 
Mr. Evans then put his financial skills to 
work in the legislative branch, joining CBO as 
its Chief Financial Officer and then taking on 
broader responsibilities as its Chief Adminis-
trative Officer and Director of Management, 
Business, and Information Services. Over his 
18 years at CBO, Mr. Evans provided superb 
leadership, pushing for continuous improve-
ment, developing high-functioning teams of 
professionals, maintaining focus on the needs 
of the client, and treating all employees with 
respect and kindness. 
He has skillfully overseen the areas of 
human resources, finance, editorial and publi-
cation services, security, and information tech-
nology—the largely behind-the-scenes activi-
ties that enable CBO to perform its vital serv-
ices for the Congress. Under his leadership, 
CBO has received a continuous series of 
clean opinions on its financial statements. 
CBO’s measures to protect privacy and secu-
rity have never been stronger. Mr. Evans also 
played a crucial role leading CBO’s working 
group on diversity and inclusion. During the 
pandemic, CBO continued to meet the needs 
of the Congress while protecting CBO employ-
ees, thanks in large part to the incredible work 
of Mr. Evans and his team. They provided the 
technology and support needed to transition 
seamlessly from working in the office to a full- 
time telework environment and developed new 
ways of performing important tasks, such as 
hiring new staff, overseeing security efforts, 
and supporting employees’ well-being and 
safety. 
I thank Joe for his more than four decades 
of dedicated and skillful work for the American 
people and wish him well in his retirement.

RECOGNIZING MARGARET 
JACKSON 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 21, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life of Margaret ‘‘Pookie’’ Jack-
son as we mourn her passing and recognize 
her contributions to her community in Michi-
gan’s 13th District Strong. 
Ms. Jackson was born and raised in Detroit, 
spending the early part of her childhood in the 
heart of the historic Black Bottom community 
on Detroit’s East Side. The Jackson house-
hold was centered around family and their 
faith, values that remained in Ms. Jackson her 
whole life. 
Ms. Jackson led a quiet life, focused on 
raising her children in a supportive and loving 
home. As a single parent, she worked long 
hours throughout her nearly fifty-year career at 
Detroit Medical Center, but always saw that 
their needs were met and nurtured. Ms. Jack-
son shared her passion for the arts and cul-
ture with her children, taking them to many 
festivals and art exhibits throughout Detroit. 
She encouraged her children to pursue higher 
education, to never stop learning, and to make 
smart decisions about their personal finances. 
Outside of her family life, Ms. Jackson was 
a faithful member of Scott Memorial United 
Methodist Church, where she enjoyed Adult 
Sunday School and participating in the United 
Methodist Women’s Ministry. Her entire life, 
she was surrounded by love. She will be 
missed by her family, friends, and community. 
Please join me in recognizing the life of 
Margaret Jackson, as we, her friends, and 
family give honor to her memory. 
CONGRATULATING CYNTHIA R. 
CLEVELAND 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 21, 2022 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and recognize the outstanding service 
of Cynthia R. Cleveland on her retirement 
after nearly 43 years of distinguished public 
service, the past 39 years of which were spent 
at the Congressional Budget Office. At CBO, 
Cindy rose to the level of Division Administra-
tive Assistant, mostly for the Director of the 
National Security Division. 
Cindy’s public service began at the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office in 1976, where 
she spent three years as a clerk typist. Over 
the ensuing four decades at CBO, Cindy’s ex-
pert skills grew as the tools and processes for 
producing 
cost 
estimates 
and 
reports 
evolved—from typewriters to Sharepoint, and 
from landline calls to virtual meetings. All 
along, Cindy provided rock solid support and 
a positive and friendly spirit, one that was con-
tagious to those around her. 
Her responsibilities also evolved and grew 
over the years, moving from supporting the 
chief of the Natural Resources Unit in the 
Budget Analysis Division, where she helped 
produce cost estimates for publication, to the 
assistant to the director of the National Secu-
rity Division, where she kept the division run-
ning and also managed the division’s docu-
ment holdings and its clearance processes. 
Along the way, Cindy’s portfolio expanded to 
include supporting the Macroeconomic Anal-
ysis Division and eventually the Financial 
Analysis Division. She helped organize and 
support the semiannual meetings of CBO’s 
Panel of Economic Advisors, organized travel 
and training for all three divisions, and man-
aged the background investigation and clear-
ance process for all of CBO. Throughout her 
career at CBO, Cindy embodied the agency’s 
ethos of doing things carefully and with high 
quality. 
Cindy’s colleagues, current and former, are 
deeply indebted to her for all that she has 
given to CBO and the people that make the 
agency what it is. Cindy knew everyone and 
everyone knew her. They will miss her gentle, 
friendly, and positive influence on the work-
place and, most of all, will miss her laughter 
ringing down the halls of the Ford building. 
I know my colleagues join me in extending 
our thanks and appreciation to Cindy for her 
long service to our country. We wish her well 
in her future undertakings.
