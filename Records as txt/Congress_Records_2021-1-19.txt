Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 2021 
No. 10 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 1 p.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Gracious God, we thank You for the 
heroes 
You 
have 
set 
before 
us, 
exemplars like Martin Luther King, 
Jr., whose voice sounds a clarion call 
that resonates still today. 
May his prayers be ours and his 
dream our own: that we would live ac-
cording to Your design that no one 
would be judged by the color of their 
skin, or their side of the aisle, but by 
the content of their character. 
Leave us not devoid of the power to 
forgive but embolden us with the power 
to love, that we would be willing to 
risk our position, our prestige, and 
even our lives for the welfare of our 
neighbors and the good of this country. 
Then one day may this Nation be ca-
pable to present itself to be measured 
not by where we have stood in mo-
ments of comfort and convenience but 
in times of challenge and controversy. 
We pray these things, asking for the 
intelligence to know Your will, the 
courage to do Your will, and the devo-
tion to love Your will. 
In the strength of Your holy name. 
Amen.

waves of grain with the righteousness 
that exults nations. Heal this land of 
curvaceous mountains by removing 
from it sins that bring reproach to any

Without

U.S. SENATE, 
January 18, 2021. 
Governor GAVIN NEWSOM, 
Sacramento, CA. 
DEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOM: I hereby resign 
as Senator from the State of California, ef-
fective January 18, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. EST. As 
I assume my duties as Vice President of the 
United States, I would like to thank the peo-
ple of California for the honor of serving 
them in the U.S. Senate over the past four 
years. 
Sincerely, 
KAMALA D. HARRIS, 
U.S. Senator. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized. 
f 
MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
understand that the Senate has re-
ceived a message from the House of 
Representatives that it has taken ac-
tion relative to impeachment, though 
it has not yet transmitted the article 
of impeachment to us. 
I ask that pursuant to rule I of the 
Rules of Impeachment, the Secretary 
of the Senate notify the House that the 
Senate has received its message. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). So ordered. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous 
consent to speak for 1 minute in morn-
ing business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IOWA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last 
week, I started my annual tradition of 
holding Q&A’s with Iowans in all 99 
counties. This is my 41st consecutive 
year, and remember that only one 
meeting counts for the tally. But I hold 
many Q&A’s in more populous coun-
ties. 
For example, I was in 10 counties last 
week: A snow plow manufacturer in 
Manchester, IA, that employs over 300 
Iowans and the Marshalltown High 
School to hear what is on the minds of 
young people, because they never come 
to my town meetings. I heard about 
the pandemic, the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, commodity prices, infra-
structure, and high drug prices. 
I look forward to the next 89 county 
meetings to keep in touch with my 
constituents. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
last time the Senate convened we had 
just reclaimed the Capitol from violent 
criminals who tried to stop Congress 
from doing our duty. 
The mob was fed lies. They were pro-
voked by the President and other pow-
erful people, and they tried to use fear 
and violence to stop a specific pro-
ceeding of the first branch of the Fed-
eral Government which they did not 
like. 
But we pressed on. We stood together 
and said an angry mob would not get 
veto power over the rule of law in our 
Nation, not even for one night. 
We certified the people’s choice for 
their 46th President. 
Tomorrow, President-Elect Biden and 
Vice President-Elect HARRIS
will be 
sworn in. We will have a safe and suc-
cessful inaugural right here on the 
west front of the Capitol—the space 
that President Bush 41 called ‘‘democ-
racy’s front porch.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S50 
January 19, 2021 
And then we will move forward. Our 
work for the American people will con-
tinue, as it has for more than 230 years. 
There are serious challenges that our 
Nation needs to continue confronting, 
but there will also be great and hopeful 
opportunities for us to seize. 
Certainly, November’s elections did 
not hand any side a mandate for sweep-
ing 
ideological 
change. 
Americans 
elected a closely divided Senate, a 
closely divided House, and a Presi-
dential candidate who said he would 
represent everyone. 
So our marching orders from the 
American people are clear. We are to 
have a robust discussion and seek com-
mon ground. We are to pursue bipar-
tisan agreement everywhere we can 
and check and balance one another re-
spectfully where we must. And through 
all of this, we must always keep in 
mind that we are all Americans, we all 
love this country, and we are all in this 
together. 
f 
HONORING POLICE OFFICERS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a related matter, a great deal 
has already been said about the dis-
graceful events of January 6. More will 
be said in the weeks ahead. 
I understand the FBI has already 
made at least 100 arrests, and the Jus-
tice Department reports more than 275 
persons under investigation—a number 
that is climbing fast. I want to com-
mend the work of the Department to 
swiftly investigate and bring offenders 
to justice. 
As I have stated, January 6 saw fail-
ures of institutions, protocols, and 
planning. Those failures did not just 
leave Congress itself exposed; they also 
left the courageous men and women of 
the Capitol Police themselves in a to-
tally untenable situation. 
So today, I want to reaffirm the huge 
respect and gratitude that I have—and 
I believe all Senators have—for the 
men and women of the U.S. Capitol Po-
lice who put their own safety on the 
line every single day that they clock in 
and stand guard. 
Neither the institution of Congress 
nor the American people will ever for-
get the bravery and the valor of Officer 
Brian Sicknick, who sacrificed himself 
to protect this place and those inside 
it. 
We will not forget our friend Officer 
Howard Liebengood. 
And we will never forget our debt to 
all the brave CP officers and their fam-
ilies. 
It is more than just comforting to 
come to work in a place protected by 
such fine men and women, at risk to 
themselves. It is also very humbling. 
We are also grateful to the local offi-
cers from DC, Virginia, and Maryland, 
to Federal law enforcement officers, 
the National Guard, the Secret Service, 
and all the other professionals who 
helped subdue the criminals and secure 
the Capitol on the 6th and are working 
together to protect peace and order 
this week. 
Tomorrow, a new President and Vice 
President will swear their oaths of of-
fice. They will also do so safely and se-
curely because so many brave men and 
women have sworn their own oaths to 
support and defend our Constitution. 
We salute you all. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 13 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, I understand there is a bill at the 
desk due a second reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the bill by title for the 
second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 13) to establish an advisory com-
mittee to make recommendations on im-
provements to the security, integrity, and 
administration of Federal elections. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I object to further 
proceeding. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before 
I get into my remarks, I noted that my 
dear friend and colleague, the Senator 
from Illinois, is giving remarks to say 
a fond and, I am sure, a somewhat 
poignant farewell to Reema Dodin, who 
has done a great job for him, for the 
Senate, for Senate Democrats, and for 
me for decades. We are going to miss 
her very much. The only consolation is 
that she is going on to the new admin-
istration and even bigger and better 
things. 
f 
59TH INAUGURATION CEREMONIES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Senate returns to session today for 
what will be a very busy and con-
sequential period. Tomorrow, we will 
celebrate one of democracy’s core at-
tributes: 
the 
peaceful 
transfer 
of 
power, albeit under much different cir-
cumstances than most Americans are 
used to. 
Rioters, insurrectionists, White su-
premacists, and domestic terrorists 
tried to prevent the transfer of power. 
They were incited by none other than 
the President of the United States. 
They have failed. Though they have 
made the transition of power anything 
but peaceful, democracy’s oldest and 
most revered tradition, the peaceful 
passing of the torch, will take place to-
morrow. 
We must remain vigilant. We must 
remain strong. If we do, democracy will 
always prevail. Despite what these evil 
terrorists tried to do, the peaceful 
passing of the torch will take place to-
morrow as it has for generations. 
In the weeks since the attack, the 
Nation has learned about the heroism 
displayed by many Capitol Police offi-
cers on January 6. I want to again 
thank those officers who protected 
Members and staff. Let us also recog-
nize the bravery of one officer in par-
ticular, Brian Sicknick, who was killed 
in the line of duty. 
I also want to acknowledge those 
members of the fourth estate for their 
efforts during these difficult times, for 
continuing to shine a light on what is 
happening at the Capitol, sometimes at 
great personal risk. 
Now, in the wake of the despicable 
assault on the U.S. Capitol on January 
6, we have taken precautions to ensure 
the safety of the Inauguration of Presi-
dent-Elect Biden tomorrow. Senate 
leadership has been in close and con-
stant communication with the Secret 
Service, the FBI, the National Guard, 
and the D.C. police. As we speak, there 
are more troops around the Capitol 
than there are in Afghanistan. No 
force—no force—will prevent tomor-
row’s constitutional proceedings from 
taking place. 
Tomorrow, Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS will be administered the oath 
of office. They will be sworn into the 
Presidency and Vice Presidency of the 
United States, and the powers vested in 
our Chief Executive will flow to a new 
office holder, a peaceful passing of the 
torch, as it has been for over two cen-
turies in the grand tradition of democ-
racy in the United States of America. 
Tomorrow, the country will turn the 
page on the most chaotic and divisive 
Presidency that can ever be remem-
bered. We will begin again the hard 
work of unifying and healing this Na-
tion, defeating the pandemic, recov-
ering our economy, and repairing our 
standing and stature in the world—and 
this is just the beginning. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Inauguration of a new President and 
the start of a new administration al-
ways brings a flurry of activity to our 
Nation’s 
government, 
but 
rarely— 
rarely—has so much piled up for the 
Senate as during this particular transi-
tion. Over the next several weeks, the 
Senate must accomplish three essen-
tial items: a second impeachment trial 
of Donald Trump; the confirmation of 
President Biden’s Cabinet and other 
key officials; and legislation to provide 
much 
needed—almost 
desperately 
needed—COVID relief. 
Again, 
there 
are 
three 
essential 
items of business. No. 1, as mandated

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S51 
January 19, 2021 
by law and Constitution, once the 
House of Representatives delivers Arti-
cles of Impeachment to the Senate, we 
will conduct and complete a trial of 
Donald Trump for inciting an insurrec-
tion against these United States. 
No. 2, the Senate will confirm key 
members 
of 
soon-to-be 
President 
Biden’s Cabinet. Those Cabinet offi-
cials in charge of national security 
must be confirmed quickly, as well as 
those in charge of responding to the 
current health and economic crisis. 
No. 3, the Senate will take up legisla-
tion to provide the country additional 
relief from the pandemic. 
On impeachment, the Senate has sol-
emn responsibility to try and hold 
Donald Trump accountable for the 
most serious charge ever levied against 
a President: the incitement of an insur-
rection against the United States of 
America. 
The events on January 6, make no 
mistake about it, were not a sponta-
neous demonstration. President Trump 
invented the lie that motivated these 
criminals. He exhorted them to come 
to Washington. He then directed them 
at the U.S. Capitol, and his dema-
goguery whipped them into a frenzy. 
We need to set a precedent that the 
severest threat ever committed by a 
President will be met by the severest 
remedy provided by the U.S. Constitu-
tion: impeachment and conviction by 
this Chamber, as well as disbarment 
from future office. 
In 230 years, the House of Represent-
atives has impeached the President of 
the United States only twice. In just 
the past 13 months, it has impeached 
President Trump twice more. President 
Trump is a threat to our constitutional 
order whether he is in or out of office. 
Even now, he has not accepted respon-
sibility for what he has done and still 
falsely maintains that the election was 
stolen. 
Once he leaves office, do we really ex-
pect him to change his tune and accept 
the truth? Of course not. He will con-
tinue spreading lies about the election 
and stoking the grievances of his most 
radical supporters, using the prospect 
of a future Presidential run to poison 
the public arena at a time when we 
must get so much done. After what he 
has done, the consequences of which we 
were all witness to, Donald Trump 
should not be eligible to run for office 
ever again. 
All of us want to put this awful chap-
ter in our Nation’s history behind us, 
but healing and unity will only come if 
there is truth and accountability, not 
sweeping such a severe charge, such 
awful actions, under the rug. 
So let me be clear. There will be an 
impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate. 
There will be a vote on convicting the 
President of high crimes and mis-
demeanors. And, if the President is 
convicted, there will be a vote on bar-
ring him from running again. 
Now, the Cabinet. As I mentioned, 
the Senate must also fulfill its con-
stitutional duty to advise and consent 
on soon-to-be President Biden’s execu-
tive and judicial nominations, particu-
larly his Cabinet. Today, there are no 
fewer than five Senate hearings on 
Cabinet-level officials for good reason. 
The violent insurrection at the U.S. 
Capitol on January 6 showed us we 
need qualified Senate-confirmed people 
in key national security positions on 
day one. That means tomorrow. 
The Senate will be in session tomor-
row after the conclusion of the Inau-
guration of the 46th President of the 
United States. With cooperation, we 
can confirm key national security 
nominees at State, the Department of 
Defense, Homeland Security, Treasury, 
and the intelligence community. The 
health and economic challenges our 
Nation faces and the need to get vac-
cines out quickly also require having 
key health officials and key economic 
nominees confirmed and on the job as 
soon as possible. 
In 2017, the Senate confirmed Presi-
dent Trump’s Secretary of Defense and 
his Secretary of Homeland Security on 
Inauguration 
Day. 
President 
Biden 
should have the same officials in place 
on his Inauguration Day at the very 
least. That is the expectation and tra-
dition for any administration, but es-
pecially now in the midst of a Home-
land Security crisis. 
As I said, the way the Senate works, 
it will take cooperation from our Re-
publican colleagues to swiftly confirm 
these highly qualified national secu-
rity officials. But make no mistake, 
the Senate will move quickly to con-
sider and confirm President Biden’s 
cabinet. 
Finally, on COVID and the legisla-
tion that is needed, once the Senate 
has confirmed key nominations for the 
incoming administration, it will turn 
to the subject of additional COVID re-
lief items, including key items such as 
an increase in direct payments to 
American families; strong, further sup-
port of vaccine distribution which 
must be improved; help for small busi-
nesses, schools, and State and local 
governments. Very soon, the country 
will pass another tragic milestone: 
400,000 American deaths from COVID– 
19. There is no issue more urgent then 
defeating this pandemic, and the Sen-
ate will immediately set to work on 
that goal as the first order of legisla-
tive business. 
There will be much more work for us 
to do in the following months. Working 
with President Biden and our House 
colleagues, the Senate will finally ad-
dress the major challenges facing our 
country that have for too long been ig-
nored. We will consider bold legislation 
to defeat the climate crisis by invest-
ing in clean infrastructure and manu-
facturing, which will create millions of 
good jobs for Americans, regardless of 
ZIP Code. We must move significantly 
to 
improve 
our 
healthcare 
and 
childcare systems. To fix and restore 
our income and equality problem, we 
will fight to restore workers’ rights 
and fairness in the Tax Code. 
Today, we announce the first bill, S. 
1, which will be a package of long over-
due reforms to protect our democracy 
after it has been so attacked in 4 years 
and will guarantee every American’s 
right to vote. 
One issue that has been long impor-
tant to me is immigration reform. I al-
ways felt that comprehensive immigra-
tion reform with a path to citizenship 
is one of the most important things a 
Democratic Congress can do. To me, 
passing comprehensive reform is a very 
high priority, so I was pleased that 
President-Elect Biden has crafted a 
proposal and will call on Congress to 
take up this important subject. I am 
studying 
the 
President-elect’s 
pro-
posal, and I look forward to working 
together with him and the new admin-
istration and with my colleagues in 
Congress to get comprehensive immi-
gration reform signed into law. 
As I said at the beginning of this 
talk, the next several months will be 
very, very busy and a very consequen-
tial period for the U.S. Senate. Let us 
begin our work in earnest. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
f 
FAREWELL TO THE SENATE 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, it 
has been the honor of my lifetime to 
serve Georgia in the U.S. Senate. There 
has never been a day that I don’t walk 
through the hallways of the Capitol 
when I am not awestruck by the mag-
nitude of this job and of this place and 
of my duty. 
I want to thank my colleagues, espe-
cially those who welcomed me from the 
start, who worked with me, and who 
even across the aisle worked with me 
to get things done for our country in 
such a consequential year. 
I want to thank the people of Georgia 
who showed me the very best of our 
great State. My goal as Senator was 
clear: to work every single day to 
make Georgians’ lives better and to 
make ours the very best State to work, 
to live, to worship, and to raise a fam-
ily. 
I never stopped working to meet that 
goal and was energized and humbled 
every single day by the opportunity to 
serve. In between weeks spent in Wash-
ington, I crisscrossed our great State 
nonstop, going from southeast coastal 
Georgia in Camden County to north-
west mountain Georgia in Catoosa 
County. Time with Georgians are my 
fondest memories. 
One of my earliest visits was in 
Homerville, GA, population 2,400. I car-
ried the people of Homerville with me 
every day as I approached my work. 
Having grown up on our family farm, 
where the nearest small town had a 
population of 600, my calling to public 
service was, in large part, to be a 
voice—an outsized voice—for those who 
feel they didn’t have a voice in Wash-
ington. 
Many Georgians inspired me each 
day to bring results to every corner of

our State. In that spirit, I want to 
thank Governor Kemp for appointing 
me and entrusting me with the impor-
tant work of being a voice for our 
State and a servant to our citizens. 
I was proud to serve alongside my 
friend and colleague Senator David 
Perdue. 
I want to recognize Senator Johnny 
Isakson and Senator Saxby Chambliss 
for their shining example of what it 
meant to be a Senator, and, most im-
portantly, a public servant. I also want 
to recognize and thank my incredible 
husband, Jeff, whose love and support 
encouraged me every single day. And I 
want to thank my family for instilling 
the values of faith, family, and hard 
work. You all have my deepest love and 
gratitude. 
As importantly, I want to recognize 
my very talented and hard-working 
staff, many of whom are with me 
today. Together, our work here and in 
Georgia has made a tremendous dif-
ference in our State. 
Let me tell you about just some of 
that work, because in one significant 
year in the Senate, I am so proud of all 
we have accomplished together. We de-
livered more than $47 billion in relief 
to Georgia during the pandemic—to 
farmers, to family, to small businesses, 
hospitals, and schools. And, as a fresh-
man Senator, I introduced and passed 
six pieces of legislation. We secured 
funding for rural hospitals. We in-
creased telehealth access, and we sped 
the delivery of PPE to the frontlines. 
I championed and we passed legisla-
tion that increased funding to help 
homeless veterans get back on their 
feet, and I was proud to champion agri-
culture, our State’s leading industry, 
as well as our military, law enforce-
ment, small businesses, and school 
choice. 
I stood up for innocent life, the Sec-
ond Amendment, and all of our con-
stitutional rights. 
I was able to use my business experi-
ence to develop four wide-ranging plans 
to drive economic security, keep our 
Nation safe, modernize our healthcare 
system, and increase opportunities in 
minority communities. 
In 2020 alone, our office helped over 
5,200 Georgians with casework, includ-
ing nearly 1,000 Georgia veterans and 
Active-Duty service men and women 
navigate their VA benefits in VA med-
ical centers. 
I am incredibly proud of all the work 
we accomplished together for our State 
and for our country. There is much 
more work to do. I had hoped to pass a 
piece of my legislation to bring back to 
the United States from China the man-
ufacturing of our critical medical sup-
plies, 
including 
prescription 
drugs, 
over-the-counter medicine, and med-
ical equipment. 
I want to wish my successor well in 
his work serving Georgia. 
Now, most farewell speeches urge col-
leagues to put country before party or 
to fix what is broken here in the Sen-
ate. My message is slightly different. 
In all of the events of recent weeks, I 
want to urge my colleagues to remem-
ber why we are here, whom you serve, 
and to recall the greatness of the 
American experiment, as well as the 
fragile nature of our freedoms. 
I spent 30 years in the private sector 
chasing the American dream. I worked 
on our family’s farm. I waitressed. I 
lived paycheck to paycheck. I moved 
around the country and worked hard to 
overcome setbacks and to build a re-
spected career in business. I came to 
Georgia two decades ago as a job seek-
er, and I became a job creator, helping 
to grow a small startup company into 
a Fortune 500 company. 
And, like many Georgians, part of 
that work is giving back in our com-
munities and supporting others in 
achieving their dreams. I have done 
that now in business, in philanthropy, 
in sports, and now in public service. 
That is the American dream. It gives 
everyone, regardless of their back-
ground, the freedom to make the most 
of their life, chase their passions, build 
their family and their career, and 
thrive in the greatest country in the 
world. Protecting that dream for all 
Americans should be our common 
cause, regardless of political party. 
As I served over the last year, it has 
become clear that we need more out-
siders, 
more 
business 
people, 
and 
fewer—with all due respect—fewer poli-
ticians. 
Americans have high expectations for 
us. They are looking for leadership. 
They want results, and, right now, they 
want their lives back. They are looking 
for us to restore America and protect 
their dreams, not to take advantage of 
a crisis and expand the government. 
They certainly don’t want their way 
of life overwhelmed by radical change 
and costly policies that will push them 
out of their job, limit their children’s 
educational opportunities, and threat-
en their right to worship and speak 
freely. 
At the same time, while those on the 
left feign a desire for unity, they say 
they cannot tolerate it without ac-
countability. In essence, there can be 
no unity without conforming to their 
views. Disagree, and you will be can-
celed, and not just your social media 
account but your job, your family, 
your educational opportunities, and 
even your God-given rights. Only those 
who meet the ideological purity test 
can claim moral superiority and main-
tain their voice. 
Over the last year, I experienced this 
firsthand many times. Yes, I have been 
a proud champion of conservative val-
ues, but I always put Georgia first 
ahead of politics. As the pandemic 
began to unfold, I worked around the 
clock to deliver relief across Georgia, 
yet the mainstream media, including 
my own hometown newspaper, flooded 
its pages not with serious coverage of 
my relief efforts but with completely 
false stories about stock trades fab-
ricated by a leftwing blog. 
When this political attack was thor-
oughly debunked, that fact was largely 
omitted from subsequent coverage to 
fit their narrative. The truth is, the 
mainstream media and Big Tech in-
creasingly care only about advancing 
their political ideology and protecting 
only the speech that fits into their spe-
cific narrative. The double standards, 
disdain, and contempt that elites and 
institutions of influence have for con-
servatives is increasingly being re-
vealed. For the sake of our discourse, 
this cannot continue. 
As a starting point, we must hold ac-
countable those who limit our free 
speech and the loss of our civil dis-
course in this country. The American 
people are alarmed by the effort to cen-
sor conservative voices. We are wit-
nessing a constitutional crisis that 
threatens to erode the First Amend-
ment and silence people across our 
country. As a Republican and a con-
servative American who still believes 
in the Constitution and the core prin-
ciples on which our country was found-
ed, I refuse to be intimidated by the 
cancel culture and its dangerous nar-
ratives. 
However, not every American feels 
free to speak up. Their voices are being 
lost. 
This is why this Senate is so impor-
tant. For 230 years, the U.S. Senate has 
been the central venue for voicing dis-
senting views, and it has celebrated the 
deliberation of issues confronting our 
Nation. 
You must be the voice for those who 
can’t use theirs. Now is the time. The 
urgency weighs on our country. If we 
are serious about uniting, it must be 
out of respect for diversity, not despite 
it. Diversity of belief is not monolithic. 
In 1964, a future President Ronald 
Reagan spoke to his fellow Americans 
saying: 
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. 
We will preserve for our children this, the 
last best hope of man on earth, or we will 
sentence them to take the first step into a 
thousand years of darkness. 
These sage words echo today. These 
words are timeless. 
To my colleagues in the Senate, I 
urge you to address the dire threats to 
our First Amendment rights in order 
to restore every American’s faith in 
our democracy and to help restore our 
trust in each other. It is the only way 
to ensure that America, the world’s 
shining city on the hill, a republic ad-
mired for centuries, can endure for fu-
ture generations. 
I encourage each of you to uphold our 
uniquely American values and preserve 
the American dream, and I will con-
tinue to champion our party’s values 
from 
whatever 
position 
I 
occupy. 
America depends on it. Americans are 
counting on us to be their voice. 
For a shy farm girl who was the first 
in her family to graduate from college, 
who could never have imagined that 
one day I would serve as the U.S. Sen-
ator from the great State of Georgia, 
thank you all. It has been my deepest 
honor. 
May God bless you, and may God 
bless the United States of America.

January 19, 2021 
I yield the floor. 
(Applause.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I 
make my prepared remarks, I would 
like to note the fact that this is the 
first time that I am returning to the 
floor of the Senate since the events of 
January 6. It was in the early morning 
hours of January 7 that we concluded 
our business and left this Chamber to 
return to our homes for the interim pe-
riod. 
We left, knowing that something ter-
rible had happened in this building on 
January 6, but we didn’t know the ex-
tent of it. As Members of the Senate, 
we were largely protected from this 
terrorist 
insurrection, 
which 
took 
place in this building. 
It was about 2:15 p.m. on that after-
noon of January 6, when Vice President 
PENCE was presiding over the Senate 
and most of us were in our seats, that 
there was a commotion at the Chair 
and the Secret Service came in and lit-
erally pulled the Vice President away 
from that podium and took him out the 
door. We weren’t sure what was hap-
pening. It all unfolded quickly. There 
was an effort to make a quorum call to 
determine which Senators were on the 
floor. It was interrupted when a rep-
resentative of the Capitol Police stood 
where the Presiding Officer is now 
seated and instructed us to stay in this 
room, in this Chamber, in the Senate, 
in our chairs. The staff people and sur-
rounding offices were going to line the 
walls. This was going to be a safe place 
of refuge for whatever was going on. 
I remember that moment particu-
larly 
because 
something 
happened, 
which is etched in my memory. Two 
plain clothes officers came down into 
the well of the Senate and stood there, 
just a few feet from where I am stand-
ing. One of them had an automatic 
weapon around his neck. I couldn’t 
imagine what was going on, where, in 
the U.S. Senate Chamber, it was nec-
essary to have that kind of firepower. 
He stayed there for a few minutes, 
and then we were told to leave and 
leave quickly. We filed out the doors 
and down the steps and walked across 
through the tunnel to the Hart build-
ing, where Members of the Senate were 
safely protected. 
That is one of the reasons I wanted to 
say a word this afternoon and this 
morning. The Capitol Police, through-
out this, were heroic. They were over-
whelmed by this massive insurrec-
tionist mob. The Capitol Police, as well 
as the others who joined them—the DC 
Metropolitan Police and other law en-
forcement agencies, which I don’t know 
the names of as I stand here—I want to 
thank them all for literally risking 
their lives for me, for Members of the 
Senate, for our staff, and visitors. 
It wasn’t until the next day that we 
learned—that many of us learned—that 
a Capitol policeman had been killed— 
killed by this mob. My heart goes out 
to him and his family. I thank him and 
all of his colleagues, men and women, 
who each day get up in the morning, 
put on their uniforms, and come to this 
building to protect me and protect the 
other Members of the Senate and the 
House and all of the staff who work 
here. We will never be able to repay 
them in any words for what they sac-
rificed and risked on January 6, but let 
us never, never demean what happened 
that day. It was a terrorist attack— 
homegrown American terrorist attack. 
I know we are going to spend some 
time discussing who provoked that at-
tack. The Republican majority leader 
laid the blame, as he should have, at 
the feet of the President, who invited 
this group to Washington and then 
urged them to come march on Capitol 
Hill. I know we will go into this matter 
with more detail at a later point. 
But the fact of the matter is, we en-
dured a great travesty and a great vio-
lation of our Republic on that day. To 
think that in this building—this build-
ing that we value so much—so many 
people came in hell-bent on death and 
kidnapping and destroying this great 
Chamber and the building around it. It 
is inconceivable that this happened in 
America, and we have to come to grips 
with it in honest, truthful terms and 
not say: Oh, that was yesterday’s news-
paper, and we have to move on. 
But there is good news—good news in 
light of the bad news that I have just 
recounted. The good news is that by 
this time tomorrow, we will have a new 
President and a new Vice President of 
the United States. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO REEMA DODIN 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we 
begin the Congress and prepare to wel-
come President Biden and Vice Presi-
dent Harris, I find myself thinking of 
the words of the 13th century Persian 
poet, Rumi. He wrote, ‘‘Out beyond the 
ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, 
there is a field. I’ll meet you there.’’ 
For the moment that we are living 
through, I would edit his words slight-
ly. I would say: Out beyond the ideas of 
right versus left, out beyond the rigid 
confines of our current polarized poli-
tics, there is a field of common good 
and common purpose. I hope we will all 
find the courage to meet there, to work 
together in this place. 
At another moment of dangerous di-
vision in America, Abraham Lincoln 
prayed that the ‘‘better angels of our 
nature’’ would help us to rediscover 
our common bond and pull back from 
the brink of a civil war. 
Today, the Union, preserved through 
that war, is battered and divided. For 
the first time since the Civil War, 
thousands of Federal troops stand 
guard at our Nation’s Capitol to pro-
tect it from attack by American citi-
zens. 
Carpenters and other crafts people 
are still hard at work repairing the 
doors 
and 
windows 
and 
furniture 
smashed to bits less than 2 weeks ago 
by the insurrectionist mob. We must be 
better than this or we risk losing our 
democracy. 
I believe that beyond the killing field 
of weaponized politics, there is still a 
field of shared dreams, which brings me 
to a specific reason I take the floor of 
the Senate today. 
I come to thank a remarkable woman 
who has devoted countless hours over 
many years trying to help the Members 
of this Senate, Democrats and Repub-
licans, find that field on which we can 
work together. 
Reema Dodin has been a member of 
my staff for more than 14 years. She 
started as a law school intern in my 
Chicago office, and over the years, she 
rose through the ranks: legislative as-
sistant; research director; Judiciary 
Committee staff member; floor coun-
sel; and finally my deputy chief of 
staff. 
For years, my person on the Senate 
floor has been this woman, this amaz-
ing woman. I am grateful for her serv-
ice to the Senate and her service to the 
people of Illinois and to our Nation. 
But tomorrow Reema begins a new 
challenge as Deputy Director of the 
White House Office of Legislative Af-
fairs. This daughter of immigrants will 
make history as the highest ranking 
Palestinian-American woman ever to 
work in the executive branch of the 
President of the United States. 
As the liaison to the U.S. Senate, she 
will continue to help the Senate search 
for common ground on which to build a 
better future; only now she will be 
doing it from a different office, with a 
much better boss. 
I know that she will be a tremendous 
asset to President Biden and the Na-
tion. In these divided times, it is rare 
to find a public servant like Reema, 
whose excellence and integrity is so 
widely admired on both sides of the 
aisle. 
No 
one 
understands 
better 
than 
Reema—well, perhaps two people in the 
Chamber might understand better— 
how this Senate works but only two. 
As the saying goes, she wrote the book 
on it, coauthoring an insightful tome 
entitled ‘‘Inside Congress: A Guide for 
Navigating the Politics of the House 
and Senate Floors,’’ published in 2017 
by the Brookings Institution. It came 
this close to being a New York Times 
bestseller. But maybe still, with this 
speech today, it will reinvigorate sales. 
As floor director for the Senate 
Democrats, Reema has worked closely 
with staff and Members on both sides 
of the aisle to whip bills and overcome 
hurdles. No matter how long or pitched 
the debate, she has always remained 
friendly, decent, optimistic, and dedi-
cated. It was not unusual to find her 
still at her desk at midnight or 2 in the 
morning, sending her final whip alert 
or email of the day to Senate staffers 
summarizing the day’s activities and 
the next day’s Senate agenda. 
Reema acquired her political and dip-
lomatic acumen through hard work

and partly, it seems, through genetics. 
Her grandfather served as Social Af-
fairs Minister for the Kingdom of Jor-
dan under King Hussein and was in-
volved in the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
negotiations in the 1970s. 
As I mentioned, Reema, like so many 
Americans, including myself, is a child 
of immigrants. Her parents both came 
to the United States as college stu-
dents from Hebron, in the occupied 
West Bank. 
Reema was born in North Carolina 
and grew up in Orange County, CA. She 
graduated from the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley, earned her law de-
gree from the University of Illinois 
Champaign-Urbana, and we made her 
an honorary daughter of the land of 
Lincoln. She also is a Truman National 
Security fellow; a New Leaders Council 
fellow; an Aspen Socrates alumnus; a 
former term-member of the Council on 
Foreign Relations; and a member of 
the Jenkins Hill Society, a consortium 
of women in politics supporting women 
politicians. 
Reema loves the Senate, and she 
loves the challenge of this great Cham-
ber. She loves to give tours in this 
Chamber to those who want to know 
the procedure and the history of this 
beautiful room in American history 
and the Capitol of our Nation. She 
cares about the people who protect and 
preserve this building, including the 
maintenance people, cafeteria workers, 
and everyone who works here. 
Even after so many years of climbing 
the marble staircase from the Senate 
floor to my office, she and I remain in 
awe of those time-worn steps, the 
colorful Minton tiles that brighten the 
Senate 
floors, 
and 
the 
majestic 
Brumidi frescos that adorn the walls. 
During the recent siege of the Cap-
itol, Reema worried for the safety of 
Senators and their staff, police offi-
cers, and troops who were defending 
this building, but she also worried 
about the priceless paintings, statues, 
and other historical treasures that had 
been passed down from one generation 
to the next as part of our national leg-
acy. 
Most of all, I know that Reema re-
veres the Senate as the place where 
men and women representing all of the 
people and all of the competing inter-
ests of the United States can reason 
and work together for the common 
good of our Nation. 
In her personal inscription to her 
book on the Senate, Reema thanked 
me for taking a chance on folks with 
only dreams and no connections. 
Well, Reema, tomorrow when you 
join the staff of the President of the 
United States, Joe Biden, you will have 
the best connections in Washington, 
and I know that you will use whatever 
opportunity presents itself on this new 
assignment to bridge the gaps in Amer-
ica and bring together the people of 
this country in a better, more caring 
nation. 
I will forever be grateful for your 
many years of brilliant, loyal service, 
and I wish you the best. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WICKER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
HONORING OFFICER BRIAN 
SICKNICK 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, in the 
Christian faith, there is a saying: 
‘‘Greater love hath no man than this, 
that a man lay down his life for his 
friends.’’ I rise today to talk about 
that kind of sacrifice, that kind of 
love, and ultimately that tragedy in 
the death of a man who is a hero. 
Officer Brian David Sicknick was 
many things. He was a loving son to his 
parents, Gladys and Charles Sicknick; 
a loving brother to Ken and Craig 
Sicknick; and a loving partner of 11 
years to Sandra Garza. He loved his 
two dachshunds, Sparky and Pebbles, 
and he took great care of them. 
Many of us got to know Officer 
Sicknick because he served in the Cap-
itol Police Department. He was some-
one who loved his job and understood 
that every day when you put on that 
uniform, when you come to the Capitol 
of the greatest power on the planet, the 
United States of America, that wearing 
that uniform, wearing that badge, you 
had a sacred duty to protect this sa-
cred space. 
I am proud to say that Officer 
Sicknick was a Jersey guy through and 
through. He was born in New Bruns-
wick, NJ, raised in South River, and he 
lived a life committed to the greatest 
calling you can have, which is to serve 
others, to protect others, to defend not 
just your Nation but her citizens. He 
was a member of the New Jersey Air 
National Guard. He loved his country. 
And I am proud to say he loved Jersey 
too. He was a New Jersey Devils fan. 
He proudly, in his work and commit-
ment, served his country in the 108th 
Security Forces Squadron in Saudi 
Arabia and Kyrgyzstan. 
Officer Sicknick was a reliable and 
cherished colleague. If you talk to 
those who knew him, they knew that 
he was a man of honor and decency and 
kindness. They knew he loved this job. 
He loved being a Capitol Police officer. 
He loved serving this Nation. He loved 
helping people. He loved his work. 
That love is evident in so many sto-
ries shared by his family and friends, 
people who, in this time of painful 
grief, are still celebrating the life he 
lived even though it was cut short by 
hate. People speak to his character and 
the qualities, the values that made him 
so special. He was kind. He was pa-
tient. Like many of those who rise in 
their service to this country, he was 
humble. And he was selfless. 
You talk to people who knew him 
really well, and they remember him as 
the kind of officer who would go out of 
his way, not just in his service to those 
of us who frequent the Capitol but to 
make sure that his colleagues, his fel-
low Capitol Police officers, were also 
doing OK. He was not just a leader; he 
was a servant. And they remember him 
living with that sense of honor and 
that sense of duty. They remember him 
as the kind of person who would stand 
courageously in the face of a colleague, 
who would sacrifice for them, who be-
lieved that service meant commitment, 
meant bringing your grit and your guts 
and your love. And that is what he did. 
On January 6, 2021, when a violent 
mob attacked this Capitol, Officer 
Sicknick stood for America. He stood 
for this Capitol and all of its inhab-
itants. He was steadfast. He was coura-
geous. He stood in the breach to pro-
tect the lives of the Members of this 
body, their staffs, personnel. He faced 
down terrorist attackers and sacrificed 
himself, his own safety, his own secu-
rity, and ultimately his life in the 
name of love of country and of the 
countrymen and—women. 
Officer Sicknick is the very defini-
tion of a hero, and he deserves to be re-
membered for the richness of his life, 
the way that he loved, and the devo-
tion that he gave this Nation. That he 
is no longer with us today is a grievous 
tragedy, and it is also a crime. This 
great man was murdered. This crime 
demands the full attention of Federal 
law enforcement officials. Anyone who 
still harbors doubt about what hap-
pened here on January 6 should think 
of him. 
On January 6, when extremists, when 
terrorists, when White supremacists 
attacked our Nation’s Capitol, they 
took the life of one of our officers. 
They spilled his blood. They took a son 
away from his parents. They took a 
sibling away from his brothers. They 
committed this treachery while waving 
flags, 
claiming 
solidarity—some 
of 
them—with law enforcement, but it 
was hate—it was hate; it was hate— 
that brought terror to our Capitol and 
the death of one of our sons. 
So many of the words that led up to 
that day, the lies that were told, the 
incitement and the encouragement, 
came from the highest office of our 
land to dotted members of authority 
across our country—these collective 
actions that led to the moment, the 
terrorists who are directly responsible 
as well. 
In the aftermath, a hero, a Capitol 
Police officer, is dead— a champion, a 
hero. This is a senseless tragedy, an 
awful crime. I am not alone when I say 
to Officer Sicknick’s family and loved 
ones that we—that I vow to hold those 
responsible for this heinous crime ac-
countable. 
We must honor Officer Sicknick’s 
heroism and sacrifice not just with our 
words but by what we do here in the 
coming days, what we do as a nation, 
how we all take responsibility in the 
aftermath of a horrific moment.

January 19, 2021 
Officer Sicknick died for this coun-
try. He did not die in vain. We, the liv-
ing, must—must—continue with his 
level of courage as we tell the truth, as 
we hold others responsible and for ac-
count, as we try to live in the spirit 
that he lived: with humility, honor, 
courage, kindness, love, decency. 
May Officer Brian Sicknick always 
be remembered for his service to the 
country he loved, and may we rise to 
his example and honor him. All those 
who have fallen in defense of this Na-
tion, may we honor them in how we 
live for this country.

f 
HONORING SECURITY DETAIL AND 
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
as the most senior Republican Senator 
in the Republican majority, I have had 
the privilege to serve as Senate Presi-
dent pro tempore in the 116th Congress. 
The last time a Senator from Iowa 
served in this constitutional office was 
100 years ago. For the last 2 years, it 
has been my great honor each day to 
open the business of the Senate, wel-
come Chaplain Barry C. Black to lead 
us in opening prayer and recite the 
Pledge of Allegiance with my col-
leagues and staff. It was a distinct 
honor to enroll bills with my signature 
before they left Capitol Hill for the 
President’s desk to be signed into law. 
Today, I pay tribute to a group of 
selfless professionals who was assigned 
to serve as my security detail. As this 
body knows, the President pro tempore 
serves in the Presidential line of suc-
cession and receives 24-hour protection. 
Now, as most Americans might imag-
ine, it took some time to get accus-
tomed to having a security detail fol-
lowing my every step, around the 
clock, 365 days a year. These dedicated 
professionals made the transition as 
seamless as possible. They served with 
integrity, 
discretion, 
and 
profes-
sionalism. Some of them might not 
have known the journey in store when 
they embarked 2 years ago on this as-
signment. By journey, I refer of course 
to my heavy travel schedule. For start-
ers, I return nearly every weekend to 
Iowa and whenever the Senate is not in 
session. And lest anyone imagine there 
is a nonstop commercial flight between 
the Nation’s Capital and my farm in 
Butler County, I will disabuse anyone 
of that fairy tale. 
Agents on my security detail became 
frequent fliers and intimately familiar 
with the map of Iowa. My work sched-
ule includes my annual 99 county meet-
ings across the State. Last year, I fin-
ished my 40th consecutive year holding 
meetings with Iowans in courthouses, 
schools, factory floors, hospitals, and 
service clubs. Typically, Iowa weather 
adds a bit of uncertainty to the sched-
ule. Last year, the pandemic opened a 
whole new can of worms. I want to 
thank my security detail for doing an 
exceptional job these past 2 years. I 
can confirm none of the agents in-
dulges in a treat from Dairy Queen as 
much as I do. 
My security detail also learned on 
day one of their assignment that I am 
an early bird. I like to wake up early 
and get my morning jog in before the 
sun crests the horizon. They learned 
every step of my route in northern Vir-
ginia and the country gravel roads in 
Butler County, IA. The agents showed 
an exemplary work ethic and respect 
for punctuality which, as my staff and 
many Iowans who attend my meetings 
know, is very important to me. I don’t 
like to waste time or money, especially 
on the taxpayer dime. 
Today, I salute the following mem-
bers of the U.S. Capitol Police Dig-
nitary 
Protection 
Division: 
Super-
visory Agent David Rib, Agent Eric 
Boggs, Agent Shane Powell, Agent 
John Brito, Agent Eric Love, Agent 
Zachary Madera, Agent Daniel Mur-
phy, Agent Arnold Pierre, Agent Luis 
Pimentel, Agent Ryan Rayball, Agent 
Zachary Samson, Agent John Whittle, 
Agent Joseph Larue, Agent Justin God-
frey, Agent Michael Bell, Agent Caleb 
Horton, 
Agent 
Muhammed 
Khan, 
Agent Tobey Murray, Agent Robert 
Schultz, Agent Travis Scott, Agent 
Richard Dahl, Agent Brandon Exum, 
Agent Carlos Fonseca, Agent Louis 
Mannella, Agent Brooke Littlewood, 
Agent 
Nicholas 
Koffarnus, 
Agent 
Wayland Massengill, Agent Jesse Cole, 
Agent 
Todd 
Sindelar, 
Agent 
Cory 
Flere, Agent Gabriel Santos-Muniz, 
and Agent Nicholas Wirth. 
Barbara and I enjoyed teaching some 
of the agents about agriculture at the 
Iowa State Fair. Together, we rooted 
for UNI Panthers wrestling, basketball, 
and volleyball on many occasions. 
Many of them became fond of Iowa. 
They discovered the meaning of ‘‘Iowa 
Nice.’’ Iowa will welcome you back 
anytime for a visit. 
Barbara and I have enjoyed getting 
to know you and for giving the full 
measure of devotion to your job to 
keep me safe and sound. The Capitol 
riots on January 6 revealed how seri-
ously you take your oaths of office and 
I sincerely thank you for putting your-
selves in harm’s way on my behalf. We 
wish you and your families all the best 
in the years ahead. 
Speaking about the violent attacks 
that took place in the U.S. Capitol, on 
the 6th of January, I also extend my 
appreciation to the legion of Capitol 
Police officers who protect this sacred 
civic space. They put their lives on the 
line every day to put the safety of oth-
ers before their own. They keep watch 
over 535 members of Congress, the 
thousands of staffers who serve the 
American people here in the legislative 
branch, and the millions of people and 
youth groups who come every year to 
visit the U.S. Capitol. The riots serve 
as a stark reminder never to take law 
enforcement for granted. We mourn the 
loss of two Capitol Police officers—Of-
ficer Brian D. Sicknick and Officer 
Howard Liebengood—who lost their 
lives this month. Barbara and I con-
tinue to pray for them and the loved 
ones they leave behind.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AN/AAQ–24(V)N LAIRCM system is 
a self-contained, directed-energy counter-
measures system designed to protect aircraft 
from infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles. 
The LAIRCM system features digital tech-
nology 
micro-miniature 
solid-state 
elec-
tronics. The system operates in all condi-
tions, detecting incoming missiles and jam-
ming infrared-seeker equipped missiles with 
aimed bursts of laser energy. The LAIRCM 
system consists of the Guardian Laser 
Transmitter 
Assembly 
(GLTA), 
LAIRCM 
System 
Processor 
Replacement 
(LSPR), 
multiple Missile Warning Sensors, the Con-
trol Interface Unit Replacement (CIUR), and 
the Classified Memory Card User Data Mod-
ule. The AN/PYQ–10 Simple Key Loader is 
also a necessary device. 
2. The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assem-
bly (GLTA) is a laser transmitter pointer/ 
tracker subsystem designed to track the in-
bound threat missile and point the laser jam 
source at the missile’s seeker. The GLTA 
automatically deploys the countermeasure. 
3. The LAIRCM System Processor Replace-
ment (LSPR) analyzes the data from each 
Missile Warning Senor and automatically de-
ploys the appropriate countermeasure via 
the GLTA. The LSPR contains Built-in-Test 
(BIT) circuitry. 
4. The AN/PYQ–10 Simple Key Loader is a 
portable, hand-held device used for securely 
receiving, storing, and transferring data be-
tween compatible cryptographic and commu-
nications equipment. 
5. The missile Warning Sensors detect and 
declare threat missiles. The sensors are 
mounted on the aircraft exterior to provide 
omni-directional protection. The sensors de-
tect the rocket plume of missiles and send 
appropriate data signals to the LSPR for 
processing. 
6. The Control Interface Unit Replacement 
(CIUR) displays the incoming threat for the 
pilot to take appropriate action. The CIUR 
also provides operator interface to program 
the LAIRCM system to initiate built-in-test 
(BIT), to display system status, and to pro-
vide the crew with bearing to threat missile 
launch. 
7. The Classified Memory Card User Data 
Module contains the laser jam codes. The 
Classified Memory Card User Data Module is 
loaded into the LSPR prior to flight; when 
not in use, the Classified Memory Card User 
Data Module is removed from the LSPR and 
put in secure storage. 
8. The highest level of classification of in-
formation included in this potential sale is

The proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a Major Non-NATO Ally that is an important 
force for political stability and economic 
progress in the Middle East. 
The proposed sale of the AH–64E Apache 
helicopters will supplement and improve Ku-
wait’s capability to meet current and future 
threats by enhancing Kuwait’s close air sup-
port, armed reconnaissance, and antitank 
warfare mission capabilities. Kuwait will 
have no difficulty absorbing these heli-
copters into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors associated with 
this sale will be The Boeing Company, Mesa, 
AZ; Lockheed Martin Corporation, Orlando, 
FL; General Electric, Cincinnati, OH; Lock-
heed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors, 
Owego, NY; Longbow Limited Liability Cor-
poration, Orlando, FL; and Raytheon Cor-
poration, Tucson, AZ. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the temporary assignment of ap-
proximately three U.S. Government per-
sonnel and five contractor representatives to 
Kuwait to support delivery of the helicopters 
and provide support and equipment famil-
iarization. In addition, Kuwait has expressed 
an interest in a Technical Assistance Field-
ing Team (TAFT) to provide in-country pilot 
and maintenance training. Execution of a 
TAFT will require a team of twelve addi-
tional personnel (one military and eleven 
contractors) to be deployed to Kuwait for the 
period of approximately three years. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AH–64E Apache Attack Helicopter is 
the 
Army’s 
advanced 
attack 
helicopter 
equipped for performing close air support, 
anti-armor, and armed reconnaissance mis-
sions. The aircraft contains the following 
sensitive communications and target identi-
fication equipment, navigation equipment, 
aircraft survivability equipment, displays, 
and sensors: 
a. The AN/ARC–201 Very High Frequenqy- 
Frequency 
Modulation 
(VHF–FM) 
Single 
Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System 
(SINCGARS) airborne radio is a reliable 
field-proven voice and data communication 
system used with the AH–64E. A country- 
unique non-COMSEC export variant of this 
radio will be provided that meets Kuwait’s 
requirements. 
b. The AN/ARC–231 Ultra High Frequency 
(UHF) radio is a software defined radio for 
military aircraft that provides two-way 
multi-mode voice and data communications 
over a 30hz to 512hz frequency range. The 
MFX 4027 is a variant system based on the 
AN/ARC–231 architecture but incorporating 
commercial encryption. The radio offered to 
Kuwait will be determined based on U.S. and 
Kuwaiti requirements. 
c. The Identify Friend-or-Foe (IFF) digital 
transponder set provides pertinent platform 
information in response to an IF interro-
gator. The digital transponder provides coop-
erative Mark XII IFF capability using full 
diversity selection, as well as Mode Select 
(Mode S) capability. In addition, transponder 
operation provides interface capability with 
the aircraft’s Traffic Collision and Avoid-
ance System (TCAS). The transponder re-
ceives pulsed radio frequency interrogation 
signals in any of six modes (1, 2, 3/A, S, and 
5), decodes the signals, and transmits a 
pulse-coded reply. The Mark XII IFF oper-
ation includes Selective Identification Fea-
ture (SIF) Modes 1, 2, 3/A and C, as well as se-
cure cryptographic Mode 5 operational capa-
bility. 
d. Link 16 Datalink is a military tactical 
data link network. Link 16 provides aircrews 
with enhanced situational awareness and the 
ability to exchange target information to 
Command and Control (C2) assets via Tac-
tical 
Digital 
Information 
Link-Joint 
(TADIL–J). Link 16 can provide a range of 
combat information in near-real time to U.S. 
and allies combat aircraft and C2 centers. 
The AH–64E uses the Harris Small Tactical 
Terminal (SIT)) KOR–24A to provide Air-
borne and Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF) 
Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) ca-
pability. The SIT is the latest generation of 
small, two-channel, Link 16 and VHF/UHF 
radio terminals. While in flight, the SIT pro-
vides simultaneous communication, voice or 
data, on two key waveforms. 
e. The AN/APR–39 Radar Warning Receiver 
Signal Detecting Set is a system that pro-
vides warning of a radar directed air defense 
threat 
and 
allows 
appropriate 
counter-
measures. This is the 1553 databus compat-
ible configuration. 
f. The AN/AVR–2B Leaser Warning Set is a 
passive laser warning system that receives, 
processes and displays threat information re-
sulting from aircraft illumination by lasers 
on the aircraft’s multi-functional display. 
g. The AAR–57 Common Missile Warning 
System (CMWS) detects energy emitted by 
threat missile in-flight, evaluates potential 
false alarm emitters in the environment, de-
clares validity of threat and selects appro-
priate counter-measures for defeat. The 
CMWS consists of an Electronic Control Unit 
(EUC), 
Electro-Optic 
Missile 
Sensors 
(EOMSs), and Sequencer and Improved Coun-
termeasures Dispenser (ICMD). 
h. The ICMD Countermeasures Dispensing 
M211 Flare is a countermeasure decoy in a 
1″x1″x8″ for factor in an aluminum case car-
tridge. It consists of case, piston, special ma-
terial payload foils, and end cap. The special 
material is a pyrophoric metal (iron) foil 
that reacts with oxygen to generate infrared 
energy. The M211 decoys are dispersed from 
an aircraft to be used as a decoy in combina-
tion with the currently fielded M206 and 
M212 
countermeasure 
flares 
to 
protect 
against advanced air-to-air and surface-to- 
air missile threats. 
i. Embedded Global Postponing System 
(GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)(EGI) 
with Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) uses GPS 
satellite signals to correct or calibrate a so-
lution for precise positioning from an Iner-
tial Navigation System (INS). The aircraft 
has two EGIs with MMR which use internal 
accelerometers, rate gyro measurements, 
and external sensor measurements to esti-
mate the aircraft state, provides aircraft 
flight and position data to aircraft systems. 
The EGI is a velocity-aided, strap down, ring 
laser gyro based inertial unit. The EGI unit 
houses a GPS receiver. The receiver is capa-
ble of operating in either non-encrypted or 
encrypted. When keyed, the GPS receiver 
will automatically use anti-spoof/jam capa-
bilities when they are in use. The EGI will 
retain the key through power on/off/on cy-
cles. Because of safeguards built into the 
EGI, it is not considered classified when 
keyed. Integrated within the EGI is an Iner-
tial Measurement Unit (IMU) for processing 
functions. Each EGI also houses a Multi- 
Mode Receiver (MMR). The MMR is incor-
porated to provide for reception of ground 
based NA VAID signals for instrument aided 
flight. Provides IMC IIFR integration and 
certification of improved Embedded Global 
Positioning System and Inertial (EGI) unit, 
with attached MMR, with specific cockpit 
instrumentation allows Apaches to operate 
within the worldwide IFR route structure. 
Also includes integration of the Common 
Army Aviation Map (CAAM). Area Naviga-
tion (RNA V), Digital Aeronautical Flight 
Information File (DAFIF) and Global Air 
Traffic Management (GATM) compliance.

provides day, night, limited adverse weather 
target information, as well as night naviga-
tion capabilities. The PNVS provides ther-
mal imaging that permits nap-of-the-earth 
flight to, from, and within the battle area, 
while TADS provides the co-pilot gunner 
with search, detection, recognition, and des-
ignation by means of Direct View Optics 
(DVO), television, and Forward Looking In-
frared (FLIR) sighting systems that may be 
used singularly or in combinations. 
k. The AN/APR–48B Modernized Radar Fre-
quency Interferometer (M–RFI) is an updated 
version of the passive radar detection and di-
rection finding system. It utilizes a detach-
able UDM on the M–RFI processor, which 
contains the Radar Frequency (RF) threat li-
brary. 
l. The AN/APG–78 Longbow Fire Control 
Radar (FCR) with Radar Electronics Unit 
(REU) is an active, low-probability of inter-
cept, millimeter wave radar. The active 
radar is combined with a passive Radar Fre-
quency Interferometer (RFI) mounted on top 
of the helicopter mast. The FCR Ground Tar-
geting Mode detects, locates, classifies and 
prioritizes stationary or moving armored ve-
hicles, tanks and mobile air defense systems 
as well as hovering helicopters, helicopters, 
and fixed wing aircraft in normal flight. If 
desired, the radar data can be used to refer 
targets to the regular electro-optical Mod-
ernized Target Acquisition and Designation 
Sight (MTADS). 
m. The Manned-Unmanned Teaming Inter-
national (MUM–Ti) data link system pro-
vides 
cross-platform 
communication 
and 
teaming between Apache, unmanned aerial 
systems (UAS), and other interoperable air-
craft and ground platforms. It provides the 
ability to display real-time UAS sensor in-
formation and MTADs full motion video 
feeds across MUM-T equipped platforms and 
ground stations. The MUM–Ti is the multi- 
band export version of the datalink for the 
AH–64E. 
n. The M299 Missile Launcher, commonly 
known as the Longbow Hellfire Launcher 
(LBHL), is a four rail launcher designed to 
carry the complete family of AGM–114 
Hellfire missiles. 
o. The M261 2.75 Inch Rocket Launcher is a 
nineteen tube, three zone rocket launcher 
utilized on heavy attack aircraft. 
p. The Longbow Crew Trainer (LCT) is a 
containerized, 
deployable, 
high-fidelity 
flight simulator used to train Apache crew 
members. The LCT provided will be config-
ured to reflect Kuwait’s AH–64E Operational 
Flight Program software. 
2. The highest level of information that 
may be transferred in support of this pro-
posed sale is classified SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures which might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that Ku-
wait can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection of this technology as the 
U.S. Government. This proposed sale is nec-
essary in furtherance of U.S. foreign policy 
and national security objectives outlined in 
the Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles, technical data, and 
services listed in this transmittal are au-
thorized for release and export to the Gov-
ernment of Kuwait.

quested to buy three thousand (3,000) GBU–39 
SDB I munitions. Also included are con-
tainers; weapon support and support equip-
ment; spare and repair parts; U.S. Govern-

The proposed sale will improve Saudi Ara-
bia’s capability to meet current and future 
threats by increasing its stocks of long- 
range, precision air-to-ground munitions. 
The size and accuracy of the SDB I allows for 
an effective munition with less collateral

glide weapon able to strike fixed and sta-
tionary re-locatable targets from standoff 
range. The SDB I weapon system consists of 
the weapons, the BRU–6l/A (4-place pneu-
matic carriage system), shipping and han-
dling containers for a single weapon and the 
BRU–61/A either empty or loaded, and weap-
on planning module. It has integrated dia-
mond-back type wings that deploy after re-
lease, which increases the glide time and 
therefore maximum range. The SDB I Anti- 
Jam Global Positioning System aided Iner-
tial Navigation System (AJGPS/INS) pro-
vides guidance to the coordinates of a sta-
tionary target. The payload/warhead is a 
very effective multipurpose penetrating and 
blast fragmentation warhead couples with a 
cockpit selectable-electronic fuze. Its size 
and accuracy allow for a effective munition 
with less collateral damage. A proximity 
sensor provides height of burst capability.

HONORING COUNCILMEMBER 
WENDY SKILLMAN 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Cotati City 
Councilmember Wendy Skillman on the occa-
sion of her retirement after more than eight 
years of dedicated service to our community. 
Councilmember Skillman’s record as a pub-
lic servant traces back to 2008, when she first 
moved to Cotati. As a member of the city’s 
Community and Environment Commission, 
she organized beloved events including the 
annual Christmas tree lighting and the ever- 
popular Pasta Feed and Bingo Night. After 
more than three years as the Commission’s 
Secretary and later Vice Chair, she assumed 
the role of Cotati Planning Commissioner, 
where she developed strategies in cooperation 
with local businesses and homeowners to 
grow the city’s economy while protecting its 
small-town charm. Those she worked with ap-
preciated her ability to find common ground 
and advance solutions that served everyone’s 
interests. 
Following her initial foray into city politics, 
Councilmember Skillman ran a successful 
campaign for City Council in 2012. Focusing 
on affordable housing and championing local 
small businesses, she generated wide-spread 
community support that carried her to a re-
sounding reelection victory four years later. 
Throughout her terms, she has prioritized co-
operation and compromise, leading to many 
successes. Under her watch, the city emerged 
from its financial troubles, not only keeping 
public services operational, but expanding the 
Police Department, adding new Public Works 
employees, and kick-starting recreation pro-
grams. Well respected by her fellow Council 
Members, she served with distinction as the 
Vice Mayor of Cotati in 2014 and 2019 and as 
Mayor in 2015 and 2020. Her leadership, dedi-
cation, and tenacity will surely be missed by 
her colleagues and constituents. 
Madam Speaker, Councilmember Wendy 
Skillman exemplifies the very best qualities 
that our community looks to in a leader. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today.

LONG-TIME 
PUBLIC 
SERVANTS IN PIMA COUNTY, AR-

HON. ANN KIRKPATRICK 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021 
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
before you today to recognize four important 
community leaders in Tucson and Southern 
Arizona. These public servants have now 
completed their service to Pima County, Ari-
zona, and they deserve high distinction. They 
include Mr. Ramon Valadez, Pima County Su-
pervisor; F. Ann Rodriguez, Pima County Re-
corder; Bill Staples, Pima County Assessor; 
and Barbara LaWall, Pima County Attorney. 
Each of these distinguished Arizonans has 
dedicated many years of their lives and their 
careers to serve our people. They provided 
security, integrity, dedication, and the highest 
leadership. Madam Speaker, I ask you to join 
me in celebrating the public service of these 
exemplary individuals, to wish them good luck 
in their future endeavors, and to join me in 
recommending that young leaders seeking ca-
reers in public service look to them as models 
of what it means to live a good life in the serv-
ice of things larger than oneself.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF CAPTAIN PERCY OWENS NOR-
WOOD JR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
service of a remarkable individual, retired Cap-
tain Percy Owens Norwood Jr. 
Retired U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Percy 
Owens Norwood Jr. was born February 14, 
1946, in Memphis to Percy and Charlie Lott 
Norwood. Capt. Norwood of Carrollton, 74, 
was called to his heavenly home on Friday, 
November 27, 2020, at Tyler Holmes Memo-
rial Hospital in Winona. 
As a young man, Capt. Norwood enlisted in 
the United States Coast Guard on November 
20, 1970. After almost 30 years of outstanding 
and dedicated service to our nation, he retired 
with the rank of captain on October 1, 2000. 
At the time of his retirement, he held three key 
positions: Commanding officer of Coast Guard 
Headquarters 
Support 
Command, 
com-
manding officer of Coast Guard Headquarters 
staff, and executive officer of Coast Guard 
Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Percy re-
ceived numerous personal awards that include 
the Legion of Merit, two Meritorious Service 
Medals, two Coast Guard Commendation 
Medals, and the Coast Guard Achievement 
Medal. His nonmilitary awards include the Na-
tional Image Incorporated Award (1993), the 
National Naval Officers Association’s (NNOA) 
Dorie Miller Award (1993), the National Asso-
ciation for Equal Opportunity in Higher Edu-
cation (NAFEO) Distinguished Alumni Award 
(1995), and the NAACP Roy Wilkins Renown 
Service Award (1995). Mr. Norwood was in-
ducted into the Alcorn State University Hall of 
Honor in 2006 for his outstanding leadership 
and service and elected by his fellow Alumni 
as Alcornite of the Year in 2008 as Alcorn 
State University most distinguished alumnus. 
Capt. Norwood leaves to cherish his mem-
ory his wife, Bessie Marie Norwood; his chil-
dren, Angelia Lavette Collins, Kelvin King 
Shaifer, Lindsey Marie Norwood Carson (Na-
thaniel) and Matthew Reginald Norwood; his 
grandchildren Devon, Shy, Nathaniel III, Alexis 
and Camerin; his great-grandchildren, Alex, 
Emberly and Zaniyah; his siblings Laura Nor-
wood Davis, Willie Norwood, James Norwood 
(Rosie) and Ruther Flowers; his sister-in-law, 
Verna Norwood; his god-sister, Willie Mae 
Smith; his aunt, Emma Harrison; and a host of 
nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life, legacy and service of 
Captain Percy Owens Norwood Jr.

CALLING FOR THE ABOLITION OF 
THE FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to condemn the use of capital punish-
ment in the United States and to call for its 
abolition. 
Capital punishment is an unjust and inhu-
mane practice. It is past time we join devel-
oped democracies throughout the world and 
abolish this barbaric practice. 
The death penalty in the United States is 
deeply unfair and inequitable. It is a sentence 
disproportionately given to people of color, in-
dividuals with mental illness and the economi-
cally disadvantaged. Black people make up 
less than 13 percent of the nation’s population 
while accounting for more than 42 percent of 
those on death row. And despite the Supreme 
Court ruling that intellectual disability lessens 
moral culpability, an estimated five to ten per-
cent of all death row inmates suffer from a se-
vere mental illness. The death penalty is also 
overwhelmingly imposed on poor people, with 
95 percent of death row defendants from un-
derprivileged backgrounds. 
The methods of execution used in the 
United States are unquestionably inhumane. 
States still allow people to be put to death by 
hanging, firing squad, electrocution and gas 
chamber. Although the recent adoption of le-
thal injection is purportedly more humane, re-
cent botched executions have resulted in ago-
nizing and prolonged deaths for individuals— 
undeniably a cruel and unusual punishment. 
As long as the death penalty exists, inno-
cent individuals will be convicted and sen-
tenced to death. Since 1973, 172 former

death-row prisoners have been exonerated of 
all charges related to the wrongful convictions 
that had put them on death row. We cannot 
continue to employ a system of punishment 
that has such a high risk of taking innocent 
life. 
The United States stands out among our al-
lies and other democracies in its use of the 
death penalty. Many of our allies consider it a 
gross violation of human rights. Defending 
human rights abuses abroad has been a key 
pillar of U.S. foreign policy, but the continued 
use of the death penalty at home undermines 
our global standing and enables other coun-
tries to criticize other diplomatic efforts. 
Under the Trump Administration’s Depart-
ment of Justice, executions of federal death- 
row prisoners have recently resumed for the 
first time since 2003. In the midst of our cur-
rent public health crisis, the Department of 
Justice has executed more people in six 
months than the total number executed over 
the previous six decades. 
Most Americans know that the death penalty 
does not represent justice in our country. It is 
cruel, inhumane, arbitrary and clearly discrimi-
natory. It is time for us to finally abolish the 
death penalty.

CONDEMNING THE JANUARY 6TH 
ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
outrage and sadness at the insurrection and 
attempted coup we saw in this very building 
on January 6. There is no doubt this attack 
was instigated by President Trump and re-
sponsibility for the violence rests with him and 
his supporters who ransacked the People’s 
House. 
I’d like to include in the RECORD the fol-
lowing statement from my constituents, the 
Youngstown Warren Black Caucus write: 
The Youngstown Warren Black Caucus is 
outraged by the act of domestic terrorists at 
our nations’ Capitol Building yesterday. Al-
though we are angry and saddened, we agree 
with our 44th President Barack Obama’s 
statement that it was not a total surprise. 
Donald Trump and many Republican mem-
bers of Congress who attempted to disenfran-
chise the votes of 81 million citizens have 
been encouraging insurrection by their vot-
ers. Even after multiple recounts, legal de-
feats, and explanation of the constitution 
and how elections are run, Trump continued 
to spout lies about the election that he lost. 
He and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani 
have been telling their supporters for 2 
months that the election was fraudulent and 
that there was a chance they could change 
the outcome if people just complained, pro-
tested, and demanded they won knowing full 
well the outcome could not be changed. 
While the majority of the nation understood 
that was untrue, their most loyal supporters 
believed them. For his final act of defiance 
to democracy, Trump invited thousands of 
supporters to DC yesterday for a rally and 
march to the Capitol building to ‘‘stop the 
steal’’ before Congress would certify the 
Electoral College votes that have already 
been certified by every state in the nation. 
Sadly, they listened to the instructions of 
these liars and our nations’ Capitol building 
was breached for the first time since the War 
of 1812. 
Besides the obvious need to punish anyone 
who broke the law, we believe those who in-
cited this insurrection must be held account-
able for the betrayal to our nation. That in-
cludes Trump and members of Congress who 
attempted to throw out the results of the 
presidential election and Insurrection is a 
criminal act which is why we join the 
NAACP, Urban League, and National Action 
Network in calling for the resignation or re-
moval of Donald Trump. He is anything but 
a patriot. 
Last, but certainly not least, our members 
are appalled by the continued disparate 
treatment 
by 
law 
enforcement 
between 
white and black Americans. Back in June of 
2020 a peaceful protest by Black Lives Matter 
demonstrators outside the White House was 
charged by numerous law enforcement enti-
ties to clear a block so that Trump could 
walk across the street and hold a Bible up-
side down outside a neighborhood church. 
Conversely, the angry mob of thousands of 
rioters were met with little resistance. Some 
Capitol police held the doors open for the ri-
oters, others took pictures with them as 
they headed towards Congressional Cham-
bers and offices to vandalize, steal, and de-
stroy federal property. 
The event made it painfully clear that 
there are 2 justice systems in America. One 
for black and brown people and their white 
allies, and a separate one for domestic ter-
rorists who embrace white supremacy. It is 
ridiculous that we are still having this con-
versation 245 years after the founding of this 
nation. America must live up to her promise 
of ‘‘and justice for all.’’ 
I thank the Capitol Police and other law en-
forcement personnel for their work to protect 
Members and all who work in the Capitol 
Complex. However, it is obvious that there 
were systematic breakdowns in security that 
need to be addressed. We must get to the 
bottom of these breakdowns and prevent them 
from ever happening again.

HONORING KRISTINE SVINICKI 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pride and enthusiasm that I take a few 
moments to recognize the tremendous career 
of public service of Ms. Kristine Svinicki, who 
recently announced that she will step down 
later this month as Chair of the Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission. 
As the Representative of Idaho’s Second 
Congressional District and Chair and Ranking 
Member of the House Energy and Water Ap-
propriations subcommittee, I have spent my 
career advocating for the expanded use of 
safe and reliable nuclear energy. In that effort, 
I had the distinct pleasure to work closely with 
Kristine in a number of capacities, and like ev-
eryone else who has worked with her, I found 
her to be a consummate professional and 
dedicated public servant. 
After graduating from the University of 
Michigan with a degree in nuclear engineering, 
Kristine’s career led her to the Department of 
Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy and the Of-
fice of Civilian Radioactive Waste Manage-
ment. Her time with DOE also included a stop 
at the Department’s Idaho Operation Office in 
Idaho Falls. Kristine was later detailed by the 
DOE to the U.S,Senate where she supported 
Idaho Senator Latty Craig on a variety of en-
ergy issues. After a stint with the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, in 2007 President 
George W. Bush nominated Kristine to serve 
as a Commissioner on the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission and in 2017, President Donald J. 
Trump designated her as Chairman. 
During her three terms at the NRC, Kristine 
brought unparalleled knowledge, passion and 
leadership to her work. Kristine never came to 
a meeting unprepared, and I always left hear-
ings and meetings with her impressed by her 
insights and persuasiveness. 
As the nuclear industry has faced chal-
lenges, the federal government has worked to 
support the current fleet of reactors as appro-
priate, to modernize the regulatory process to 
allow advanced reactor technologies to enter 
the market and to right-size the staff at the 
NRC. In all of those issues, Commissioner 
and Chairman Svinicki brought a steady hand 
and a constructive ‘‘let’s get to work’’ attitude 
to the process. 
Chairman Svinicki’s commitment to public 
service has been exceptional and she is a role 
model for those who want to serve our gov-
ernment and make an impact in a positive 
way. Kristine blazed her own trail, and she will 
leave behind scores of friends, colleagues and 
coworkers who will miss her intellect, her com-
mitment to public service and her wry sense of 
humor. 
While Kristine was born and raised in Michi-
gan, we in Idaho like to claim her as one of 
our own. I am so proud of all Kristine has ac-
complished, and more importantly how she did 
it. On behalf of so many grateful Americans, I 
want to say thank you to Kristine for her serv-
ice and extend my best wishes in the future.

OPPOSITION TO H. RES. 21 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in opposition to H. Res. 21 and its invocation 
for Vice President MIKE PENCE to activate Sec-
tion 4 of the 25th Amendment. 
The Resolution appears to be ill-conceived, 
vindictive and disassociated from any factual 
basis. There is no medical, scientific or other 
evidence that the President is operating under 
an infirmity that prevents the faithful execution 
of our laws. Indeed, no one even so much as 
asked for such evidence. No independent 
medical exam was sought. No interviews of 
cabinet members or testimony was proffered 
where one or more cabinet members could 
have presumably attested to some medical or 
physical infirmity warranting immediate inter-
vention. 
While it is true the President has his detrac-
tors, almost all of whom support this ill-ad-
vised resolution, attacking one’s political oppo-
nents by invoking the most dramatic and 
emergency based provisions in the Constitu-
tion is reckless and poses serious harm to the 
Republic. Unfortunately, as it has been 
brought to the floor, the political bar has been 
lowered. I voted no as there is no merit to it 
and it is plainly a vengeful attack at the out-
going President who has been vilified by leftist

media and others. I remain concerned that this 
provision will be brought up against the next 
president, and the next, and the next, for mere 
political opportunism. 
Indeed, in light of the incoming president’s 
age and existing infirmities, I fear a movement 
to remove him without just cause using this 
provision. I am told that Mr. Biden won the 
presidency in the greatest popular vote on 
record in the history of the United States. To 
me that means the American people knew 
what they were voting on, embraced him as 
their choice, and that choice should not be 
easily disturbed, if ever. More concisely, the 
American people were well aware of Mr. 
Biden’s age and health issues and that cannot 
be used as a pretext to remove him before the 
natural expiration of his term. This historic vic-
tory, greater than the then-historic victory of 
Obama, cannot be tarnished by congressional 
machinations to remove the next president. I 
will not countenance such villainy, nor will the 
Republic. 
Invocation of the 25th Amendment should 
be used in the rarest and most exceptional cir-
cumstances. That does not exist relative to 
President Trump, and none was even whis-
pered. And it does not, and will not, exist for 
President Biden. I go on record now to reg-
ister my objection to such loose talk, including 
the formation of a commission to ‘‘investigate’’ 
the 25th Amendment. This is dangerous. It is 
breezy talk, a bit too comfortable about remov-
ing elected officials to replace them. That is 
the sole prerogative of the people every four 
years. 
Section 4 of the 25th Amendment address-
es an incapacitated President unable to make 
the decision to relinquish their duties. As the 
current president is not incapacitated, the cur-
rent effort falls far short. Laughingly short. Im-
probably short. Ridiculously short. 
I restate my call for civility. I call for unity. 
I ask the leftists here, the socialists who want 
to deconstruct this great Nation, to stop the 
nonsense and join with me in building our 
country, not tearing it down. I condemn the vi-
olence we saw all over the United States from 
May to the present, from Portland to Wash-
ington, D.C., led by domestic terrorist organi-
zations like Black Lives Matter and the pro- 
fascist, protocommunist Antifa. I call out the ri-
oters at the Capitol last week and condemn 
their violation of our House proceedings, in-
deed directly stopping me from conducting 
House business. My request for a remand for 
the state legislature to double check electoral 
integrity lost cosponsors and lost immediacy 
because of the violence that day. I thank the 
overwhelmed Capitol Police. 
Unlike some of my colleagues, I note my 
long-term support for our police. It is not a 
fashion for me, as it is others, who condemn 
police and seek to defund it on one day, and 
then after feeling scared and vulnerable, call 
for more police. I remain consistent in my sup-
port for ethical law enforcement. I wish they 
had back up that day and were able to arrest 
and stop any incursion. The leftists in this 
body have brow beaten our law enforcement 
to such a degree the rules of engagement are 
not known to even themselves. All law en-
forcement knows is one mistake and they are 
cancelled. It does not have to be that way. It 
should not be that way. 
For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I stand 
in opposition of the resolution and the invoca-
tion of the 25th Amendment and I voted No. 
Now, more than ever, God bless these United 
States.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT AND 
LIFE’S 
WORK 
OF 
HARLEY 
FRANKEL 
HON. DEBRA A. HAALAND 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021 
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with my colleague, Congressman TED 
LIEU, to honor his constituent and life-long 
education champion, Harley Frankel. We join 
his friends and family in celebrating his retire-
ment from College Match, Harley’s non-profit 
that assists low-income students with applying 
to and excelling in college. 
After a career in public service, Harley 
founded College Match in 2003 after wit-
nessing the steep hurdles his son faced while 
applying to college. As a first-generation col-
lege student himself, Harley realized that the 
grueling and time-consuming application proc-
ess presented far more consequential barriers 
to students in overcrowded schools who often 
lack built-in support, financial safety nets, and 
adequate college guidance. Following this re-
alization, College Match was born, accommo-
dating 40 students in just its first year. The 
program has ballooned to nearly 600 students 
accepted annually, each receiving one-on-one 
guidance from trained college counselors, SAT 
prep, tutoring, assistance with college applica-
tions and essays, and college campus visits. 
In the past 6 years, 95 percent of College 
Match’s students have been admitted to a 
U.S. News and World Report Top 50 college 
or university, and 70 percent were admitted to 
a Top 25 school. 
Harley’s students have deemed him their 
‘‘fairy godfather’’—a reliably approachable, 
friendly, and caring figure determined to help 
put them on the college path they deserve but 
would otherwise be out of reach. Harley’s 
powerful impact on students across Los Ange-
les makes me think of my own academic ca-
reer and the tremendous challenges I faced 
completing my undergraduate, and later my 
law degree as a single mother. No one ever 
told me to go to college, let alone guided me 
through the intimidating college application 
process. The education I received changed 
my life and put me on the path to serving in 
Congress. Every student determined to suc-
ceed should have that opportunity, regardless 
of their background or financial limitations, and 
Harley’s work has helped to make that hap-
pen. 
A born change maker, Harley’s tangible im-
pact on his students will last lifetimes. Even 
more profound is his organization’s direct chal-
lenging of the unfair obstacles that prevent 
some of our country’s brightest minds from 
reaching their full potential. It is an honor to

HONORING COUNCILMEMBER JOHN 
DELL’OSSO 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Cotati City 
Councilmember John Dell’Osso for his three 
terms of distinguished service. Our community 
is deeply grateful for his leadership and advo-
cacy and congratulates him on a well-de-
served retirement. 
A 
resident 
of 
Cotati 
since 
1986, 
Councilmember Dell’Osso has established 
himself as a pillar of our community. A Na-
tional Park Ranger by profession, he worked 
at Point Reyes National Seashore for more 
than 35 years, serving as Chief of Interpreta-
tion and Resource Education and later as 
Public Information Officer until his retirement 
in 2019. In recognition of his exemplary efforts 
in this capacity, he was awarded the U.S. De-
partment of the Interior’s National Partners in 
Conservation Award in 2009 and the National 
Achieving Relevance Award in 2016. 
Throughout his tenure in city government, 
Councilmember Dell’Osso has shown himself 
to be a leader among leaders. In addition to 
serving three terms as Cotati’s Mayor, he sat 
as Chair of the Sonoma County Mayors and 
Councilmembers Association in 2014, offering 
sage advice and wisdom to public leaders 
from across our community. A steadfast sup-
porter of parks and open spaces, and an avid 
bird watcher, Councilmember Dell’Osso distin-
guished himself as an ally to conservationists 
in the city and beyond. As a strong advocate 
for public service, he has no doubt inspired 
many others to follow in his footsteps and fight 
for environmental stewardship, safer neighbor-
hoods, and a stronger economy. 
Aside from his professional and political life, 
he has also devoted himself to philanthropic 
causes. Councilmember Dell’Osso has given 
his time to numerous social benefit organiza-
tions, including stints as a board member of 
both the Rancho Cotate High School Gradua-
tion Project and Friends of the San Pablo Bay 
National Wildlife Refuge. These pursuits fur-
ther evidence his selfless dedication to our 
community. 
Madam Speaker, the City of Cotati is in-
debted to Councilmember John Dell’Osso for 
his years of diligent public service. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor him here 
today.

IMPEACHING 
DONALD 
JOHN 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES, 
FOR 
HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANGIE CRAIG 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, last week, the 
United States Capitol was attacked and defiled 
by insurrectionists. These criminals killed a 
Capitol Police officer and wounded many more 
in a brazen attack not only on this building, 
but on American Democracy itself.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E48 
January 19, 2021 
I am sad, shocked and angry about last 
Wednesday’s events, but I am determined to 
ensure that those responsible are held to ac-
count, including the President of the United 
States. 
The President invited this mob to Wash-
ington. He fueled their rage with false informa-
tion and lies. And then he directed them to the 
U.S. Capitol himself—where they desecrated 
the home of our democracy and put elected 
leaders and law enforcement in danger. None 
of this would have happened without the 
words and deeds of Donald Trump. None of it. 
He threatened our democracy, interfered 
with the transition of power, and imperiled a 
coequal branch of government. There simply 
must be consequences for his indefensible be-
havior. 
Some of my colleagues are now calling for 
unity. I agree. We must unify around the truth. 
That America just completed one of the most 
secure elections in our nation’s history—an 
election that Joe Biden won. The lies stoking 
the flames of insurrection must stop. And 
those perpetuating them must be held ac-
countable. 
I am committed to holding those who 
stormed this building accountable for their ac-
tions. I am committed to defending our democ-
racy. And I am committed to upholding the 
oath to the Constitution that I took just over a 
week ago. 
The President should not serve another day 
in office. And for that reason, I will vote in 
favor of the article of impeachment before me 
today, for my district and for this Nation’s his-
tory. We must never find ourselves here 
again.
