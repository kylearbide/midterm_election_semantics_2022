PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Prince of Peace, give us today Your 
pardon and peace. Pardon the sins of 
our lips, the untrue and unkind words 
we have spoken. Pardon the sins of our 
minds, the ignoring of truth and the re-
fusal to face the facts. Pardon the sins 
of our hearts, the pride that makes us 
esteem ourselves as better than others 
and unwilling to forgive. 
Lord, place Your peace within us, 
that we may no longer be torn by the 
cares of this life. As the Members of 
this body receive Your peace, help 
them to live in unity with each other. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

WILLIAM M. (MAC) THORNBERRY 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION 
ACT 
FOR 
FISCAL 
YEAR 
2021—VETO 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the veto 
message on H.R. 6395 received from the 
House be considered as having been 
read, spread in full upon the Journal, 
and be printed in the RECORD. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The veto message was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD as follows: 
To the House of Representatives: 
I am returning, without my approval, 
H.R. 6395, the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (the 
‘‘Act’’). My Administration recognizes 
the importance of the Act to our na-
tional security. Unfortunately, the Act 
fails to include critical national secu-
rity measures, includes provisions that 
fail to respect our veterans and our 
military’s history, and contradicts ef-
forts by my Administration to put 
America first in our national security 
and foreign policy actions. It is a 
‘‘gift’’ to China and Russia. 
No one has worked harder, or ap-
proved more money for the military, 
than I have—over $2 trillion. During 
my 4 years, with the support of many 
others, we have almost entirely rebuilt 
the United States military, which was 
totally depleted when I took office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7956 
December 29, 2020 
Your failure to terminate the very dan-
gerous national security risk of Sec-
tion 230 will make our intelligence vir-
tually impossible to conduct without 
everyone knowing what we are doing at 
every step. 
The Act fails even to make any 
meaningful changes to Section 230 of 
the Communications Decency Act, de-
spite bipartisan calls for repealing that 
provision. Section 230 facilitates the 
spread of foreign disinformation on-
line, which is a serious threat to our 
national security and election integ-
rity. It must be repealed. 
Additionally, the Act includes lan-
guage that would require the renaming 
of certain military installations. Over 
the course of United States history, 
these locations have taken on signifi-
cance to the American story and those 
who have helped write it that far tran-
scends their namesakes. My Adminis-
tration respects the legacy of the mil-
lions of American servicemen and 
women who have served with honor at 
these military bases, and who, from 
these locations, have fought, bled, and 
died for their country. From these fa-
cilities, we have won two World Wars. 
I have been clear in my opposition to 
politically motivated attempts like 
this to wash away history and to dis-
honor the immense progress our coun-
try has fought for in realizing our 
founding principles. 
The Act also restricts the President’s 
ability to preserve our Nation’s secu-
rity by arbitrarily limiting the amount 
of military construction funds that can 
be used to respond to a national emer-
gency. In a time when adversaries have 
the means to directly attack the home-
land, the President must be able to 
safeguard the American people without 
having to wait for congressional au-
thorization. The Act also contains an 
amendment that would slow down the 
rollout of nationwide 5G, especially in 
rural areas. 
Numerous provisions of the Act di-
rectly contradict my Administration’s 
foreign policy, particularly my efforts 
to bring our troops home. I oppose end-
less wars, as does the American public. 
Over bipartisan objections, however, 
this Act purports to restrict the Presi-
dent’s ability to withdraw troops from 
Afghanistan, 
Germany, 
and 
South 
Korea. Not only is this bad policy, but 
it is unconstitutional. Article II of the 
Constitution makes the President the 
Commander in Chief of the Army and 
Navy of the United States and vests in 
him the executive power. Therefore, 
the 
decision 
regarding 
how 
many 
troops to deploy and where, including 
in Afghanistan, Germany, and South 
Korea, rests with him. The Congress 
may not arrogate this authority to 
itself directly or indirectly as pur-
ported spending restrictions. 
For all of these reasons, I cannot sup-
port this bill. My Administration has 
taken strong actions to help keep our 
Nation safe and support our service 
members. I will not approve this bill, 
which would put the interests of the 
Washington, D.C. establishment over 
those of the American people. It is my 
duty to return H.R. 6395 to the House of 
Representatives without my approval. 
DONALD J. TRUMP.
THE WHITE HOUSE, December 23, 2020. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Congress has returned to work this 
week to enact the 60th annual National 
Defense Authorization Act into law. 
Yesterday, a bipartisan supermajority 
in the House voted to reapprove the 
conference report of this must-pass leg-
islation. Today, the Senate will set up 
a final vote for tomorrow, Wednesday, 
for this Chamber to follow suit. Soon, 
this 
important 
legislation 
will 
be 
passed into law. 
President Trump has rightly noted 
this year’s Defense bill does not con-
tain every provision we Republicans 
would have wanted. I am confident our 
Democrat colleagues feel the same 
way, but that is the case every year. 
Yet for 59 consecutive years and 
counting, Washington has put our dif-
ferences aside, found common ground, 
and passed the annual Defense bill. Not 
once in six decades has a Congress let 
its differences prevent it from com-
pleting this work for our national secu-
rity and our men and women who wear 
the uniform. 
This year’s NDAA will continue our 
momentum in rebuilding and modern-
izing our Armed Forces. It will author-
ize the personnel, equipment, tools, 
and training we need to reinforce the 
national defense strategy and to deter 
great-power rivals like China and Rus-
sia. It will cement our advantage on 
the seas, on land, in the air, in cyber 
space, and in space. The bill will help 
us continue to recruit, retain, and sup-
port the men and women who keep us 
safe. It provides a pay raise for the 
troops, 
improvements 
for 
military 
housing, childcare, and more. 
For the brave men and women of the 
United States and our Armed Forces, 
failure is simply not an option. So 
when it is our turn in Congress to have 
their backs, failure is not an option ei-
ther. 
I would urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation one more time 
when we vote tomorrow. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. On Sunday, Presi-
dent Trump signed into law another bi-
partisan rescue package that will pro-
vide major support to American fami-
lies through what we hope will be the 
home stretch of our fight with the 
coronavirus. 
Congressional Republicans and con-
gressional Democrats and President 
Trump’s senior team had all worked to-
gether to pass hundreds of billions 
more dollars of urgent assistance to 
the people who need it most. 
This new law will set up a targeted 
second round of the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program to save jobs. It will 
renew and continue Federal programs 
that helped laid-off workers endure 
this crisis. It will send more cash to 
households. It will invest billions in 
vaccine distribution so the success of 
Operation Warp Speed kills this pan-
demic as fast as possible, and much 
more. 
This bipartisan compromise was our 
shot at getting help to working fami-
lies on the urgent timeline that they 
need. 
Once again, I want to applaud Presi-
dent Trump for signing the bill and 
getting this much needed assistance 
into the pipeline. 
During this process, the President 
highlighted three additional issues of 
national significance, which he would 
like to see Congress tackle together. 
First, as he explained, the President 
would like further direct financial sup-
port for American households. Second 
is the growing willingness on both 
sides of the aisle to at least reexamine 
the special legal protections afforded 
to technology companies under section 
230 of the Communications Decency 
Act, including the ways that benefit 
some of the most prosperous, most 
powerful ‘‘Big Tech’’ firms. And the 
third subject—since every American, 
regardless of their politics, should feel 
the integrity of our democracy beyond 
reproach—is exploring further ways to 
protect the sanctity of America’s bal-
lots, while continuing to respect the 
Federal Government’s limited role in 
standing behind State and local elec-
tions authorities who actually run 
elections. 
Those are the three important sub-
jects the President has linked together. 
This week, the Senate will begin a 
process to bring these three priorities 
into focus. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3985 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I move to proceed to Calendar No. 480, 
S. 3985. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report the bill by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3985) to improve and reform polic-
ing practices, accountability and trans-
parency. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that following leader remarks 
on Wednesday, December 30, the time 
until 1:15 be equally divided between 
proponents and opponents of the bill, 
with opponent time being controlled by 
Senator PAUL or his designee; further, 
that upon the use or yielding back of 
that time, the Senate vote on passage 
of the bill, the objections of the Presi-
dent to the contrary notwithstanding; 
finally, if passed, the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon

debate. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object, the Senate is here this week 
for a rare holiday session to address 
two major issues: the President’s veto 
of the annual Defense bill and the ef-
fort to send $2,000 survival checks to 
millions and millions of American fam-
ilies, 
something 
Senate 
Democrats 
strongly support. 
The Senate should be in session to 
address both issues. There are only a 
few days left in this session. We should 
not adjourn until the Senate holds a 
vote on both measures—the NDAA veto 
override and the House bill to provide 
$2,000 checks for the American people. 
As we all know, the majority leader 
controls the schedule on the floor. So 
Leader MCCONNELL holds the key to 
unlocking this dilemma. The solution 
is a simple one: Put both bills up for a 
simple up-or-down vote and then let 
the chips fall where they may. I believe 
both measures will pass, as they 
should. But Leader MCCONNELL must 
allow the Senate to vote on both pieces 
of legislation, the Defense bill and the 
$2,000 checks, before we go home. We 
will start the process on overriding the 
President’s veto of the Defense bill to-
morrow. 
Today, at the end of my remarks, I 
will ask the Senate’s consent to take 
up the House-passed bill to provide the 
American people immediate survival 
checks of $2,000 a person. 
Throughout this pandemic, working 
Americans have taken it on the chin. 
Right now, they are facing their hard-
est and their darkest days. Tens of mil-
lions have lost their jobs. Tens of mil-
lions are struggling to put food on the 
table, to keep a roof over their heads. 
In the wealthiest Nation on Earth, 
modern-day 
breadlines 
stretch 
for 
miles down American highways. 
The fastest way to get money into 
Americans’ pockets is to send some of 
their tax dollars right back from where 
they came. And $2,000 stimulus checks 
could mean the difference between 
American families having groceries for 
a few extra weeks or going hungry, the 
difference between paying the rent or 
being kicked out of your home that 
you have lived in for years. It would 
buy precious time for tens of millions 
of people as the vaccine thankfully 
makes its way across the country. Of 
course, we could have taken up this 
issue weeks ago. 
In the COVID bill Congress just 
passed, Democrats wanted generous di-
rect payments to the American people. 
Speaker PELOSI and I repeatedly asked 
our Republican counterparts how much 
they could support. Their answer: $600. 
It was a compromise many of us were 
not happy about. I came to the floor 
myself with the Senator from Vermont 
to ask that we double at least the size 
of those checks. A Republican Senator 
objected. Six hundred dollars was the 
most Republicans would support. 
Well, my colleagues and my fellow 
Americans, $600 is not enough. It is not 
enough for the mother in Nashville 
$4,000 behind on the rent whose water 
was shut off earlier this month; not for 
the medical receptionist in Macomb 
$2,100 behind on the rent, whole elec-
tricity shut off in September on her 
son’s third day of virtual kindergarten; 
not for the 12 million Americans who 
have fallen on average nearly $6,000 be-
hind on their rent and their utilities or 
the 26 million Americans who have had 
trouble putting food on the table in the 
past 5 days. Six hundred dollars? Nope. 
It is not enough. 
So in a moment, I will move to have 
the Senate take up the House bill to in-
crease that number to $2,000, which, I 
might add, had broad bipartisan sup-
port. I don’t want to hear that we can’t 
afford it. I don’t want to hear that it 
would add too much to the deficit. Sen-
ate Republicans added nearly $2 tril-
lion to the deficit to give corporations 
a massive tax cut. Republicans just 
fought to include a tax break for three- 
martini lunches in the COVID relief 
bill. So I don’t want to hear that it 
costs too much to help working fami-
lies get a check when they are strug-
gling to keep their jobs, pay their rent, 
feed their families, and live a halfway 
normal and decent life. 
Even in our deeply divided times, 
this issue has united Americans from 
coast to coast and bridged the massive 
political divide here in Washington. A 
vast majority of the public, Republican 
and Democrat, strongly supports $2,000 
checks. An overwhelming bipartisan 
majority in the House supports $2,000 
checks. Senate Democrats strongly 
support $2,000 checks. Even President 
Trump supports $2,000 checks. 
There is one question left today: Do 
Senate Republicans join with the rest 
of America in supporting $2,000 checks? 
Now, some of my Republican col-
leagues have said they support the 
checks, but there is a major difference 
in saying you support $2,000 checks and 
fighting to put them into law. The 
House bill is the only way—the only 
way—to deliver these stimulus checks 
before the end of session. 
Will Senate Republicans fight for a 
vote on the House-passed CASH Act, or 
will they look some other way? Will 
Senate Republicans stand against the 
House of Representatives, the Demo-
cratic majority in the Senate, and the 
President of their own party to prevent 
these $2,000 checks from going out the 
door? We are about to get the answers 
to these questions. 
So now, Madam President, would the 
Senator modify his request to include a 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 9051, a bill received from 
the House to increase recovery rebate 
amounts to $2,000 per individual; that 
the bill be read a third time and passed 
and the motion to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate? 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection to the modi-
fication? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I object 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, we should 
all be very, very clear. The working 
class of this country today faces more 
economic desperation than at any time 
since the Great Depression of the 1930s, 
and working families need help now— 
not next year but right now. 
Last night, the House of Representa-
tives, with a two-thirds majority—275 
to 134, a two-thirds bipartisan vote— 
moved to increase the direct payment 
going to working families from $600 per 
adult to $2,000 per adult. The House did 
the right thing; I congratulate them. 
Now it is time for the Senate to step up 
to the plate and do what the working 
families of this country overwhelm-
ingly want us to do. 
Madam President, as a result of the 
pandemic, tens of millions of Ameri-
cans have lost their jobs and their in-
comes. These families, in the middle of 
the winter, now face the threat of evic-
tion 
and 
the 
possibility 
of 
being 
thrown out in the streets. Hunger in 
America is at the highest level that it 
has been for decades, with moms and 
dads struggling to feed their kids and 
working families lining up mile after 
mile to get emergency food packages. 
We are even seeing an increase in gro-
cery store shoplifting as desperate 
Americans try to keep their families 
from going hungry. All of this is taking 
place in the wealthiest country in the 
history of the world. 
Over the last number of years, as I 
think everybody in America knows, 
Congress has provided massive tax 
breaks for the very wealthiest people 
in our country, which is one of the rea-
sons why today we have more income 
and wealth inequality than any time 
since the 1920s. In fact, in the midst of 
this pandemic, this terrible pandemic, 
inequality has grown worse, with many 
in the billionaire class seeing their 
wealth increase by hundreds of billions 
of dollars while average Americans 
struggle to put food on the table. 
Congress has given huge tax breaks 
to large corporations so that some of 
the most profitable and largest cor-
porations in America today pay zero in 
Federal income taxes. 
We have just passed the largest mili-
tary budget in the history of our coun-
try—$740 billion, more than the next 10 
nations combined. By the way, there 
was almost no debate about the size of 
that huge budget. Trump’s veto dealt 
with other issues. 
Meanwhile, over half a million Amer-
icans are homeless, half of our working 
families are struggling to survive pay-
check to paycheck, and in the midst of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7958 
December 29, 2020 
this terrible, unprecedented pandemic, 
over 90 million Americans are unin-
sured or underinsured. In the midst of 
a pandemic, they are not sure whether 
they can afford to go to a doctor. 
We are coming to the close of one of 
the most terrible and painful years in 
American history. That is a tragic fact. 
Over 330,000 of our people have died of 
COVID–19, and, as we speak, we are see-
ing recordbreaking numbers of new 
cases, and hospitals around the coun-
try are being overwhelmed with new 
admissions. 
During the last year, the education 
and well-being of tens of millions of 
our young people, from childcare to 
graduate school, has been disrupted. 
The terrible emotional isolation this 
pandemic has caused, where people are 
unable to spend time with their fami-
lies and friends, has resulted in a huge 
increase in mental illness, drug addic-
tion, and even suicide. 
As I mentioned, the House has done 
the right thing. By an overwhelming 
vote, Democrats and Republicans voted 
to increase that $600 direct payment to 
$2,000. A recent poll came out, and 78 
percent of the American people think 
that was the right decision. They are 
hurting. They want help. The leaders of 
our country—President Trump, Presi-
dent-Elect 
Biden, 
Minority 
Leader 
CHUCK SCHUMER, the Speaker of the 
House, NANCY PELOSI—are all in agree-
ment: We have to raise that direct pay-
ment to $2,000. 
So that is where we are right now in 
this historic moment. Do we turn our 
backs on struggling working families, 
or do we respond to their pain? 
So, Madam President, would the Sen-
ator modify his request that imme-
diately following the vote on the veto 
override, the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of H.R. 9051; that the bill 
be considered read a third time and the 
Senate vote on passage of the bill with 
no intervening action or debate; fur-
ther, that, if passed, the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table? 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection to the request 
for modification? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
Is there objection to the original? 
Mr. SANDERS. I object.

MORNING BUSINESS 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

Senate will be in a period of morning 
business, with Senators permitted to

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, this 
is our historic moment. We can see the 
suffering across our country. We can 
see how desperate people are. We can 
see how during this holiday season, the 
people are looking at the prospect, in 
the words of Tony Fauci, where the 
worst may be ahead of us for these 
families. The worst may yet to have 
been actually inflicted upon families 
and our country. Yet the Republicans 
are refusing to allow for a vote on giv-
ing each individual $2,000 in order to 
make it through the rest of this pan-
demic. 
Senator SANDERS today speaks for 
the millions of Americans who are suf-
fering through a devastating health 
crisis, an unemployment crisis, an 
eviction crisis, a hunger crisis, and a 
crisis of faith—faith that their leaders 
in this country will stand up and pro-
vide for Americans in their hour of 
need. 
Meanwhile, we here in Washington 
must confront a moral crisis: Why 
can’t we keep working families from 
starving even as we stand ready to ap-
prove a massive defense bill? 
That is why I am here with my col-
league BERNIE SANDERS to call for a 
simple vote to provide $2,000 in direct 
cash payments to Americans across our 
country. It is this simple. Just like 
they did in the House of Representa-
tives, the Senate should have a vote— 
up or down, yes or no—on providing 
these increased cash payments to des-
perate Americans. We can get this done 
quickly and before the holiday if Lead-
er MCCONNELL will simply agree to do 
it. They already had this vote in the 
House, and 44 Republicans voted for it. 
Give the Republicans in the Senate the 
same opportunity to vote. We already 
know that many of them have already 
said they will vote for the $2,000 if they 
get a chance to vote. It is this simple. 
We can do this because a simple vote 
will just say that you want to provide 
a grand total of $2,000 to Americans 
who need it to pay the rent, to keep 
the electricity on, to buy diapers, to 
pay for lifesaving medication—just to 
survive 
this 
devastating 
pandemic. 
There are 44 House Republicans who 
voted for the $2,000 checks. I believe 
that the Republicans in this Chamber 
will do so as well, and President Trump 
has already made it very clear that he 
will sign the bill. So we can see where 
the opposition is. It is with the leader-
ship of the Republicans in the U.S. 
Senate. 
People across our country are falling 
ill and falling behind on their bills, and 
for the families of the hundreds of 
thousands 
who 
have 
died 
from 
coronavirus, the medical and funeral 
expenses are compounding their grief. 
They need money in their pockets. 
In Massachusetts, this past Sunday, 
we hit 100 deaths in a single day—the 
highest death toll our State has seen in 
a 24-hour period since the very begin-
ning of this pandemic. In the week be-
fore Christmas, 21,000 new people in our 
State applied for unemployment bene-
fits just as Donald Trump let these pro-
tections lapse before millions of Ameri-
cans lost their benefits, and that is a 
tragedy. 
A $2,000 check is the most direct and 
effective mechanism for delivering eco-
nomic relief right now to those who are 
barely holding on throughout this cri-
sis, particularly low-income Ameri-
cans, immigrant communities, and our 
gig and service workers—our essential 
workers. They need help. They have 
been helping our families, and we need 
to help their families. Right now, these 
checks would help 158 million people 
across our country pay for housing, put 
food on the table, and make sure that 
grandma and grandpa have their diabe-
tes or heart medication. 
That is why Senator SANDERS, Sen-
ator KAMALA HARRIS, and I introduced 
legislation to provide every person in 
our country, regardless of immigration 
status, with $2,000 monthly recurring 
payments in order to help weather this 
storm. We knew then, 7 months ago, 
that a single $1,200 relief check was not 
going to be enough to help families get 
by, and the $600 payment in the latest 
coronavirus package is a crumb to the 
working people who have faced eco-
nomic hardship through no fault of 
their own. It won’t even cover a month 
of rent, let alone heating bills, food 
bills, Wi-Fi bills for students who are 
learning from home, and all of the 
other expenses that are piling up for 
these families. 
Now, some of my Republican col-
leagues have said that providing $2,000 
would be too expensive. Well, here are 
some other costs they seem to have 
forgotten. If our proposal to increase 
stimulus checks to $2,000 is soaring, 
the overall cost of the stimulus bill 
would go from $900 billion to $1.36 tril-
lion. Yes, that is a $464 billion increase 
over what we were currently projecting 
for this bill, but it is only a fraction of 
the $740 billion Defense bill that this 
Chamber stands ready to approve again 
this week. 
I hate to say this, but my Republican 
colleagues seem to be more interested 
in funding defense than in funding the 
defenseless, and that is what this de-
bate is all about. What do we do to help 
these defenseless families? In this mo-
ment of national crisis, we were able to 
afford spending three-quarters of a tril-
lion dollars on a bloated defense budg-
et—spending that was supposed to pro-
tect our country yet did nothing to in-
oculate against the most profound pub-
lic health emergency in a century—but 
we can’t give hungry and suffering 
Americans $2,000? That is a moral fail-
ure for our country. Give Americans 
this money. 
Most of my colleagues support this 
defense budget. They got to vote on it 
a few weeks ago, and I know they stand 
ready to override President Trump’s 
racist, belligerent veto. We are here 
today, asking the same thing for $2,000 
payments—a simple up-or-down vote. 
Let’s bring the House bill up for a vote. 
Leader SCHUMER is committed to bring-
ing it forward. We can get this done be-
fore the holiday. We can do this for 
Americans before the year is out.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7959 
December 29, 2020 
We must remember that what makes 
America the envy of the world is not 
simply the strength of our defense and 
military but the strength of our peo-
ple—people like Ahmed Jaya, a parent 
of three, who was laid off from his job 
as a doorman at the Omni Parker 
House in Boston this past March. 
Ahmed receives $400 a week in unem-
ployment benefits, but it is not enough 
to cover the bills that keep rolling in 
as he now faces expiring health cov-
erage as well. It is people like Tanya 
DiStefano, from Spencer, MA, who 
gave birth to a beautiful baby boy on 
Halloween, to return from the hospital 
to find an eviction notice taped to the 
front of her door. These are the stories 
that should be driving our fights. These 
are the people who need relief now. And 
these checks will go right back into 
our economy because people will spend 
this money. They need it for the neces-
sities that are confronting their fami-
lies right now. 
Last week, Donald Trump used these 
people as political pawns. He stalled 
signing the coronavirus relief package, 
claiming that he wanted to give $2,000 
checks to every American. By delay-
ing, President Trump may have stiffed 
unemployed Americans out of $300 this 
week in unemployment benefits—bene-
fits that they will not get back. So 
let’s now hold Donald Trump to his 
word. Let’s bring this to a vote, and 
let’s pass $2,000 relief checks for every 
person in our country and put that bill 
on Donald Trump’s desk. 
This pandemic has laid bare the trag-
edy of two Americas—one in which bil-
lionaires have grown their wealth by 
$931 billion over the course of this pan-
demic, an America where the rich con-
tinue to get richer, and the other 
America that has seen unprecedented 
economic uncertainty, Great Depres-
sion-level unemployment rates, and 
devastating losses. It is one in which 
Blacks and LatinX workers suffer dis-
proportionately higher rates of unem-
ployment and their families suffer 
higher rates of coronavirus infection 
and death; where workers get laid off 
while CEOs get raises and companies 
engage in stock buyback plans; and 
where residents get evicted or their 
electricity shut off but major corpora-
tions barely pay taxes. 
For those workers and families and 
struggling households in America—for 
the very vast majority of America— 
$2,000 is a lifeline, and it is time for 
Leader MCCONNELL to bring this legis-
lation to the floor for a vote. The 
American people have a right to know 
where every Member of the Senate 
stands on this issue. They now know 
where President Trump says he stands, 
and they now know where every Mem-
ber of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives stands. The American people have 
a right to know, in this desperate time 
that we are living through, who was on 
their side to give their families the 
help they needed. 
Senator SANDERS is right. We should 
have a vote—it should be yes or no— 
and we should do this before the end of 
this year. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Connecticut. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
MURPHY. 
Madam 
President, 
America has 600 billionaires. Now, $1 
billion doesn’t sound like a lot of 
money these days. President Trump 
just signed a bill, begrudgingly, that 
has $900 billion in it. But trust me—$1 
billion is still a whole lot of money. It 
is actually so much money that it is 
really hard to find words to describe 
what it looks like, but let me try. 
If you are, for instance, one of the 
half a million Americans who make the 
minimum wage in this Nation and are 
lucky enough to work 40 hours a week, 
guess how many years you would have 
to work in order to get $1 billion. Five 
hundred years? A thousand years? Ten 
thousand years? No, you are not even 
close. If you make minimum wage in 
America today, you would need to 
work for 75,000 years in order to make 
$1 billion—75,000 years. Neanderthals 
were roaming the Earth 75,000 years 
ago. Those guys, if they had made min-
imum wage, would have had to have 
worked up until present day, every sin-
gle day—that is, of course, if they 
hadn’t spent a dime of the money they 
had made in order to accrue $1 billion. 
One billion dollars is a bananas 
amount of money, and there are 600 
people in America today who make at 
least that amount of money or have 
that amount of money to their names. 
That is crazy. With $1 billion, you are 
leading a life that, frankly, none of us 
can really imagine, right? You have 
private planes. You have yachts. You 
have household staffs in the dozens. 
You have enough money to make sure 
that your children and your grand-
children and your great-grandchildren 
and 
your 
great-great-grandchildren 
never have to work a day in their lives. 
Generations of your offspring can just 
live lives of indolent luxury, without a 
care, if they so choose. 
Do you know where I was 2 days be-
fore Thanksgiving this year? I was at 
Hamden Middle School, in my State, to 
help hand out free food for the unem-
ployed, the poor, and the disabled 
ahead of a long holiday weekend. Those 
long weekends can be really hard, espe-
cially the ones that fall at the end of 
the month when the SNAP benefits 
have long run out. I got there as dark-
ness fell but right at the beginning of 
the event. I noticed that down the hill 
from the roundabout at the school at 
which they were handing out the food, 
there was usually an empty parking 
lot. That night, at that moment, at the 
beginning of the event, that parking 
lot was lit up by hundreds of sets of 
headlights of hundreds of cars that 
were just sitting there, idle, in that 
parking lot. 
I asked the organizer of the event 
what was going on in that parking lot. 
Was there some other event happening 
that evening? Why all the cars? 
He told me: The cars started pulling 
into that lot hours ago. They got wind 
we were handing out food, and they got 
here early to make sure they didn’t get 
left out. We have enough food for 300 
people, and there were 300 cars in that 
lot before I even got here. 
That is what has happened during 
this pandemic. Millions of families all 
across this Nation, through no fault of 
their own, have lost their jobs or have 
had their hours dramatically cut back. 
They have no savings because work 
doesn’t pay in this country anymore. 
They spend everything they earn each 
month. 
So when the economy collapsed, vir-
tually overnight in the spring, they got 
desperate—really fast. 
I want you to think about what it is 
really like on an hour-to-hour basis 
when you don’t have enough money for 
food for your family. The decisions you 
have to make every single day are 
practically animalistic. Do you make 
your kids go hungry during the day, 
when they need the most energy, or do 
you skimp on dinner and force your 
kids to go to bed with hunger pangs? 
There are hundreds of thousands of 
mothers and fathers who, right now, as 
I am speaking, are making that deci-
sion today. That is the reality of this 
pandemic. 
But here is another reality: Those 600 
billionaires in this country? As it turns 
out, as a group, they lost nothing— 
nothing—during this pandemic. No, ex-
actly the opposite. They got richer. 
The wealthiest 600 Americans collec-
tively added $1 trillion to their bank 
accounts. Let me say it again. The 
richest 600 Americans gained $1 trillion 
over the course of 2020. 
Let’s be clear. That is not money 
that grew in their money tree or-
chards. Yes, we are printing some more 
money these days, but wealth isn’t far 
away from a zero-sum game still. So 
when we allow for 600 people in the 
country to control 50 percent of the 
Nation’s wealth, that is coming out of 
your pocket. 
Six hundred people in a country of 
328 million isn’t a lot of people. But do 
you know what is a smaller number 
than 600? Fifty-two. 
There are 52 Republicans in this 
Chamber—52 people who are going to 
have a decision to make about what to 
do in a country where millions are lit-
erally starving as we speak, while 600 
billionaires count the $1 trillion in ad-
ditional wealth that they have accu-
mulated during this period of national 
calamity. 
The question before these 52 Senate 
Republicans is simple. It is simple: 
Should we give $2,000 to low- and mid-
dle-income Americans right now to 
help them survive this crisis? That is 
the decision Senate Republicans have 
to make right now. Time is running 
out. 
Six hundred billionaires got $1 tril-
lion richer this year, and the question

December 29, 2020 
before Senate Republicans is this: Are 
you willing to spend an amount equal 
to just half of that windfall to Amer-
ica’s billionaires in order to help 160 
million Americans? 
Right now, the 52 Senate Republicans 
serving in this Chamber are the only 
thing standing in the way of $2,000 
being sent to 160 million of our need-
iest citizens. 
The House passed the bill authorizing 
the checks in a big, bipartisan vote. It 
is hard to get two-thirds of the House 
of Representatives to agree on what 
time it is, but two-thirds of the House 
of Representatives voted for the $2,000 
checks. President Trump supports the 
$2,000 checks, so he will sign the bill if 
the Senate sends it to him. We can vote 
on the House bill today in a matter of 
hours if Senate Republicans agree. 
So why isn’t this happening? Why 
didn’t Senator MCCONNELL
announce 
the schedule for the vote on the $2,000 
checks bill? Why didn’t he agree to 
Senator SCHUMER’s request to bring it 
up for an immediate vote? 
Now, a lot of Republicans are saying 
they object to the payments because 
they cost too much and they are going 
to add too much to the deficit. Well, 
frankly, spare me the fake righteous 
indignation about the deficit all of a 
sudden. 
Three years ago, these same deficit 
hawk Republicans passed a tax cut bill 
that, before the pandemic hit, had al-
ready added over $200 billion to the an-
nual deficit, and that was a tax cut 
where 80 percent of the benefits went 
to the richest 1 percent of Americans. 
Warren Buffet wrote in his note to 
investors last year that the deficit-fi-
nanced tax cuts earned his empire $29 
billion overnight. That windfall, Buffet 
noted, ‘‘did not come from anything we 
accomplished at Berkshire.’’ So it is 
funny: Deficits just didn’t matter to 
the 52 when it was tax cuts to the 600 
richest people in America. 
But even if this Congress weren’t 
ending in 5 days and we had time to 
figure out how to pay for it, do you 
know how we can’t pay for it? Cutting 
foreign aid. 
President Trump has been talking a 
lot about foreign aid in the last week. 
Now, the money we spend on foreign 
aid, all supported by Democrats and 
Republicans over the years, all of it 
smart investments in our Nation’s se-
curity—that actually wasn’t in the 
COVID relief package. It was in the an-
nual budget, as it always is. It just so 
happens that this year the COVID re-
lief package and the annual budget 
were passed together. 
But just for argument’s sake, let’s 
say Trump got his way and every sin-
gle dollar of foreign aid was cut out of 
the budget. Would that pay for the 
$2,000 checks? Not even close. President 
Trump apparently has an oversized im-
pression of how much money we spend 
on foreign aid, because our annual for-
eign aid spending doesn’t even equal 10 
percent of the cost of a one-time $2,000 
payment to low- and middle-income 
citizens. 
There is also some speculation that 
Senator MCCONNELL is going to join to-
gether the $2,000 payments with other, 
much more controversial measures, 
much more complicated measures, like 
the reform of our internet liability 
laws. That is an invitation for this en-
tire effort to fall apart. 
The House has finished voting. They 
have passed the $2,000 payment bill and 
sent it to us. They are not interested in 
taking up anything else. If we start 
adding poison pills to the $2,000 pay-
ment bill, that is just another way of 
telling the American people that this 
body doesn’t support $2,000 payments. 
Listen, being a billionaire must be 
crazy. I make a lot of money as a Sen-
ator, but even I would have to work 
7,500 years before my earnings equaled 
$1 billion. You know what was hap-
pening $7,500 years ago? The Stone Age. 
There isn’t a good reason to oppose 
giving Americans who aren’t billion-
aires a measly $2,000 check to help 
them put food on the table for their 
kids in the middle of this once-in-a- 
lifetime crisis. 
There isn’t a good reason to choose 
to make moms and dads all across this 
country decide which two meals they 
will feed their kids each day because 
three meals are not an option. Two 
thousand dollars doesn’t put dinner on 
the table every night, but, man, going 
to bed hungry when you are 11—it 
sucks. And even dealing with it every 
other night instead of every single 
night, no kid is going to turn that 
down. 
There are 52 of you, and in the next 
24 to 48 hours, you get to decide: Do 
you protect the billionaires or do you 
choose to feed that 11-year-old kid? 
The only thing that stands between the 
American people and a $2,000 emer-
gency survival check is 52 Senate Re-
publicans. Got it? Understand? 
There is a bill pending right now be-
fore the Senate that gives $2,000 to or-
dinary Americans. Yes, it costs a lot of 
money, and maybe down the line we 
will have to ask the billionaires to pay 
for it, but the bill is here right now. 
The legislative session expires in 5 
days. President Trump says he will 
sign it, and all that matters right now 
is what these 52 people decide. 
The House passed the bill with lots of 
Democratic and Republican support. 
The President supports the idea. The 
only thing that can stop $2,000 pay-
ments to struggling Americans right 
now is 52 Senate Republicans. 
Some things in Washington aren’t 
that simple—but this is. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COL-
LINS). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we 
didn’t expect to be in session this 
week, but we are. And, of course, as we 
all know, the theme for this entire 
year has been ‘‘COVID–19 writ large.’’ 
More than 330,000 Americans have 
died from the novel coronavirus. Tens 
of millions have lost their jobs, and 
every community across the country 
has felt the devastating blow dealt by 
this pandemic, but, as we know, the 
threats that existed long before this 
virus still are with us. Even though 
most of the world hit pause to battle 
COVID–19, our adversaries did not, and 
our brave servicemembers didn’t pack 
their bags and not show up for work 
when everybody else shut down. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the 
last several months, as the Senate has 
worked to support our country through 
this pandemic, we have kept an eagle 
eye on the other threats on the hori-
zon, and we passed the National De-
fense Authorization Act to ensure that 
we are prepared for whatever comes at 
us. 
For our forces to continue fighting 
and defeating our adversaries in every 
corner of the world, they need funding. 
They need stability. They need to be 
able to plan, and they need the unwav-
ering support of the U.S. Congress and 
all 330 million Americans. 
The 2021 NDAA provides that support 
from Congress. It will prepare our mili-
tary and servicemembers to address 
the threats that exist today, while pre-
paring for those that we will inevitably 
face tomorrow. 
Earlier this month, this legislation 
passed the House by a vote of 335 to 78 
and the Senate by a vote of 84 to 13. 
Those are rare vote margins in Con-
gress these days, and that alone is a 
testament to the importance of this 
legislation and its bipartisan support. 
We know the President has the con-
stitutional authority to veto any bill 
for virtually any reason, and he has ex-
ercised that power with this legisla-
tion. The reasons the President has 
given I don’t think are frivolous at all, 
but they just shouldn’t be tagged to 
this particular piece of legislation. His 
concerns about section 230 under the 
Communication Decency Act and the 
power of these social media platforms 
that censure speech is troubling in-
deed. This is something we really 
haven’t confronted before. We know 
that under the First Amendment, the 
government can’t censure speech, but 
with smalltown newspapers and media 
outlets and other alternatives fading 
away, more and more the American 
people rely on Facebook and Google 
and other internet platforms to get 
their information, and they have, I be-
lieve, become de facto public forums. 
So I agree that we do need to address 
section 230 of the Communications De-
cency Act, as the President has pointed 
out.

The President also has a point about 
the Commission to rename military 
bases that are part of the Defense Au-
thorization Act. Unfortunately, the 
amendment that was adopted in the 
Armed Services Committee undermines 
the role of Congress, once the Commis-
sion makes its report, to do as Con-
gress believes should be done. But the 
truth is, as we have learned from our 
friends across the pond in the UK, no 
Parliament can bind a future Par-
liament, and indeed no Congress can 
bind a future Congress. That is true. So 
if these are things the President be-
lieves we should address and that Mem-
bers of Congress and the new adminis-
tration believe we should address, we 
will address them, and we have an op-
portunity to do that, but we should not 
try to do that on this bill and risk the 
loss of this important piece of legisla-
tion now in its 60th year of adoption. 
The Defense Department is hands 
down the largest employer in the 
United States, with nearly 2.9 million 
employees, including both servicemem-
bers and civilians. These men and 
women can be found in more than 160 
countries around the world and on all 
seven continents. Supporting them is a 
Herculean task, and the NDAA is a sig-
nificant way in which we do that. 
The Defense authorization bill also 
includes a 3-percent pay raise for our 
troops and additional support for their 
families, such as career support for 
military spouses and quality childcare 
on military bases. Given the fact that 
we have an All-Volunteer military, it 
is important we not only support our 
servicemembers who wear the uniform 
but the families who support them as 
well. I have heard it said, you can re-
cruit a member of the U.S. military, 
but if you want to retain them, you 
have to take care of their family, and 
I believe that is absolutely true. 
This bill also ensures previous re-
forms to improve the quality of mili-
tary housing and healthcare are imple-
mented appropriately. Those who serve 
in our military have made tremendous 
sacrifices in order to safeguard our 
freedoms and our way of life. I regard 
our support for them and for our na-
tional defense the No. 1 priority of the 
Federal Government. Everything else 
pales in significance. So we should do 
everything in our power to ensure that 
they and their families are appro-
priately taken care of. 
Beyond pay and benefits, that means 
giving the military members the train-
ing, the facilities, and the equipment 
they need not only to succeed on the 
job but to return home safely. 
The NDAA authorizes military con-
struction projects across the country, 
including $183 million in Texas, which 
will bring serious updates and improve-
ments to our military bases. At Joint 
Base San Antonio, this funding will 
provide for a range of new facilities, in-
cluding a barracks, a flight simulation 
system, and an F–16 Mission Training 
Center. 
At Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, it 
will support an F–35 operations and 
maintenance facility, vehicle mainte-
nance shop, and an aircraft mainte-
nance hangar. It will also support fuel 
facilities at Fort Hood and provide ad-
ditional funding for the Pantex Plant 
in Amarillo, which maintains a large 
portion of our nuclear stockpile. Main-
tained and modernized facilities are a 
critical component to military readi-
ness, and this legislation makes tre-
mendous investments in our facilities 
around the world. It will authorize 93 
new F–35 Joint Strike Fighters that 
will be built by Texans in Fort Worth. 
As we work to counter increasingly so-
phisticated 
adversaries 
around 
the 
world, this investment in our military 
readiness could not be more important. 
In addition to supporting our mem-
bers in uniform and ensuring they are 
ready for action when called upon, the 
NDAA helps our military take stock of 
the evolving threat landscape and en-
sures that our country is taking active 
steps to counter threats on the horizon. 
In recent years, China and Russia 
have risen to the top of the threats to 
our country and to world order, with 
China now assuming the No. 1 role. We 
remember the Cold War after World 
War II, where we sought to contain and 
counter Soviet expansionism, and, ac-
tually, the mutual deterrents that we 
have established during that time has 
worked. But China is a unique chal-
lenge, and none of the old rules apply 
to China. 
They are increasingly belligerent and 
well resourced and continue to dem-
onstrate a lack of respect not only for 
the United States and our closest allies 
but for basic human rights. 
The Chinese Government continues 
its disturbing and unacceptable geno-
cide against the Uighur people. The so- 
called political reeducation camps are 
nothing 
more 
than 
concentration 
camps where Uighurs are tortured. Re-
cent reporting has found that the 
treatment in these camps often in-
cludes forced abortions, birth control, 
and sterilization. And China continues 
to chip away at the freedoms and au-
tonomy of Hong Kong, notwithstanding 
its promises to the contrary, using a 
so-called national security law to ex-
tinguish opposition to the Chinese 
Communist Party and to deny the peo-
ple of Hong Kong the freedoms that 
they were promised. 
As 
I 
mentioned, 
though, 
China 
doesn’t stand alone as a threat to the 
world. Russia has become increasingly 
aggressive around the world in its ef-
fort to wreak chaos and sow discord. 
Since their attempts to interfere with 
the 2016 election, we have witnessed ag-
gression after aggression from Russia, 
not just here in the cyber space but 
around the world. 
From 
Russia-backed 
mercenaries 
fighting in the Middle East to its at-
tempt to steal the coronavirus vaccine 
research and, in the last few weeks, a 
massive cyber attack on U.S. Govern-
ment agencies, Russia continues to un-
dermine the United States and our al-
lies and shows no signs of stopping. 
It has become increasingly clear, if it 
wasn’t already, that China and Russia 
adhere to no rules and no principles 
but their own. As the national defense 
strategy outlined, the threats posed by 
these two countries are increasingly 
dangerous, and countering these grow-
ing threats requires a clear and con-
centrated effort from Congress. That is 
exactly why passing the NDAA—the 
National Defense Authorization Act—is 
so important. 
This legislation prioritizes strategic 
competition with China and Russia and 
takes a strong approach to counter the 
threats posed by adversaries around 
the world. It will build on the progress 
we have made in recent years to 
strengthen our military after the dra-
conian cuts during the Obama-Biden 
administration 
and 
achieve 
peace 
through strength. 
Over the last several decades, the 
NDAA has provided an annual oppor-
tunity for us to take stock of the 
evolving threat landscape and ensure 
that our national defense is prepared to 
meet the challenges not only of today 
but of tomorrow, and this year’s De-
fense Authorization Act is no excep-
tion. 
It takes a strong approach to counter 
the threats posed by our adversaries 
around the world. It invests in modern-
ized national defense that is critical to 
maintaining peace through strength, 
and it provides support for our service-
members and their families. Above all, 
it sends a message to the world that 
our country is and will remain the 
global military leader. 
I have supported this legislation on 
the Senate floor many times, and I will 
do so once again when the opportunity 
to vote to override the veto presents 
itself. 
One of Congress’s most critical re-
sponsibilities is to provide for the com-
mon defense, and the NDAA—the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act—is 
how we will deliver. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I was 
disappointed last week when President 
Trump vetoed the NDAA. 
This will be the 60th year that we 
have had the NDAA. The NDAA is the 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
and I have said so many times, count-
less times—on the floor of the House 
and on the floor of the Senate—that 
this is the most important bill that we 
have. Some people don’t agree with 
that, but I do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7962 
December 29, 2020 
That is what we are supposed to be 
doing here. We are supposed to be de-
fending America. And there is a lot to 
do. We are in the most threatening sit-
uation that we have ever been in. 
I sometimes look back and think of 
the good old days of the Cold War when 
you had two superpowers out there. We 
knew what they had; they knew what 
we had. Mutual assurance of destruc-
tion meant something at that time. If 
you kill us, we kill you, and everyone 
is happy. 
But that is living in the past. But 
anymore now, with the weaponry that 
is out there, you can get one outside 
group that doesn’t have any resources 
at all, and they have the ability to 
wipe out another country. So it is a 
real threat that we are up against. 
I do chair the committee called the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, 
and, of course, I have been very active 
in the National Defense Authorization 
Act every year since—well, since 1987. 
It is a long time. 
So I am proud of the conference re-
port that we had. The NDAA right 
here—our vote in this Senate was 84 to 
13. Wow. You can’t find that kind of to-
getherness in a cause anywhere else. 
But it puts members of the families of 
the military first. 
I share President Trump’s frustration 
about section 230. I know that it is a 
complicated thing. The majority of 
people in America don’t know what 
that is all about, but section 230 is 
something that has nothing to do with 
the military—nothing at all. 
The committee that I chair is the 
Armed 
Services 
Committee. 
That 
would be found in the jurisdiction of 
the Judiciary Committee. The Judici-
ary Committee is chaired by Senator 
LINDSEY GRAHAM. He does a great job 
of chairing that. That is where any 
kind of reform in section 230 should 
come from. 
I agree that the President should 
have the authority to determine troop 
levels. That is what we have in this 
bill. We have the President making 
those decisions. That is why we made 
sure that the final NDAA gave the 
President very broad authority in de-
termining troop levels all around, and 
we have looked at them in Western Eu-
rope and Eastern Europe. We have 
looked at them in Ethiopia—in Afghan-
istan and other places around the 
world. 
So we look at what we have done, 
and I was going to mention—I have 
been down here several times talking 
about the President and what he has 
done and the great job that he has done 
for the United States. And I am going 
to wind up with some comments on a 
card that I put together. I put this card 
together back 2 years ago, talking 
about the top 10 Trump accomplish-
ments. I think it is important that peo-
ple remember that. We have a lot of 
people down here forgetting about all 
the really good things that have hap-
pened, so I am going to talk about that 
in a minute. 
But I am here today because we have 
to pass the NDAA. This would be the 
60th year in a row that we have the 
NDAA, and it is necessary to have. It is 
the most important bill of the year. I 
have believed this for a long time. You 
have heard me say it before. 
I always stand with our troops. The 
military 
servicemembers 
and 
their 
families will suffer if we don’t enact it 
for the 60th year. If the NDAA is not 
passed, more than 200,000 military fam-
ilies will see smaller paychecks in Jan-
uary because the special pays and the 
bonuses for hazard pay are all part of 
this bill. 
Additionally, it would hurt the areas 
where the military is having the most 
serious problem. In a way, it is kind of 
a mixed bag because we have—prior to 
the pandemic coming along, and that 
was in about March of this year—be-
fore that happened, we had the best 
economy, I could argue, that we have 
had in my lifetime, and all these things 
were very, very good. Then, of course, 
when 
that 
happened 
everything 
changed. 
Now, one of the problems you have 
when you have such a great economy is 
that you have a lot of competition. We 
have to have a military force. That 
military force has to have resources. 
They have to have the ability to step 
in because we don’t know where the 
next threat is going to come from. 
And with people with special abili-
ties—now I am talking about pilots, 
cyber experts, engineers, and doctors— 
that is where we have a problem. We 
don’t have enough of them—pilots. I 
have been an active pilot now for 
longer than most Members here have 
been alive, and I know that back dur-
ing the previous administration, the 
Obama administration, we had a real 
serious problem because we were not 
able to attract the pilots at that time 
because that was when we had a Presi-
dent who—he wasn’t ashamed of it—his 
top priority was not defending Amer-
ica. He had other priorities. 
So, consequently, we went through a 
period the last 5 years—the last 5 years 
of his administration were the years 
2010 through 2015, and during that 
timeframe he reduced the funding for 
the military by 25 percent. At the same 
time he did that, China was increasing 
theirs in that same timeframe by 83 
percent. So we have China increasing 
their military expenditures by 83 per-
cent at the same time we are reducing 
ours by 25 percent. So we had serious 
problems there. 
One of the areas, when people are 
cutting the military, that they do it 
where it won’t be as noticeable is in 
the flying hours. So we had pilots out 
there, but they weren’t flying the 
hours that they needed to fly to keep 
their 
proficiency 
up, 
and, 
con-
sequently, a lot of them left and went 
to the airlines and went other places 
because they were wanting to be flying 
the hours. That is one of the problems 
that we had during that time. 
So we have the military’s ability to 
recruit and retain servicemembers who 
are in the shortest supply. As I men-
tioned, that would be things like cyber 
experts and engineers and doctors, so 
they have the skill sets that need to be 
done out there. 
Of course, this President came along, 
and we started rebuilding the military. 
I will always remember being at the 
White House during a time that we 
were talking about what we were going 
to do with the military, and he actu-
ally looked over at me, and he said: 
What do you think we need to do with 
the military? I said: We are going to 
have to rebuild the military. It is going 
to cost something like $750 billion be-
fore it is over. He said: That is what we 
should do; we need to start with that. 
And this President, with his leader-
ship, took us with a new priority in de-
fending America and building our mili-
tary, and it happened. 
So we have the things that will hap-
pen if we don’t pass this thing—the 
education of children for military fam-
ilies. There is a thing called the impact 
aid. Impact aid comes about when you 
don’t get the tax base increase with the 
added enrollment into the schools of 
the children of military families. So 
they have impact because they don’t 
pay the taxes. 
So the impact aid is the amount of 
money that supplements that. It is not 
just in my State of Oklahoma but 
throughout the country. It ensures 
that children of military families re-
ceive 
a 
quality 
education 
by 
supplementing the school districts, the 
budgets, where they are required. 
If the NDAA is not passed, military 
construction projects—I have one in 
my State of Oklahoma that is one that 
would—let’s see; where is that? Yes, we 
have a thing where we have an ammu-
nition depot, a demolition shop, for 
one. This is something where we have 
gone through a lot of BRAC rounds— 
that is Base Realignment and Closure 
Commissions—and we have increased 
the size of our ammunition demolition 
activities substantially. And we are 
doing most of it now right there in 
Oklahoma. Well, this has a new demoli-
tion shop in there so we can get rid of 
a lot of these things we were not able 
to get rid of. 
So we have military construction 
projects in 38 States, and one happens 
to be in the State of Maine. It is very 
significant that they be able to do 
these projects. If the military con-
struction doesn’t happen, both an au-
thorization and appropriation—people 
don’t understand this because it is kind 
of talked around, but in order for some-
thing to get done, you have to have it 
authorized. That is what the com-
mittee that I chair does—authorizes 
the military projects. 
Then it has to be appropriated. The 
appropriators come along, and they put 
the money in there. That is how this 
system works. 
If the NDAA is not passed, the mili-
tary won’t be able to increase the end 
strength—or 
the 
total 
number 
of 
troops in the military services—where

December 29, 2020 
that is needed to address the growing 
threats. End strength increases don’t 
happen without authorization. You 
can’t appropriate it. 
So if the NDAA should not be passed, 
the Pentagon loses the ability to 
quickly and efficiently process security 
clearance investigations. Right now 
there is a backlog because it takes a 
long time to do this, but this has a 
streamlining provision in it that is 
going to make that a lot easier so we 
will be able to get security clearances. 
All these things are tied into this 
bill. The DOD, if we didn’t pass this 
thing, would lack the authority to pay 
the nonmilitary personnel on hospital 
shifts. They are the ones who are doing 
the great job right now with the COVID 
response. 
That is just kind of a snapshot of 
what we are counting on to support our 
troops in the field, the bare minimum 
we need. Without the NDAA, we lose 
all of that and also lose all the other 
policies. 
Right now, this bill makes China the 
primary strategic threat. I think we all 
understand that. We have strategic 
threats from Russia and China. Last 
year, we had the European part ad-
dressed. This year, the bill that is 
pending right now that we are going to 
try to get passed for this year—and I 
think we will successfully do that—is 
going to be concentrating on the Pa-
cific area; that is, China and the things 
that China is doing that people don’t— 
many people don’t realize the threat 
that is out there. 
Right now we are up, as I understand 
it, to seven different areas where the 
Chinese are actually building, creating 
islands in the South China Sea. This is 
something that is different than has 
ever been done before. I contend and 
have always contended it is illegal, but 
they are still doing it. They are doing 
it, and that is the effort that they are 
making there. 
If you go into these islands where 
they are rebuilding, it is almost as if 
China is preparing for World War III— 
all of it. This is what is happening 
right now. 
Right now we know about this 
SolarWinds hack, the hack that we are 
facing. That is something where we 
have language to deal with that in the 
Defense authorization bill. 
The new ‘‘hunt forward’’ authority 
that allows our cyber operators to do 
more work to find malicious actors 
proactively, this is something that we 
need to get done for the defense of our 
country. 
It implements the Cyber Solarium 
Commission and the recommendations. 
There are 27 recommendations that 
they have in this commission. And it 
establishes a new National Cyber Di-
rector. 
These are things where it is a moving 
target. There are a lot of things that 
we are doing now that we should have 
been doing before, and it took China 
and Russia to kind of forge ahead of us, 
as they did in the previous administra-
tion, to remind us that we have these 
very serious problems. Our troops need 
the NDAA. It is our responsibility to 
make sure that they have the equip-
ment, training, and resources to com-
plete the mission and return home 
safely. 
I will close with this one reminder. 
On December 29, 1777, 243 years ago 
today, 
General 
George 
Washington 
wrote to the Continental Congress im-
ploring that they needed to provide the 
resources his troops needed. He wrote: 
I hope that the supplies they will be able 
to furnish in aid of those, which Congress 
may immediately import themselves, will be 
equal and competent to every demand. If 
they do not, I fear—I am satisfied the Troops 
will never be in a situation to answer the 
Public expectation and perform the duties 
required of them. 
That is as true today as it was in 
1777. We have to do that. 
We look at the national security wins 
of this President. I think people don’t 
talk about that as much. We have iden-
tified China as the No. 1 adversary. 
That was in the NDS, the national de-
fense survey. It was put together by 12 
of the real experts—6 Republicans, 6 
Democrats. It has been the blueprint 
for our military ever since that time, 
about 3 years ago. They identified 
China as the major threat. 
There is $2.5 trillion to rebuild the 
military. That is what we were able to 
get done. We increased the size of the 
military, replaced obsolete equipment, 
and made new investments in future 
tech. Hypersonics is a good example. 
Both Russia and China are ahead of us 
in the area of hypersonics; it is the new 
‘‘state of the art.’’ There is a pay raise 
for the troops. 
They took out the terrorist leaders. 
How many people remember Baghdadi 
and Soleimani? They were the top ter-
rorists in the world. They are gone 
now. This President, this administra-
tion took care of that. 
We established the Space Force. The 
Space Force was the first new force 
that was established in many, many 
years. I wasn’t really sold on it at first 
because I thought we were doing a 
pretty good job. It wasn’t coordinated. 
You had different military units doing 
it, and they weren’t even really talking 
to each other. That is what we put to-
gether. This President provided the 
leadership in doing that. 
There is the widow’s tax. Everybody 
remembers that. That was something 
that had to be done. Others talked 
about it. This President did it. 
Then the ISIS caliphate was de-
stroyed. There is the Abraham Ac-
cords. They supported Israel through 
new security assistance. We know that 
is going on today. All these things this 
President has done and has done a 
great job. 
I do want to mention this, and I 
think it is worthwhile, really, because 
we know what won’t happen if we don’t 
pass this bill. We won’t get the bonuses 
necessary; I already mentioned that. 
The impact aid, I mentioned that. Mili-
tary construction project authoriza-
tions, we would not have that. Full pay 
for DOD civilians, that has to be done. 
That has been talked about by a lot of 
administrations but not really done. 
I will finalize this by talking about 
China. Nothing in the bill helps China 
any way at all. There is a group called 
the 
American 
Enterprise 
Institute. 
That is a group that is kind of the con-
servative conscience that evaluates 
programs that come along. They said: 
‘‘This bill has the most substantial and 
consequential China-related provisions 
since the 2000 NDAA.’’ They are talking 
about this bill and what it does for 
China. It establishes the Pacific Deter-
rence. We talked about the European 
Deterrence last year in the NDAA bill. 
This is the Pacific Deterrence. That is 
China we are talking about. It shifts 
the supply chains away from China in 
semiconductors, circuit boards, and 
pharmaceuticals, and it stimulates the 
economy in those ways. It brings Chi-
nese malign national security activi-
ties into light so we know what they 
are doing—who the good guys are, who 
the bad guys are. 
This 
supports 
Taiwan. 
We 
have 
talked about that for a long period of 
time. This bill accelerates that pro-
gram. 
It prevents Chinese intellectual prop-
erty theft. 
I have a whole list here. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this list be inserted after my 
comments. 
What I would like to wind up with, if 
I brought it—I did. Two years ago, I 
put this card together. This is when I 
realized the media hates Trump. Peo-
ple are not aware of all the good things 
he did in those first couple of years. 
People were not aware of it. 
First of all, on the card—I am going 
to run over these. Biggest tax cuts. We 
learned a lesson back there during a 
Democratic administration. John Ken-
nedy said the best way to get more rev-
enue in for the Great Society programs 
that they were advocating at that time 
was to reduce marginal rates and that 
would increase revenue. It did. Unfor-
tunately, John Kennedy died before he 
could reap the benefits that came with 
that, but it worked. Of course, others 
followed 
him, 
including 
Presidents 
Clinton, President Bush, and others, by 
reducing the rates. That also increased 
the revenue. 
What this President did that was dif-
ferent than the rest of them is that he 
did not just decrease the rates—the tax 
rates—but he also decreased all the 
overregulation. 
How many people know that, back 
during the Obama administration, we 
had a rule that we were adhering to 
that said if you were a domestic oil and 
gas producer in the United States of 
America and you were in competition 
with China or somebody else, you had 
to give them our whole playbook on 
how we put together our system over 
here and all the elements. And that put 
us at a disadvantage with our competi-
tors in China and in energy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7964 
December 29, 2020 
I was happy that I used to say, after 
Obama got out of office, that the war 
on fossil fuels was over for a while. 
Look at the energy dominance now. We 
are the global leader in oil and gas pro-
duction: a 277-percent growth in crude 
exports, a 132-percent increase in coal 
exports, a 52-percent increase in nat-
ural gas exports. These are exports. 
That is what we are doing now in the 
United States as a result of the efforts 
of this President and bringing our 
economy around. 
Crackdown on illegal migration. No-
body wanted the wall, they said. Now 
people realize that is where a lot of the 
bad people were getting in. 
We moved the Embassy. Every Demo-
crat and Republican President, in my 
memory, tried to move the U.S. Em-
bassy in Israel to Jerusalem. They all 
talked about it. This President went in 
and did it. 
He enacted the infrastructure bill, 
the WRDA bill, or the Water Resources 
Development Act, and the FAA reau-
thorization. 
And on the judges we have, not just 
Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, but I think 
our number is up to about 225 new 
judges. 
He repealed the overregulation of the 
Dodd-Frank rules. Anyone in business 
will tell you that that was one of the 
major accomplishments of this Presi-
dent, President Trump—and the record 
employment. 
But then I would say that the 10th 
and last one I mention to everyone who 
will listen is what he did for the mili-
tary. We went from the time of drop-
ping down in the last 5 years of the 
Obama administration by 25 percent, 
while China was increasing 83 percent. 
Now we have rebuilt that military. 
That is why the NDAA is so significant 
right now and to make sure that that 
gets passed and that we are able to 
have that. That is what this vote is all 
about. 
The NDAA, or National Defense Au-
thorization Act, is the most important 
bill of the year. That is why we are 
doing it, and that is why we are here 
today during this holiday season. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY WINS 
Identified China as #1 adversary in 2018 
NDS; $2.5 trillion to rebuild military; In-
creased size of military; Replaced obsolete 
equipment; New investments in future tech— 
hypersonics, AI, cyber; 3.1% pay raise—big-
gest in a decade; Took out terrorist leaders 
(Baghdadi, Soleimani); Established Space 
Force; Eliminated widow’s tax; Destroyed 
ISIS caliphate; Historic Abahram Accords; 
Supported Israel through new security as-
sistance; Withdrew from Iran deal; Withdrew 
from INF Treaty; Maximized arms sales; Im-
proved military spouse employment; Res-
cued 55 hostages in 24 countries; Secured $130 
billion in new NATO spending, growing to 
$400 billion by 2024.

f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is an 
unusual sight of a Senator in the Cap-
itol 
between 
Christmas 
and 
New 
Year’s. This is the one time we really 
try to reserve for our personal and fam-
ily responsibilities. Our families, like 
others, look forward to the Christmas 
season. It is the one time of the year 
we desperately try to find ways to 
come together. 
Of course, COVID–19 intervened and 
made that more challenging. But, even 
so, the notion of coming back to Wash-
ington this week and staying, perhaps, 
more than a day to try to finish our 
work is unusual, and the circumstances 
surrounding it are extraordinary, as 
well, not the least of which is the fact 
that we have two bills that have to be 
thought of in the context of our re-
sponsibilities. 
First and foremost is the National 
Defense 
Authorization 
Act. 
This 
month, both the House and the Senate 
passed, with overwhelming bipartisan 
majorities, the fiscal year 2021 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
Senator INHOFE of Oklahoma, a Re-
publican, was on the floor before me. 
He and Senator JACK REED of Rhode Is-
land put in more time than most Mem-
bers can appreciate to make sure that 
this bill really served our military and 
the goal of national security. They 
came up with a good bill, one I was 
proud to support it. 
This annual legislation has been 
signed into law for six consecutive dec-
ades. When the Senate fails to do any-
thing, they always do the National De-
fense Authorization Act. It shows Con-
gress can come together, at least on 
this measure, when it comes to sup-
porting our men and women in uniform 
and keeping our country safe. 
This year, the bill authorized $740.5 
billion in defense spending. It provides 
another 3 percent, well-deserved, pay 
raise for our troops. It also recognizes 
that many in the Armed Forces are on 
the frontlines here at home, as well, 
helping fight the ongoing COVID–19 
epidemic, providing our troops with 
necessary benefits and protections, in-
cluding a 10-percent increase in haz-
ardous duty pay. 
The bill also includes a number of 
provisions that I authored and sup-
ported, including language expressing 
strong support for the Baltic States 
and Ukraine, especially in the face of 
continued, unforgivable Russia aggres-
sion. It requires the renaming of mili-
tary bases in the United States which 
were once named in honor of Confed-
erate generals, those who served in the 
Confederacy in an attempt to secede 
from the Union and to defend the insti-
tution of slavery and have been en-
shrined in the names of these bases for 
many, many years. This effort to re-
name them is long, long overdue. It 
tries to correct and recognize the mis-
takes of our past and really address the 
sensitive racial inequities at the Pen-
tagon when it comes to this decision- 
making. 
It places restrictions on the transfer 
of military equipment to law enforce-
ment agencies. We have to address the 
issue of the militarization of our police 
at a time when we are, frankly, making 
an assessment of the role of police to 
make certain that the overwhelming 
majority of law enforcement officers— 
those who are good, principled, civic- 
minded individuals—is honored and 
that those who fail to meet the test are 
removed from service. 
It expands benefits to our veterans 
who were exposed to Agent Orange dur-
ing the Vietnam war. There are 191,000 
Vietnam-era veterans in my State of 
Illinois. Many of them were exposed to 
toxins, such as Agent Orange, during 
their service and now are paying the 
price. 
It makes it easier for victims of mili-
tary sexual trauma to report instances 
of such crime and expand support for 
survivors. The most recent, horrible in-
cident at Fort Hood was a reminder of 
what we need to do to bring the mili-
tary into the 21st century when it 
comes to respecting the rights of all 
people, men and women. 
It strengthens safeguards against for-
eign cyberattacks. We know how im-
portant that is since the recent revela-
tion confirmed by Secretary of State 
Pompeo that Russia is at work again in 
its attempting to compromise our Fed-
eral agencies, their data, their infor-
mation, and the security secrets that 
they keep for our protection. 
It authorizes funding for PFAS-re-
lated research. If you have never heard 
of the phrase ‘‘PFAS’’ before, I can tell 
you that you are bound to hear it in 
the future. This was used as a flame re-
tardant and in some other capacities 
on many Air Force bases and military 
bases around the United States. We are 
finding that it is still there and is still 
dangerous. We need to put money into 
remediation to help these military in-
stallations, including the Scott Air 
Force Base in Belleville, IL, where 
PFAS was detected earlier this year. 
Still, despite all of the good things in 
this bill and the bipartisanship that 
supported it, President Trump decided 
to veto the bill—one of his rare vetoes. 
He prefers we continue to honor the 
Confederate leaders who committed 
treasonous atrocities in order to pre-
serve slavery. I don’t think that this is 
reflective of the United States of today 
or its values, but that is his position. 
When he was called out for this racist 
inclination, he changed the reason for 
his veto. He claimed the bill didn’t do 
enough to fight China or that we 
should include a measure to address li-
ability issues for tech companies—

never mind that tech company liability 
matters have nothing to do with the 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
He just doesn’t like that there was 
criticism coming down for some of the 
misstatements 
and 
lies 
and 
disinformation he has been spreading 
on social media. 
The President also fails to recognize 
that this Defense authorization bill, in 
fact, does get tough on China. It cre-
ates a new Pacific Deterrence Initia-
tive that puts America back in the seat 
of leadership in that region, where we 
need to be. The Trump administration 
could have started this initiative on its 
own, but it did not, so Congress stepped 
up and created this security partner-
ship because the White House was 
asleep at the wheel. At the end of the 
day, I suppose we can’t expect any-
thing more from a President who has 
denigrated our troops by calling them 
suckers and losers. 
I voted to support the fiscal year 2021 
NDAA. I will support it again to over-
ride this President’s unforgivable and 
reckless veto. I am glad the House did 
so on Monday. I hope we in the Senate 
do the same. Coming back to Wash-
ington was not something I looked for-
ward to this week. I wanted to stay 
home. Yet I knew, when it came to 
funding our troops, I had to be here. 
Many of my colleagues feel the same. I 
hope, tomorrow, we can take that up 
quickly. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there 
was then the drama around the COVID– 
19 relief bill. 
It was hard to describe what we went 
through in the last week to 10 days 
with messages from the White House. I 
wish that the President and those 
around him, advising him, would have 
called to mind the 335,000 Americans 
who have lost their lives due to this 
deadly pandemic and the many more 
who have lost a family member, friend, 
or loved one. In Illinois, we have lost 
16,000 lives to COVID–19—tragic, his-
toric. I extend my deepest condolences 
to the friends and families of those who 
have died or who are fighting this 
virus. Many are my friends. 
More than 121,000 Americans spent 
last night in the hospital—a grim new 
record of hospitalizations as our heroic 
nurses and doctors face unrelenting 
stress from this crisis. I just think, as 
I reflect on the interviews of these men 
and women who are on the frontline of 
healthcare, how stoic they usually are, 
how controlled they usually are, and 
how they are losing it now. With the 
overwhelming numbers they are facing 
and the terrible prospect of someone’s 
dying with a member of the family 
being unable to even enter the room in 
the last minutes of one’s life has got to 
be heartbreaking on a scale that none 
of us can imagine. Think about doing 
that every single day. They have done 
it. I will tell you we will never be able 
to repay them with our gratitude. They 
are true American heroes. 
Many of us returned to Washington 
this week. As I said, we are celebrating 
the holidays in a fashion like never be-
fore with social distancing, Zooms, 
FaceTime, and calls with family and 
loved ones. It is no substitute for the 
kids being there to open their gifts on 
Christmas morning, but it is the re-
ality of what we face today. 
There is some hope on the horizon, 
and though I have been many times 
critical of the Trump administration, I 
do want to give the President credit for 
the Warp Speed Program. It is amaz-
ing, as I read the stories, of what they 
were able to achieve in discovering two 
vaccines that can treat Americans and 
people around the world and keep them 
safe as they face this coronavirus. It 
broke all the records in the discovery 
of these vaccines. As I read about it, I 
continue to be grateful and want to 
make sure America recognizes the doc-
tors, the scientists, and the research-
ers. 
Barney Graham—I didn’t know his 
name until yesterday—came out of a 
story published in the New Yorker. He 
works at the National Institutes of 
Health. He is given a great deal of cred-
it for the breakthrough in the first two 
vaccines that have been approved. 
There are others just like him. I salute 
Dr. Francis Collins, of the National In-
stitutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony 
Fauci, both of whom have become my 
friends over the years—and what a job 
they have done for America. So many 
more deserve recognition, and I hope 
there will be an opportunity to give it 
to them. 
The fact is, these doses of vaccines 
are starting to move across the coun-
try. Last week, Illinois—I am proud to 
say—led the Nation. I congratulated 
our Governor, J.B. Pritzker, yesterday. 
More than 100,000 healthcare workers 
received their first shots last week. I 
asked him why we led, and he said: I 
don’t know. We just put together our 
own program of distribution, and it 
worked. Thank goodness it did. Lives 
will be saved because of it, but there is 
so much more to do. 
Progress in administering the vac-
cine has been slow as we still struggle 
to reach the hardest hit areas. The rosy 
projections from the administration 
have not come to fruition yet, but the 
fact is, we have two viable vaccines. 
That is miraculous. I look forward to 
the new administration’s—the Biden 
administration’s—new management in 
this effort, and I am glad Congress 
came together to pass a relief bill that 
included $30 billion for vaccine develop-
ment and distribution. 
When the President said he wasn’t 
going to sign this bill, I thought: How 
can he say that? He should be taking 
credit, rightfully, for the Warp Speed 
Program and his role in seeing that 
program move forward instead of com-
plicating the distribution of the vac-
cines by threatening to veto the bill. 
Fortunately, for us, in the end, he 
signed the bill. 
On Sunday evening, the President 
signed the bipartisan annual spending 
bill and the COVID–19 relief bill. There 
were complaints about the size of the 
bill. Well, the entire Federal budget 
was included in that bill, as well as the 
COVID–19 relief undertaking, as well as 
many other bills, such as the Water Re-
sources Development Act. All of these 
are major pieces of legislation, and 
they were combined in one bill that 
went way beyond 5,000 pages. 
Unfortunately, the President delayed 
in signing the bill and created needless 
uncertainty in America, particularly 
among the unemployed and others who 
are suffering from this public health 
and economic crisis. This agreement 
provides 
much 
needed 
support 
for 
many of them, but they will have some 
delay in receiving their checks because 
of the President’s period of indecision. 
Enhanced unemployment benefits of 
$300 a week and an extension of the un-
employment program, created under 
the CARES Act, through March 14 will 
bring more relief to many millions of 
families. 
Possibly the largest single item in 
the COVID relief bill—$325 billion— 
went to provide our Nation’s ailing 
small businesses another chance at sur-
vival. The Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram worked in the initial CARES Act, 
and it was renewed in this under-
taking. 
An extension of the Federal eviction 
moratorium through January 2021, cou-
pled with $25 billion in emergency rent-
al assistance, will literally mean that 
people will not be evicted right after 
Christmas. Approximately, $850 million 
is going to Illinois to help keep fami-
lies in their homes during this pan-
demic. 
The 15-percent increase in nutrition 
assistance is certainly needed. It goes 
through the SNAP program, which was 
historically known as food stamps, to 
make sure that families have some-
thing on the table. I can tell you that 
I woke up this morning in Springfield, 
IL, to look at the front page of the 
newspaper and learn that an anony-
mous donor had given our local food 
bank $500,000. The people at the food 
bank were, of course, appreciative and 
said they desperately needed it in my 
hometown and towns all across Amer-
ica. This increase in food stamp assist-
ance is long overdue, and I am glad it 
was included. 
The bill includes a number of impor-
tant measures, but we have to go to 
work to make sure that we deal with 
the sharp turn of an emergency re-
sponse to this bill and do more. We ad-
dress the needs required to respond to 
this pandemic immediately, but more 
will follow. It was a tough negotiation 
and an honest compromise, and I was 
happy to be part of a bipartisan group 
of Senators who may have gotten the 
ball rolling—at least we think we did— 
in order to hand it over to the leaders 
to finish the job. I think what we have 
achieved, on a bipartisan basis, was 
largely included in the final bill, and it 
addressed the major elements that 
were necessary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7966 
December 29, 2020 
One of the most important items 
that Congress failed to reach agree-
ment on was funding for State and 
local governments. States and local-
ities are struggling with increased 
costs and decreased revenues due to the 
pandemic. By this summer, my home 
State of Illinois will have lost more 
than $5 billion in revenues. I can tell 
you that this is going to cause pain and 
cutbacks. This is not money that was 
lost in our pension system, which has 
its own share of troubles; it is money 
that was directly attributable to the 
downturn in revenues because of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. It isn’t just hap-
pening in Illinois; it is happening all 
around the country—in red and blue 
States. Our neighboring State of Ken-
tucky, to the south of us, is facing the 
same hardships we are. 
Federal funding for States and local-
ities needs to be done for our great cit-
ies and great States that are strug-
gling, and I certainly hope that the 
next President, when he is sworn in on 
January 20, will take this up as one of 
his highest priorities. Our Nation’s eco-
nomic recovery is slowed down by 
budget cuts that will be necessary in 
States and localities because of this 
cutback in revenues. 
Now, 
the 
most 
widely 
discussed 
measure of the COVID–19 relief bill is a 
second round of economic impact pay-
ments. Just yesterday, the House of 
Representatives passed the CASH Act, 
which is a measure that would increase 
the direct payments to individuals— 
adults and children—from $600 to $2,000 
for those who earn less than $75,000 a 
year. The measure passed in the House 
by a vote of 275 to 174. Over the past 
several months, we have heard time 
and again from economists that we run 
the risk of doing too little, which far 
outweighs the risk of doing too much 
when it comes to this economic recov-
ery. 
The head of the Federal Reserve, 
Chairman Powell, has really instructed 
us to keep the foot on the accelerator 
so that our economy doesn’t slump 
into a recession. At a time when so 
many American families are laid off, 
unemployed, and simply struggling to 
get by, there is nothing more invig-
orating to the economy than to have a 
cash infusion. Those with limited re-
sources who are battling to pay bills 
turn around and spend that money 
quickly. They don’t salt it away for 
some future rainy day. They need it 
now. That is why we should seriously 
consider this. 
By passing this enhanced measure, 
we can restore the American public’s 
confidence in Washington and by the 
fact that we are listening and working 
together, on a bipartisan basis, to re-
spond. This measure that passed the 
House of Representatives has the sup-
port of the President, Speaker PELOSI, 
House Democrats, as well as many 
House Republicans. Leader SCHUMER 
and my Senate Democratic colleagues 
support it. So I hope Senator MCCON-
NELL—the Republican leader—and his 
colleagues in the Republican caucus 
will join us and allow us to pass this 
bill quickly this week. Let’s step up to 
the plate and get this done. The Amer-
ican people have waited too long for 
this relief. 
I, for one, am proud of my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for coming to-
gether and passing a meaningful relief 
bill, but the time for patting one an-
other on the back is over. Let’s finish 
the job. Let’s make sure that we have 
this authorization bill for the Depart-
ment of Defense and that we come to 
the rescue of our families across Amer-
ica who need defense against the vagar-
ies of this pandemic and this economy. 
We can finally see a slight glimmer of 
light at the end of this tunnel. If we 
want to address the needs of Americans 
in crisis, it starts with passing this leg-
islation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
COMPETITIVE HEALTH INSURANCE 
REFORM ACT 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about my bipartisan 
legislation, the Competitive Health In-
surance Reform Act, which I intro-
duced with my colleague Senator PAT-
RICK LEAHY. This is important legisla-
tion that will protect consumers from 
anticompetitive practices by repealing 
the outdated antitrust exemption for 
the health insurance industry. This bill 
has wide bipartisan support, as well as 
a strong history of near-unanimous 
congressional consensus, having passed 
the House of Representatives three 
times, most recently this September. 
In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled in 
United States v. South-Eastern Under-
writers that the business of insurance 
was a form of interstate commerce. 
This meant that the health insurance 
industry would be subject to Federal 
antitrust laws under the Commerce 
Clause of the Constitution. The insur-
ance industry began raising uncertain-
ties about whether this meant that 
States would no longer have authority 
to regulate insurance. When Congress 
acted to reaffirm this State authority, 
in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the in-
surance industry managed to add a 
last-minute special-interest loophole 
that exempted the business of insur-
ance from Federal antitrust laws. 
It has become clear that this anti-
quated exemption has effectively given 
insurance companies the power to 
collude to drive up prices, restrict com-
petition, and deny consumers choice. 
The large health insurance companies 
of today have taken advantage of this 
exemption to abuse the market and ar-
tificially inflate healthcare costs. As a 
result, consumers are paying higher 
prices to get basic healthcare services, 
which couldn’t be a worse outcome in 
the middle of a major pandemic. 
I recognize concerns have been raised 
about whether this legislation might 
impair or create uncertainty regarding 
the authority of State insurance regu-
lators. I appreciate hearing from all 
stakeholders and wish to put those 
concerns to rest by making clear the 
intent and scope of the bill. This legis-
lation merely amends a peripheral pro-
vision of the McCarran-Ferguson Act 
containing an antiquated exemption 
from Federal antitrust laws as it ap-
plies to health insurance companies. It 
does not in any way interfere with, su-
persede, or abrogate the authority pro-
vided and guaranteed by the McCarran- 
Ferguson Act to State insurance regu-
lators to regulate the health insurance 
industry. 
This legislation would ensure that 
health insurance companies would be 
subject to Federal antitrust laws in the 
same way as the rest of the American 
economy, including other regulated 
sectors. Most importantly, as this bill 
does not disturb any of the authority 
provided to State insurance regulators 
under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, it 
does not empower Federal authorities 
to interfere with, supersede, or prevent 
states from regulating the health in-
surance industry however they see fit. 
Simply put, this legislation would 
give the Department of Justice and the 
Federal Trade Commission authority 
to apply antitrust laws to anticompeti-
tive practices in the health insurance 
industry. Furthermore, it is the intent 
of the authors of this legislation that 
the DOJ and FTC notify and work with 
states on investigations they have re-
ceived or are undertaking that involve 
health insurance entities in their state. 
The Competitive Health Insurance 
Reform Act will restore full trans-
parency, promote oversight, and en-
courage competition within the health 
insurance industry. I look forward to 
this legislation being signed into law 
by the President. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate Senator DAINES joining me to 
clarify the intent of the Competitive 
Health Insurance Reform Act of 2019. 
This legislation, which Senator DAINES 
has introduced with Senator LEAHY, 
would modify the McCarran-Ferguson 
Act by eliminating the health insur-
ance industry’s exemption from Fed-
eral antitrust laws. That sounds like a 
good idea, but it has implications for 
longstanding State regulation of the 
insurance industry. 
States have had the primary respon-
sibility for the regulation of health in-
surance since the 1940s. Given my past 
experience as commissioner of Maine’s 
Department of Professional and Finan-
cial Regulation, I know firsthand that 
State insurance regulators do a good 
job of responding to the needs and con-
cerns of their insurance consumers. To 
protect consumers, State insurance

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7967 
December 29, 2020 
regulators hold probing hearings on 
rate requests which often lead to lower 
rates being approved. Most State insur-
ance regulators have consumer protec-
tion advocates who resolve disputes be-
tween insurers and individual con-
sumers. State regulators do not tol-
erate unfair or anticompetitive prac-
tices. As the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners wrote to the 
leaders of the Senate and the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, ‘‘The potential 
for bid rigging, price-fixing and market 
allocation is of great concern to state 
insurance regulators and we share your 
view that such practices would be 
harmful to consumers and should not 
be tolerated. However, we want to as-
sure you that these activities are not 
permitted under state law. Indeed, the 
state insurance regulators in all states 
actively enforce their antitrust rules 
and review rates to ensure they are ac-
tuarially justified, sufficient for sol-
vency and nondiscriminatory.’’ 
Based on this experience, I have con-
sistently raised concerns about legisla-
tion that could interfere with the cur-
rent State-level regulation of insur-
ance and could ultimately harm Maine 
consumers and smaller insurers. These 
concerns extend to the Competitive 
Health Insurance Reform Act. 
While the bill does not directly mod-
ify the portion of McCarran-Ferguson 
that affirms State regulatory author-
ity, it, however, does add a layer of 
Federal review, and we need to ensure 
that in doing so we do not create in-
creased confusion, cost, and possible 
conflicts between State and Federal ef-
forts. 
This is why it is very important to 
make clear Congress’s intent that 
along with the changes specified in the 
bill, it is Congress’s expectation that 
the Department of Justice and the Fed-
eral Trade Commission must notify 
State bureaus of insurance and attor-
neys general of any complaints or in-
vestigations they have received or are 
performing that involve entities in 
their 
state. 
I 
appreciate 
Senator 
DAINES’ willingness to join me today to 
ensure this intent is clearly stated in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
Given the agreement to provide for-
mal clarification of the expectation 
that DOJ and FTC shall provide notifi-
cation to States regarding complaints 
or investigations they have received or 
are performing, I will withdraw my ob-
jection to passage of this legislation. 
Thank you. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF ERIC J. SOSKIN 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, for over 
40 years, inspectors general have acted 
as independent, nonpartisan watchdogs 
tasked with preventing and uncovering 
fraud, waste, and abuse in the Federal 
Government. Simply put, inspectors 
general make sure government is doing 
what it’s supposed to do. To accom-
plish this immense task, inspectors 
general must be experienced in over-
sight, trusted by both political parties, 
and ready to hit the ground running on 
any audits, investigations, and other 
reviews of their agencies. 
Unfortunately, the nominee for in-
spector general that we considered last 
week does not meet this basic test. 
The Department of Transportation is 
charged with ensuring that America 
has the safest, most efficient and mod-
ern 
transportation 
system 
in 
the 
world, so that Americans are able to 
travel safely and efficiently by road, 
rail, or air. The Department has an an-
nual budget of over $87 billion and em-
ploys over 55,000 personnel, with a foot-
print in every State. 
The DOT inspector general must be 
ready to oversee the full range of these 
activities, from every dollar that funds 
our highways to every safety decision 
issued by DOT regulators. To meet this 
task, the office employs over 400 per-
sonnel, with an annual budget of over 
$94 million. 
Eric Soskin, the nominee for DOT in-
spector general, is not qualified to 
oversee an agency of this size and 
scope, or to lead the activities of one of 
the largest Offices of Inspector General 
in the Federal Government. Mr. Soskin 
does not have any experience managing 
large 
organizations. 
He 
has 
never 
worked in an Office of Inspector Gen-
eral, and he does not have experience 
in many of the basic activities of such 
an office, like audits or inspections. Al-
though he has legal experience, he has 
not focused on DOT or transportation 
issues at any point in his career. 
While I appreciate Mr. Soskin’s serv-
ice at the Department of Justice and 
his enthusiasm for the position, he 
simply lacks the qualifications to en-
sure DOT is fulfilling its responsibil-
ities. 
I am most troubled, however, by the 
increasing politicization of inspectors 
general by the President and by the 
majority. 
Since 1981, this body has confirmed 
over 150 inspectors general; until last 
week, all but two of these nominees 
had been confirmed by unanimous con-
sent, a voice vote, or a unanimous 
vote. The reason for this is simple: To 
do their jobs, inspectors general must 
be trusted by each member of Congress 
and by every American, regardless of 
political party. 
Until this Congress, when an inspec-
tor general has faced significant oppo-
sition, 
the 
Senate 
either 
worked 
through any concerns or declined to 
advance the nomination. The majority 
did not force through partisan or un-
qualified nominees. That is how we 
have upheld this institution. That is 
how we have maintained trust in the 
independence, qualifications, and in-
tegrity of inspectors general. 
This Congress, we held our first 
party-line vote in 40 years to confirm a 
deeply 
partisan 
inspector 
general 
nominee. We have now confirmed yet 
another inspector general on a party- 
line vote during a lameduck session, 
with a nominee who was already re-
jected by nearly half of the Commerce 
Committee and as well as on the Sen-
ate floor. 
The inspector general is a position 
that continues across administrations. 
It is one with tremendous authority to 
look at every agency record, to inter-
view any employee, and to carry out 
criminal investigations. We cannot 
transform this institution into one of 
Democratic inspectors general and Re-
publican inspectors general. This is not 
and cannot become a political position. 
Inspectors General hold government 
accountable to the law and to the 
American people. And it is our respon-
sibility to protect this institution and 
reject any nomination that will under-
mine their independent, nonpartisan 
work.
