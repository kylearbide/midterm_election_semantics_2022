PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God of the ages, on this day we come 
before You, celebrating this month the 
history of our Black American ances-
tors, who have lived lives of faith, and 
on whose backs were built the founda-
tions of this country, and who labor 
still for justice. Before Your throne we 
lift up for Your blessing countless un-
sung heroes who in faith gave You 
their own offerings of life and love, 
whose unwavering faith and fortitude 
have pleased You. And who, when 
called, even through unimaginable ad-
versity, continued to journey in faith, 
certain of their inheritance of Your 
promise. 
Therefore, since we are surrounded 
by such a great cloud of witnesses, may 
our lives be shaped by their testimony. 
Let us throw off everything that 
hinders and the sin that so easily en-
tangles that we would not allow any-
thing to deter us from serving You in 
faith. 
And may we run with perseverance 
the race marked out for us, together, 
toward the goal that You have or-
dained, that as one people we would 
serve both this Nation and Your pur-
pose. 
In our diversity, in our unity, we 
offer ourselves to You as we pray in the 
strength of Your holy name. 
Amen.

The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You are the light that 
keeps us safe. Your protections soothe 
doubts and calm fears. You hear our 
prayers, and Your answers are swift. 
Lord, teach our lawmakers to follow 
Your guidance. Place their feet on the 
right paths. Guide them with Your pre-
cepts and encourage them with Your 
promises. May their faith in You keep 
them courageous and true. 
Lord, we praise You for You are the 
rock of our salvation. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak in morn-
ing business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL 
GUARD 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as 
you know, as you walk around the Cap-
itol these last couple of weeks, you 
have to notice the changes. Quiet views 
of the Capitol, the seat of our govern-
ment, are obstructed by fences topped 
with barbed wire and servicemembers 
on patrol at every corner, every en-
trance, and every gateway. These serv-
icemembers, men and women of our 
National Guard, are our neighbors. 
They are our coworkers. They are 
members of our family. They are called 
away from home, many of which volun-
teered to come here to the Nation’s 
Capitol to protect the very heart of de-
mocracy. They deserve our thanks. 
They deserve our gratitude. They de-
serve our unwavering support. 
With over 25,000 members of the 
Guard from every State, territory, and 
District of Columbia present in Wash-
ington to protect our time-honored tra-
ditions, there is no greater representa-
tion of the best of America here as we 
carry out the people’s business. I am 
grateful to them for their service. 
Now, 2 weeks ago, I had the pleasure 
of visiting and thanking some members 
of Vermont’s own National Guard— 
Lieutenant Colonel Day, along with 
Captain 
Lahr, 
and 
First 
Sergeant 
Stewart 
from 
Bravo 
Troop 
of 
Vermont’s renowned Mountain Calvary 
Battalion. They welcomed me and in-
troduced me to a contingent of the 
Vermonters present. 
Now, through their deployment, they 
are asked to face challenges at a mo-
ment’s notice. They use the training 
and the teamwork that has always 
helped them succeed in Vermont and 
overseas. They met those challenges, 
and they exceeded those challenges. 
Like all National Guard units when 
they deploy, these Vermonters came to 
the District with deep ties back to our 
communities and the families and em-
ployers that make their service pos-
sible. 
I am privileged to be the cochair of 
the Senate National Guard Caucus. I 
have heard, time and again, firsthand 
testimony from members of the Guard 
that that hometown connection is the 
glue that makes what they do possible. 
We are grateful to their families, their 
communities, and their employers too. 
But that can be said about every Sen-
ator here, including our distinguished 
Presiding Officer. 
The 
Vermont 
Guard 
members 
I 
talked to carried with them the sup-
port of Vermont communities, espe-
cially from Southern Vermont, where 
Bravo Troop’s armory is located. To 
give you an idea of how they are part 
of the community, the deployment was 
led by the vice principal of Brattleboro 
Union High School. It included the 
cousin of one of my staffers. It was 
filled with soldiers with connections 
and stories that make up the culture 
and community I proudly call home— 
Vermont. A similar story could be told 
about the communities represented in 
the units from every State and terri-
tory. I am especially grateful because 
most of the soldiers from Vermont are 
going to deploy overseas later this 
year. Everyone that came down this 
January volunteered to be here. 
So much has been asked of the Na-
tional Guard these last 3 months, from 
the COVID–19 response to several dis-
turbances 
this 
summer, 
to 
safe-
guarding the Nation’s Capitol—all of it 
on top of regular training and deploy-
ment schedules. 
To the men and women of the Na-
tional Guard from every State and ter-
ritory and the District of Columbia, we 
appreciate the immense contributions 
you have made to our country today 
and every day. You are real patriots. 
You are real heroes, and democracy 
thanks you. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on 
another matter to bring to our leaders, 
you know, I first came to this Capitol 
when I was a teenager with my parents. 
We came down from Vermont. I re-
member looking around and walking 
through it, thinking what a privilege it 
was just to walk here. And then, during 
my years at Georgetown Law School, I 
would come here often just to see it, 
just to watch it, and to walk up the 
Mall and look at the Capitol and say: 
That is democracy. 
I never thought I would work here, 
but I have now for a number of years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S208 
February 1, 2021 
I found the assault on and the defile-
ment of the U.S. Capitol mere weeks 
ago was an attack on the bedrock of 
our democratic institutions right here 
in the citadel of our democracy. 
The toll that this insurrection has 
taken and will take on our great Na-
tion will be felt for so long. In addition 
to the physical damage done, there is a 
human toll that this attack has taken 
on the lives lost and the injuries suf-
fered by so many brave officers of the 
Capitol Police. 
I was both in this Chamber and in the 
House Chamber during the time this 
attack unfolded. The next morning, I 
recorded some of the lingering physical 
damage to this building in several pho-
tographs that I made. 
But the attack also is about things 
you can’t photograph, the unseen scars 
in the Capitol community—the staff 
members and the Capitol employees 
who work every day to help make our 
Capitol Building function as it needs to 
function. Most Members of Congress 
were also roiled by this attack. It has 
shaken all of us. 
Chad Pergram of FOX News has writ-
ten an essay that captures this heavy 
toll on the people who work in the Cap-
itol. I was so moved when I read his 
essay. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
the essay by Chad Pergram written on 
January 31, 2021. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Fox News, Jan. 31, 2021] 
THE SPEAKER’S LOBBY: SCARS 
(BY CHAD PERGRAM) 
I know of U.S. Capitol Police officers who 
are hurting. Smarting. Reeling. 
This, nearly a month after the insurrection 
at the Capitol they are paid to protect. 
I know of Congressional aides who are 
hurting. Smarting. Reeling. 
This, after a violent mob shattered win-
dows and jimmied doors, storming through 
the Capitol in which they work. 
And these are the aides who weren’t at the 
Capitol on January 6. 
These were staffers working from home 
during the pandemic. They’re still upset 
after seeing an insurrection of the highest 
order in their workplace. 
And then there are the aides who were 
working at the Capitol on 1/6. 
I know these aides are hurting. Smarting. 
Reeling. 
They huddled for hours under desks. In a 
coat closets. In restrooms. Barricaded, in 
rooms, just as they were taught in a post- 
Columbine world. 
This, as the violent horde marauded 
through Congressional offices and deployed 
Trump flagpoles like battering rams to 
break into the Speaker’s Lobby off the House 
chamber. 
These are the scars which will take time to 
heal. 
But they are scars. 
And scars never disappear. 
The United States Capitol bears ugly scars 
of that mortifying day. The lesions which re-
main are the hideous fencing encapsulating 
the Capitol, draped with spirals of concertina 
wire. There are the National Guard troops in 
fatigues, toting M5 carbines, guarding the 
American Capitol. 
But the scars will remain in heads and 
hearts long after the troops depart. 
An unsettling silence cloaks you once you 
enter the Capitol’s secure perimeter these 
days. You pass through the fencing, showing 
your pass a few times as you walk. You pass 
stretches of grass which is the Russell Sen-
ate Park. 
It is a park in name only. 
The grass is there. Some frost in winter. 
Benches. The Robert A. Taft Memorial and 
Carillon, honoring the late Senate Majority 
Leader. 
But you can’t really get there. You cross 
Constitution Avenue. A car, like yours, al-
ready cleared for the ‘‘Green Zone,’’ may 
trundle by. 
There is no bustle. 
Capitol Hill was always a hive of activity. 
AidesTouristsLobbyistsSightseersSenato-
rsJournalistsGawkersJoggersToddl-
ersPoliceOfficers. 
Before the pandemic, a jumble of human-
ity. Just coming and going. Doing the na-
tion’s business. Senators rushing to the Sen-
ate chamber to confirm the Assistant Inte-
rior Secretary. Or maybe a family just in 
from Spokane who’ve never set foot in DC, 
pushing a three-year-olds’ stroller, ambling 
around the grounds. Lobbyists piling out of 
cabs on Independence Avenue in front of the 
Longworth House Office Building. 
Now, a stillness. 
The pandemic hushed the daily bedlam of 
Capitol Hill. 
Lawmakers may only show up to vote. And 
on the House side, some don’t even do that, 
voting from home. There are aides who 
haven’t darkened the door in close to a year. 
There might be a smattering of tourists. 
Some joggers. Dog walkers. 
A funereal silence. 
That silence is incongruous with the 
quotidian scramble of Capitol Hill. The Cap-
itol and its environs are a shell of what they 
once were. 
The white marble is still there. The maj-
esty of the Dome remains. But that silence is 
haunting. The silence is a signal. 
It tells you something bad happened here. 
I’ve been back at the Capitol most days 
since the riot. I stayed at a hotel close to the 
Capitol around the inauguration—so I could 
easily get in and out for work. My wife drove 
me in the other days and dropped me off. If 
the Capitol were locked down like this in 
any other circumstance, I would likely hire 
an Uber, Lyft or take Metro. But the pan-
demic presents a new level of difficulty just 
getting to work and parking my car. 
But I drove myself to the Capitol one day 
last week. Officers inspected my badge and 
checked my trunk on multiple occasions— 
twice after I got inside the Green Zone. 
There was a lot of confusion about which 
way to go and where you were supposed to 
drive. But after a while, I finally parked 
where I usually do. There were no other cars 
there. 
And then there was the silence. Just the 
rustle of shriveled leaves, clinging to the 
trees, bombed by tiny ice pellets from the 
sky. 
No horns. No cars. No people. 
The silence is one of those scars. 
Some who work on Capitol Hill may never 
return, traumatized by 1/6. 
That’s a scar, too. 
And, there’s likely an emerging scar. 
The Capitol won’t be the same. 
Multiple investigations are now underway 
as to what went wrong at the Capitol on 1/6. 
But one of the most consequential lines 
came from Acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief 
Yogananda Pittman. Pittman briefed House 
Appropriators about the attack last week. 
‘‘In my experience, I do not believe there 
(were) any preparations that would have al-
lowed for an open campus in which lawful 
protesters could exercise their First Amend-
ment right to free speech, and, at the same 
time, prevent the attack on the (Capitol) 
grounds that day,’’ said Pittman. 
Yes. There will be discussions about per-
sonnel, better communications and barri-
cades. Many reporters picked up on what 
Pittman said about no ‘‘preparations’’ fail-
ing to avert ‘‘the attack.’’ 
But there’s another important line from 
Pittman. She use the phrase ‘‘open campus.’’ 
That is what the U.S. Capitol complex gen-
erally was. An open campus. And, it remains 
to be seen if it ever will be again. 
Prior to 1/6, people could traipse about the 
campus at their leisure. Walk across the 
Capitol plaza. Pre-pandemic, people could 
clear security and spend all day wandering 
around the House and Senate office build-
ings, if they so chose. It didn’t matter if they 
had an appointment to see someone or not. 
The Capitol itself was closed unless you 
were there on official business. You could 
also come to the Capitol to watch the House 
and Senate in action from the galleries. 
The difference between the Capitol, and 
say, the State Department, is that the public 
doesn’t have the right to just show up at an 
executive branch building and waltz around. 
Even the perimeter. But access to the Cap-
itol is quintessentially Congressional. It’s a 
two-way exchange on Capitol Hill. The peo-
ple demand to interact with the people who 
represent them in Washington. And, law-
makers insist that their constituents have 
access to them. It’s one of the only ways 
American democracy functions. 
Moreover, lawmakers want people to enjoy 
the grounds. The view from the Capitol Hill 
vista, looking westward toward the Wash-
ington Monument and Lincoln Memorial is 
one of the most dramatic in the world. 
Openness made the Capitol unique. It also 
made it an incredibly soft target—nearly two 
decades after 9/11. 
So how does Congress address this? Barri-
cades? Appointments? No one on the grounds 
unless they’ve cleared security blocks away? 
Controlled access? The closures of Constitu-
tion and Independence Avenues? 
They hardened the White House facility in 
the early 1980s after the West Berlin dis-
cotheque bombing. They shuttered Pennsyl-
vania Avenue in front of the White House 
after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. That 
also forced Congressional officials to shut off 
many streets which run between the House 
and Senate office buildings. 
So what scars will the Capitol now bear 
now? 
The Capitol will be different. More re-
stricted. Less access. 
And the quiet serves as a reminder to the 
bedlam on January 6. 
Mr. 
LEAHY.

that, 
Madam 
President, I suggest the absence of a

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
President Biden built his campaign for 
the Presidency around a theme of 
unity, the promise that he would work 
to heal the deep divisions that exist in 
our country and restore respect and bi-
partisan communication. He has con-
sistently pointed to his decades in the 
U.S. Senate as proof of his under-
standing and his ability to achieve re-
sults—and for good reason. Senator 
Biden had a record of working across 
the aisle and brokering bipartisan 
deals, but so far, at least, the actions 
of President Biden have run counter to 
his image as a pragmatic dealmaker. 
Let’s look at the first big test, which 
is coronavirus relief. This, of course, 
has been the main focus of the Senate 
for nearly a year now. We passed sev-
eral bipartisan bills, ranging from far- 
reaching, multitrillion-dollar packages 
to smaller, more targeted bills, and 
every 
single 
one 
received 
over-
whelming bipartisan support. Make no 
mistake, the path to getting those bills 
signed into law was not easy. The Re-
publican-controlled Senate and the 
Democratic-controlled House had very 
different ideas about the size and shape 
of those bills, but we managed to over-
come those differences and provide tril-
lions of dollars in relief to support our 
response on both the healthcare and 
economic fronts. 
President Biden has made COVID re-
lief a top priority and laid out a frame-
work for a $1.9 trillion coronavirus re-
lief package, which includes everything 
from bipartisan priorities, like funding 
for vaccines, to partisan ones, like 
slush funds for blue States. 
I don’t support the President’s pro-
posal in its current form, but I do be-
lieve that it is a good place to start to 
kick off bipartisan negotiations. I also 
believe that before we rush out and 
throw trillions of dollars—I should say 
more dollars—at this problem, we need 
to see how what we have done is al-
ready working. In fact, it was only a 
month ago when we passed our last 
COVID–19 relief bill with big bipartisan 
votes, and that money is not even out 
the door yet. 
As we look to the future, I had high 
hopes that we could continue this 
trend of working together. After all, 
that is the idea the President ran on— 
bipartisanship, deal making, and reach-
ing across the aisle to build consensus. 
President Biden knows the rough and 
tumble of the legislative process very 
well. He helped broker many com-
promises during his career and prom-
ised to use that experience to restore 
bipartisanship in Washington. But that 
is not what the early days of this ad-
ministration have looked like, not 
even close. 
Our Democratic colleagues kicked off 
the year with threats to eliminate the 
filibuster. We know the filibuster is the 
single biggest safeguard of the minor-
ity in the Senate, whether it be Repub-
lican or Democrat, because it re-
quires—indeed, 
it 
forces—bipartisan 
compromise in order to advance legis-
lation. 
For the past 6 years, as the minority 
party, our Democratic colleagues have 
proudly filibustered bill after bill. 
They have blocked the Senate from 
considering legislation on everything 
from coronavirus to justice reform, to 
border security. 
Make no mistake, Republicans were 
frustrated. It is frustrating to have the 
majority and not be able to get what 
you want. But the integrity of the fili-
buster and its ultimate purpose was 
never called into question, even though 
Leader MCCONNELL
faced calls from 
many—including President Trump—to 
toss it out the window. 
But in this new reality of a 50–50 Sen-
ate, the Democratic leader has so far 
not been interested in playing by the 
existing rules. He wants an easy, com-
promised-free path for the Democratic 
radical agenda, and he is prepared to go 
full-scorched earth to make it happen. 
Senator SCHUMER has threatened to 
eliminate the legislative filibuster and 
subject the country to the chaos that a 
majority-ruled Senate would create. 
The difference here, of course, is that 
Leader MCCONNELL stood up to those in 
his own party who called for this. Sen-
ator SCHUMER so far has led us to be-
lieve that he will not do the same. 
Fortunately, the Senators from West 
Virginia 
and 
Arizona, 
Senators 
MANCHIN and SINEMA, have vowed not 
to participate in this dangerous exer-
cise. And it is clear—or it should be 
clear, but I will emphasize—that this is 
not for the benefit of the minority 
party. This is for the benefit of the 
Senate as an institution and the coun-
try as a whole. 
With the elimination of the filibuster 
off the table, because at least two 
Democratic Senators will not vote to 
eliminate it, Senate Democrats have 
found a new opportunity to break the 
rules, ignore precedent, and pave a 
path for partisan legislation. If the re-
ports can be believed, our Democratic 
colleagues are preparing to abuse the 
budget reconciliation process to ram 
President Biden’s coronavirus relief 
proposal through the Senate. This is a 
process designed as a way to enact cer-
tain fiscal policies in a budget resolu-
tion—things like spending reductions, 
tax relief, or tax increases. 
Unlike the traditional legislative 
process, which is used for the majority 
of the bills that move through the Sen-
ate, there is no 60-vote threshold when 
you use budget reconciliation. But that 
doesn’t mean you can or you should 
fast-track partisan legislation. In fact, 
our 
predecessors 
have 
warned 
us 
against that. 
One of the most influential Senators 
in protecting this budget reconcili-
ation process was Robert C. Byrd, the 
longtime Senator from West Virginia. 
He was the architect of the now so- 
called Byrd rule, which is used to keep 
the reconciliation process from being 
used to circumvent the normal legisla-
tive process. In short, he wanted to 
prevent the process from being abused 
in the way Democrats appear to be pre-
paring for now. 
The referee in all of this is the Sen-
ate Parliamentarian, a nonpartisan ex-
pert adviser on Senate rules and proce-
dure. Folks on both sides of the aisle 
know and respect our Parliamentarian 
and the people who work with her. We 
respect their guidance to understand 
the rules of the Senate and ensure that 
both sides are treated fairly. 
The most senior Member of this 
Chamber, the President pro tempore, 
once said: 
I’ve been here with many, many parlia-
mentarians. All were good. But she’s the 
best. 
Throughout modern history, Senate 
Parliamentarians 
have 
advised 
the 
Senate on which provisions can and 
cannot be included in a budget rec-
onciliation bill based on the applica-
tion of the Byrd rule. In fact, the Par-
liamentarian gives it a process known 
as ‘‘a Byrd bath.’’ 
While the majority party technically 
has the power to determine whether or 
not to accept the Parliamentarian’s ad-
vice, there has never been much of a 
question about whether to do so or not. 
Think about this. It would be like al-
lowing a batter in the World Series to 
ignore the umpire’s balls-and-strikes 
call and treat every pitch as if it were 
a ball. I am sure it is no surprise, then, 
that the last time either party ignored 
the Parliamentarian’s ruling was 1975— 
nearly 50 years ago. Since then, both 
Republicans and Democrats have un-
derstood the dangers of such reckless 
action and have respected the advice of 
the Parliamentarian, even when it 
punches a hole in their own legislation. 
But if reports are to be believed, it 
looks like our Democratic colleagues 
may be preparing to break precedent 
once again. With the filibuster—legis-
lative 
filibuster—still 
intact, 
our 
Democratic colleagues are no doubt 
considering a plan to shove President 
Biden’s massive coronavirus relief bill 
through the Senate using reconcili-
ation, and that plan involves ignoring

February 1, 2021 
any adverse rulings from the Parlia-
mentarian. Over the last several dec-
ades, Senators on both sides have re-
frained from such a dangerous move be-
cause of the precedent it would set. 
Here is another instance where, de-
spite pressure from some in my party, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
refrained 
from 
eliminating the legislative filibuster. 
He knew how detrimental it would be 
to the U.S. Senate as an institution. 
Basically, what we are hearing now 
about budget reconciliation and consid-
ering eliminating the Byrd rule is es-
sentially a backdoor method to elimi-
nate the filibuster and push the most 
partisan, 
controversial 
measures 
through with only a simple majority. 
In 2001, Senator Byrd said: ‘‘Rec-
onciliation was never, never, never in-
tended to be used as a shield for con-
troversial legislation by depriving Sen-
ators of their rights and their duty to 
debate and amend.’’ But that is pre-
cisely what our Democratic colleagues 
are reported to be considering now—to 
overrule the advice of a nonpartisan 
adviser to the Senate so they can de-
prive Senators of their duty and ability 
to debate and amend legislation. 
I urge our colleagues not to go down 
this road. After all, you would have 
thought they learned a lesson now that 
the shoe is on the other foot when it 
comes to nominations and the fili-
buster. 
In 2013, then-Majority Leader Harry 
Reid went nuclear and eliminated the 
60-vote cloture requirement on judicial 
nominees—something distinct and dif-
ferent from a legislative filibuster but 
applied to nominees. Leader MCCON-
NELL told our colleague from Nevada at 
the time: ‘‘You’ll regret this, and you 
may regret this a lot sooner than you 
think.’’ And as it turned out, he was 
right. 
As our colleagues now know very 
well, the Republican-led Senate con-
firmed more than 230 judges who were 
nominated by President Trump, all 
thanks Harry Reid’s rule change. This 
action cleared the way to eliminate the 
60-vote cloture threshold on Supreme 
Court nominees, which lead to the con-
firmation of three Supreme Court Jus-
tices during the Trump Presidency. 
There are inherent and perhaps unin-
tended consequences of changing the 
rules in a place where your power is 
never permanently guaranteed. Chip-
ping away at the rights of the minority 
may help you now, but you are sure to 
regret that someday, just as Democrats 
now regret the day Harry Reid cleared 
an easy path for hundreds of conserv-
ative Federal judges. 
There are a few ways to stop this 
madness before Democrats head down 
this dangerous path. The first is for 
President Biden to intervene and warn 
Senate Democrats not to break the 
rules by ignoring decades of precedent. 
We are less than 2 weeks in a Biden 
Presidency, which was won on the 
promise of working together. President 
Biden consistently pointed to his expe-
rience as a U.S. Senator as evidence of 
his ability to reach across the aisle to 
get things done. This will be his first 
test. Will he urge Senate Democrats to 
pursue a bipartisan approach to legis-
lating, or will he give up on his single 
largest campaign promise less than 2 
weeks into his administration? 
The second option is for our Demo-
cratic colleagues to speak up. Senators 
MANCHIN and SINEMA stood up to the 
Democratic leader when he threatened 
to eliminate the filibuster. As I see it, 
this is no less dangerous. 
Whatever precedent you set or break 
when you are on one side will affect 
you when you are on the other side, 
which you, inevitably, will ultimately 
be. 
If Democrats destroy the budget rec-
onciliation process now, it will clear 
the way for them to pass a progressive 
agenda with absolutely zero need for 
Republican votes. That could include 
everything from Federal funding for 
abortions to heavyhanded climate poli-
cies. And when Republicans ultimately 
find themselves in the majority, all of 
these policies could be eliminated with 
a party-line vote and replaced with new 
laws. 
This is a dangerous and unnecessary 
road to go down, and our Democratic 
colleagues have a duty, I believe, as 
Members of this body, to respect its 
rules and respect the Senate as an in-
stitution. The Senate should not re-
place the Byrd rule with Harry’s rule. 
I would like to once again share some 
wise words from our late colleague 
Senator Byrd, who was known as a 
master of the Senate rules and process 
and procedure. Not long before his 
death, he spoke in a Senate Rules Com-
mittee hearing about the importance of 
protecting minority rights—something 
the Senate has been known for. Oddly 
enough, the current Democratic leader 
was presiding at the time. Senator 
Byrd said: 
As I have said before, the Senate has been 
the last fortress of minority rights and free-
dom of speech in this Republic for more than 
two centuries. I pray that Senators will 
pause and reflect before ignoring that his-
tory and tradition in favor of the political 
priority of the moment. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, I ask unanimous consent that the 
5:30 p.m. confirmation vote on the 
nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas to 
be Secretary of the Department of 
Homeland Security occur on Tuesday, 
February 2, at 2:30, with all other pro-
visions of the agreement remaining in 
effect. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MYANMAR 
Madam President, at the beginning 
here, I want to briefly address the 
deeply disturbing reports of a coup in 
Myanmar. We are monitoring the situ-
ation with great concern, and the 
Biden administration is already pro-
viding briefings to the Hill on the state 
of affairs. Congress stands ready to 
work collaboratively with the new ad-
ministration to resolve the situation. 
I know this is a region of long-
standing concern and interest to the 
Republican leader, so I hope that we 
can productively work together in a bi-
partisan fashion to determine the best 
course of action for America’s interest 
and for the people of Myanmar. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, next, this week 
the Senate will continue to confirm 
President Biden’s outstanding Cabinet 
nominees. We had intended to finish 
the 
confirmation 
of 
Alejandro 
Mayorkas to serve as Secretary of 
Homeland Security today, but unfortu-
nately, with winter storms hitting 
much of the east coast, Mr. Mayorkas’s 
confirmation will be delayed until to-
morrow to accommodate Members who 
are having difficulty getting here. 
We will also vote tomorrow on the 
confirmation of former South Bend 
Mayor Pete Buttigieg to serve as our 
Nation’s next Secretary of Transpor-
tation. Mr. Buttigieg is an impressive 
public servant who has already earned 
the respect and confidence of both 
sides. He was reported out of the com-
mittee last week on an overwhelming 
bipartisan vote, and I look forward to 
confirming his nomination tomorrow. 
Now, as we process these nomina-
tions on the floor, our Senate commit-
tees are hard at work preparing the 
next slate of nominees, including Sec-
retaries of Agriculture, Energy, Vet-
erans Affairs, Commerce, Education, 
Labor, EPA, and more. We have a lot of 
work to do here, but the Senate is 
going to press forward on these nomi-
nations as quickly as possible. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, at the same time, 
the Senate this week will begin the im-
portant work of crafting legislation to 
rescue the American people and the 
American economy from the continued 
effects of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
We continue to face a crisis unlike 
any other in our lifetimes. Over the 
course of a year, more than 26 million 
Americans contracted the virus and 
nearly 450,000 have died—more than the 
number of Americans who died during 
World War II. Tens of millions of 
Americans have lost their jobs, thou-
sands of businesses closed their doors 
for good, and the economy has suffered 
the worst year of growth, again, since 
World War II. 
Our efforts here in Congress over the 
past year have saved scores of small

businesses and kept millions of Ameri-
cans in their home and out of poverty, 
but our work is far from completed. 
As we speak, nearly a million Ameri-
cans are filing for unemployment per 
week. More than 16 million Americans 
have reported being thousands of dol-
lars behind on the rent, on mortgage, 
on utilities. Elderly Americans are 
having their heat shut off in the depths 
of winter. Families are having the 
power and internet shut off during 
their children’s first year of virtual 
kindergarten. 
Small 
businesses 
we 
have done so much to help through the 
PPP and other bipartisan programs 
will struggle until we can vaccinate 
enough Americans to get the country 
back to normal. 
Facing these multifaceted challenges 
of a scale and scope larger than any 
event in the past hundred years, Con-
gress must pursue a bold and robust 
course of action. It makes no sense to 
pinch pennies when so many Americans 
are struggling. The risk of doing too 
little is far greater than the risk of 
doing too much. 
Our history is full of warnings about 
the costs of small thinking during 
times of great challenge. President 
Hoover failed to react quickly enough 
to forestall a Great Depression. In the 
wake of our most recent financial cri-
sis in 2009, Congress was too timid and 
constrained, and the ensuing recovery 
was long, slow, and painful. 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Yellen, 
who 
watched the most recent recovery up 
close, just told us that ‘‘the smartest 
thing we can do is act big.’’ Let me re-
peat that. ‘‘The smartest thing we can 
do is act big,’’ according to Treasury 
Secretary Yellen. So that is what the 
Senate is going to do—act big. 
Today, Speaker PELOSI and I will file 
a joint budget resolution for fiscal year 
2021 totaling $1.9 trillion, which is the 
first step in giving Congress an addi-
tional legislative tool to quickly pass 
the COVID relief legislation. The reso-
lution, if passed by both Chambers of 
Congress, will provide instructions for 
the House and Senate committees to 
begin work on a potential budget rec-
onciliation bill, which will be the vehi-
cle for urgent and necessary COVID re-
lief. 
Now, I want to be very clear. There is 
nothing in this process that will pre-
clude it from being bipartisan. We wel-
come—welcome—Republican input. Let 
me say that again. There is nothing in 
this process—the budget resolution or 
reconciliation—that 
precludes 
our 
work from being bipartisan. In fact, 
the Senate has used this process no 
fewer than 17 times to pass bipartisan 
legislation since 1980, including to cre-
ate or expand landmark programs like 
children’s health insurance, the child 
tax credit, and the earned income tax 
credit, which together have lifted mil-
lions of Americans out of poverty. 
COVID relief, too, should be the work 
of both Democrats and Republicans. 
Teachers and firefighters are being laid 
off in red States and blue States. 
American families are struggling with 
the rent and utilities in Kentucky as 
well as in New York. 
We should all be eager to provide our 
country the resources it needs to fi-
nally beat this disease and return our 
country to normal. To that end, Demo-
crats welcome the ideas and input of 
our Senate Republican colleagues. The 
only thing we cannot accept is a pack-
age that is too small or too narrow to 
pull our country out of this emergency. 
We cannot repeat the mistake of 2009, 
and we must act very soon to get this 
assistance to those so desperately in 
need. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is

NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO NICHOLAS 
MAYORKAS 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
rise to speak about a friend of mine, 
Ali Mayorkas. He is President Biden’s 
choice to head up the Department of 
Homeland Security. Now, I don’t need 
to tell the folks in this Chamber how 
big of a job this is, but let me be clear: 
It is our duty to put somebody in this 
role who is up to the task of getting 
things done, and I am here to assure 
you that Ali Mayorkas is that man. 
I worked closely with Ali when he 
was Deputy Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity in the Obama administration. It 
is obvious that he has the under-
standing of the challenges that this 
country 
is 
facing—from 
the 
coronavirus pandemic to immigration, 
to cybersecurity, to threats from our 
foreign adversaries and now, more than 
ever, from our domestic ones. Perhaps, 
most 
importantly, 
he 
has 
dem-
onstrated that he is going to listen and 
learn about the unique problems facing 
each State in this Union. 
He proved that to me when I brought 
him to Montana back in 2015. We flew 
along the Montana-Canada border and 
visited 
the 
Ports 
of 
Piegan 
and 
Sweetgrass before hosting a roundtable 
on human trafficking in Havre, just a 
little more than 50 miles from where I 
live. We also held listening sessions on 
law enforcement and first responders in 
Helena. We met with local businesses 
to discuss cross-border trade and even 
met with union representatives from 
Customs and Border Protection. He 
traveled thousands of miles to hear 
firsthand what Montanans had to say, 
and because of it, he understood what 
our State needed from him in order to 
be successful with our homeland secu-
rity. That, folks, is what leadership 
looks like. 
Over the past 4 years, we have seen 
the Department of Homeland Security 
in turmoil with six different Secre-
taries. We need a steady hand, a steady 
hand like Ali Mayorkas’s, to get us 
back on track. After all, he spent 7 
years in leadership roles in the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. He under-
stands the challenges. He understands 
it is going to take a lot of work. He un-
derstands that we are going to have to 
bring people together, and he under-
stands that this job is a 24/7 job. He un-
derstands because he has lived it. He 
has the knowledge and the experience 
to lead our Nation’s Homeland Secu-
rity today and prepare for the chal-
lenges of tomorrow. 
Now, it is my understanding that to-
morrow, at 2:30, we will vote on Ali 
Mayorkas as Secretary of Homeland 
Security. I would hope that we would 
get a strong vote for him out of this 
body because, quite frankly, after the 
events of January 6, we have no time 
to waste. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RECOGNIZING THE UTAH 
NATIONAL GUARD 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise 
today to honor and thank the men and 
women of the Utah National Guard for 
their dedication and selfless service in 
protecting the U.S. Capitol. Each and 
every one of these guardsmen played 
an important role in our Nation’s Cap-
ital these last weeks. I truly respect 
and admire their commitment to serve 
not just the people of Utah but wher-
ever they are stationed.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 144. A bill to authorize the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services, 
acting through the Director of the In-
dian Health Service, to acquire private 
land to facilitate access to the Desert 
Sage Youth Wellness Center in Hemet, 
California, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Indian Affairs. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to reintroduce a bill to fa-
cilitate improved access to the Indian 
Health Service’s Desert Sage Youth 
Wellness Center in Hemet, California. 
My colleague Senator ALEX PADILLA 
(D–CA) is joining me as an original co-
sponsor of the bill. 
The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Cen-
ter is the only currently operating cen-
ter in the State of California that pro-
vides 
culturally-sensitive 
substance 
use disorder treatment to indigenous 
youth. 
The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Cen-
ter, located in Hemet, is run by the In-
dian Health Service. The facility not 
only provides healthcare, but also aca-
demic support, family therapy, and 
treatment plans to support the healing 
and long-term recovery of youth en-
rolled at the Center. 
Currently, the Desert Sage Youth 
Wellness Center is only accessible by a 
dirt road. This limits access to the 
Center during California’s extreme wet 
and dry seasons. The dirt road fre-
quently cracks or floods during these 
times and creates significant chal-
lenges to those depending on the Cen-
ter’s important work. 
The Indian Health Service does not 
currently have the authority to buy 
land from willing private landowners 
who are supportive of selling their land 
to provide for a paved access road. It is 
necessary that we provide for safe and 
dignified access to the center, and I am 
pleased to reintroduce this legislation 
to do so. 
This commonsense bill would author-
ize the Director of the Indian Health 
Service to purchase land from willing 
sellers and construct a paved road to 
improve access to the Desert Sage 
Youth 
Wellness 
Center. 
After 
the 
road’s construction, Riverside County 
would maintain it. 
This bill has the support of local 
stakeholders, 
including 
Riverside 
County. An identical, bipartisan bill is 
being introduced by Representatives 
RAUL RUIZ (D–CA), KEN CALVERT (R– 
CA), NANETTE BARRAGA´ N (D–CA), TONY 
CA´ RDENAS (D–CA), and PETE AGUILAR 
(D–CA) in the House of Representa-
tives. 
This bill passed the Senate unani-
mously last year, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues this Con-
gress to enact this bill into law. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor.

HONORING COACH SEAN DESAI 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to honor Coach Sean Desai, the 
first person of South Asian and Indian heritage 
to attain the elite position of Defensive Coordi-
nator in the National Football League (NFL). 
Sean’s trailblazing ascent with the Chicago 
Bears football team serves as a shining exam-
ple of what South Asian and Indian-Americans 
can achieve in our nation and in professional 
sports. 
Coach Desai was born in Shelton, Con-
necticut and attended Boston University, 
where he majored in Philosophy and Political 
Science and graduated Cum Laude in 2004. 
He then earned a master’s degree in higher 
and postsecondary education from Columbia 
University, and a doctorate in educational ad-
ministration 
from 
Temple 
University. 
Postdoctorate, Coach Desai served as an ad-
junct professor at Temple and Defensive and 
Special Teams’ Coordinator for the Temple 
Owls football team. He joined the University of 
Miami as Assistant Director of Football Oper-
ations in 2011 and spent the 2012 season as 
the Running Backs’ Coach and Special 
Teams’ Coordinator at Boston College. 
In 2013, Coach Desai was hired by the Chi-
cago Bears as a Quality Control Assistant, 
working with defensive backs and linebackers 
while assisting the special teams’ coaches. 
Coach Desai held this position until 2018, 
when he was promoted to Safeties Coach. His 
colleagues attribute Coach Desai’s meteoric 
rise to his experience as an educator and his 
ability to connect with his players. In his own 
words: 
The ability to develop and have a chance 
to lead young men and bring them past what 
they can do . . . opened my eyes to a whole 
new world of education. To me, that’s what 
an educator has to do-whatever you are 
teaching . . . I mean, if you’re not out there 
to develop and help bring kids to a place that 
they can’t be on their own, then I don’t know 
what the purpose of education is. 
Racial biases have thwarted upward mobility 
for men and women of color since the NFL’s 
inception in 1920. As the first South-Asian and 
Indian-American Defensive Coordinator in the 
NFL, Coach Desai will inspire young men and 
women of all ethnicities and races to believe 
that they can and should aspire to positions of 
leadership in professional sports. 
As a die-hard Chicago Bears fan, I am 
thrilled to congratulate Coach Sean Desai on 
his remarkable achievement with the Bears 
and the trail he is blazing for future genera-
tions. I wish him great success in his new role 
and in all his future endeavors. Let’s Go 
Bears! 
CONGRATULATING 
DEREK 
BERGSTEN OF ROCKFORD FOR 
RECEIVING THE ‘‘FIRE CHIEF OF 
THE YEAR’’ AWARD FROM THE 
ILLINOIS FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIA-
TION 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Derek Bergsten for winning the 
Fire Chief of the Year Award from the Illinois 
Fire Chiefs Association. This honor recognizes 
an exemplary fire chief who makes ‘‘significant 
ongoing contributions’’ to the profession and 
who was a full-time chief serving a city of 
more than 25,000 people. 
After joining the Rockford Fire Department 
in 1994, Derek worked his way through the 
ranks to become a Captain, In 2007, he was 
named chief, becoming just the 10th chief in 
department history since 1880, During his time 
he created a mobile integrated health program 
that has worked to reduce visits to area emer-
gency rooms, hospital admissions, and ambu-
lance calls, Derek is responsible for the suc-
cess of departmental accreditation through the 
Center for Public Safety Excellence, Commis-
sion on Accreditation of Ambulance Services, 
and Accreditation for Government Fleet Man-
agement Services. He expanded the certified 
fire vehicle repair shop operated by the de-
partment to reduce down time for fire equip-
ment across the region while creating rev-
enue, He also created a program that allows 
Rockford fire personnel to transport patients 
experiencing a mental health issue to the 
Rosecrance Mulberry Center for evaluation 
rather than a potentially stressful emergency 
room, In order to prevent overdose deaths, he 
created a program that provides Naloxone kits 
and training to the families of those who have 
overdosed, driving down the number of opioid 
overdose deaths, Derek is the first Fire Chief 
from our region chosen for this honor in over 
forty years. I commend him on his work to bet-
ter the Rockford community through his job as 
a fire chief. 
It is because of leaders such as Derek 
Bergsten that I am especially proud to serve 
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally recog-
nize Derek Bergsten for winning the Fire Chief 
of the Year Award.

LEXINGTON 
MEDICAL 
CENTER 
50TH ANNIVERSARY PROCLAMA-
TION 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, Lexington Medical Center celebrated 
its 50th anniversary in January 2021. 
From starting as a small community hospital 
in 1971 to becoming the anchor of a modern 
medical complex today, the hospital’s mission 
is to provide quality health services that meet 
the needs of the community. 
In 1966, voters approved a referendum for 
the hospital, creating the biggest development 
project ever in Lexington County. A gracious 
donation of more than 22 acres of land from 
the Hulon family provided the site in West Co-
lumbia. 
On January 6, 1971, Lexington County Hos-
pital, as it was first called, a four-story building 
a fraction of the size of the hospital today, 
opened. There were 125 beds and 250 em-
ployees. 
Over the years, Lexington Medical Center 
has emerged as a leader in health care. It 
grew steadily into a large health care organi-
zation with a wide variety of services. 
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Lexington 
Medical Center pioneered community medical 
centers throughout Lexington County, created 
the Lexington Medical Center Foundation, 
began operating a skilled nursing facility and 
Alzheimer’s care center, and established a 
physician network with a variety of medical 
specialties. 
In the early 2000s, Lexington Medical Cen-
ter added a new tower to its campus along 
with medical office buildings. 
In 2012, Lexington Medical Center began 
providing a full range of heart services includ-
ing open heart surgery and therapeutic cardiac 
catheterizations. Since then, Lexington Med-
ical Center’s heart program has established 
itself as a national leader in cardiac care, 
earning a three-star rating—the highest rating 
possible—from The Society of Thoracic Sur-
geons, and becoming one of only 30 hospitals 
in 
the 
United 
States 
to 
receive 
a 
HeartCARETM Center National Distinction of 
Excellence from the American College of Car-
diology. 
In 2019, Lexington Medical Center com-
pleted the largest hospital expansion in South 
Carolina history when it opened its new pa-
tient care tower. 
Today, Lexington Medical Center has 557 
beds, four community medical centers, 70 
physician practices and more than 7,000 em-
ployees. The network also has an occupa-
tional health center and the largest skilled 
nursing facility in the Carolinas. Lexington 
Medical Center operates one of the busiest 
Emergency departments in South Carolina, 
treating nearly 90,000 patients each year. The 
hospital delivers approximately 4,000 babies 
each year, performs more than 27,000 sur-
geries and has more than 1,000,000 physician 
office visits. 
Lexington Medical Center has received local 
and national awards for its outstanding patient 
care. 
As the only locally owned, independent hos-
pital in the Midlands, Lexington Medical Cen-
ter strives to offer the most outstanding care 
to our families, friends and neighbors now and 
in the future.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
DR. 
CHARLES 
EUGENE 
COWLES, JR. 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of my dear friend Dr. 
Charles Eugene Cowles, Jr. of Houston, 
Texas. Dr. Cowles went to be with the Lord on 
December 26, 2020 following a motor vehicle 
accident. 
Charles was born on April 19, 1968, to 
Charles Eugene Cowles, Sr. and Carol Janice 
Wood Cowles in Houston, Texas, at Hermann 
Hospital. He grew up in the Houston area with 
varied interests and developed lifelong friend-
ships in the process. Charles suffered a per-
sonal tragedy as a young adult when his fa-
ther died unexpectedly. 
In 1986, Charles completed an associate’s 
degree and became a paramedic and fire-
fighter with the Beaumont Fire Department. He 
pursued degrees in sports medicine and nurs-
ing and completed studies to become a reg-
istered nurse (RN) in 1998 and also worked in 
area trauma centers in the ER as a nurse. He 
continued as a paramedic supervisor until 
1995, when he began teaching EMS courses 
at San Jacinto College. Charles also had the 
opportunity to assist in the creation of curricula 
for medical training of NASA astronauts serv-
ing aboard the International Space Station and 
personally instructed several classes of Astro-
nauts and Cosmonauts in emergency medical 
response at the Johnson Space Center in 
Houston from 1995 to 2006. Charles obtained 
his bachelor’s degree in Sports Medicine from 
the University of Houston in 1998. He later 
earned a master’s degree in business admin-
istration from the University of Tennessee, 
Knoxville in 2013. 
Charles took the next step in his profes-
sional career when he began medical school 
at the University of Texas Health Sciences 
Center—Houston. He graduated in 2004 and 
accepted an anesthesiology residency at UT 
Houston, training in the same hospital where 
he was born. Upon completing his residency, 
he joined the faculty in the Anesthesia division 
at the world-renowned MD Anderson Cancer 
Center, working as a neuro-anesthesiologist, 
and rose to the rank of Professor before his 
untimely death. 
Dr. Cowles used the knowledge and wisdom 
he gained as a first responder throughout his 
medical and professional career. He served on 
multiple institutional safety committees and 
was ultimately named the chief safety officer 
for the Anesthesiology Division in 2016. 
Charles was an international expert in oper-
ating room fire safety and traveled worldwide 
teaching from his unique experience as both a 
firefighter and anesthesiologist. He served on 
multiple committees for local, state, and na-
tional medical societies. Not wanting to limit 
his contributions solely to anesthesia, Dr. 
Cowles also served as the Tactical Medical 
Director of the Pasadena Police Department 
and as the Local Health Authority for the City 
of Pasadena, Texas. Additionally, Dr. Cowles 
advised my staff, and I, on health care policy 
matters. 
Inside and outside of work, his family, and 
faith were essential to Charles. Dr. Cowles 
was highly involved at First Baptist Church of 
Pasadena, where he served as a deacon and 
director of the church’s medical committee. 
Charles was also a Board Member of First 
Baptist Christian Academy where his three 
sons attended elementary and middle school. 
He also served on the board of Youth Reach 
Houston, a home for troubled boys. 
Dr. Cowles was a man of many personal 
and professional achievements, but more than 
all he was a family man. He and his loving 
wife Jennifer Kendrick Cowles met when she 
attended one of Charles’ paramedic courses in 
1995. Charles and Jennifer married on May 
19, 2000 and celebrated twenty years of mar-
riage earlier in 2020. Together they have three 
sons Christopher, Caleb and Jacob. 
Dr. Charles Eugene Cowles, Jr. lived a full 
life focused on being a husband, father, man 
of faith, physician, first responder, teacher, 
medical leader, a connoisseur of barbeque, 
and grand storyteller. For all these things, he 
will be missed by many—myself included. I 
will continue to keep his family, medical family, 
and his friends in my prayers.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL 
GUARD HOME RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia National 
Guard Home Rule Act, which would give the 
mayor of the District of Columbia control over 
the D.C. National Guard. I am very pleased 
that 
Congresswoman 
CAROLYN
MALONEY, 
Chair of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, which has primary jurisdiction over this 
bill, is an original cosponsor, as is Congress-
man ANTHONY BROWN, a member of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services, which also has ju-
risdiction over this bill. The mayor of the Dis-
trict should have the same authority over the 
D.C. National Guard that governors of the 
states and territories have over their National 
Guards. Each governor—including the gov-
ernors of the three U.S. territories with Na-
tional Guards—has the authority to deploy 
their National Guard to protect his or her state 
or territory, just as local militia did historically. 
The events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 
2021, and the events at Lafayette Square on 
June 1, 2020, are prime examples of why this 
bill is so important. 
The National Guards in the states and terri-
tories operate under dual federal and local ju-
risdiction. Yet the D.C. National Guard oper-
ates under the sole jurisdiction of the presi-
dent. Today, by far the most likely need for 
the D.C. National Guard here would be for 
natural disasters, such as hurricanes and 
floods, and to restore order in the wake of civil 
disturbances. The mayor, who knows the city 
better than any federal official and who works 
closely with federal security officials, should be 
able to call out the D.C. National Guard for 
local natural disasters and civil disturbances. 
The president should be focused on national 
matters, including homeland security, not local 
D.C. matters. If it makes sense that governors 
have control over their National Guards, it 
makes equal sense for the mayor of the Dis-
trict, with a population the size of a small 
state, to have the same authority. 
My bill is another important step toward 
completing the transfer of full self-government 
powers to the District that Congress began 
with the passage of the Home Rule Act of 
1973, when it delegated most of its authority 
over District matters to an elected mayor and 
Council. The bill follows that model. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS

Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today

ceived an award from the American Library 
Association for their efforts—becoming the 
only library in North America to win in this cat-
egory. 
The Moline Public Library has made a spe-
cial effort in recent years to make their library 
more accessible for everyone in their commu-
nity—beginning with a reading and education 
book club for people with disabilities. Addition-
ally, the Moline Public Library works with ARC 
of the Quad Cities and Quad City Arts to pro-
vide programming and activities for engage-
ment. I commend the Moline Public Library for 
its work with people with disabilities, and I 
thank them for their continued service to the 
Moline community. 
It is because of community leaders such as 
the Moline Public Library that I am especially 
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to again 
formally honor the Moline Public Library for 
winning an award from the American Library 
Association for its work with people with dis-
abilities.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SCHOOL 
COUNSELING WEEK 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the tireless work of school coun-
selors across the country and in the 38th dis-
trict of California that I am honored to rep-
resent. These public servants help develop 
well-rounded 
students 
by 
guiding 
them 
through their academic, social-emotional, and 
career development. 
Marla Diaz, a counselor at El Rancho High 
School in Pico Rivera, California, is exactly the 
type of champion students need. Marla has 
been a counselor since 2001 and has been in-
strumental in the lives of the students she 
works with in the school. 
Not only does Marla know all the students 
in her caseload of 400 but she also has cre-
ated workshops and presentations for students 
and parents on the programs available at the 
school. Her leadership within the Project Lead 
the Way Biomedical Sciences and Engineering 
programs has helped students learn and apply 
a hands-on approach to solving and designing

solutions to health and engineering chal-
lenges, respectively. With her support, she 
has helped many students learn and find op-
portunities after high school. Her office is not 
only filled with her warmth but with pictures of 
former students, each one a life she has im-
pacted and inspired. She is even known to 
have former students and families reach out 
for her guidance. 
Counselors like Marla, provide so much for 
our students. Not only do they help with ca-
reer and college choices, but they are often 
the ones who help students cope with serious 
and common challenges of growing up, includ-
ing peer pressure, bullying, mental health 
issues, trauma, disciplinary problems, and 
more. Unfortunately, the average student- 
counselor-ratio is 430-to-1 nationally which is 
almost double the American School Counselor 
Association recommended ratio of 250-to-1. 
Our students deserve to have the support of 
school counselors, and school counselors de-
serve our support. 
That is why I am proud to introduce a reso-
lution to designate the week of February I, 
2021, through February 5, 2021, as National 
School Counseling Week. I ask that all Mem-
bers join me in recognizing the extraordinary 
work and dedication our school counselors 
have done to better the lives of young stu-
dents.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF JOHN E. 
MOORE, SR. 
HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to pay tribute to the life and memory of John 
E. Moore, Sr., a distinguished community 
leader from my hometown of Dayton, Ohio, 
who passed away on January 7, 2021, four 
days before his 98th birthday. 
John E. Moore, Sr. was a native of Bir-
mingham, Alabama, whose family moved to 
Dayton, Ohio shortly after he was born. He 
graduated from Wilbur Wright High School in 
1941. He was a veteran of the U.S. Army and 
served in the 2261st Quartermaster Trucking 
Company in Bangladesh, during World War II. 
After the war, John earned a degree in busi-
ness administration from the University of 
Dayton and went on to pursue graduate stud-
ies at Ohio State University. 
He served for 35 years as a civilian em-
ployee at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He 
was the first Equal Employment Opportunity 
officer at Wright-Patterson in 1960, and be-
came the first African-American chief of civil-
ian personnel in 1972. 
In addition to serving our nation, John was 
involved with his church and his community 
his entire life. He gained a reputation as 
someone to go to when you needed some-
thing done. He had an active role in numerous 
civic organizations, including the Dayton Foun-
dation, the Out-of-School Youth Task Force, 
Sinclair Community College’s board of trust-
ees, the Montgomery County Job Center, and 
was co-founder of Parity, Inc., which provides 
a mentoring program for urban middle school 
students that has helped many underserved 
young people gain the skills and self-con-
fidence to become successful, productive 
adults. 
John E. Moore’s name can be found etched 
along the sidewalks on the Dayton Walk of 
Fame, among a small circle of distinguished 
citizens who have impacted our city for the 
better. In 2014, the Dayton International 
Peace Museum named John a Peace Hero, in 
recognition of his leadership in youth, edu-
cation, health, and civil rights. His lifetime of 
public service set an example for all of us who 
work to serve our communities and our nation. 
I am honored to have known him as a friend. 
On behalf of all those whose lives were 
touched by John’s friendship and community 
service, I offer his family my heartfelt condo-
lences.

CONGRATULATING KAI SWANSON 
FOR WINNING THE ‘‘I HAVE A 
DREAM’’ 
AWARD 
FROM 
THE 
ROCK ISLAND MARTIN LUTHER 
KING, JR. COMMUNITY CENTER 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Kai Swanson for winning the ‘‘I 
Have a Dream’’ Award from the Rock Island 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Center. 
Kai is a Rock Island native who works as 
the Special Assistant to Augustana College’s 
President. Kai gives so much of himself to 
help others, and it is truly inspiring. He has 
also received several awards for his service to 
the Rock Island community, such as a Rock 
Island Rotary community service award, the 
Habitat Hero award from Quad Cities Habitat 
for Humanity, the Professional Citizen of the 
Year (1998) from the City of Rock Island, and 
the Outstanding Community Service Award 
from the Metropolitan Community Church. Kai 
is currently serving on the Quad Cities Holo-
caust Remembrance Committee, is a member 
of the Rock Island NAACP and is a board 
member for the Doris and Victor Day Founda-
tion. Apart from his duties on those boards, he 
is also a Visit Quad Cities board member and 
a Rock Island County board member. Addi-
tionally, Kai is president of the county Forest 
Preserve Commission. His commitment to his 
community is palpable and I commend him on 
his work to better the Rock Island community 
through lifting others and addressing problems 
head-on to affect change. 
It is because of leaders such as Kai Swan-
son that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally recognize Kai 
Swanson for receiving the ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ 
Award from the Martin Luther King, Jr. Com-
munity Center in Rock Island, Illinois.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF JOHN T. ‘‘MIKE’’ WOLF 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take a moment to commemorate the 100th 
birthday of one of my constituents, John T. 
‘‘Mike’’ Wolf. In 2015, Mr. Wolf was awarded 
Congress’ highest civilian award, the Congres-
sional Gold Medal. He and three dozen Amer-
ican Fighter Aces were honored for their war 
contributions in World War II and subsequent 
wars. 
The ceremony that took place in May 2015 
was convened by Seattle’s Museum of Flight 
and recognized the accomplishments of the 
1,447 American Aces who achieved the elite 
designation. Six years ago, only 77 Aces were 
alive, and approximately 36 of them gathered 
in Washington, D.C. to receive the recognition 
in person. 
As Mr. Wolf celebrates his 100th birthday on 
February 4th, I wanted to take a moment to 
bring distinction once again to his service and 
dedication to our country. The stories of the 
Fighter Aces cover some of the most forma-
tive periods in aviation history. Some gained 
their victories in open-cockpit biplanes, others 
in the powerful propeller-driven fighters of 
World War II, and still others in the jets that 
fought over Korea and Southeast Asia. Aces 
come from each major combat branch of the 
U.S. military and nearly every state in the 
union. 
Wolf trained in a Boeing N–25–3 Shearman, 
then fought in a Grumman F6F–3 Hellcat and 
the Grumman F4F–3 Wildcat. He was a mem-
ber of Fighter Squadron Two during World 
War II, whose roster included Lt. Cmdr. Butch 
O’Hare, namesake of Chicago’s O’Hare Inter-
national Airport; and Cmdr. Roy ‘‘Butch’’ Voris, 
who is the founder of the Blue Angels. 
Recounting his experience Mr. Wolf re-
called, ‘‘I was more scared of not being able 
to do the right thing. We had received six 
months of training. My fear was, can I analyze 
[the situation] and do the right thing?’’ He 
didn’t get a lot of time to analyze the situation. 
An engagement might last the few seconds it 
took to get some shots off, or it could be 
longer. All told, Wolf downed seven Japanese 
fighter planes—three in one day, and five be-
tween June 11 and 19, 1944. He received the 
Distinguished Flying Cross and four Air Med-
als. 
After the war, Wolf embarked on a career in 
life insurance to support his young family. The 
discipline of a Navy pilot came in handy be-
cause he didn’t exactly enjoy selling life insur-
ance. He would tell you, ‘‘I got good at it and 
stuck with it.’’ 
Today, we honor and celebrate John ‘‘Mike’’ 
Wolf—whose love for the Navy has never 
wavered and whose service to his country and 
community is greatly appreciated and will be 
long remembered.

IN RECOGNITION OF GABRIELLA 
MAYREND FOR ACHIEVING THE 
RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Gabriella Mayrend of Ypsi-
lanti for achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. A 
freshman at Huron High School in Ann Arbor, 
Miss Mayrend of Troop 439G, is the first fe-
male Eagle Scout from the Huron Trails Dis-
trict based in Washtenaw County and is a 
member of the inaugural female Eagle Scout 
class. 
Miss Mayrend was inspired to join Scouts 
BSA because of her love of adventure and the 
outdoors. Since then she has earned an im-
pressive forty-one merit badges while serving 
as a leader in her all-female troop. Since 
1910, Scouts BSA has taught members the 
fundamentals of becoming a responsible cit-
izen who makes moral and ethical choices in 
their lives. Eagle Scouts are leaders in every 
sense of the word, and Gabriella is no dif-
ferent. Miss Mayrend is the newest Eagle 
Scout in her family and is upholding the leg-
acy that began with her great-grandfather. 
Her project, entitled Faholo Fire was com-
pleted at Camp Faholo in Grass Lake, a local 
camp that requested her assistance in rebuild-
ing their four firepits. She repaired the decay-
ing firepits and constructed twenty new bench-
es and handcrafted four new firewood storage 
boxes. Additionally, she cleaned and repainted 
the camp’s existing benches and upgraded 
them to a new set of swinging benches. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in congratulating Gabriella Mayrend 
for becoming the first female in the Huron 
Trails District to achieve the rank of Eagle 
Scout. We are grateful for her service and 
dedication to the Washtenaw County commu-
nity.

THANKING THE SHERRARD HIGH

FFA 
FOR 
DONATING 
PRODUCE TO LOCAL FOOD PAN-
TRIES 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank the Sherrard High School FFA for do-
nating over 2,766 pounds of homegrown 
produce to local food pantries in Sherrard and 
Milan, Illinois. 
The Sherrard FFA manages a garden used 
to grow produce for local food pantries to help 
those with food insecurity. Students drive the 
produce to local food banks to donate to those 
in need. The COVID–19 pandemic has cre-
ated heightened food insecurity in our commu-
nities and around the country. The Sherrard 
FFA provides a much-needed service to the 
local community. I commend the efforts of the 
Sherrard FFA, and I am proud of the selfless 
work they are doing to feed the hungry. 
It is because of community leaders such as 
the Sherrard FFA that I am especially proud to 
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
thank the Sherrard FFA for donating freshly 
grown produce to local food pantries, helping 
to alleviate the insecurities families in our dis-
trict face today.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF ST. JAMES WINERY 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the Hofherr family 
on the 50th anniversary of St. James Winery. 
Since James and Patricia Hofherr first opened 
their business in 1970, St. James Winery has 
rejuvenated the local Italian wine culture in the 
St. James area. The Hofherr’s chose this area 
because of its deep heritage of grape growing 
and winemaking. This tradition dates to 1898 
when local Italian immigrants established the 
first vineyards in the region. With such produc-
tive Missouri soil and favorable weather pat-
terns for grape growing, this Mid-Missouri lo-
cation was nothing shy of an excellent choice 
to begin St. James Winery. 
In the first year, the winery produced 3,000 
cases of wine, and 50 years later, it produces 
nearly 250,000 cases each year. St. James 
Winery now has five vineyards, totaling 185 
acres, and the winery sees almost 125,000 
visitors annually. Located along Old Route 66, 
St. James Winery brings tourists from all over 
the world to Mid-Missouri. The winery is also 
one of the most awarded wineries in the entire 
United States. 
Today, St. James Winery is being operated 
by the second generation of the Hofherr family 
and will see the third generation joining in the 
summer of 2021. For 50 years of excellent 
service to people across this nation, as well as 
across the world, it is my honor to congratu-
late St. James Winery.

RECOGNIZING AND THANKING THE 
VIRGINIA NATIONAL GUARD 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and thank the Virginia Na-
tional Guard for their outstanding work during 
and after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol 
on January 6, 2021. These men and women 
honored the call of our country, forsaking pre-
cious time with their families, to serve and 
maintain our democracy. 
Virginia’s National Guard provided a sorely 
needed response on January 6, with the Quick 
Reaction Force out of Manassas arriving with-
in 12 hours of receiving D.C. Mayor Muriel 
Bowser’s request for assistance. In the fol-
lowing days, thousands of citizen-soldiers from 
across our great Commonwealth deployed to 
defend our nation’s capital. These individuals 
made tremendous sacrifices to uproot their 
lives in the defense of democracy; within a 
matter of days, and in some cases even 
hours, members of the Virginia National Guard 
took leave from their regular jobs and de-
ployed to Washington, D.C. without knowing 
when they would return home. I am especially 
proud of the men and women from across the 
Fourth Congressional District of Virginia who 
served, including BTroop, 2nd Squadron—183 
Calvary Regiment from Suffolk, VA, 1710th 
Transportation Company from Emporia, VA, 
and 276th Engineer Battalion from Petersburg, 
VA. 
These brave individuals remained dedicated 
to the mission for weeks at a time, despite the 
U.S. Capitol not offering the level of hospitality 
our heroes deserve. While in the city, they 
persevered while sleeping on cold floors, 
being shunted disrespectfully into parking ga-
rages, and lacking access to quality food. 
When I had the opportunity to meet with our 
Virginia National Guard while attending the in-
auguration, I was struck by how they main-
tained their cheerful spirit despite these chal-
lenging and weighty responsibilities. This is a 
testament to their true character as Virginians, 
who are called to service regardless of the 
conditions and the mission given to them. The 
Virginia National Guard provided crucial sup-
port for the preservation of our democracy. 
Due to the sacrifices of thousands of our 
Commonwealth’s brave soldiers and airmen, 
in coordination with other State National 
Guard units from across our nation, we were 
able to inaugurate President Joseph R. Biden, 
Jr. and Vice President KAMALA D. HARRIS on 
the same hallowed grounds where a violent 
mob sought to overturn the certification of our 
national election just two weeks prior. 
Time and again, ‘‘The Commonwealths 
Guardians’’ have served Virginia and the 
United States of America and will continue to 
do so when called upon. The actions of our 
Commonwealth’s brave citizen-soldiers dem-
onstrate the indominable fortitude of the Vir-
ginia National Guard. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing and honoring the brave 
members of the Virginia National Guard who 
answered the call to service in defense of our 
nation’s capital to ensure the preservation of 
our cherished democracy.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA PAROLE AND SU-
PERVISED RELEASE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce the District of Columbia Parole 
and Supervised Release Act. This bill would 
give the District of Columbia the authority to 
make parole and supervised release deter-
minations for D.C. Code offenders beginning 
on November 1, 2022. 
Currently, the U.S. Parole Commission 
(Commission) makes these determinations for 
D.C. Code offenders. This bill would give D.C. 
the same authority over parole and supervised 
release determinations for D.C. Code offend-
ers that the Commission has today. The Dis-
trict has asked to have this authority for its 
own local offenders. D.C. would have the 
same authority the states possess over their 
own local offenders on these matters, includ-
ing the authority to devise an adjudication sys-
tem as it sees fit.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOE 
TERRONEZ 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Joe Terronez the first Mexi-
can-American Mayor in the State of Illinois 
and long-time Silvis City Council Member. 
Joe was born February 15, 1929 in a boxcar 
in the Silvis yards, the son of Benito and 
Felisa Anguiano Terronez. He married Re-
becca Herrera on November 6, 1948, and to-
gether they had 8 children. As a devout 
Catholic and lifelong member of Our Lady of 
Guadalupe Church, Joe was always a strong 
member of the community. Joe attended Silvis 
public schools and proudly graduated from 
United Township High School in 1947. He was 
employed by International Harvester Company 
in East Moline as a repairman and retired in 
1984 after 33 years. Throughout his lifetime 
he was a member of several religious, labor, 
political, and civic organizations and was most 
proud to work with veterans. He was an Hon-
orary member of the Mexican American Vet-
erans Association (MAVA) and Hero Street 
Memorial Committee. He was also a proud 
union member and loyal to the Democratic 
Party. His love of family, faith, and community 
were most important through his life. He 
served the City of Silvis and his community for 
30 years—26 years as First Ward Alderman 
and four years as Mayor. Joe was honored to 
be the first elected Hispanic Mayor in the 
State of Illinois. He worked tirelessly in the re-
naming of 2nd Street in Silvis, Illinois to ‘‘Hero 
Street, USA’’ and establishing ‘‘Hero Street 
Memorial Park’’, a living memorial to the eight 
Mexican Americans from Hero Street and all 
the heroes from Silvis. I thank him for his life 
of service to his community and honor his leg-
acy. 
It is because of leaders such as Joe 
Terronez that I am especially proud to serve 
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally recog-
nize and honor the life of former Silvis Mayor, 
Joe Terronez.

IN MEMORY OF JOYCE C. HEARN 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, South Carolina cherishes the service 
of Joyce C. Hearn who was devoted to the 
citizens of South Carolina. She served as the 
Campaign Manager for the late Chairman 
Congressman Floyd Spence and was crucial 
in building the new Republican Party with no 
elected Republicans, which in 2020 estab-
lished the largest Republican majorities at all 
levels of government in 140 years. 
JOYCE C. HEARN 
[Jan. 20, 2021] 
COLUMBIA, 
SOUTH
CAROLINA.—A 
family 
only graveside service for Joyce C. Hearn 
will be held at 2:00 p.m. Sunday, January 31, 
2021, at Elmwood Cemetery. There will also 
be a livestream of the service on Dunbar Fu-
neral 
Home—Devine’s 
Facebook 
page: 
www.facebook.com/DunbarDevine. 
The 
Honorable 
Joyce 
C. 
Hearn 
died 
Wednesday. 
January 
20, 
2021. 
Born 
in 
Cedartown, Georgia, she was the daughter of 
the late J.C. Camp and Carolyn Carter Camp. 
At age 16, she enrolled at West Georgia Col-
lege, where she met her future husband, 
Thomas H. Hearn. She transferred to the 
University of Georgia and graduated with a 
Bachelors in Education from Ohio State Uni-
versity. After graduation, they moved to Co-
lumbia, South Carolina, where she taught at 
Eau Claire High School. 
She was most proud of her service to the 
people of South Carolina. She entered public 
life working with the 1970 Census, rising 
through the ranks to become both North and 
South Carolina’s Director of the U.S. Census. 
She was active in the S. C. Republican Party 
until her retirement in 2015, working tire-
lessly to elect Republicans. She championed 
every 
Republican 
presidential 
candidate 
from Barry Goldwater to George W. Bush. 
She was involved in every aspect of elec-
tive life. She began as a party volunteer in 
Richland County; by 1972, she was Chair of 
the Richland County Republican Party. 
From there she went into elective office, rep-
resenting District 76 in the South Carolina 
Legislature from 1975 to 1990. In her first 
race, she was described by The State news-
paper as a ‘‘housewife’’ who was just running 
as a placeholder until a real candidate could 
be found. But she was never a placeholder. In 
subsequent elections, The State described 
her victories as ‘‘landslides’’ or once, when 
she had a 40% lead over a local attorney, an 
‘‘earthquake.’’ 
For years, Representative Hearn was the 
only woman in the S. C. Legislature, but she 
was always a force that could not be over-
looked. Well respected by her peers, she was 
named assistant minority leader from 1976 to 
1978 and 1987–1989. From that position she 
worked tirelessly to protect the rights of 
crime victims. Her work to expand the pros-
ecution of rape to include degrees of crimi-
nal sexual assault has changed the way the 
South Carolina public views rape, giving 
hope to all victims of domestic violence. 
In 1990, Gov. Carroll Campbell appointed 
Representative Hearn to be Chairman of the 
Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission. 
Afterwards, at a time when many of her col-
leagues were retiring, she began a second ca-
reer in public relations with her own com-
pany Hearn & Associates, until her final re-
tirement in 2014. 
She was a woman of many interests. She 
was a founder of the National Order of 
Women Legislators, which to this day pro-
vides a national forum for women’s net-
working across all state legislatures. In 1979, 
Gov. Edwards awarded her the Order of the 
Palmetto for her many contributions to 
South Carolina. She was active in many di-
verse organizations, such as the Boards of 
the Columbia Urban League, the Federation 
of the Blind, Columbia College, and many 
others. 
She also served on the board of the Colum-
bia Museum. Many associations named her 
Legislator of the Year; the Association of Al-
cohol and Drug Abuse, the S.C. Association 
of Disabled Citizens, and the S.C. Committee 
on Sexual Assault, to name a few. She re-
ceived the 1985 Mothers Against Drunk Driv-
ing Distinguished Service Award for her 
work regarding Open Containers and raising 
the drinking age to 21. Representative Hearn 
served as chairman of the National Advisory 
Commission on Occupational Safety and 
Health. 
First and foremost, she loved her family; 
she was a devoted mother and grandmother, 
always there in time of need. She also loved 
golfing at Fripp Island (she was an avid fan 
of Tiger Woods) and playing Bridge with her 
friends. She was a jokester and highly com-
petitive, making every game fun for all. She 
was a winner at everything she did. 
Representative Hearn was a member of 
Kathwood Baptist Church and a Sunday 
school regular. 
Surviving are her daughters, Terri Hearn 
Bailey (Joseph Stan), Kimberly H. Johnson 
of Columbia, and C. Lee Hearn Becker (Karl) 
of Manassas, VA. She has six grandchildren, 
Carter Reston Potts, Joyce Carolyn ‘‘Josie’’ 
Bailey 
(Sudesh 
Kalyanswamy), 
Ruth 
Elisabeth ‘‘Lisa’’ Bailey, and Sarah Hearn 
Bailey, as well as Jason Thomas Becker and 
Daniel Gustav Becker. She was so looking 
forward to Sarah’s upcoming marriage to 
Christopher Michael Siercks on February 13. 
In addition to her parents, she was pre-
deceased by her husband, Thomas Harry 
Hearn.

VETERAN OF THE MONTH—TERRY 
HILL 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the First District of Oklahoma’s January Vet-
eran of the Month, Terry Hill. 
A Medical Evacuation Pilot in the United 
States Army, Terry Hill honorably served our 
nation for thirteen years. Upon returning home 
from service, Terry started Rapid Application 
Group, an Engineering and Advanced Manu-
facturing Company centered around Additive 
Manufacturing Technology. 
During his service in the United States 
Army, Hill was involved with several life saving 
missions and led his fellow soldiers diligently. 
He is the recipient of the Meritorious Service 
Medal, Order of Saint Michael, and he is a re-
cipient of the General McArthur Award for 
Leadership Representative. In addition, his 
company is a two-time recipient of the AAAA 
Aviation Maintenance Company of the Year 
award. Through his service, he demonstrated 
the highest levels of integrity, moral character, 
and servant leadership. 
In addition to starting Rapid Application 
Groupd, Hill founded the RAG Friday Founda-
tion, a non-profit organization that offers vet-
erans support and job training to help the tran-
sition into civilian life. He answered the call to 
defend freedom across the globe and sac-
rificed whatever was necessary in the name of 
that noble cause. It is my honor to recognize 
Terry Hill as the 1st Congressional District of 
Oklahoma’s January Veteran of the Month.

COMMENDING AND THANKING THE 
VIRGINIA NATIONAL GUARD FOR 
THEIR SERVICE 
HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to express my sincere appreciation 
for the Virginia National Guard—especially 
those from Virginia’s Seventh Congressional 
District. Members of the Virginia National 
Guard serve their country and their commu-
nities on a daily basis. Over the past months, 
the Virginia National Guard has deployed with 
little notice and often for longer than originally 
expected. I want to thank and honor the Vir-
ginia National Guard for its expeditious de-
ployment after the violent, deadly attack on 
the United States Capitol and assault on 
American democracy on January 6, 2021 and 
for their service since then to maintain secu-
rity. Members of the Virginia National Guard 
also played a key role in protecting an essen-
tial American tradition—the peaceful transfer 
of power. I truly appreciate the members of 
the Virginia National Guard for their service 
before, during, and after the Inauguration of 
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. as the 46th President of 
the United States and KAMALA D. HARRIS as 
the 49th Vice President of the United States. 
The Virginia National Guard’s willingness 
and readiness to serve is particularly appre-
ciated given the existing, significant strains on 
the Guard and on all Virginians. In addition to 
their service in Washington, D.C., I would like 
to recognize and honor the Virginia National 
Guard’s instrumental role in assisting with the 
COVID–19 response in the Commonwealth as 
well as its continuing training and deployment 
schedules. We must all recognize that the Vir-
ginia National Guard has continued to serve 
the United States overseas, and continued to 
prepare for forthcoming needs, while also de-
ploying to serve American communities during 
a global pandemic and serve our nation in the 
face of threats at home. Additionally, we can-
not overlook the commitment and contributions 
not only of the members of the Guard them-
selves, but also of their families, employers, 
and communities who make their service pos-
sible.

CONGRATULATING WHBF–TV FOR 
BEING NAMED 2020 MEDIUM MAR-

BY 
THE 
ILLINOIS 
BROAD-
CASTERS ASSOCIATION 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize WHBF–TV for being named 2020 
Medium Market TV Station of the Year by the 
Illinois Broadcasters Association. 
The Illinois Broadcasters Association is the 
leading advocate for the broadcast industry in 
Illinois and is engaged in shaping public policy 
to create a positive legislative and regulatory 
environment for its members. They award TV 
stations who are the best at what they do, and 
they have named WHBF–TV the best of the 
medium market TV stations in Illinois. As a 
former journalist, I understand the importance 
of local media and the prestige carried by this 
award. I commend WHBF–TV for the work 
that they do to inform the public and create a 
positive work environment. 
It is because of community leaders such as 
WHBF–TV that I am especially proud to serve 
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate WHBF–TV for receiving the 2020 
Medium Market TV Station of the Year Award.

MS. 
BRIANA 
MCCREARY 
AS 
THE 
ESCAMBIA 
COUNTY, FLORIDA TEACHER OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Ms. Briana McCreary as the Escambia 
County Teacher of the Year. For eight years, 
Ms. McCreary has served Montclair Elemen-
tary School with talent, passion, and an un-
wavering commitment to serving her students. 
In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to 
have some of the best teachers in the Nation. 
It is recognized that the teaching profession is 
one of the most difficult yet rewarding profes-
sions in existence. Ms. McCreary has per-
formed her teaching duties exceptionally, while 
also being an active and supportive member 
of her community. 
Ms. McCreary attended Florida A&M Univer-
sity, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in 
Elementary Education. She later attended the 
University of West Florida and earned a Mas-
ter of Arts in Educational Leadership. 
Her support and outreach extend far beyond 
the walls of her classroom through her in-
volvement in outreach programs, such as 
SheCounts. Ms. McCreary has served as the 
Director of this afterschool program since Au-
gust of 2019. The program is for female stu-
dents in grades three through five and is fo-
cused on improving their confidence and skills 
in mathematics and STEM courses. I com-
mend her for her steadfast willingness to 
serve those that matter most—the students 
and youth of our Nation. 
For all of her admirable contributions to our 
community, I am truly proud to have Ms. 
McCreary as a constituent in Florida’s First 
Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Ms. Briana McCreary for her many accom-
plishments, and her commitment to excel-
lence, professionalism, innovation, and col-
laboration in the Escambia County School Dis-
trict. I thank her for her service, and wish her 
all the best for her continued success.

OF 
THE 
99TH 
BIRTHDAY OF ETHEL KLEPIEN 
CISZEWICZ 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ethel Klepien Ciszewicz on 
the occasion of her 99th birthday. 
Mrs. Ciszewicz was born on January 27, 
1922. She was raised in Detroit, Michigan by 
her mother who worked to provide for Ethel 
and her three siblings after her father passed 
away when she was four years old. As a 
young woman, she loved to dance and would 
take the streetcar two to three times per week 
to take part in dances at Detroit’s famous 
dance halls. 
During World War II Ethel worked at 
Woodall Industries as a bucker in the welding 
process for airplane cowlings. As a Rosie the 
Riveter, Ethel’s hard work, grit, and patriotism 
not only sustained the American war effort, but 
paved a path for the next generation of work-
ing women. Ethel’s service to our country did 
not stop once she left the factory. At the end 
of the war as soldiers were returning home to 
their jobs, she joined the US Army Women’s 
Army Corps where she rose to the rank of 
Sargent. 
After the war ended, she married John who 
served in the Navy and together they had 
three children. After employment at various 
factories, the joy she found in cleaning led her 
to become a housekeeper at the Georgian Inn 
in Roseville, where she worked for a decade. 
At the Inn, her outstanding work ethic made 
her highly requested among guests. A proud 
Rosie, even now she has remained an active 
member of our community. Ethel’s lifelong 
commitment to service reminds us all of the 
impact that the Rosies have had on our state 
and nation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me 
today 
in 
celebrating 
Ethel 
Klepien 
Ciszewicz on her 99th birthday. I join with 
Ethel’s family and friends in extending my best 
and warmest wishes to her on this special 
day. I am proud to honor her life, her accom-
plishments, and her invaluable contributions to 
our nation.

HONORING AND RECOGNIZING 
LARRY SPENCE 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize Larry Spence as he re-
tires as sheriff of Willacy County. 
Sheriff Spence’s interest in law enforcement 
began at an early age in his hometown of 
Clinton, Indiana where he was a patrol boy, 
and culminated in his service to the safety and 
security of over 20,000 fellow Texans. 
In 1966 he joined the Air Force and served 
on its police force in California, Illinois and 
South Vietnam, where he helped secure his 
base during the Tet Offensive. After he re-
turned home in 1968, he took a job as a pa-
trolman in his hometown of Clinton and mar-
ried Maria Reyes, a Raymondville Texas na-
tive with whom he had a son, Gary. After six

years with the Clinton Police Department, he 
moved his family to South Texas and rose 
through the ranks. He was named deputy 
sheriff on June 1, 1976 and became sheriff of 
Willacy County on Jan. 1, 1985, a position to 
which he was re-elected nine consecutive 
times. During his tenure, he fostered a strong 
sense of consistency and security in the com-
munity. 
Sheriff Spence received numerous awards 
throughout his career, including the Silver Star 
for Bravery and the J. Edgar Hoover Award for 
Distinguished Police Service. He also received 
an invitation from President Ronald Reagan to 
attend the White House Conference for a 
Drug-Free America to honor his work in 
Texas’ War on Drugs. An example of Sheriff 
Spence’s honorable actions while on duty in-
clude his successful deescalation of a union 
strike in 1979 when he was just a deputy offi-
cer: he heroically placed himself between two 
individuals and singlehandedly prevented a 
potentially fatal incident. 
Sheriff Spence will be deeply missed by the 
many people in South Texas that he helped 
protect over the last 35 years. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating Sheriff Larry Spence’s years of service 
and dedication to the people of Willacy Coun-
ty, and wish him an enjoyable retirement and 
all the best in his future endeavors.

CONGRATULATING WRMJ ON RE-
CEIVING THE 2020 SMALL MAR-

STATION

THE 
YEAR 
AWARD 
FROM 
THE 
ILLINOIS 
BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate WRMJ for receiving the 2020 
Small Market Station of the Year Award from 
the Illinois Broadcasters Association. 
The Illinois Broadcasters Association is the 
leading advocate for the broadcast industry in 
Illinois and is engaged in shaping public policy 
to create a positive legislative and regulatory 
environment for its members. Through their 
Silver Dome Awards, the Illinois Broadcasters 
Association recognized WRMJ’s broadcasting 
excellence in TV, distinguishing WRMJ as one 
the best of the small market TV stations in Illi-
nois. This award is a well-deserved honor, and 
as a former journalist, I commend the hard 
work they do to keep the public informed. 
I would also like to congratulate Jim Taylor, 
WRMJ’s News & Sports Director, who re-
ceived the Illinois Broadcasters Association’s 
Best News Reporter and Best Sportscaster 
Award. His dedication and love for our com-
munity does not go unnoticed. 
It is because of community leaders such as 
WRMJ that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate WRMJ for winning the 2020 Small 
Market Station of the Year Award. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
POLICE 
HOME 
RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Police Home 
Rule Act, which would repeal the President’s 
authority to federalize the local District of Co-
lumbia police department, the Metropolitan Po-
lice Department (MPD). I am very pleased that 
Congresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY, Chair of 
the Committee on Oversight and Reform, 
which has jurisdiction over this bill, is an origi-
nal cosponsor. The President has no authority 
to federalize any other local or state police de-
partment. Under the Home Rule Act, ‘‘when-
ever the President . . . determines that spe-
cial conditions of an emergency nature exist 
which require the use of the [MPD] for Federal 
purposes, he may direct the Mayor to provide 
him, and the Mayor shall provide, such serv-
ices of the [MPD] as the President may deem 
necessary and appropriate.’’ 
Under the section of the Home Rule Act that 
would be repealed by this bill, the President 
may federalize MPD for a period of not more 
than 30 days, unless a resolution passed by 
Congress extending such federalization is en-
acted into law. Congress may also terminate 
the federalization at any time by enacting a 
resolution into law. This bill is necessary, even 
with these protections, because, under the 
principle of self-government, the President 
should not have control over the District’s local 
police department. 
While it does not appear that a President 
has exercised this authority over MPD, this la-
tent power is totally unnecessary, should not 
exist and is an affront to MPD, which has al-
ways voluntarily assisted federal authorities. 
Given the events at Lafayette Square this 
summer, it is imperative that no President be 
allowed to federalize MPD. Although President 
Trump did not federalize MPD this summer, 
we understand the administration looked into 
the possibility. MPD’s first responsibility is to 
protect District residents and visitors, and it 
must always remain under the authority of the 
D.C. mayor to accomplish its mission. More-
over, federalization is outdated in light of cur-
rent practice. MPD regularly assists the fed-
eral government as a matter of comity and to 
protect the District, not as an aim of the fed-
eral government, just as I am sure other local 
police departments do in the region. There are 
approximately 30 federal police departments 
under the President’s control in the District. In 
the case of a federal emergency, the Presi-
dent can unilaterally deploy these federal offi-
cers, as well as the D.C. National Guard, and 
can also request the support of MPD, as the 
President would do in any other jurisdiction, 
and as the Capitol Police did during the attack 
on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. 
This is an important step to increase home 
rule for the District, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this bill. 
IN MEMORY OF RICHARD TYLER 
HOOK 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, South Carolina has lost a Favorite 
Son with the tragic death of Richard Tyler 
Hook, age 25. His obituary clearly explains his 
extraordinary accomplishments and his be-
loved appreciation by all who knew him. The 
Wilson Family will always treasure his loyalty 
and devotion. 
RICHARD TYLER HOOK 
[Jan. 20, 2021] 
LEXINGTON, 
SOUTH
CAROLINA.—Richard 
Tyler Hook, the son of Richard and Kristin 
(Wingard) Hook, passed away on January 20, 
2021. Tyler was born and raised in Lexington, 
South Carolina and leaves a far-flung com-
munity of family and friends who will re-
member his rare talent to be both the ‘‘life 
of the party’’ as well as one of the most 
thoughtful and considerate people you could 
find. 
Upon graduating from Lexington High 
School. Tyler attended Newberry College, 
where he was a two-term President of his 
fraternity, Kappa Alpha Order. A well-loved 
figure on the campus. Tyler was also voted 
Kappa Delta sorority’s ‘‘Beau,’’ and he fond-
ly recalled his years at Newberry College as 
some of the best years in his life. He grad-
uated from Newberry College in 2017 with a 
Bachelor of Science in Business Administra-
tion and Digital Marketing. 
After graduation, Tyler served as a staffer 
for various campaigns, including campaign 
staffer for the Republican Party of Virginia, 
the campaign to re-elect S.C. Attorney Gen-
eral Alan Wilson, and the campaign manager 
of the Christian Stegmaier S.C. Senate cam-
paign. Tyler then served former Virginia 
House Delegate Ben Cline’s successful con-
gressional bid for the 6th Congressional Dis-
trict of Virginia, where he was instrumental 
in leading the campaign to a first term con-
gressional victory. He went on to work on 
the staff of U.S. Representative Ben Cline of 
Virginia in Washington D.C. A budding polit-
ico, Tyler graduated from The George Wash-
ington University in 2020 with a Master of 
Arts in Media and Strategic Communication. 
When he was not out on the campaign trail 
or roaming the halls of the Capitol, one 
could find Tyler on the golf course, or with 
his family at Williams-Brice Stadium cheer-
ing on the Gamecocks. From a young age, 
Tyler’s family encouraged his natural curi-
osity through travel. Tyler’s family trips 
took him all over the country and to many 
sites, including many museums up and down 
the east coast and Europe. He had a love of 
music. When he was six-years old, he experi-
enced his first concert with his parents at-
tending a Madonna concert in Boston. After 
his high-school graduation, Tyler traveled 
throughout Europe with his aunt Gwyn 
Wingard, where he saw the Rolling Stones in 
concert and fell in love with Scotland and all 
things Scottish. His Aunt Gwyn has fond 
memories of Tyler charming the ladies on 
his tour across Great Britain. 
However far his travels and work took 
him, Tyler remained incredibly close to his 
family, from whom he learned how to make 
sweet tea and pork chops the ‘‘right way’’ 
like a true Southerner. 
Tyler’s family and friends recall an uncom-
monly generous and kind young man whose 
gift of wit charmed all who knew him. He is 
survived by his parents, Richard and Kristin

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
BLAKE HURST 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate my dear friend, 
Blake Hurst, on his recent retirement as presi-
dent of the Missouri Farm Bureau. Blake was 
first elected as the 14th president of Missouri 
Farm Bureau on December 7, 2010. His prior 
service with the organization included being a 
district board member on the Missouri state 
board for eight years and serving seven years 
as Missouri Farm Bureau vice president. 
Blake, and his wife Julie, raise corn and soy-
beans in Northwest Missouri and they also op-
erate a wholesale greenhouse business. They 
are blessed with 3 children and 6 grand-
children. 
Looking back on Blake’s years of service, 
what particularly stands out is his resolve in 
leading the entire Missouri Farm Bureau orga-
nization in responding to and working through 
claims from the catastrophic tornado that 
struck Joplin, Missouri, on the evening of Sun-
day, May 22, 2011. Blake and the whole Mis-
souri Farm Bureau organization showed great 
courage during that difficult time. 
Founded in 1915, Missouri was the first 
state Farm Bureau in America, and during 
Blake’s tenure Missouri Farm Bureau cele-
brated 100 years as an organization. Other 
accomplishments that Blake can be proud of 
include helping with the passage of Missouri’s 
Freedom to Farm, the final rule defining 
Waters of the United States, and the passage 
of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment. Blake even showcased his skilled danc-
ing maneuvers in a video supporting the 
USMCA. 
Blake is well-respected by rural communities 
and agricultural leaders in the state of Mis-
souri. Blake is also a freelance writer. His 
work has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, 
The American, Weekly Standard, Wilson’s 
Quarterly, Reader’s Digest, Today’s Farmer 
and the Show Me magazine of Missouri Farm 
Bureau. Mr. Hurst has excelled at telling the 
story of agriculture in America, and he has ex-
celled in fighting to conserve the rural way of 
life. I am proud to call Blake my friend and I 
think it’s safe to say his time at Missouri Farm 
Bureau will serve as a legacy for generations 
to come.

RECOGNIZING 
BOB 
WATSON 
ON 
THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIM AC-
QUIRING THE CARROLL COUNTY 
MIRROR-DEMOCRAT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 1, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the ac-
quiring of the Carroll County Mirror-Democrat 
by Bob Watson on November 19, 1980. Bob’s 
lifelong goal was to acquire and operate the 
Carroll County Mirror-Democrat because his 
father, Thomas A. Watson, and his mother, 
Grace, purchased the Mirror-Democrat in 1950 
and ran it until 1962. The Watson family has 
been personally connected to the Carroll 
County Mirror-Democrat for 70 years. 
Bob was raised in Mount Carroll, Illinois, 
and graduated from Mount Carroll High School 
in 1968. After earning a bachelor’s degree in 
Journalism from Northern Illinois University in 
1972, he spent eight years working for weekly 
and daily newspapers in Northwestern Illinois. 
Thomas Sr. and Grace Watson ran the Mirror- 
Democrat from 1950 until Thomas Sr. passed 
away in 1962. The newspaper was sold in 
1963, and did not become available for pur-
chase again until autumn of 1980, when Bob 
was able to acquire it. On April 1, 1990, he 
also purchased the Savanna Times-Journal. 
His wife, Paula, who is a retired grade-school 
teacher, and Bob are the co-publishers of the 
Mirror-Democrat. They are very proud of their 
son, Thomas R., who is a graduate of the Col-
lege of Business at the University of Illinois, 
Champaign-Urbana and is employed by a 
large marketing and advertising company in 
Chicago. They maintain offices in downtown 
Mount Carroll and Savanna, publishing both 
weekly newspapers with a talented, veteran 
staff of four employees. As a former journalist, 
I admire their dedication to journalism and the 
determination they demonstrate across gen-
erations. 
It is because of leaders such as Bob Wat-
son that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally congratulate Bob 
Watson for 40 years of owning the Mirror- 
Democrat.

tem for a computerized schedule of all 
meetings and hearings of Senate com-
mittees, subcommittees, joint commit-
tees, and committees of conference. 
This title requires all such committees 
to notify the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest—designated by the Rules Com-
mittee—of the time, place and purpose 
of the meetings, when scheduled and 
any cancellations or changes in the 
meetings as they occur. 
As an additional procedure along 
with the computerization of this infor-
mation, the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest will prepare this information for 
printing in the Extensions of Remarks 
section of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
on Monday and Wednesday of each 
week. 
Meetings scheduled for Tuesday, Feb-
ruary 2, 2021 may be found in the Daily
