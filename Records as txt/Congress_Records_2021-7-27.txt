USE TRUMP POLICIES TO 
CONTROL BORDER CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MURPHY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today, I rise to speak on the 
tragedy that is facing our Nation in 
the opioid epidemic. 
As a physician for over 30 years, 
there is nothing more important to me 
than the health and safety of our com-
munities. Unfortunately, it is no secret 
that communities across this great Na-
tion are suffering from an opioid crisis 
that is sweeping the country once 
again. 
As a member of the North Carolina 
General Assembly, I worked tirelessly 
on legislation to help curb the number 
of overdose deaths that were occurring 
in our State. After three decades of 
climbing statistics of young people 
dying from overdoses, we effected a 
change, and that number started to de-
crease. We did this by decreasing the 
number of prescribed opioids. 
However, 
tragically 
enough, 
that 
number has started to rise again. That 
is because the illicit fentanyls have 
now taken over the death market. 
Last year alone, more than 93,000 
Americans died of drug overdoses, 
which demonstrates a 30 percent in-
crease from 2019. Of the 93,000 drug-re-
lated overdoses last year, 69 percent 
were opioid-related. 
According to the CDC, last year, the 
tragic surge in these deaths is attrib-
uted largely to the illicit fentanyls. 
People know that, medically speaking, 
fentanyl is one of the most lethal sub-
stances on the planet. In fact, 2 milli-
grams can be considered a lethal dose. 
Since Biden and HARRIS flung open 
our southern border, illicit drugs have 
poured into this country in record 
numbers. We no longer control our 
southern border; the Mexican drug car-
tels do. They love the fact the border 
has now been opened, and they have 
free rein to bring their death and de-
struction into this country. 
Fentanyl has quickly become the 
drug of choice for these cartels. It is 
cheap, easy to manufacture, and highly 
profitable. Fentanyl is easy to smuggle 
in small amounts, and it is easier for 
drug mules to bring it across our po-
rous southern border. 
Its toxicity means that those pur-
chasing this deadly opioid need only a 
small amount to cause death or serious 
harm. 
There is a strong correlation between 
border crossings and high drug encoun-
ters, with no help coming from the 
White House. 
Last month, Customs and Border 
Protection seized a record 1,060 pounds 
of fentanyl. That represents a higher 
total than the last three Junes com-
bined. That 1-month seizure alone was 
enough drugs to kill 240 million people. 
Think about it. Those are only the 
drugs that we catch. It is obvious from 
what is happening on the American 
streets that much more gets across the 
southern border. 
The Biden-Harris administration de-
nies this is a crisis. How can they do 
this to the American people? How do 
they not understand that this reckless-
ness is leading to death and destruc-
tion in their own country. 
At the same time, the Border Patrol 
encountered 188,000 illegal immigrants, 
so the hypocrisy continues. Thousands 
of people are coming into our country 
illegally, either not vaccinated or 
COVID-positive. Is anyone checking 
their status? But know if you come 
from Canada or another country, you 
have to prove you have been vac-
cinated—hypocrisy at the highest level 
coming from the White House, further 
death and destruction coming from the 
Biden-Harris administration. 
President 
Biden 
knows 
he 
has 
botched 
our 
border 
security. 
Vice 
President HARRIS only got shamed into 
going to the border when former Presi-
dent Trump was going. She finally did 
go to a sterile area for a good photo 
shoot and not to the real area of crisis. 
They decided that no action is better 
than acknowledging their role in cre-
ating this public health, humanitarian, 
and national security crisis. 
I am sorry, Mr. President and Mrs. 
Vice President, this is totally unac-
ceptable. You are causing irreparable 
harm to this Nation. 
In 2021, every community in this 
country is a border community. Mak-
ing our Nation safer starts at our bor-
ders, and we have a responsibility to

SUPPORTING UCLA’S QUARTER IN 
WASHINGTON PROGRAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BARRAGA´ N) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, as a 
young college student, I remember 
coming to Washington, D.C., to work 
at the White House. 
I was so inspired that, in 1999, I re-
turned to D.C. through UCLA’s Quarter 
in Washington Program. It was known 
as the CAPPP program, which stands 
for the Center of American Politics and 
Public Policy. 
This time, my internship experience 
was very different. The UCLA’s CAPPP 
program offered something unique, set-
ting it apart from most programs that 
focus only on internships. It had a re-
quired research seminar that intro-
duced me to serious original social re-
search and writing. There is no doubt 
that this program honed my skill set 
and challenged me with a major re-
search project. 
At UCLA, the classes were so big that 
I did not have a similar opportunity on 
campus. The program engaged and en-
couraged me to seriously explore pol-
icy questions of interest to me in a dis-
ciplined way. 
In fact, my research was on the issue 
of racial disparities in public health, a 
top priority of mine in Congress today. 
The rewards I derived from UCLA’s 
CAPPP Quarter in Washington pro-
gram have been shared by many others 
who have benefited. I have learned that 
since my time in the program, CAPPP 
has brought ever more diverse cohorts 
of students, especially women and stu-
dents of color. CAPPP demonstrated 
that top universities like UCLA can be 
competitive, excellent, and diverse at 
the same time. 
Every 
May, 
UCLA 
hosts 
Under-
graduate Research Week in its famed 
Pauley Pavilion. Over the past several 
years, CAPPP Quarter in Washington 
students 
have 
distinguished 
them-
selves, winning awards such as Dean’s 
Prizes and UCLA’s coveted Library 
Prize. 
The recent director, a former UCLA 
professor of mine, Professor James 
Desveaux, said that more students 
from this program—2,500 miles from 
Westwood—have 
participated 
in 
UCLA’s Undergraduate Research Con-
ference than from any other program 
or department in the social sciences or 
humanities. 
After graduation, CAPPP’s alumni 
have gone on to remarkable accom-
plishments. Just a few examples of 
CAPPP alumni: 
The top applicant to Yale Law 
School in 2018, now an editor at the 
Yale Law Journal. 
The daughter of Nigerian immigrants 
who grew up in low-income housing in 
Los Angeles was an English major at 
UCLA with zero training in the social 
sciences until the CAPPP program in 
Washington. Because of her research in 
Washington, she gained admission to 
the prestigious Ph.D. program at Har-
vard’s Chan School of Public Health in 
2020. 
Zachary Baron, oversight counsel for 
the House Committee on Ways and 
Means in this very Chamber. 
Addar Levi, the Deputy General 
Counsel for the U.S. Treasury Depart-
ment. 
The former deputy city attorney for 
San Francisco. 
And the list goes on and on. 
This 
program taught us critical 
thinking and research skills that have 
transformed our lives and set us up to 
make a real difference in the world. 
As an alumna, I join the UCLA 
CAPPP alumni group on Facebook. A 
few weeks ago, as I was reading my 
news feed, I got some stunning news: 
UCLA’s CAPPP program has been dis-
mantled. 
I read the former director’s farewell 
letter. The decision had nothing to do 
with COVID or funding shortages. The 
decision was made by a handful of ad-
ministrators who believe that having a 
research 
requirement 
as 
part 
of 
UCLA’s internship program in Wash-
ington is unnecessary. Students can do 
research on the campus, they insisted. 
For 31 years, UCLA’s CAPPP pro-
gram demonstrated success. There was 
always high demand from its students 
wanting to engage in research while in-
terning in Washington. Why deny them 
this opportunity? After all, aren’t re-
search universities supposed to be 
about teaching and research? 
As a product of UCLA’s CAPPP pro-
gram, I know its value firsthand. I be-
lieve the skills I learned and the re-
search I conducted had a role in get-
ting me where I am today. 
It truly saddens me to learn the pro-
gram is coming to an end. This seems 
contrary to the mission of the number 
one public research university. I hope 
that UCLA will reconsider and give 
students the opportunity to grow from 
this 
unique 
undergraduate 
oppor-
tunity.

RECOGNIZING AUSTIN SKERO 
UPON HIS RETIREMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. TONY GONZALES) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Del 
Rio Border Patrol Sector Chief Austin 
Skero, who is retiring from Border Pa-
trol at the end of July after a more 
than 30-year career in law enforcement. 
Chief Skero has honorably served 26 
years with Customs and Border Protec-
tion, beginning his career in 1995 in the 
Rio Grande Valley sector. Throughout 
his time with CBP, he has served Bor-
der Patrol in various roles across the 
Nation, from Washington, D.C., to 
Grand Forks, North Dakota. 
Chief Skero has led the Del Rio sec-
tor as chief since July 2020. He oversees 
250 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, su-
pervising 2,000 Border Patrol employ-
ees, 9 CBP stations, and 5 traffic check-
points, and supporting 47 counties in 
Texas. 
Chief Skero’s mission as sector chief 
has been especially challenging this 
year. Del Rio currently is the eye of 
the storm as we tackle this southern 
border crisis. Over the last year, Chief 
Skero has led Del Rio Border Patrol 
agents through one of the largest 
spikes in migrant traffic in United 
States history. 
This has been no easy task. Del Rio is 
the second most trafficked sector on 
the U.S.-Mexico border. Agents are ap-
prehending an average of a thousand 
migrants per day, some who surrender 
willingly and others who try their 
hardest to avoid being caught. 
Last month alone, Chief Skero’s sec-
tor saw over 30,000 migrant apprehen-
sions, a 700 percent increase from the 
previous year. In Del Rio, over 700 
human smuggling cases have been pros-
ecuted, and sex offender apprehensions 
are up 1,400 percent. 
Apprehensions on trains in Uvalde 
are up 900 percent, and it is estimated 
that cartels make $25 million a week in 
the Del Rio sector alone simply by 
trafficking people. 
When agents are not in the field se-
curing our borders, their dedicated 
work to ensure our migrants are pro-
tected has not gone unnoticed. Using 
the sector’s limited resources to deal 
with many dimensions of the crisis has 
shown exemplary leadership from Chief 
Skero. Chief Skero has met and sur-
passed those expectations. 
He has had the responsibility of brief-
ing political figures from every corner 
of the Nation and every party on what 
is happening at our southern border. 
I am incredibly grateful for Chief 
Skero’s leadership, especially during 
this historic and difficult time for our 
border communities and our Border Pa-
trol agents. His hard work and commit-
ment have not gone unnoticed. 
Chief Skero has received several 
awards and commendations throughout 
his career, including Border Patrol’s 
highest award for heroism and valor, 
the Newton-Azrak Award. While we 
will miss his direction and guidance, I 
know his retirement is more than well- 
earned. 
Chief Skero has lived a life driven by 
service to our community. The Del Rio 
border sector, our border communities, 
Texas, and our country are safer be-
cause of his leadership and work at the 
southern border. 
Angel and I wish him and his wife, 
Chandra, all the best as they enter this 
next phase of their life. 
I thank Chief Skero personally for all 
the direction and guidance he has given 
in this very difficult time. He has been 
at the forefront of this effort, at the

ENDING CHILD LABOR IN COCOA 
AND CHOCOLATE INDUSTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, it is 
time to discuss the steps we must take 
to end child labor in the cocoa and 
chocolate industry. 
This issue was brought to my atten-
tion by the students at Bell Elemen-
tary School in Chicago. Through the 
guidance of their teacher, Mr. Barash, 
these students learned the disturbing 
relationship between child labor and 
chocolate production. 
b 1015 
During my visit with their class, 
they shared with me their concern for 
children who are forced into child labor 
in this industry. Some of these chil-
dren are sold to traffickers or farm 
owners or are abducted only to be 
taken to cocoa farms for work. Some 
do not see their families again for 
years—some never again. 
Most children in the industry begin 
their days before the sun rises and end 
it long after the sun sets. They are 
forced to wield dangerous machetes 
while climbing up and down trees to 
cut down bean pods. Then they must 
carry the pods in sacks weighing more 
than 100 pounds through the forest. If 
the children don’t work fast enough, 
the farm owners beat them. When they 
are finally able to rest, they must sleep 
on wooden planks in small, windowless 
buildings with little or no access to 
clean water. 
Many of these children will never at-
tend school or receive an education. 
The passionate elementary schoolers 
who told me about this made the com-
pelling case that we must eradicate 
child labor from this industry and 
make sure these children are no longer 
forced into dangerous, unlawful work-
ing conditions. 
How can we justify all of this for the 
sake of chocolate? 
I am not the first Member of this 
body to be concerned about these prac-
tices. This fight was first taken up in 
Congress 
by 
former 
Representative 
Eliot Engel of New York who worked 
to establish a labeling standard to indi-
cate on chocolate products that no 
child labor had been used in its produc-
tion. 
While this effort did not succeed, he 
was joined by former Senator Tom Har-
kin to establish what we call the Har-
kin-Engel Protocol. This protocol was 
an agreement between governments, 
chocolate companies, and cocoa pro-
ducers to eliminate the worst forms of 
child labor within cocoa production. 
While the protocol has been effective, 
this problem persists. In 2015, 14 years 
after the protocol’s signing, the De-
partment of Labor reported that more 
than 2 million children were engaged in 
child labor in cocoa growing regions of 
West Africa. Although the chocolate 
industry made a promise to end child 
labor almost 20 years ago, today, no 
company can guarantee their products 
are free of child labor. While chocolate 
producers have shown some concern for 
the lives of these children through 
dedicated funding to eradicate child 
labor in their industry, it has simply 
not been enough. 
The three largest chocolate suppliers 
in the world are not even able to iden-
tify the farms where their cocoa is 
being produced. As Americans, we must 
recognize that much of the chocolate 
we enjoy is harvested and produced at 
the expense of these young children. 
We cannot let this continue. Kids 
should be in schools. Kids should be 
playing. Kids should be with friends. 
Kids should be kids. 
After speaking with the children at 
Bell Elementary, I was proud to take 
the first step in the Labor-HHS and 
Education appropriations bill by in-
cluding language to reinvigorate the 
Department of Labor’s role in the 
international Child Labor Cocoa Co-
ordinating Group and to hold the com-
panies in countries involved account-
able for the promises they made almost 
20 years ago under the Harkin-Engel 
Protocol. But there is still much to do. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in Congress and Secretary 
Walsh to bring an end to child labor in 
the cocoa industry. I also want to ac-
knowledge the amazing 12 and 13 year 
olds who brought this to my attention 
and are fighting for children they don’t 
know halfway across the world. Stand-
ing with these students and working to 
further their mission is why I am proud 
to be a Member of this body: to ensure 
that students like this have their 
voices heard by Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to going 
back to Chicago and the Bell Elemen-
tary students to tell them that Con-
gress is listening. 
f 
FOREST MANAGEMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, it has 
been obvious for years now that we 
need to rethink our forest management 
strategies. 
2020 was the worst fire season on 
record for California and much of the 
West. California alone saw 4.2 million 
acres of land burned. Currently, there 
are 85 large fires burning across the 
West and already 11⁄2
million acres 
burnt. 
Last week the smoke reached all the 
way 
to 
Washington, 
D.C., 
causing 
health advisories for people not to be 
outside if they either have health 
issues or for athletic purposes in D.C. 
and 
Baltimore. 
The 
plume 
even 
reached all the way up to New York. 
The U.S. Forest Service and the De-
partment of the Interior have identi-
fied more than 80 million acres that are 
overgrown and at a high risk of fire. 
As wildfires burn across California 
and the West, Republicans have several 
bill proposals before this House that 
would improve forest management. 
These bills propose comprehensive so-
lutions to address the declining health 
of our forests and help prevent cata-
strophic wildfires by expediting the en-
vironmental analysis, reducing frivo-
lous lawsuits, and increasing the pace 
and scale of management practices. 
We have suppressed fires for over 110 
years which is okay on the surface, but 
now most forests are intensely over-
stocked and overgrown with the fuel 
that causes the fires because we didn’t 
do the other side of the coin: the har-
vest work, the treatment, and the re-
moving of materials. 
For example, in California most for-
est types had in the past about 64 trees 
per acre in the mid-1800s. Now they sit 
at over 300 trees per acre or more, caus-
ing weak trees that are more suscep-
tible to insects and ultimately death 
because they don’t have enough water 
supply, and so this in itself exacerbates 
the drought within the forest with all 
the competition of trees per acre and 
the death of the trees themselves. 
One of my bills, the CLEAR Zones 
Act, 
would 
allow 
better 
clearing 
around power lines. It would allow a 
wider buffer to prevent trees from fall-
ing on the lines and igniting a fire 
which is what they do. A tree falling 
into power lines lately was likely the 
cause of the Dixie fire, currently the 
largest fire burning in California. So 
far it has burned right around 200,000 
acres in my district, and it is only 22 
percent contained. 
This is hitting the area north of the 
Camp fire that burned in 2018. As you 
might remember from history, Mr. 
Speaker, it burned the town of Para-
dise, part of Magalia, Concow, and Yan-
kee Hill, this large area here. 
Then following up in 2020 was the 
North Complex fire. They are burning 
up against each other basically over 
history here. And now we have the 
Dixie fire, as it is known, along with a 
smaller one called the Fly fire which 
have burned together. Pretty soon the 
whole landscape is going to have a his-
tory of having burned. 
For what reason? 
It is because we won’t manage the 
lands. We won’t do what needs to be 
done to put the kind of buffers and the 
kind of zones in that would help make 
it easier for the firefighters. 
Well, the solutions we do have are: 
we have proper forest management. We 
have seen that in this area here, 
around this current Dixie fire. 
The Collins Pine Company based in 
Chester, California, and a lot of areas 
in northern California, has done a lot 
of free work along highways around the 
community that would be very, very 
helpful and ultimately will be very 
helpful towards the type of manage-
ment that will make us fire-safe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3914 
July 27, 2021 
The thinning that is done along the 
highways and around the towns is what 
has made it possible for the firefighters 
in a very difficult situation—on the 
just seen Dixie fire, on my map there— 
to have a chance to stop this fire fi-
nally. It has ravaged so much, and they 
have done an amazing job of protecting 
communities and homes in those areas. 
But it has turned from a fire where a 
tree hit a power line—we are still wait-
ing for the forensic report on that— 
from a small, half-acre fire and just a 
couple weeks later 200,000 acres and all 
this endangerment. 
So work that had been done pre-
viously by Collins Pine is going to 
probably save the day for the town of 
Chester and others up in that direc-
tion. 
So if we dramatically increase the 
fuel treatments across all these land-
scapes, then it gives us a fighting 
chance. We need to thin the forest and 
return low-intensity fire to these land-
scapes in the form also of a prescribed 
fire at a time of year when we can con-
trol them. The Native Americans used 
to use this method, and we can learn 
from them. 
This map of fuels treatment projects 
around 
the 
Whiskeytown 
National 
Recreation Area, overlaid with the sat-
ellite image of the 2018 Carr fire burn 
scar, shows that where the fuels were 
managed the fire was less intense. The 
green area has been highlighted to 
show a better contrast. The areas that 
had been thinned did not burn nearly 
as intensely. Instead, the big trees sur-
vived, the fire goes through the area at 
the bottom of the forest much more 
slowly, and it is much more manage-
able. The upper areas are the ones that 
burned to a crisp. 
So this map shows that forest man-
agement 
works 
and 
that 
thinning 
works. We need to increase the pace 
and scale of this type of project so 
when fires come, the landscape is 
ready, and it doesn’t endanger our fire-
fighters and our communities unneces-
sarily. 
Fire will happen. It is going to hap-
pen whether it is a manmade accident 
or nature with lightning strikes and 
the things that happen there. It is 
going to happen. 
But what are we going to do to ad-
dress that? 
If we want to talk about change of 
temperatures and the drought situa-
tion we are facing in the West, we have 
to do even more to address overgrown 
forests and the amount of inventory 
per acre a forest can handle. Basically, 
all these trees in an overloaded forest 
are called ladder fuels. The fires will be 
lower intensity if we do the right work. 
They are easier to put out and much 
less devastating. Indeed, it is the nat-
ural landscape we used to have over 100 
years ago when fire was actually con-
structive. 
TWENTY YEARS OF THE CLINTON 
FOUNDATION HEADQUARTERS IN 
HARLEM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 20-year anniversary 
of the Clinton Foundation opening its 
headquarters in Harlem, USA. For the 
past two decades, the Clinton Founda-
tion has been at the heart of the Har-
lem 
community, 
empowering 
local 
businesses and working to improve the 
neighborhood. This is, as you know, 
Mr. Speaker, an iconic neighborhood in 
the United States, and it is the center 
of the African diaspora in the United 
States, if not the world. 
Throughout their time in Harlem, 
the Clinton Foundation has helped fa-
cilitate the microfinancing of 136,000 
low-income women entrepreneurs. It 
has created sustainable models to help 
foster entrepreneurship, and it has un-
dertaken critical projects to address 
inequalities in this community. 
From 2002 to 2013, the foundation op-
erated the Clinton Economic Oppor-
tunity Initiative, offering technical 
and managerial support to local entre-
preneurs. However, the work did not 
stop at the boundaries of Harlem. In 
fact, in 2013, the foundation expanded 
their mission of unlocking opportunity 
and addressing inequality across our 
country and the world. 
Due to the extraordinary work of the 
foundation, 430 million people in more 
than 180 countries have benefited from 
the Clinton Global Initiative. Twenty- 
one million people now have access to 
lifesaving HIV/AIDS medications, 1.2 
million children’s books have been dis-
tributed to under-resourced commu-
nities 
across 
the 
world, 
and 
71 
megawatts of clean energy projects 
have been facilitated in small island 
nations. 
In the face of the pandemic, the Clin-
ton Global Initiative also launched Ac-
tion Network which brings together 
leaders from business, government, and 
philanthropic sectors to take action 
and address inequalities facing histori-
cally excluded groups. 
Now, as we look to the challenges of 
the next 20 years, we know that the 
Clinton Foundation will continue to 
sharpen their focus on partnership 
building, expanding upon new horizons, 
and empowering more and more com-
munities. 
I want to commend the Clinton 
Foundation on their prodigious work of 
the past 20 years and their strong pres-
ence in the village of Harlem and 
thank former President Clinton and 
former Secretary Clinton for their con-
tinued dedication to furthering human-
ity and prioritizing historically ex-
cluded and underserved communities.

FREE CUBA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to talk to you about why it 
is important to me and why it should 
be important to the American people 
that we support those in Cuba who are 
fighting right now for their future, for 
their 
freedom, 
for 
democracy, 
for 
human rights, and for dignity. 
I am the daughter of a Cuban refugee. 
My mother came to this great country 
in 1959 to escape the oppression of the 
Castro regime. Sadly, my family had 
been split apart, and my grandfather 
had remained in Cuba to stay with his 
small businesses. He had two gas sta-
tions there, and the regime had come 
in and taken his businesses and his 
home. Unfortunately, my family never 
really reconnected. 
As we look at what is happening 
right now in this island that is just 90 
miles from our shore, it is incredibly 
important to note the role that Cuba 
has played in spreading communism 
and socialism throughout the Western 
Hemisphere. They have aligned them-
selves with the most dangerous na-
tions—our 
adversaries—across 
the 
world from Iran to China to Venezuela 
to Russia and to North Korea. Mr. 
Speaker, you see them all right now at 
this moment propping up this Com-
munist regime. 
b 1030 
We, the leader of the free world, must 
stand with the Cuban people at this 
moment. We have a moment in history 
that is very similar to what Ronald 
Reagan faced in 1987 with the Iron Cur-
tain. This is our Berlin Wall moment. 
The people in Cuba, my family in-
cluded, have suffered for six decades 
under a brutal murderous regime. 
Tens of thousands of people have died 
at the hands of the Castro brothers. 
Many, many more have been jailed and 
beaten simply for peacefully protesting 
communism and wanting to live in 
freedom. 
This regime has also played a very 
important 
role, 
unfortunately, 
in 
spreading communism in the Western 
Hemisphere, as I mentioned. We saw 
Venezuela, one of the richest nations in 
South America, be destroyed by Hugo 
Chavez, Nicolas Maduro, propped up by 
the Castro regime. We see it going into 
Nicaragua, Bolivia, and even here in 
the United States of America. 
And I can tell you, firsthand, in New 
York City, how painful it was to me to 
see the communist symbol, the ham-
mer and sickle, painted on our govern-
ment buildings last summer. If we end 
communism in Cuba, we end its spread 
in the Western Hemisphere. And that is 
what we as the American people, free-
dom-loving Americans, should be doing 
at this moment in time. 
And there is a reason why the Cuban 
people are marching in the streets 
right now holding the American flag. It 
is because we are that symbol of free-
dom, that beacon of hope and oppor-
tunity, and we must rise to the occa-
sion, garner support from our allies,

democracies from all around the world, 
to put pressure on this illegitimate re-
gime to exit. 
One last thing I want to address is 
the issue of what some of my col-
leagues say is the embargo. It is uncon-
scionable to me that we would have 
Members of Congress that would actu-
ally blame America for what is occur-
ring in Cuba. 
What people need to understand is 
they do business with nearly every 
country around the world, yet, nothing 
has changed in six decades. That is be-
cause everything that comes into this 
island, whether it is food, whether it is 
medicine, money, the regime takes it, 
and they use it to weaponize against 
their people. You either go along with 
their communist revolution or you get 
nothing, you starve. And that is the re-
ality. So lifting the embargo will only 
further prop up this regime. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the President, I 
urge my colleagues, and there are 
Democrats and Republicans who do 
support Cuba at this moment, and es-
pecially those of us who are of Cuban 
descent. Let’s have a Berlin moment 
here. Let’s make history together. We 
need to just do it by encouraging de-
mocracies from around the world to 
join us, and we need our leadership to 
be extremely strong at this moment. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Live free Cuba. We are with you. We 
hope to see liberty in Cuba soon. 
Viva Cuba libre. Estamos contigo. 
Espero que vemos libertad pronto. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York will provide 
a translation of her remarks to the 
Clerk. 
The Chair will remind all Members to 
maintain proper decorum in the Cham-

f 
RACIAL EQUITY IN AMERICA JOBS 
AND FAMILY PLAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, while 
the American Rescue Plan is changing 
the course of the pandemic and deliv-
ering relief for working families, this is 
no time to build back the way things 
were. We, in the Virgin Islands, can tell 
you that after suffering not one, but 
two Category 5 hurricanes in 2017. This 
is our moment to reimagine and re-
build a new economy. 
Let it be known, the American Jobs 
Plan is an investment in America, that 
it will create millions of good jobs, re-
build our country’s infrastructure, and 
position 
the 
United 
States 
to 
outcompete China and others. 
Public domestic investment, as a 
share of the economy, has fallen by 
more than 40 percent since the 1960s. 
The American Jobs Plan will invest in 
America in a way we have not invested 
since we built the interstate highways 
or won the Space Race. 
The United States of America is the 
wealthiest country in the world, yet we 
rank 13th when it comes to overall 
quality of our infrastructure. After 
decades of disinvestment, our roads, 
bridges, water systems are crumbling. 
Our electric grid is vulnerable to cata-
strophic outages. Too many lack af-
fordable, high speed internet, and qual-
ity housing. 
The past year has led to job losses 
and threaten economic security, erod-
ing more than 30 years of progress in 
women’s labor force participation. It 
has unmasked the fragility of our 
caregiving infrastructure. And our Na-
tion has fallen behind its biggest com-
petitors on research and development, 
manufacturing, and training. 
It has never been more important for 
us to invest in strengthening our infra-
structure and competitiveness, and in 
creating the good-paying union jobs of 
the future. 
Like great projects of the past, the 
President’s plan will unify and mobi-
lize our country to meet the great 
challenges of our time: the climate cri-
sis and ambitions of an autocratic 
China. It will invest in Americans and 
deliver jobs and opportunities we all 
deserve. 
But unlike past major investments, 
the plan also prioritizes addressing 
longstanding and persistent racial in-
justice. The plan targets 40 percent of 
the benefits of climate and clean infra-
structure investment to disadvantaged 
communities. The American Jobs and 
Family Plan assists in creating equity 
and wealth creation in communities of 
color, which helps all Americans. 
The American Jobs and Family Plan 
will transform transportation infra-
structure, addressing historic inequi-
ties, and increasing resilience. It will 
bring broadband coverage to 100 per-
cent while reducing costs, create jobs 
in renewable energy, revitalize our 
schools, veterans’ hospitals, and sup-
port our essential home care workers. 
The bill will strengthen financial se-
curity of working families through an 
increase in funding for key nutrition 
initiatives: SNAP, WIC, child nutri-
tion, 
rural 
development, 
including 
broadband, rental, and other housing 
initiatives, and access to healthcare. 
This will ensure a clean, affordable, 
and secure energy future by investing 
over $14 billion in clean energy and 
science, which will create tens of thou-
sands of good paying jobs. We will also 
make sure K–12 educational institu-
tions have the resources they need, 
with robust investment in Title I and 
special education, Pell Grants, and 
other financial assistance so students’ 
success is not limited by their income 
or their ZIP Code. 
We will provide strong funding for 
minority-serving 
institutions, 
like 
HBCUs, like in my own district, the 
University of the Virgin Islands, along 
with Hispanic-serving institutions, and 
Tribally-controlled colleges and uni-
versities. 
The American Jobs and Family Plan 
will honor our responsibility to our 
veterans by supporting them with in-
vestments in veterans’ healthcare, in-
cluding women’s healthcare and men-
tal health, combating veterans’ home-
lessness, creating economic opportuni-
ties, and rebuilding military infra-
structure. 
House Democrats are supporting the 
Jobs and Family Plan, which will ad-
vance justice and opportunity, secure 
opportunities for underserved 
busi-
nesses, low-income communities, com-
munities of color, rural communities, 
and others too often left behind. 
Democrats believe that we should in-
vest in what we value as a Nation. We 
are investing in the American people, 
American economy, and our American 
values of opportunity, prosperity, and 
justice for all. 
f 
RETAIN THE HYDE AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. LATURNER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of retaining 
the Hyde amendment, and the bipar-
tisan spirit that has allowed this com-
monsense provision to remain in law 
every year since 1976. 
This past January 22 marked the 48th 
anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 
Roe v. Wade decision, which struck 
down any laws protecting unborn chil-
dren from abortion in every State in 
the Union. The Roe v. Wade decision 
has now resulted in the tragic deaths of 
over 62.5 million unborn children, and 
currently it is estimated that as many 
as 2,500 unborn American lives are 
ended every day through abortion. 
When this body first enacted the 
Hyde amendment in 1976 through fund-
ing for what was then the Health, Edu-
cation, and Welfare agency, the vote 
was an overwhelming bipartisan 312–93. 
And even prior to that final enactment, 
nearly half of Democrats in the House 
voted for the amendment when it was 
first considered. 
This began a 40-year agreement on 
both sides of the aisle that Americans 
opposed to abortion should not be 
forced to violate their conscience and 
religious liberty, by subsidizing abor-
tions through their tax dollars. 
The principle that no citizen should 
be forced to pay for these services that 
contravene their strongly held beliefs 
has stood the test of time, and it is one 
that this body should protect and high-
ly regard. 
But most importantly, this simple 
budget rider has saved more human 
lives from abortion than any other pol-
icy at the Federal level. Today, it is es-
timated that over 2.5 million lives have 
been saved by the Hyde amendment 
since it was first enacted. 
To this day, this prohibition on tax-
payer funding of abortion enjoys strong 
support with the American people. A 
Marist poll earlier this year found that 
almost 60 percent of the Americans op-
posed the use of taxpayer-funded abor-
tions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3916 
July 27, 2021 
The Hyde amendment has histori-
cally been supported by mainstream 
Democrats as well. In 1994, President 
Biden wrote in a letter to a con-
stituent, ‘‘The government should not 
tell those with strong convictions 
against abortion, such as you and I, 
that we must pay for them.’’ Again, in 
2005, he remarked that abortion was 
‘‘always a tragedy,’’ and said, ‘‘I think 
we should be focusing on how to limit 
the number of abortions.’’ And as re-
cently as last year, he acknowledged 
the fact that the majority of the Amer-
ican 
people 
agree 
with 
the 
Hyde 
amendment. 
I can assure you that nothing has 
changed in the time since President 
Biden made those statements, other 
than perhaps a desire to appease the 
belligerent, liberal left that dominates 
Democrat policy today. 
Back in Kansas, the Kansas Supreme 
Court wrongly ruled in Hodes & Nauser 
v. Schmidt. They ruled that it paves 
the way for unrestricted, unlimited, 
and even State taxpayer-funded abor-
tion. I am grateful for the work of Kan-
sans for Life, the Kansas Catholic Con-
ference, the Kansas Family Policy Alli-
ance, and all of the Republican legisla-
tors in the statehouse who have placed 
the Value Them Both Amendment on 
the ballot next year. 
The Value Them Both Amendment 
will allow for commonsense regula-
tions of the abortion industry that pro-
tect both the baby and the mother, and 
ensures no State taxpayer funds will be 
used to fund abortion. 
I am confident that when Kansas vot-
ers speak on this issue next year, Kan-
sans will choose life. And I think Kan-
sans’ respect for the sanctity of life can 
be a model for Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, respectfully 
encourage my colleagues across the 
aisle to reconsider voting to remove 
the Hyde amendments from law. And I 
pray that President Biden will return 
to supporting the commonsense Hyde 
amendment as he had for his first 46 
years of public service. 
Congress must reaffirm our commit-
ment to defending the most vulnerable 
lives among us, the unborn. We must 
reaffirm and retain the Hyde amend-
ment, legislation that is supported by 
both Republicans and Democrats in 
Congress and in the White House, for 
over a generation. We must reject the 
abortion politics of the far left, and 
continue to find a way to work to-
gether whenever possible to protect 
human life at its most vulnerable 
stage.

LOWERING COST OF 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today as Americans continue to 
face a prescription drug crisis. 
Americans pay three to four times 
more than families in other developed 
countries for the exact same drugs. 
Kids, families, seniors, we all feel the 
effects of skyrocketing prices of medi-
cations. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
insulin 
costs 
have 
grown to 10 times that of any other de-
veloped country, with annual costs per 
patient, for just the insulin, now at 
nearly $6,000. 
One in four seniors reports difficulty 
affording their prescriptions, with one 
in five reporting not taking their medi-
cation because of the cost. 
This is heartbreaking. It is unaccept-
able, and it demands that we, as Mem-
bers of Congress, must take action 
now. 
Whether it is H.R. 3, empowering 
Medicare 
to 
negotiate 
prescription 
drug prices, which will bring down pre-
scription costs, not just for seniors, but 
for individuals and families across 
America, or my bill, the Seniors SAVE 
on Prescription Drugs Act, which will 
strengthen senior savings and expand 
access to the Medicare Part D Extra 
Help program. 
It is time for us to lower drug prices, 
lower premiums, and lower out-of- 
pocket costs for American families. 
And it is time to take action and end 
our prescription drug crisis now. 
f 
BIDEN POLICIES HURTING 
TENNESSEANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
because I am concerned about the fi-
nancial security of our Nation. 
Whether you are standing in the 
checkout line at the grocery store or at 
the gas pump, it is clear that Ten-
nesseans and Americans everywhere 
are facing a bitter reality. We are 6 
months into the Biden Presidency, and 
we are feeling the effects of his reck-
less spending decisions as prices for ev-
eryday foods, goods, and even gas sky-
rocket. 
According to a recent study, 83 per-
cent of Americans surveyed said they 
noticed price increases in June and 
July. Right now, families find them-
selves paying 45 percent more for gas, 7 
percent more for fruit, almost 6 per-
cent more for milk, and 18 percent 
more for bacon just since Biden was 
sworn in. 
Inflation is like a cruel and regres-
sive tax hike on the working people of 
this Nation who can afford it the very 
least. For older Tennesseans on fixed 
incomes that often do not grow with 
inflation, high inflation is even more 
cruel. 
President 
Biden’s 
policies 
have 
caused inflation to grow every month 
since he took office and, often, at a 
rapid clip. This means Tennesseans and 
all Americans are paying more for gro-
ceries, more for prescription drugs, and 
more for household goods, and their 
take-home pay after taxes is worth less 
than it was, as if they got a pay cut 
through no fault of their own. 
What will the administration do to 
combat drastic rises in inflation? The 
answer to that appears to be absolutely 
nothing. In fact, they are doubling 
down and making it worse. 
President Biden and his fellow social-
ist Democrats want to keep spending 
money on things we can’t afford and 
increasing taxes on everyone, which, 
along with the inflation monster, cre-
ates a one-two punch to the gut of all 
Tennesseans and especially the ones 
who are most vulnerable and who can 
least afford it. 
Another massive $3.5 trillion spend-
ing package that will raise taxes and 
further fuel inflation is not what our 
Nation needs. We need to stop this 
spending spree on the backs of the tax-
payer before it is too late. 
The Biden administration can try to 
talk around it, but the reality remains 
the same: Their policies are hurting 
Tennesseans, and I will never stop 
working to hold them accountable. 
INVESTING IN OUR FAMILIES, 
WORKERS, AND COMMUNITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, the time is 
now to make bolder investments in our 
families, workers, and communities 
across the country. 
For years, I have said that America 
is living off the investments our par-
ents and grandparents made a genera-
tion or two ago. 
Bringing Federal dollars back to my 
home in California’s San Joaquin Val-
ley is one of my highest priorities, as is 
the need to invest throughout the 
country, throughout our Nation, for 
our future infrastructure needs. 
During this week, we will vote on 
new investments that will make a dif-
ference in our communities and the 
residents who live there. From water 
projects to funding jobs, healthcare 
and education programs, our votes this 
week are to improve people’s lives. 
Thus, in this budget appropriations 
that we will be dealing with, these bills 
are critical to pass and send to the 
Senate. 
But our work doesn’t end there. We 
must also pass transformative infra-
structure to build our roads, bridges, 
and transit systems and modernize our 
schools and hospitals. 
Rural and underserved communities 
in our country, many that I represent, 
should never be left behind. 
We also must expand and prioritize 
broadband access to these areas. This 
pandemic has taught us a lot of things, 
like telemedicine and tele-learning is 
difficult enough, but if you don’t have 
access to broadband, good luck. 
Repairing our aging water infrastruc-
ture to ensure reliable access to clean 
drinking water is critical for the rich-
est Nation in the world. We are suf-
fering from extreme droughts in Cali-
fornia. We need to make these invest-
ments.

Also, access to quality healthcare is 
critically important. I have introduced 
legislation to bring more doctors to un-
derserved areas around the country, 
like the San Joaquin Valley, by cre-
ating new medical schools. Everyone, 
no matter who they are or where they 
live, 
deserves 
access 
to 
quality 
healthcare. 
These investments will make life bet-
ter for Americans and will help spur 
economic growth by creating millions 
of good-paying jobs. Guess what? We 
need them. 
The health and development of our 
communities and the economy depend 
on infrastructure, and I encourage my 
colleagues to join me in building back 
America’s future better. 
It is essential that, in the next few 
months, we pass the bipartisan infra-
structure package, the infrastructure 
bill and reconciliation package, to 
bring this country together and to in-
vest in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 21⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF CAROL 
MILLS 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to a dedicated public 
servant and a strong, strong advocate 
for students in my home of Fresno, 
California, Carol Mills. 
Carol Mills was passionate about ev-
erything she ever did. She was a 17- 
year trustee for the Fresno Unified 
School 
District, 
the 
third 
largest 
school district in California, and spent 
every moment of that time fighting for 
more and better opportunities for kids. 
Early this year, Carol Mills was diag-
nosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease. We all 
know it is a terrible disease, yet she 
continued to work throughout that 
courageous battle with Lou Gehrig’s 
disease and served on the Fresno Uni-
fied School Board. Why? Because that 
was Carol. 
During my time in Congress, I got to 
know and see firsthand her passion for 
helping students. Two months ago, I 
visited Carol at her home. We re-
counted 
efforts 
in 
the 
past. 
We 
laughed. We shared the challenges of 
the future because, over the years, she 
never lost sight that our country’s fu-
ture comes first when we prioritize the 
education, the quality education, of 
America’s next generation. That is why 
Carol made a difference in everything 
she ever did. 
Our community and the students of 
Fresno Unified School District were 
made better because of Carol Mills’ 
passion and dedication to not only her 
service but to the quality of their edu-
cation and the future of America. 
She will be missed dearly by every-
one who knew and loved her. My 
thoughts and prayers go to the family 
during this very, very difficult time. 
Carol, we loved you. God bless. 
SUPPORT HYDE AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, in 1994, a 
senior U.S. Senator was asked by a 
constituent how he felt about tax-
payer-funded abortion. The Senator re-
sponded, ‘‘I will continue to abide by 
the same principle that has guided me 
throughout my 21 years in the Senate: 
Those of us who are opposed to abor-
tion should not be compelled to pay for 
them.’’ 
That Senator is now the President of 
the United States. Yes, those were the 
words of President Joe Biden on April 
7, 1994. 
Only 2 years ago, in 2019, then-can-
didate Biden reaffirmed his support of 
the Hyde amendment. A campaign 
statement reiterated that ‘‘his position 
on the Hyde amendment has been con-
sistent.’’ 
Since 1976, Congress’ position on the 
Hyde amendment has also been con-
sistent. The bipartisan Hyde amend-
ment has prevented taxpayer funding 
for abortion. 
But, for the first time in decades, 
House Democrats have stripped this 
provision from the Federal spending 
bills we are considering this week. 
Years of bipartisan consensus have 
been thrown out the door. 
The Hyde amendment is a common-
sense provision that most Americans 
support. In a recent poll, nearly 60 per-
cent of Americans expressed their sup-
port for the Hyde amendment, while 
only 38 percent voiced support for tax-
payer-funded abortions. 
But this issue is not about the poll-
ing or the politics; it is about life. It is 
estimated that the Hyde amendment 
has saved more than 2.4 million lives. 
For over 40 years, these very precious 
lives have been respected, valued, and 
saved because of this bipartisan provi-
sion. 
The survival of millions more pre-
cious lives is at stake. That is why I 
implore my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to reconsider their de-
cision to strip the Hyde amendment 
from the spending bills we are consid-
ering this week. As a society, we must 
value the unborn and protect the sanc-
tity of life. 
Congressman Henry Hyde fought to 
ban taxpayer-funded abortions, he said, 
because he believed firmly in the sanc-
tity of life. As he said, the ‘‘little, al-
most-born infant struggling to live is a 
member of the human family,’’ and 
‘‘abortion is a lethal assault against 
the very idea of human rights and de-
stroys, along with a defenseless little 
baby, the moral foundation of our de-
mocracy.’’ 
The late Congressman Hyde was 
right. This is a moral question. That is 
why I agree with President Biden’s 
statement when he was in the Senate 
many years ago: Those who disagree 
with abortion should not now be forced 
to pay for it. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to come together, just as we 
have for nearly five decades, to support 
the Hyde amendment and stand up and 
defend life. 
f 
CALLING FOR FREEDOM AND 
LIBERTY IN CUBA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address the topic of the recent protests 
in Cuba, where individuals there are 
simply asking for freedom and liberty. 
My mother is one of 14 children. Her 
maiden name is Suarez, Eulalia Maria 
Suarez. She came from Cuba at 20 
years old in 1961. My mother and my 
father raised me to defend freedom, 
freedom of speech. My father fought in 
Vietnam against the communist ad-
vance there. 
What we in America sometimes don’t 
realize is, many other countries, espe-
cially communist countries that are 
tyrannical like Cuba, do not enjoy the 
basic human rights that we enjoy in 
this country and many other people in 
the world enjoy. 
Those rights, such as free speech and 
uncensored internet access, they don’t 
have that in Cuba. Freedom of the 
press, freedom to protest, freedom to 
criticize your government, the right to 
vote in an actual election with more 
than one candidate who doesn’t get 100 
percent of the vote, they don’t have 
those rights in Cuba. 
What they have is a tyrannical, evil 
regime that oppresses their people 
every day. They arrest demonstrators. 
We saw brave men and women in Cuba 
for the first time since 1994, almost 30 
years, thousands of brave men and 
women, people in Cuba, protesting 
against their government, asking for 
freedoms, asking for basic rights like 
the ones I just mentioned that they 
don’t have. 
What did they do? They all got ar-
rested. They put them in jail. They say 
it is for a year. When that year goes by, 
when the regime in Cuba hopes nobody 
else is looking, they are going to make 
it 5 years. And they abuse them in jail. 
That is what happens to protesters in 
these types of countries. 
Now, look, I want to say that I actu-
ally agree with Joe Biden on this, on 
what he said. Joe Biden said, on July 
12, this year, and I am going to quote 
him: ‘‘We stand with the Cuban people 
and their clarion call for freedom and 
relief from the tragic grip of the pan-
demic and from the decades of repres-
sion and economic suffering to which 
they have been subjected by Cuba’s au-
thoritarian regime. The Cuban people 
are bravely asserting fundamental and 
universal rights.’’ 
President Biden continues: ‘‘Those 
rights, including the right of peaceful 
protest and the right to freely deter-
mine their own future, must be re-
spected. The United States calls on the 
Cuban regime to hear their people and 
serve their needs at this vital moment 
rather than enriching themselves.’’

H3918 
July 27, 2021 
b 1100 
Look, President Biden and, unfortu-
nately not all, but many, Democrats 
and Republicans agree on this issue, 
but we need aggressive solutions to the 
issue. 
If the United States of America does 
not lead, no one else will. They are 
looking to us for leadership. They are 
looking to President Biden for leader-
ship. They are looking to Congress for 
leadership. We need every freedom-lov-
ing country to condemn this evil, ty-
rannical regime and their constant 
abuses of their people. 
America and other countries should 
not do business with this Communist 
regime. As Biden himself said, they 
will only ‘‘enrich themselves,’’ and 
that is what they do. Instead, we 
should use every pressure point we can 
to defend freedom and the basic rights 
for the Cuban people. 
This is a heartfelt issue for many. We 
enjoy these freedoms, and sometimes 
we forget how tough it is and how 
much support people need in struggling 
countries like Cuba. Right now is the 
time to show strong support for the 
people of Cuba and for their basic 
human rights.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Heavenly Creator, author and giver 
of our lives, we dare to approach You 
this morning with our prayers, know-
ing in faith that You are receptive to 
our requests and in Your mercy will at-
tend to our needs. 
And so we ask, that You would an-
swer. We ask for Your favor as we bring 
before You our need for guidance, pa-
tience, and direction. Answer us with 
Your voice of clarity, Your calming 
presence, a sign to lead us forward in 
the way You would have us go. 
We seek. We seek Your wisdom as we 
approach delicate and complex issues. 
May we find our way into the heart of 
each matter, that prejudices and poli-
tics would be left behind and Your 
truth would reveal itself to us. 
Lord, we knock on doors that seem 
closed 
to 
conversation 
and 
com-
promise. Open for us opportunities 
wherein we discover room for growth 
and cooperation, and may the doors of 
our own hearts be encouraged to open 
to possibilities we may be reluctant to 
consider. 
To You who can do infinitely more 
than we could ever ask or imagine, we 
ask, we seek, we knock, that You in 
Your infinite mercy would give us this 
day what we need. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

APPROPRIATIONS BILLS ADVANCE 
IN THE HOUSE 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
Democrats are making sure that as a 
nation we build back better to create 
more jobs, cut taxes, and lower costs. 
President Biden’s and congressional 
Democrats’ economic plan to build 
from the bottom up and the middle out 
is working. America is getting back to 
work, and working families are seeing 
the results. 
Jobs are coming back. Under Presi-
dent Biden’s leadership in the past 6 
months, the economy has gone from 
creating only 60,000 new jobs a month 
to creating 60,000 jobs every 3 days. 
Wages are rising. American workers 
are seeing long overdue pay raises, 
bringing home more money to their 
families, 
and 
powering 
economic 
growth that comes from the bottom up 
and the middle out. 
Paychecks are growing. 
The economy is growing. Thanks to 
Democrats’ leadership, the economy is 
growing faster than at any time in the 
last 40 years. Independent projections 
from the Federal Reserve, the World 
Bank, and many others all forecast 
America this year reaching the highest 
levels of growth in nearly four decades; 
and small business optimism is back to 
pre-pandemic highs. 
f 
KLAMATH BASIN 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, ac-
tions by the Federal Government are 
devastating the Klamath Basin on the 
north end of California and south Or-
egon. Earlier this year our government 
cut off all of the water for the Klamath 
Basin from the farmers and the wildlife 
in order to deal with Endangered Spe-
cies Act rules for two competing spe-
cies of fish. 
Madam Speaker, you can see the dev-
astation last year with a duck kill that 
happened inside the refuge. We did 
manage to rescue this one. 
The wildlife refuge has no water. The 
farmers who also provide water, food, 
and resting areas for migratory birds 
now cannot provide food or habitat, 
and the entire basin is hurting. The 
government has created an ecological 
disaster that will result in the death of 
tens of thousands of federally protected 
migratory birds. 
Last year when the Bureau of Rec-
lamation reduced the water by more 
than half, 60,000 birds died of botulism. 
I toured this area last year, and it is 
indeed devastating. This year there is 
zero water. 
There is no habitat for nesting birds 
and no feed for them from farmers. 
This is a government created disaster, 
and our environment and people are 
paying the price. We need to deliver 
the water that farmers own to the 
farmers, and that will also in turn help 
deliver water to the Federal refuge. 
Federal courts and the Bureau of 
Reclamation need to get out of the way 
and let the people on the ground suc-
ceed for food and for our wildlife. 
f 
GROWN FLOWER MONTH 
(Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the importance 
of 
buying 
American-grown 
flowers. 
Whether it is celebrating a wedding, a 
graduation, or sending condolences, 
flowers have been used to mark signifi-
cant occasions for thousands of years. I 
have seen the value this industry adds 
to our economy and communities dur-
ing my visits with our hardworking 
central coast growers. 
The cut-flower industry generates 
thousands of jobs and produces signifi-
cant 
economic 
activity 
each 
year 
through flower farmers, distributors, 
and florists. 
California grows an astonishing 70 
percent of American-grown flowers, 
and yet only a fraction of the flowers 
sold across the country were grown 
here. That must change.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3919 
July 27, 2021 
Last week, Senator FEINSTEIN and I 
introduced a resolution to designate 
July as American-Grown Flower and 
Foliage Month to encourage consumers 
to shop local and buy flowers with a 
certified American-grown label. By 
passing H. Res. 542, we will honor the 
beauty this industry brings to our 
homes year-round and help keep our 
American-grown flower industry pros-
perous. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join us in this effort. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I am proud to stand for the sanctity of 
life and believe strongly in our respon-
sibility to protect the unborn. 
While I understand that the issue of 
abortion is one that divides many here 
in Congress, H.R. 18 does not univer-
sally ban all abortions. It would simply 
reinstate and make permanent the bi-
partisan Hyde amendment on a govern-
ment-wide basis, which only prevents 
taxpayers from paying for the killing 
of unborn children. 
It is what the majority of Americans 
want. In fact, a recent Marist Poll 
found that nearly 60 percent of Ameri-
cans oppose taxpayer funded abortion. 
It is shocking and heartbreaking the 
Democrats would remove this critical 
protection from law after supporting it 
for over 40 years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships. 
f 
JANUARY 6TH INSURRECTION 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, today the House convened the 
first public hearing of the Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the U.S. Capitol and the 
very essence of American democracy. 
In shocking, raw, and real testimony, 
four brave police officers shared stories 
of their harrowing experiences that 
day. 
United States Capitol Police Ser-
geant Gonell, an 8-year veteran of the 
United States Army assigned to some 
of the most dangerous duties during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, said he was 
more afraid to work at the Capitol on 
that day than he was in his entire time 
serving his country in Iraq. 
The video is hard to watch, and the 
testimony is emotional, but the com-
mittee’s work promises truth and 
transparency. The events of January 6 
would have yielded more death and de-
struction were it not for the United 
States Capitol Police. 
We are grateful for them and to the 
committee for working to provide the 
answers and accountability needed to 
make sure this event never happens 
again. 
f 
HONORING MICHAEL SHUEY, 
OLYMPIC ATHLETE 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, last week the 2020 
Summer Olympics kicked off in Tokyo. 
For the next 2 weeks, we will see the 
best of the best compete in a variety of 
events. 
This year the United States sent a 
613-member team to compete in the 
Olympic Games. The journey to these 
games and to be on the 2020 Olympic 
team is unlike any other. For the first 
time in Olympic history, the games 
were postponed from last summer due 
to COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, Pennsylvania sent 
21 athletes to Tokyo. But there is one 
member of the team I would like to 
honor today: Michael Shuey. 
Michael is an Elk County, Pennsyl-
vania, native and a 2016 graduate of 
Pennsylvania State University. Mi-
chael is a two-time NCAA Big Ten 
champion in javelin and a two-time 
NCAA Big Ten first team member. 
While in Tokyo he will be competing in 
the javelin throw. 
Congratulations to Michael and to all 
the athletes on this incredible achieve-
ment. We are cheering for their suc-
cess. 
f 
HEALTH CARE 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. 
MCBATH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
when I hear from our friends and neigh-
bors across Georgia, there is no issue 
that families find more concerning 
than 
that 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
their 
healthcare. 
As a two-time breast cancer survivor, 
access to quality healthcare is very, 
very personal to me. While I was in the 
hospital, all I had to do was focus on 
the strength of my family, the grace of 
the God that I love, and winning my 
battle with cancer. 
Yet still, far too many families are 
forced to worry about paying for their 
chemotherapy 
versus 
affording 
the 
mortgage on their home. That is why I 
continue to work so hard every day to 
expand affordable healthcare for fami-
lies across Georgia and across the Na-
tion and why I am so proud that my 
bill to cut healthcare costs for those 
who have been laid off during the pan-
demic was signed into law by our Presi-
dent. 
No American should ever be forced to 
make the decision between putting 
food on the table or paying for their 
family’s medical bills. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 18 which 
would make the Hyde amendment per-
manent. 
This week we will consider the par-
tisan Health and Human Services budg-
et. It is unfortunate that Democrats 
are continuing their assault on the fun-
damental right to life in this bill. It 
kills the Hyde amendment which en-
sures taxpayer dollars cannot be spent 
on abortions. 
Hyde has saved 2.5 million babies 
since it was enacted. My faith teaches 
me that every person is created for a 
purpose and a reason, and that is why 
I will always be a defender of the un-
born. Americans should not be forced 
to fork over their taxpayer dollars so 
defenseless babies can be murdered on 
the taxpayer dime. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair has previously advised, that re-
quest cannot be entertained without 
appropriate clearance. 
f 
ISRAEL SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
(Miss RICE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Miss RICE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of the fiscal year 2022 State and For-
eign Operations appropriations bill, 
which provides critical foreign assist-
ance funding. 
Specifically, I want to highlight that 
the bill fully funds the $3.3 billion in 
security assistance to our ally Israel, 
without conditions or restrictions, pre-
serving Israel’s fundamental right to 
self-defense. 
House passage of this bill would dem-
onstrate America’s unwavering com-
mitment to Israel, and to achieving 
true peace and stability throughout 
the region. There should be no reason 
for anyone in this esteemed body to op-
pose it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3920 
July 27, 2021 
I stand here today to urge all of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support Israel, the world’s only Jewish 
state. I thank Chairwoman DELAURO, 
Chairwoman LEE, and the entire House 
Appropriations Committee for their 
work on this vital funding bill, and I 
ask the House to bring this bill up for 
a vote as soon as possible. Madam 
Speaker, I, again, urge all of my col-
leagues to support it. 
f 
FISCAL INCOMPETENCE 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, it 
is hard to believe there is anything else 
going on here with 3,000 people a day 
streaming across our southern border, 
but we are taking time to put together 
our budget for the next fiscal year. And 
in light of the fact that we recently 
cleared $28 trillion in debt, it is impor-
tant to look at how frugal we are going 
into next year. 
If you look, Labor HHS, which is a 
significant part of the budget, is going 
up 36 percent; Interior and the Envi-
ronment going up 19 percent; Transpor-
tation and HUD up 13 percent; indi-
vidual smaller lines even more. The 
White House is taking this opportunity 
to increase its spending by 39 percent; 
the Vice President by 22 percent; the 
EPA is going up 23 percent. This is just 
plain fiscally out of control. 
Meanwhile, the only area of the 
budget that probably should go up, 
Homeland Security, which guards our 
border, is not going up at all. In any 
event, I hope the press has some time 
to put some of those numbers out there 
so the public can see that the fiscal in-
competence of this House continues on. 
f 
STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS 
(Mr. SWALWELL asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, 
millions of Americans are in the quick-
sand of student loan debt, and we ought 
to do something about it. 
Student loan debt is the second high-
est form of consumer debt impacting 
one-fifth of U.S. households, to the 
tune of $1.6 trillion. At this rate, it 
would take a college graduate with a 
bachelor’s degree nearly 20 years to 
pay off their loans. That is why I have 
introduced bills to attack this crisis 
and put more money in the pockets of 
young Americans. 
With bills like my No Student Loan 
Interest Act, all interest on new and 
existing Federal loans would be elimi-
nated. Zero percent interest going for-
ward. And for graduates who devote 
their careers to public service, we en-
sure they receive loan forgiveness in 
proportion to their years of public 
service. 
Making college affordable is not a 
Republican or Democratic issue, it is 
an American issue, so that young 
Americans can start families, start 
new jobs, and start to build a business, 
if that is what they desire to do. It is 
one that benefits every living genera-
tion from the students of yesterday to 
the students of tomorrow. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. JACKSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to ask that this body con-
sider H.R. 18, a bill that would make 
the Hyde amendment permanent. The 
Hyde amendment ensures Federal tax 
dollars are not spent on murdering in-
nocent babies. It has enjoyed bipar-
tisan support for over 40 years now. 
But now the Hyde amendment is 
under attack because my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle have shifted 
so far to the left that they apparently 
don’t feel human life is worth fighting 
for. 
Here in Congress, we have a duty to 
our constituents to consider legislation 
on the most pressing issues of our 
time. But so far we have been blocked 
from voting or even debating on this 
critical legislation. 
I will never give up in fighting for 
the most vulnerable among us, and I 
will also speak up for those who can’t 
speak for themselves. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair has previously advised, that re-
quest cannot be entertained absent ap-
propriate clearance. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF SID MORRISON 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Honorable 
Sid Morrison on a lifetime of selfless 
public service. Sid recently retired as 
the chair of Energy Northwest Execu-
tive Board, having dedicated 20 years 
to supporting northwest public power. 
And that was only the latest chapter in 
a storied career spanning seven dec-
ades. 
Embodying the spirit and commit-
ment of the Greatest Generation, Sid 
served in the U.S. Army, spent 14 years 
in the Washington legislature, and was 
elected to six terms in the U.S. House 
of Representatives representing Cen-
tral 
Washington, 
before 
being 
ap-
pointed as Washington’s Secretary of 
Transportation. 
A lifelong Washingtonian, Sid has 
long been a role model in the Ever-
green State, and the recently-dedicated 
Morrison Energy Center in Richland 
will serve as tribute to his innovative 
spirit and enduring legacy. 
A man of humility, compassion, and 
conviction, it is my honor to call Sid a 
mentor and a friend. I ask the House to 
join me in congratulating our former 
colleague on a most-distinguished ca-
reer and deserved retirement.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
555. The rule provides for consideration 
of H.R. 4502, the Labor, Health and 
Human 
Services, 
Education, 
Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Energy 
and 
Water 
Development, 
Financial 
Services and General Government, In-
terior, 
Environment, Military Con-
struction, Veterans Affairs, Transpor-
tation, and Housing and Urban Devel-
opment Appropriations Act, 2022, under 
a structured rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations or 
their designees. The rule self-executes 
a manager’s amendment from Chair-
woman DELAURO, makes in order 229 
amendments, provides en bloc author-
ity for the chairwoman or her designee, 
and provides one motion to recommit. 
The rule provides the majority lead-
er, or his designee, the ability through 
July 30 to en bloc requested roll call 
votes on suspension bills considered on 
July 26 or 27. 
The rule also provides that requested 
roll call votes on suspension bills con-
sidered on July 26 or 27 may be post-
poned through September 22, 2021. 
Finally, the rule amends H. Res. 188 
to provide recess instructions, suspen-
sion authority, and same day authority 
through September 22, 2021. 
Madam Speaker, if you care about 
protecting our seniors and taking care 
of our veterans and military families; 
if you care about fighting climate 
change and combating gun violence; if 
you care about closing health dispari-
ties and creating good paying jobs; and 
if you care about our economy not only 
rebounding from the COVID pandemic, 
but being strengthened for years to 
come, then the underlying measure is a 
lifeline. Because these seven appropria-
tions measures provide landmark fund-
ing to deal with our Nation’s most 
pressing issues. 
It turns the page on an era where the 
prior administration demanded dis-
investment in seemingly everything 
that helped all but the wealthiest of 
the wealthy. And now we are working 
with the Biden administration to stand 
up for our workers and to rebuild the 
middle class. 
It is no secret that the appropria-
tions process can seem a little arcane. 
But this measure is truly historic, 
Madam Speaker. 
I want to make two points here in 
particular. First is what is not in here. 
Finally, after more than 40 years, the 
Hyde amendment is nowhere to be 
found. And let me say, it is about damn 
time. Because however we feel about 
abortion, we should not deny health 
coverage just because someone is work-
ing to make ends meet. 
More than half of the women affected 
by the Hyde amendment are women of 
color. Nearly one-third are Black, 27 
percent are Latina, and one-fifth are 
Asian American and Pacific Islanders, 
as well as indigenous women also cov-
ered by Medicaid. 
That is what inequality looks like, 
Madam Speaker, and I am proud that 
we are confronting it. The decision 
about whether to get an abortion is a 
deeply personal one. We don’t know the 
circumstances. But I do know this: we 
should not defer to the politicians and 
special interest groups who want to im-
pose their values on others. We should 
trust women and families to make 
their own decisions about what is best 
for them. 
It is about justice. It is about free-
dom. And it is about respecting wom-
en’s personal autonomy. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ap-
propriations Committee Chairwoman 
ROSA DELAURO for leading the way on 
this, and I want to recognize the many 
Congresswomen, 
in 
particular, 
who 
have waged a sometimes lonely battle 
year after year after year to make this 
day a reality. 
Second, Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize language that is included 
here, which will help combat hunger 
across America. This measure expands 
access to healthy foods like fruits and 
vegetables to more than 6 million peo-
ple through the WIC program. It en-
sures that more than 40 million people 
in SNAP-eligible families get benefits 
that they desperately need. And it also 
makes key investments in child nutri-
tion programs, like school meals. This 
is incredibly important since we all 
saw the COVID crisis lay bare the truth 
about hunger in America. 
The lines outside our food banks in-
cluded some of the most affluent cars 
from the wealthiest neighborhoods, be-
cause no one is immune from food inse-
curity. 
b 1230 
It is an epidemic in every State and 
every congressional district in this 
country. Even before the COVID pan-
demic hit, there were more than 35 mil-
lion people who were going hungry in 
this country, including 10 million chil-
dren. 
The United States is the richest 
country on the face of the Earth. That 
anybody—anybody—goes without food 
is unconscionable, Madam Speaker. 
I have often said that we have every-
thing we need to end hunger in Amer-
ica. We have the food, the know-how, 
and, yes, the money. The only thing we 
lack is the political will. Hunger is a 
political condition. 
I think that is finally beginning to 
change, Madam Speaker. 
For the last several months, the 
Rules Committee has acted as a kind of 
select committee on hunger, holding 
hearings, roundtables, and site visits, 
all to develop a road map to eradicate 
hunger in this country by 2030, as the 
United Nations has called for. 
I am more convinced than ever that, 
with a holistic approach and the full 
weight of the Federal Government, a 
hunger-free America is within our 
grasp. 
This rule makes in order my bipar-
tisan amendment to provide $2.5 mil-
lion for a White House conference on 
food, nutrition, hunger, and health. 
The conference will bring together the 
heads of food banks, hospitals, govern-
ment agencies, educators, farmers, the 
faith-based community, people with 
lived experiences, our business commu-
nity, anybody who has anything to do

with finding a solution, not to hold an 
event that is essentially a press re-
lease, but to develop a real plan to 
tackle this, something with bench-
marks that better connects the dots 
between all the different Federal pro-
grams and expands successful local and 
State initiatives. 
The first and only time such a con-
ference was held was the same year we 
put a man on the Moon, over 52 years 
ago. It developed and strengthened 
many programs we still rely on, like 
SNAP, WIC, and the National School 
Lunch Program. 
A hunger conference for the 21st cen-
tury can finish what was started so 
many decades ago by Senators George 
McGovern, Senator Bob Dole, and oth-
ers. 
Senator Dole wrote to Ranking Mem-
ber COLE and me recently, saying: ‘‘I 
remain proud of the work Senator 
McGovern and I did then, and I endorse 
your effort to secure a second White 
House conference to identify the next 
frontier of programs to finally end hun-
ger in America.’’ 
I believe we can do big things, and I 
hope that we can do them in a bipar-
tisan way. 
Madam Speaker, we can combat hun-
ger; we can confront climate change; 
we can stand up for women’s reproduc-
tive rights; and we can take care of the 
most vulnerable among us. This bill is 
proof of that. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join 
with us in supporting this rule and the 
underlying measure so that we can 
build a more just and equitable future 
for every single American. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the distin-
guished chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee, and my good friend, for yield-
ing me the customary 30 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule covers 
H.R. 4502, a seven-bill appropriations 
package for fiscal year 2022, including 
the Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee, where I am the ranking 
member. 
Though I have great affection for my 
good 
friend, 
Chairwoman 
ROSA 
DELAURO, and respect all of my col-
leagues across the aisle, I think this 
package is deeply misguided, and I will 
be opposing it today. 
From the beginning, this package 
was structured on a flawed premise. 
The majority chose to use the 302(b) al-
location numbers, the levels that tell 
each subcommittee how much money 
they can spend, that were totally off 
the mark. 
The majority chose to mark their 
bills to spending levels that called for a 
17 
percent 
increase 
in 
nondefense 
spending, and an inadequate 1 percent 
increase in defense spending, less even 
than the amount the President re-
quested in his own budget. 
At a time when our national security 
is facing repeated threats, ranging 
from the Middle East to Afghanistan to 
the South China Sea, we can hardly af-
ford to return to the continual under-
funding of our military that was the 
hallmark of the Obama-Biden years. 
What is worse, these seven bills ac-
count for a 21 percent increase over fis-
cal year 2021. Across the seven titles, 
the majority is asking to spend more 
than $100 billion more in fiscal year 
2022 than we did just last year. This 
comes on top of massive spending ear-
lier this year with the majority’s $1.9 
trillion COVID spending package, and 
at a time when Democrats in the House 
and the Senate are looking to spend 
another $3.5 trillion as part of a new 
partisan reconciliation bill. This is 
truly tax-and-spend politics like we 
have never seen before. 
But the problems with this bill aren’t 
just with the amount of money that 
they spend. In drafting this package, 
the majority has also chosen to strip 
out longstanding bipartisan policy pro-
visions and, instead, has filled this 
package with partisan, far-left policy 
that simply cannot pass both Chambers 
and become law. 
There is no better illustration of this 
than the majority’s shocking decision 
to remove the Hyde and Weldon amend-
ments. 
For 45 years, through both Demo-
cratic and Republican administrations 
and Democratic and Republican ma-
jorities in the House, the Hyde amend-
ment has been the law. It is a commit-
ment that no Federal tax dollars can 
be used to fund abortions, except in 
certain rare instances, and a commit-
ment to protect the conscience rights 
of the great majority of American tax-
payers who are opposed to publicly 
funding abortions. 
Since 2006, the Weldon amendment 
has protected the conscience rights of 
healthcare providers to not participate 
in abortions if they have a moral objec-
tion to the procedure. 
The very same Democratic majority 
that controls the House today had no 
apparent issue with the Hyde and 
Weldon amendments just 1 year ago 
since they were carried on their Labor- 
HHS-Education 
appropriations 
bill 
without any issue. Yet, this year, the 
majority has inexplicably chosen not 
to include these bipartisan provisions, 
despite receiving support from every 
Democrat on the Appropriations Com-
mittee only last year. 
Removing language that has been in-
cluded in appropriations bills for dec-
ades is not only an overreach by the far 
left, but it also threatens to destabilize 
and upend the entire appropriations 
process. Appropriations bills simply 
cannot pass both Chambers and be 
signed into law without this language. 
Eliminating the Hyde and Weldon 
amendments, given all of their impor-
tance to the American people, also 
eliminates the opportunity for biparti-
sanship. Without a bipartisan deal ap-
proved by both Chambers, we cannot 
reach a successful conclusion to the fis-
cal year 2022 appropriations process. 
Removing this language sends us on 
a collision course for a yearlong con-
tinuing resolution or, worse, a govern-
ment shutdown. 
Madam Speaker, I filed an amend-
ment to today’s package to restore the 
Hyde and Weldon amendments. I did 
not do so alone. I was joined by every 
single 
Republican 
Member 
in 
this 
body—every single one. All 213 mem-
bers of the Republican Conference 
signed on to this important amend-
ment. Yet, when the Rules Committee 
met yesterday, I was shocked that my 
amendment was not made in order. 
Madam Speaker, I find it stunning 
that the majority would not back pro-
visions that are this important to the 
American people. But it serves to show 
how deeply partisan the package before 
us today actually is. The majority sim-
ply prefers to ram through their own 
partisan policy rather than provisions 
that have had bipartisan support for 
decades. 
I find that deeply disappointing, 
Madam Speaker. But I know that to-
day’s bill will not be the last word. 
Whether the majority likes it or not, 
at the end of the day, we will have to 
reach a bipartisan and bicameral deal 
on spending for fiscal year 2022. The al-
ternative is too bleak to contemplate. 
But if the majority fails to com-
promise and fails to work with Repub-
licans, both here and across the Cap-
itol, then they will have only them-
selves to blame. They will bear the re-
sponsibility for the consequences, a 
continuing resolution or, even worse, a 
government shutdown. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule and the underlying legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
before I yield to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MORELLE), I want to 
point out, for the record, the last time 
we had a government shutdown was 
when we had a Republican Congress 
and a Republican President, so I am 
not so much worried about that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MORELLE), a distinguished member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend, the chair of the 
Rules Committee, who not only leads 
us every day in the committee but, I 
think, deserves high praise for his in-
spired leadership on the question of 
hunger. 
I have been privileged to be in a num-
ber of hearings that he has held, and I 
know we are making a difference in the 
appropriations bills before us, so I 
thank him for his continued leadership 
in that regard. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the rule. 
It is said that budgets are a state-
ment of values. With this year’s appro-
priations package, we are making our 
priorities crystal clear: uplifting work-
ing families and building a strong eco-
nomic future for all Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3923 
July 27, 2021 
This is arguably one of the most im-
portant funding bills in many years as 
it comes in the midst of a historic glob-
al pandemic that has left families and 
businesses alike reeling from its im-
pacts. 
As we work to rebound from the dev-
astation of the COVID–19 crisis, we 
must seize the opportunity before us 
and 
make 
transformational 
invest-
ments to support our Nation’s recov-
ery, both now and in the future. I am 
pleased to say that my colleagues and 
I have worked hard to craft an appro-
priations package that will do just 
that. 
I am particularly proud to have 
helped deliver essential funding to up-
lift families in my community of Roch-
ester, New York, by expanding commu-
nity health services, workforce devel-
opment initiatives, youth programs, 
and more. 
We are investing in infrastructure, in 
better-paying jobs with benefits and 
apprenticeship training, and in afford-
able housing and daycare resources for 
working families. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
COVID–19 
has 
shined a stark light on the inequities 
that have existed within our commu-
nities for decades. We have a responsi-
bility to take action and ensure that 
we don’t just rebuild what was, that we 
truly embrace President Biden’s creed 
and build back better. 
That is why, with this appropriations 
package, we are also going to support 
equity for underserved communities 
with targeted economic investments, 
confront the climate crisis head-on, 
and invest in our Nation’s greatest as-
sets, its people, by empowering them 
with the tools they need to uplift their 
families and be successful. 
Coming out of this pandemic has not 
been easy, but we have made tremen-
dous strides. Let’s keep our foot on the 
gas, pass this rule, and move forward 
with this historic investment. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in sup-
port of the rule and in support of the 
underlying appropriations bill. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to bring up H.R. 4698 
for immediate consideration. This bill 
addresses 
the 
growing 
problem 
in 
American schools of educators pushing 
their own ideology onto students by 
forcing them to use the pedagogy of 
critical race theory. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. OWENS), the author of this amend-
ment to further explain the amend-
ment. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to moving the previous 
question so we can immediately con-
sider my bill, H.R. 4698, the Say No to 
Indoctrination Act, which prohibits 
Federal funds from advancing the hate-
ful critical race theory concepts. 
I grew up in the Deep South during 
the days of KKK, Jim Crow, and seg-
regation. I have felt the pain of racism 
and have seen and experienced first-
hand when people act unjustly toward 
others due to the color of their skin. 
And, yes, it still happens today when 
individuals choose hate. 
Once an unknown academic theory, 
the increasingly pervasive CRT says 
that racism permanently stains the 
fabric of American society. The critical 
race theorists believe that we are de-
fined solely by our skin color. They be-
lieve that America’s institutions pre-
serve white supremacy. Some even be-
lieve that our Nation is hopelessly rac-
ist. 
To try to make this divisive theory 
understandable, teachers often sepa-
rate students into separate groups 
based on intrinsic characteristics like 
race, color, and national origin. In 
doing so, students are taught to judge 
others based on their appearance. In 
the 1960s, this was called pure racism. 
In the span of a few weeks, Demo-
crats have gone from claiming that 
CRT was only a myth to boldly em-
bracing it. They have gone from dis-
missing parental objections to endors-
ing indoctrination in schools across the 
country. The American people are 
right in their distrust. 
Make no mistake, I want our stu-
dents to learn about the hundreds of 
moments that shaped us into the coun-
try we are today. Students should 
learn about slavery and its legacy. Stu-
dents should learn about the Declara-
tion of Independence, the United States 
Constitution, the Emancipation Proc-
lamation, Juneteenth, Jim Crow, the 
Tulsa race massacre, and the Civil 
Rights Acts. 
They should also be taught and be 
proud of a Nation that, for over 200 
years, has progressed, a country that 
has shown its commitment to its mis-
sion statement that all men and 
women are created equal. 
We have not always lived up to our 
ideals but have come closer with each 
passing generation in doing so. 
Racism exists. I grew up with it and 
have zero tolerance for bigotry and 
hate. More can be done to create a 
world that teaches greater tolerance 
and respects the dignity of every indi-
vidual, regardless of race, color, or 
creed. CRT is not the solution. 
b 1245 
It is absolutely wrong and un-Amer-
ican to indoctrinate our children into 
believing that because of their skin 
color, they are forever part of the op-
pressed or oppressor class. Hate has no 
place in our schools, and CRT has no 
place in our classes. 
We live in a world of imperfect people 
and in a country that from its incep-
tion understood this. It was, therefore, 
placed within our mission statement a 
goal to grow, to change, and to form a 
more perfect union. 
I choose to believe in a country 
where we are judged not by the color of 
our skin but by the content of our 
character. 
I choose to believe in a country that 
empowers all individuals to dream big 
and to live fulfilling lives. 
Madam Speaker, if you share my be-
lief in our great Nation, then you, too, 
will vote to defeat the previous ques-
tion so we can take up and pass, on be-
half of the American people, the Say 
No to Indoctrination Act. I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, it should 
be easy to agree that schools, espe-
cially primary schools, should focus 
solely on facts-based education, with-
out political overtones. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from South Carolina 
(Ms. MACE), who will speak more about 
the importance of defeating the pre-
vious question because of the potential 
indoctrination of school children posed 
by schools teaching critical race the-
ory. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition today to moving the pre-
vious question so that we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 4698, a critical 
bill to ensure none of the funds made 
available in any legislation providing 
appropriations may be used to teach or 
advance concepts that separate indi-
viduals based on race, color, or na-
tional origin; that would assign charac-
teristics or assumptions to individuals 
based on race, color, or national origin; 
or that would state or imply that the 
United States is an inherently racist 
country. 
Critical race theory assumes that the 
tenets of freedom and equality, upon 
which our country was founded, are 
simply a mirage to mask systematic 
racism, 
and 
that 
our 
government 
should not provide any tax money to 
fund its teaching. Critical race theory 
is Marxist ideology that should not be 
taught anywhere or be used by any-
one’s tax dollars to be spent on our vet-
erans or our children in public schools 
today. 
Critical race theory assumes that to 
be born White is to be born guilty and 
to be born racist. And to be born Black 
is to be born oppressed or to be born a 
victim. These concepts have begun to 
trickle into our public schools, even 
though the vast majority of Americans 
disavow it and reject it. 
Nothing could be more un-American 
than seeking to divide our young chil-
dren based on factors outside of their 
control. You can watch many school 
board meetings across the Nation right 
now where parents, Black and White, 
are rejecting critical race theory. 
The future leaders of our country 
must be encouraged to chart their own 
path 
without 
seeing 
everything 
through a lens of race. Rather than 
teaching our Black and Brown and Af-
rican-American children that they are

victims and they are oppressed, we can 
teach them that they are heroes. 
We can teach them about heroes in 
our history like Harriet Tubman, who 
saved 750 slaves, rescued them in one 
night in Beaufort County, South Caro-
lina; we can teach them about Robert 
Smalls, who commandeered a Civil War 
ship during the Civil War and freed 
himself and everyone on that ship and 
their families; and we can teach them 
about Joseph Rainey, who was the first 
Black American elected to the U.S.

elected from the State of South Caro-

South Carolina’s First Congressional

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD a July 14 Media 
Matters article entitled, ‘‘FOX News’ 
Obsession with Critical Race Theory, 
by the Numbers.’’ 
[From Media Matters, July 14, 2021] 
FOX NEWS’ OBSESSION WITH CRITICAL RACE 
THEORY, BY THE NUMBERS 
(By Lis Power) 
Update (7/14/21): Following the publication 
of this study, Media Matters continued to 
track mentions of ‘‘critical race theory’’ on 
Fox News. In June, there were 901 mentions 
on the network, the highest number of any 
month and an increase from 537 mentions in 
May. In the past 31⁄2 months there have been 
over 1,900 mentions of critical race theory on 
the network. 
ORIGINAL STUDY 
Critical race theory, to those who can ac-
tually define it, is an academic and legal 
framework that examines the impact of sys-
temic racism on American society. For con-
servatives 
however, 
it’s 
the 
latest 
boogeyman they can use to scare people into 
thinking America’s children are being ‘‘in-
doctrinated’’ by ‘‘woke’’ leftist teachers. And 
while that is not even remotely the case, 
this idea is exploding on Fox News and in Re-
publican-run state legislatures, leading to 
legislative bans in many states and sky-
rocketing mentions of critical race theory 
on the network. 
As Media Matters has previously noted, 
Fox News’ current obsession with ‘‘critical 
race theory’’ has been a year in making. 
What once was a slow trickle of monthly 
mentions has developed into a full blown as-
sault. Since February, month over month 
mentions of the theory have more than dou-
bled on Fox News as the network has begun 
to spin an illusion of what it is and where 
it’s being taught (in reality, critical race 
theory is not generally taught in K–12). Cov-
erage of the theory sharply increased in 
March, with 107 mentions on the network ac-
cording to data from Kinetiq media moni-
toring service. The following month, net-
work figures and guests mentioned it 226 
times, and by May, the number had in-
creased to 537 mentions. Not even halfway 
through June, there’s already been 408 men-
tions on the network. 
Just last week, Fox mentioned ‘‘critical 
race theory’’ a record 244 times—an increase 
from the previous record high of 170 men-
tions the week before. 
Fox has admitted its reason for this 
souped-up coverage: the 2022 midterm elec-
tions. And in order to drum up outrage, the 
network has repeatedly amplified a lie that 
critical race theory teaches that one race is 
‘‘inherently superior to another.’’ More re-
cently, in its continued efforts to demonize 
it, Fox News has promoted a pamphlet that 
echoes the white nationalist ‘‘Great Replace-
ment’’ conspiracy theory. 
Fox’s obsession with what it defines as 
‘‘critical race theory’’ has frequently crossed 
the threshold into the absurd and overly dra-
matic. Fox host Tucker Carlson called it ‘‘a 
cult,’’ while host Will Cain said it is ‘‘mod-
ern-day Jim Crow.’’ Fox contributor Miranda 
Devine claimed that teaching the theory 
would ‘‘warp the minds of American chil-
dren’’ and ‘‘is a recipe for social upheaval 
and mental illness.’’ Fox’s Newt Gingrich 
said it was being driven by ‘‘people who want 
to brainwash your child.’’ 
By labeling everything that has to do with 
race ‘‘critical race theory,’’ Fox is attempt-
ing to shut down conversations about race 
and racism—which is ironic given the net-
work’s claims that it champions free speech. 
And even though many conservatives who 
lambast it don’t have a clue what the theory 
actually is, their efforts are working as 21 
states are either introducing bans or have 
banned what they call ‘‘critical race the-
ory.’’ Many educators in those states have 
argued that the bills and laws would essen-
tially ‘‘whitewash history’’ and have criti-
cized legislators for making it difficult to 
have necessary conversations about race. 
METHODOLOGY 
Media Matters searched transcripts in the 
Kinetiq video database for all original pro-
gramming on Fox News Channel for the key 
phrase ‘‘critical race theory’’ from June 2020 
through June 13, 2021. We counted each in-
stance of the phrase as a single mention. 
Methodology update (7/14/21): Data now in-
cludes midnight episodes of Fox News @ 
Night (which recently shifted its time slot) 
and all new programming from June 14 
through July 11, 2021. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
apparently my Republican friends and 
their allies in the media need a new 
scare tactic because they don’t want to 
talk about things like the economy or 
how we put people back to work or how 
we crushed the virus. But we are not 
going to debate on whether racism ex-
ists in America because it does. 
We are not going to debate whether 
we should teach our kids racism is 
wrong. We should. 
We are not going to debate whether 
individual States and schools can de-
cide what their kids learn. They can. 
And we sure as hell are not going to 
be lectured about racism by the party 
that is trying to dismantle the Voting 
Rights Act that Martin Luther King 
and John Lewis paid for with their 
blood. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
ROYBAL-ALLARD), 
the 
distinguished 
chairwoman of the Committee on Ap-
propriations’ Subcommittee on Home-
land Security. 
Ms. 
ROYBAL-ALLARD. 
Madam 
Speaker, I support this rule and com-
mend the chairs who worked diligently 
to produce funding bills that reflect 
our goal to ‘‘Build Back Better’’ for the 
American people. 
As vice chair of the Subcommittee on 
Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies, I am 
delighted that this bill lives up to its 
reputation as the ‘‘People’s Bill,’’ 
thanks to the work and commitment of 
its chair, ROSA DELAURO. 
The bill has strong outlays in job 
training and apprenticeship programs, 
increased funding for childcare and 
worker protections, transformative in-
vestments to help adults in all commu-
nities 
access 
post-secondary 
edu-
cational opportunities, and critical in-
vestments to ensure our children can 
return to school safely and receive 
high-quality education to overcome 
the pandemic setbacks. 
The Labor, HHS, and Education bill 
has historic investments to strengthen 
our public health system and ensure 
the infrastructure and resources need-
ed to address future public health chal-
lenges. 
This includes increased investments 
in REACH, the Childhood Lead Poi-
soning Prevention Program, the Cli-
mate and Health Program, and the 
Chronic Disease Education and Aware-
ness Program. 
As co-chair of the Maternity Care 
Caucus, I am grateful for the strong in-
vestments in mothers and babies, like 
the large increases in the MCH block 
grant, the Healthy Start Program, and 
Safe Motherhood programs. I am also 
pleased the bill expands the capacity of 
the Maternal Mental Health Hotline, 
the 
SAMHSA 
Pregnant 
and 
Postpartum Women Program and mid-
wifery education funding within the 
Scholarships for Disadvantaged Stu-
dents. 
Madam Speaker, President Biden 
said: ‘‘Don’t tell me what you value. 
Show me your budget, and I will tell 
you what you value.’’ 
I thank all the subcommittee chairs 
for outlining our values so distinctly in 
their appropriation bills, and I urge 
passage of the rule and this minibus. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP), a passionate ad-
vocate on this issue, who will speak 
more about the previous question. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, we should defeat the 
previous question in order to imme-
diately consider H.R. 4698, Representa-
tive BURGESS OWENS’ bill, called the 
Say No to Indoctrination Act. 
The Nation has awakened to the in-
sidious ideology, or better said, the-
ology of critical race theory and its al-
lied neo-Marxian concepts, all spawned 
in the fringes of academia. 
After a few hardy individuals began 
focusing on this phenomenon, Ameri-
cans have discovered with growing 
alarm that it seems to be everywhere: 
in the media, in the workplace, in our 
armed 
services, 
in 
healthcare, 
in 
churches, and, yes, in the classrooms 
where our school children are taught. 
With this daunting realization, em-
ployees, soldiers, and moms and dads 
from all walks of life have been speak-
ing out. 
Now, the proponents of CRT are 
scrambling. Their first answer has been 
to play word games, to ridicule the no-
tion that the ideology is present. But 
whether couched as CRT, critical social 
justice, conflict theory, race essen-
tialism, intersectionality, White fra-
gility, or many other names, Ameri-
cans have seen it and they have caught 
on.

So the second line of defense—we just 
heard it—by the activists is to erect a 
straw man to falsely ascribe to those 
who confront CRT a motive to deny or 
conceal racial and group injustice in 
our history. 
But Americans are on to that as well. 
They know that at the core of critical 
race theory is the mission to indoctri-
nate people, especially young people, 
into the idea that our country is for-
ever locked into group conflict, espe-
cially racial conflict, so that the coun-
try, and certainly all White people, are 
irredeemably 
racists. 
It 
casts 
the 
American principles of individual lib-
erty, meritocracy, and free enterprise 
as systems of oppression. 
This condemns the progress our Na-
tion has made since first stating its 
founding principles. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, CRT has nothing to 
do with teaching accurate history. 
It is impossible to overstate the dan-
ger of indoctrinating Americans with 
the belief that their race, or other 
group membership, is the primary de-
terminant of their path in life. 
My friends, Mr. OWENS’ bill ensures 
that this poison is not funded with tax-
payer dollars. The U.S. Congress should 
catch up with the moms and dads con-
fronting school boards across the coun-
try. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on the previous question and to 
support Representative OWENS’ bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, think about what 
we are dealing with as we gather here 
on the House floor. We have a pan-
demic that we are trying to crush, we 
have a crumbling infrastructure, and 
what do my friends want to talk about? 
A FOX News talking point. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a July 23 ABC News article en-
titled: ‘‘Martin Luther King, Jr., the 
KKK, and More May Soon Be Cut from 
Texas Education Requirements.’’ 
[From ABC News, July 23, 2021] 
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., THE KKK, AND 
MORE MAY SOON BE CUT FROM TEXAS EDU-
CATION REQUIREMENT 
(By Kiara Alfonseca) 
Some lessons on the civil rights move-
ment, white supremacy, the women’s suf-
frage movement and Martin Luther King Jr. 
may soon be cut from Texas’ public edu-
cation requirements, according to legislation 
being considered in the state—one of several 
bills targeting critical race theory around 
the country. 
The Texas Senate has passed Senate Bill 3 
in a continued effort to proscribe education 
on racial inequality in K–12 education. It re-
moves several Texas Education Code lesson 
requirements that were proposed by Demo-
crats in prior education legislation to be im-
plemented in the upcoming school year. It 
also stipulates that lessons cannot teach 
that ‘‘one race or sex is inherently superior 
to another race or sex’’ or make students 
‘‘feel discomfort, guilt, [or] anguish’’ about 
privilege or systemic racism. 
The concept critical race theory, an aca-
demic discipline that analyzes how racism is 
perpetuated in U.S. laws and policies, has be-
come a lightning rod for conservatives 
around the country amid the racial reck-
oning spurred by George Floyd’s death. 
At least 26 other states have introduced or 
implemented similar legislation on race edu-
cation by Republican lawmakers, echoing 
concerns about racial division. 
Opponents say that children should not be 
made to feel responsible for past injustices 
based solely on the color of their skin or be 
forced to accept the idea that the United 
States and its institutions are not only 
structured racially but perpetuate that rac-
ism. 
Some teachers interviewed by ABC News 
have said critical race theory isn’t being 
taught in grades K–12 and instead is reserved 
for academic institutions. Some Texas edu-
cators told ABC they believe the fight 
against ‘‘critical race theory’’ is a veiled at-
tempt to turn back the clock on racial equal-
ity. 
The new legislation, SB3, would remove 
several staples of U.S. history education 
from state requirements, according to Ovidia 
Molina, the president of the Texas State 
Teachers Association. 
The state currently requires teaching ‘‘the 
history of white supremacy,’’ ‘‘the institu-
tion of slavery, the eugenics movement, and 
the Ku Klux Klan, and the ways in which it 
is morally wrong; the Chicano movement; 
women’s suffrage and equal rights; the civil 
rights movement’’ and more. 
However, SB3 would cut those require-
ments—a move that some teachers say sig-
nals a growing effort to remove specific les-
sons from classrooms. 
‘‘Specifically editing out that you can’t 
teach that white supremacy is morally 
wrong—that is deeply concerning,’’ said Jen-
nifer Lee, a teacher in Killeen, Texas. ‘‘I 
think the angle here is just . . . preserving 
the ideals behind white supremacy.’’ 
Though the new legislation doesn’t nec-
essarily ban these lessons from being taught, 
removing them from the list of requirements 
means they may come under scrutiny due to 
the vague, anticritical race theory language 
of this bill. 
Gov. Greg Abbott already signed anti-crit-
ical race theory into law in June with 
HB3979—stating that teachers are banned 
from linking systemic racism to the ‘‘au-
thentic founding principles of the United 
States.’’ But teachers and advocates say it is 
so vague that it could infringe on their abil-
ity to have truthful dialogue about history 
and racism with their students. 
SB3 was added to the state legislature’s 
special session after Abbott signed HB3979 
into law, saying said ‘‘more must be done’’ 
on critical race theory in schools. 
And SB3 has been called troubling by edu-
cation groups including the National Edu-
cation Association for its potential to censor 
teachers and students in the classroom. 
‘PROVIDE GUARDRAILS’ AGAINST ‘ANIMOSITY’ 
Defenders of the bill, including Republican 
state Sen. Bryan Hughes who sponsored the 
bill, say that some lessons on racial inequal-
ity blame white students for systemic racism 
and creates tension between students of dif-
ferent backgrounds. 
‘‘This bill is meant only to provide guard-
rails against imposing division and animos-
ity on our students,’’ Hughes said before the 
July 16 Senate vote. ‘‘Since [critical race 
theory] is so prevalent in higher education 
and since we see it popping up in public 
schools, that’s why it needs to be addressed.’’ 
Other proponents of anti-critical race the-
ory bills, such as Florida Gov. Ron Desantis, 
have said that some lessons on race could 
lead to the ‘‘indoctrination’’ of public school 
students 
toward 
progressive 
political 
leanings. 
Ovidia Molina, the president of the Texas 
State Teachers Association, said that stu-
dents have so much to gain from education 
about America’s racial history, including 
those that would be erased by this new legis-
lation. 
‘‘We want to keep honesty in education,’’ 
Molina said. ‘‘We want to make sure that we 
teach our students the truth, the whole 
truth, the good, the bad, the failures, the 
successes.’’ 
Molina said teachers have spoken up at 
hearings and called their local legislators to 
denounce the new legislation—but said law-
makers are not listening. 
‘‘They don’t know what’s happening in our 
public schools,’’ Molina said. ‘‘We still want 
to celebrate women’s suffrage, we still want 
to celebrate the Chicano movement, we still 
want to celebrate people of color, so that our 
students see themselves in the history and so 
they see themselves in the future.’’ 
The Texas Education Agency did not im-
mediately respond to requests for comment. 
Molina said that Texas districts have yet 
to announce what punishment for teaching 
these subjects might look like for teachers. 
CONCERNING SHIFT TOWARD ‘PATRIOTIC’ 
EDUCATION 
Some teachers told ABC they are worried 
about retaliation, termination, or other 
forms of punishment. But others are more 
concerned about what this shift toward more 
‘‘patriotic’’ education means for their stu-
dents. 
‘‘One of the first things Hitler did was 
start to reform education and impact the 
way that history is taught. One of the first 
things Mussolini did was go through and in-
corporate patriotic education,’’ Lee said. 
‘‘Education has always been that first line of 
defense in preserving a certain way of think-
ing.’’ 
Former President Donald Trump, among 
several other conservatives, have become 
proponents of ‘‘patriotic’’ education in re-
sponse to critical race theory and The New 
York Times’ 1619 project—which dissects the 
founding of the United States of America 
and its legacy of slavery. Trump’s proposed 
‘‘1776 commission’’ aims to envision U.S. his-
tory in a positive light, instead of through a 
condemnatory, racial lens. 
A school bus is seen outside Condit Ele-
mentary School in Bellaire, Texas, on Dec. 
16, 2020. San Antonio teacher Christopher 
Green said he believes that lessons on race, 
inequality and oppression are vital to help-
ing children navigate the world and under-
stand our society. 
‘‘Rather than adding a more diverse per-
spective to the teaching of history, it’s 
eliminating things that really need to be in 
there to understand the full picture of the 
American story,’’ Green said. 
The bill will now be headed to the state 
House, but it will likely be stalled due to 
protests from Texas Democratic representa-
tives. They have fled the state in protest of 
new voting restrictions, meaning there won’t 
be enough members to conduct business ac-
cording to House rules. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
many of my Republican colleagues 
think they can interfere with every-
thing from what our teachers teach in 
school to what happens between women 
and their doctors. 
This is from the party who pretends 
to be the party of local government.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3926 
July 27, 2021 
One of my colleagues on the Repub-
lican side in an interview yesterday 
said that we should have cameras in 
the classroom to monitor what teach-
ers do every single minute. So the 
party that claims to be the party of 
liberty and the party of local govern-
ment wants to be the party of super-big 
government and control everybody’s 
life. 
Give me a break. Let me close with 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. ROSS), a distinguished member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
favor of the rule and to highlight two 
amendments that I am offering to the 
minibus. 
In my home State of North Carolina, 
we lead the East Coast in offshore wind 
energy generation potential, and our 
manufacturing workforce stands ready 
to support offshore wind projects up 
and down the Atlantic coastline. 
Unfortunately, 
former 
President 
Trump issued a 10-year moratorium on 
offshore wind leasing off our coast that 
is set to take effect in 2022. This ill- 
conceived moratorium puts our State’s 
ability to develop this resource and 
capture its economic and environ-
mental benefits at risk. 
I am proud to offer an amendment to 
this bill, which would prohibit the use 
of funds to implement the offshore 
wind component of this moratorium 
while leaving the moratorium on off-
shore oil and gas leasing in place. 
This amendment, and a similar bill I 
introduced with Congressman TONKO, 
are essential in order to meet our State 
and national climate goals. 
My second amendment highlights the 
obstacles faced by pregnant and par-
enting students. Today, nearly 22 per-
cent of undergraduate students are par-
ents. Pregnant and parenting students 
face significant barriers in education, 
from difficulty accessing college, to in-
sufficient childcare, to lack of holistic 
supports. 
As a result, pregnant and parenting 
students experience disproportionately 
low graduation rates as well as a me-
dian debt that is nearly 21⁄2 times high-
er than that of students without chil-
dren. Pregnant and parenting high 
school students too frequently find 
themselves pushed out of school en-
tirely. 
My amendment instructs the Insti-
tute of Education Sciences to conduct 
a study on the obstacles pregnant and 
parenting students face in the pursuit 
of education and provides recommenda-
tions for improving educational out-
comes, including graduation rates for 
these students. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support the rule, my 
amendments, and the underlying bill. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS), my very good friend, a 
distinguished member of both the 
Rules Committee and the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
b 1300 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to demand of the majority 
that they restore the use of the resolu-
tion of inquiry. Resolutions of inquiry 
are used by the House to obtain infor-
mation from the executive branch. If a 
resolution of inquiry is not marked up 
in committee within 14 days, it be-
comes a privileged resolution on the 
House floor. 
Now, for a year the majority has 
turned off the tolling days for resolu-
tions of inquiry. They said this was be-
cause of the pandemic. But there is no 
need for this. Committees are open, 
committees are operating. The House 
floor votes have returned to near nor-
mal operations. 
This is a request for information. It 
is not an opinion. It is a request for in-
formation that we, as Members of the 
House, should have available from the 
administration. 
But if you want an opinion, yester-
day I introduced a resolution of inquiry 
directing the Departments of Home-
land Security and Health and Human 
Services to turn over information on 
the care of unaccompanied alien chil-
dren in the custody of Customs and 
Border Protection and the Office of 
Refugee Resettlement. This used to be 
something in which the majority was 
interested. 
There is a crisis along our southern 
border, and the Biden administration 
and the majority should see the impor-
tance of having transparency for the 
protection of these children that are, 
by law, under our care. 
I urge the majority to restore minor-
ity rights, and turn back on the tolling 
days for resolutions of inquiry. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just say that I think that it 
will be a lot easier for us to be able to 
accommodate the gentleman if he 
could control members of his own 
party from trying to disrupt and derail 
everything that we try to do here. 
Suspension votes, which are really 
pretty noncontroversial, that usually 
pass overwhelmingly, we have had to 
impose a new rule to be able to con-
sider them in order to be able to over-
come their objection to every single 
one of them. And now they are even ob-
jecting to that; bipartisan bills, Repub-
lican bills. 
Unfortunately, there is a concerted 
effort on behalf of some in the minor-
ity to try to stop all of the people’s 
business, and we are going to move for-
ward and get the people’s business 
done. That is what we are doing here 
today, and we will continue to do that. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. TRONE). 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank Chairman MCGOVERN
for 
yielding, and also for his leadership on 
the Rules Committee and, equally im-
portant, his relentless leadership in the 
House to help those that are unaccept-
ably hungry in America. 
I rise today as a member of the House 
Appropriations Committee to urge sup-
port for the rule and the bill, which in-
cludes important investments to fight 
our Nation’s substance use and mental 
health crisis, and significant funding 
for the National Institutes of Health. 
The COVID pandemic has only wors-
ened our Nation’s addiction and mental 
health epidemics. The data is alarm-
ing. Last year over 93,000 people died in 
America from an overdose. That is a 30 
percent increase in our country. This 
year more people are reporting fre-
quent thoughts of suicide and self- 
harm than ever before. 
Unlike COVID, there will be no vac-
cine for addiction, no vaccine for men-
tal health. 
It is going to take consistent, in-
creased funding to meet the needs of 
our most vulnerable Americans. I am 
happy to say this bill does that. I am 
also happy to have secured over $6 mil-
lion in this bill for critical projects in 
Maryland’s Sixth District that invest 
in important social services for the 
most vulnerable and job training in our 
community for those that need it the 
most. 
I want to thank Chair ROSA DELAURO 
for her work to lead this committee 
and invest long term in this important 
funding for our country. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH), my very good 
friend and the most distinguished de-
fender of life in the Congress. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, sadly the rule under consider-
ation precludes a vote on the Cole 
amendment 
to 
preserve 
the 
Hyde 
amendment and Weldon conscience 
protection law as well as other pro-life 
amendments, including one that I first 
successfully offered back in 1983 pro-
hibiting abortion funding in the Fed-
eral Employees Health Benefits pro-
gram. All of our amendments were 
ruled out of order. That is tragic; we 
are not even going to get to vote on 
these lifesaving measures. 
Madam Speaker, the Hyde amend-
ment has saved more than 2.4 million 
lives, about 60,000 per year since first 
enacted. If retained in law, more inno-
cent lives will be protected. 
It is time, I believe, for more of us to 
face the harsh reality of what abortion 
actually does to children. No one in the 
media ever bothers to expose the vio-
lent methods of abortion that include 
dismemberment of a child’s fragile 
body, 
including 
decapitation; 
that 
drugs like RU–486 starve the baby to 
death; or that unborn babies killed by 
abortion at 20 weeks or later experi-
ence excruciating physical pain, and 
until rendered unconscious or dead by

these hideous procedures, the baby 
feels the pain of every single cut. 
Madam Speaker, abortion is not 
healthcare unless one construes the 
precious life of an unborn child to be 
analogous to a tumor to be excised or 
a disease to be vanquished. 
Mr. Biden once wrote to constituents 
explaining his support for laws against 
funding for abortion by saying, ‘‘It 
would protect both the woman and her 
unborn child.’’ He went on to say that 
‘‘those of us who are opposed to abor-
tion should not be compelled to pay for 
them.’’ 
Over the years, the polls have con-
sistently shown that Americans do not 
support taxpayer funding of abortion. 
The January 2021 Marist poll found 
that 58 percent of Americans oppose 
taxpayer funding of abortion as op-
posed to 38 percent who support it. The 
Marist poll also found a supermajority 
of 65 percent Independents oppose tax-
payer funding of abortion. 
Madam Speaker, unborn babies need 
the President of the United States of 
America and Members of Congress on 
both sides of the aisle to be their 
friends and advocates, not powerful ad-
versaries. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, we can talk about 
polls. I have a poll here that just re-
cently came out that shows the exact 
opposite of that. 
But rather than talk about polls, we 
should be talking about values, and a 
majority of Americans believe that 
women should not be denied reproduc-
tive healthcare because they can’t af-
ford it. They believe that people should 
not be denied healthcare because, you 
know, they are working hard to try to 
make ends meet. 
So, I mean, here’s a poll that just 
came out that shows the exact opposite 
of that, an overwhelming majority of 
Americans 
believe 
that 
Medicaid 
should, in fact, cover women’s repro-
ductive healthcare. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. 
MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
rule and the underlying legislation, 
which funds key health, education, and 
other priorities that our Nation has 
simply underinvested in for much too 
long. 
I am particularly appreciative for the 
increased investments in TRIO—and I 
would mention that is a bipartisan ini-
tiative—and WIC—Women, Infant, and 
Children—among other things. 
I want to talk now about two amend-
ments that I have offered to this bill, 
which were made in order under this 
rule. The first is a bipartisan amend-
ment to increase the Low Income Heat-
ing Energy Assistance Program fund-
ing by $10 million. In the United 
States, 40 million households every 
year are unable to afford their basic 
household energy needs. 
I know in my State the temperature 
ranges between 55 degrees below zero to 
over 100 degrees. So it is not optional 
to have heating or cooling. 
In many cases this means choosing 
between food, medicine, and electricity 
needs to make ends meet, or leaving a 
home that is unsafe and unhealthy be-
cause of the upper or lower tempera-
tures. 
In Wisconsin, only 31 percent of eligi-
ble households received LIHEAP assist-
ance in 2020. Increasing the funding 
available for this program will help en-
sure that more of our most vulnerable 
citizens have adequate resources to 
prevent their energy needs from fur-
ther straining their budgets. 
The 
second 
amendment, 
Madam 
Speaker, would provide an additional 
$2 million for school breakfast expan-
sion grants included in the 2010 child 
nutrition reauthorization. I am so 
proud that the committee included $10 
million for this program in the under-
lying bill. Every child deserves a morn-
ing free of hunger and to have the op-
portunity to learn, grow, and focus in 
school without worrying where their 
next meal will come from. 
Currently, out of the 97,000 schools 
that participate in the school meals 
program, over 7,000 of them do not pro-
vide breakfast. With these additional 
funds, we can close the school break-
fast gap. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, with these funds we can close 
the school breakfast gap and ensure 
that all students receive breakfast who 
want it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the underlying bill. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. VAN
DREW), my good 
friend. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this shameful leg-
islation. 
This single vote encompasses seven 
unrelated spending bills. This is a bro-
ken legislative process. 
The bill includes poison pills that 
make it impossible for me and for my 
colleagues to support this in good con-
science. This is exactly as the majority 
intended. Today’s vote is simply an at-
tempt to strategically inflict political 
pain. 
Our country is tired, tired of political 
gamesmanship, tired of partisan ma-
neuvering, tired of this selfish dysfunc-
tion. 
On behalf of the American people, I 
ask the majority to stop. I must ask 
the majority to stop. There is an abil-
ity to work together. This is not it. 
If this were an earnest attempt at 
legislating, I could lend my support 
where appropriate. Unfortunately, I 
must oppose this rule and this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am very proud of 
this process. The shameful process was 
when my friend’s party was in control 
of the House and the White House, and 
they shut the government down. That 
is what people don’t want to see hap-
pen ever again. 
By the way, I mean, these bills do 
things like tackle hunger, they lift up 
our rural communities, they rebuild 
health and safety infrastructure, they 
invest incredibly important dollars in 
the National Institutes of Health and 
medical research to try to find cures 
for everything from Alzheimer’s to 
Parkinson’s disease, to get a better 
handle on how we can deal with future 
pandemics. It creates and sustains 
good-paying jobs, it grows opportuni-
ties through education. It advances 
equal treatment for women. 
There are so many important, good 
things in here that, by the way, I think 
are bipartisan everywhere in the coun-
try but in this Chamber, and so this is 
what the American people want. This 
is what they voted for. I am proud of 
the Appropriations Committee, Chair-
woman DELAURO, and all of those who 
put the American people front and cen-
ter on our agenda. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
LOIS FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this bill that invests in the love and 
commitment we have for our families, 
from the very young to the very old. 
It gets our children off to a good 
start with historic funding for pre-K 
and child care, and makes sure all chil-
dren have access to high-quality public 
education regardless of their ZIP Code. 
We want our children to have a 
chance to live out their dreams, so we 
make unprecedented investments in 
Pell grants for college students, includ-
ing DACA recipients. 
And our grandparents have given us 
so much. To help them age with dig-
nity and comfort, the bill increases 
funding for home and community-based 
services and research on Alzheimer’s 
and other conditions that impact older 
Americans. 
And, of course, we want our families 
to be safe and healthy, so this bill dou-
bles funding for research on gun vio-
lence, pluses-up mental health treat-
ment, and makes historic investments 
in combatting climate change and pro-
tecting Florida’s Everglades, drinking 
water for millions. 
And this is a country that honors our 
veterans. I am proud to champion Cen-
ters of Excellence for Student Veteran 
Success programs that help veterans 
transition from Active Duty to civilian 
student life. 
And today we celebrate reproductive 
freedom with historic investments in 
Title X Family Planning program, 
which provides health service to mil-
lions of low-income patients in our

most underserved communities, and we 
eliminate provisions blocking the use 
of Medicaid funding for abortion. 
No matter how we feel about abor-
tion, politicians should not deny some-
one’s health coverage just because they 
are 
struggling 
financially. 
Women 
must have the freedom to decide when 
and if to become a parent. This is mon-
umental. 
This is a bill filled with love and hope 
and justice that lifts up our families. I 
am proud to support it. 
b 1315 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
wish I could say I was rising in support 
of this legislation but, again, we are 
being asked to vote on a bill that rep-
resents a missed opportunity on the 
backs of our constituents. 
I am pleased I was able to secure 
needed improvement for DFW Airport 
in the appropriations legislation. These 
projects would not only improve my 
district but the whole region. 
I have held roundtables and formed a 
working group with local leaders and 
stakeholders who know what is best for 
my community and what I heard from 
them and fought to include in legisla-
tion funding our government is, sadly, 
not what we are debating today. 
Instead of working to craft bipar-
tisan legislation which Members on 
both sides of the aisle can support, the 
Senate can pass, and the President can 
sign into law, we are, instead, debating 
monstrous appropriations bills that are 
based 
on 
unrealistic, 
irresponsible 
funding levels and include partisan pol-
icy provisions that will only delay 
funding and passage. 
These political games only serve to 
impede badly needed infrastructure 
projects. No, the Democrats didn’t shut 
down the government, they just tried 
to shut down the rest of the country. I 
would love to be able to work on legis-
lation that we can work on together 
that will actually advance what we are 
trying to do in this country. I urge op-
position to this rule. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI). 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to defend the dignity of life and 
the rights of pro-life Americans. We 
must protect taxpayers from being 
forced to fund abortion against their 
own conscience. 
The Hyde amendment which pro-
hibits taxpayer dollars for paying for 
abortion has had bipartisan consensus 
since 1976 and the majority of Ameri-
cans still support it today. This pro-life 
protection has saved nearly 2.5 million 
lives. 
Driven by a radical agenda, Demo-
crats and the Biden administration 
have stripped this vital amendment 
from these appropriation packages. It 
is incredibly disappointing that Demo-
crats want to force American tax-
payers to bankroll the destruction of 
life. 
I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 18, the 
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, 
which would make this prohibition the 
law of the land. Pro-life Americans 
must stand together to protect the 
most vulnerable among us. Lives are 
depending on us. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
rule and the underlying bill to prevent 
taxpayer funding from paying for abor-
tions. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. SMITH), my very good friend 
and the ranking member of the Budget 
Committee. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Oklahoma for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, we are debating a 
spending bill under a budget that 
doesn’t exist. Six months into Joe 
Biden’s Presidency and a Democrat- 
controlled Congress, we have still not 
passed a budget for fiscal year 2022. In 
fact, Democrats have been in the ma-
jority for over 1,000 days and they have 
yet to put a real budget on the floor of 
the House of Representatives. 
In this bill before us today, the 
Democrats want to give Washington 
bureaucrats an average increase of 21 
percent. Their plan will fuel a massive 
growth in red tape that will harm 
small businesses. It will hurt working 
Americans and families, and it gives 
Washington more control over their 
lives and livelihoods. 
But notice what they have left out. 
What they have left out is, where is 
the money to protect our homeland? 
Where is the money for our men and 
women in uniform? 
Perhaps our colleagues have not 
brought these bills to the floor because 
they are ashamed to face the American 
people and explain why they want to 
flatline spending for our men and 
women in uniform. 
Or how, during the largest and worst 
immigration crisis of the southern bor-
der in years, they refuse to put in one 
additional dollar to secure our border. 
I suppose this shouldn’t surprise us. 
Democrats have been very, very clear 
about their objectives. While we are de-
bating a raise for bureaucrats, the Sen-
ate is figuring out how to abuse the 
budget process to spend at least $3.5 
trillion more on their socialist agenda: 
amnesty for millions of illegal immi-
grants; subsidies for wealthy environ-
mentalists; forcing States to expand 
Medicaid; and tax increases for work-
ing Americans while giving tax breaks 
for the wealthiest Americans. 
This is the first year in the last dec-
ade without a spending cap agreement 
and look what is happening. Without 
missing a beat, the Democrats are 
opening the floodgates to reckless 
spending. While they argue over how 
many trillions to spend, we are just 
days away from reaching our debt 
limit. Democrats have ignored run-
away government spending this year 
and look what is happening: Americans 
are paying more at the pump and in 
the checkout lines than they have in 
years. 
The debate around our Nation’s debt 
limit provides Congress with the oppor-
tunity to seriously address runaway 
government spending and rising infla-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 15 sec-
onds. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. But as we 
are here today, Democrats would rath-
er bypass their budget process and talk 
about their liberal wish list. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
People always ask: Why don’t you 
work together? How do you work with 
that? To come down here and to lec-
ture us about deficits or about budgets, 
give me a break. 
When the gentleman’s party was in 
power, when they controlled the House, 
the Senate, and the White House, they 
gave us a $2 trillion debt because of a 
tax cut that went to wealthy people, to 
big corporations. 
When they controlled the House, the 
Senate, and the White House, they shut 
the government down. They couldn’t 
even agree amongst themselves. It was 
the first time in history that we ended 
a Congress with a government shut-
down. 
When they lost power, they gave 
Democrats a government that was shut 
down. We had to clean up the mess, and 
we continue to do that. 
In all of the years of disinvestment 
when they were in charge with Donald 
Trump, we are now trying to put the 
people first. That is what this is about. 
I am proud of this bill. I am proud of 
the investments in medical research, in 
our families, in our children, in our 
senior citizens, and in our veterans. 
That is what this is all about. These 
bills are being brought to the floor. 
I hate to tell the gentleman that is 
what we are doing; they are coming to 
the floor. He can vote ‘‘no’’ on them 
and go home and explain to his con-
stituents why he voted against their 
interests, but that is what we are 
doing. And I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I would 
advise the gentleman that I am pre-
pared to close whenever he is. Madam 
Speaker, can I inquire how much time 
remains? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oklahoma has 51⁄4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I want to begin by thanking my good 
friend, Mr. MCGOVERN, the chairman of

the Rules Committee, as we always 
have a spirited debate and lively ex-
change and we don’t always agree on 
things, but I always appreciate his 
faith in the institution, his willingness 
to engage in debate, and his friendship 
and decency as we work through our 
differences. 
Madam Speaker, the bill before us 
today is a deeply misguided bill. I say 
that as someone who serves on the Ap-
propriations Committee. The spending 
package covering seven different ap-
propriations bills is marked to num-
bers that simply don’t make sense. 
Contrary to what my friend claimed, 
we haven’t had a massive disinvest-
ment in domestic spending over the 
last 4 years. Quite the opposite. There 
have been steady and, I think, genu-
inely merited increases. This is an ex-
plosion of spending tied to additional 
spending that is promised down the 
road in the form of a $3.5 trillion rec-
onciliation bill. 
Now, everything is funded except, as 
my good friend from Missouri said, the 
things that keep us safe and free. The 
defense budget is laughable. We have 
had a succession of Secretaries—on 
both sides of the aisle, by the way— 
who have told us we need a 3 to 5 per-
cent increase beyond inflation in de-
fense over the next several years. 
We don’t have a defense bill on the 
floor. We are not likely to see one any 
time soon, but the reality is, the de-
fense bill my friends propose actually 
is an inflation-adjusted cut in the de-
fense of the United States, a cut at a 
time that we are dealing with Russian 
and Chinese aggression and dangerous 
adventurism in other parts of the world 
by regional adversaries like North 
Korea and Iran. That is irresponsible. 
We all know we have a crisis on the 
southern border. We won’t see the 
Homeland Security bill either because 
that is flat funded and not meeting the 
obvious needs that we have there. But 
we do have an extraordinary explosion 
in domestic spending, one that is sim-
ply not justified and can’t be sustained. 
If those were my only objections, I 
would think at some point we could 
probably find some sort of reasonable 
compromise, because my friends know 
at the end of the day they have to get 
to 60 votes in the United States Senate. 
However, in addition to that, they have 
ripped out things like the Hyde and 
Weldon amendments that have been in 
these bills for 45 years, in the case of 
the Hyde amendment, 15 or 16 years in 
the case of the Weldon amendment. 
Those are deal-breaking bills to us. 
Now, my friends have routinely voted 
for those things for decades; not for 
years but for decades, and Presidents of 
both parties have signed them. As I 
have mentioned to my friends yester-
day in the Rules Committee, it was a 
Democratic Congress that passed the 
Hyde 
amendment, 
overwhelmingly 
Democrat in both Chambers. 
My friends have changed their view 
about the life issue. That is their right. 
I respect it. We have not. We have not 
changed 
our 
views 
on 
conscience 
issues. My friends know that if that 
language in the Hyde amendment and 
the Weldon amendment are not re-
stored to the appropriations bills, they 
are not going to have any of these 
grand bills or even compromise bills. 
They are going to end up with a con-
tinuing resolution, at best. 
For those people who are watching 
that don’t know what a continuing res-
olution is, it is simply last year’s 
spending with the Weldon and Hyde 
amendments. In effect, a Democratic 
President, a Democratic House, and a 
Democratic Senate will have produced 
Donald Trump’s last-negotiated budg-
et. That is where we are headed unless 
my friends decide to restore that lan-
guage. That is an absolute deal-breaker 
for us if it is not. 
The other thing that I would mention 
to my good friends on the other side is 
that there is still some time to do some 
things. This is a long process, and I un-
derstand setting out your negotiating 
position. But let’s not be under any il-
lusion that what we are talking about 
today will ever become law. It will 
never be passed by the Senate. It will 
never reach the desk of the President 
of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my friends to 
reject the rule, reject the bill, and sit 
down and bargain in good faith. We can 
get there. 
As I have said on many occasions, I 
have had the great privilege of having 
been chairman and ranking member of 
the largest component bill in this 
group. On six different occasions, both 
as chairman and ranking member, 
working with my good friend, the 
chairwoman of the full committee, 
Representative DELAURO, we came to a 
deal. All six times, the bill was out of 
committee, across the floor, signed by 
the President. It didn’t matter who was 
chairman or ranking member. It didn’t 
matter 
which 
party 
controlled. 
It 
didn’t matter who the President was. 
That is six times in a row. We can do 
that again a seventh time in this bill. 
There are some good things in this bill, 
as my friend says, some things I cer-
tainly support. But there can be such a 
thing as too much of a good thing, and 
there is way too much of a good thing 
in this bill in terms of the amount of 
money it spends. 
At the end of the day, if we are going 
to have an appropriations process that 
works, if we are going to have a deal— 
and we both should want a deal—then 
the defense number is going to have to 
come up. The discretionary spending 
number, which is embodied in this bill, 
is going to have to come down, and the 
Hyde and Weldon amendments are 
going to have to be restored. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
earlier I referred to when one of my Re-
publican colleagues came to the floor 
and had a meltdown. I commented: 
How do you work with that? Coming to 
the floor and yelling and screaming 
and scolding and distorting and trying 
to find the worst possible version of ev-
erything, that never accomplishes any-
thing. It never does. 
Madam Speaker, I would never char-
acterize my colleague from Oklahoma 
that way. When we get to a final prod-
uct, he will be part of the solution be-
cause he respects this institution, and 
he understands the importance of give 
and take. We have some very strong 
disagreements in the Rules Committee 
but I never question his integrity, and 
he never questions my integrity or 
anybody else’s on the committee. I 
wish there were more people like him, 
quite frankly, in this Chamber. 
b 1330 
Madam Speaker, to hear some of my 
friends on the other side today, you 
would think that the sky is falling. 
What is so controversial about trust-
ing 
women 
to 
make 
their 
own 
healthcare decisions, free from politi-
cians and special interest groups trying 
to control them? 
What is so controversial about con-
fronting climate change, or making 
America the world’s clean energy su-
perpower? 
Or helping our farmers in our rural 
communities? 
Or making sure our veterans have 
the support and the care that they 
have earned when they return home? 
Apparently, since Democrats pro-
posed it, this minibus is a bridge too 
far for some. But I have to tell you, to 
most Americans, what is included here 
is just common sense. 
I am proud that we are doing our 
work and keeping our government 
funded, and doing so in a way that re-
spects women’s autonomy and builds a 
more just and equitable future. 
Madam Speaker, too many of these 
issues can’t wait another day, another 
year, another decade for us to act, so I 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
this rule and this minibus so that we 
can meet the scale of the challenges 
that we face today and put the building 
blocks in place to grow our economy 
for years to come. That is what these 
bills are all about. 
Someone earlier described them as 
bills filled with hope and love. They 
are. This is about putting our families 
first. This is about respecting our kids, 
understanding that our children are 100 
percent of our future. This is about un-
derstanding that we have a climate cri-
sis, and we have to do something about 
it. This is about respecting equity and 
justice and things that, quite frankly, 
should be shared values. 
Madam Speaker, I know that there 
are some disagreements here. We will 
all get through this, work it out, and 
get to a conclusion, but the final prod-
uct will be much, much better because 
of what we are doing on this House 
floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the rule and the un-
derlying bill. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows:

least 15 days before operationalizing an unli-
censed facility, and shall (1) specify whether the

vide analysis that indicates that, in the absence 
of the influx facility, the likely outcome is that 
unaccompanied alien children will remain in the 
custody of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity for longer than 72 hours or that unaccom-
panied alien children will be otherwise placed in 
danger. Within 60 days of bringing such a facil-
ity online, and monthly thereafter, the Sec-
retary shall provide to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of the House of Representatives

ber of children in care at the facility, the aver-

ducting oversight, any facility in the United 
States used for the purpose of maintaining cus-
tody of, or otherwise housing, unaccompanied 
alien children (as defined in section 462(g)(2) of 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.

after, the Secretary shall submit to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate, and make publicly

such separation was pursuant to an option se-
lected by the children, parents, or guardians), 
subsequently classified as unaccompanied alien 
children, and transferred to the care and cus-
tody of ORR during the previous month. Each 
report shall contain the following information: 
(1) the number and ages of children so sepa-
rated subsequent to apprehension at or between

clude the transmission of information described 
in such subsection to any individual, entity, or

movement to a different covered position only if 
that new position has higher-level duties and a 
pre-established level or range of pay higher 
than the level or range for the position held im-
mediately before the movement. Any such in-
crease must be based on the rates of pay and ap-
plicable limitations on payable rates of pay in 
effect on December 31, 2021, by operation of sec-
tion 748 of division E of Public Law 116–260. 
(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, for an individual who is newly appointed 
to a covered position during the period of time 
subject to this section, the initial pay rate shall 
be based on the rates of pay and applicable limi-
tations on payable rates of pay in effect on De-
cember 31, 2021, by operation of section 748 of 
division E of Public Law 116–260. 
(k) If an employee affected by this section is

served at the existing Bureau-funded school,

(b) For purposes of determining the eligibility 
of a person to receive assistance under section 8

ants and the local government that such a mul-
tifamily property owned or having a mortgage

shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that 
project-based contracts remain in effect prior to 
foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contrac-
tual abatement remedies to assist relocation of 
tenants for imminent major threats to health 
and safety after written notice to and informed 
consent of the affected tenants and use of other 
available remedies, such as partial abatements 
or receivership. After disposition of any multi-
family property described in this section, the 
contract and allowable rent levels on such prop-
erties shall be subject to the requirements under 
section 524 of MAHRAA. 
SEC. 213. Public housing agencies that own 
and operate 400 or fewer public housing units

ment requirement imposed by the Secretary in

fund formula shall not be exempt from asset 
management requirements.

ment of public housing as authorized by sections 
9(d) and 9(e) of the United States Housing Act

shall not impose any requirement or guideline 
relating to asset management that restricts or 
limits in any way the use of capital funds for 
central office costs pursuant to paragraph (1) or 
(2) of section 9(g) of the United States Housing 
Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)): Provided,

ital funds authorized under section 9(d) for ac-
tivities that are eligible under section 9(e) for as-
sistance with amounts from the operating fund 
in excess of the amounts permitted under para-
graph (1) or (2) of section 9(g). 
SEC. 215. No official or employee of the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development 
shall be designated as an allotment holder un-
less the Office of the Chief Financial Officer has 
determined that such allotment holder has im-
plemented an adequate system of funds control 
and has received training in funds control pro-
cedures and directives. The Chief Financial Of-
ficer shall ensure that there is a trained allot-
ment holder for each HUD appropriation under 
the accounts ‘‘Executive Offices’’, ‘‘Administra-
tive Support Offices’’, ‘‘Program Offices’’, ‘‘Gov-
ernment National Mortgage Association—Guar-
antees of Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan 
Guarantee Program Account’’, and ‘‘Office of 
Inspector General’’ within the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. 
SEC. 216. The Secretary shall, for fiscal year 
2022, notify the public through the Federal Reg-
ister and other means, as determined appro-
priate, of the issuance of a notice of the avail-
ability of assistance or notice of funding oppor-
tunity (NOFO) for any program or discretionary 
fund administered by the Secretary that is to be 
competitively awarded. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, for fiscal year 2022, the 
Secretary may make the NOFO available only 
on the Internet at the appropriate Government 
website or through other electronic media, as de-
termined by the Secretary.

gram-related litigation shall be paid from the in-

not apply to such units assisted under section

spection, the Secretary shall provide the owner 
with a Notice of Default with a specified time-
table, determined by the Secretary, for cor-
recting all deficiencies. The Secretary shall pro-
vide a copy of the Notice of Default to the ten-
ants, the local government, any mortgagees, and 
any contract administrator. If the owner’s ap-
peal results in a UPCS score of 60 or above, the 
Secretary may withdraw the Notice of Default. 
(2) At the end of the time period for correcting 
all deficiencies specified in the Notice of De-
fault, if the owner fails to fully correct such de-
ficiencies, the Secretary may— 
(A) require immediate replacement of project 
management with a management agent ap-
proved by the Secretary; 
(B) impose civil money penalties, which shall 
be used solely for the purpose of supporting safe 
and sanitary conditions at applicable properties, 
as designated by the Secretary, with priority 
given to the tenants of the property affected by 
the penalty; 
(C) abate the section 8 contract, including 
partial abatement, as determined by the Sec-
retary, until all deficiencies have been corrected; 
(D) pursue transfer of the project to an owner, 
approved by the Secretary under established 
procedures, who will be obligated to promptly 
make all required repairs and to accept renewal 
of the assistance contract if such renewal is of-
fered; 
(E) transfer the existing section 8 contract to 
another project or projects and owner or own-
ers; 
(F) pursue exclusionary sanctions, including 
suspensions or debarments from Federal pro-
grams; 
(G) seek judicial appointment of a receiver to 
manage the property and cure all project defi-
ciencies or seek a judicial order of specific per-
formance requiring the owner to cure all project 
deficiencies; 
(H) work with the owner, lender, or other re-
lated party to stabilize the property in an at-
tempt to preserve the property through compli-

(I) take any other regulatory or contractual 
remedies available as deemed necessary and ap-
propriate by the Secretary. 
(d) The Secretary shall take appropriate steps 
to ensure that project-based contracts remain in 
effect, subject to the exercise of contractual 
abatement remedies to assist relocation of ten-
ants for major threats to health and safety after 
written notice to the affected tenants. To the ex-
tent the Secretary determines, in consultation 
with the tenants and the local government, that 
the property is not feasible for continued rental 
assistance payments under such section 8 or 
other programs, based on consideration of— 
(1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating 
the property and all available Federal, State, 
and local resources, including rent adjustments 
under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted 
Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 
(‘‘MAHRAA’’); and 
(2) environmental conditions that cannot be 
remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Sec-
retary may contract for project-based rental as-
sistance payments with an owner or owners of 
other existing housing properties, or provide 
other rental assistance. 
(e) The Secretary shall report quarterly on all 
properties covered by this section that are as-
sessed through the Real Estate Assessment Cen-
ter and have UPCS physical inspection scores of 
less than 60 or have received an unsatisfactory 
management and occupancy review within the 
past 36 months. The report shall include— 
(1) identification of the enforcement actions 
being taken to address such conditions, includ-
ing imposition of civil money penalties and ter-
mination of subsidies, and identification of 
properties that have such conditions multiple 
times; 
(2) identification of actions that the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development is tak-
ing to protect tenants of such identified prop-
erties; and 
(3) any administrative or legislative rec-
ommendations to further improve the living con-
ditions at properties covered under a housing 
assistance payment contract.

otherwise replaces a mortgage that has been 
subject to eminent domain condemnation or sei-
zure, by a State, municipality, or any other po-
litical subdivision of a State.

SEC. 227. (a) From amounts made available 
under this title under the heading ‘‘Homeless

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill,

their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) and the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the measure 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. Though, to consume time is not 
what I am here to do today. To con-
sume time is a luxury that we can no 
longer afford. 
Madam Speaker, after decades of dis-
investment and the devastation of the 
pandemic, the time is now to reinvest 
in the American people. The time is 
now to create jobs, grow opportunity, 
and support our Nation’s most vulner-
able. The time is now to meet the 
moral test of government. 
Vice President Hubert Humphrey de-
fined this test by how government 
treats ‘‘those who are in the dawn of 
life . . . , those who are in the twilight 
of life . . . , and those who are in the 
shadows of life.’’ 
As I have led the Committee on Ap-
propriations over the past 6 months, 
this idea has served as a guiding light. 
It has challenged us to dig deeply into 
the areas of greatest need and to pro-
vide every American the opportunity 
to contribute and succeed. 
I believe the package of seven appro-
priations bills before us, H.R. 4502, will 
not only pass this moral test, it will 
fulfill 
the 
sacred 
mission 
we 
are 
charged with as a body to leave this 
Nation stronger and better than we 
found it. 
With investments in education, nu-
trition assistance, and rural and under-
served communities, we are providing 
every American the resources they 
need. By rebuilding our Nation’s infra-
structure and confronting the climate 
crisis, we are creating and sustaining 
good-paying American jobs. And with 
renewed urgency to protect our democ-
racy, close racial disparities, and ad-
vance women’s rights, we are building 
back better and fostering a brighter fu-
ture. We are meeting the moment and 
more than meeting Hubert Humphrey’s 
moral test. 
As chair of the Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee, I want 
to take a moment to turn to the in-
vestments we are making in this legis-
lation more specifically to lift up the 
most vulnerable and prepare our Na-
tion for future challenges. 
The $253.8 billion we provide in the 
Labor-HHS bill represents a historic 
increase of 28 percent. It includes $7.4 
billion for the Child Care and Develop-
ment Block Grant, $12.2 billion for 
Head Start, nearly a $20 billion in-
crease in Federal support for high-pov-
erty schools, and record funding for 
students with disabilities. 
It provides continued support for so-
cial and emotional learning and makes 
post-secondary education more afford-
able with a $400 increase for the max-
imum Pell grant. It includes $1.1 bil-
lion for programs serving historically 
Black colleges and universities, minor-
ity-serving 
institutions, 
community 
colleges, and underresourced institu-
tions of higher education. And it pro-
vides $100 million for the Strength-
ening Community Colleges Training 
Grant program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4047 
July 27, 2021 
To give workers the skills and pro-
tections they need, this bill includes an 
increase of $1.6 billion for the Employ-
ment and Training Administration, in-
cluding a total of $285 million for reg-
istered apprenticeships and $3.1 billion 
for Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act State grants, and $2.1 bil-
lion for worker protection agencies. 
This bill heeds the lessons of the pan-
demic by providing record funding for 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, including $1 billion for 
public health infrastructure and capac-
ity. It invests $6.5 billion in the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, which were 
crucial in developing the COVID–19 
vaccine in record time, including an in-
crease of $3.5 billion for biomedical re-
search at existing NIH institutes and 
centers. And it supports the Presi-
dent’s request to establish the Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency for 
Health, or ARPA-H, which will be in-
dispensable in achieving breakthroughs 
in the treatment of diseases, such as 
diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease. 
This bill further provides $100 million 
to help communities create a new men-
tal health crisis response partnership 
pilot program in partnership with our 
law enforcement agencies. And it pro-
vides $50 million for gun violence pre-
vention research at the NIH and the 
CDC. 
Finally, this bill ensures equal treat-
ment for women by repealing the dis-
criminatory Hyde amendment and sup-
ports the more than 3 million men, 
women, and young adults who receive 
the full range of family planning and 
reproductive health services funded by 
Title X. 
I have just scratched the surface of 
the historic and unprecedented invest-
ments contained in this funding pack-
age, which together meet this moment 
and, I believe, faithfully fulfill the 
moral test of government. 
I thank all the subcommittee chairs, 
the ranking members, and all the mem-
bers of the Committee on Appropria-
tions and their staffs for their hard 
work on these bills. 
In particular, I must note my deep 
appreciation for my partnership with 
Ranking Member COLE; my partnership 
with the ranking member of the full 
committee, Congresswoman GRANGER; 
and my gratitude for the Labor-HHS 
staff led by Stephen Steigleder, and in-
cluding Jared Bass, Philip Tizzani, Jen-
nifer Cama, Jackie Kilroy, Laurie 
Mignone, Becky Salay, and Trisha 
Castaneda. Thank you as well to the 
minority staff, Susan Ross and Kath-
ryn Salmon. Last but not least, I must 
thank my personal staff, including Liz 
Albertine, Christian Lovell, Caitlin 
Peruccio, and Marie Gualtieri. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
the bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume and rise today in strong opposi-
tion to H.R. 4502, a package of seven 
fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills 
that will be considered this week. 
I wish the circumstances were dif-
ferent and I could support this impor-
tant piece of legislation that funds 
critical programs. Unfortunately, after 
months of committee hearings and 
markups, this year’s bills have too 
many fatal flaws. 
First, there is no agreement between 
Republicans and Democrats on the top- 
line spending level for appropriations. 
Second, there is no bipartisan agree-
ment on the funding level for each in-
dividual bill. To put it simply, non-
defense spending is too high and de-
fense spending is too low. 
Third, our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have included the most 
alarming policy changes I have ever 
seen. 
While acknowledging the hard work 
of 
Chair 
DELAURO
and 
her 
sub-
committee chairs, this package does 
not reflect the type of bipartisan agree-
ment that we must have to complete 
the appropriations process this year. 
Instead of crafting legislation both 
sides of the aisle can support, the bills 
included in the package were written 
to address the most extreme views in 
the majority party. 
At a time of record-high deficits and 
debt, now is not the time to double 
down on increasing domestic spending. 
Here are just a few examples of the 
excess spending included in this pack-
age: a 36 percent increase for the 
Labor-HHS bill; a 39 percent increase 
for the White House; and a 22 percent 
increase for the Vice President’s office. 
All of this comes at a time when we 
are seeing inflation rise at the fastest 
pace in 13 years. For the sake of gen-
erations to come, we can’t afford to 
spend like this. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
unrealistic 
spending levels, the majority has made 
questionable policy decisions that will 
complicate any attempts to come to a 
bipartisan agreement. For example, 
their funding priorities will reverse the 
gains in energy independence that we 
have made over the past decade and 
will actually increase our dependence 
on China for critical minerals. 
Another area that is particularly 
concerning is that this bill fails to in-
clude longstanding language prohib-
iting the transfer of detainees cur-
rently at Guantanamo Bay to the 
United States. These detainees are the 
worst of the worst, and we need assur-
ance that they will not be moved to 
our soil. 
Finally, the most startling position 
taken in this bill is the deliberate re-
moval of the Hyde amendment and 
other longstanding bipartisan provi-
sions to protect life. The bill also pro-
vides funds for the largest Planned 
Parenthood affiliate in the country, 
which performs thousands of abortions 
each year. 
This is not the way to do business if 
we want to enact full-year appropria-
tions bills this year. With the House 
only planning to be in session and vot-
ing for 12 more legislative days before 
the end of the fiscal year, we have a lot 
of work to do and little time to do it. 
We must develop top-line spending lev-
els that both sides can support. 
We have countless policy differences 
that will take time to resolve, and pro-
tecting the lives of unborn children 
must be the first step. 
If we want to avoid a long-term con-
tinuing resolution—or worse, a govern-
ment shutdown—we must get serious 
and do the work our constituents sent 
us here to do. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this package, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the chair of 
the Committee on Appropriations’ Sub-
committee on Energy and Water Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chair DELAURO for yielding, and 
I thank her for her leadership of this 
really great and historic committee. 
The 
Energy 
and 
Water 
division 
makes significant investments to se-
cure the imperative of U.S. energy 
independence in perpetuity to foster 
world-class scientific innovation and 
address the crisis of climate change. 
Not only does our bill meet the needs 
of the current moment, it provides a 
firmer foundation to build back better. 
Headlines tell a clear story. NBC 
News reported: ‘‘The West catches fire 
while the East goes underwater as cli-
mate change fuels both extremes.’’ As 
these extreme conditions spread across 
our country, our goal must be to pro-
vide the necessary energy and water 
assets to help sustain life on our corner 
of Mother Earth. 
Our bill invests over $53 billion to 
provide strategic resources to address 
these challenges while creating good- 
paying, middle-class jobs in commu-
nities across this country, with a 
greater commitment to those too often 
left behind. 
b 1530 
Let me walk through key invest-
ments in this bill. 
Madam Speaker, $45.1 billion is for 
the Department of Energy, $3.2 billion 
above enacted. Within the Department 
of Energy, the Office of Energy Effi-
ciency 
and 
Renewable 
Energy—so 
much a part of our future—receives 
record funding of $3.7 billion, $906 mil-
lion above enacted. 
In the weatherization programs, they 
received $398 million, $83 million above 
enacted. That means thousands more 
homes retrofitted. ARPA-E receives 
$600 million, $173 million above en-
acted. The Office of Science—world- 
class science—receives $7.32 billion, 
$294 million above enacted. We respon-
sibly fund our nuclear deterrent and in-
crease 
funding 
for 
nonproliferation 
programs. 
The Army Corps receives $8.6 billion, 
$1.9 billion above the budget request, to 
support our Nation’s water infrastruc-
ture and dredge ports and harbors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4048 
July 27, 2021 
The Bureau of Reclamation receives 
$1.9 billion, $413 million above the 
budget request, including $191 million 
to address the western drought. 
Our bill increases funding for re-
gional commissions which promote 
economic development in distressed 
communities. 
In short, this bill meets our responsi-
bility to sustain life on Earth by pro-
viding critical funding for water infra-
structure, clean energy, the highest 
level of scientific innovation, and a 
credible nuclear deterrent while sup-
porting the creation of good paying 
jobs in every region of our country. 
I also wish to, in closing, thank my 
dear staff for their very hard work be-
ginning with Jaime Shimek, our chief 
clerk; Angie Giancarlo, serving the 
ranking member and the Republican 
side of the aisle; Mike Brain; Scott 
McKee; Brian Smith; Will Ostertag; 
Lauren 
Leuck; 
and, 
finally, 
Matt 
Kaplan of my own staff who will be 
going on to work with the National Re-
sources Defense Council, and we will 
miss him so very much. 
Ms. DELAURO. I reserve the balance 
of my time, Madam Speaker. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON), who is the rank-
ing member of the Energy and Water 
Development, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in re-
luctant opposition to H.R. 4502, the 
seven-bill fiscal year 2022 appropria-
tions package that includes the Energy 
and Water Development appropriations 
bill. I had hoped to be able to support 
the appropriations bill this year. Un-
fortunately, the overall funding frame-
work for these bills lacks bipartisan 
support. The House framework includes 
massive increases for non-defense pro-
grams and shortchanges our national 
security needs. 
Taken in isolation, there are many 
things in the Energy and Water bill 
that House Republicans could support. 
For example, strong support for the 
Corps of Engineers, including specific 
community project funding and addi-
tional programmatic funding, is a bi-
partisan priority. 
Of great importance to me, of course, 
is the Department of Energy’s nuclear 
energy program. I appreciate Chair-
woman KAPTUR’s efforts to address 
many of my priorities within this ac-
count. 
In particular, I am pleased to see in-
creased funding to continue three dem-
onstration projects under the Advanced 
Small Modular Reactor and Advanced 
Reactors Demonstration programs, as 
well as continued work on microreac-
tors, including the MARVEL program. 
Also notable is the support for ensur-
ing a supply of high-assay, low-en-
riched uranium, or HALEU, that will 
be the fuel that will be used by many of 
the next generation of reactors. The 
Department of Energy will serve as an 
essential, temporary source of HALEU 
until the commercial market can be es-
tablished. 
While I support the focus on dem-
onstrating new technologies, I am dis-
appointed to see that the bill does not 
also continue support for the Versatile 
Test Reactor. The VTR will be a valu-
able domestic testing facility for many 
advanced 
technologies. 
Continuing 
work now, even if at a slower pace than 
was originally planned, will allow us to 
benefit from collaboration with one of 
the demonstration projects. 
I was pleased to join Congressman 
WEBER in offering an amendment to 
highlight the importance of the VTR, 
and I urge the full House to adopt it. I 
look forward to working with my col-
leagues to support progress on the VTR 
as soon as possible. 
Unfortunately, the bill before us 
underfunds 
our 
national 
security 
needs. An increase of less than 1 per-
cent for weapons activities does not 
even keep up with inflation. And while 
the budget request was itself insuffi-
cient, the bill before us does not even 
meet the budget request for certain 
stockpile sustainment and major modi-
fication programs. We must uphold our 
Nation’s strong national deterrence 
posture, and to do that we must ade-
quately fund the activities necessary 
to maintain a safe, reliable, and effec-
tive stockpile. 
In closing, I would like to thank 
Chairwoman KAPTUR
for putting to-
gether this year’s Energy and Water 
bill in her typical cooperative style. It 
is clear that she and the majority staff 
worked hard to address individual 
Members’ priorities from both sides of 
the aisle, and I thank her for that con-
sideration. 
I would also like to thank Chair-
woman DELAURO and Ranking Member 
GRANGER
of the full committee for 
their leadership and support of the im-
portant programs in this bill. 
I look forward to working together as 
the bill moves through the legislative 
process to develop a final Energy and 
Water bill that reflects a balanced set 
of priorities that can be supported by 
Members on both sides of the aisle. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), who is the 
chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Transportation, 
and 
Housing 
and 
Urban Development, and Related Agen-
cies. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
critical legislation. I want to start by 
thanking my partner, Ranking Member 
MARIO DIAZ-BALART, for his collabora-
tion and his cooperation, which have 
made this a better bill reflecting many 
bipartisan priorities which we can 
proudly support. 
Division G, the T-HUD section, rep-
resents a renewed commitment to the 
upgrading of our aging transportation 
infrastructure, addressing our Nation’s 
affordable housing and homelessness 
crises, bolstering our resiliency to nat-
ural disasters and climate change, rem-
edying inequities and disparities in our 
housing and transportation systems, 
and promoting safety—whether it be 
preventing carbon monoxide poisoning 
in public housing or improving the cer-
tification of complicated aircraft to 
improve aviation safety. 
Overall, the bill includes $84.1 billion 
in discretionary funding. That is an in-
crease of nearly $8.7 billion over the 
fiscal year 2021 enacted level. 
The bill also includes major increases 
in contract authority for formula grant 
programs that draw on the highway 
trust fund rather than discretionary 
funding, and in that respect, of course, 
we are mirroring the INVEST in Amer-
ica Act recently passed by this body. 
On the housing side of the ledger, we 
are preventing the evictions of more 
than 4.8 million households by fully re-
newing all housing choice vouchers and 
meeting the renewal needs of several 
other programs. This is coupled with 
critical new investments, including 
more than 125,000 new tenant-based 
vouchers for low-income families and 
people experiencing or at risk of home-
lessness, and over 4,000 new affordable 
housing units for seniors and people 
with disabilities. 
The bill increases the public housing 
fund by 11 percent to preserve nearly 1 
million units of affordable housing and 
improve the living conditions for more 
than 2 million individuals served by 
our public housing programs. The bill 
also includes significant increases for 
Community 
Development 
Block 
Grants, 
the 
HOME 
Program, 
and 
NeighborWorks to help expand afford-
able housing, spur community revital-
ization, and generate jobs and eco-
nomic activity. 
Our bill, Madam Speaker, does right 
by transportation as well. All modes 
receive robust funding, including high-
ways, transit, rail, aviation, bike and 
pedestrian projects, and ports. This bill 
nearly doubles our investments in pas-
senger and freight rail. It expands port 
infrastructure programs by about one- 
third and emphasizes safety at the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration. The bill 
includes the necessary resources to en-
sure all projects in the Federal Transit 
Administration’s Capital Investment 
Grants pipeline—New Starts and Small 
Starts—can move forward in 2022 and 
provides $1.2 billion for the oversub-
scribed RAISE program. 
Madam Speaker, we are proud of this 
bill, and we urge our colleagues to sup-
port it with confidence. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK), who is the 
ranking member of the Financial Serv-
ices and General Government Sub-
committee. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, my 
thanks to the ranking member for the 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to this package of appropriations bills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4049 
July 27, 2021 
As the ranking member of the Appro-
priations Financial Services and Gen-
eral Government Subcommittee, I have 
great respect for my colleague, Chair-
man MIKE QUIGLEY. We work well to-
gether, and that is saying something 
because he is a Cubs fan, and I am a 
Cardinal fan. 
The bill we are debating today, 
Madam Speaker, is packed with un-
justifiable spending and ignores our 
unsustainable fiscal trajectory. 
In light of unprecedented pandemic 
spending, it was my hope that this fis-
cal year we would prioritize making 
the tough choices necessary to chart a 
responsible fiscal path forward. In-
stead, the Financial Services division 
of the bill proposes a 20 percent in-
crease in discretionary spending over 
fiscal year 2021 and numerous agencies 
funded receive a double-digit percent-
age increase over last year. 
Those numbers are unconscionable, 
Madam Speaker, when you consider the 
fact that this country is well over $28 
trillion in debt. 
I noted with interest the comments 
of the overall chairwoman when she 
talked about the moral test of govern-
ment. Madam Speaker, to me the 
moral test of government is for us to 
do our work and to take care of the ur-
gent needs of our country, but not bur-
den future generations in the course of 
doing so. 
Furthermore, my colleagues on the 
other side continue to call for trillions 
in new government spending, and a new 
GAO report came out just recently 
that says more than $1 trillion of the 
spending that we have commissioned 
through the coronavirus phenomenon 
remains unspent. Not just that, this 
spending has created an inflationary 
spiral that is affecting every taxpayer 
budget in my district. 
There are also several controversial 
policy changes included in the FSGG 
division, such as allowing D.C. tax dol-
lars to fund abortions and removing 
the prohibition on Federal employee 
health benefits funding for abortions. 
These policy changes are no-goes and 
make this bill and minibus, as a whole, 
dead in the water. 
Again, I oppose this package of ap-
propriations, including the Financial 
Services division due to the radical in-
creases in spending and these partisan 
policies. 
But, Madam Speaker, I do look for-
ward to working across the aisle with 
both my counterparts in the House and 
in the Senate to come up with a bill 
and a compromise that will actually 
work for America. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. BISHOP), who is the chair-
man 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on Agriculture, Rural De-
velopment, Food and Drug Administra-
tion, and Related Agencies. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4502. As chair 
of the Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am 
pleased to highlight the national prior-
ities that are funded in our division. 
First, I would like to thank our dis-
tinguished ranking member, Mr. FOR-
TENBERRY, 
and 
the 
entire 
sub-
committee for their continued bipar-
tisan cooperation. 
The jurisdiction of our bill is far- 
reaching and touches the lives of every 
citizen, and while we may disagree on 
matters of policy from time to time, 
agriculture, rural development, the 
safety of our food and drugs, and the 
livability and sustainability of our eco-
systems here and across the globe are 
indeed bipartisan concerns, and we 
truly 
approach 
our 
work 
collabo-
ratively to achieve the greater good for 
our country and humanity. 
However, our FY22 allocation is $26.55 
billion, which is $2.85 billion over the 
fiscal year 2021. 
The bill addresses three key prior-
ities: 
First, it ensures equitable participa-
tion in USDA programs. 
Second, it addresses the impacts of 
climate change. 
Third, it reinvests in staff and leader-
ship offices at USDA. 
The bill provides $4.7 billion for rural 
development 
initiatives, 
including 
more than $900 million for broadband 
expansion to provide economic develop-
ment opportunities and improved edu-
cation and healthcare services in rural 
communities. The bill continues im-
portant funding for the Community Fa-
cilities Program that supports every-
thing from libraries and fire stations to 
childcare centers and nursing homes. 
The bill provides $2.9 billion in farm 
and conservation programs, $3.4 billion 
for agricultural research including a 
significant increase for the 1890 land- 
grant institutions, $1.74 billion for 
Food for Peace grants, and $245 million 
for the McGovern-Dole program, both 
in support of our diplomacy. 
Food insecurity continues to hurt 
millions of Americans. Our bill fully 
funds the SNAP, WIC, and child nutri-
tion programs and helps increase ac-
cess to healthy, nutritious food. 
The Food and Drug Administration is 
funded at $3.47 billion in discretionary 
funding, with increases that help com-
bat the opioid crisis, rare cancers, 
foodborne outbreaks, and heavy metals 
in baby food. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
personal staff, Michael Reed, Tynesha 
Boomer, and Danny Giddings; and the 
subcommittee 
staff, 
Martha 
Foley, 
Diem-Linh Jones, Perry Yates, Joe 
Layman, 
Randy 
Staples, 
Justin 
Masucci, and Echo Domingues for their 
hard work on the bill. 
Also, I would like to thank Tom 
O’Brien from the minority staff. And, 
of course, I thank Chair DELAURO and 
Ranking Member GRANGER
for their 
tremendous leadership. 
b 1545 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I want to give a special shout 
out to Michael Reed, who is retiring as 
my chief of staff and senior policy ad-
visor for appropriations after 18 years 
of extraordinary service. We thank him 
mightily for his service, for his monu-
mental contributions to Georgia’s Sec-
ond District, and we wish him well as 
he enters the next chapter of his life. 
I am proud of this division and the 
entire bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. It is a good bill. It is good 
for America. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the vice ranking 
member of the full Committee on Ap-
propriations, and the ranking member 
of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health 
and Human Services, Education, and 
Related Agencies. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I will be 
brief. But I want to begin by thanking 
Chairwoman DELAURO
and Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER
for 
their 
help 
throughout the process. 
However, 
despite 
many 
areas 
of 
agreement in the bill before us today, 
particularly relating to Labor, Health 
and Human Services, Education, I will 
oppose the bill. 
Madam Speaker, at the end of May, 
President Biden sent us a $6 trillion 
budget request for fiscal year 2022. The 
bill presented today, in many ways, 
mirrors that budget request. Proposing 
the highest spending level since World 
War II, the price tag alone is utterly 
unrealistic. As we continue the see in-
flation on the rise, such a proposal is 
bad for the recovering economy as well. 
Instead of focusing on the urgent pri-
orities for all Americans, like reopen-
ing our economy and schools, President 
Biden’s budget request and this bill, 
elevate controversial left-wing policies 
over-pressing needs, like strengthening 
our national defense and addressing the 
crisis at our southern border. 
In fact, this budget calls for billions 
of dollars to fund progressive priorities 
and policies like the Green New Deal, 
while recommending an effective cut in 
the funding for our military. With 
China and Russia growing their mili-
taries by the day, this is a very mis-
guided approach. 
Finally, most egregious in the Presi-
dent’s budget and the current deal, 
which is reflected here, is the removal 
of the Hyde amendment, which pro-
tects life and prevents Federal tax-
payer-funded abortions. Since it was 
first enacted in 1976, it is estimated 
this provision has saved more than 2 
million lives while protecting the con-
science rights of the great majority of 
Americans who are opposed to pub-
licly-funded abortions. Also, it removes 
the Weldon amendment, which provides 
important conscience protection for 
our healthcare providers who object to 
participating in abortion proceedings. 
This amendment and the Weldon 
amendment have both been supported

July 27, 2021 
for generations by Republicans and 
Democrats alike. 
Madam Speaker, you know that the 
Democrats in Congress do not have the 
majorities capable of passing this bill 
without Republican vote. In the days 
and weeks ahead, it is my hope that 
Members on both sides of the aisle and 
both Chambers can negotiate spending 
that is reasonable and will not lead us 
to financial disaster. 
But the first step toward negotiation 
will be the full reinstatement of the 
Hyde and Weldon amendments along 
with similar pro-life protections con-
tained across the 12 spending bills that 
we consider as a committee. 
These protections need to be rein-
stated for this package to move to the 
President’s desk. Quite frankly, every-
one in the Chamber knows this bill will 
never pass the United States Senate 
without their inclusion, and the major-
ity of American people support that 
view. 
In closing, Madam Speaker, while the 
bill does fund many good things, and 
while I certainly appreciate the open-
ness of the process in which the gentle-
woman from Connecticut and the gen-
tlewoman from Texas have partici-
pated in developing the bill, I do op-
pose it as drafted. 
The price tag is too high. The bill 
contains too many poison pill policy 
riders, and it funds too many unauthor-
ized programs, and bows to a leftist 
agenda that does not reflect the views 
and values of the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I remain hopeful 
that we can do better, and I urge rejec-
tion of the bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
for Appropriations. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chair 
DELAURO for her leadership during this 
process and for yielding. 
The Military Construction, Veterans 
Affairs, and Related Agencies division 
of the bill highlights our continued 
commitment to our servicemembers 
and to their families and to our vet-
erans. 
Constructing the barracks, bases, and 
training facilities that our military 
needs is crucial to our country’s mili-
tary readiness. Properly funding the 
Department of Veterans Affairs is how 
we deliver on the promise of medical 
care and other benefits that our vet-
erans have earned through service to 
our Nation. 
The Related Agencies, including the 
American Battle Monuments Commis-
sion and Arlington National Cemetery, 
demonstrate how we honor the sac-
rifices of those who served. That is why 
I am proud that that bill contains 
$124.5 billion in discretionary funding, 
an $11.4 billion increase above the en-
acted funding level, and $1.3 billion 
above the President’s budget request. 
For Military Construction, we pro-
vide $10.9 billion for critical infrastruc-
ture on military installations, includ-
ing for seven new child development 
centers, and to address issues such as 
mold, vermin, and lead in military 
family housing. 
The bill also invests in climate 
change and energy resilience at our 
military bases and provides $150 mil-
lion for PFAS cleanup at contaminated 
installations. 
For VA, this bill provides $113.1 bil-
lion in discretionary funding, including 
$97.6 billion for medical care that 
makes record investments in women’s 
health along with the ‘‘whole health’’ 
model, mental health and suicide pre-
vention, homelessness assistance, rural 
health, and opioid abuse prevention. 
The bill significantly boosts funding 
for VA research to support work study-
ing areas like toxic exposures and trau-
matic brain injury, and infrastructure 
improvements to ensure modern, safe 
facilities to treat our veterans, as well 
as continued implementation of Elec-
tronic Health Record Modernization 
and efforts to reduce the disability 
claims backlog. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Ranking Member Judge CARTER 
and Ranking Member GRANGER, I am 
proud to have you as my partners and 
friends. I would like to thank the staff 
of both subcommittees and our per-
sonal offices. 
This is a good bill and does right by 
our servicemembers, their families, 
and our veterans. It also benefits Flo-
ridians and advances our Democratic 
priorities. 
The Labor-Health bill includes $6 
million, an increase of $1 million for 
the EARLY Act legislation that I au-
thored that educates young and at-risk 
women about breast cancer. It also in-
cludes language to implement my 
PALS Act to extend breast cancer 
screening for women 40 to 49 without 
co-pay until January 2025. 
The Agriculture bill includes impor-
tant report language and funding for 
response to citrus greening disease, as 
well 
as 
language 
and 
funding 
to 
strengthen the regulation of e-ciga-
rettes. 
The Energy and Water bill includes a 
record increase for climate-conscious 
clean energy programs, and a record 
$350 million for Everglades restoration. 
This is $100 million over the enacted 
level, but I know we can do more. 
The Financial Services bill also in-
cludes $2 million, an increase of $700,000 
for the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool 
and Spa Safety Act program, which I 
authored 
to 
prevent 
childhood 
drownings. 
Additionally, the Interior-Environ-
ment bill includes language that orders 
a full environmental review on oil 
drilling applications in Big Cypress Na-
tional Preserve, and further blocks off-
shore oil or gas drilling in new coastal 
areas. 
The Transportation-Housing bill in-
cludes $300 million for the Port Infra-
structure Development Program, a $70 
million increase, which will help Flor-
ida’s ports recover from COVID–19. 
And, finally, this package includes 
many 
of 
my 
community 
funding 
projects. I am proud to support this 
package. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CARTER), the ranking mem-
ber of the Subcommittee on Military 
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Re-
lated Agencies. 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I really wish I was here ex-
pressing my support for the fiscal year 
2022 Military Construction, Veterans 
Affairs, and Related Agencies bill, be-
cause it includes funding for many im-
portant construction projects and pro-
grams for veterans. But, unfortunately, 
I cannot support the bill for three rea-
sons. 
The 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
is to provide adequate resources for our 
servicemembers, ensure that we fulfill 
the promises America made to our vet-
erans, and be good stewards of tax dol-
lars. 
While this bill includes funding for 
many priorities, including child devel-
opment centers, barracks, suicide pre-
vention 
programs, 
and 
electronic 
health records, it is not part of a bipar-
tisan funding framework that appro-
priately allocates funding between de-
fense and nondefense programs. 
The bill also drops two restrictions 
on funding that have protected Ameri-
cans from the transfer of detainees, 
terrorists, to the United States for 
more than 10 years. There is no reason 
to allow these terrorists on U.S. soil. 
They need to remain in Guantanamo 
Bay and pay for their heinous crimes. 
Finally, I oppose the majority par-
ty’s attempt to force hardworking citi-
zens to pay to end unborn human life. 
The Hyde amendment protects every 
American from seeing their tax dollars 
used to fund something that is the 
exact opposite of the American value 
of life, liberty, and pursuit of happi-
ness. 
It is simple. Congress must maintain 
the Hyde amendment. 
Despite my concerns, I think we can 
resolve our differences, address these 
issues, and provide responsible levels of 
funding for the next fiscal year. 
In closing, I want to thank Chair-
woman WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ
for her 
work on this bill and stewardship of 
the Subcommittee on Military Con-
struction, Veterans Affairs, and Re-
lated Agencies. Along with the staff, 
she has personally worked to address 
many requests from all Members in 
this bill. 
Also, 
I 
thank 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER
and Chairwoman DELAURO 
for their support. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the majority 
leader of the House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4051 
July 27, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, as ev-
erybody knows, I had the delightful op-
portunity of serving on the Appropria-
tions Committee as an active member 
for 23 years. I am on leave, and I may 
be on leave forever, who knows, but I 
care a lot about these bills. These are 
the only bills that have to pass. They 
are the only bills that if they don’t 
pass, the government shuts down. 
They are the bills that used to bring 
us together. It is relatively easy to 
compromise on figures, but it is dif-
ficult to compromise on other issues. 
Although, I will say, as I begin my re-
marks—and I am not going to be that 
long, but as I begin my remarks, I 
voted for, in the 1980s and 1990s and 
over the last 20 years, for appropria-
tions bills in which there were con-
tained issues that I severely disagreed 
with, and I know Ms. DELAURO has as 
well. 
But I know that overall we had to 
pass the bills, and that I thought then, 
and I think now, that the bills were 
largely dealing with what the Amer-
ican people wanted us to deal with. 
So I rise today, Madam Speaker, in 
support of these bills, the seven in this 
package, and hopefully, three to come, 
and the two thereafter, whenever we 
bring them to the floor. 
Last Congress, after Democrats took 
control of the House majority, we 
passed legislation to fund nearly all of 
government before the end of the sum-
mer. I was very proud of that. We 
passed it in June of 2019, and we passed 
it in July of 2020. We have done that 2 
years in a row now. What we haven’t 
accomplished, however, is the passage 
of these bills prior to September 30. 
That is what we should be doing. 
I know the chair feels that way, and 
I think the ranking member feels that 
way. I haven’t talked to her specifi-
cally about that, but I think she does. 
Moving the appropriations process 
along on time made it easier to fore-
stall shutdowns and fund the govern-
ment for the American people. 
Now we are doing so again and with 
a Democratic-controlled Senate and 
White House, we are passing bills of 
which every Member of this body can 
be proud. And I predict that every 
Member of this body will go home and 
claim credit for something in these ap-
propriations bills, whether you voted 
for or against. 
The appropriations bills we are bring-
ing to the floor in this minibus pack-
age deliver for all of our constituents. 
They invest in economic growth; they 
expand infrastructure; they care for 
our veterans; they make college more 
affordable; advance research into com-
batting the next pandemic and curing 
rare diseases; protect America’s public 
lands and keeping our air and water 
clean. 
b 1600 
They help farmers, small business, 
and large business. They help farmers 
and invest in rural communities, and 
combat hunger and provide housing, 
among other things. 
These investments in the American 
people will help us build back better 
from the pandemic and enable our busi-
nesses, workers, students, and farmers 
to get ahead in the global economy. 
One of the provisions I want to high-
light in particular, of which I am very 
proud, is the major increase in funding 
for full-service community schools. I 
have been proud to advocate for this 
program since we first launched it in 
2008. 
Full-service community schools help 
the youngest Americans and their fam-
ilies—that is the key, ‘‘and their fami-
lies,’’ the whole family. Critical serv-
ices are accessible all in one place, not 
only early childhood education but also 
nutrition assistance, dental exams, fi-
nancial literacy courses, and more. 
When children and their families 
have easy access to these resources, it 
means greater success for students 
throughout their later years in school, 
better preparing them for college and 
careers 
and 
helping 
us 
close 
the 
achievement gap. 
In my State of Maryland, we have 
had tremendous success with our net-
work of Judy Centers. Judy Centers are 
named after Judith P. Hoyer, my wife, 
and in her memory. She was an early 
childhood educator in Prince George’s 
County and a pioneer in the develop-
ment of this type of program. 
Like full-service community schools, 
Judy Centers are proving their worth 
by narrowing achievement gaps and 
preparing more and more students for 
success 
in 
kindergarten 
and 
later 
grades. 
The minibus on the floor today would 
invest $443 million for this critical ini-
tiative. Now, that is not a lot per child, 
but it is a lot of effect per child, which 
will help States launch and expand 
their full-service community school 
programs and serve many more chil-
dren and their families. 
I thank Chairwoman DELAURO, not 
only for her strong support and her 
leadership in making sure that funding 
was included, but also for her leader-
ship of this committee. She has been a 
very faithful steward, and a steward 
who has acted in a very transparent, 
inclusive way so that every Member 
knew what they could have and honor 
their initiatives and their priorities. 
All the members and staff of the Ap-
propriations Committee for their hard 
work should be thanked as well by all 
of us. These are tough bills to put to-
gether, tough bills to move forward. I 
thank them for their efforts together 
to ensure that the House is doing its 
job for the people. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this package of appropria-
tions bills. 
Now, some may say, ‘‘Well, the Sen-
ate hasn’t acted,’’ and that is a lamen-
table fact. The Senate has not passed a 
single appropriations bill out of com-
mittee, nor had they passed a single 
bill out of committee by the end of the 
fiscal year last year. 
I would hope that our colleagues in 
the United States Senate would not 
keep treating the appropriations proc-
ess as a backwater because where we 
put our money is where our heart is, 
where our priorities are. This bill, 
these bills—this bill, but these bills, all 
10 of the ones that we are going to con-
sider hopefully this week—show where 
our priorities are. 
I hope that the Senate will begin its 
own appropriations process so that we 
can complete our work together, per-
haps not before the end of the fiscal 
year but certainly before the end of the 
year, so we do not have some either CR 
or omnibus, which is the product of 
just a few as opposed to the many in 
this House and in the Senate. 
I urge support of this minibus. I urge 
support of the three bills to come, the 
State-Foreign 
Operations 
bill, 
the 
Commerce-Justice bill, and the Legis-
lative Branch bill. I thank all the car-
dinals and the ranking members for 
their help and their work. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART), the ranking 
member of the Transportation and 
Housing and Urban Development, and 
Related Agencies Subcommittee. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 4502. 
I would first like to thank Chair-
woman DELAURO and Ranking Member 
GRANGER. While we have, obviously, 
disagreements at this stage of the 
game, that cannot stop us from work-
ing on behalf of the American people. 
I also particularly want to thank 
Chairman PRICE for his friendship, for 
his openness and transparency, and for 
his integrity. He is committed to 
transparency, which is something that 
we should all expect from the agencies 
that we fund. 
This bill includes funding and lan-
guage requests from Members on both 
sides of the aisle. That was not a small 
task, but it keeps the best ideas com-
ing forward to improve the way that, 
again, our government functions, and 
that is important. 
I am pleased that the bill continues 
investments in our Nation’s highways, 
rails, transit, and airport infrastruc-
ture, as well as we continue to make 
progress improving port infrastructure, 
which, obviously, is key for our supply 
chains. 
The chairman once again also has 
made DOT safety programs a priority. 
Our roads, railways, and skies are safer 
due to our shared priority on safety. 
Chairman PRICE’s commitment to ad-
dressing homelessness and housing for 
the elderly and the disabled is evident 
in this bill. We share the goal of pro-
moting affordable housing and pro-
viding a safety net to our most valu-
able citizens. 
Now, again, while I support and ap-
plaud many of the decisions made in 
this bill, a $9 billion top-line increase, 
a 13 percent increase over last year, is 
just something that I cannot support. 
Let me give you an example. I am 
concerned about the dramatic expan-
sion of HUD assistance programs in

this bill—well-meaning, but, in part, 
the problem is that those increases 
would need to be sustained in future 
years. This would crowd out our ability 
to make targeted, responsible transpor-
tation and housing investments in fu-
ture years. 
Our national debt exceeds $28 tril-
lion, and it is only going to continue to 
grow under the majority’s approach to 
spending, not to mention the fact that 
it seems that this approach is creating 
a huge, huge increase in inflation. It is 
an inflation factory that we see. 
It is also clear that Members on my 
side of the aisle have made it clear that 
we cannot support bills that give ex-
cess increases to nondefense agencies, 
especially while reducing or short-
changing our national defense. 
We all know that, to move forward, 
we need a bipartisan agreement on 
spending, and the time for that agree-
ment is now so that we can make re-
sponsible investments that create jobs 
and expand opportunity without the 
dramatic increases that we are seeing 
in this Nation caused by the spending 
of the majority. 
Again, at this stage, I cannot support 
the bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Maine (Ms. PINGREE), the chair of 
the Subcommittee on Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies of the 
Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding the 
time. I thank her and Ranking Member 
GRANGER for their leadership on this 
committee. 
I rise to support the fiscal year 2022 
Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies appropriations bill. 
I also want to thank Ranking Mem-
ber JOYCE
for his collaboration and 
partnership through this process. It is 
truly a privilege and a pleasure to 
work with him. 
I want to thank the hardworking 
committee staff, Rita Culp, who is our 
clerk; Jocelyn Hunn; Janet Erickson; 
Kusai Merchant; Tyler Coe; Marcel 
Caldwell; and also my personal staff, 
Evan Johnston, Lisa Pahel, and Katie 
Bergh. We couldn’t do it without all of 
their hard work. 
For 
fiscal 
year 
2022, 
the 
sub-
committee is recommending a total of 
$43.4 billion for the Interior, Environ-
ment, and Related Agencies bill. This 
is an increase of $7.3 billion over last 
year’s enacted level, which is a 20 per-
cent increase. I am proud this bill 
makes long-overdue investments to 
care for our planet, to fight climate 
emergency, and to meet our trust obli-
gations to Tribal nations. 
The bill prioritizes the protection 
and preservation of our landscapes and 
biodiversity, providing $15.6 billion for 
the Department of the Interior. 
It supports the administration’s ini-
tiatives on climate change, such as the 
Civilian Climate Corps, and affirms the 
role of science as the foundation for de-
cisionmaking. It funds a national ini-
tiative to reclaim abandoned mines 
and cap orphan oil and gas wells, and it 
makes investments in renewable en-
ergy development, including offshore 
wind. 
Climate change is causing more ex-
treme weather events and drought con-
ditions, as well as worsening existing 
problems such as the spread of invasive 
species. These factors are all contrib-
uting to the increasing threat of high- 
intensity wildfires in the West. 
The Interior bill not only provides 
$5.7 billion for wildland fire manage-
ment but it also invests in programs to 
improve the health of our forests and 
make them more resilient. 
The bill also includes major invest-
ments to clean up pollution and pro-
tect human health and the environ-
ment. The bill provides $11.4 billion for 
the Environmental Protection Agency, 
the highest level in the Agency’s his-
tory. 
Across the country, Superfund clean-
ups are delayed because of the lack of 
funding. This bill boosts Superfund 
spending by 27 percent and will accel-
erate the pace of cleanup of toxic 
chemicals from the country’s most 
contaminated sites. 
The bill adopts a whole-of-govern-
ment approach to address environ-
mental justice and invests an unprece-
dented $248 million in these efforts. 
Additionally, the bill provides $4 bil-
lion for grant programs to make drink-
ing water and sewer system improve-
ments, remove lead from our taps, im-
prove air quality, and strengthen our 
Nation’s recycling infrastructure. 
These grants have profound impacts 
on public health and the environment, 
but they are also economic drivers that 
create good-paying American jobs. 
Following our work in the CARES 
and the American Recovery Plan Acts, 
this bill supports the arts and human-
ities by providing $201 million for both 
the National Endowment for the Arts 
and the National Endowment for the 
Humanities. The cultural sector has 
been 
particularly 
devastated 
by 
COVID–19, and this funding will help to 
support relief and recovery for commu-
nity organizations across the country. 
Finally, this bill supports Native 
American families by investing in a 
strong and resilient Indian Country, in-
cluding 
through 
education 
and 
healthcare programs. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. PINGREE. Within the Depart-
ment of the Interior, the bill invests $4 
billion in Indian Affairs programs, in-
cluding an additional $180 million to 
address climate change impacts. For 
Indian Health Services, the bill pro-
vides an additional $1.9 billion toward 
meeting Federal treaty and trust obli-
gations for healthcare. 
The investments in this bill would 
improve the lives of Americans, and I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska 
(Mr. 
FORTENBERRY), 
the 
ranking member of the Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, first, let me acknowledge the lead-
ership of our committee, the chair, 
ROSA DELAURO, and our Ranking Mem-
ber KAY GRANGER particularly, in this 
sense, for their attempt to navigate 
this contentious process in which there 
really are areas of mutuality but are, 
unfortunately, marked also by irrecon-
cilable differences. 
With that said, the agriculture com-
ponent of this bill does reflect the co-
operative spirit of both the American 
agricultural community as well as this 
subcommittee. 
Agriculture has the unique ability to 
unite across political, social, and eco-
nomic divides, and I am particularly 
grateful to Chairman BISHOP and his 
staff for producing a reasonable base 
bill here that we all hope can be refined 
as it moves through the process. 
Madam Speaker, production agri-
culture is a mainstay of America’s 
economy. The vastness of our land, our 
ingenuity, and our technological prow-
ess allow our Nation to provide the 
most abundant, low-cost, nutritious, 
and diverse array of foods found any-
where. Our trade imbalance would be 
so much greater were it not for this re-
markable success. 
We are also empowered to meet our 
country’s charitable impulse by mov-
ing approximately $2 billion in aid to 
persons overseas facing food insecurity. 
Investments in this bill build upon this 
amazing productivity. 
Here are some important highlights. 
There is: 
Support for what I call the Farm of 
the Future to enhance efficiency, re-
generative capacity, and new forms of 
small-scale 
niche 
agriculture 
that 
marry high-tech with high-touch and, 
again, connect the farm to the family; 
Support for the Farm to School pro-
gram, bringing healthy, nutritious food 
choices to children; 
Strengthened partnerships between 
minority-serving institutions within 
our land-grant system; 
Increased 
support 
for 
rural 
broadband and what I call the eco-
system of livability; 
More resources for unannounced drug 
plant inspections in China and India as 
well as a commitment to environ-
mental security through investments 
in better cover crop practices and con-
trol of fertilizer runoff. 
b 1615 
Now, here are the needed fixes. Rank-
ing Member GRANGER has been right 
and clear in her remarks that the pro-
posed nondefense increases across these 
bills are way too high, 10 percent in 
this bill alone. 
The bill also contains an unauthor-
ized nutrition program that grants un-
limited funding in the final quarter.

That is for the authorizing committee 
to take up. 
The bill also has a provision that 
makes unnecessary changes to a meat 
and poultry processing program that 
Secretary Vilsack originally proposed 
in the Obama administration. 
I believe that we can fix these mat-
ters and, hopefully, move toward an 
agreement as this bill moves through 
the process. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY), the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Financial Serv-
ices and General Government. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, first, 
I want to thank staff on both sides for 
putting this together. On the majority 
side: Laura, Marybeth, Elliot, Aalok, 
Parker, and Matt. On the minority 
side, John Martens; and from my own 
staff, Charlie and Max. 
I do want to thank Mr. WOMACK, the 
ranking member, who is a friend, a 
gentleman, and very easy to work with 
at a complicated time and his apparent 
insistence on being a Cardinals fan, as 
he just raised. He doesn’t seem to mind 
when I bring up the St. Louis profes-
sional football and basketball teams, 
but we will leave that to another day. 
As to the bill, the bill recommends 
$29 billion. This is an increase of $4.8 
billion over the comparable year of 
2021. 
It includes $13.6 billion for the IRS, 
an increase of $1.7 billion above fiscal 
2021, a first step toward restoring the 
cuts this agency has suffered. The in-
crease will improve enforcement ac-
tivities and support better customer 
service. 
Notably, the bill includes $330 million 
for Community Development Financial 
Institutions, which is $60 million above 
the fiscal year 2021 level to provide 
critical resources to underserved com-
munities. 
The bill provides $324 million for the 
Small Business Administration’s En-
trepreneurial Development Programs, 
which is $52 million above fiscal year 
2021. 
It also includes significant funding 
for the General Services Administra-
tion, including $300 million for a new 
Electric Vehicles Fund, $100 million for 
the GSA to manage climate change 
risks, and over $1 billion to modernize 
and improve the GSA real property 
portfolio by reducing their climate im-
pact and improving resiliency. 
The bill also includes $300 million for 
the High Intensity Drug Trafficking 
Areas Program, an increase of $10 mil-
lion, and the Drug-Free Communities 
Program is funded at $110 million. 
In the lead-up to our country’s 250th 
anniversary, the bill includes much- 
needed funding for the modernization 
of the National Archives building, 
which houses the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, the Constitution, and the 
Bill of Rights. 
The bill includes $8.15 billion in dis-
cretionary appropriations for the judi-
cial branch, an increase to fund protec-
tive services and physical security 
needed in courthouses and ensure the 
continued operations of the judiciary. 
The bill also increases funding for 
agencies to protect everyday con-
sumers and retail investors, including 
the Consumer Product Safety Commis-
sion, the Federal Trade Commission, 
and the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission. 
I am proud this bill removes several 
longstanding policy riders, including 
many that dictate to the District of 
Columbia how to manage its own af-
fairs or spend its own money or that 
harm and limit transparency in polit-
ical spending. 
Finally, I would like to take a mo-
ment to highlight an issue that is a 
priority of mine, election security. 
This bill today includes $500 million 
for payments to States to help them 
meet the challenge of ensuring the real 
security and integrity of American 
elections. This represents our contin-
ued commitment to long-term funding 
for election security. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE), the ranking member 
of the Interior and Environment Sub-
committee. 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4502. 
Before I get into the details of divi-
sion E, the Interior and Environment 
section of the bill, I want to thank 
Chairwoman DELAURO
and Ranking 
Member GRANGER for their leadership 
on the Appropriations Committee. 
I would also like to extend my sin-
cere thanks to CHELLIE PINGREE, the 
chair of the Interior, Environment, and 
Related Agencies Subcommittee. 
Chair PINGREE has been an excellent 
leader, and I am glad I have had the op-
portunity to serve alongside her as 
ranking member on the subcommittee. 
The fiscal year 2022 Interior and En-
vironment bill includes many bipar-
tisan initiatives to conserve and pro-
tect our Nation’s natural and cultural 
resources and to increase the Federal 
commitment to honor our treaties and 
trust responsibilities with American 
Indians and Alaska Natives. 
I am grateful for my home district in 
Ohio, and the States in the Great 
Lakes Basin, that the bill provides in-
creased funding for the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative. This funding is 
critical to our work to restore and pro-
tect the lakes for future generations. 
Robust funding for the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative is essential as 
we continue our efforts with Federal, 
State, Tribal, local, and nonprofit part-
ners to delist Areas of Concern, address 
shoreline erosion, improve water qual-
ity, prevent harmful algal blooms, and 
control invasive species. 
I am also especially pleased that the 
bill makes critical investments in In-
dian Country, a longstanding bipar-
tisan priority of this subcommittee. 
The $12.1 billion across the bill will 
help support healthcare, education, law 
enforcement, and other operational 
programs throughout Indian Country. 
Chair PINGREE
and her staff have 
worked hard to accommodate requests 
from Members on both sides of the 
aisle in this bill that will be appre-
ciated by our constituents, regardless 
of party. 
Unfortunately, while I am supportive 
of the bipartisan components of the 
bill, I am unable to support the bill in 
its current form. 
First and foremost, the bill adds sev-
eral new controversial policy riders 
that would curtail U.S. energy inde-
pendence by limiting conventional en-
ergy and natural resource develop-
ment. 
Limiting our domestic supplies of 
much-needed natural resources does 
not decrease our demand for them; it 
only makes us more dependent upon 
foreign nations to obtain them, which 
is not only a national security concern 
but also an economic security, environ-
mental, and human rights concern. 
Our economy continues to depend 
upon on an all-of-the-above energy 
strategy, and these added provisions 
would undermine our ability to meet 
that demand. 
Similar riders were dropped from the 
final conference agreement last year, 
and the same must be done again be-
fore the bill can be signed into law. 
The Interior bill also eliminates or 
weakens several longstanding provi-
sions that were once again enacted on 
a bipartisan basis last year. Adding 
these provisions back will be essential 
to reaching a bipartisan agreement. 
The bill before us today proposes a $7 
billion increase in discretionary spend-
ing, with many agencies receiving dou-
ble-digit percent increases. 
As a result of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Congress has provided trillions 
of dollars in economic stimulus and re-
lief to help Americans tackle unique 
challenges. 
On the heels of this unprecedented 
spending, as we continue to restore our 
way of life and reignite our economy, it 
is imperative that the Federal Govern-
ment makes the tough choices nec-
essary to live within its means. 
So it is for a combination of these 
funding and policy reasons that I can-
not support this bill at this time and in 
its current form. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this pack-
age. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE), who is a member 
of the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding the 
time and the chair for her leadership as 
well. I am honored to be a new member 
of the Appropriations Committee, but I 
must oppose this appropriations bill. 
I was disappointed by the party-line 
votes many of my colleagues took dur-
ing committee markup against amend-
ments that should have garnered bipar-
tisan support.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4054 
July 27, 2021 
I am most disheartened that the ma-
jority failed to keep decades-long, bi-
partisan provisions in this bill. Chief 
among those were the Hyde and the 
Weldon amendments. 
Since Hyde was first included in 1976, 
it has saved nearly 2.5 million lives. 
Nearly 60 percent of Americans agree 
that taxpayer dollars should not be 
used to pay for abortions. 
The Weldon amendment ensures that 
healthcare providers cannot be forced 
to provide abortion services, a protec-
tion that has been in place since 2005. 
We should never force our healthcare 
workers to participate in abortion 
when they have taken an oath to heal 
and to do no harm. 
While there was much in this bill I 
would like to support, the inclusion of 
these provisions is non-negotiable. 
I will always stand to preserve the 
sanctity of life and to protect our 
healthcare providers from being forced 
to perform actions they find uncon-
scionable. 
The government has a duty to pro-
tect the inalienable right to life. 
Therefore, I cannot support this bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), the dean of the 
House of Representatives. 
Mr. 
YOUNG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Ms. GRANGER for yielding, and I 
thank Ms. DELAURO for the work you 
have done, but I cannot support this 
bill. 
Before giving my short testimony, I 
would like to quickly congratulate 
Lydia Jacoby from Seward, Alaska, on 
winning an Olympic gold medal on the 
100-meter swim. She is 17 years old. 
That is something to smile about. 
I want to thank, very frankly, the 
majority side. Thank you for getting 
me elected every time, which you do. 
Because every time we have an appro-
priations process, you add a provision 
in there preventing access to building 
roads in the Tongass National Forest. 
As long as you keep doing that, I am 
going to get reelected, so I thank you 
for that. 
In the over 60 years I have lived in 
Alaska, I have watched tens of thou-
sands of jobs in the logging industry 
and support industries shrivel up and 
not be there anymore. These are work-
ing American jobs. 
The economy in southeast Alaska is 
hurting, and it is not because of a poor 
timber market; it is because of, very 
frankly, radical environmentalism. 
The timber industry supports great- 
paying, year-round jobs in southeast 
Alaska. Even though the environ-
mentalists have already succeeded in 
locking up over 96 percent of the 
Tongass forest, eliminating most of 
these jobs, they are now after the re-
maining 4 percent of that land mass. 
Where this idea came from, other than 
extreme 
environmentalists, 
I 
don’t 
know. 
This is nothing less than economic 
terrorism, hurting a community in 
Alaska, which I represent. It is not just 
about timber. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Alaska. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, it is 
about communications. I can’t even 
build a road from one community to 
another community. No place else in 
America can that happen. 
So I am asking you to continue what 
you are doing, which you are hurting 
my State, but you are getting me re-
elected, so thank you very much. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing. 
Madam Speaker, the bills we are con-
sidering today have some fatal flaws I 
simply cannot support. Again, there is 
no agreement on top-line spending lev-
els, and the bills include some of the 
most concerning policy changes I have 
ever seen in an appropriations bill. 
The package before us includes exces-
sive spending, jeopardizes our security, 
reverses the provisions that protect 
life, and adds burdensome regulations. 
Moving this package is simply a wasted 
opportunity. 
This is a partisan measure. I strongly 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, our country faces 
dire needs. Far too many people are 
struggling to put food on the table, to 
pay their rent. Many more struggle to 
afford childcare or the cost of edu-
cation and skills training. The deck 
has been stacked for so long for the 
wealthy and the well connected, while 
our infrastructure crumbles and the ex-
istential threat of climate change 
looms. From the mountains of Appa-
lachia to the struggling neighborhoods 
of our largest cities, the biggest deficit 
we face is one of hope. 
The moral test of our government 
today is how we meet these challenges. 
It is whether we can rise to the occa-
sion and deliver hope for the American 
people who have been left behind for 
far too long. 
The bills before us meet that moral 
test. Their transformative investments 
create jobs, grow opportunity, and pro-
vide a lifeline to the vulnerable. They 
invest in our infrastructure and in a 
cleaner, safer future. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to voice my support for H.R 4502, a bill 
which provides funding for numerous critical 
federal programs for Fiscal Year 2022. 
I want to thank our Chairwoman, ROSA 
DELAURO for leading the appropriations proc-
ess this year and ensuring that our committee 
marked up all twelve appropriations bills. I 
also thank the Speaker, Leader HOYER, and 
Whip CLYBURN for working to get this bill to 
the floor. 
Lastly, I want to thank Chairs BISHOP, KAP-
TUR, 
PINGREE, 
PRICE, 
QUIGLEY, 
and 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for their leadership in 
crafting each of these individual bills included 
in this package. 
This bill makes critical investments to fight 
poverty, hunger homelessness, and housing 
insecurity. It funds reproductive health, edu-
cation and labor programs that create opportu-
nities for our youth. As the Co-Chair of the 
Pro-Choice Caucus, I am proud that this bill 
removes the Hyde and Weldon amendments. 
These provisions have long had a terrible and 
disproportionate impact on low-income women 
and women of color. Getting them off the 
books will be a huge step forward for repro-
ductive and racial justice. 
I represent a district in the Bay Area that 
has some of the biggest challenges with trans-
portation and housing affordability in the coun-
try. This bill will help 125 thousand new fami-
lies get and keep a roof over their heads. And 
it includes six hundred million for Housing Op-
portunities for People with AIDS, to help peo-
ple struggling with the converging pandemics 
of HIV and poverty to combat both in tandem. 
This bill comes at a time when we can no 
longer ignore that systemic racism is at the 
heart of every crisis we face today—from the 
COVID–19 pandemic disproportionately im-
pacting communities of color, to the crisis of 
police brutality. 
Crucially, this bill includes my request to re-
quire HHS to develop a comprehensive plan 
to develop a National Center on Antiracism 
and Health Equity. This new Center will be a 
cross-cutting effort that would address the 
shortage of behavioral health professionals 
and Black men in medicine, barriers for people 
living with HIV, the need for increased re-
search for diseases such as Sickle Cell and 
COPD, and empowering trusted messengers 
of our communities. 
This bill also funds a pilot program under 
the Office of Minority Health to oversee grants 
to support community-based organizations 
working to address structural racism in public 
health. I would like to thank Congresswoman 
PRESSLEY and Senator WARREN for partnering 
with me in this effort. 
I am happy to see increased funding for life-
saving programs such as the Ryan White Pro-
gram and the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative. As 
the Co-Chair of the Congressional HIV/AIDS 
Caucus, I will look forward to continuing to 
work with all of you to end the HIV epidemic 
by 2030. 
Finally, as the Co-Chair of the Congres-
sional Cannabis Caucus, I was glad to see 
cannabis research as a priority through var-
ious agencies. Gaining scientific data on can-
nabis will be valuable in further understanding 
its potential benefits. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4502. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
the bill under consideration removes several 
longstanding pro-life protections and advances 
provisions that would force U.S. taxpayers to 
pay for abortion-on-demand. 
It removes the Hyde Amendment which pro-
tects federal taxpayers from being forced to 
fund elective abortions—an agreement that 
has received bipartisan support since 1976. It 
also removes the Weldon Amendment which 
prevents discrimination against health care 
providers who do not want to participate in 
abortion. 
Similarly, the rule under consideration pre-
cludes even a vote on the Cole amendment,

which would restore the Hyde Amendment 
and the Weldon Amendment. 
The rule also denies a vote to my amend-
ment, which would restore a law I authored in 
1983—38 years ago—prohibiting funding of 
abortion under the Federal Employees Health 
Benefits Program. Like the Hyde Amendment, 
that law must be renewed every year. 
A total of 14 pro-life amendments were 
ruled out of order by the Democratic majority. 
All is not lost, however. I remain hopeful— 
confident—that the Senate will reinstate all 
current pro-life protections, like the Hyde 
Amendment. 
Taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize 
abortion nor should anyone or any entity be 
coerced against their conscience to perform or 
facilitate the killing of an unborn child. 
The Hyde Amendment has saved more than 
2.4 million lives—about 60,000 per year since 
it was first enacted. 
If retained in law, more innocent lives will be 
protected. 
It is time, I believe, for more of us to face 
the harsh reality of what abortion actually does 
to children and look beyond the sound bites 
and slogans. 
No one in the media ever bothers to expose 
the violent methods of abortion that include 
dismemberment of a child’s fragile body, in-
cluding decapitation, and that one of the drugs 
in RU–486 starves the baby to death. 
Or that unborn babies killed by abortion at 
20 weeks or later experience excruciating suf-
fering and physical pain. And until rendered 
unconscious or dead by these hideous proce-
dures, the child feels the pain of every cut ac-
cording to medical experts in life-enhancing 
prenatal surgery. 
Abortion is not health care unless one con-
strues the precious life of an unborn child to 
be analogous to a tumor to be excised or a 
disease to be vanqulshed—pregnancy is not a 
disease. 
Mr. Biden once wrote constituents, explain-
ing his support for laws against funding for 
abortion, by saying ‘‘it would protect both the 
woman and her unborn child.’’ 
Mr. Biden went on to say ‘‘those of us who 
are opposed to abortion should not be com-
pelled to pay for them.’’ I agree. Most Ameri-
cans agree. 
Over the years, the polls have consistently 
shown that Americans do not support taxpayer 
funded abortion. 
The January 2021 Marist poll found that by 
a margin of 58 percent to 38 percent Ameri-
cans oppose taxpayer funded abortion. 
The Marist poll found that a supermajority of 
65 percent of Independents oppose taxpayer 
funding of abortion. 
Unborn babies need the President of the 
United States and Members of Congress to be 
their friend and advocate, not powerful adver-
saries.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. WOMACK) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. HERN), my friend from 
Tulsa. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, last year 
we lost Senator Tom Coburn, a dear 
friend of mine, and a legend in both 
this Chamber and across the Capitol 
for his consistency and dedication to 
the fiscal responsibility of our country. 
Tom taught me so much about the 
way our government works, about our 
broken budget process, and about the 
importance of spending American tax 
dollars wisely. 
It is pretty clear that a lot of my col-
leagues have forgotten one monu-
mental fact: that the Federal Govern-
ment has no money of our own. Every 
dollar comes from the American peo-
ple. 
When we are in this Chamber debat-
ing spending another billion here and a 
trillion there, it doesn’t come from 
some bottomless bank account. It 
comes from the hardworking American 
people, and we can never take that for 
granted. 
I have with me today Senator Tom 
Coburn’s black book, an outline of his 
deficit reduction plan in 2011 to get the 
United States on track to eliminate 
our debt and balance the budget. 
My colleague from Oklahoma, Sen-
ator LANKFORD, has taken on Tom’s 
mantle as the fiscal hawk of the Senate 
and now produces a similar report de-
tailing the many, many line items of 
waste and abuse in the Federal Govern-
ment. 
In his memory, I helmed the Repub-
lican Study Committee Budget and 
Spending Task Force this Congress, 
and we produced what is still the only 
budget introduced to the House. My 
budget is not only a clear path back to 
black, as my friend Tom would say, it 
balances in just 5 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4056 
July 27, 2021 
Our interest costs on the debt alone 
are expected to nearly triple in the 
next 10 years, making interest costs 
the third largest Federal expense be-
hind Social Security and Medicare. 
As our spending continues to rise, so, 
too, do the concerns of our constitu-
ents. 
Our esteemed majority leader just 
criticized the Senate on their lack of 
passing appropriations bills. Speaker 
PELOSI has often said, ‘‘Show me your 
budget, and I will show you your val-
ues.’’ 
It is alarming to me the Speaker 
abandoning her responsibilities out-
lined in the Congressional Budget Act 
for the third year in a row. 
This majority and their leadership do 
not care about American taxpayers, 
and they don’t care about the fiscal 
health of this country. 
When I came to Congress at the end 
of 2018, our national debt was $19 tril-
lion. In just 21⁄2 years, we are quickly 
approaching $30 trillion. Our debt has 
grown some 58 percent. Meanwhile, our 
economic growth has been somewhere 
around 2 percent. 
In the past 12 months, our country 
has been devastated by COVID–19, both 
physically, mentally, and financially. 
With millions of Americans losing 
their jobs, businesses, or both, they 
turned to the Federal Government for 
help. 
Since last year, Congress has spent 
$13.3 trillion of American taxpayers’ 
money on government COVID relief 
programs. To date only $8.7 trillion of 
those funds have been spent, leaving us 
with $4.6 trillion of the American peo-
ple’s money in government bonds. 
PELOSI and Biden are spending money 
as fast as they can without any over-
sight into the effectiveness of what has 
already been appropriated. 
From day one of the Biden adminis-
tration, President Biden and Vice 
President HARRIS have shown nothing 
but contempt for the American tax-
payer, choosing to increase spending, 
increase taxes, and destroy jobs across 
the country. All they have to show for 
it is rampant inflation and continued 
unemployment. 
What we are looking at today is a 
drastic expansion of Federal spending 
across the board. My colleagues across 
the aisle are throwing money at every 
Federal department and agency except 
for the defense of our people, of course. 
Flagrant overspending is on the 
menu today. The Department of En-
ergy will be increased by 7.6 percent; 
the Department of Interior’s budget is 
expected to expand by some 19 percent; 
the Department of Labor by 17.6 per-
cent, with $4.2 billion to bolster Biden’s 
unemployment programs, preventing 
people from returning to work. 
HHS is getting a 23 percent expan-
sion, including $110 million to research 
the impacts of climate change and $400 
million in Title X funding, which 
Planned Parenthood is now eligible for 
since Democrats are eliminating the 
Hyde amendment. The Department of 
Education will receive a staggering 40 
percent increase in funding, and it just 
gets worse from there. 
Every penny they spend comes at the 
cost of the American taxpayers. 
When Oklahomans lose their jobs, 
Democrats will be to blame. When 
American 
job 
creation 
and 
wage 
growth halts, Democrats will be to 
blame. 
That is why today I am offering 
amendments to each division of this 
package to do one simple thing: cut 
spending by 20 percent. 
Speaker PELOSI doesn’t want fiscal 
accountability, which is why she piled 
all these amendments into an en bloc, 
to ensure none of them pass. 
Congress has spent recklessly this 
past year, and the American people are 
sick of it. 
I want to thank my colleagues who 
have talked about these amendments, 
who have joined me in these amend-
ments, who are wanting to speak 
today, and I urge adoption of this en 
bloc to rein in Democrats’ reckless 
spending and ensure a fiscally secure 
future for generations of Americans to 
come. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
While I have offered this en bloc 
amendment for the purposes of legisla-
tive efficiency, I strongly oppose it. 
The amendment would cut funding 
for important programs and services 
that provide opportunities for working 
families. 
The 
simultaneous 
public 
health and economic crises of the last 
18 months have demonstrated, once 
again, that these programs are under-
funded. They fail to meet the existing 
needs across the country. 
A few examples. This amendment 
would cut Head Start by $2.4 billion. 
That leads to tens of thousands of chil-
dren losing access to high-quality early 
learning programs. 
It cuts the Child Care and Develop-
ment Block Grant by $1.5 billion, at a 
time when parents want to return to 
work, but there is no one available to 
care for their children. 
It cuts the Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program. It is a bipartisan 
priority, but it cuts it by $780 million. 
It cuts senior nutrition, including 
Meals on Wheels, resulting in 25 mil-
lion 
fewer 
home-delivered 
or 
pre-
packaged meals for low-income seniors. 
It cuts biomedical research at the 
National Institutes of Health. It is a 
reduction of 10,000 new grants for po-
tentially lifesaving research. 
It cuts $2 billion from mental health 
and substance use disorder. CDC data 
shows that 93,000 deaths in 2020 were re-
lated to drug overdoses, the highest 
number ever. 
It cuts title I funding for low-income 
public schools, reducing needed re-
sources for 25 million low-income stu-
dents. 
It cuts special education grants to 
States by more than $3 billion. It re-
duces support for services for 7.6 mil-
lion students with disabilities. 
It cuts Federal financial aid pro-
grams—the Pell grants, the FSEOG 
program, and work study—by $5.4 bil-
lion for students and families in need. 
It cuts funding for job training pro-
grams, resulting in fewer supports for 
Americans who are seeking better eco-
nomic opportunities for themselves and 
their families. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska 
(Mr. 
FORTENBERRY), 
the 
ranking member on the Subcommittee 
on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, there is another issue that I am 
compelled to speak about regarding 
spending here. It is called the Hyde 
amendment. 
The Hyde amendment prevents tax-
payer money for abortion, and this has 
remained a bipartisan compact in this 
institution for decades. Before now, lit-
tle in Washington has been this stable 
or stabilizing, with the American peo-
ple in clear agreement. Nearly 60 per-
cent of Americans agree that taxpayer 
money should not be used for abortion. 
Now it is gone. 
When you look at the statistic re-
garding exporting abortion overseas, 
which we will potentially do if all of 
this passes, the percent of American 
people disagreeing with that jumps to 
80 percent. 
That is right, we are about to export 
our most divisive cultural issue, our 
pain, our woundedness, on to the poor 
of the world. Pope Francis has called 
this ideological colonization. It is un-
fair, it is wrong, and it smacks of arro-
gance and elitism. 
Madam Speaker, we really are living 
in an age of contradiction. We say we 
want inclusivity, we say we want toler-
ance, we say we want to be an authen-
tic community and protect the dignity 
and rights of all persons except one 
group of people, the expectant mother 
and her unborn child. Today we will 
break a near 50-year-old agreement to 
not use taxpayer dollars to fund abor-
tion here or overseas. I am heart-
broken. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, the 
Hyde amendment is a discriminatory 
policy. For more than 45 years, it has 
been routinely extended every year as 
a legislative rider, but the time has 
come to reckon with the status quo, a 
status quo that denies health to the 
poor, in this case, disproportionately 
denying people of color health services 
available to those who can afford this 
choice. 
The 
inequities 
in 
our 
country’s 
healthcare system have been exposed 
by COVID–19. Systemic racism makes 
itself felt here, and it is time we insist 
on equality for women, particularly 
women of color. However we feel about 
abortion, we shouldn’t deny health cov-
erage just because someone is working 
to make ends meet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4057 
July 27, 2021 
When Medicaid covers the cost of 
pregnancy-related care, including abor-
tion, it means someone can make a de-
cision based on what is best for their 
circumstances. Thirty-three States and 
the District of Columbia deny State 
funding to women seeking access to 
abortion. As a result, millions of eco-
nomically insecure women in these 
States are hostage to their geography. 
I work every day to advance the re-
spect for life and dignity for every 
human being. I believe that govern-
ment has a moral purpose, and I am 
committed to helping the poor and the 
disadvantaged, 
reducing 
the 
rising 
rates of poverty, taking seriously the 
decision to go to war. 
We cannot pick and choose among 
life issues. Increased access to edu-
cation is a life issue. The COVID–19 
vaccine is a life issue. The Affordable 
Care Act is a life issue. Medicaid ex-
pansion is a life issue. Separating chil-
dren from their families is a life issue. 
Gun violence prevention research is a 
life issue. Food and nutrition assist-
ance, housing and homelessness assist-
ance, supporting background checks, 
addressing climate change are all life 
issues. 
The bills today all address these 
issues, all of which my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle oppose. I am 
proud that the bill we consider today 
moves us forward, ensuring access to 
essential reproductive healthcare serv-
ices. It protects women’s health and 
empowers all women by eliminating 
these riders which for years have al-
lowed certain politicians to insert 
themselves into a woman’s most per-
sonal care decision. The decision to get 
an abortion should be made by a 
woman and her family in consultation 
with her doctor and in accordance with 
her own faith. The decision should not 
be made by people in this Chamber. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1645 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), who is 
all the way from Grandfather Moun-
tain, 
North 
Carolina, 
the 
ranking 
member on the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this funding bill in-
sults the intelligence of every Amer-
ican. Democrats think they can trick 
the American people into supporting 
far-left initiatives if they propose 
enough special interest spending fund-
ed by hardworking U.S. taxpayers. But 
we are not so easily duped. 
This bloated behemoth of a bill frit-
ters away our children’s future on du-
plicative, unnecessary, and unconstitu-
tional 
programs. 
The 
legislation 
emboldens overzealous Federal bureau-
crats to hound businesses struggling to 
recover from the pandemic with exces-
sive Department of Labor enforcement 
actions. 
Tucked away in the legislation’s fine 
print is a scheme to rig union elections 
and undermine the rights of workers. 
The funding package also strips re-
sources from public school students, 
eliminates educational options for vul-
nerable children, gives taxpayer dollars 
to illegal immigrants, and limits op-
portunities for our brave veterans. 
As senior Republican leader of the 
Education and Labor Committee, I re-
ject this radical bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Defense. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the en bloc amend-
ments. These across-the-board 20 per-
cent cuts undermine our historic in-
vestments in education, agriculture, 
housing, 
transportation, 
broadband, 
and many other priorities for American 
families and constituents. 
I want to thank Chair DELAURO and 
my fellow cardinals, as well as our 
dedicated committee staff, for their 
work in crafting a funding package 
that will keep our Nation healthy and 
competitive. 
As vice chair of the Subcommittee on 
Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies, I offer Chair PINGREE
my 
congratulations on an exemplary bill 
that protects human health and the 
health of our environment. In line with 
longstanding bipartisan tradition, this 
Interior bill provides funding to meet 
our Federal investments and treaty ob-
ligations to our Native brothers and 
sisters and Alaska Natives. The sub-
stantial increases in this bill are for 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bu-
reau of Indian Education, and the In-
dian Health Service, and it would all be 
lost with this 20 percent across-the- 
board cut. 
This amendment would slash funding 
for clean water and drinking water in-
frastructure, even as our Nation faces a 
historic drought and contamination 
from PFOS and lead. 
As chair of the Defense Appropria-
tions Subcommittee, I hear from my 
colleagues’ concerns about national se-
curity funding, but the health and 
wellness of the American people, im-
proving our economy, and educating 
our workforce are all critical compo-
nents of a strong Nation, and that is 
the foundation of strong national secu-
rity. 
Every dollar we invest on the domes-
tic 
side 
in 
infrastructure, 
public 
health, and climate change contributes 
to our national security. If we truly 
mean to safeguard our Nation and its 
people, we need the investments made 
in these nondefense bills as well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose these reckless across- 
the-board 20 percent cuts. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT), 
a freshman from Silt, Colorado. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. WOMACK for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today frus-
trated and dismayed because Congress 
continues to act as the Speaker’s 
House rather than the people’s House. 
Debate has been silenced and bipar-
tisan amendments have been rejected 
for political reasons. 
I, myself, submitted 80 amendments 
to this bill, and not a single one was 
made in order. This includes three 
amendments redirecting Federal funds 
from bureaucrats to fight wildfires 
that are burning down the West. Forget 
voting on these commonsense amend-
ments, Democrats won’t even allow de-
bate on them. 
I also filed three amendments to re-
allocate resources to help combat 
drought in the West—all ignored and 
all debate was refused. How about the 
amendments redirecting resources to 
improve veterans’ mental health? Ig-
nored. 
Do you know why the American peo-
ple like Congress less than cock-
roaches, root canals, and Nickelback? 
Because of political garbage like this. 
Speaker PELOSI has silenced my con-
stituents and the American people once 
again. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the chair-
man of the Subcommittee on Transpor-
tation, and Housing and Urban Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to oppose this particu-
larly reckless amendment. Surely, we 
can do better in this body than 
undiscriminating, mindless, across-the- 
board cuts. It doesn’t matter what 
works or what doesn’t. It doesn’t mat-
ter what deserves investment or what 
doesn’t. Just cut it all. 
Look at the damage to individual ini-
tiatives including many, and I have 
singled out some, that Republicans are 
noteworthy for having supported at 
least in the past. 
Think about the FAA’s Contract 
Tower Program that has been so im-
portant for aviation in small commu-
nities; our improvement and certifi-
cation processes for major aircraft; the 
NeighborWorks programs to support 
expansion of affordable housing oppor-
tunities; the housing opportunities in 
this bill for veterans; the supportive 
service for disabled people; housing op-
portunities for all kinds of people in 
need; critical investments in our port 
infrastructure. Funding in this bill in-
creases that by about a third, and on it 
goes. 
This amendment would not encour-
age DOT or HUD to do more with less. 
It would force our constituents to do 
less with less. 
Surely, we can do better than this. 
This is the opposite of responsible, dis-
criminating legislating, and I urge de-
feat of this amendment. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, it is 
a great pleasure to yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
PENCE) from Columbus, Indiana, and a 
respected member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4058 
July 27, 2021 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 4502. 
Inflation, inflation, and inflation, 
this is the biggest thing I hear about 
back in Indiana’s Sixth District. Hoo-
siers in Indiana worry about the con-
sequences the Democrats’ tax and 
spend agenda is having on their pocket-
books. 
After this week, Speaker PELOSI is 
recessing the House until September, 
having done next to nothing to address 
the real issues the American people are 
facing: food, energy, transportation. 
Hardworking folks are already unnec-
essarily paying more. This Biden- 
flation crisis is hitting home. Con-
sumer prices are at a 13-year high. In 
just 6 months, Democratic leadership is 
compounding this crisis with a com-
pletely wasteful, bloated bus. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose these hyperpartisan 
appropriations packages for the good of 
the American people. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CUELLAR), a member of the 
Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Chairwoman DELAURO 
for yielding to me, along with her staff 
for working on these seven bills, along 
with 
the 
ranking 
member, 
KAY 
GRANGER. 
Even though I know we do have some 
differences, I know we will also get to-
gether toward the end of the year. Hav-
ing said that, I stand in opposition to 
the en bloc amendments. 
I also stand in opposition to the re-
cent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
NRC, conduct which runs counter to 
Federal law. The NRC is fighting mas-
sive opposition from elected officials, 
including two Governors, a Democratic 
Governor from New Mexico and a Re-
publican Governor from Texas, and the 
public against the licensing of nuclear 
fuel storage facilities in Texas and New 
Mexico. 
That is why I offered and withdrew 
my 
amendment 
in 
the 
committee 
markup, so we can work and continue 
working as this bill moves forward. 
The NRC not only lacks the consent 
but is acting unilaterally despite clear 
opposition in a bipartisan way. The law 
is very clear. Section 42, U.S. Code 
10155, says that the Governor can dis-
approve—and again, both Governors 
have disapproved. Section 42, U.S. Code 
10166, notice of disapproval, also talks 
about when the Governor gives the dis-
approval. 
Again, the Republican Governor from 
Texas and the Democratic Governor 
from New Mexico have done that. 
The law is clear. They have to follow 
the law, and we must clarify that NRC 
can only license a DOE-monitored re-
trievable storage facility once consent 
has been given by the State and the 
local community. 
I want to thank Chairwoman KAPTUR 
for expressing her willingness to work 
with myself and Ranking Member KAY 
GRANGER on this particular issue that 
is so important to us. 
I am confident that the final version 
of this legislation will clearly establish 
the NRC consent-based licensing ap-
proval standard. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time remains on 
both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas has 43⁄4 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
Connecticut has 41⁄2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN), my 
friend who serves on the Agriculture 
and Education and Labor Committees, 
from a city unlike any other, Augusta, 
Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Arkansas for yield-
ing and also my colleague from Okla-
homa for introducing these common-
sense amendments to rein in spending 
and counteract the bloated spending 
package that our Democrat colleagues 
are ramming through this House. 
It is past time we tighten the purse 
strings in Washington. There is no 
doubt that we are in the midst of a 
Biden 
economic 
crisis, 
thanks 
to 
wasteful Washington spending. 
Just this morning, I hosted a tele-
phone townhall, and I asked my con-
stituents in Georgia’s 12th Congres-
sional District if they are feeling the 
impact 
of 
Biden’s 
inflation. 
Over-
whelmingly, 93 percent said they are 
paying more for everyday goods and 
they got less money every week. 
This inflation is a result of Biden’s 
and congressional Democrats’ spending 
spree, and here we are, debating more 
irresponsible and unrealistic spending 
that will do more to harm the pocket-
books of American families. 
When in the history of civilization 
has any Nation survived this insane 
spending? It is not sustainable. 
Families work hard to live within 
their means and manage their house-
hold budgets, and it is a dereliction of 
duty as elected officials to keep spend-
ing money we don’t have. 
While many American families are 
suffering now due to the rise in infla-
tion, our future generations are the 
ones who will eventually have to pay 
the price. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the Hern amendments so that we 
can start to get our fiscal house back 
under control. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. TRONE), a member of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today as a Member of the House Appro-
priations Committee in opposition to 
this mindless amendment which would 
gut the important investments this bill 
makes on our Nation’s physical and so-
cial infrastructure. 
Our Nation faces an unprecedented 
housing crisis. This bill would ensure 
4.8 million people remain stably housed 
by increasing investments by $8.7 bil-
lion. 
Our Nation’s infrastructure is falling 
apart. This bill provides robust funding 
for highways, transit, rail, and avia-
tion, and we must do better for our Na-
tion’s veterans when it comes to men-
tal health. 
This bill almost doubles the funding 
for the Veterans Suicide Prevention 
and Outreach Program and for the Vet-
erans Crisis Line. These investments 
benefit our constituents from Mont-
gomery County to Garrett County. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chair DELAURO for caring so much for 
all Americans. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote to 
this amendment and support the work 
of the Appropriations Committee. 
b 1700 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to spend my 2 minutes speaking 
directly to the American people. 
We talk a lot in here to each other 
and about each other and to one an-
other and behind each other’s back, but 
I want to speak to the American people 
because they are the ones who need to 
call their Members of Congress. You 
understand that when you increase 
budgets 30 to 40 percent, and then my 
amendments are a 20 percent cut, that 
somehow that is destroying America? 
We know better. 
You, as the American people, know 
that you have to create a budget. Your 
counties create a budget. The cities 
create a budget. Your States create a 
budget. The only place in this free 
United States of America that no budg-
et was created for the last 3 years is 
here in the United States Congress. 
My team on the RSC Budget Com-
mittee produced the only budget that 
was floor-ready for a vote, and the 
Speaker chose not to put it on the 
floor. 
Why, you ask? Well, I am going to 
answer the question. 
It is because the Democrats didn’t 
want you to see what fiscal account-
ability and responsibility are. 
They didn’t put their own budget on 
the floor when they had control of the 
House, the Senate, and the Presidency. 
They could have passed a budget with-
out one single Republican vote. Ask 
your Member of Congress why they 
didn’t produce a budget. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to be fiscally responsible and 
accountable to your money, the tax-
payer’s money. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this amendment. 
We know that decades of Federal dis-
investment have failed the American

July 27, 2021 
people. Yet, this amendment attempts 
to gut the seven appropriations bills 
included in this package that will de-
liver critical funding and services to 
the American people. 
Coming from a coastal State, Rhode 
Island’s roads and bridges cannot with-
stand rising sea levels and more violent 
storms. College students are struggling 
to afford both textbooks and groceries, 
and thousands of Americans do not 
have internet access at home. 
These projects will be addressed by 
the historic investments in working 
people and families included in this 
minibus, but the drastic cuts included 
in this amendment will derail this 
progress. 
This legislation will provide students 
receiving the maximum Pell grant 
with an additional $400 next school 
year, establish a civilian climate corps 
to promote conservation and fight the 
climate crisis, and create thousands of 
well-paying jobs rebuilding our Na-
tion’s infrastructure. 
Notably, it will address some of the 
most pressing challenges facing Rhode 
Islanders by providing over $9 million 
for nine community projects in the 
State. 
I thank Chairwoman DELAURO and 
members of the Committee on Appro-
priations for the extraordinary work 
they have done. This is the set of ap-
propriations bills we can be very proud 
of because it is investing in working 
families. 
I just heard one of my Republican 
colleagues 
squawk 
about 
spending 
money. This is the same group of peo-
ple who voted for $1.2 trillion tax cuts 
for the richest people in this country, 
the biggest corporations—unpaid for— 
and they were all happy with that. 
Madam Speaker, this is different. We 
are investing in working people, in cre-
ating jobs for middle-class families, 
making sure of the investments that 
are necessary to get people back to 
work. This is something we should all 
be proud of. I urge everyone to defeat 
this amendment and pass this bill 
without delay. 
Madam Speaker, again, I end with 
deep gratitude to the extraordinary 
chair of the Committee on Appropria-
tions for putting together appropria-
tions bills that reflect the values of our 
great country. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time is remaining 
on both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas has 21⁄4 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
Connecticut has 11⁄2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, you have heard 
from Members of Congress from all 
across our country, and there was a 
purpose in me identifying their home-
towns. 
These are people who represent real 
American lives, and they are in touch 
with their constituents on a daily 
basis, in Augusta, Georgia; Tulsa, 
Oklahoma; 
Grandfather 
Mountain, 
North Carolina; Silt, Colorado; Lin-
coln, Nebraska; Columbus, Indiana; and 
in my hometown of Rogers, Arkansas. 
They all understand when the Federal 
Government is on a spending spree be-
cause they feel it in their own pockets. 
We 
are 
feeling 
it 
today 
with 
unrivaled inflation that is the result of 
trillions of dollars of taxpayer money 
flowing into this economy. The money 
that is going to the cities and counties, 
it was so much money that we had to 
do it in two tranches. Some of it has 
gone out this year, but there is so 
much that we have to wait until next 
year to send out the remaining $185 bil-
lion or so—money that these counties 
and cities didn’t ask for and, in many 
cases, don’t even need. In fact, they are 
taking suggestions on how best to 
spend it. 
Yet, here we are today, talking about 
a bloated discretionary bill that is 
going to further burden future genera-
tions by adding to deficits and debt. 
Madam Speaker, the interest on our 
debt this year is going to approach $350 
billion. Let me say that again: $350 bil-
lion net interest on the debt, which 
would pay for more than half of the ti-
tles that we are debating here today of 
around $600 billion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
the amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment would cut Head Start, cut 
childcare, cut low-income home energy 
assistance, cut senior nutrition, cut 
biomedical research, cut mental health 
programs, cut title I for low-income 
public schools, cut special education, 
cut Federal financial aid programs like 
Pell grants and work-study programs, 
and cut funding for job training, and so 
much more. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. 
DELAURO). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

At the end of division C (before the short

SEC. ll. None of the funds made available 
by this Act under the heading ‘‘Department 
of Energy—Fossil Energy and Carbon Man-
agement’’ may be used for any research and 
development activity other than an activity 
that has been prioritized by the Secretary 
pursuant to section 961(a)(3) of the Energy 
Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16291(a)(3)). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. WOMACK) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 45 seconds. 
Madam Speaker, the en bloc amend-
ment includes a number of proposals 
offered by Members on both sides of the 
aisle. It includes amendments offered 
by both Democrats and Republicans 
and several offered jointly by Members 
of both parties on which the vast ma-
jority of this body can agree. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this bipartisan en bloc, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and rise in opposition for a num-
ber of reasons, some of which we will 
detail in a more articulate way here as 
the debate continues. But suffice it to 
say that we have thrown a lot of money 
at the economy of the United States of 
America. While I realize that part of 
our function in government is to fund 
the discretionary programs of the U.S. 
Government—and that is an important 
function of our Committee on Appro-
priations—we have seen the other side 
take the opportunity to capitalize on a 
real crisis moment in our country, that 
being the coronavirus phenomenon. 
Trillions and trillions of dollars have 
gone out the door, fueling inflation and 
creating real problems for people at 
home who are experiencing rising costs 
in virtually everything that a con-
sumer would purchase, from gasoline 
to groceries. You name it, those costs 
are escalating. 
It is not for any reason other than 
the fact that we have poured trillions 
and trillions of dollars into the econ-
omy while at the same time these very 
same policies have caused a lot of peo-
ple not to work. We have incentivized 
this notion that they could stay at 
home and made it more lucrative than 
actually going to work. 
The people that we are going to ask 
to make things, build things, and 
produce things are the very people that 
haven’t been functioning. As a result of 
that, the supply chain has been weak-
ened. So, now, because of simple supply 
and demand, there are fewer products, 
and those products are going higher. As 
I say, simple supply and demand phi-
losophies. 
But here we are today, basically add-
ing about 20 percent across the spec-
trum of these seven titles of discre-
tionary budget. A lot of these are very, 
very good programs, programs that we 
have all supported in the past. But 
with the amount of money that has 
gone to the coronavirus phenomenon, 
and the fact that a lot of that money 
has not been spent—I think the report 
this week by the GAO was $1 trillion of 
unobligated funds out of coronavirus. 
Here we are, adding insult to injury by 
compounding the problem by adding 
more to the nondefense discretionary 
side of the budget. 
Now, we will reserve the argument 
for a little later on what we are doing 
to national security by not pumping 
dollars into national security against 
the known threats that we have around 
the country. But as I said, we will save 
that argument for another day. 
We are going to argue and continue 
to argue that this is spending way too 
much money. The American people 
know that. That is why there has to be 
an adult voice in the room to bring 
these subjects to the light of day, and 
that is what our purpose will be today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend, the chair of the 
Committee on Appropriations. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my amendment to block funding the 
DeVos title IX rule. 
Just imagine: You have endured the 
horror of campus sexual assault, and 
now you are asked to relive your trau-
ma with live hearings and direct cross-

examination. You are told where you 
must be assaulted and how much you 
must suffer before you can avail your-
self of your civil rights. God forbid you 
are assaulted while studying abroad or 
an off-campus frat party—title IX may 
be closed off to you. Or you are among 
the one in three survivors who drop out 
of college, so now your school is forbid-
den from investigating the complaint. 
It is cruel. It is inhumane. It under-
mines student safety and equal access 
to education. 
Madam Speaker, title IX should pre-
vent sex discrimination, not enable it. 
That is why I appreciate this amend-
ment being taken up. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. ISSA), a distinguished 
Member—and may I say a freshman 
Member, although he is a returning 
Member from before—a respected mem-
ber of Committees on Foreign Affairs 
and the Judiciary and the former 
chairman of the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform in the Congress of 
the United States. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
everyone here for giving serious consid-
eration to amendment No. 24 to H.R. 
4502. 
Madam Speaker, I speak today with 
my colleagues to support an expansion 
that was done under the last adminis-
tration that has had a profound and 
positive effect on apprenticeships. 
b 1715 
The amendment would simply allow 
funding to be available for the imple-
mentation of the Department of La-
bor’s Industry-Recognized Apprentice-
ship Programs, otherwise known as 
IRAP. 
In 2017, former President Trump 
acted to enhance the skills and train-
ing options for all Americans so they 
may compete in today’s jobs. IRAP ex-
panded 
high-quality 
apprenticeship 
programs with a focus on rapidly grow-
ing industries like healthcare and 
STEM-based positions. 
IRAP apprenticeships were unique 
from the traditional government pro-
grams in that they were designed to be 
more nimble and responsive to the 
changing workforce that we find our-
selves in today. Engaging in learning 
with new programs doesn’t fit the old 
model, and the IRAP expansion is ex-
tremely important for the following 
reason. I support the apprenticeship 
programs that all of us are familiar 
with, the skilled trades and the like; 
but, in fact, today there are new skills 
that are being developed in which the 
curriculum must be nimble and must 
change. 
In just 4 months of operation, the 
program had 131 new offerings in the 
healthcare field alone. 
What better time than in the middle 
of a pandemic would there be to try to 
enhance nursing and nursing-like skills 
to be advanced? 
This is a time in which we are criti-
cally short in these areas, and with the 
return of a new variant of coronavirus 
we could well find ourselves in des-
perate need of a quick turnaround of 
new apprentices. If we permit this pro-
gram to continue, it will eventually 
support 2 million new apprenticeships. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to look at this in the most 
open and positive way, nothing could 
be more important today—particularly 
to the healthcare community—than, in 
fact, to expand flexible apprentice-
ships. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, as a 
testament to the gentleman’s amend-
ment, I am a proud cosponsor of that 
particular 
amendment 
and 
I 
am 
pleased that he has offered such. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
misspoke earlier. This en bloc amend-
ment includes a number of proposals 
offered by my Democratic colleagues, 
and it reflects our shared values of in-
vesting in the American people to cre-
ate good paying jobs, grow oppor-
tunity, and provide a lifeline to the 
vulnerable; and I urge support. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for her hard 
work on this excellent piece of legisla-
tion, the staff and Democratic mem-
bers of the committee, and all Mem-
bers across the aisle for their hard 
work on these very important issues. 
I rise today in support of my two 
amendments to division B of H.R. 4502. 
These two amendments draw much- 
needed attention to the energy-water 
nexus. Energy and water development 
systems have become more vulnerable 
as water scarcity and uncertainty have 
become more pronounced in the West. 
It is time for a more integrated ap-
proach to addressing challenges and op-
portunities, and my amendments en-
courage our government agencies to 
improve underlying data collection and 
analysis. 
My first amendment encourages the 
Energy Information Administration to 
conduct a more robust analysis and 
data collection of water consumption 
in the commercial and residential sur-
veys and to make the information pub-
licly available. 
My second amendment encourages 
the Bureau of Reclamation to address 
the energy consumption from their 
pumping stations to better understand 
the 
opportunities 
for 
energy 
effi-
ciencies and to reduce energy use 
measures. 
Better 
data 
and 
analysis 
are 
foundational to identifying efficiencies 
in the face of climate change, espe-
cially in States where water processing 
uses a large portion of the energy budg-
et. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption 
of these amendments. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR). 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Castor amendment. 
America’s public schools, colleges, 
and universities are the engines of eco-
nomic opportunity, and our funding 
package provides historic investments 
in students and schools at a time when 
they need it, especially in Florida 
where the Governor and legislature are 
intentionally undercutting our public 
school students and local control. 
Florida, the third largest State in 
the country, ranks 45th in per pupil 
funding, and it diverts an enormous 
amount of public money to for-profit 
charter schools that are not account-
able and often fail to provide the full 
range of educational services required 
by law like those for special needs and 
disabled students. 
When my local school board in 
Hillsborough County recently ques-
tioned the quality of education pro-
vided by certain for-profit charters, the 
State 
Commissioner 
of 
Education 
threatened to withhold money from 
students and schools—the fifth largest 
district in the entire country. 
Many for-profit charter corporations 
need oversight by the U.S. Department 
of Education especially in Florida 
where they skirt civil rights laws and 
they weaken our traditional public 
schools. 
So I thank my colleagues on the Ap-
propriations Committee for the over-
sight measures included in this bill 
that will help ensure that every child 
has an opportunity to learn and suc-
ceed, especially the students in Florida 
who deserve better. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
my amendment. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD), who is a member 
of the Budget and Education and Labor 
Committees. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in support of my three amend-
ments to GOP en bloc 1. 
My first two amendments would cut 
wasteful spending in the SNAP contin-
gency fund which functions as a bu-
reaucratic slush fund for the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. Though its pur-
ported use is for emergencies, the funds 
sit unused in an agency account just 
waiting for the Democrats or career 
bureaucrats to come along and direct it 
at their will. 
My amendments would strike the 
funding for $3 billion directed toward 
this fund in the bill and rescind all of 
the money currently in the fund, effec-
tively abolishing the slush fund from 
being piled up by the majority. Con-
gress should not have to play whack-a- 
mole with slush funds for the other 
side. 
My final amendment would simply 
strike the provision in this bill prohib-
iting 
any 
limitation 
on 
Federal 
telework or union activity on official 
Federal time and in Federal office

space. This House is about to vote to 
require American taxpayers to con-
tinue to pay for bureaucrats to phone 
it in from home and perform union ac-
tivities while on the taxpayer dime. 
In short, Congress is subsidizing bad 
service to the taxpayers. 
Remote work has created a backlog 
of over 2 million passport applications. 
I expect that everybody in this body is 
hearing from their constituents, as I 
am, about the backlog for passport ap-
plications. If someone needs a passport 
sooner than 4 to 5 months now, their 
only option is to pay an additional fee 
to expedite the process to 12 weeks. 
That is the expedited timeframe, 12 
weeks with an extra fee. 
The House is now debating a govern-
ment funding bill that prevents the 
ability of Federal managers to end 
telework and require that union activi-
ties be performed outside of Federal 
time and away from Federal office 
space. We must stop rewarding workers 
for not showing up for work. 
Without my amendment, this bill is 
nothing more than an abuse of the 
American taxpayer. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support these amendments. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I am 
so grateful to the appropriators for in-
cluding seven funding priorities for my 
district, El Paso, Texas, in the base 
bills, including funding for health tech-
nology upgrades, police body cameras, 
drinking water and wastewater infra-
structure, and much more. 
Each year I work to bring El Paso’s 
voice to the table, and my amendments 
focus on our priorities. 
These amendments include increased 
funding for the Office of Civil Rights at 
the Department of Education to sup-
port economically disadvantaged com-
munities; emphasizing the need for a 
binational COVID–19 vaccination plan; 
funding for water reuse programs in 
communities 
experiencing 
drought 
conditions; and several amendments di-
recting funding towards communities 
like El Paso, so we aren’t left behind in 
the fight against the climate crisis; 
and so much more. 
Lastly, we have witnessed congres-
sionally appropriated funding being ir-
responsibly diverted by Governors in 
States like mine, so I am happy to see 
all subcommittees under this bill in-
clude my congressional intent amend-
ment expressing a strong urgency to 
ensure that States can no longer do 
this. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut. As I would want her to know, 
I am ecstatic about the great leader-
ship of her chairwomanship as well as 
all the Cardinals who have worked, and 
I thank my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, many of whom really 
know that this is a very, very fine re-
sponse to the needs of the American 
people. 
Might I just say to the chair of the 
Appropriations Committee, just very 
quickly, that I was here for the Hyde 
amendment. I was on the Judiciary 
Committee. I think my colleagues need 
to understand that for all the years of 
the Hyde committee, women who were 
poor, who were Medicaid recipients, 
many of them might have died in child-
birth and might have had other impor-
tant emergency health issues because 
they were subjected to decisions that 
they did not make for themselves. In 
that instance, we have discriminated 
against women just because of their 
poverty. 
Again, abortion is that of the woman, 
her faith, and her family. I believe this 
eliminating of the Hyde amendment is 
finally saying to all women in America 
that we respect you and your bodies. 
I am very grateful for the support of 
an amendment that recognizes the cri-
sis of diabetes and the need for re-
search professionals and patients par-
ticipating in clinical trials. Diversity 
in medical trials is essential to ensur-
ing that cures, especially vaccines and 
therapies, work for the greatest num-
ber of persons. So my amendment de-
creases and increases the amount for 
$10 million to emphasize and get more 
emphasis to develop that diversity pool 
in research professionals and patients 
participating in trials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCANLON). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman from Texas an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Diabetes im-
pacts all social, economic, and ethnic 
backgrounds, 
particularly 
African 
Americans. I meet many people in my 
constituency who have had an amputa-
tion because they were not able to re-
ceive medical care. 
Finally, I have an amendment that 
increases and decreases funds $10 mil-
lion with the intent of supporting indi-
viduals who might not finish college 
because of the impact of COVID. 
COVID is now resurging but the delta 
variant is surging. People are being 
hospitalized, the unvaccinated. 
I make a national plea for people to 
be vaccinated. 
As well it is impacting young people. 
That means that we need to focus on 
young people getting vaccinated. They 
are in college. We don’t know, if they 
are not vaccinated, how it will impact 
their education and their future life. 
So this is to provide the targeting 
programs to reach out to young people 
to tell them: One, get vaccinated. But 
to give them a bridge so that their edu-
cation will not be interrupted, that 
they will never go back again, and that 
they will not suffer economically. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my 
amendments being brought to the 
floor. I thank the leadership and as 
well I thank leadership for all the com-
munity projects that are helping the 
impoverished in my district. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc 
Amendment No. 2 to Rules Committee Print 
117–12, which incorporates Jackson Lee 
Amendments Nos. 25 and 26. 
I thank the Rules Committee for making 
these amendments in order and Agriculture 
Appropriations Subcommittee Chair DELAURO 
for including them in this En Bloc Amendment.

Jackson Lee Amendment #25, increases 
and decreases funds by $10,000,000 increase 
in funding to support greater diversity in the 
pool of diabetes research professionals and 
patients participating in clinical trials. 
Diversity in medical trials is essential to en-
suring that cures, especially vaccines, and 
therapies, work for the greatest number of per-
sons impacted by an illness. 
34.2 million people, or 10.5 percent of the 
U.S. population, have diabetes. An estimated 
26.8 million people—or 10.2 percent of the 
population—have been diagnosed with diabe-
tes. 
Approximately 7.3 million people have dia-
betes but have not yet been diagnosed 
(2018). 
Diabetes impacts all social, economic, and 
ethnic backgrounds, particularly African Ameri-
cans. 
Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5.2 per-
cent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes, affect-
ing approximately 1.6 million people. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #26 increases and 
decreases funds by $10,000,000 with the in-
tent of supporting programs that provide out-
reach and support services targeting program 
participants at greatest risk of not completing 
a college degree due to COVID–19 education 
disruption. 
I urge all Members to vote En Bloc Amend-
ment #2. 
Mr. WOMACK. I reserve the balance 
of my time, Madam Speaker. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 4502. This 
appropriations minibus makes historic 
critical investments in North Caro-
lina’s Sixth District and in all of our 
communities. 
This bill invests in new jobs and the 
future of our workforce with $11.6 bil-
lion for the Employment and Training 
Administration at the Department of 
Labor. 
It creates greater opportunities for 
students to succeed with increased 
funding for title 1 grants, HBCUs, and 
primarily 
minority-serving 
colleges 
and universities, and an increase in 
Pell grants. 
It provides much-needed funding for 
the health, equity, safety, and well- 
being of our communities with funds 
for public health infrastructure, mater-
nal and child health, and mental 
health. It also takes long overdue ac-
tion to defend health and reproductive 
rights by repealing the discriminatory 
Hyde and Weldon amendments.

July 27, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of this bill to 
support the needs of families and com-
munities across the country. 
b 1730 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, 
long before COVID–19, the education of 
our most vulnerable students, particu-
larly Black and Brown girls and stu-
dents with disabilities, had been dis-
rupted by discriminatory and harsh 
discipline practices. 
As early as preschool, discriminatory 
policies and practices push them out of 
the classroom. This push-out crisis and 
its disproportionate impact on our 
girls continued even as the pandemic 
hit and schools went remote. 
Last year, we learned the story of 
Grace, a 15-year-old Black student who 
was sent to juvenile detention for not 
completing her online coursework. At a 
time where our children needed to be 
kept safe in a volatile crisis, Grace was 
dehumanized and taken away from her 
family and her health put at risk. 
Advocates across the Nation, includ-
ing my colleagues and I, rallied to call 
for Grace’s release. We were so grateful 
she safely made her way home to her 
mother, but her experience is far too 
common. 
My amendment underscores the need 
for the GAO to study the prevalence of 
these practices during remote learning 
periods and provide recommendations 
on how we can work to urgently ad-
dress this crisis. 
Our young people deserve nurturing, 
learning environments that support 
their healing and well-being. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, al-
most 20 years ago our country began 
sending brave servicemembers on de-
ployment after deployment during the 
global war on terror. Around the world, 
they faced dangers not just from the 
enemy, 
but 
also 
from 
the 
cir-
cumstances of their service. 
Too many of those who served in 
areas of toxic exposure now bear life- 
long illness in exchange for the secu-
rity they provided to all of us. 
And too many of those who faced the 
traumas of combat or sexual assault, 
now bear unseen and often debilitating 
burdens on their mental health. 
This is why I introduced two amend-
ments to this bill. The first directs $1 
million to Burn Pits Centers of Excel-
lence, one of which is located in East 
Orange, New Jersey, for critical re-
search. 
The second directs $10 million to ex-
pand vet center counseling services to 
additional locations, including in my 
district where a new vet center is badly 
needed. 
Our veterans deserve the best treat-
ment available, whether their injuries 
are physical or mental. We owe it to 
them to support this funding. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. VALADAO). 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in favor of my 
amendment No. 64 to division B. 
This amendment highlights the need 
to replenish the agriculture disaster 
assistance account of USDA’s Wildfire 
and 
Hurricane 
Indemnity 
Program 
Plus. This funding would cover agricul-
tural producers’ losses in 2020 and 2021 
due to natural disasters. 
Some of the other types of natural 
disasters this program funding helps 
includes droughts, derechos, floods, ex-
treme freezes, high winds, hurricanes, 
snowstorms, tornados, typhoons, vol-
canic activity, and wildfires. One of the 
most pertinent disasters this program 
addresses is extreme drought. 
It is no secret that the American 
West, including my district in the Cen-
tral Valley in California, is currently 
suffering from a devastating, historic 
drought. One of the main purposes of 
the Central Valley Project system is to 
provide water to users during years of 
extreme drought. 
We are in year one of an extreme 
drought, and wells are going extremely 
dry and farmland is being fallowed at 
an alarming rate. This is completely 
unacceptable. While we continue to 
work to prevent this from happening 
again in the future, we also need to fig-
ure out a way to help those who are un-
necessarily suffering from the drought 
immediately. 
My constituents and the constituents 
of many of my colleagues here today 
are in an emergency and need this 
funding to be included in the fiscal 
year 2022 package. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY), my friend 
from Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, a gen-
eral, who is a very respected member of 
the Foreign Affairs and Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committees. 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
the 
good 
gentleman, 
Mr. 
WOMACK, for this opportunity to speak. 
Madam Speaker, I have three amend-
ments to this legislation. Amendment 
No. 180, this amendment strikes a pro-
vision allowing the HHS Secretary to 
use $7.8 million to hire and purchase 
electric vehicles and electric vehicle 
charging stations. 
If bureaucrats at HHS want to own 
their own $80,000-plus Tesla, that is 
great, they should purchase it. But 
they shouldn’t require the taxpayers to 
pay for that kind of thing. They could 
do the work that they need to do with-
out an electric vehicle. 
Amendment 121 strikes EVs from the 
GSA. Here again, the GSA want to pur-
chase these vehicles with your money. 
Look, if they want do that on their 
own, that is fine. If you consider the 
post office, these vehicles are often-
times heavier than your regular vehi-
cle, but the post office has 200,000 of 
these vehicles and that is what they 
want to purchase with them. 
And just keep in mind that these ve-
hicles don’t pay into the Highway 
Trust Fund, so they are heavier, more 
maintenance, but not paying anything. 
Finally, 
amendment 
124, 
which 
strikes the exemption for green vehicle 
purchases. The underlying text sets the 
limit at about $20,000. So if we are 
going to purchase a vehicle, that is 
great, you need to do your work. If you 
are working for government, you get 
$20,000 for a vehicle to do it. You don’t 
need to ride in some kind of special 
luxury. But they set an exemption for 
these vehicles, because they want to 
buy an $80,000 vehicle and exempt the 
$20,000 that the rest of us have to deal 
with in the public. 
So this amendment would just say, 
no, we are not going to make the ex-
emption. You are going to spend the 
$20,000 on the best vehicle for the tax-
payer and for the government. If it is 
an electric vehicle, so be it; if it is not, 
so be it. The market should dictate and 
the market can dictate. 
The government shouldn’t be picking 
winners and losers and forcing us tax-
payers to pay for exorbitant electric 
vehicles because my friends on the left 
think that is the way to go. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Ms. BUSH). 
Ms. 
BUSH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
St. 
Louis and I rise today in support of our 
amendments to H.R. 4502. 
Our first amendment provides $5 mil-
lion more to support healthcare serv-
ices, COVID–19 testing and vaccines, 
behavioral health services, and pre-
ventative care for our unhoused com-
munities. As a nurse and someone who 
has been unhoused, I have both lived 
and witnessed the traumatic realities 
of inaccessible healthcare. This fund-
ing will save lives. 
My second amendment reduces fund-
ing for fossil energy and carbon man-
agement by $4 million and adds $3 mil-
lion for energy efficiency and renew-
able energy. Environmental justice 
leaders are demanding that we stop 
subsidizing supposedly advanced tech-
nologies that keep fossil fuels burning 
in our communities, and build public 
renewable energy instead. 
Our third amendment supports $100 
million in a new pilot funding for men-
tal health crisis response by directing 
the 
GAO 
to 
study 
health-based, 
nonpunative, 
and 
noncarceral 
ap-
proaches to public safety. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I have three amendments that 
I am asking our colleagues to support. 
They are bipartisan amendments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4064 
July 27, 2021 
The first is a redirection of $3 million 
to the Centers for Disease Control for 
Lyme disease. I would point out to my 
colleagues that I have been working on 
Lyme disease issues since 1992, and we 
tried very hard for years to get a fed-
eral working group up and running. 
And in 2016, we did it. 
The Health and Human Services 
Tick-Borne Disease Working Group 
found that there are about 300,000 new 
cases of Lyme every year. The higher 
estimate or guesstimate is 476,000 cases 
each year. It is exploding all over this 
country, particularly in the northeast 
where the chair, obviously, comes 
from, as do I. It is highly endemic in 
New Jersey. This additional money 
brings the total to $24 million for CDC 
to work on issues related to Lyme. 
Amendment 51, the second amend-
ment, has do with LymeX. It provides 
$5 million, through give and take, and 
underscores that we really believe the 
LymeX Innovation Accelerator will 
help find new diagnostics, research, 
and treatments. 
What the working group found and 
then what an NIH document produced 
by Secretary Azar, and others, found, 
was that we really don’t have a diag-
nostic that works. We don’t have a 
Lyme testing capability that is reli-
able and affordable. 
And, finally, years ago I founded, 
along with my good friend and col-
league, MIKE DOYLE, the Autism Cau-
cus. We have been leading it for over 20 
years. We have done a number of bills, 
including the Autism CARES Act, that 
have become law. Amendment 52 would 
provide $10 million to help the CDC’s 
developmental disabilities account to 
expand the Autism Developmental Dis-
ability Monitoring Network, or ADDM, 
and at least nine new sites could be es-
tablished. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, the ADDM network has been 
incredible in tracking children and 
young people to help us understand the 
prevalence. You can’t combat some-
thing if there is no solid data. This 
ADDM network has been a tremendous 
asset. This amendment would expand 
it. So I thank my friend for yielding 
and I thank the committee chair for 
her support. I thank the Rules Com-
mittee for having made the amend-
ments in order. It will make a dif-
ference. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I will just take the 
remaining few seconds of my time just 
to say this. As an appropriator, I am 
not a big fan of how all of this is being 
choreographed and structured, but I 
also recognize that time is not on our 
side. People witnessing this event, 
probably are not real sure what these 
en blocs are all about, but it is a simple 
way to save a little bit of time. 
Frankly, I think we ought to get 
back to regular order, where we can 
have a full-throated debate, an open 
rule, if you will, and just talk about 
each one of these very important issues 
one by one, and truly represent the will 
of the American people. That is what 
the Congress is here for. It was what it 
was built for. 
However, I do recognize that given 
the political circumstances we are in 
today, and the fact that we don’t have 
a lot of time, that this is what we are 
left with. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the en bloc and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support the en 
bloc, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. 
DELAURO). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. WOMACK) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
b 1745 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 45 seconds. 
This is an en bloc amendment and in-
cludes a number of proposals offered by 
Members on both sides of the aisle. It 
includes amendments offered by both 
Democrats and Republicans and several 
offered jointly by Members of both par-
ties on which the vast majority of this 
body can agree. 
I urge support for this bipartisan en 
bloc, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
won’t belabor the point that I made a 
few minutes ago that I am not a big fan 
of this process, but there does come a 
time in the process where we come to 
some agreement on things, and I guess 
we are at that stage of the game. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pearland, Texas (Mr. WEBER). 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in support of amendment No. 
109 within this en bloc. 
My amendment identifies an imme-
diate need of the United States nuclear 
industry, the need to provide full fund-
ing for construction of the Department 
of Energy, the DOE, versatile test reac-
tor project. 
As ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Energy for the Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee, I 
know that there is no clean energy fu-
ture without advanced nuclear. The 
best vehicle to accelerate us down the 
road of emissions reductions is nuclear 
energy. 
The versatile test reactor is an abso-
lutely critical piece of DOE’s R&D in-
frastructure that will allow U.S. nu-
clear researchers to validate and test a 
wide range of advanced reactor designs 
right here in the good old U.S. of A. 
Any responsible U.S. nuclear energy 
strategy must include robust support 
for this facility. 
Madam Speaker, last Congress, as 
part of the sweeping nuclear provisions 
in the Energy Act of 2020, we were able 
to authorize robust funding for the 
versatile test reactor. It was a tremen-
dous bipartisan—that my friend from 
Arkansas is pointing out—achievement 
I was proud to lead. But this authoriza-
tion is all for naught without the year-
ly appropriations to back it up. 
That is why I am very concerned to 
see that the 2022 appropriations bill 
provides no funds, zero, zip, zilch, nada, 
to keep the versatile test reactor 
project on budget and on schedule. 
If we are serious about our clean en-
ergy future, Madam Speaker, and we 
want to decrease our dependence on 
competitors like China and Russia for 
advanced nuclear R&D, we must com-
mit to our investment in this essential 
research infrastructure. 
The United States can and should 
lead the world in advanced nuclear. 
Moving forward, I will continue to 
work with my colleagues to prioritize 
nuclear innovation and keep America 
safe, energy independent, and globally 
competitive. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my bipartisan amend-
ment No. 10 that would bolster agricul-
tural research. 
This amendment, offered with my co- 
chair of the Ag Research Caucus, ROD-
NEY DAVIS from Illinois, would support 
farmers all across the country in their 
ongoing efforts to produce bigger, 
safer, 
sustainable, 
and 
more 
agri-
culture. 
In my district, on the central coast 
of California, otherwise known as the 
Salad Bowl of the World, with its hun-
dreds of specialty crops, the farmers 
depend on USDA research programs, 
not just to survive but to succeed. 
Two of those key programs that our 
amendment funds are the Agricultural 
and Food Research Initiative, or AFRI, 
and the Agriculture Advanced Re-
search and Development Authority, 
also known as AGARDA. 
AFRI is the Nation’s leading com-
petitive grants program for agriculture 
research. Our amendment funds it with 
$450 million, a $15 million increase 
from last year. 
AGARDA is a new program that was 
authorized in the 2018 farm bill, and for 
the first time, it is now funded with $2 
million. 
During the pandemic, Madam Speak-
er, it was clear that the work of our 
farmers and farmworkers is absolutely 
essential. The least that we can do in 
Congress is to provide this type of 
funding for the necessary research that 
will help not just our recovery right 
now, but it will also ensure food secu-
rity for our future. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tipton, Michigan, Michi-
gan’s Seventh District (Mr. WALBERG), 
a valued and respected member of the 
Education and Labor and Energy and 
Commerce Committees. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my amendment to di-
vision A, which provides critical fund-
ing for the Office of Labor-Manage-
ment Standards, OLMS, at the Depart-
ment of Labor. 
OLMS is vital to protecting the 
rights of workers in the workplace and 
ensuring 
labor-management 
trans-
parency and financial integrity in our 
Nation’s labor unions. 
Unfortunately, 
House 
Democrats 
have chosen to underfund the agency 
since taking the majority, resulting in 
diminished staffing levels and signifi-
cantly impacting the types of work ac-
complished in the field and throughout 
the agency. Sadly, the appropriations 
package we are considering today con-
tinues this trend by once again under-
funding the office. 
My amendment would simply in-
crease the funding to be in line with 
President Biden’s budget request. In 
the President’s request, the Depart-
ment noted that funding was necessary 
to restore OLMS’ ability to provide 
unionized workers with the protections 
they are entitled under LMRDA. 
Protecting the paychecks of hard-
working union members is my priority, 
and I hope it is the priority of my col-
leagues as well. 
Additionally, I rise to support my 
amendment to division E, which ad-
dresses two of the most serious public 
health concerns affecting Michigan and 
the Great Lakes States. PFAS con-
tamination and harmful algal blooms 
have wreaked serious damage in our 
rivers, streams, lakes, and, ultimately, 
drinking water. 
Many States like mine have been ag-
gressively testing, tracking, and work-
ing to combat PFAS for years. But 
there is still much more we don’t know 
about these chemicals, and it will take 
collaboration from Federal, State, and 
local officials to prevent future expo-
sure, protect the public health, and en-
sure the safety of our drinking water. 
At the same time, harmful algal 
blooms, HABs, affect marine, coastal, 
estuarine, and freshwater systems in 
all 50 States and are particularly prev-
alent in the Great Lakes. These toxic 
blooms harm human health and cause 
several billion dollars in economic 
losses each year. 
My amendment supports investments 
in science, research, and management 
to increase our capacity to detect and 
prevent HABs and PFAS throughout 
the country. 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
important amendments. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of the en bloc pack-
ages. 
My first amendment adjusts Federal 
investments for the Federal Highway 
Administration to defund an expensive, 
unsightly, and unnecessary 60-foot- 
high artificial rock wall on I–80 in War-
ren County in my district. I encourage, 
instead, a safer, smarter option. 
The community which sits next to 
the beautiful Delaware Water Gap, one 
of Jersey’s greatest natural treasures, 
believes this rock wall will be ineffec-
tive and that it will wreak havoc on 
the area’s ecotourism. I couldn’t agree 
more. 
This amendment makes clear that 
congressional intent is for no Federal 
funds to be used for the construction of

an artificial wall between mileposts 
1.04 and 1.45 along I–80 in Knowlton and 
Hardwick 
Townships, 
New 
Jersey. 
There are safer, better options. 
My second amendment makes it 
clear that Federal investments for the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration must help ad-
dress the COVID–19-linked substance 
abuse and mental health issues affect-
ing far too many children and young 
adults in our country. The pandemic 
has caused a historic rate of mental 
health issues, especially with our stu-
dents, and we must help them get the 
support they need. It is just heart- 
wrenching. 
My final amendment prioritizes clean 
drinking water because every child 
should have access to water at school 
that is free of lead that can cause great 
harm to them. This amendment adjusts 
the Federal CDC environmental health 
investment, creating congressional in-
tent to help ensure that school drink-
ing water is free of lead and dangerous 
chemicals. We must protect children in 
north Jersey and nationwide from dan-
gerous chemicals and lead in their 
drinking water. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this bipartisan en bloc set of amend-
ments. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from San Angelo, Texas (Mr. 
PFLUGER), a very distinguished mem-
ber of the freshman class of this Con-
gress, a member of the Foreign Affairs 
and Homeland Security Committees. I 
am proud of his service to our country 
in uniform as a pilot of that F–22. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the much-need-
ed student dormitory project at Good-
fellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, 
Texas. 
The district I represent is at a cru-
cial crossroads of national security, en-
ergy security, and agriculture security 
that makes our Nation stronger. At the 
heart of this district sits Goodfellow, 
home to the training of over 12,000 air-
men, soldiers, sailors, marines, and 
guardians every single year who do in-
telligence work and also in the train-
ing of fire. 
Goodfellow plays a really critical 
role in continuing to provide world- 
class intelligence, surveillance, and re-
connaissance, as well as that fire res-
cue that I just mentioned. 
The national security demands of our 
Nation are quickly outpacing the ca-
pacity of Goodfellow to house the ever- 
growing stream of new students. The 
base is currently experiencing a drastic 
shortage of housing. In fact, to meet 
this shortage, the base has entered into 
an agreement with Angelo State Uni-
versity for the use of their dorms to 
ease the capacity concerns. 
While ASU is a proud and willing 
partner with Goodfellow, this is not a 
permanent solution. We cannot expect 
our communities to shoulder these bur-
dens forever. 
This project is vital to the national 
security mission that Goodfellow pro-
vides to the country and to that of the 
Concho Valley community. It is imper-
ative that Air Force Education and 
Training 
Command 
maintain 
this 
project as a top priority. 
I am also offering an amendment to-
night, and I rise in support of that, to 
strike the funding for the expensive 
and unreliable electric vehicle pur-
chases by the United States Postal 
Service. 
Let me be clear. We cannot maintain 
a functioning and prosperous country 
without affordable, reliable energy. 
Yet, my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are completely bent on pur-
suing a feel-good green energy policy 
to pat themselves on the backs in the 
name of saving the environment. 
But the truth is, they are not im-
proving the environment. They are ac-
tually destroying the prosperity and 
security of our country by doing so. 
During several days of brutal cold in 
Texas, the city of Austin saw its fleet 
of 12 new electric buses rendered com-
pletely inoperative during the power 
outages. By allowing the USPS to go to 
an all-electric fleet, we are basically 
saying that when the weather is too 
hot, too cold, not windy enough, with 
not enough sun, Americans will not 
have their mail service. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amend-
ment and others. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, my amendment increases the Fossil 
Energy and Carbon Management ac-
count by $50 million and decreases it 
by the same amount. 
I want to thank the bipartisan group 
of cosponsors, including Representative 
MCCAUL, Representative JACKSON LEE, 
Representative BURGESS, Representa-
tive 
FLETCHER, 
Representative 
CUELLAR, 
Representative 
CRENSHAW, 
and Representative BRADY. 
I offered this amendment because we 
must prioritize Carbon Utilization Pro-
gram activities that are consistent 
with our existing energy statute. 
In and around my district in Hous-
ton, the energy capital of the world, 
important carbon capture research is 
taking place. Carbon capture utiliza-
tion seeks to improve our community’s 
air quality and maintain and provide 
jobs for workers, many in my district. 
Therefore, my amendment just clari-
fies that carbon capture utilization re-
search, along with other carbon cap-
ture projects specified in the com-
mittee report, are also recognized and 
prioritized in this bill. 
b 1800 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY), the distin-
guished Republican leader of our con-
ference, all the way from Bakersfield, 
California. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the gentleman from Ar-
kansas for yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my amendment to division E that 
would prioritize funding for critically 
important U.S. Forest Service initia-
tives, to mitigate safety hazards, to re-
open and rehabilitate the Sequoia Na-
tional Forest following the devastating 
SQF Complex fire. 
Giant sequoias are the largest trees 
in the world. Some tower over 26 sto-
ries high and grow wider than a city 
street. They can only be found growing 
naturally on the eastern slopes of the 
Sierra Nevada mountain range in Cali-
fornia, including in my district, in the 
Sequoia National Forest. 
Last August, the SQF Complex fire 
burned over 170,000 acres, primarily in 
the Sequoia National Forest, after 
being ignited by lightning. A prelimi-
nary interagency report, led by the Na-
tional Park Service, estimates that 
this fire killed ‘‘10 to 14 percent of all 
large sequoias across the tree’s natural 
range in the Sierra Nevada. This trans-
lates to an estimated loss of 7,500 to 
10,600 large sequoias.’’ 
In modern history, we know of no 
other time to have this much devasta-
tion. In fact, the ninth largest giant se-
quoia, the King Arthur Tree, is still on 
fire to this day, almost one year later, 
and may ultimately die because of this 
fire. 
These losses are devastating, both 
environmentally, and for the commu-
nities. The giant sequoia and redwood 
capture more carbon than any other 
tree. 
But communities like Porterville, 
Three Rivers, Springville, Kernville, 
and Lake Isabella depend on the rev-
enue from tourists coming to see the 
giant sequoia groves. 
Following the fire, the U.S. Forest 
Service closed a large portion of the 
Sequoia National Forest in Tulare 
County because of public health and 
safety concerns, such as falling burned 
trees and mudslides. Addressing these 
safety concerns is critical so the forest 
can be fully reopened as quickly as pos-
sible. 
My amendment supports over $13 
million for three initiatives in the Se-
quoia National Forest. 
First, mitigating public safety haz-
ards so the burn area can be reopened 
to the public; 
Promoting ecological restoration ac-
tivities; and 
Supporting activities to reduce the 
risk of future catastrophic fires from 
killing additional giant sequoias. 
If you check, to this day, they be-
lieve there are only 5 percent of the 
giant sequoias on Earth still alive. 
I have spoken with the Sequoia Na-
tional Forest supervisor and have been 
assured that all of these actions are or 
will be reviewed under the National 
Environmental Policy Act and will be 
conducted consistent with the Giant 
Sequoia National Monument Manage-
ment Plan and the Sequoia National 
Forest Land and Resource Management 
Plan. 
These ancient giants, some of which 
are nearly 2,000 years old, must be pro-
tected so they can continue to inspire

and amaze future generations. Funding 
through my amendment would help en-
sure this so the public can once again 
see these breathtaking trees. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
GRANGER and Ranking Member JOYCE 
for their work to protect our natural 
resources. 
Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of 
my 
amendment 
to 
division 
F 
to 
prioritize funding for the VA’s Read-
justment Benefits account for the Vet-
eran Employment Through Technology 
Education Courses program, also called 
the VET TEC program, in fiscal year 
2022. 
I was very proud to introduce the 
original VET TEC Act back in 2017, 
after hearing that veterans could not 
utilize their GI Bill benefits for non-
traditional, technology-oriented nano-
degree courses. After speaking with 
veterans in my congressional district 
and across this country, it was appar-
ent there was significant demand from 
veterans interested in utilizing their 
GI Bill benefits for these types of class-
es. 
From these conversations, the VET 
TEC pilot program, which allows vet-
erans to apply for and enroll in non-
traditional, technology-oriented class-
es, was born. Now, over 2 years into the 
5-year VET TEC pilot program, I am 
proud to say over 3,000 veterans have 
participated in it, with 90 percent of 
these veterans graduating from these 
programs and 72 percent attaining em-
ployment in their chosen field of study. 
On average, graduates of the VET TEC 
program have an annual starting sal-
ary of over $59,000. That is approxi-
mately $25,000 more than the average 
salary in the United States. 
Since its launch in 2019, over 44,000 
veterans have applied to participate in 
the VET TEC pilot program. That is 
far outstripping current funding. These 
numbers paint a clear picture: VET 
TEC is a popular and a successful pro-
gram, and I believe that Congress 
should fund this program at its fully 
authorized level of $45 million in fiscal 
year 2022, which my amendment seeks 
to do. 
Even with this funding, the VA esti-
mates it will need $80 million more for 
this program to keep up with the cur-
rent demand. I look forward to working 
with my colleagues in the House to in-
crease the VET TEC program’s author-
ization in the future. 
Think about that, Mr. Speaker. Here 
are men and women who served their 
country that can use the GI Bill for 
nontraditional technology classes. In 
today’s world, that is the workforce we 
need. They jump ahead. They get paid 
more than the average American. But 
the desire and the need and the appli-
cations are much greater than we fund. 
I think we have a responsibility here. 
I want to thank House Veterans’ Af-
fairs 
Committee 
Ranking 
Member 
BOST, Congresswoman MILLER-MEEKS, 
and Congressman KHANNA for joining 
me in offering this amendment and for 
tirelessly advocating for the VET TEC 
program. 
I also want to thank Ranking Mem-
ber GRANGER
and Ranking Member 
CARTER for their work to support our 
Nation’s veterans. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today with a bipartisan 
amendment to protect our coast in 
Louisiana. 
I am proud to be joined by my fellow 
Louisianians in offering it today. They 
are joining me because this amend-
ment reflects one of the most impor-
tant tasks our State faces: restoring 
our coast. 
Put simply, if we don’t restore our 
coast, none of the other work that we 
do really matters. Our coast is sin-
gularly important to our culture, our 
food, our industry, and our way of life. 
We lose a significant amount of our 
coast to coastal erosion. We know that 
our fisheries and our fishermen depend 
on a robust coast. We know that by 
protecting it, we protect our economy 
and we protect those things that are 
critically important to the State of 
Louisiana. 
Our coast is not only an economic 
powerhouse 
and 
an 
environmental 
treasure, it is also physical safety of 
our neighbors, our neighborhoods, and 
our visitors. 
This amendment would make sure 
that we have the funding to continue 
using dredged materials to rebuild our 
coast. 
This beneficial use is one of the keys 
to creating our new wetlands and is a 
large part of our all-out effort to re-
store our coast by rebuilding and shor-
ing up our coast. 
I am proud to sponsor this funding, 
proud to have bipartisan support for it, 
and proud to ask that all Members join 
us in passing this incredible measure 
that is so important to Louisiana. This 
is not Republican nor Democrat, but it 
is good government. It is environ-
mentally sound, it is good for Lou-
isiana, and it is good for business. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Mrs. CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment, 
striking language that would effec-
tively allow unlimited use of addi-
tional contingency funding for SNAP. 
As I stated in my Rules testimony 
yesterday, when it comes to SNAP, 
this administration chose the playbook 
of the Center on Budget and Policy Pri-
orities to create a food stamp free-for- 
all. 
Recently, the CBPP wrote a piece 
that said: ‘‘For other appropriated en-
titlements, policymakers have a simple 
way to protect against inadequate an-
nual funding: by providing uncapped 
appropriations for the last quarter of 
the fiscal year to fulfill the require-
ments of the underlying law governing 
the program in question.’’ In other 
words, let’s hit continue on one of the 
biggest welfare expansions in U.S. his-
tory. 
The administration and the majority 
are taking the advice of a multi-mil-
lion-dollar organization and its leader-
ship that thrives on creating depend-
ency and making a lot of money by 
doing so. 
This 
slush 
fund 
of 
contingency 
money that I am talking about today 
has the potential to exceed $17 billion 
with unanticipated costs listed as the 
only parameter for spending. I can only 
guess what will, in fact, be labeled as 
an unanticipated cost. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor 
of my amendment, start supporting so-
lutions to end dependence, and help get 
people back to work. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify that if 
this amendment passes, it does not 
fund the specific project referred to by 
Mr. PFLUGER in debate. 
I support this general type of fund-
ing, and the text in the summary of the 
amendment are general, but the Com-
mittee on Appropriations has estab-
lished a process for consideration of a 
specific community project funding re-
quest. That process is designed to en-
sure transparency and accountability. 
The intention of this amendment, as 
explained by Mr. PFLUGER during de-
bate, appears to fund such a project 
without going through the vetting 
process. Accordingly, I would encour-
age my friend to submit the project to 
the Appropriations Committee under 
the established process next fiscal 
year. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak on my amendments 
to this legislation, which represent key 
central Virginia priorities as we re-
build from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I thank the chairwoman for her tre-
mendous work, and I look forward to 
moving forward with this legislation. 
My 340B-related amendment sends a 
message to big pharmaceutical compa-
nies: stop hiking drug prices on con-
sumers and discriminating against 340B 
providers and pharmacies. 
My amendment to boost funding for 
the Emergency Food Assistance Pro-
gram reflects the requests I have heard 
directly from central Virginia food 
banks, their staff, and their volunteers, 
as they fight hunger. 
My bipartisan amendment to in-
crease support for NRCS field staff 
would help crop and livestock pro-
ducers implement conservation prac-
tices that help their bottom lines. 
As we look to maintain telehealth 
services that expanded during the pan-
demic, my amendment to strengthen 
Federal funding for telehealth resource 
centers would directly benefit pro-
viders like the Karen S. Rheuban Cen-
ter for Telehealth at UVA, which 
serves so many of my constituents. 
Finally, my amendment to strength-
en ReConnect funding demonstrates 
our continued commitment as a Con-
gress and as a community to closing

the 
digital 
divide 
and 
expanding 
broadband internet access throughout 
our communities. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I am here 
today with the support of seven of my 
House 
colleagues 
to 
introduce 
an 
amendment to section B of H.R. 4502. 
This amendment will restore the 
principle of good governance, pre-
venting precious, hard-earned taxpayer 
dollars from going to the Civilian Cli-
mate Corps, which is an unauthorized 
program. 
As Members of the people’s House, we 
have an obligation to ensure taxpayer 
dollars are spent effectively and that 
spending is held to the highest stand-
ards of accountability. 
Yet, tucked away in the House Demo-
crats’ spending bill is funding for the 
so-called Civilian Climate Corps. The 
Democrats transferred $5 million, ini-
tially set aside for invasive species 
management, and directed it to this 
new program to fund bureaucrats. 
But there is a problem. The Biden ad-
ministration and Members of Congress 
have admitted they don’t know how 
the program will function. From what 
we know about this program, it will be 
a new massive Federal slush fund fo-
cused not on sound climate policy but 
on advancing the partisan Green New 
Deal agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, it is bad enough for gov-
ernment to fund a program that Con-
gress hasn’t authorized and can’t effec-
tively oversee. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BERA). The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from New York. 
b 1815 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, there are 
plenty of programs that are covered by 
this bill, including the 2018 farm bill 
with the mission and expertise to man-
age invasive species. The Civilian Cli-
mate Corps should be debated and con-
sidered in the House before it is funded; 
otherwise, this is just another bureau-
cratic slush fund. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in 
the House to support my commonsense 
amendment. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of my amendment to 
increase funding for the Adoption Op-
portunities Program in the fiscal year 
2022 Labor-HHS appropriations act. 
On any given day, 424,000 children are 
living in foster care in the United 
States, more than a quarter of whom 
are waiting to be adopted by a loving, 
supportive family. 
Unfortunately, 20,000 young people 
age-out of foster care each year with-
out a permanent family connection. 
How sad and tragic that is. That needs 
to change, and with the right support 
it can. 
The Adoption Opportunities Program 
provides a unique funding stream for 
States, counties, Tribes, and private 
organizations to invest in evidence- 
based solutions to find families for 
these youth and provide them with the 
support they need to thrive. 
From adoptive family recruitment to 
post-adoption services and caseworker 
training, these programs help foster 
youth build permanent family connec-
tions. 
Now is the time, Mr. Speaker, to in-
vest in solutions to improve permanent 
placements for foster youth. I thank 
Chairwoman DELAURO
and the com-
mittee for supporting this amendment 
and for her tremendous leadership in 
crafting 
this 
year’s 
appropriations 
bills. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the en bloc package and the 
underlying bill. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to ask support for en bloc No. 3 and 
these important amendments. Let me 
emphasize my first amendment, really, 
with a great deal of gratitude, because 
this is so very important. 
Human trafficking is a scourge on 
this Nation, and it has no boundaries; 
it is both domestic and international, 
but one of the things that is needed is 
for those who are trafficked, when they 
are found, to be able to cooperate with 
law enforcement. Many of those women 
are nondocumented immigrant women. 
My amendment says none of the 
funds made available by this act for do-
mestic food programs, Food and Nutri-
tion Service, Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program may be used in 
contravention of section 107(b) of Divi-
sion A of the Victims of Trafficking 
and Violence Protection Act of 2000. 
The effect of this amendment will be 
to make clear that nothing in this bill 
restricts the authority of the Secretary 
of Agriculture or any Federal agency 
head from providing assistance and 
benefits to victims of trafficking under 
current law so that they can engage 
with law enforcement and get the 
scourge, the person who trafficked, be-
cause they take advantage of these im-
migrants, and they cannot survive if 
they don’t have subsistence. Many 
times they are denied it, because we 
have not made it clear to the States 
they are allowed to have it. 
This amendment is going to save 
lives. I thank my colleagues for pro-
viding this particular amendment, and 
as well it is clear that it is needed, be-
cause it provides victims of trafficking 
access to information about their eligi-
bility to receive SNAP benefits. It does 
not constitute the type of SNAP re-
cruitment activity or advertising of 
the SNAP program prohibited by the 
bill, but more importantly, it helps 
those who are victims. 
Trafficking in humans, and espe-
cially domestic child trafficking, has 
no place in civilized society. It is the 
most lucrative business, better than 
drugs, and that is why it is—over and 
over again. 
Having held the first field hearing on 
human trafficking, I can tell you this 
is an important amendment. I ask my 
colleagues to support the Jackson Lee 
amendment and en bloc No. 3. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc 
Amendment No. 3 to Rules Committee Print 
117–12, which incorporates Jackson Lee 
Amendment No. 68. 
I thank the Rules Committee for making 
these amendments in order and Agriculture 
Appropriations Subcommittee Chair BISHOP for 
including it in this En Bloc Amendment. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #68 is simple and 
straightforward, but it makes an important con-
tribution to the bill and to a goal that every 
Member of this body shares—and that is end-
ing the scourge of human trafficking. 
My amendment provides that: 
None of the funds made available by this 
Act for ‘‘Domestic Food Programs—Food and 
Nutrition Service—Supplemental Nutrition As-
sistance Program’’ may be used in contraven-
tion of section 107(b) of Division A of the Vic-
tims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act 
of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7105(b)). 
The effect of this amendment will be to 
make clear that nothing in this bill restricts the 
authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or any 
federal agency head from providing assistance 
and benefits to victims of trafficking under cur-
rent law as authorized by 22 U.S.C. § 7105(b) 
of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Pro-
tection Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 1464, Pub. Law 
106–386). 
In particular, Jackson Lee Amendment #68 
is necessary to make clear that providing vic-
tims of trafficking access to information about 
their eligibility to receive SNAP benefits does 
not constitute the type of SNAP recruitment 
activities or ‘‘advertising’’ of the SNAP pro-
gram prohibited by the bill and by Section 
4018 of the Agriculture Act of 2014 (Public 
Law No: 113–079). 
Trafficking in humans, and especially do-
mestic child trafficking, has no place in a civ-
ilized society. Those who engage in this illicit 
trade should be prosecuted to the fullest ex-
tent of the law. This House made that clear 
again last month when it passed H.R. 3530, 
the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which 
contained my Sense of the Congress amend-
ment added during the Judiciary Committee 
markup. 
That means we need to ensure that state 
and local law enforcement agencies have the 
tools, resources, and training necessary to 
identify, apprehend, and prosecute criminals 
who ruthless traffic in children and young per-
sons. 
And one of the most effective resources in 
bringing criminals to justice is the cooperation 
and assistance of their victims. 
Perpetrators of crime know that they are 
more likely to evade detection and punishment 
when their victims refuse to assist or cooper-
ate with law enforcement. That is why they 
make it a point to instill fear in their victims— 
for their own safety or that of family and loved 
ones. 
I urge all Members to vote En Bloc Amend-
ment #3.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4070 
July 27, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I am 
ready to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port this amendment and hope that 
Members will vote for it. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port this amendment and urge Mem-
bers to pass it. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendments to H.R. 
4502, the Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Energy and Water Development, Financial 
Services and General Government, Interior, 
Environment, Military Construction, Veterans 
Affairs, Transportation, and Housing and 
Urban Development Appropriations Act of 
2022. 
These three amendments, included in en 
bloc three, support essential funding for our 
National Labs. The first amendment, which I 
introduced with Reps. WITTMAN, BEYER, LURIA, 
and WEXTON of Virginia; Reps. SUOZZI and 
RICE of New York; and Rep. SLOTKIN of Michi-
gan, highlights the need for funding for Me-
dium Energy Operations and Nuclear Physics 
within the Department of Energy’s Office of 
Science. The funding level included in the 
President’s Budget would advance our under-
standing of nuclear physics, study which en-
hances safety, quality of life, and even med-
ical care. Scientists and researchers at Thom-
as Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jef-
ferson Lab), located in the heart of my district 
in Newport News, train the next generation of 
scientists, advance lifesaving cancer radiation 
therapies, and have been awarded more than 
150 patents. Insufficient funding for Nuclear 
Physics and Medium Energy research would 
jeopardize Jefferson Lab’s run times, contrib-
uting to an increased backlog of experiments 
ultimately slowing innovation and decreasing 
the United States’ scientific achievements. 
Given the incredible work that Jefferson Lab 
does, I also submitted an amendment to en-
courage much needed investment in the Elec-
tron-Ion Collider, on which scientists at Jeffer-
son National Laboratory and Brookhaven Na-
tional Laboratory are collaborating. Again, the 
funding level included in the President’s Budg-
et Request is essential to moving this critical 
project forward. I thank my colleagues Reps. 
WITTMAN, BEYER, LURIA, WEXTON, SUOZZI, and 
RICE for their support of this effort. By sup-
porting the development of the Electron-Ion 
Collider, we enable researchers to answer 
pressing physics questions about the world in 
which we live. 
Lastly, I was pleased to see funding for the 
High Performance Data Facility to support 
real-time analysis for experiments across the 
National Laboratories included in the Presi-
dent’s Budget. The proposed facility would 
meet the needs of increasingly complex re-
search projects across the labs. Jefferson Lab, 
the first National Lab to deploy a graphics 
processing unit for scientific computing, is in-
credibly well-suited to house this facility on the 
East Coast. Establishing the facility at Jeffer-
son Lab would not only increase the National 
Laboratories’ computing capacity, it would also 
enhance their resilience and help Jefferson 
Lab achieve its vision for a diversified sci-
entific mission moving forward. I thank my col-
leagues Reps. WITTMAN, BEYER, LURIA, and 
WEXTON for their support of this amendment. 
These amendments, like the underlying bill, 
help us move forward, spurring innovation, 
creating jobs, facilitating incredible discovery. I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill and 
these amendments. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of En Bloc 3, which includes my amendment 
to the Labor-HHS-Education Division of H.R. 
4502, the minibus Appropriations Act. 
My amendment will provide an additional $2 
million to the Health Centers Program within 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices. This funding will provide increased as-
sistance to our community health centers 
which serve as a lifeline to many of the most 
vulnerable members of our community, and 
have been hit especially hard during the pan-
demic. 
Today there are around 1,400 health cen-
ters in over 14,000 urban and rural commu-
nities, across the U.S. serving 30 million pa-
tients in every state and territory. Even before 
the Covid–19 pandemic they provided vital 
comprehensive, quality health services—in-
cluding, primary and preventive care, behav-
ioral health, dental care, pharmacy, and vision 
care—to vulnerable and underserved commu-
nities. In recent years, they have been ex-
panding their services to include mental health 
and treatment of substance use disorder. 
Throughout the pandemic crisis, community 
health centers have stepped up to help their 
communities by providing essential testing, 
contact tracing, education, and vaccinations. 
And they have done so while continuing to 
meet the ongoing health care needs of their 
patients. However, these vital health care pro-
viders, who already operate on very tight 
budgets with thin margins, were stretched 
even thinner in the last eighteen months. At a 
time when they needed all hands on deck, 
community health centers around the country 
had to cut hours, reduce services, and lay off 
or furlough employees. Some even had to 
shut down temporarily. 
As we continue to work our way through to 
the other side of the pandemic, community 
health centers still need our support to care 
for our vulnerable and underserved Ameri-
cans. Thanks to the efforts of the Congress 
and the support of the President, our health 
centers have been given some of the assist-
ance they need in order to do so. Fortunately, 
the American Rescue Plan provided over $6.1 
billion in funding to 1,377 health centers 
around the country. In my state of Massachu-
setts, 37 community health centers have re-
ceived over $146 million to help them continue 
their work. 
I was pleased to see the substantial in-
crease that the Appropriations Committee pro-
vided to health centers in this spending bill, 
and again, I appreciate the Committee’s ac-
ceptance of my amendment which will help 
our community health centers to continue to 
provide quality, comprehensive health care to 
millions of Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this En Bloc 
amendment and the underlying bill. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my amendment to H.R. 4502, the con-
solidated appropriations legislation that will 
fund, among other Federal agencies, the De-
partment of Health and Human Services, in-
cluding the National Institutes of Health. 
This bill represents a strong investment in 
our national health care infrastructure, work-
force, and research and development enter-
prise—and I thank Chairwoman DELAURO for 
her strong leadership in ensuring that Con-
gress invests in the health of the American 
people as we continue to recover from the 
COVID–19 pandemic. However, the health 
care challenges are more diverse than 
COVID–19 alone and warrant our careful at-
tention and consideration. The historic invest-
ments in the National Institutes of Health, Na-
tional Cancer Institute, and other health agen-
cies are critical to addressing many of these 
health conditions and social issues. 
I offered my amendment to this bill to ad-
dress a critical gap in our fight to improve care 
for and save the lives of America’s most vul-
nerable children—pediatric brain cancer pa-
tients. We have invested in intensive clinical 
and biological research for years, including 
through the National Cancer Institute, to inves-
tigate the origins of and therapeutic options for 
pediatric cancers, but the mortality of children 
with brain cancer remains high and is the 
leading cause of pediatric cancer deaths. 
While brain tumors are rare in number 
among pediatric patients, the vulnerability of 
the patient population, combined with the 
array of tumor subtypes, makes investigating 
and treating this terrible condition a unique 
challenge for researchers. The National Can-
cer lnstitute’s Childhood Cancer Data Initiative 
is one effort to undertake the difficult work of 
collecting phenotypic and genotypic data for 
pediatric cancer patients to inform the biologic 
and molecular underpinnings of these rare 
cancers. 
I fully support this initiative—and my amend-
ment would strengthen its current work by di-
recting the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative to 
incorporate a key tool for researchers into its 
workflow—molecular tumor board data. Molec-
ular tumor boards use information from each 
patient’s tumor, including derived genotype 
and RNA and DNA profiling, and links re-
search to the clinical characteristics of the 
child, to inform treatment decisions. These 
data sets are a rich source of real-world infor-
mation that clinical scientists, treating physi-
cians, and families will be able to use in real 
time to make critical decisions on care. Over 
time, they will improve our understanding of 
pediatric cancers’ origins and functions and 
also assist in the development of new drugs, 
treatments, and potential cures. 
Specifically, my amendment provides $2 
million in further resources for the National 
Cancer Institute’s Childhood Cancer Data Ini-
tiative, which should be sufficient resources to 
incorporate data from the 2000 most highly 
malignant brain tumor cases that occur in 
American children each year. The Initiative is 
well positioned to incorporate molecular tumor 
board data from diverse patients across the 
country, to work with academic centers that 
have the expertise to review the data and sug-
gest treatment options, provide tumor board 
report information to patients and families, and 
to follow cases for clinical endpoints on a lon-
gitudinal basis. 
Mr. Speaker, America’s scientific and med-
ical 
communities 
lead 
the 
world 
in 
groundbreaking, lifesaving research, and this 
bill rightly invests in furthering that national in-
terest and strength. My amendment builds on 
this goal by centering research on some of the 
most vulnerable patients and some of the 
most unique and deadly health conditions that 
affect America’s children. These tumors and 
cancers need innovative strategies to improve

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentleman from 
Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, my amend-
ment defends religious organizations 
under attack from the radical left. 
Democrat politicians’ distrust of reli-
gious entities does not entitle them to 
ban them unconstitutionally from par-
ticipating in Federal programs and 
contracts. 
President Biden and other Democrat 
politicians continue to target faith- 
based entities despite repeated rebuke 
from the U.S. Supreme Court. Demo-
crats’ unfounded fear of religious Fed-
eral contractors is, in fact, a form of 
discrimination. 
Religious 
organiza-
tions that contract with the Federal 
Government must still abide by non-
discrimination laws. 
We must protect the valuable Depart-
ment of Labor regulation that provides 
certainty and predictability for Fed-
eral contractors and upholds the rights 
of all Americans. 
Religious freedom is a nonnegotiable 
right. My amendment upholds the Con-
stitution and supports the right of reli-
gious organizations to do business with 
the Federal Government. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on Foxx amendment 16. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
While I have offered this en bloc 
amendment for the purposes of legisla-
tive efficiency, I strongly oppose it. 
The en bloc makes severe harmful 
changes to the bills under consider-
ation. 
Within the Labor-HHS-Education di-
vision, the amendment would support 
discrimination, it would attack work-
ers’ rights, cut money from education, 
put affordable child care further out of 
reach for families. 
The amendment strikes a general 
provision from the bill that prohibits 
funding to organizations that do not 
follow the Federal regulation that pro-
hibits discrimination on the basis of 
age, disability, sex, race, color, na-
tional origin, religion, gender identity, 
or sexual orientation. 
Under the previous administration, 
HHS used taxpayer dollars to fund 
child welfare organizations that were 
willing to discriminate against fami-
lies. 
The United States has over 400,000 
children in foster care, over 125,000 of 
whom are waiting to be adopted. Chil-
dren in foster care need and deserve 
every chance to be placed in loving 
homes. 
America’s workers, this amendment 
prohibits the Department of Labor 
from revising the previous administra-
tion’s antiworker rule, granting tax-
payer-funded contractors the extraor-
dinary power to hire and fire employ-
ees based on religious beliefs. The rule 
weakens antibias protections for work-
ers by shielding Federal contractors 
from complying with workplace anti-
discrimination laws. 
The 
amendment 
undermines 
the 
highly successful registered appren-
ticeship grant program by wasting tax-
payer funds on low-quality, predatory 
programs with no accountability. 
At a time when quality, affordable 
education is more important than ever, 
this amendment cuts $122 million from 
the higher education account and the 
underlying bill. The amendment takes 
money away from Hispanic-serving in-
stitutions, historically Black colleges 
and universities, Tribal colleges and 
universities, Asian-American and Na-
tive-American Pacific Islander-serving 
institutions, and other minority-serv-
ing institutions. 
Finally, 
as 
our 
Nation 
faces 
a 
childcare crisis, the amendment re-
duces childcare options for student par-
ents who rely on university childcare 
programs supported by the Childcare 
Access Means Parents in Schools Pro-
gram. 
Harmful 
changes. 
This 
barely 
scratches the surface of funding cuts 
and harmful policy provisions espoused 
in this amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this en bloc. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment 
that is included in this en bloc. My 
amendment strikes section 241, which 
requires foster care and adoption agen-
cies to comply with Obama-era regula-
tions on sexual orientation and gender 
identity and prohibits the use of funds 
to grant exceptions. 
Section 241 is an attack on religious 
liberty. Similar provisions allowed the 
city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to 
refuse a contract with Catholic Social 
Services unless they certified same-sex 
couples as foster parents. 
My amendment ensures that faith- 
based adoption and foster care agencies 
do not have to choose between their 
ministry and their faith. It is tyran-
nical for the government to force these 
entities to choose between the two. 
It is our job in Congress to uphold 
our constitutional right of religious 
freedom. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port my amendment. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. SCHRADER). 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of my 
amendment to ask the FDA to move 
forward 
with 
rulemaking 
on 
cannabidiol. Despite the 2018 farm bill 
being 
signed 
into 
law 
legalizing 
cannabidiol, hemp farmers, including 
those in my home State of Oregon, 
have faced economic burdens from the 
regulatory uncertainty by lack of ac-
tion. 
We have legalized the sale of hemp 
derivatives like CBD, but the market-
place adoption has not taken off like 
Congress and hemp farmers alike ex-
pected. Lack of clarity in legal pur-
chasing of CBD is a big part of the 
problem.

July 27, 2021 
The FDA has the authority to con-
duct the necessary rulemaking to es-
tablish a regulatory pathway for CBD 
as a dietary supplement and food ingre-
dient. 
This amendment, with my colleague 
Representative GRIFFITH, calls on the 
FDA to proceed in doing so, as the live-
lihoods of hemp farmers and safety of 
consumers across the country reside in 
the hands of the agency. There is no 
reason for the FDA not to be moving 
forward since the 2018 farm bill. 
To that end, I have also introduced 
with Representative GRIFFITH H.R. 841 
on a bipartisan basis. My bill will re-
quire the FDA to do what they have 
the authority to do and should have 
done already to craft the necessary 
rules and guidance to regulate CBD as 
a dietary supplement. 
No regulatory system is perfect, but 
congressional intent has been clear on 
hemp and CBD. The livelihoods of the 
farmers and agriculture jobs hang in 
the balance. It is long past time the 
FDA and Congress move forward with 
making CBD legal and safe for con-
sumers. 
b 1830 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port this amendment, and I encourage 
my colleagues to support it also. I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, for the 
reasons I spoke of earlier, I urge a de-
feat of this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak on my amendment, No. 89, drawing at-
tention to the lack of funding for the Uranium 
Reserve Program in this bill. I would like to 
thank the Rules committee for making this 
amendment in order, although I was dis-
appointed that many other crucial amend-
ments I supported will not be debated or voted 
on by the full House, including many that 
would have preserved the protections for un-
born lives that have been included in every 
other appropriations bill in recent memory. 
The Department of Energy’s Uranium Re-
serve Program is critical to both our energy in-
dustry and national security. In the Fiscal Year 
21 appropriations, this program was funded at 
75 million dollars, but it was not included this 
year at all. This program will play an important 
role in reviving domestic uranium production 
and will bring new jobs to states like Wyo-
ming. Uranium, despite what this administra-
tion may believe, is a critical mineral that is 
essential to our energy security, armed forces, 
and strategic deterrence. 
The Uranium Reserve Program was de-
signed to address identified risks to the unobli-
gated uranium supply chain including the loss 
of domestic uranium mining and enrichment 
capabilities, and defunding it will only serve to 
make the United States more dependent on 
unreliable foreign sources owned by China 
and Russia. This is not the time to expand our 
reliance on these countries. Instead of stifling 
domestic production of uranium, we should be 
expanding it. 
I hope the Chair and Ranking Member will 
work with me, moving forward, to ensure this 
important program receives adequate funding. 
I hope eliminating the Uranium Reserve Pro-
gram from this year’s Energy and Water ap-
propriations was simply an oversight and the 
result of a rushed, partisan process, and that 
this can be remedied before the September 30 
deadline. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the pre-
vious 
question 
is

gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. 
DELAURO). 
The question is on the amendments

Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays.

AMENDMENT NO. 29 OFFERED BY MRS. LESKO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 29 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
109. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Strike section 316 of division A. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the gen-
tlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Arizona. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
My amendment strikes section 316. 
Under current law, universities are 
already allowed to conduct research on 
marijuana as long as the university 
gets approval from the Drug Enforce-
ment Agency and buys the marijuana 
from the University of Mississippi, the 
DEA’s approved provider. 
Additionally, universities are cur-
rently required to comply with the 
Drug-Free Schools and Communities 
Act which prohibits universities from 
unlawfully manufacturing, distributing 
and dispensing, or possessing a con-
trolled substance. A violation of this 
law would result in a loss of Federal 
funding. 
Democrats want to change all of this. 
Section 316 allows universities to skirt 
these requirements. 
If universities are allowed to engage 
in cannabis growing and research with-
out any safeguards, who is to say that 
this provision would not permit univer-
sities to offer a class called Pot Smok-
ing 101, dedicated to smoking pot under 
the false pretense of research. 
Pushing for marijuana research in 
universities also fails to account for 
the fact that because marijuana is a 
schedule I drug, Federal law requires 
certain safeguards, including a limited- 
access room and a specific storage safe 
for the drug. 
My amendment allows for the with-
holding of Federal funds if universities 
fail to implement these necessary safe-
guards. An appropriations package is, 
quite simply, not the place for debate 
on a legalization of or looser restric-
tions for marijuana. 
My colleagues across the aisle are 
using this partisan package as a round-
about way of legalizing marijuana 
without having any meaningful debate 
about its classification as a schedule I 
drug or the effects that the drug has on 
Americans’ health. 
This appropriations package should 
not be an opportunity to push an agen-
da without meaningful debate about 
the consequences of legalizing a sched-
ule I drug. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Connecticut is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, through 
scientific 
research, 
institutions 
of 
higher education advance our under-
standing, advance our knowledge of 
various aspects of our world, expands 
our knowledge. Without such research, 
there would be limited scientific dis-
covery and breakthroughs helping to 
shape our daily lives. 
As more States and localities move 
to legalize cannabis, including my 
home State of Connecticut earlier this 
month, many institutions of higher 
education are expanding the knowledge 
base on this controlled substance, of-
fering scientific information to better 
inform decisionmaking and medical 
use. 
What are its properties for medical 
use? I don’t know. I am not a scientist. 
I am not a medical professional. That 
is what science is about, to expand our 
minds, to give us information about 
what directions we ought to take. 
In advancing our understanding of 
cannabis, many institutions fear that 
they will lose access to Federal funding 
because of the Drug-Free Schools and 
Communities Act, which, in part, pro-
hibits the possession of a controlled 
substance, including cannabis. 
The underlying bill includes a provi-
sion to prohibit the Department of 
Education from penalizing institutions 
of higher education that conduct sci-
entific research on marijuana. Evi-
dence-based research regarding can-
nabis ought to be encouraged in aca-
demic settings, not discouraged. We 
should ensure that we broaden our un-
derstanding of marijuana, not limit it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, univer-
sities are already allowed to do re-
search on marijuana as long as they 
follow DEA and other safety guide-
lines. 
The problem with inserting section 
316 is it takes away those safeguards,

so I would say that there should be no 
concern that my amendment will stop 
research in universities. 
In fact, universities are allowed to do 
it now and will continue to do it, even 
if my amendment passes. It just is the 
case that right now, there are safe-
guards. There has to be safeguards 
around a schedule I drug, and if this 
bill, without my amendment, is passed, 
the safeguards will be gone and that is 
the problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I oppose 
the amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment which strikes 
language that allows funds to go to univer-
sities researching cannabis. We should not be 
afraid of data and research. As Co-Chair of 
the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, we 
should be encouraging expanding our knowl-
edge—not limiting it. 
Politicians should not be stifling academic 
freedom. 
I am proud to represent California-13 which 
includes some of the best research institutes 
in the country, UC Berkeley and Lawrence 
Berkeley Labs. None of us should want to 
withhold funds from our institutions and con-
stituents because a university wants to do sci-
entific research on a plant. UC Berkeley has 
one of the only cannabis research centers in 
the country and these prohibitions just tie the 
hands of our professors, researchers, and stu-
dents by imposing restrictions on funding and 
essentially silencing them. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no against this 
anti-science amendment and to vote no 
against academic freedom.

AMENDMENT NO. 36 OFFERED BY MS. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 36 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
109. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 187, lines 11 through 22, strike section 
507 of division A. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
present this amendment at the desk 
today because for a very long period of 
time, the United States has and con-
tinues to uphold obsolete and old provi-
sions from the war on drugs. 
This provision specifically has, for a 
very long period of time, prevented and 
acted as a barricade to Federal re-
search on certain substances—such as 
psilocybin, MDMA, and marijuana—in 
allowing us to research the applica-
tions and potential therapeutic appli-
cations of these drugs in the treatment 
of diseases such as PTSD, addiction, 
and depression. 
We are long overdue and in a moment 
of reckoning to make sure that we not 
only rectify the harms from the past 
but allow us to research the potential 
medicinal applications of these sub-
stances. The first step in doing that is 
ending and taking down some of these 
old provisional barriers to research. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Michigan is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
We all know mental health is a major 
problem in our country. According to 
the National Institutes of Health, ap-
proximately 50 million Americans from 
all walks of life suffer from a mental 
health issue. 
One such population extremely close 
to my heart is veterans. With around 20 
veteran and servicemember suicides 
per day, I consider one death to be too 
many. The amendment before us, how-
ever, is trying to solve a problem that, 
frankly, just doesn’t exist. 
There is plenty of research already 
being conducted featuring the use of 
schedule I drugs to treat mental illness 
and addiction. The amendment will do 
nothing to change this, despite its 
claims to the contrary. 
What the amendment will actually 
do is repeal an existing provision that 
limits the use of funds to promote le-
galization of schedule I drugs. The 
amendment also repeals a provision 
that specifically allows Federal funds 
to be used to research the therapeutic 
uses of these substances. 
The stated purpose of this amend-
ment, which is to support this research 
on behalf of those who suffer from crit-
ical diseases, is contradictory to the 
actual effect. Therefore, because of the 
disingenuous nature and intent of this 
amendment, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
b 1845 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, 
briefly, I think one of the things that 
is important to acknowledge is that to 
have such a broad and vague provision 
in what qualifies as promotion, it in-
cludes research and, one could argue, 
primarily affects scientific research to 
prevent us from actually having the 
evidence to assess these substances for 
what they are. 
Currently, much of the research that 
is being conducted right now is reliant 
on private funding, or the stigma and 
fear and the chilling effect associated 
with having these provisions on the 
books, which are largely unnecessary, 
prevents such critical research from 
being funded. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CORREA), my colleague. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise 
in strong support of this measure, and 
I also have the veterans very near and 
dear to my heart. 
Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago, I started 
my quest to help veterans deal with 
those invisible wounds that they bring 
back from the battlefield, PTSD and 
other mental issues that they bring 
back with them and carry with them 
on a day-to-day basis. 
As the chair of the California Com-
mittee on Veteran Affairs, I held hear-
ings. I kept getting veterans saying: 
We prefer cannabis to opioid medica-
tion. We want the VA to give us can-
nabis. We don’t want opioids. 
I soon discovered that there was no 
medical research anywhere to deter-
mine what cannabis was good for and 
what it was not good for. 
Today, as a Member of Congress, I 
have attempted to pass legislation year 
after year mandating that the VA do 
research, conduct research into the 
medical benefits of cannabis, and we 
scored zero. 
This amendment is simple. It is 
about saying let’s do medical research 
into the benefits of cannabis and other 
drugs that our veterans are taking that 
they say are good for them. Let’s not 
take away from our veterans the abil-
ity to have the medications they pre-
fer. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
measure. Let’s do it for our veterans. 
Let’s do it for their welfare. Let’s do it 
for scientific research. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
please support this measure. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion 
and the articulate response of my col-
league. I have had the honor to serve 
with him, and we agree on the vulnera-
bility of veterans. In fact, a year-plus 
ago, we tried to move the IMPROVE 
Act through the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs to try to look at dif-
ferent ways to provide opportunities to 
bring veterans into the VA healthcare 
system so we could identify them and 
treat their addiction. It wasn’t nec-
essarily about the research of the prod-
uct. It was the research of the veteran 
as a whole, the veteran’s vulnerability. 
Mr. Speaker, it was painful in the 
committee setting to have the IM-
PROVE Act disapproved when, at the 
same time, that same committee au-
thorized equine therapy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4075 
July 27, 2021 
As Dr. Phil Roe said at the time, this 
a first for the Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs. We have not allowed people to 
treat veterans, but we are allowing 
horses to treat veterans. 
The point is, we are looking to do 
something here via this amendment 
that does not solve an existing prob-
lem. We need to have the outreach, the 
research, but we also need to have the 
human side to make sure that we con-
nect all the dots for the betterment of 
the veterans’ mental health. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, with acknowledgment 
of that point, I think many of us have 
a shared outcome and a shared goal 
here, which is to help people who are 
hurting. 
Right now, more than 40,000 people 
die in the United States of opioid 
overdoses annually. At least one in two 
PTSD patients cannot tolerate or do 
not respond adequately to existing 
treatment. We have promising indica-
tions that certain drugs that, frankly, 
are unjustly, in my opinion, placed on 
a schedule I list have promising out-
comes for people who are suffering 
from PTSD, including our veterans. 
We have to have the research in order 
to develop these holistic, whole person 
treatments. That research deserves to 
be in the realm of the public. That re-
search deserves to be eligible for public 
funding. A blanket, vague ban that was 
borne out of fear and the paranoia of 
the war on drugs should not be defining 
the limits of our ability to act respon-
sibly today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
amendment before us, as it has been 
presented, is trying to solve a problem 
that doesn’t exist, as stated. There is 
ample research already being con-
ducted featuring the use of schedule I 
drugs to treat mental illness and addic-
tion. The amendment, as presented, 
will do nothing to change this, despite 
the claims to the contrary. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
not support or, said a different way, to 
oppose the amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, 
to that point, I believe that this prob-
lem does very much exist. Much of the 
research that is being conducted today 
must rely on private funding, and we 
cannot allow for that to be limited in 
its scope. 
If we only allow corporations or if we 
only allow well-moneyed interests and 
wealthy interests to have a monopoly 
on the ability to research these drugs, 
we are not acting and really fully using 
the resources of the public in order to 
determine the full benefits that could 
be possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, as a 
veteran and one who served the coun-
try for 40-plus years in uniform, the 
bond we have as veterans goes deeper 
than anyone could imagine. The worst 
thing that can happen, as has happened 
in my family, is to have a loved one 
and a veteran take their own life. I 
have decades, unfortunately, of family 
experience in this. Because of that, my 
passion for stating opposition to this 
amendment goes unabated. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 555, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
amendments are modified. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the 
House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut for 
yielding. I am just in awe of her vir-
tuoso presentation of this legislation 
for the people. 
I thank the chairwoman for the mas-
tery of the subject matter, for the stra-
tegic plan that she had to bring it to 
the floor, for her collaboration with 
her subcommittee chairs as well as the 
chairs of the subcommittees of author-
ization. I congratulate and thank her. I 
thank her for the children. 
Mr. Speaker, this package puts work-
ing families first. It does so by 
prioritizing jobs, laying the foundation 
to create hundreds of thousands of 
good-paying jobs, including by rebuild-
ing the infrastructure, including sur-
face transportation and water infra-
structure to get the lead out; advanc-
ing the clean energy economy of the fu-
ture; and launching workforce training 
for the 21st century. And it puts work-
ing families first by investing in our 
children. 
Again and again, when people ask me 
what the three most important issues 
facing the Congress are, I always say 
the same thing, our children, our chil-
dren, our children, and their health; 
their education; the economic security 
of their families; a clean, safe environ-
ment in which they can thrive; a world 
at peace in which they can reach their 
fulfillment. 
This legislation addresses many of 
these priorities. 
Mr. Speaker, children’s health is pro-
tected with child nutrition initiatives, 
including SNAP and WIC, serving tens 
of millions of hungry kids. 
b 1900 
I remember when the stories were 
written about the first community 
health centers, the person who was the 
leader in all of that was spending some 
health money on food, and the Federal 
Government said: That is supposed to 
be for prescription drugs and not for 
food. 
He responded: Food is what makes 
our children healthy. 
So I thank the gentlewoman for the 
nutrition sections in here. 
The health of the family is also pro-
tected by support for public health ini-
tiatives for maternal and child health, 
as well as research to fight future 
pandemics and to head off future 
pandemics. 
Our children’s education is advanced 
by ensuring that K–12 schools have re-
sources they need, including with his-
toric investments in title 1, and higher 
education is advanced in Pell grants 
and other financial assistance and 
funding for minority-serving institu-
tions, our HBCUs, our Hispanic-serving 
institutions, and our institutions that 
help our Native-American institutions 
of higher learning. 
I think it is really important to 
note—and I thank the chairwoman for 
recognizing this—that when we talk 
about the investments we make in an 
appropriations bill, it is important to 
note that this is not increasing the na-
tional debt—nothing. 
Mr. Speaker, economists will tell you 
nothing brings more money to the 
Treasury than the education of the 
American people. Earliest childhood, 
K–12, higher ed, post-grad, lifetime 
learning 
for 
our 
workers—nothing 
brings more money. So I thank the 
gentlewoman for this fiscally respon-
sible initiative. 
In terms of the economic security of 
our children and families, these bills 
make strong investments in rental, 
homeowner, and other housing initia-
tives, 
including 
low-income 
house-
holds, and in combating homelessness, 
and they address economic disparities 
facing families. 
Indeed, this appropriation package 
puts justice and equity front and cen-
ter. We are proud of its provisions to 
combat injustice and economic oppor-
tunities, pollution and the environ-
ment, health and more. 
This package is also about our chil-
dren’s future in another respect. It con-
fronts the climate crisis by expanding 
environmental 
enforcement 
efforts, 
creating a Civilian Climate Corps and 
launching a renewed focus on pro-
tecting our cherished scenic places and 
expanding local parks in communities 
across the country for our families to 
enjoy. It sets us on a course for an af-
fordable, secure, and clean energy fu-
ture by investing over $14 billion in 
clean energy and science which will 
also create thousands of green jobs. 
Also, so importantly, this package 
honors our responsibility to our vet-
erans, their families, and their care-
givers. These bills contain robust fund-
ing for veterans’ healthcare including 
women’s 
health, 
women 
veterans’ 
health, mental health, and homeless-
ness assistance. It will help veterans 
transition to civilian life with eco-
nomic opportunities worthy of their 
service. 
We always say that we owe so much 
to our men and women in uniform and 
to our veterans. We owe them so much 
to meet their needs, but we also owe 
them a debt of gratitude by building a 
future worthy of their sacrifice. This 
bill also builds vital military infra-
structure, including military housing, 
childcare centers, and VA facilities. 
This week, as we advance these ap-
propriations bills, Congress will con-
tinue our work to advance infrastruc-
ture and budget reconciliation bills 
that meet the needs of the American 
people separate from the appropria-
tions bills. In all that we do, Demo-
crats are for the people and building 
back better by investing in America 
with jobs, opportunity, and progress 
for families. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote for 
this important and impactful appro-
priations bill of which the Congress 
and the country can all be proud with 
great gratitude to Madam Chair, Con-
gresswoman DELAURO, for her leader-
ship and all the members of her team. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) 
for a unanimous consent request. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent to include the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. JACKSON). 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment to 
H.R. 4502, which would block the IRS 
from targeting people or groups based 
on their political beliefs. 
Unelected bureaucrats at the IRS 
have a history of weaponizing their 
power to go after conservatives. Mr. 
Speaker, you may recall the Lois 
Lerner scandal that happened during 
the Obama-Biden administration. In 
that case, the IRS targeted conserv-
ative groups by subjecting their appli-
cation for tax-exempt status to in-
creased and unnecessary scrutiny, ef-
fectively trying to silence their polit-
ical beliefs. 
Now, as President Biden, Joe Biden, 
has made it clear, his administration 
will weaponize big tech to go after con-
servatives, too. There is a trend here, 
and Congress must act. People and or-
ganizations should not be silenced be-
cause of their political beliefs. 
If it can happen to conservatives, 
then it can happen to liberals too, so 
every Member in this body has a duty 
to protect their constituents from po-
tential IRS abuse. My amendment 
would help make sure things like the 
Lois Lerner scandal never happen 
again at the IRS.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4078 
July 27, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in voting for this commonsense 
amendment. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 45 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, the amendments en bloc 
includes a number of proposals offered 
by Members on both sides of the aisle. 
It includes amendments offered by 
Democrats and Republicans, and sev-
eral offered jointly by Members of both 
parties on which the vast majority of 
this body can agree. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bipartisan amendments en bloc, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
my amendment No. 151, which seeks to 
provide an additional $650,000 to the 
U.S. Geological Survey to accelerate 
updating the seismic hazard model for 
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands. The corresponding offset would 
come from a small portion of the in-
crease to transition the U.S. Geological 
Survey fleet to zero emission vehicles, 
which falls under the same account. 
The National Seismic Hazard Model 
describes the potential impacts of 
earthquakes nationwide and serves as 
the basis for seismic provisions in 
building codes. While the U.S. Geologi-
cal Survey office last updated the 
model for the 48 contiguous States in 
2018, it has not updated the models for 
Alaska since 2007, for Hawaii since 1998, 
and for Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Is-
lands since 2003. 
The 
U.S. 
Geological 
Survey 
has 
begun updating the models for Alaska 
and Hawaii, which will be released with 
the next update of the National Seis-
mic Hazard Model in 2023. Unfortu-
nately, there is not enough time to up-
date the models for Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. That is the 
reason this amendment will provide 
the initial funds needed to permit the 
U.S. Geological Survey to complete 
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands update within 3 years, by 2024. 
In Puerto Rico we know firsthand the 
devastating impact earthquakes can 
have, as we saw last year in the south-
ern part of the island where most of 
the schools were destroyed as well as 
infrastructure. Updating the hazard 
model is, therefore, urgent and crucial 
to saving lives and ensuring that we 
have the necessary tools to prepare for 
future seismic events. 
Mr. Speaker, that is the reason I urge 
my colleagues to support the amend-
ment. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. 
LANGEVIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the en bloc package which includes 
my amendment, Langevin No. 129, to 
the Financial Services and General 
Government Division. 
I would like to begin by thanking 
Chairman 
QUIGLEY
of 
that 
sub-
committee for his support of the 
amendment and my good friend and fel-
low 
Cyberspace 
Solarium 
Commis-
sioner, Congressman MIKE GALLAGHER, 
for cosponsoring the amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a simple amend-
ment. It increases funding for the Of-
fice of the National Cyber Director to 
$25 million, the full amount rec-
ommended by the Cyberspace Solarium 
Commission which was created in last 
year’s NDAA. Its charge was to create 
an overarching strategy to better pro-
tect 
the 
United 
States 
against 
cyberattacks 
of 
significant 
con-
sequence. 
Creating the position of the National 
Cyber Director has been a passion of 
mine for more than a decade. It finally 
happened last year, and I have long ar-
gued that we need a head coach to co-
ordinate all of the various cyber play-
ers in the Federal Government, and the 
NCD does just that. 
Chris Inglis, who started earlier this 
month, is the Nation’s first Senate- 
confirmed National Cyber Director, 
and he is exactly the right person to 
ensure that we effectively implement a 
national cyber strategy to protect us 
from the ever-growing threats that we 
face in cyberspace. 
But, Mr. Speaker, he can’t do his job 
without an office to support him. So 
this amendment will ensure that Direc-
tor Inglis has the staff he needs to ful-
fill his statutory obligations to review 
agency cyber budgets, lead the develop-
ment of cybersecurity policy, and co-
ordinate incident response. 
So I appreciate, again, the support of 
Chairman QUIGLEY and the overall Ap-
propriations Committee led by Con-
gresswoman ROSA DELAURO. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an important 
amendment, and I urge my colleagues 
to support the amendments en bloc and 
the underlying bill. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Hawaii 
(Mr. KAHELE). 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, first, I 
thank the appropriations chair, Ms. 
DELAURO, 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER for their leadership in bring-
ing these appropriations bills to the 
floor. 
I rise before you today, Mr. Speaker, 
to speak on behalf of my bipartisan 
amendment co-led by Representatives 
FERGUSON, DAVIS, FITZPATRICK, and 
BERGMAN. 
For the last 10 years, some foreign 
airlines have sought to undermine 
international standards, the rights of 
U.S. workers, and to erode the com-
petitiveness of our U.S. domestic air-
lines. These foreign airlines are un-
fairly using atypical business practices 
to register their airline away from its 
home country in more convenient loca-
tions to find countries with more per-
missive legal, regulatory, labor, and 
safety standards which creates a seri-
ous disadvantage for our U.S. workers 
and carriers, as well as undermines the 
safety standards the U.S. has worked 
so hard to cultivate. 
Commercial 
aviation 
contributes 
over 5 percent to the U.S. GDP and sup-
ports hundreds of thousands of good– 
paying jobs. My bipartisan amendment 
seeks to prevent flags of convenience 
airlines from undercutting U.S. jobs by 
ensuring that no Federal funds can be 
used to approve a new foreign air car-
rier permit unless certain conditions 
are met, including evaluating if it is in 
the best public interest. 
This commonsense amendment, Mr. 
Speaker, will enable the Department of 
Transportation to prevent foreign air-
lines that use atypical or flags of con-
venience business models from flying 
to and from the United States which 
will support American jobs, American 
workers, and the U.S. airline industry. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chair of the Appropriations Com-
mittee whom I deeply adore. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
amendment which highlights the De-
fense Department’s abject failure to 
maintain its child development centers 
and its barracks and the need for a $15 
billion investment. 
Our associates in the department and 
the generals all talk about how impor-
tant it is to take care of the whole 
servicemember. I always say that when 
a servicemember serves, so does his or 
her family. 
Now, we know by their own admis-
sion that there are 135 childcare cen-
ters that are in either poor or failing 
condition, and we have more than 9,000 
families with children on waiting lists 
in the military. 
But having all that knowledge, Mr. 
Speaker, you would think that they 
would elevate this issue. But only one 
childcare center has been considered in 
their budget request. There are 135 that 
are poor or failing, and they chose to 
only fund one. 
While the Army announced with 
great fanfare some time ago a $10 bil-
lion, 10-year project to replace sub-
standard barracks, that would require 
$1 billion a year in which they would 
invest in barracks, but they have only 
committed and requested $262 million— 
they are clearly, not on track to com-
plete this $10 billion project over 10 
years. 
b 1915 
I thank the Appropriations Com-
mittee for adding $300 million for bar-
racks and child care centers over the 
Department’s request, but this does 
not excuse the military from its re-
sponsible. Talk is cheap. Action is 
what we want to see. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on the Depart-
ment to do a better job in the next 
year’s budget. I urge my colleagues to

July 27, 2021 
include $15 billion for these quality of 
life matters for our military families 
in 
the 
forthcoming 
reconciliation 
package. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, wildfires 
in Washington State have been increas-
ing in intensity and scale every year 
for the past few years, and our State 
and local fire departments are being 
called to respond like never before. 
Last year, Kittitas County, a county 
in my district, worked together with a 
neighboring district, closely together, 
to put out the Evans Creek fire. And 
both counties joined forces, they pre-
vented tremendous damage, stopped 
the fire. 
However, only one county received 
Federal reimbursement money to help 
them pay the expenses; the other one is 
now left almost destitute having blown 
out their budget. So the money fol-
lowed the county lines, not the fire 
lines. 
So 
my 
amendment ensures that 
small municipalities can get Federal 
reimbursement funds after fighting 
wildfires, regardless of where those 
county lines are. It will direct the 
Wildland Fire Leadership Council to 
provide recommendations on address-
ing interjurisdictional fire reimburse-
ment challenges like this one and pro-
vide some clarity. 
As we face increasingly catastrophic 
wildfire seasons each year, stepping up 
to help a neighboring county should be 
encouraged. And a fairer distribution 
of Federal reimbursement distribution 
dollars would do just that. 
This is a commonsense amendment, 
and I urge my colleagues to support its 
adoption. 
For months, exporters in my district 
have struggled to get their crops over-
seas because foreign-owned carriers are 
taking empty containers back to China 
rather than waiting for our growers to 
load their crops. This is threatening 
decades-long trade relationships across 
the Pacific. 
These large multination corporations 
control all overseas transportation, 
and exporters really have no power. My 
amendment directs the Federal Mari-
time Commission to enhance assist-
ance to U.S. exporters and importers 
both informally and affordably and 
without the need to hire lawyers. 
Getting U.S. goods to market in a 
timely fashion can affect the success of 
an entire growing season for farmers 
and for producers. This issue affects 
not just Washington State, it affects 
farmers across the country and the 
lack of shipping container availability 
is an issue at all U.S. ports. 
It is time to give exporters more sup-
port to ensure their goods can get to 
market in time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, we sup-
port the amendment and would encour-
age our colleagues to vote for it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just say I support the amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of my bipartisan amendment to Division E 
of H.R. 4502, offered with Congressmen GUY 
RESCHENTHALER
and VINCENTE
GONZALEZ, 
number 183 and part of en bloc package num-
ber five, which would increase funds for the 
United States Geological Survey (USGS) by 
$2,000,000 and decrease funding for the Sec-
retary of the Interior, Departmental Operations, 
by the same amount. 
Since my first term in Congress I have 
worked diligently to decrease our reliance on 
foreign sources of elements and minerals crit-
ical for certain energy applications. These ma-
terials are especially important for our clean 
energy future, used in products like electric 
vehicles and wind turbines among many oth-
ers. Legislation I introduced on this subject, 
the Securing Energy Critical Elements and 
American Jobs Act, was the basis for a robust 
domestic research and development program 
on energy critical materials signed into law as 
Sections 7001 and 7002 of the Energy Act of 
2020 (Division Z of the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260)). 
Sections 7001 and 7002 authorize a total of 
$208 million for this program in fiscal year 
2022. Of that, $158 million is for Department 
of Energy (DOE) work. I want to thank the En-
ergy and Water and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Subcommittee for providing the need-
ed funds and for citing to Sections 7001 and 
7002 of the Energy Act of 2020 in its com-
mittee report when describing what DOE is to 
do in this area. 
The remainder, $50 million, essentially is for 
activities to be undertaken by or with the De-
partment of Interior or USGS, and those activi-
ties are the subject of my amendment. I ap-
preciate that the report from the Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies Appropriations 
Subcommittee references and directs funds to 
some work on critical minerals. However, it 
does not refer to specifically to Section 7002 
of the Energy Act of 2020 or mention all as-
pects of the program that section of law cre-
ates. 
My amendment thus serves two purposes. 
First, its passage is intended to reinforce con-
gressional intent that the Department of Inte-
rior and USGS should use funds the bill gives 
to carry out all aspects Section 7002 of the 
Energy Act of 2020 that are applicable to each 
and as directed by that law. This includes de-
veloping and publishing a list of critical min-
erals, coordinating with the Department of En-
ergy to establish and operate a Critical Mate-
rials Information Portal, and working with the 
Department of Labor on a relevant workforce 
challenges. 
Second, my amendment adds $2,000,000 to 
the money USGS is already provided for ef-
forts on critical minerals to improve its ability 
to do this vitally important work. This is the 
most that its budget could be increased in this 
area above what is already provided in the un-
derlying bill within the confines of this appro-
priations legislation. 
I urge all Members to support my amend-
ment. 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
the importance of SCORE and stand in favor 
of the amendment I introduced with Rep. 
SPANBERGER to increase SCORE funding to 
$21.7 million. 
Simply put, this amendment would help 
build businesses and create jobs. 
SCORE is the nation’s largest network of 
volunteer, expert business mentors, with more 
than 10,000 volunteers across 240+ chapters. 
They offer free and confidential advice, and 
free or low-cost educational workshops to cur-
rent and aspiring small business owners. 
Since 1964, SCORE has helped more than 
11 million entrepreneurs to start and grow 
their small business. 
In FY20, SCORE helped its clients to start 
45,027 new businesses and create 74,535 
new jobs. 
It is estimated that this increased funding 
would help SCORE create over 100,000 addi-
tional new businesses and/or jobs, beyond last 
year’s impact numbers. 
Moreover, SCORE is cost-effective. 
In 2020, SCORE clients generated $67.35 
in new federal tax revenue for every $1 appro-
priated to SCORE. 
The need is urgent. As we continue to re-
cover from the COVID pandemic, we need to 
support entrepreneurs in building businesses 
and creating jobs. Our response must meet 
the moment.

ant to House Resolution 555, the gen-

Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON) each will control

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 45 seconds. The en bloc amend-
ment includes a number of proposals 
offered by my Democratic colleagues. 
It reflects our shared values of invest-
ing in the American people to create 
good paying jobs, grow opportunities, 
and provide a lifeline to the vulnerable. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
important proposals that are contained 
in this amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s courtesy 
and I appreciate the work that has 
been done with the en bloc amendment, 
that is, adopted a proposal that I had 
to fully fund the $1.7 million in reoc-
curring annual appropriations to meet 
ongoing operations and maintenance of 
in-lieu fishing sites along the Columbia 
River. 
Mr. Speaker, these are areas that had 
been fished by Native people for a mil-
lennia. But with the construction of 
the dam projects, they were flooded 
out. There was an obligation on our 
part to be able to deal with these sites, 
some of which are used for year-round 
housing, and the conditions are appall-
ing in terms of lack of sanitation, dis-
tressingly unset, not proper electricity, 
sewers, or water. 
I am pleased that we are starting to 
address this opportunity to be able to 
do right by these Native people. It is an 
obligation that is long overdue. If you 
look at it, it is appalling. These are 
conditions that one does not expect to 
see in the United States. These are peo-
ple who have fished in this area for

generations. They deserve to have the 
Federal Government meet its long 
overdue obligations to restore those in- 
lieu fishing sites. 
I appreciate the committee putting 
my amendment in the en bloc, and I 
hope it will move forward so that we 
can finally square accounts with Na-
tive people in these historic sites. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. STRICKLAND). 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chair of the Appropriations 
Committee for her hard work. 
This is an opportunity for me to 
speak on behalf of my amendment con-
cerning the toxic chemical from tires, 
yes, the tires on cars, trucks, and vehi-
cles, that has a chemical that is killing 
coho salmon. 
I thank also Representatives KILMER 
and SCHRIER for their support of this 
amendment and to the combined Wash-
ington State University and University 
of Washington research team for their 
work on this critical issue. 
Late last year, this team found that 
a toxic chemical called 6PPD-quinone 
runs off roadways and into streams 
when it rains, entering the blood-
stream of coho salmon and killing 
them. 
Salmon are fundamental to the Pa-
cific northwest culture and especially 
for our Native American Tribes. David 
Troutt, the Director of National Re-
sources for the Nisqually Indian Tribe 
has said, ‘‘In 1987, we were fishing 105 
days a year. As of 2015, that number 
has reduced to 8 days a year, and if the 
coho population continues to decline, I 
am afraid 8 days will go down to no 
days, disconnecting our community 
from the place they have been for 10,000 
years.’’ 
It is time for us to robustly fund re-
search into this issue today. By sup-
porting my amendment, we are sending 
a message, that Congress is committed 
to funding research at the scale to ad-
dress it. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to have introduced four of the amend-
ments in this en bloc. 
My first amendment would allow the 
Federal Government to start research-
ing new economic metrics that would 
take into account the well-being of 
American families in a way that our 
current GDP measure does not. 
The second amendment addresses 
challenges posed by COVID to remit-
tances and how the Federal Govern-
ment could better facilitate these life-
lines for fragile countries. 
My T-HUD amendment makes sure 
the Federal Government is helping 
manufactured 
housing 
communities 
cope with the pandemic. 
And, lastly, my Interior amendment 
ensures that the NEA prioritizes grants 
for projects that preserve civil rights 
art, such as the projects within the 
George Floyd Memorial site in Min-
neapolis. 
Thank you to the Appropriations 
Committee for including these amend-
ments that will help my district and 
many more. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader 
of the House, and I thank him for his 
kind remarks in his earlier presen-
tation. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I repeat 
my admiration for the chair and the 
work that she has done and the staff 
has done. I thank them very much. 
I might say that the ranking mem-
ber, who is speaking on this bill, is, A, 
a dear friend of mine, and, very frank-
ly, a gentleman who has added real 
quality to this institution and real 
collegiality to this institution. And I 
want you to know, Mr. SIMPSON, how 
much I appreciate your service in the 
House of Representatives. You are my 
friend and a great Member of the Con-
gress. 
Mr. Speaker, the amendment that I 
have offered is a result of my sponsor-
ship of the Help America Vote Act, in 
which I created a program that we 
called the Help America Vote Act. 
However, when we got to the end of the 
write-up of the bill, Bob Ney, who was 
the chairman of the House Administra-
tion Committee, at that point in time 
I was the ranking member, suggested 
that we use that phrase for the bill 
itself. 
However, originally, the Help Amer-
ica Vote Act was a program which 
would encourage colleges to have pro-
grams for their students so that they 
would work on election day in polling 
places. No generation knows these new 
electronic devices for voting better 
than the younger generation. 
And my thought was then, and is 
now, that we ought to encourage young 
people, knowing not only the partisan 
politics that go on, but how America 
runs its elections. So that is what I am 
trying to do here. I have been encour-
aging, and we have appropriated money 
in the past for this program. 
b 1930 
I want to thank my friend from Illi-
nois (Mr. QUIGLEY), who is not on the 
floor, but a good friend of mine for his 
leadership on this subcommittee. I 
thank him and the rest of the sub-
committee members for ensuring that 
the Financial Services and General 
Government Appropriations Act con-
tains robust funding for the Election 
Assistance Commission. Bob Ney and I 
worked on creating that commission. 
It has relatively limited powers, but it 
is a very important ally of local elec-
tion officials. 
This funding for the EAC is critical 
to ensuring secure elections for the 
American 
people. 
My 
amendment 
would take a portion of that funding, 
some $4 million, and use it for the pur-
pose of supporting the Help America 
Vote Act College Poll Worker. 
This program has been a top priority 
for me for two decades. At a time when 
our elections are under stress from 
record turnout, the deployment of new 
technologies, and the realities of the 
pandemic, we need to recruit more 
young Americans to volunteer as non-
partisan poll workers. 
I think any of us who go to the 
polls—of course, all of us in this room 
go to polls on a regular basis—we see 
an aging coterie of poll workers. This 
would add, I think, a real component to 
the volunteers that are available to our 
local election boards. 
I know my election board has a tough 
time recruiting sometimes. You are 
there a 14-, 15-hour day, and it is not 
necessarily the most glamorous job in 
the world. 
Traditionally, many poll workers in 
this country are older Americans. We 
continue to benefit from their experi-
ence and expertise, of course. They 
have much to teach younger Americans 
about how best to staff polling places 
and oversee ballot counting. But with 
COVID–19, many have taken a step 
back and are looking to train the next 
generation in these skills. 
The HAVA College Poll Worker Pro-
gram is a critical tool, in my view, in 
helping communities bring more young 
Americans into this public service. 
Very frankly, I expect them to go to 
their dorm or their neighborhood with 
their peers and say: Hey, I am going to 
work the polls. You ought to come 
down and see me. 
That would be a way to encourage 
younger people to get out and vote. 
As poll workers, young Americans 
will bring their energy, their enthu-
siasm, and their technology know-how 
to help our elections run smoothly. It 
will also instill a love of democracy 
and voting in a new generation of 
Americans who will see firsthand—and 
I am a big proponent of in-person vot-
ing. I am a big proponent of mail bal-
lots as well, but I think going to the 
polls, seeing others there, seeing them 
exercise their democratic franchise is 
an exciting and, frankly, enriching ex-
perience. 
Last year, I met with the presidents 
of colleges throughout the University 
of Maryland system and worked with 
them to encourage students to sign up 
as poll workers and to have programs 
which may be either a half of a credit 
or part of a democracy course or a his-
tory course or some sort of social stud-
ies course saying: This is how we tech-
nically run elections, not partisan. 
This is how we just do it technically, 
how MIKE SIMPSON, STENY HOYER, and 
ROSA DELAURO actually vote on elec-
tion day. 
We don’t know exactly how many 
more students volunteered in 2020 be-
cause there isn’t funding for tracking

get a $20,000 grant to run a program for 
students on how to run an election. It 
may be 3 hours in 1 week or something, 
not a long course. 
With this program, more college stu-
dents will have an opportunity to learn 
how to get involved as nonpartisan poll 
workers so they can step up and help 
make our country and our democracy 
stronger for years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. QUIGLEY, 
Chair DELAURO, and Ranking Member 
SIMPSON for their help in this effort. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me mention the amendments that I 
have in en bloc No. 6. I will focus on a 
few of them. 
I have Nos. 157, 216, 220, 219, 218, 217, 
amendments that I think will make 
the legislation better but also help the 
American people and, certainly, focus 
on issues that are impacting my dis-
trict. But these are universal matters 
that should be addressed. 
My amendment increases and de-
creases funding for the Environmental 
Programs and Management by $5 mil-
lion to highlight the need to support 
culturally competent Federal, State, 
and local public health and environ-
mental protection efforts to address 
cancer 
clusters 
impacting 
overbur-
dened communities in the Gulf Coast 
region. That includes Fifth Ward and 
Kashmere Gardens, among others, in 
the northeast part of Houston which 
have suffered because of creosote con-
tamination, Superfunds, railroads that 
have contaminated the soil. They have 
seen the seismic increase of cancer 
among families. It is going through 
generations. I have met these families, 
and they have had mothers, fathers, 
children, grandchildren have cancer 
and die of cancer. This is an important 
legislative amendment for me. 
Amendment No. 216, very quickly, 
deals with the reckless utilization of 
Federal dollars by the Texas Depart-
ment of Transportation. We have, by 
our community, filed 106 complaints 
against them. This amendment indi-
cates that you cannot put in place a 
transportation project that has not 
been determined to meet the statutory 
and fiduciary obligations of the Na-
tional Historic Preservation Act. It 
pertains to I–45. 
In addition, we provide funding or 
focus on motorcycle, urban bicycle, 
and pedestrian safety. That is a chal-
lenge in the State of Texas, and we 
have had a lot of injuries because of 
the lack of sensitivity to that question. 
In addition, we have a housing 
amendment and other amendments 
that are very important to this legisla-
tion in my district. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc 
Amendment No. 6 to Rules Committee Print 
117–12, which incorporates Jackson Lee 
Amendments Nos. 157, and 216–220. 
I thank the Rules Committee for making 
these amendments in order and Agriculture 
Appropriations Subcommittee Chair PRICE for 
including them in this En Bloc Amendment. 
DIVISION E—INTERIOR AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
Jackson Lee Amendment #157 increases 
and decreases funding for Environmental Pro-
grams and Management by $5 million to high-
light the need to support culturally competent 
federal, state, and local public health and envi-
ronmental protection efforts to address cancer 
clusters impacting overburdened communities 
in the gulf coast region. 
DIVISION G—TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN 
DEVELOPMENT 
Jackson Lee Amendment #216 prohibits the 
Department of Transportation from using funds 
for Section 106 Transportation construction 
projects in urban areas that have not been de-
termined to meet the statutory and fiduciary 
obligations of the National Historic Preserva-
tion Act. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #220 increases 
and decreases the National Infrastructure In-
vestments account by $1,000,000 to empha-
size support for urban bicycle and pedestrian 
safety programs. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #219 increases 
and decreases by $1 million the Federal Rail 
Administration Safety and Operation’s account 
to emphasize the need to provide dedicated 
funding to address community engagement on 
safety issues related railroad crossings in 
urban areas. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #218 provides 
$1,000,000 in assistance to address chal-
lenges faced by communities impacted by per-
sistent poverty and are not included in deci-
sion making when major highway construction 
threatens their homes, businesses, and cul-
turally significant structures. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #217 increases by 
$1,000,000 the Office of Fair Housing and 
Equal Opportunity to address the fairness in 
the use of Community Development Block 
Grant Disaster funding to repair or replace sin-
gle family homes damaged during Hurricane 
Harvey to ensure that multigenerational homes 
can house the family at documented pre-dis-
aster capacity. 
I urge all Members to vote En Bloc Amend-
ment #6 and yield back my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Mrs. 
TORRES) now controls the time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY
K. 
DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Rules and Appro-
priations Committee for bringing my 
amendment to the floor. 
My amendment increases funding for 
the National Institute of Food and Ag-
riculture Research and Education Ac-
tivities account by $2 million by de-
creasing the Agriculture Building and 
Facilities account. I am pleased that 
my colleague, BOBBY
RUSH, co-leads 
this amendment with me. 
The goal of the amendment is to in-
crease funding for the Multicultural 
Scholars Program designed to increase 
the diversity of the food and agricul-
tural scientific and professional work-
force. 
Currently, the Multicultural Schol-
ars 
Program 
receives 
only 
about 
$945,000 a year. This level of funding is 
critically low, given the current racial/ 
ethnicity gaps in food and agricultural 
sciences and given the fact that com-
munities of color were disproportion-
ately harmed by the dual economic and 
health crises in our country. 
For example, even though people of 
color represent nearly one-quarter of 
the U.S. population, farmers of color 
comprise less than 4 percent of owner- 
operators. 
Similarly, about 75 percent of reg-
istered dieticians and nutritionists are 
White. In contrast, only 4 percent of di-
eticians identify as Asian; 3.3 percent 
as Latinx; 2.5 percent identify as 
Black; 1 percent identify as Native Ha-
waiian-Pacific Islander; and 0.6 percent 
identify as American Indian or Native 
Alaskan. 
My amendment is an important step 
to increasing grants to low-income mi-
nority students who attend colleges 
and universities that serve high per-
centages 
of 
individuals 
underrep-
resented in these fields. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
for the opportunity to present. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend and colleague from Cali-
fornia, the chair, for the opportunity 
to speak on behalf of this amendment. 
This would increase the funding for 
the San Francisco Bay restoration 
from $25 million to $30 million, a small 
sum in the scheme of things but huge 
in terms of its impact. 
Over the last 200 years, 90 percent of 
the San Francisco Bay wetlands have 
disappeared. If we don’t act now, the 
damage will be irreversible by 2030. 
The San Francisco Bay estuary is the 
largest estuary west of the Mississippi, 
yet it has been shortchanged in terms 
of resources. Between 2008 and 2016, the 
Environmental Protection Agency in-
vested only $45 million in the San 
Francisco 
Bay. 
Conversely, 
Puget 
Sound received $260 million and Chesa-
peake Bay $490 million. As you can see, 
it has been shortchanged. 
The funding wouldn’t just benefit 
San Francisco. The bay supports 4 mil-
lion jobs, supplying drinking water for 
25 million people, and provides irriga-
tion for about one-half of the Nation’s 
fruit and vegetable production. 
It is critical to all of us. We must in-
vest now to save this ecological treas-
ure. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I am ready to close. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE

The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Honorable KEVIN 
MCCARTHY, Republican Leader: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, July 1, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to Sec-
tion 3(b) of the Public Safety Officer Medal 
of Valor Act of 2001 (42 U.S.C. 15202), I am 
pleased to appoint the following member to

ATTACK ON AMERICA’S TEMPLE 
OF DEMOCRACY 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on the tragic events of January 
6. The lawlessness of the mob that in-
vaded the U.S. Capitol was not solely 
directed against America’s temple of 
democracy, it was also a frontal as-
sault that threatened the lives of hun-
dreds upon hundreds of heroic police of-
ficers, Capitol staff, and Members of 
Congress. 
The rioters, some wearing para-
military equipment, sought to block 
the peaceful transition of executive 
power, which has been a hallmark of 
our Republic for more than two cen-
turies. The January 6 attack was no 
vacation. 
Members of Congress are sworn to 
protect and defend our Constitution. 
Those who encouraged and white- 
washed political violence must be 
called to full account. 
As one Member who was among the 
last to be evacuated, I applaud Chair 
BENNIE THOMPSON and the members for 
their work investigating fully to un-
cover the full truth of the savage bru-
tality to which our Nation and Con-
stitution were subjected, and those 
who are sworn to uphold the law. 
Let the facts lead our country to a 
judgment brought about through jus-
tice, not mob rule. 
f 
HONORING SANTA ANA HIGH 
SCHOOL DEBATE TEAM 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the Santa Ana High 
School debate team, and their coach, 
Sal Tinajero. They won the National 
High School Division Speech Cham-
pionship. They took first place, and 
they won the School of Excellence 
Award. 
More than 1400 schools across the 
country competed at the National 
Speech and Debate Association. This is 
the largest speech and debate tour-
nament in the Nation, and Santa Ana 
High School took first place. 
This is a huge honor. It shows that 
hard work and dedication pays off. I 
thank 
our 
national 
award-winning 
coach, Sal Tinajero, as well, for his 
dedication 
to 
the 
students. 
Coach 
Tinajero started the debate program at 
Santa Ana High School a few years 
ago, and those students have become 
tremendous debaters. 
Coach Sal has shown the Nation that 
Santa Ana is, again, home of cham-
pions. Santa Ana students, we are 
proud of you. We are tremendously ex-
cited that you, again, have shown us 
what you are made of. Coach Sal, 
muchas gracias. 
f

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JULY 27, 2021 
No. 131 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, You are our refuge. Give us 
the wisdom to live so we never dis-
honor Your Name. Provide our law-
makers with power and insight to ac-
complish Your will on Earth, as they 
look to You for help. Become for them 
their shade by day and defense by 
night. As they acknowledge that You 
alone are the source of their strength, 
surround them with the shield of Your 
favor and direct their steps. 
And, Lord, comfort our hearts as we 
mourn the death of our beloved retired 
Senator Mike Enzi. Be especially close 
to his precious Diana and the rest of 
his family. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Morn-
ing business is closed. 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Todd Sunhwae 
Kim, of the District of Columbia, to be 
an Assistant Attorney General. 
Mr. WARNOCK. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I always 
consider it a privilege to open the U.S. 
Senate, be here for the pledge of alle-
giance, be here for the Chaplain’s pray-
er. But I must admit this morning that 
I felt such a sense of sorrow that we 
were praying for my good friend Mike 
Enzi, whom I had the privilege to serve 
with during all the time he was in the 
U.S. Senate. 
We used to spend time together. We 
would talk to each other on votes com-
ing up. He was the old ‘‘old school.’’ He 
always kept his word; he knew I would 
mine. We worked on many things. 
I did remember, through the tears 
this morning as I heard the news, of 
one day when I was chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee and Sen-
ator Enzi came to me and he said: You 
know, I know you are Italian Amer-
ican—which I am on my mother’s 
side—and I am Italian American. And I 
have this nominee. He is one of us. He 
is Italian American. Please push him 
through. 
Well, the nominee backed by Senator 
Enzi was, of course, well qualified any-
way. We put him on the agenda and 
passed him. 
A few weeks later, he came up to me, 
and he said: I have got another nomi-
nee. 
I said: How many Italian Americans 
do you have in Wyoming? 
He said: Oh, this is one of us. He is 
Irish. 
I said: Mike, what do you mean ‘‘he 
is Irish’’? You are Italian. 
He said: No, I am just like you, ex-
cept in reverse. 
He had an Italian father and an Irish 
mother. I had an Irish father and 
Italian mother. 
So he said: He is one of us; you have 
got to get him through—of course, as 
only Mike could, in that gentle humor 
of his. 
And we laughed. And, of course, he 
was well qualified, and we put the 
nominee through. 
A couple of weeks later, he comes up 
to me on something else. I said: Do you 
have another nominee? 
He said: No, but I am looking for a 
French Canadian, and now I am going 
to call your wife Marcelle and say: This 
is one of us. We have got to get him 
through. 
But I tell that story only because it 
was typical of him. He would quietly 
meet with Senators on both sides of 
the aisle. We were different in our po-
litical 
philosophy, 
but 
he 
always 
worked at finding a way we could come 
together. And countless times he would 
bring Democrats and Republicans to-
gether. It was never done with any fan-
fare. He didn’t seek publicity. He 
wasn’t running to the press to say: 
Look what I did; look what I accom-
plished. But he had the thankfulness of 
all of us. 
He and his wife Diana and Marcelle 
and I have spent so many times to-
gether, and you felt this was somebody 
you could be having a backyard bar-
becue with, somebody you could just be

sitting together and watching a sport-
ing event with or anything else. 
I don’t know the full details of the 
tragic accident he had, but I can al-
most see Mike out on his bicycle, in his 
beautiful State, and enjoying the day. I 
do mourn his passage, not only as a 
friend but as somebody who rep-
resented what I feel the Senate has 
been and should be again. So I will 
yield the floor and only say I miss 
Mike Enzi. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
thank my good friend, the senior Sen-
ator from the great State of Vermont. 
I, too, feel so badly about Senator 
Enzi’s unfortunate passing. We re-
ceived the very sad news this morning 
that Mike Enzi had passed away from 
injuries sustained on a bicycle acci-
dent. 
He was only 7 months into his retire-
ment, after four terms in the Senate 
and decades—decades—of service to his 
home State of Wyoming. 
We will remember him as we remem-
bered him upon his departure from this 
Chamber, as a kind and gentle man, as 
a practical legislator, someone who 
sought common ground and was willing 
to leave strained disagreements for an-
other day. He was forceful, he was prin-
cipled, but he was also gentle, a rare 
and unusual combination and much 
needed in this body. 
He lived by a simple creed, given to 
him by his mother, that adorned his of-
fice, and he shared it with his staff: Do 
what you think is right; do your best; 
and treat others the way they wish to 
be treated. 
Upon his retirement, those were the 
values he asked the Senate to remem-
ber him by. At the news of his unex-
pected passing, those are the values we 
will carry on in his memory. I offer my 
condolences to his wife Diana and to 
former Senator Enzi’s entire family. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. President, now on another mat-
ter, Senate business, as Senators con-
tinue to finalize the text of the bipar-
tisan infrastructure agreement, the 
Senate will process several nomina-
tions to the executive branch. Today, 
we will confirm Todd Kim to serve as 
the Assistant Attorney General in 
charge of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Division of the Justice De-
partment, and, tomorrow, the Senate 
will vote on two nominees to the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board, who I 
know will defend the rights and help 
deal with the rights of working people, 
so much needed today when there has 
been such an assault on labor and on 
working people in America. 
Now, the votes of these nominees will 
in no way interfere with my ability to 
reconsider the vote on the motion to 
proceed to a debate on infrastructure. 
We are making good progress on both 
tracks: the bipartisan infrastructure 
and the budget resolution with rec-
onciliation instructions. And, to reit-
erate, Senators should prepare to work 
through the weekend in order to finish 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Now, about January 6, this morning a 
special committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives will convene for the first 
time to begin an inquiry into the 
events of January 6. It is important we 
do this. January 6 was one of the dark-
est episodes in the history of our de-
mocracy, the first time the Capitol was 
breached since the War of 1812. 
In both the runup and aftermath, vi-
cious lies about our elections fueled 
dangerous conspiracies and mob vio-
lence. We must establish a trusted ac-
count of what transpired on January 6, 
what and who caused it. Not just the 
people in the building, as bad as they 
were, but many others may have been 
involved, as well, and I am hopeful that 
this inquiry will get to the bottom of 
that. We have to do this to make sure 
that such an event is never repeated. 
But let me say, Mr. President, we 
have traveled a very sorry road to get 
to this place. The special committee in 
the House was forced into existence be-
cause Senate Republicans and Leader 
MCCONNELL blocked the formation of 
an independent commission, appointed 
on a bipartisan basis, to report on the 
events of the 6th. We had modeled it on 
the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, but 
Leader MCCONNELL stood in the way. 
How did we come to such a moment? 
Well, in the immediate aftermath of 
the attack on the Capitol, the House 
Republican leader said that President 
Trump ‘‘bears responsibility.’’ The Re-
publican leader warned of a ‘‘death spi-
ral’’ for our democracy if election lies 
told by the losing side were to be be-
lieved. Republicans of all stripes, many 
in this Chamber, demanded account-
ability and answers. 
But, in the last 6 months, all that 
courage and truth-telling has evapo-
rated into smoke. All that courage and 
truth-telling 
has 
evaporated 
into 
smoke. What a shame for the Repub-
lican Party. The House Republican 
leader deputized Members of his own 
party to negotiate an independent com-
mission with Democrats, and once they 
did, he stabbed them in the back and 
instructed his Members to vote against 
it. 
Weeks later, the House Republicans 
fired the only member of their leader-
ship team willing to call out President 
Trump’s election lies. House Repub-
licans are now likening January 6 to a 
peaceful protest and a ‘‘normal tourist 
visit.’’ 
Again, I would commend to people 
the New York Times video—40 min-
utes—that 
simply 
documents 
what 
happened. And it is appalling to see one 
of the Congress Members say this was 
like a normal, peaceful visit when you 
watch the violence that occurred be-
fore your very eyes. 
Here in the Senate, the Republican 
minority mounted a partisan filibuster 
to prevent this Chamber from even de-
bating legislation to create an inde-
pendent commission. Is that amazing? 
Every Democratic Member was ap-
palled that they wouldn’t even let a de-
bate on whether to have a commission 
go forward. 
Four months, that is how long it 
took for House and Senate Republican 
leadership, 
who 
denounced 
former 
President Trump in the aftermath of 
January 6, who said they held him 
practically and morally responsible—4 
months was all it took for Republican 
leadership to back down, turn silent, 
and then thwart an independent inves-
tigation into the January 6 attack. 
So, today, the House begins an im-
portant 
task 
under 
the 
only 
cir-
cumstances that congressional Repub-
licans would allow. I have no doubt 
that House Republicans will engage in 
efforts to discredit even this: the work 
of a bipartisan panel of investigators. 
They will dredge up the same dreary 
talking points. They will call it a witch 
hunt. They will call Republicans who 
participate Pelosi Republicans. They 
will cheapen the public discourse even 
more than it has already been cheap-
ened and do their level best to sow dis-
trust about any account of what hap-
pened on January 6. 
For what? Fear of Donald Trump? 
The belief that their political viability 
hinges on whitewashing an attempted 
coup? Who knows. 
But let the record reflect that the 
House will proceed with this important 
investigation and it will be done by 
Members from both parties and that it 
will get at the truth. 
STUDENT LOANS 
Mr. President, now, on student loans, 
final matter: Right now, across the 
country, there are 45 million student 
loan borrowers who owe $1.7 trillion in 
student loan debt. In good times, pay-
ing off tens of thousands, sometimes 
hundreds of thousands in debt can be a 
crushing 
endeavor, 
particularly 
to 
younger people ready to go out in the 
prime of life. But during this pandemic, 
as Americans lost jobs and incomes, it 
has become even harder to pay back 
those loans. 
Fortunately, the Federal Govern-
ment provided a lifeline for tens of mil-
lions of borrowers when they ordered a 
pause on most Federal student loan re-
payments last spring. Of the many 
steps the government has taken to re-
spond to the COVID crisis, this has 
been one of the most effective. 
Unfortunately, this pause will expire 
in a little over 2 months, even while 
many student borrowers are still piec-
ing their lives back together after the 
pandemic. So later today, I will join 
Senator WARREN and my House col-
leagues to call on President Biden to 
extend the pause on student loan pay-
ments until next spring to give Ameri-
cans more time to get back on their 
feet. 
Along with Senator WARREN, I be-
lieve that the Biden administration 
should go even further and cancel up to

$50,000 in student loan debt per bor-
rower. With the flick of a pen, Presi-
dent Biden could give a fresh start to 
tens of millions of borrowers drowning 
in debt—a fresh start, just what they 
need as the country begins a fresh start 
as we recover from COVID. 
Today is as good a day as any to can-
cel student debt.

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The minority leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate is stunned and grieving this 
morning. Our dear friend and former 
colleague Senator Mike Enzi passed 
away last night following a serious 
bike accident this past weekend. 
Mike was 77 years old and only about 
7 months into retirement. Our friend 
was blessed with a great American life, 
and he lived it well. Mike was hugely 
accomplished but at the same time 
humble. He was powerful; he was influ-
ential but earnest and deeply kind. He 
was ambitious, but on behalf of the 
people of Wyoming, not personal gain 
or glory. 
Mike’s quarter-century career in the 
U.S. Senate capped a storied career in 
public service. He was elected mayor of 
Gillette, WY, at just 30 years old. He 
was a young husband, running a family 
business, but he saw an opportunity to 
put his shoulder to help his neighbors. 
Well, to be more precise, our former 
colleague and Mike’s predecessor, Al 
Simpson, gave him a not-so-subtle 
nudge. It was more like conscription. 
Gillette needed help, and this up-and- 
comer was exactly what the booming 
town needed at that time. 
Diana agreed to let Mike throw his 
hat in the ring, and the rest is history. 
The mayor’s office eventually gave way 
to the Wyoming House, then the State 
senate, and then this Senate. 
Here, Mike built a two-part reputa-
tion that might have struck people as 
contradictory. On the one hand, Mike 
was a principled, hard-nosed conserv-
ative. He chaired the HELP Committee 
and the Budget Committee with a 
small businessman’s painstaking finan-
cial eye. In fact, when he first un-
packed his office, Mike was the Sen-
ate’s only trained accountant. He was 
central to getting generational tax re-
form off the starting blocks. He was a 
policy leader in our conference. But at 
the same time, this principled west-
erner was also universally known as 
one of the kindest, most thoughtful, 
most respectful Senators on either side 
of the aisle. 
Mike’s famous 80–20 rule helped him 
find bipartisan common ground on a 
long list of significant issues. I know 
he was particularly proud of his focus 
on the global fight against AIDS. 
On the HELP Committee, Mike cut 
important deals with his counterpart 
and ideological opposite, Ted Kennedy. 
Neither Senator walked away from his 
principles; they just wanted to find 
where those principles actually fit to-
gether. 
Mike’s policy wins were many. But at 
the end of the day, Mike knew what ev-
eryone else around here knew: His 
greatest accomplishment was winning 
Diana’s hand and building their family 
together. 
Their marriage, their partnership, 
was a Senate institution unto itself. 
The Enzis’ kindness overflowed into 
legendary parties and generous gifts 
for the entire Senate community, espe-
cially the behind-the scenes all-stars 
who do not get thanked nearly enough. 
So Mike Enzi departed the Senate 
having changed policy and law for the 
better because of his mind. And now he 
has departed this life having changed 
his friends and his colleagues for the 
better because of his heart. 
Today, the entire Senate stands in 
solidarity with Diana at this tragic 
time, which has come entirely too 
soon. Our prayers are with her, their 
three children, and their grandchildren 
and the entire family. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. President, on a totally different 
matter, while American families worry 
about rising costs, Washington Demo-
crats want to embark on yet another 
reckless, multitrillion-dollar taxing- 
and-spending spree. Recent surveys 
show that more than 80 percent of 
Americans are somewhat or very wor-
ried about the rising cost of living. And 
73 percent say they are worried about 
impending tax hikes. But our Demo-
cratic colleagues have dreamt up an-
other 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree that would stick families with 
even higher costs, even higher taxes, 
and an even shakier economy. 
The 
overall 
pricetag 
is 
so 
out-
rageous—outrageous—and the poten-
tial economic damage so significant 
that you can almost forget to look at 
all the terrible policies Democrats are 
hoping to hide behind the jaw-dropping 
dollar figure: blanket amnesty for ille-
gal immigrants; pieces of their effort 
to take over all 50 States’ election laws 
under false pretenses; a socialist price- 
setting scheme for prescription medi-
cine that would lead to fewer new 
treatments, fewer new cures, and espe-
cially hurt people with rare or unusual 
diseases; a bill that would have ‘‘the 
swamp’’ redistributing money away 
from working families who don’t make 
childcare arrangements the way Demo-
crats want. 
And then there is the huge catalog of 
expensive and radical Green New Deal 
policies that Democrats say they want 
to ram through as part of this spree. 
For example, Democrats want to use a 
party-line vote to slap an expensive 
new carbon tax on certain imports be-
fore American consumers get to buy 
them. That is after already sticking 
working families with higher prices 
due to inflation. 
To add insult to injury, international 
trade experts warned this new carbon 
tax scheme will lead to foreign retalia-
tion, costing our Nation jobs, wages, 
and economic prosperity. 
It is a one-two punch, threatening 
the livelihoods of working families 
across our country. Just ask the Amer-
ican farmers who worry foreign retalia-
tion will depress their grain and live-
stock prices while increasing their 
input costs like fertilizer. 
Democrats also want a new set of 
top-down mandates that would crush 
the affordable forms of energy that 
keep Americans’ lights on, heat and 
cool Americans’ homes, put gas in 
Americans’ cars, and provide a whole 
lot of American workers their jobs. 
They want every Senate Democrat to 
line up unanimously behind the most 
liberal plans to wage a war on fossil 
fuels. 
I have said it before, and I will say it 
again. Our distinguished colleague, 
Chairman BERNIE SANDERS, may not 
have won the last Presidential pri-
mary, but on the Democratic side, it 
sure looks like his socialist philosophy 
is winning the war. House Democrats, 
the far left, and the administration 
keep floating this endless eco-socialist 
shopping list, and apparently, they ex-
pect every single Senate Democrat to 
simply fall in line. 
They want to further expand job tax 
credit giveaways for costly electric 
cars when 80 percent is going to house-
holds earning six figures and up. 
They also want money and mandates 
to push the entire Federal Government 
fleet toward electric cars as well. So 
wouldn’t you just love to see an IRS 
auditor pull up to your tax audit in a 
$97,000 Tesla? 
By the way, the Biden administra-
tion’s own statistics admit the com-
parable gas-powered vehicle would cost 
taxpayers tens of thousands less. 
Democrats have even floated big Fed-
eral giveaways for electric schoolbuses, 
but zero help if rural schools need to 
replace a diesel bus with another die-
sel—just what rural school boards have 
been longing for. 
And don’t forget Democrats’ discus-
sion of using Federal dollars to re-
model or reconstruct millions of homes 
or buildings they find insufficiently 
‘‘green.’’ 
I remember a while back when Demo-
crats won one outlet’s ‘‘Lie of the 
Year’’ award for promising: If you like 
your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 
Maybe this year will feature a re-
make: If you like your house, you can 
keep your house. 
It just does not end, Mr. President. It 
reads like one mass effort to upend life 
in places like Kentucky, West Virginia, 
Montana, and Iowa and all throughout 
the American heartland until it fits 
the fashions of west coast million-
aires—another 
effort 
to 
push

unaffordable, unworkable Green New 
Deal on American families who do not 
want it. This is just one corner of the 
absurd, reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree that our Democratic colleagues 
are cooking up. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Wyoming. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to pay tribute 
to our friend and former colleague, 
Senator Mike Enzi. 
Senator LUMMIS and I are here, and 
we are very grateful for the kind com-
ments of the minority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL; majority leader, Senator 
SCHUMER; and the President pro tem-
pore of the Senate, Senator LEAHY. 
Mike Enzi was my colleague. He was 
my mentor. He was my friend. Today, 
my wife Bobbi and I, along with all of 
the people in the State of Wyoming and 
all of his friends and admirers here in 
the U.S. Senate—we are joined on the 
floor by many of his former staffers, 
many of whom still work here—all of 
us mourn his passing. 
For nearly a quarter of a century, 
Mike Enzi represented the people of 
Wyoming in this very body in the U.S. 
Senate. In so many ways, as we served 
as a team when CYNTHIA LUMMIS was in 
the House and Mike and I were in the 
Senate, he was our trusted trail boss 
for our entire congressional delegation. 
He served with intelligence, with dig-
nity, and with grace. He never wavered. 
His commitment was to God, to his 
family, to country, to Wyoming. 
It was an incredible honor and a 
great privilege for my wife Bobbi and 
for me to serve the people of Wyoming 
alongside Mike Enzi and his wife 
Diana. 
Mike was born in the middle of World 
War II. He was in Washington State at 
the time because that is where his fa-
ther was stationed. After the war, the 
family moved back to Thermopolis, 
WY—my 
wife’s 
hometown—and 
to 
Sheridan, WY. 
As all of us know, Mike was an Eagle 
Scout, so were his son Brad and his 
grandson Trey. They followed in his 
footsteps. Later in life, he was awarded 
the Distinguished Eagle Scout. 
He went on and studied accounting. 
He earned a business degree, and he fo-
cused on marketing. He was pretty 
good at it. He served in the Wyoming 
Air National Guard, and he was 6 years 
a tech sergeant. 
In 1969, Mike and Diana were mar-
ried. One week later, they moved to 
Gillette and opened a small business 
known as NZ Shoes—Enzi, like his 
name, but the letter ‘‘N’’ and letter 
‘‘Z’’ Shoes. The little business wasn’t 
that little for long. He opened a second 
store in Sheridan, then Miles City, MT. 
Mike ran for mayor of Gillette, 
served two 4-year terms. He often 
called being mayor the toughest job in 
politics, and Mike performed flaw-
lessly. With the help of his business 
skills, Gillette went into an economic 
boom. He served 10 years in the Wyo-
ming Legislature as both a State rep-
resentative and a State senator. 
When he came here to the Senate, 
Mike became a leading voice—a leading 
voice on budgets, on taxes, and on 
healthcare issues. In 2015, he became 
the first accountant to ever chair the 
Budget Committee. He brought to 
Washington the valuable lessons that 
he had learned in the Wyoming Legis-
lature, and he put them to use right 
here. 
He would say: Like American fami-
lies, Wyoming has to balance its budg-
et every year, live within our means, 
and so should America. 
Under Mike’s leadership, Congress 
passed 
three 
consecutive 
balanced 
budget regulations. During his time as 
chairman, Congress also passed the 
largest tax cuts and reforms in a gen-
eration. And those tax cuts gave us the 
best economy of our lifetimes. 
Mike also chaired the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
in the Senate. As chairman, he spear-
headed the most significant pension re-
form in 30 years. Mike’s legacy in the 
U.S. Senate also included improving 
mine safety, helping in the AIDS epi-
demic in Africa, passing mental health 
parity. 
His highest priority, of course, was 
always helping the people of Wyoming. 
Over his 24 years in office, Mike and his 
capable staff helped the people of Wyo-
ming through more than 15,000 pieces 
of casework. They helped veterans get 
the benefits that they had earned. 
They helped seniors get Social Secu-
rity. They helped people become natu-
ralized citizens. 
When he announced his retirement, 
he said: 
I am an advocate for Gillette and Campbell 
County and Wyoming. 
He said: 
Everyone lives at the local level. No one 
lives at the Federal level, or even the State 
level. 
He said: 
Diana and I are your Chamber of Com-
merce and your economic development peo-
ple for every town and county in Wyoming 
all the time. 
Mike started several annual events in 
Wyoming to boost Wyoming. One was 
the Inventors Conference; another, the 
Procurement Conference; and then Wy-
oming Works tour. 
In 2009, Mike and I started Wyoming 
Wednesdays. This is when people from 
around Wyoming come to Washington, 
and we get together—our delegation— 
for coffee, for donuts, and for fellow-
ship. We are proud to continue the tra-
dition today. 
Above all, Mike was a moral leader in 
the Senate. He taught Sunday school 
for decades and he learned from the 
best. Mike’s first Sunday school teach-
er was in Thermopolis, WY, and his 
teacher was my wife Bobbi’s mother, 
Jerry Brown. Mike Enzi was her star 
pupil. She actually gave Mike his first 
Bible. 
Well, that benefited all of us because, 
decades later, Mike Enzi became a 
leader of our bipartisan Senate prayer 
breakfast. As a member of that group, 
I saw firsthand how Republican and 
Democrat Senators looked to Mike 
Enzi for moral and ethical guidance. He 
was a guiding light. 
On my first day in the Senate, Mike 
gave me this book. It is called ‘‘One 
Quiet Moment,’’ and it is a daily pray-
er devotion. This is how he inscribed it 
in 2007. He said: 
John, here’s a book that has helped me 
through 11 years of the Senate. It’s amazing 
how often the message of the day relates to 
what’s going on in my life. 
He said: 
These messages provide strength. 
Mike Enzi—June 26, 2007. 
So the message of the day provides 
strength. Let us turn to July 27, today. 
The message is from Philippians. The 
message is three words: ‘‘I press on.’’ 
The message of today: ‘‘I press on.’’ 
It goes down to the bottom, and it 
says: 
My steps forward today may be small, but 
at least they are steps off dead center. Keep 
me moving, Lord! 
It is Mike’s message through this 
book for us to press on. As I said, Mike 
Enzi was a moral compass for many of 
us, and he always pointed True North. 
He was a friend and a mentor to me, 
to so many Senators on both sides of 
the aisle over 24 years. He knew how to 
find common ground and bring people 
together better than any. 
It was rare for an Enzi bill to receive 
fewer than 80 votes. This was by design. 
Mike called it his 80–20 rule. He learned 
in the Wyoming State Legislature. At 
the beginning of each year, each mem-
ber of his committee made a list of 
their priorities. Most years there was 
bipartisan agreement on 80 percent of 
the priorities. Mike Enzi would then 
focus on that 80 percent on which they 
agreed, and he would leave out the 20 
percent on which they disagreed. As a 
result of this approach, Mike Enzi 
wrote more than 80 bills which were 
signed into law by four different Presi-
dents in the United States, two Repub-
licans and two Democrats. I was proud 
to cosponsor many of those bills with 
him here in the Senate. 
Yet for all of Mike’s achievements in 
business and in government, we will 
miss him most as a friend. Following 
his retirement, Mike did an interview 
with Wyoming Public Broadcasting. He 
said there wasn’t much he would miss 
about Washington, DC. He said it was 
the people whom he would miss the 
most. 
Mike had a dedicated, hard-working, 
and loyal staff. Some of them returned 
to Wyoming, others still serve in this 
body today, and a number have joined 
us on the floor. Mike gave much of the 
credit for his success to these folks. I 
know they are all feeling a huge loss 
today. 
Mike used to say there aren’t many 
things better than being a Senator 
from Wyoming, but he used to joke 
that two of them are fly fishing and 
being a grandfather. Mike had a great

love of nature, which is easy when you 
live in Wyoming. Mike was an accom-
plished and avid fly fisherman. In fact, 
in August of 2015, he achieved every fly 
fisherman’s 
dream. 
He 
completed 
something known as Wyoming’s Cutt- 
Slam. This is a Wyoming Game and 
Fish Department program, which in-
creases appreciation for our native cut-
throat trout. 
Yet Mike would tell you the achieve-
ment that he was most proud of, of 
course, is family. He is survived by his 
wife Diana; his children Amy, Emily, 
and 
Brad; 
and 
his 
grandchildren 
Megan, Allison, Trey, and Lilly. 
When he retired earlier this year, 
Mike said: ‘‘None of this would have 
happened without Diana. The best 
thing that ever happened to me,’’ he 
said, is when she said she would marry 
him. 
Diana is a wonderful person. She used 
to host an annual Christmas cookie 
party here in the Senate. She did it to 
say thank you to all of those whom she 
called the real workers: the janitors, 
the cleaning crew, the electricians, the 
police officers, the food service work-
ers, and her staff. Every year, Diana 
and her friends baked hundreds of doz-
ens of cookies. My wife Bobbi often 
joined in the cooking of literally thou-
sands of cookies of all varieties and all 
made with loving care. It was so pop-
ular around here that people used to 
walk up to Diana and Mike in the hall-
way and ask: When is the party? 
It had been a tremendous privilege 
for my wife Bobbi and me to serve for 
13 years with Mike and Diana, rep-
resenting Wyoming in the U.S. Senate. 
The people of Wyoming will always be 
extremely grateful—grateful for his 
decades of faithful, tireless service. 
May God bless the memory of Mike 
Enzi. May God comfort his family dur-
ing this extremely trying time. And 
may God continue to bless the State of 
Wyoming. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. President, today, 
Wyoming mourns the loss of a gentle 
giant, Mike Enzi. 
Mike spent his life working to make 
Wyoming a better place while creating 
opportunities for our people. As the 
mayor of Gillette, a State legislator, or 
as a U.S. Senator and senior states-
man, Wyoming had no greater cham-
pion than Mike Enzi. He always put 
Wyoming first and worked harder than 
anyone to serve his constituents. 
Growing up, Mike’s dad would say: I 
don’t care if he is a doctor or a lawyer 
or a ditchdigger; I just want him to be 
proud of what he does. If he is a ditch-
digger, I want any darned fool to be 
able to look at that ditch and say: 
That is a Mike Enzi ditch. 
That creed became commonplace in 
Mike’s Senate office. 
I will echo Mike’s former chief of 
staff, Coy Knobel, by saying: I think it 
is a pretty good ditch. 
Mike was a soft-spoken leader, but 
the many legislative wins he delivered 
attest to the impact of his service. At 
a time of increasing political incivil-
ity, Mike Enzi managed to tactfully 
and graciously navigate the upper 
Chamber, producing results that will 
be felt for generations to come. His re-
tirement left a hole in the Senate, and 
his death to this world leaves a hole in 
our State and in our hearts. 
Throughout Mike’s career in the Sen-
ate, he came up with multiple plans to 
address our debt and deficit. As an ac-
countant by training and trade, he 
knew how to balance a budget and 
make it through the lean times. He 
wanted to set our great Nation up for 
success for his children and his grand-
children. 
My prayers are with his wife Diana; 
his children Amy, Emily, and Brad; and 
his four grandchildren at this very dif-
ficult time. I know they are proud of 
the powerful legacy he leaves behind. 
We all are, and we have every right to 
be. 
To me, personally, he was more than 
just our senior Senator. I have known 
Mike since the early 1980s, and over the 
last 40 years, he has been my personal 
friend and, as JOHN
BARRASSO
said, 
mentor. We first worked together when 
we were both in the Wyoming State 
Legislature. Then we served together 
in the Wyoming State Senate. Finally, 
when he came to the U.S. Senate, I fol-
lowed him a few years later to the 
House of Representatives. I always 
joked that I was just following him 
around like a puppy dog my whole life. 
Mike taught me about legislating, 
but he also taught me about life. He 
had a rock-solid faith. His faith was his 
guiding light. It is something that my 
late husband had, too, and I take com-
fort in knowing that Mike is peacefully 
at home in Heaven with his Lord and 
Savior. I am Lutheran, and in Martin 
‘‘Luther’s Small Catechism,’’ it says 
that Christians like Mike and me and 
John are redeemed so that I may be His 
own and live under Him in His King-
dom and serve Him in everlasting 
righteousness, innocence, and blessed-
ness. 
I note that because Mike was such a 
servant leader. He gave his earthly life 
to public service, and as Heaven is an 
everlasting service of the Lord, I know 
that no one is more prepared for that 
than Mike. He was a servant leader on 
Earth, and I know he will be a servant 
leader in Heaven. 
I will say one last thing. Mike’s un-
expected death is a reminder that you 
can never say thank you to the ones 
you care about and appreciate too soon 
or too often. I, along with John, was 
blessed to be able to pay tribute to 
Mike’s lasting accomplishments and 
impact on Wyoming just last week 
when JOHN BARRASSO and I recorded a 
tribute to him and his service to Wyo-
ming’s mining community. At this 
event honoring Mike Enzi, at which he 
was in attendance in his hometown of 
Gillette, he joked, he had fun, and he 
got to enjoy the camaraderie of the 
people in the State he loved so very 
much. 
I am grateful, John, that you and I 
got to say thank you to him one last 
time like that. 
I am heartbroken that Mike has 
passed away from this life. For selfish 
reasons, I will miss him terribly. He 
was a beloved, kind Member of the U.S. 
Senate. He was an accomplished, quiet 
leader. He was Wyoming’s friend. He 
was my friend. 
God bless you, Mike. We will see you 
down the road. Happy trails. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I 
begin, I want to join with my col-
leagues from Wyoming and my other 
colleagues here in the Senate and ex-
press my sorrow at the news received 
this morning that our former colleague 
Senator Mike Enzi had passed away. 
Mike was a cherished colleague and 
one of the finest human beings you will 
ever meet. A former Budget Committee 
chairman, he was, in many ways, the 
conscience of the Senate on spending 
issues, always reminding Members that 
Federal dollars are not unlimited and 
that every dollar we add to the debt is 
a burden we are placing on our children 
and grandchildren. 
One of my favorite memories of Mike 
happened a few years ago when he was 
a neighbor next door in the State of 
Wyoming. He was someone, as I said, 
for whom I had tremendous respect. He 
was always a gentleman. He had some-
thing that, I think, in politics is really 
rare, and that is, he would deal with 
big policy issues here in Washington, 
DC, but he always retained his common 
touch. He had a terrific way of con-
necting with people on a very personal 
level. 
I remember I was experiencing heel 
pain from overrunning, which, it turns 
out, was plantar fasciitis, and I hap-
pened to mention it to Mike, who at 
one time was a shoe salesman and a 
shoe store owner. Well, it isn’t more 
than a day later or so when he comes 
up to me and he has a solution. He had 
some heel inserts for my shoes, which 
turned out to be just exactly one of the 
solutions that I needed to deal with 
that. That was very typical of Senator 
Enzi. He was thoughtful. He was prac-
tical, 
incredibly 
hard-working, 
and 
very, very smart and very, very prin-
cipled. 
To his family—to his wife Diana, his 
wife of more than 50 years, and to his 
children and grandchildren—I want to 
say how much we will deeply miss him 
and how much we are sending our 
thoughts and prayers to them during 
this very, very difficult time. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, on a different topic, 
last week, the Department of Edu-
cation officially backed away from 
prioritizing radical and divisive propa-
ganda in applications for a Federal pro-
gram for civics and American history 
education. Score one for sanity and for 
American history. 
The Department’s original proposed 
priorities for program applications had

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5080 
July 27, 2021 
focused on aspects of so-called critical 
race theory and cited such dubious 
items as the 1619 Project. The notice 
the Department of Education released 
last week dropped this discussion and 
indicated that the Department would 
not give a competitive advantage to 
applications that reflect critical race 
theory. 
The bipartisan program in question 
was established to strengthen Amer-
ican history and civics education, 
which is in a bad way. Just 15 percent 
of eighth graders demonstrate pro-
ficiency in American history, accord-
ing to the most recent National Assess-
ment of Educational Progress results. 
A 2019 survey found that just 4 in 10 
American adults were capable of pass-
ing a U.S. citizenship test. Yet the 
Biden administration was apparently 
ready to compound this problem by 
pushing ideas rooted in critical race 
theory—a radical, leftist ideology. 
As it is currently being pushed, crit-
ical race theory advances the idea that 
America is not merely flawed but in-
herently and systematically evil and 
that fixing this problem requires tear-
ing down our institutions. 
I don’t need to tell anyone that the 
United States has an imperfect history, 
and any genuine approach to American 
history has to examine those times 
when we failed to live up to our ideals 
as well as those times when we have 
succeeded. But while there are sins in 
our past that we cannot ignore, like 
the great sins of slavery and segrega-
tion, there is also greatness. 
Our Founders did something that was 
pretty much unprecedented in the his-
tory of the world. They sat down and 
built a country based not on who con-
quered whom but on a set of principles, 
on a shared belief in liberty and 
unalienable human rights. While we 
haven’t always lived up to those be-
liefs, we have never stopped trying, and 
we continue to hold out the promise of 
liberty not only to our country but to 
the whole world. There is a reason indi-
viduals around the globe have fled to 
these shores for the promise of freedom 
and have found in the United States 
the refuge they were searching for. 
Critical race theory distorts the re-
ality of American history. It sees our 
failures but none of our successes. 
More than that, it actively misrepre-
sents our history. The 1619 Project, for 
example, advances the totally fab-
ricated claim that a primary motiva-
tion for the American Revolution was a 
desire 
to 
preserve 
slavery. 
That 
couldn’t be further from the truth. It is 
no surprise that leading historians 
have criticized the 1619 Project for its 
historical distortions and factual inac-
curacies. 
On top of that, by demonizing the 
United States, critical race theory also 
invites students to despise our country 
and ignore the tremendous freedoms 
and blessings that we enjoy. We are in-
credibly fortunate to live in the United 
States of America, and we let our stu-
dents down when we fail to give them 
the perspective to see the blessings our 
country provides. 
By dividing the world into oppressors 
and oppressed, critical race theory pro-
motes resentment and victimization. It 
encourages individuals to look at the 
world through one lens and one lens 
only and tends to reduce individuals to 
little more than their racial back-
ground. 
I am glad that the Department of 
Education chose not to give preference 
to applicants with a focus on the rad-
ical ideas of critical race theory. This 
was good news for America’s students, 
who deserve a balanced accounting of 
our Nation’s history, which critical 
race theory does not provide. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that I be able to complete my re-
marks before the vote starts. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there is 
still a lot of reason to be concerned. 
The Department’s reversal was cloaked 
in bureaucratic language, leaving room 
for a future flip-flop by the administra-
tion. Too many schools around the 
country are already considering or 
adopting outlandish proposals informed 
by critical race theory, from a math 
course that suggests that focusing on 
the right answer in math is grounded 
in racism to materials implying that 
the nuclear family is somehow inher-
ently racist. 
This is a grave disservice to students 
of all races, and we need to make sure 
that Federal education dollars are 
going to genuine history and civics 
education and not radical propaganda. 
We owe all American students better 
than historically inaccurate history 
lessons. 
I yield the floor.

July 27, 2021 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
CAPITOL SECURITY SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, it 
has been more than 200 days since the 
U.S. Capitol was attacked by mobs of 
anti-government 
insurrectionists. 
It 
was the darkest day for Congress in 
more than 200 years, since invading 
troops set this magnificent building on 
fire 200 years ago. 
Americans 
in 
uniform 
that 
day 
stepped up to protect Congress. The of-
ficers of the Capitol Police and other 
law enforcement agencies literally put 
their lives on the line to protect Sen-
ators, Congressmen, and to protect our 
Constitution. 
More than 25,000 members of the Na-
tional Guard also came from across the 
country to secure Capitol Hill, includ-
ing from my home State of Montana. 
Words cannot express my thanks for 
what these men and women did on be-
half of our Nation, and their service 
was not without sacrifice. 
Police officers were assaulted by an 
angry mob, and we know that post- 
traumatic stress is a real problem for 
many who had been to hell and back. 
The citizen soldiers of the National 
Guard stood watch day and night. 
Now, today, we find out that pay is 
running short for both Capitol Police 
and the members of the National 
Guard. The good news is that after 
weeks of Senate negotiations, we are 
on the verge of a bipartisan deal that 
ensures that the Capitol Police will 
have the money to pay its officers for 
the rest of the year. 
And as chairman of the Defense Ap-
propriations Committee, I have worked 
with Vice Chairman SHELBY on two 
critical funding items to be included in 
this bill. 
First, we have agreed that the Na-
tional Guard urgently needs $521 mil-
lion to pay them for securing this Cap-
itol. This funding will allow the sum-
mer drill season to proceed without 
interruption. 
We 
need 
a 
prepared 
Guard. 
Second, we have learned of the sub-
stantial costs of moving Afghans who 
helped our military get out of that 
country safely. We owe a debt to those 
brave Afghans, who risked their lives 
to support our American troops. That 
debt can never be fully repaid. 
I would like to thank Chairman 
LEAHY and Vice Chairman SHELBY for 
working with me on this important 
bill. I hope we can seal the deal very 
soon and have this measure approved 
by the Senate today because it is our 
job to defend the brave officers who de-
fended us on January 6 and who con-
tinue their tireless work to keep us 
safe today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to strongly op-
pose the nomination of Tracy Stone- 
Manning. 
I want to focus my remarks now on 
the misleading and false statements 
that Tracy Stone-Manning has made to 
the Senate and how they just don’t 
align with the facts. 
On 
her 
committee 
questionnaire, 
which is a sworn affidavit that every 
nominee fills out, the committee clear-
ly asks: Have you ever been inves-
tigated? 
Tracy Stone-Manning said she had 
not. 
On the same document, she also stat-
ed that she testified for a grand jury 
about an alleged tree spiking. Well, 
these statements are not true, and Ms. 
Stone-Manning knows it. 
Tree spiking involves hammering a 
metal spike, like this one, into the 
trunk of a tree. Ecoterrorists use 
spikes like this. This is something they 
do to prevent loggers from harvesting 
trees. If a saw blade hits that spike, it 
destroys the saw, and metal shrapnel 
flies in every direction. The results can 
be catastrophic. 
The trees in the Clearwater National 
Forest were spiked in 1989. Individuals 
were found guilty of this crime, and a 
local sawmill was damaged as a result 
of the spikes. Some of the trees stand-
ing today are still spiked and can still 
do damage to loggers and firefighters. 
These are serious dangers and damages 
that can occur to people still today. 
If there is a forest fire in the Clear-
water National Forest, a smoke jumper 
may need to cut down trees to slow the 
spread of the fire. If that person hits a 
spike with a chain saw, it could kill or 
maim 
the 
firefighter. 
Worse 
still, 
Tracy Stone-Manning knew who the 
ecoterrorists were, and she could have 
turned them in at the start. 
In 1989, she edited, typed, and sent 
this vile, threatening letter to the men 
and women of the U.S. Forest Service. 
She did it on behalf of the tree spikers. 
The letter included lines like: 
You bastards go in there anyway and a lot 
of people could get hurt. 
She went on: 
I would be more than willing to pay you a 
dollar for the sale, but you would have to 
find me first, and that could be your WORST 
nightmare. 
Tracy Stone-Manning has said since 
the incident that she mailed this dis-
turbing, threatening letter to warn 
people of the danger of the spiked 
trees. But she didn’t go to the authori-
ties. No, she did not. She did not go to 
the police. No, not at all. She took ex-
traordinary steps to ensure that she 
and the tree spikers would never get 
caught. 
If she had gone to the police, the For-
est Service would have been much bet-
ter able to identify the spiked trees. In-
stead, she covered up for the criminals 
for years. All the while, these trees re-
main spiked and remain incredibly 
dangerous. 
Ms. Stone-Manning told our com-
mittee that she was never investigated. 
Well, that was a lie. Following the tree 
spiking in 1989, she was subpoenaed by 
investigators to provide hair samples, 
fingerprints, 
writing 
samples, 
and 
other physical evidence. 
These are criminal investigators. 
Press articles at the time confirm this 
fact, as do the court documents ob-
tained by the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee. This is further 
verified by the letter that our com-
mittee received by the lead criminal 
investigator for the U.S. Forest Serv-
ice, Mr. Michael Merkley. We received 
this letter after she had testified in 
front of the Senate committee a few 
months ago. 
He wrote: 
. . . the grand jury issued subpoenas for 
hair samples, handwriting exemplars, and 
fingerprints. These subpoenas were served on 
persons suspected of having knowledge of the 
incident, including Ms. Tracy Stone-Man-
ning. 
But don’t take his word for it. Let’s 
listen to the words of Tracy Stone- 
Manning herself. In a 1990 article about 
law enforcement’s investigation at the 
University of Montana, she complained 
about how the investigation made her 
feel. 
She said: 
It was degrading. It changed my awareness 
of the power of the government. 
Through this entire period, she did 
not tell the truth to the investigators. 
Remember, she knew who spiked the 
trees. She sent a threatening letter to 
them. She never went to the police, 
and 
she 
never 
identified 
the 
ecoterrorists. She also didn’t cooper-
ate. 
The lead investigator says in his let-
ter that the committee has received 
since the time she testified to the com-
mittee a few months ago—he said: 
Through this initial investigation in 1989, 
Ms. Stone-Manning was extremely difficult 
to work with; in fact she was the nastiest of 
suspects. . . . she was vulgar, antagonistic, 
and extremely anti-government. 
He goes on to say she refused to com-
ply with the investigation until she 
learned she would be arrested if she did 
not. 
But the investigation of Tracy Stone- 
Manning did not end in 1989 with the 
subpoenas. In December of 1992, after 
years of her covering up for the 
ecoterrorists, she was identified as the 
one who sent the threatening letter. A 
woman connected with the group came 
forward and gave her name to inves-
tigators. 
Mr. MERKLEY writes, again, in this 
letter we received since Stone-Manning

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5082 
July 27, 2021 
has testified in her committee hearing 
in the Senate—he writes: 
[A]s a result of Ms. Lilburn’s testimony, 
the grand jury sent Tracy Stone-Manning a 
target letter, which meant she was going to 
be indicted on criminal charges for her ac-
tive participation in planning these crimes. 
Her lawyer then negotiated an immu-
nity deal. She would testify against the 
individuals who spiked the trees. And 
she knew she could have been charged. 
In an interview published in a 1983 ar-
ticle in ‘‘The Missoulian,’’ Stone-Man-
ning said that she could have been 
charged with conspiracy if not for the 
immunity deal. 
Remember, she told the Senate she 
had never been investigated. She was 
subpoenaed for physical evidence. She 
was investigated. She didn’t cooperate 
with investigators. She complained to 
the press about being investigated, and 
she covered up for the ecoterrorists for 
years until she was caught. But that 
wasn’t her only lie. On our committee’s 
questionnaire for the record, I asked 
her: 
Did you have personal knowledge of, par-
ticipate in, or in any way directly or indi-
rectly support activities associated with the 
spiking of trees in any forest during your 
lifetime? 
In any forest during your lifetime? 
She responded: 
No. 
Everyone knows that is a lie. She 
sent their letter. She knew who they 
were. She supported their activities. 
The lead investigator’s letter makes 
clear she knew the plan to spike the 
trees in the Idaho forest in advance. 
He wasn’t the only one—this lead 
criminal investigator wasn’t the only 
one to say she knew so in advance. One 
of the convicted tree spikers, one of the 
people who went to jail in this episode, 
he told E&E News—again, since the 
hearing and since the letter has come 
out, just in the last couple weeks, the 
convicted tree spiker says: ‘‘She knew 
about it far in advance, a couple of 
months before we headed out.’’ 
He continued: ‘‘She had agreed to 
mail the letter well in advance.’’ 
To be clear, after Tracy Stone-Man-
ning had her confirmation hearing here 
in the Senate earlier this year, two 
people with direct knowledge came for-
ward. One was the cop—the criminal 
investigator 
who 
investigated 
the 
crime. The other was the criminal who 
was convicted. Both the cop and the 
criminal say she lied. 
Ms. Stone-Manning helped plan the 
tree spiking. She knew about it in ad-
vance. She sent a threatening letter to 
the Forest Service. She was inves-
tigated. 
She 
collaborated 
with 
ecoterrorists. She lied to the Senate. 
Lying to the U.S. Senate has con-
sequences. In this case, her actions and 
her lies should cost her this nomina-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague, Senator 
BARRASSO, for leading the effort to do 
what is the obvious thing to do on the 
U.S. Senate floor. Here, in a couple 
minutes, we are going to vote on one of 
the most extreme nominees I have ever 
seen to be nominated for anything re-
quiring the confirmation of the U.S. 
Senate. 
To be honest, I can’t believe we are 
even really having this debate. I can’t 
believe that the Senate is going to put 
forward and vote on an ecoterrorist. I 
can’t believe the President of the 
United States, after maybe not recog-
nizing who he put forward, didn’t with-
draw the nomination. And yet here we 
are. 
We know this administration sup-
ports far-left groups and certainly has 
nominated some far-left nominees for 
Senate confirmation to important posi-
tions in the Federal Government. But 
what hasn’t happened yet is—they have 
knowingly put forward a far-left nomi-
nee who has clearly lied to the Senate, 
as 
Senator 
BARRASSO
just 
showed 
clearly, who is not just a far-left ex-
tremist, she is a violent extremist. 
So, normally, you would think in 
America that would disqualify you 
from a position that requires Senate 
confirmation—a position, by the way, 
that is one of the most important posi-
tions to my State, the great State of 
Alaska. 
And yet here we are. Here we are. We 
are going to vote for her. And it looks 
like all my Senate Democrat col-
leagues are going to vote aye. Shock-
ing. I hope America is watching be-
cause this is a bigger vote than just for 
the BLM Director. This is a symbol of 
how crazy and far left this administra-
tion has gone and, to be honest, how 
fearful some of my colleagues are of 
that. 
So I was here on the Senate floor a 
little over 1 month ago, and I called on 
the President to withdraw his nomina-
tion to lead the Bureau of Land Man-
agement, Tracy Stone-Manning. It was 
the first time in my Senate career I 
have called on a nominee to be with-
drawn before they had gone through 
their vote on the Senate floor and vote 
out of committee. I have never done 
that before. 
Usually, the President certainly gets 
to put forward who he or she wants for 
positions to fill out his Cabinet and his 
Federal Government. That is normal. 
I have never done this before, but I 
have a reason, just like Senator BAR-
RASSO has been coming down on the 
Senate floor to talk about this, to ac-
tually call for this withdrawal, because 
we have not confronted someone with 
Tracy Stone-Manning’s past, which in-
volves being a member of part of an ex-
treme, radical, violent group that per-
formed violent acts in the name of get-
ting attention, a violent group engag-
ing in overt ecoterrorism. 
Her 
past 
association 
with 
ecoterrorism is so heinous that even 
the Director of BLM from the Obama- 
Biden administration said that her ac-
tions should preclude her from consid-
eration, and her nomination should be 
withdrawn by the President. 
You would think that would have 
been it. The last Democrat nominee for 
that job said she wasn’t qualified be-
cause of her ecoterrorism past. That 
was Mr. Bob Abbey. 
I want to talk about BLM for a 
minute and why I am on the floor 
again talking about this issue. This is 
an incredibly important and powerful 
Federal agency, particularly as it re-
lates to my State. 
The Alaska BLM manages more sur-
face and subsurface acres in my State 
than in any other State in the country, 
by far. In fact, I haven’t done the math 
completely, but I believe they manage 
more acreage in Alaska than they do in 
the rest of the lower 48 combined. That 
is how important this is. 
Let me give you some of the num-
bers. This includes over 70 million sur-
face acres of land and 220 million sub-
surface acres of land in Alaska. That is 
the land equivalent to about one-fifth 
of the entire lower 48 States. Most 
States can’t even comprehend that 
size. That is why this is such an impor-
tant nominee. 
This, of course, is a huge amount of 
land, and it is a huge amount of power 
over my constituents for access to land 
for our economy, for our environment, 
for our Native culture. It is imperative 
the Director of this Agency—and I am 
not going to always agree with the Di-
rector of this Agency—but the Director 
of the BLM, with so much power and so 
much control over Alaska and its fu-
ture and our working families, be 
someone who is, at minimum, trust-
worthy, honest, fair-minded, beyond re-
proach, and certainly—certainly—not 
involved with an organization whose 
mission was to perpetuate violence 
against their fellow Americans. 
Is that so hard a standard? 
This nominee is none of these things. 
As Senator BARRASSO so ably has pre-
sented, and as I mentioned, she was 
once a member of an ecoterrorist orga-
nization. 
Now, maybe she can go work for 
President Biden in some other position, 
but to get Senate-confirmed, given 
what she has done, and have U.S. Sen-
ators look the other way—it is OK. She 
was part of a group that was perpet-
uating acts of violence against their 
fellow Americans to get attention, and 
we are OK with that? U.S. Senators are 
OK with that? My goodness, this is a 
low bar. 
Tracy Stone-Manning was a member 
of Earth First!—a radical, far-left 
group who has engaged repeatedly in 
what is defined as ecoterrorism. She 
wasn’t just a member of Earth First!; 
she was complicit, as Senator BAR-
RASSO
just mentioned, putting big 
metal spikes, thick ones, in trees that 
were meant to either threaten to hurt 
or actually gravely injure Americans, 
working families who were harvesting 
trees in our country legally and who 
were putting trees in sawmills legally. 
This was a common technique—tree

spiking, as it was called—deployed by 
such ecoterrorist groups in the late 
1980s and early 1990s, and it is ex-
tremely dangerous. 
Let me briefly talk about the group 
Tracy Stone-Manning was a member 
of. Again, we know that this adminis-
tration is putting forth far-left nomi-
nees with affiliations with certain 
groups but not violent groups. That 
should be a redline that every Senator 
agrees with. 
Earth First! began in 1980 by dis-
affected 
environmentalists 
who 
thought the movement wasn’t radical 
enough. They thought the environ-
mental movement in America wasn’t 
getting enough attention, so they 
thought, hmm, let’s get more attention 
by perpetrating violence and destruc-
tion. 
The group’s slogan is this: ‘‘No Com-
promise in Defense of Mother Earth.’’ 
In their view, ‘‘no compromise’’ meant 
destroying 
property, 
putting 
steel 
spikes in trees that could kill someone 
trying to harvest a tree, and they even 
celebrated and encouraged such ac-
tions. The group put out a manual— 
yes, a manual—on their ecoterrorist 
tactics detailing tree spiking and in-
structions on how to cause other sabo-
tage: Cut down power lines. Flatten 
tires of vehicles for timber harvesters. 
Burn machinery. Again, these are all 
American citizens who were trying to 
do something legally. 
We harvest trees legally in Alaska. 
We have loggers who have been doing 
this for generations from hard-working 
American families. So many other 
States in this Senate—represented here 
in the Senate. I certainly hope a Sen-
ator from one of those States is not 
going to vote yes in a couple of min-
utes here on this vote. 
David Foreman was the founder of 
Earth First! He talked about these ac-
tivities, and he said: ‘‘This is where the 
ecoteur can have fun.’’ That is a quote 
from the founder of Earth First! This is 
what he called fun. 
This is how an article in the Wash-
ington Post from this time described 
such an incident of tree spiking that 
severely hurt one of our fellow Amer-
ican citizens, and I am going to quote 
from this article: 
George Alexander, a third-generation mill 
worker, was just starting his shift at the 
Louisiana-Pacific lumber mill in Cloverdale, 
Calif., when the log that would alter his life 
rolled down his conveyor belt toward a high- 
speed saw he was working on. 
Now, we have these saws and these 
mills in Alaska. These saws are huge, 
the size of people. They spin at incred-
ibly fast speeds with huge teeth. They 
are dangerous to work on normally, 
but when you think about hitting a 
tree going through a mill with a spike 
in it, you can imagine, it is an explo-
sion. 
Let me continue this article: 
It was May 1987, and [George] Alexander 
was 23 [years old]. His job was to split logs. 
He was nearly three feet away when the log 
[he was working on] hit his saw and the saw 
[this giant saw] exploded. One half of the 
blade stuck in the log. The other half hit 
Alexander in the head [again, these are giant 
saws] tearing through his safety helmet and 
[tearing through his] face shield. His face 
was slashed from eye to chin. His teeth were 
smashed and his jaw was cut in half. 
Good job, Earth First! Good job try-
ing to kill a fellow American. This is 
what Earth First! did. 
I was up on the Yukon River over the 
Fourth of July at our fish camp clean-
ing brush, trees, working a chain saw, 
and I honestly was thinking about this. 
I was thinking, man, I have this saw, a 
little saw, not one of these huge things. 
Think about if you hit a spike. 
But these were the kind of tactics 
that Tracy Stone-Manning, the Biden 
administration’s choice to lead the 
BLM, once conspired in. Does that dis-
turb you, America? Does that disturb 
you, national media? Does that disturb 
you, my fellow Senators? It sure the 
heck disturbs me. Every U.S. Senator 
on the floor here should be very, very 
disturbed about this. 
So what did she specifically do? 
Again, Senator BARRASSO
has high-
lighted this. She hasn’t been truthful 
to the Senate, by the way. That is a 
crime in and of itself. Here is what she 
did. In 1989, she did a fellow friend, an 
Earth First! friend—really a comrade; 
it is more of a socialist Communist or-
ganization—a fellow comrade a favor. 
She rewrote word-for-word a profane, 
anonymous letter—you saw it here 
from Senator BARRASSO
a couple of 
minutes ago—from this Earth First! 
member about the 500 pounds of tree 
spikes that they had hammered into 
trees in an Idaho forest—by Earth 
First!, 500 pounds. That is a lot. 
She rewrote the letter on a rented 
typewriter because, she later told a re-
porter, ‘‘her fingerprints were all over 
it,’’ so she didn’t want to get caught. 
So she knew she was obviously doing 
something criminal. She didn’t just 
handwrite it; she typed it and then sent 
the letter to the FBI. And you saw it is 
a very disturbing, profane letter where 
she threatens people who are going to 
get hurt. So she is all in. She is all in. 
She kept quiet on this for years, and 
that was 1989, until she came forward 
in 1993, received immunity, obviously 
had 
been 
investigated—lied 
about 
that—for her part in this tree spiking 
in Idaho. 
She has since then portrayed herself 
as a victim. But a former criminal in-
vestigator for USDA Forest Service— 
again, Senator BARRASSO
laid this 
out—wrote a letter to the chairman 
and ranking member of the Senate 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources, and here is what he said: 
Ms. Stone-Manning was not an innocent 
bystander, nor was she a victim in this case. 
. . . Ms. Stone-Manning was not only a mem-
ber of Earth First!, but she played an active 
role in the Earth First! hierarchy. 
He described her as vulgar, antago-
nistic, and extremely anti-government. 
He said she was uncooperative and re-
fused to provide hair, handwriting sam-
ples, and fingerprints as ordered by the 
Federal grand jury. Come on, U.S. Sen-
ate, really? You are going to confirm 
her? 
It was only after she knew that she 
might get in trouble that she began to 
cooperate. ‘‘Let me be clear,’’ Special 
Agent Michael Merkley wrote very re-
cently. ‘‘Ms. Stone-Manning only came 
forward after her attorney struck the 
immunity deal, and not before she was 
caught.’’ 
In testimony submitted to the Sen-
ate, she claimed that the tree spiking 
was ‘‘alleged’’ but never investigated. 
That is untrue. None of this is true. 
But here is what is true: She was a 
member of an ecoterrorist group who 
had as its goal to threaten or actually 
hurt Americans. Americans were hurt 
by this, hard-working Americans doing 
something legally. She is clearly dis-
honest, and she has no business head-
ing up the BLM, a Federal Agency with 
enormous power, especially over my 
State. 
So this is a really important issue for 
me, which is why I have been on the 
floor talking about it. As I said, the 
President should have withdrawn her 
nomination, and I certainly hope my 
Senate colleagues will not vote to con-
firm her. I don’t think any Republican 
is going to. But any of my fellow 
Democrats who live in places where 
men and women harvest logs, hard- 
working American families, it is going 
to be really interesting to see how you 
write those families after you vote yes, 
if you do. 
So I hope we defeat her vote here 
today, but I think there is something 
else to talk about. As I mentioned, it is 
one thing to put forward far-left indi-
viduals 
for 
these 
Senate-confirmed 
jobs. It is quite another to put forward 
someone who is far left and violent, 
with a record of trying to hurt your 
fellow Americans. 
I think this is a symbol. We know the 
Biden administration has a lot of allies 
in some of these groups, but the fact 
that the President of the United 
States, with all this evidence that has 
come out—maybe they overlooked it, 
but now it is all out—lying, violence. 
He is still standing behind her, and it 
looks like all my colleagues are going 
to vote for her. This is a travesty. 
I hope all Americans watching ask 
the proper question. Dishonest, lying 
ecoterrorist took action to hurt people, 
who is now going to have one of the 
most important positions of power in 
America over my constituents. We 
need to do better here, folks. If she 
passes, this is going to show just how 
far left the Biden administration is. 
Again, I try to be bipartisan here. I 
have a lot of friends on both sides of 
the aisle. But how compliant or scared 
my Senate Democratic colleagues are 
of these radical groups. 
Do the right thing, vote no on this 
nominee, and get the President to put 
forward someone else without a violent 
past who has been honest. We might 
disagree with them. But to my Senate 
Democratic colleagues today, do the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
because of the increase in hospitaliza-
tions because of the Delta variant of 
the virus, we are told that the CDC will 
soon be requiring, in about half the 
counties of the country, masks and 
other restrictions to prevent the spread 
of the virus. 
They say they are doing it because of 
the science. We are told they will not 
show us the data. The very essence of 
science is peer review, and pity any-
body who wants to analyze it. In Amer-
ica, the public’s business ought to be 
public. 
If we can’t get this data, what the 
taxpayers are paying for and public 
policy is being made on, it seems to me 
that principle—that the public’s busi-
ness is not really public. And when peo-
ple are able to cover up things and 
make policy decisions that are not pub-
lic and transparent, it obviously brings 
about less accountability. 
So let’s have that data. We want to 
know why you are requiring masks 
again. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Madam President, today, I join my 
colleagues to mourn the passing of my 
friend, former Senator Mike Enzi. 
Just a few months ago, Mike stood 
here in this very Chamber, on Decem-
ber 22, to say farewell to this institu-
tion and his colleagues. After 24 years, 
the people of his beloved State—serv-
ing them—he returned home to Wyo-
ming. 
To the good people of Wyoming, I 
thank you for sharing Mike with us for 
a couple of dozen years. He was a guid-
ing light here in the U.S. Senate. He 
worked effectively to find common 
ground and bridge partisan divide for 
the public good. 
Mike practiced, by word and by deed, 
the mission statement that he created 
for his office: Do what is right; do our 
best; and treat others as they wish to 
be treated. 
In his farewell speech here on the 
Senate floor, he told us about the 80- 
percent tool as an effective way to gov-
ern. Mike was a pragmatist. He under-
stood good laws aren’t made with a 
sledgehammer. It takes craftsmanship, 
consensus, and common sense. As Mike 
said, focus on the 80 percent of an issue 
where we can find agreement and then 
discard the other 20 percent. 
Today, as Congress seeks to reach 
consensus on a host of important 
issues, we would do well to follow 
Mike’s advice. We need more of that bi-
partisan buy-in that Mike brought 
from his State of Wyoming to Wash-
ington, DC, and the Halls of Congress. 
I was honored to partner on so many 
bread-and-butter issues that had a di-
rect impact on hard-working families, 
farmers, breadwinners, and small busi-
nesses. 
As many of you know, I help on our 
family farm in New Hartford, IA. Mike 
started and ran a family-owned shoe 
store in Gillette, his home there in Wy-
oming. Meeting payroll, paying bills, 
and making ends meet informed in 
each of us a philosophy about govern-
ment spending and conservative man-
agement of the taxpayers’ money. As 
disciples of fiscal discipline, we evan-
gelized, caucused, and fought together 
to hold the line on reckless spending. 
Too many people in Washington for-
get that taxpayers’ dollars don’t grow 
on trees. It is the people’s money. Mike 
knew how to crunch numbers and 
watch over the Federal purse better 
than all of us. He was an accountant 
and put his expertise to work as chair-
man of the Senate Budget Committee. 
He held the Federal bureaucracy to ac-
count and kept Congress accountable 
to the American people. 
Reelected by wide margins, Mike rel-
ished retail politics and fought for 
small businesses and retailers at the 
policymaking tables. Barbara and I 
traveled to Gillette once to attend a 
political event with Mike and his wife 
Diana. The feeling in the crowd was in-
sightful; the Enzis are beloved in Wyo-
ming. 
Mike kept in touch with the grass-
roots, traveling Wyoming as exten-
sively as I travel to every corner of 
Iowa. However, he always made time to 
foster 
relationships 
with 
friends, 
former staff, and, of course, his family. 
I don’t often socialize in Washington, 
but I made an exception for my friend 
Mike Enzi. I joined the Enzis’ weekly 
Tortilla Coast dinner when I could. My 
wife Barbara joined every chance she 
had, and she did it much more often 
than I did. 
On each Senator’s birthday, Mike 
would write a long, heartfelt birthday 
note with a personal P.S. I looked for-
ward to reading his birthday wish 
every year and the advice—very good 
advice—that he included in it. There 
was always a piece of advice or a chal-
lenge for the year ahead. 
Mike was humble. Mike was ap-
proachable. Mike was respected by all. 
He was a true friend of this Senate. I 
recall those parting words from the 
gentle giant of Gillette, WY: I like 
being a Senator, not for the title, not 
for the recognition, and certainly not 
for the publicity. I like solving Federal 
problems for Wyoming people. I like 
doing legislation. 
And, of course, Mike did just that. 
Barbara and I extend our heartfelt 
sympathy to Diana and his children as 
well. May God bless Mike, a faithful 
servant of the Lord. And we saw that 
faithfulness to the Lord as he led the 
Wednesday 
morning 
Senate 
prayer 
meeting on a very regular basis. And 
may He bring you and your family 
peace and comfort, today and always. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, on another note, 
on June 8 of this year, I sent a letter— 
I came to the floor, I should say in-
stead, to speak about my oversight ac-
tivities with respect to the origins of 
the coronavirus. As part of that over-
sight, on March 8 and May 26 of this 
year, I wrote to the Department of 
Health and Human Services about its 
oversight of grants sent to EcoHealth 
Alliance. 
The Department sent millions of dol-
lars to EcoHealth. That group then 
subawarded hundreds of thousands of 
dollars of that taxpayer money to the 
Wuhan Institute of Virology. Reports 
have indicated that $600,000 to $826,000 
was sent to the Wuhan Institute of Vi-
rology. 
So, folks, what we have here is tax-
payer money that was sent to the com-
munist Chinese Government. That is a 
pretty scary proposition. When we send 
taxpayers’ money to the Chinese Gov-
ernment, if there is no oversight done 
on that money, then we really don’t 
have any idea how it is used. Just look 
at the news about China kicking the 
French out of the Wuhan laboratory. 
China can’t be trusted, period. But I 
am not sure bureaucrats share that 
same view. I am talking about bureau-
crats of our government. To illustrate, 
Dr. Anthony Fauci has said that Chi-
nese scientists are trustworthy; that 
‘‘we [really] always trust the grantee 
to do what they say.’’ 
As a threshold matter, if a govern-
ment worker doesn’t show at least a 
little bit of skepticism about how a 
grant recipient is using the taxpayers’ 
money, they aren’t doing their job. 
That skepticism is healthy, and it is 
basic good government to question the 
recipient to make sure that they are 
doing what they are supposed to do 
with our money. 
Dr. Fauci has also stated that the 
National Institutes of Health ‘‘has not 
ever and does not now fund gain-of- 
function research in the Wuhan Insti-
tute of Virology.’’ That is a pretty con-
fident statement. 
When my colleague Senator PAUL 
questioned Dr. Fauci on his position 
with respect to gain-of-function re-
search, that same Dr. Fauci called my 
colleague a liar. Well, the way I see it, 
the only way that Dr. Fauci and the 
government can be so confident that no 
gain-of-function research was done is if 
they performed the proper oversight of 
the American taxpayers’ money sent to 
China. 
In both my letters to the Department 
of Health and Human Services, I asked 
that very question. So far, the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
has failed to answer the question. 
On June 10 of this year at the Senate 
Finance Committee hearing, I asked 
Secretary Becerra what, if any, over-
sight was done. He didn’t give me an 
answer. I asked again in a followup 
question for the record—still no re-
sponse, even though all these people 
that come before a committee for nom-
ination approval always say: We will 
answer your letters; we will answer the 
phone; we will testify. But no answer 
to that question yet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5085 
July 27, 2021 
The Director of the National Insti-
tutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, 
has also been silent on what, if any, 
oversight was done on the grants to the 
Wuhan Institute of Virology. Dr. Fauci 
has been silent on what, if any, over-
sight he did. 
This is a simple and very important 
question for the government to answer. 
In other words, as you heard me say a 
few minutes ago, the public’s business 
ought to be public. And without that 
sort of transparency, we don’t have ac-
countability, and we are entitled to 
have accountability on this kind of 
money. 
The more that they deny the U.S. 
Congress an answer, the more it looks 
like these bureaucrats don’t give a lick 
about the American people: the people 
they work for, the people who pay their 
salary. 
Dr. Fauci is all over television and 
radio. You name it, he is on it. But, ap-
parently, he and his counterparts can’t 
find enough time to answer this very 
simple question: Did you do any over-
sight of the taxpayers’ money you sent 
to EcoHealth, money that you knew 
was going to the communist Chinese 
Government? If so, please explain; if 
not, why not? 
This should not be a difficult ques-
tion to answer. Either you did or you 
didn’t, and, either way, the American 
people deserve an explanation. And if 
they didn’t do any oversight, then how 
can they confidently say the money 
wasn’t used for gain-of-function re-
search or other bad conduct? 
We have lost over 600,000 Americans, 
and this body has spent trillions of dol-
lars to support our economy and fight 
the virus. Congress and the American 
people have an absolute right to know 
what Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins did to 
oversee this money. Enough with the 
games. Just answer the question. 
I understand that the Department of 
Health and Human Services Office of 
Inspector General is doing an audit of 
what, if any, oversight was done. They 
are supposed to be taking a deep dive 
on the grants, the cooperative arrange-
ments, and other relationships the gov-
ernment had with EcoHealth Alliance. 
The audit isn’t just focused on what 
the National Institutes of Health did or 
didn’t do to monitor the grants. The 
scope also includes what EcoHealth did 
or didn’t do to manage the funds in ac-
cordance with Federal requirements. 
And the scope of that review, at least 
right now, is from 2014 to 2021. 
I expect the inspector general to be 
aggressive and unrelenting in getting 
the 
records, 
the 
emails, 
and 
the 
memos; run the transcribed interviews 
and question everyone up the leader-
ship chain; leave no stone unturned; 
and make as much as possible public. 
If punches are pulled, then this IG 
audit will be a waste of everybody’s 
time and taxpayers’ money. The in-
spector general has a tremendous re-
sponsibility to get this job done right. 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
Madam President, my last point that 
I want to make, fourth and last point, 
I should say, is on a major issue facing 
our Nation, the issue of domestic ter-
rorism and the threat it brings to our 
cities and communities across the 
country. 
On June 15 of this year, the National 
Security Council issued a national 
strategy for countering domestic ter-
rorism. Although the strategic objec-
tives were very similar to the National 
Security Council strategy under the 
Trump administration, I was very con-
cerned to see that the policy took a 
partisan tone. For example, aside from 
the commonsense measures to combat 
crime, such as promoting cooperation 
between 
law 
enforcement 
agencies, 
there was an emphasis on promoting 
gun control and critical race theory in 
schools. 
The Biden administration seems to 
make these recommendations at every 
turn. What the report was missing, I 
found shocking. The report was lacking 
any strategy to combat anarchist ex-
tremism. Specifically, there was no 
mention of the 500 domestic terrorism 
investigations that were open through-
out the 2020 riots. Those 500 cases 
amount to about 25 percent of the 
FBI’s current domestic terrorism in-
vestigations. 
How could the cause of 25 percent of 
the current FBI caseload not be men-
tioned? 
It is a grave mistake to make an 
issue like domestic terrorism partisan, 
even in the slightest. Judging by the 
report, I am afraid that is exactly what 
the administration is doing. 
It is of critical importance to keep in 
mind the great bipartisan work that 
can and should be done to address do-
mestic terrorism of all types—right-
wing and leftwing, including an anar-
chist extremism. We have to work to-
gether on diving deeper into serious, 
apolitical solutions to this issue. It is 
pretty simple. The American people de-
serve it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to use a prop 
during my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to join my colleagues in op-
posing the motion to discharge Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee to lead the Bu-
reau 
of 
Land 
Management, 
Tracy 
Stone-Manning. 
Since 
Ms. 
Stone-Manning’s 
first 
hearing in the beginning of June, mem-
bers of the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee have gathered copi-
ous amounts of information regarding 
a number of controversies that dis-
qualify her for this important role 
within our Federal Government. 
As has been highlighted today, Ms. 
Stone-Manning was involved in a tree- 
spiking plot as a member of the 
ecoterrorist group Earth First!—a tree- 
spiking plot. 
I have to tell you, I didn’t know what 
tree spiking was until a couple of 
weeks ago. 
Could you imagine taking this nail 
and driving it into a tree with the 
hopes it would deter that tree from 
ever being cut down? 
And the concern is, someone that 
would 
take 
a 
chain 
saw, 
cutting 
through that tree, when they would hit 
this spike, what would happen? 
I, unfortunately, had to take care of 
more than one chain saw situation in 
the emergency room. Let me tell you 
about a chain saw accident. The chain 
doesn’t cut the flesh; it tears the flesh 
apart. It tears the skin apart, the mus-
cles apart. It grabs the tendon and lit-
erally wraps them around the chain 
saw, usually permanently maiming 
people. 
So could you imagine, if a chain saw 
hit this spike, what would happen? 
Again, I have ran a chain saw before, 
and I know, as you are running the 
chain saw and you hit something solid, 
something 
hard—a 
knot—sometimes 
that chain saw bounces. It bounces 
back into your body. And that is where 
most of the accidents occur. 
So could you imagine, if that chain 
saw hit this spike, the chain saw is 
going to bounce back, going to recoil 
into the person’s body, and turns this 
spike into a piece of shrapnel? 
This Earth First! Ms. Stone was a 
member of is a radical organization 
that spanned the late 1980s and early 
1990s, during the peak years of what is 
often referred to as ‘‘the wilderness 
wars.’’ As described by the Wall Street 
Journal, Earth First! had, at the time, 
‘‘defined itself’’—and I should quote 
here, ‘‘defined itself as the tip of the fa-
natical spear,’’ and Ms. Stone-Manning 
was referred to as ‘‘an Earth First! 
spokesperson.’’ 
Debuting in 1985, the group engaged 
in a number of protests over the expan-
sion of certain campgrounds and street 
theater asking people to take oaths to 
protect the Earth. However, they grad-
uated into violence and ecoterrorist ac-
tivities, including arson, equipment de-
struction, and the dangerous practice 
of tree spiking, which mangles saws 
and can easily result in the death of 
loggers. 
In 1989, Ms. Stone-Manning was in-
volved in an incident of tree spiking 
herself. Despite her denial, she was 
aware of the act being carried out, 
aided those who were involved, and 
helped cover it up. She obstructed the 
investigation and, finally, traded testi-
mony for immunity. 
At a time when the Biden adminis-
tration has declared domestic extre-
mism as one of the biggest threats the 
United States faces today, how can the 
President nominate someone with a 
record like this to lead the Agency 
that governs one-eighth of the coun-
try’s landmass? How can this body 
bring her confirmation vote to the 
floor? 
It is reckless and dripping with hy-
pocrisy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5086 
July 27, 2021 
Republican Members who have come 
to the floor today are not the only in-
dividuals who believe she is unfit for 
this role. President Obama’s first Bu-
reau of Land Management Director, 
Bobby Abbey, who led the Agency from 
2009 to 2012, said last month that Ms. 
Stone-Manning should withdraw her 
nomination due to her involvement in 
the tree-spiking case. 
Steve Ellis, who served as Deputy Di-
rector of BLM under President Obama, 
joined Mr. Abbey last week in express-
ing his concern about Ms. Stone- 
Manning’s 
nomination, 
stating 
the 
leader of the BLM must—again, I 
quote—‘‘be respected by career employ-
ees and across the landscape, in both 
blue and red states’’ in order to be ef-
fective. 
In addition to her involvement with 
Earth First! and this horrific tree-spik-
ing incident, Ms. Stone-Manning had a 
questionable financial history during 
her time serving in government. Dur-
ing the lengthy hearing process, I was 
alarmed to learn that Ms. Stone-Man-
ning received a $100,000 loan from a 
Montana land developer and Demo-
cratic donor when she worked as a con-
gressional staffer. Senate Ethics rules 
and Federal statute prohibit Senate 
staff from accepting gifts greater than 
$250, including a loan, unless a waiver 
is granted. 
By Ms. Stone-Manning’s own admis-
sion, she did not consult with Senate 
Ethics about the loan, she did not dis-
close the loan to the Senate Ethics 
Committee, she did not seek a written 
determination that the personal friend-
ship exemption applied, and she did not 
receive a written determination that 
the personal friendship exemption ap-
plied. 
Unfortunately, Ms. Stone-Manning 
has also been unable to provide any 
written documentation of the terms of 
the loan, the schedule of payments, the 
actual payments, or any other relevant 
documents. We can only rely on con-
tradictory statements from the hearing 
and her vague responses to our ques-
tions submitted for the record. Many of 
her answers only lead to further ques-
tions about the legality and morality 
of accepting such a large loan. 
Due to the radical nature of many of 
President Biden’s nominees, the major-
ity leader has been forced to bring six 
motions to discharge to the floor in 
order to clear them from the com-
mittee. 
Under the previous power-sharing ar-
rangements, which lasted for 5 months 
during the 107th Congress, there were 
no instances where Majority Leader 
Trent Lott had to utilize a motion to 
discharge. With at least four other 
nominees having received a tie in com-
mittee and their nomination failing to 
be reported favorably, this practice is 
becoming commonplace under this ad-
ministration. 
Ms. 
Stone-Manning’s 
record of dishonesty should be unac-
ceptable and is one of my many issues 
that should make rational people ques-
tion her integrity in a position of 
power. I encourage all Members of this 
body to reject this motion to discharge 
and this radical nominee. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President and fel-
low Senators, I rise today to join the 
chorus of my colleagues that are urg-
ing that Tracy Stone-Manning not be 
confirmed and, indeed, not even be dis-
charged from the committee that voted 
to not send her to the floor for con-
firmation. 
First of all, it is amazing to me that 
someone with this background has 
been appointed to this position. Now, I 
understand she has held some positions 
in the State of Montana for politicians 
there, and I don’t comment on that. 
That is up to them, who they want the 
hire to do that. 
In Idaho, that has a very, very sig-
nificant number of acres of BLM 
ground, we have a different view of how 
our public resources should be pro-
tected and be administered, and this 
appointee in no way reflects the values 
we have. 
This woman is an ecoterrorist. She 
participated in a conspiracy to murder 
people who work in the timber indus-
try for a living. She is a perjurer, very 
recently. And she is someone who is 
supposed to put out fires and, as late as 
2020, has made very disqualifying state-
ments regarding her desire to do that 
and, indeed, commitment to do that. 
Let’s start with the ecoterrorist 
charge. I want to go a little bit further 
than what my colleague who just spoke 
did about using a chain saw to tear 
down—or to take down a tree in the 
forest. 
Let me explain to you how this 
works. The prop that he held up was a 
spike that ecoterrorists put in trees. 
There is one reason to put a spike in a 
tree—one reason and one reason only— 
and that is to kill and to maim the 
people who harvest that tree. 
These are innocent people who are in-
volved in the timber business. They are 
my friends. They are my neighbors. We 
have lots of them in Idaho, and they 
work in a dangerous industry anyway. 
But for someone to go out and inten-
tionally put these spikes in the trees, 
as the Senator spoke before me, Sen-
ator MARSHALL mentioned, there can 
be an injury in the forest when you are 
actually cutting the tree with a chain 
saw. 
But that isn’t the main difficulty 
with this. The main difficulty is when 
it hits the mill. They cut these logs up 
into mill-sized pieces and then run 
them through the mill, which is cut ei-
ther with a circular saw or band saw 
into boards. And when that happens, 
the log and saw move very quickly 
through the log and cut up the wood 
into timber, which is not a problem un-
less there is a spike in the way. If there 
is a spike in the way, somebody in that 
mill will be badly injured and/or killed. 
When that saw hits the spike, the 
saw shatters, the spike shatters, and it 
sends shrapnel to everybody who is 
standing within the vicinity. It has 
happened. It is documented. And it is 
ugly. 
So when ecoterrorists do this, this is 
not a Sunday school prank. This is an 
act knowingly, willfully, intentionally 
with a black and abandoned heart com-
mitted in order to murder someone 
who works in the timber industry. This 
is wrong. 
The person that we are voting on 
today participated in a conspiracy to 
do just that. Indeed, she wrote a letter. 
She claims she just typed it. Origi-
nally, she said it was handed to her by 
some person and asked to type. We now 
find out, of course, that this was a let-
ter that was composed by a number of 
people, not the least of which was a 
gentleman that she lived with; but she 
is the one who put this together and 
sent it to the Federal Government as 
part of this act of conspiring, to take 
the lives of innocent people in the for-
est. 
She says she edited the letter. But if 
she did, then it is what it is in front of 
us. She said she typed this and sent it 
to the Forest Service. 
She said: This letter is being sent to 
you to notify that the Post Office sale 
in Idaho has been spiked heavily. The 
project required that 11 of us spend 9 
days in God-awful weather conditions 
spiking trees. We unloaded a total of 
500 pounds of spikes, measuring 8 to 10 
inches, et cetera, et cetera. 
Well, if she edited this letter, then 
she properly stated what her participa-
tion was in all of this. And there is no 
question that she admits that she pre-
pared this letter and sent it to the For-
est Service. 
Today, in Idaho, those spikes remain 
in the trees. We don’t know when one 
of those logs is going to be cut and 
going to cause damage, possibly the 
loss of life, but certainly the maiming 
of people who attempt to process that 
log into usable lumber. She says they 
put 500 pounds total of spikes in those 
trees. 
This is a person whom the adminis-
tration has chosen to administer the 
largest chunk of Federal land in the 
United States of America, possibly in 
the world. She is going to manage 
these after she committed this act of 
ecoterrorism and participated in this 
conspiracy. 
Now, you say: Why isn’t she in pris-
on? Well, her coconspirators went to 
prison because she testified against 
them. She was found out. The inves-
tigators determined what her partici-
pation was in the conspiracy. She hired 
an attorney, and the attorney nego-
tiated a deal where she would rat on 
the fellow conspirators and she did so 
and thereby avoided going to prison. 
So that is what happened in her prior 
history. It is important to know those 
things because somewhere down in the 
recesses of her heart and her soul, she 
was prepared to participate in a con-
spiracy that would cause the death and 
the injury of innocent forest workers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5087 
July 27, 2021 
Now, more recently than that, she 
has made statements that certainly 
call into considerable question how she 
will be able to do her job. For those of 
you who don’t live in the Western 
States, as I do and many of us do, when 
public land starts on fire, it is impor-
tant that the fire be put out and be put 
out as quickly as possible. Her husband 
wrote an article. I wouldn’t ordinarily 
tag her with her husband’s view of 
things, but she took that article; she 
republished it in 2020 and said this was 
a ‘‘clarion call.’’ Now, if you look up 
‘‘clarion call’’ in the dictionary, it is 
an urgent call to require somebody to 
do something. She calls this a clarion 
call. 
He wrote this article about how peo-
ple shouldn’t be building in the forest 
around what is called interface land. If 
you are not—again, we westerners are 
familiar with interface. We have so 
much public land that many of our sub-
divisions, our individual homes, our 
cities butt up against interface land. 
So this is what she said was a clarion 
call. The solution to houses in the 
interface is to let them burn. This is 
the person that the administration is 
going to put in charge of fire suppres-
sion in an interface zone. Let me state 
it again. The solution to houses in the 
interface zone is to let them burn is 
what she said. 
Then: How do you feel about that? 
She said: 
There’s a rude and satisfying justice in 
burning down the House of someone who 
builds in the forest. 
That was in 2020. In 2020, she said 
that. This is whom the administration 
wants to take over the Bureau of Land 
Management. 
Well, in addition to that, she lied to 
the committee. She lied under oath. I 
will tell you, this is disgusting. She 
shouldn’t be here. She should be 
charged and standing in front of a jury. 
Now, I told you what she did about 
her participation in the tree-spiking 
incident, and this was a question that 
was asked of her under oath as she 
came to the committee for her con-
firmation: 
Did you have personal knowledge of, par-
ticipate in, or in any way directly or indi-
rectly support activities associated with the 
spiking of trees in any forest during your 
lifetime? 
No. 
Now, we know she wrote this letter. 
She admits it. She participated in it 
because she testified she participated 
in it when she testified against the 
other people who were eventually con-
victed and sent to prison. Yet she 
swore under oath to our committee 
this year that, no, she wasn’t involved 
in that. They asked: Have you ever 
been arrested or charged—they asked 
her whether or not she had ever been a 
target of such an investigation. She 
says: 
No, I have never been arrested or charged 
and to my knowledge I have never been the 
target of such investigation. 
She knew she was a target; she was 
sent a letter that she was a target; and 
she hired an attorney to get her out 
from underneath that mess because she 
was a target. Yet she said no. So she 
has perjured herself this year. 
Well, look, this is not the right per-
son for this job. It just amazes me that 
they would even consider a person like 
this for this job. This is an insult to 
the thousands of good, hard-working 
people who are in the Bureau of Land 
Management and who work day and 
night to protect our resources on the 
public lands in the Western States. 
Look, I know we are going to lose 
this. It is going to be a party-line vote. 
All Republicans are going to vote 
against confirming her. The Democrats 
are all going to vote in favor of her. I 
say to this administration, this is not 
going to go away. This person’s record 
of perjury, of ecoterrorism, of partici-
pating as a person involved in this plot 
and this conspiracy to actually take 
the life of Forest Service workers—this 
is not going to go away during the en-
tire time that she is the head of this 
Agency. It is going to come up again 
and again, and it should. 
So I say to my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, I say to the President 
of the United States, who has nomi-
nated her for this position, if this is 
the character of someone who you 
want us to remember as the legacy of 
your administration, here she is, a per-
jurer, an ecoterrorist, a person who has 
participated in a conspiracy to murder 
innocent people working in the forest. 
If that is what you want as your ad-
ministration, here it is. Vote for it. I 
suspect that is exactly what is going to 
happen, but this is not going to go 
away. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to join my colleagues in ex-
pressing my grave concern over the 
nomination of Ms. Tracy Stone-Man-
ning to be the Director of the Bureau 
of Land Management. 
The Office of the Director of the Bu-
reau of Land Management is tasked 
with an enormous responsibility. As it 
manages an eighth of our Nation’s 
land, its leadership should be held to 
the highest standards. 
Every nominee referred to the En-
ergy and Natural Resources Committee 
must complete and submit the state-
ment for completion by Presidential 
nominees, which is the standard com-
mittee questionnaire. In the sworn 
statement, Ms. Stone-Manning told the 
committee that she has never been ar-
rested or charged and, to her knowl-
edge, has never been the target of an 
investigation. 
Unfortunately, as many of us are now 
aware, Ms. Stone-Manning’s responses 
were not forthcoming nor fully accu-
rate. 
I am particularly disturbed by Ms. 
Stone-Manning’s involvement with the 
ecoterrorist organization Earth First!, 
which organized the tree-spiking plot 
in Idaho. As you all may know, tree 
spiking involves hammering a metal or 
ceramic rod into a tree trunk in order 
to prevent loggers from harvesting the 
timber. If the saw makes contact with 
a spike, it can result in severe injury 
or even the logger’s death. 
Make no mistake, the people who put 
these spikes into the trees are well 
aware of the potential consequences of 
their actions. These schemes are car-
ried out with intent to harm or even, 
at the very least, the intent to frighten 
the loggers who are carrying out their 
daily jobs. 
I want to be clear, no one is claiming 
that Ms. Stone-Manning put any spikes 
in any trees herself. However, it is un-
disputed that Ms. Stone-Manning as-
sisted the people who did. 
Ms. Stone-Manning wrote a letter 
laced with vulgarities to the U.S. For-
est Service, threatening loggers who 
were simply carrying out their jobs, 
doing what they do for a living. 
In the aftermath of this tree-spiking 
conspiracy, Ms. Stone-Manning was in-
vestigated and subpoenaed by a Federal 
grand jury. Ms. Stone-Manning was si-
lent about her involvement in the plot, 
but when new evidence came to light 4 
years later, she struck a deal for im-
munity in 1993. 
Tracy Stone-Manning’s involvement 
in ecoterrorism as well as her dishon-
esty to the Senate is more than alarm-
ing. There are questions that need to 
be revisited and answered. The state-
ments from the former lead investi-
gator of the Idaho tree-spiking scheme 
as well as the actions of the Federal 
grand jury tell a different tale than 
what Ms. Stone-Manning led the com-
mittee to believe. These discrepancies 
must not be cast aside. 
I am concerned about the precedent 
that will be set for future nominees if 
my colleagues simply agree to accept 
or disregard these inconsistencies. 
I am very disappointed that my 
Democratic colleagues on the Energy 
Committee moved forward with Ms. 
Stone-Manning’s 
nomination. 
There 
are serious unanswered questions about 
her voracity and her qualifications to 
lead. 
I applaud my colleagues who have 
sought the truth, and I am disheart-
ened that those efforts have met with 
resistance. The American people de-
serve transparency. I cannot support 
this nominee, and I would urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to use a prop dur-
ing my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, in 1989, 
Tracy Stone-Manning rented a type-
writer to draft and then send a letter 
threatening those who might choose to 
harvest trees. The letter stated that 
the trees in question had been sabo-
taged with hundreds of pounds of 
spikes. She closed the letter with:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5088 
July 27, 2021 
‘‘You bastards go in there anyway,’’ 
meaning notwithstanding her threat, 
‘‘and a lot of people could get hurt.’’ 
She and her cohorts thus used the 
threat of physical violence to achieve a 
political goal. This is the definition of 
terrorism. 
In 1993, multiple associates of Ms. 
Stone-Manning were convicted of tree 
spiking by a Federal jury. Though she 
signed and swore that the information 
provided to the committee was ‘‘to the 
best of [her] knowledge and belief, cur-
rent, accurate, and complete,’’ Ms. 
Stone-Manning told the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee that she 
had never been investigated. 
This was, in fact, not true. It was 
widely reported that in 1990, Ms. Stone- 
Manning was required to give hair sam-
ples, a full set of fingerprints, and writ-
ing samples. This was already a year 
after she had conspired with her circle 
of friends, members of the radical envi-
ronmentalist group Earth First!. She 
was still not cooperating with the au-
thorities. 
Now, how do we know that she was, 
in fact, a target of the investigation 
and not simply a bystander? Well, we 
know that based on a letter from Mi-
chael Merkley, a retired special agent 
criminal investigator for the Forest 
Service. He writes the following: 
[The witness] described how Ms. Stone- 
Manning typed and mailed the letter to the 
Forest Service. She also recounted a con-
versation she had overheard wherein Ms. 
Stone-Manning along with other co-conspira-
tors planned the tree spiking and discussed 
whether to use ceramic or metal spikes in 
the trees. 
As a result of [the witness’s] testimony, 
the grand jury sent Ms. Stone-Manning a 
‘‘target letter’’ which meant she was going 
to be indicted on criminal charges for her ac-
tive participation in planning these crimes. 
She hired an attorney who negotiated a deal 
with an Assistant United States Attorney to 
gain immunity in exchange for her testi-
mony against the other defendants. 
Ms. Stone-Manning did not gain im-
munity simply for being a good person 
or a model citizen. No, she traded her 
knowledge after withholding it for 
years. This is verified by her own ad-
mission in the May 21, 1993, edition of 
the Missoulian, reading: 
Stone-Manning said she could have been 
charged with conspiracy . . . were it not for 
the agreement she reached with the U.S. at-
torney. 
Furthermore, she received a target 
letter, meaning she knew very well 
that she had been under investigation. 
This is a direct contradiction of a 
sworn statement that she made to the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee on which I serve, so she de-
liberately misled U.S. Senators. Unfor-
tunately, Ms. Stone-Manning has been 
able to deceive a lot of people. Even a 
White 
House 
official 
acknowledged 
that this was a ‘‘massive vetting fail-
ure.’’ 
So what exactly did this tree spiking 
involve? Well, it involved spikes like 
these, spikes made of steel that, when 
placed into a tree, can cause wide-
spread damage to those harvesting the 
trees, those milling the trees. They 
have maimed many and wounded many 
others as a result of radical environ-
mentalists taking this tactic to try to 
stop the harvesting of timber on Fed-
eral lands. 
Now, regardless of how you may feel 
about timber-harvesting policy on Fed-
eral lands, I think all Americans of 
good faith and conscience can agree 
that it is not a good idea to use ter-
rorism to advance your goals and that 
it is not a good idea to use threats of 
physical violence and present people 
with a real, foreseeable, and, in fact, 
foreseen and intended risk that they 
will be harmed or could even die as a 
result of the 500 pounds of these tree 
spikes that they placed in the trees in 
question. 
So, yes, the White House admitted 
that this was a vetting failure, and a 
vetting failure it was. It was either a 
vetting failure or no one at the admin-
istration cared when Tracy Stone-Man-
ning tweeted out only months ago an 
article written by her husband, an arti-
cle that itself states: ‘‘There’s a rude 
and satisfying justice in burning down 
the house of someone who builds in the 
forest.’’ 
When she tweeted out this story, ap-
parently with her approval, she called 
it a clarion call—her words, not mine— 
seeming almost to celebrate their mis-
fortune, to revel in the misery and loss 
of those who had just had their homes 
destroyed, oftentimes as a result of 
chronic mismanagement on Federal 
lands in allowing fuel to build up and 
remain untreated. 
There are plenty of homes in forests 
in Utah. I presume that there are plen-
ty of homes elsewhere—that there are 
plenty of homes in Arizona, in Mon-
tana, in California, in Colorado, in Ne-
vada, in West Virginia, and elsewhere. 
So I would ask the question: How can 
we entrust the responsibility to protect 
the homes of those Americans who live 
on or near a forest from forest fire to 
an individual who actively advocated 
only months ago for their demise and 
who, apparently, celebrated their de-
mise? 
Lastly and, perhaps, most heinously, 
revelations have also come out regard-
ing research that she conducted for her 
thesis. In 1992, Tracy Stone-Manning 
published her graduate student thesis 
at the University of Montana, entitled 
‘‘Into the Heart of the Beast: A Case 
for Environmental Advertising,’’ which 
espoused several radical views on popu-
lation and grazing. 
In this thesis, she published a photo 
of a child with the caption—this photo 
with this caption right here. It has a 
picture of a young child, a toddler. 
‘‘Can you find the environmental haz-
ard in this photo?’’ She then indicated 
that the child—this baby—was the en-
vironmental hazard. 
She then elaborates: 
Americans believe that overpopulation is 
only a problem somewhere else in the world. 
But it’s a problem here too. . . . We breed 
more than any other industrialized nation. 
At the same time, we suck up one-third of 
the world’s energy. . . . When we over-
populate, the earth notices it more. Stop at 
two. It could be the best thing you do for the 
planet. . . . Do the truly smart thing. Stop 
at one or two kids. 
This is a fringe belief. It is a dan-
gerous belief. Not only is it factually 
flawed, but it is morally repugnant. As 
a father of three, I am repulsed, 
ashamed, and saddened. As much as 
anything, as the resident of a State, 
two-thirds of which is owned by the 
Federal Government and 40 percent of 
which is under the direct management 
and control of the Bureau of Land Man-
agement, the entity that she has been 
nominated to head, I am mortified that 
she is going to be in charge of all of 
that land, because this is how she 
views human beings. 
We should all accept the fact that 
human beings are assets; they are 
blessings. They are not liabilities. Chil-
dren are beautiful gifts from Heaven 
above, not environmental hazards. 
I have consistently voiced outrage at 
China’s one-child policy, and we are 
here today, voting on a nominee who 
calls for a similar action—telling par-
ents in the most condescending tone 
imaginable: ‘‘Stop at one or two kids.’’ 
According to Ms. Stone-Manning, we 
are simply breeding too much. 
So now we must ask ourselves: Will 
this body advance the nomination of a 
person who played a central role in en-
dangering the lives of foresters and 
sawmillers, who engaged in acts of 
reckless and deliberately harmful envi-
ronmental 
terrorism 
in 
using 
500 
pounds of tree spikes, who attempted 
to deceive Members of the U.S. Senate 
about these same violent actions, who 
has advocated for homes to be left to 
burn in the wilderness, indicating that 
she would celebrate when that hap-
pened, and who has called children an 
environmental hazard? 
The Director of the Bureau of Land 
Management, the position that Ms. 
Stone-Manning has been nominated to 
fill, has immense discretionary power. 
This isn’t simply a matter that is con-
cerning for symbolic reasons. It is that, 
too, but far more than that. If con-
firmed to this position, she is going to 
have immense discretionary power. 
Could we rest knowing that she was 
at the helm of the Bureau of Land 
Management, making decisions about 
grazing, wildfire response, wildfire pre-
vention, suppression, and rehabilita-
tion and everything else that the Bu-
reau of Land Management is charged 
with? I could not. I cannot and I will 
not. So I urge my colleagues to reject 
her nomination. 
I yield the floor.

PHY). The Senator from Montana.

S5089 
July 27, 2021 
Stone-Manning, may not have person-
ally spiked trees—that is what the 
facts have shown as we have inves-
tigated—but she covered up a terri-
fying tree-spiking crime until she faced 
possible prosecution. 
For many who are watching, what is 
tree spiking? I think it is very impor-
tant to know that these are these large 
spikes that ecoterrorists put into trees 
for the purposes of injuring loggers or 
sawmill operators. When the blade goes 
through it, when the blade strikes 
these large spikes, the blade explodes 
like a grenade, causing serious injury 
to sawmill operators or loggers. 
For 4 years, she refused to tell Fed-
eral investigators who the perpetrators 
were—the time from 1989 to 1993—even 
though she knew and had every oppor-
tunity to tell it. This happened in my 
home State. The actual spiking was in 
Idaho, but when the Feds were doing 
the investigation, this was in Missoula, 
MT. She was covering this up until she 
faced probable prosecution. She has 
never apologized for this crime, for 
covering it up. I think the coverup is as 
serious, in many ways, as anything 
else. For this reason and some others, 
I oppose her confirmation and believe 
that Montana and our Nation deserve 
better. 
One week ago today, I stood here and 
laid out the new and very damning in-
formation we had learned just over the 
last 47 days about Ms. Stone-Manning 
and her obstruction of a Federal inves-
tigation into an ecoterrorist tree-spik-
ing crime. In fact, just last week, in a 
U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee meeting on Ms. 
Stone-Manning, my Republican col-
leagues and I urged committee Demo-
crats to listen to the new information, 
to listen to the alarming new facts 
that we have learned about her knowl-
edge of the crime and the relationship 
she had with the perpetrators. 
In coming from Montana and having 
spoken with several Montana State 
legislators, I want to make sure my 
colleagues understand that the story 
that was told for years is much dif-
ferent than what we now know to be 
true. Up until 47 days ago, Montanans, 
the Montana State Legislature, the 
Montana media, and I were led to be-
lieve that, in the tree-spiking crime 
that happened in 1989, Ms. Stone-Man-
ning was a hero, that she helped put 
bad people in jail. As I shared last 
week, that is unequivocally false. 
Here is the truth: Ms. Stone-Manning 
obstructed the Federal investigation 
for 4 years. Rather than bring crimi-
nals to justice—we are talking about 
very bad people who went on to com-
mit even more violence—Ms. Stone- 
Manning assisted and helped them 
evade justice for years—for years. Now, 
last week, during the committee meet-
ing and the debate we had over Ms. 
Stone-Manning’s 
nomination, 
there 
was discussion, discussion as to wheth-
er or not she was part of the investiga-
tion at all or whether she was a target 
of the investigation. 
What we know now is that Ms. Stone- 
Manning only came forward after she 
was caught. What happened is, 4 years 
later, suddenly, an insider to the crime 
came forward with new information to 
the FBI. So she came forward after she 
was caught. She knew she was likely 
headed to prison. She didn’t come for-
ward because she wanted to help put 
bad people in jail, primarily. She didn’t 
come on her own volition. She knew 
she had to get some kind of a deal or 
she was on her way to prison. She 
didn’t come forward when she was sub-
poenaed, when she was questioned 
about the crime, when she was asked 
by the FBI for her hair, handwriting, 
and fingerprint samples. In fact, she 
was described by the investigator as 
the ‘‘nastiest of the suspects.’’ She was 
described as being vulgar, antagonistic, 
and extremely anti-government. 
You see, Ms. Stone-Manning only 
came forward after she received a tar-
get letter from the grand jury, mean-
ing that she was going to be indicted 
on criminal charges. She struck an im-
munity deal several years later for her 
involvement. I am not sure how one 
can argue that she was not part of an 
investigation. That is how she an-
swered, by the way, when she was ques-
tioned by the committee if she were 
part of an investigation. She said no. 
Now, you tell me how you are not part 
of an investigation when I have laid 
out these facts. 
Ms. Stone-Manning bad-mouthed law 
enforcement for investigating her in-
volvement despite the fact that she 
knew all of the details of the crime— 
all of them. She stonewalled the Fed-
eral investigation. For 4 years, from 
1989 to 1993, she remained silent, but 
she had all of the information. While 
she was withholding this information, 
tragically, one of the perpetrators went 
on to commit a terrible act of domestic 
violence. 
I want to talk for a moment about 
that letter that Ms. Stone-Manning 
typed and mailed. Remember, this was 
not available to us until just 47 days 
ago. Ms. Stone-Manning stated that 
she simply mailed this anonymous let-
ter and that she got it from a rather 
‘‘frightening man’’—her words. Well, 
we have learned since that, based on 
new information, that the frightening 
man was her roommate. We also 
learned that this letter had not only 
been 
collaboratively 
composed 
but 
that, after waiting for a few days, she 
went and typed it and sent it. She went 
and rented a typewriter to type this 
letter up when she sent it, which, ac-
cording to her own testimony, was be-
cause she wanted to avoid having it on 
her own computer and avoid having 
any fingerprints that could be traced 
back to her. 
The words that Ms. Stone-Manning 
typed and mailed are explicit and not 
what you send and what you type when 
you want to protect people. They are 
what you say when you want to fright-
en people. That is the whole idea of ter-
rorism. 
Ms. Stone-Manning typed: ‘‘You bas-
tards go in there anyway, and a lot of 
people could get hurt.’’ 
She also typed on this rented type-
writer: ‘‘I would be more than willing 
to pay you a dollar for the sale, but 
you would have to find me first, and 
that could be your WORST’’—that was 
all typed in caps; it is publicly avail-
able—‘‘nightmare.’’ 
The text of this letter was made pub-
lic for the first time just 47 days ago. 
You see, Montana has never had the 
opportunity to read what Stone-Man-
ning retyped on a rented typewriter 
and mailed until 47 days ago. 
I find the most disturbing piece of 
this story to be that Stone-Manning 
has never shown contrition or remorse 
for her handling of the situation. She 
has never apologized for her role or for 
misleading Montanans. We have yet to 
see a public statement from her in re-
sponse to this new information. 
I believe healthy debate is important 
in this institution, and I believe it is 
important at the committee level when 
discussing and advancing nominees 
who will potentially lead a major 
Agency, including Stone-Manning and 
the Bureau of Land Management’s— 
critical to the West—10,000 employees 
who are overseeing 245 million acres of 
land. 
In fact, last week, one of my col-
leagues across the aisle explained how 
it was a shame that Ms. Stone-Man-
ning was not there to defend herself 
from this new information we have 
learned over the last few weeks. I agree 
with that. I agreed with her comment 
then, and I agree with it now, because 
in light of this new information and 
the fact we have yet to see a statement 
in response from the nominee, I think 
Ms. Stone-Manning should come before 
the committee before we move forward, 
further explain her involvement, and 
have the opportunity to speak to the 
new information we have learned about 
her 
involvement 
in 
a 
tree-spiking 
crime. That is why I am urging my col-
leagues to take this step here to not 
discharge her nomination from the 
committee today. 
Now, by the way, for those who are 
watching, why is it we are going to dis-
charge a nominee from the committee? 
What does that mean? Well, that 
means there was no bipartisan support 
for the nominee because we are in a 50– 
50 Senate. So it takes a special action 
here to bring a purely partisan kind of 
vote out of a committee for floor ac-
tion. In fact, the only bipartisanship 
we have seen is her opposition, those 
who are opposed to her leading the Bu-
reau of Land Management. 
In fact, we now have two Obama offi-
cials who have raised concerns about 
Ms. Stone-Manning and what her con-
firmation would mean for the Agency. 
In fact, President Obama’s former Di-
rector of the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, Bob Abbey, said that her in-
volvement in the tree-spiking crime 
would cause needless controversy and 
that it ‘‘should disqualify’’ her. We just

learned yesterday that a second Obama 
official, Steve Ellis, who was the Dep-
uty Director for the Agency under 
President Obama, said that this isn’t a 
Republican or Democratic issue; it is 
about the letter she sent. 
He went on to say: 
The administration’s got some great ini-
tiatives and their agenda for public lands is 
good, but you need the career employees to 
implement your agenda successfully across 
the West. Your leader has got to be respected 
by career employees and across the land-
scape, in both blue and red states.’’ 
We know, sadly, this isn’t the case. 
I am here today to urge my col-
leagues to wait to move forward with 
this nomination of Ms. Stone-Manning 
and allow debate to continue at the 
committee level. We had very spirited 
debate last week. 
One important note that I want to 
make here before wrapping is that this 
is not just an issue for the West. Ms. 
Stone-Manning’s conduct should cause 
alarm to not only Senators who rep-
resent Bureau of Land Management 
States but every State with a logging 
industry. 
Stone-Manning’s refusal to come for-
ward for 4 years placed the safety of 
loggers in jeopardy, which is offensive 
to loggers across our country, from the 
loggers in Maine, which is the most 
forested State in the Nation; to loggers 
in State likes New Hampshire, Georgia; 
to the forestry, wildlife, and logging 
groups like Meadow River Hardwood 
Lumber Company, the Houston Safari 
Club, the Idaho Logging Council, who 
withdrew their support or have come 
out in opposition. 
Ms. Stone-Manning’s actions matter 
and should not be accepted by any Sen-
ator. Montanans and all Americans de-
serve to hear directly from her, from 
Ms. Stone-Manning, about why she ob-
structed a Federal investigation for 4 
years and why she has yet to show any 
remorse. 
I think it is also important for my 
colleagues across the aisle who admit-
ted they don’t know anything about 
the nominee—we heard that in the 
committee 
hearing 
last 
week—or 
haven’t spoken with her to have the 
opportunity to learn more as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my wife 
and I received our COVID vaccinations, 
and we were grateful to the scientists, 
the doctors, the nurses, and everyone 
else who made those miracle medicines 
possible. 
It is a relief to see vaccination num-
bers in this country picking up a little 
bit in the last few days after declining 
for months. 
It is a relief to hear some of the loud-
est anti-vax quacks change their tune 
about the importance of getting vac-
cinated. While many of these char-
latans and blowhards were dreaming up 
bizarre theories about the vaccines, the 
virus was not idle. In fact, months of 
confusion and quackery have given the 
virus a chance to mutate and, sadly, to 
again regain the upper hand. 
This mutation, known as the Delta 
variant, is now in every State in the 
Union. COVID infections, hospitaliza-
tions, and deaths are on the rise again. 
Almost all—almost all—of those who 
are hospitalized and facing serious ill-
ness and even death are unvaccinated. 
We know that. 
But this is a virus the world has 
never seen before, and the science is 
still evolving. What scientists don’t 
know yet is whether people who are 
vaccinated against COVID can spread 
the Delta variant even if they experi-
ence few symptoms. 
While unvaccinated people should 
wear a mask whenever out in public, 
the CDC is recommending that vac-
cinated people who live in high-trans-
mission areas also wear masks in in-
door public spaces for now. Further, 
vaccinated people who have vulnerable 
individuals in their households—young 
children 
or 
those 
who 
are 
immunocompromised—should 
wear 
masks in public places. And finally, the 
CDC is recommending universal mask-
ing for all teachers, staff members, and 
students in school, regardless of vac-
cination status. 
No one—no one—wants to wear a face 
mask. We all hoped that those days 
were all behind us. But I am bringing 
this mask with me in my pocket to be 
ready to use it when needed; others 
should do the same. 
If you want to protect yourself, your 
family, and your community, get the 
jab. It is free and safe. Until then, wear 
the mask when you must. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. President, on another topic, I am 
saddened today to learn of the death of 
our former colleague Mike Enzi. 
Mike Enzi was my friend. We were 
elected to the Senate the same year. 
Nearly a year and a half of pandemic 
losses has reminded us all that life is 
fragile and fleeting. Even so, Mike 
Enzi’s sudden passing has left many of 
us stunned. 
It was less than 8 months ago when 
Mike came up to me on the floor and 
bid me farewell, as he entered his re-
tirement. 
As I said, we were elected to the Sen-
ate in the same year. He was a staunch 
conservative Wyoming Republican. I 
am a proud Democrat. But over the 
years, we found grounds for friendship. 
We disagreed on a lot of issues, but we 
respected one another, and we trusted 
one another. 
Trust in another’s character and mo-
tives sometimes seems to be in a dwin-
dling supply in this Chamber, but it is 
essential for the Senate to function. 
Mike Enzi of Wyoming knew that. He 
was willing to reach across the aisle 
and look for partners. 
The most unlikely political alliance I 
could 
think 
of 
was 
Mike 
Enzi 
cochairing a committee with Senator 
Ted Kennedy, of all people, on edu-
cation. Several years ago, he even 
reached across the aisle to ask me to 
join him in a legislative effort. It was 
one that I was aware of. Byron Dorgan 
of North Dakota had been one of the 
early authors of this legislation. It was 
basically designed to help small busi-
nesses and Main Street America have a 
fighting chance in the age of Amazon. 
Over the years, we had seen too many 
mom-and-pop stores and other small 
businesses 
crushed 
by 
competition 
from online retail giants, in part be-
cause of an unfair advantage. Unlike 
brick-and-mortar merchants, online- 
only retailers didn’t have to pay State 
and local sales taxes. That is unfair, 
and it created an advantage for the on-
line marketers over the small busi-
nesses on Main Street. Communities 
and States had a harder time paying 
for schools, police protection, and 
other vital services as more sales shift-
ed to online and sales tax revenue fell. 
As a former mayor and retailer, own-
ing a shoestore, Mike Enzi understood 
well how the unfair taxing system hurt 
brick-and-mortar retailers, and it also 
hurt State and local governments and 
their taxpayers. He had a solution, 
called the Marketplace Fairness Act, 
to apply the same sales tax rules to all 
retailers—simple, basic fairness. He 
asked me if I would be his Democratic 
partner in this effort. I agreed. 
Our bill passed the Senate in the year 
2013. Later, a Supreme Court decision 
clarifying that State and local govern-
ments have the authority to collect on-
line sales tax made our bill unneces-
sary. But during the time we worked 
together, Mike Enzi was a good part-
ner. He practiced what he called the 80 
percent tool. He spoke about that tool, 
as he called it, in his farewell remarks 
here on the floor of the Senate. He said 
that we are ‘‘all looking to make our 
communities and country a better 
place. We might not always agree on 
what the solutions are, but we can re-
spect each other for working to find 
one.’’ 
He went on to say: 
The 80 percent tool is where all of our en-
ergy, attention, and talents should be fo-
cused. If we just worked on the 20 percent 
that we don’t agree on, and will never agree 
on, we will only generate headlines about 
how hard we are working, and nothing actu-
ally getting done—just gridlock. 
Relying on his 80 percent tool en-
abled Mike Enzi to work with Ted Ken-
nedy to reauthorize Head Start Pro-
grams for preschoolers and tuition as-
sistance programs for college students. 
He loved his State. He loved the Sen-
ate. He loved America. 
Mike Enzi and his wife Diana were an 
amazing partnership, too, for over 50 
years—three children and many grand-
children. 
Loretta and I send our condolences to 
Diana. Mike was a wonderful friend and 
colleague in the U.S. Senate, and he 
will be missed. 
SIMONE BILES 
Mr. President, on an unrelated topic, 
over this past week, the Olympics have 
been an inspiring display of global 
unity and friendly competition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5091 
July 27, 2021 
The champions representing America 
have taken Tokyo by storm. We have 
won 25 medals, 9 gold medals so far. 
But earlier today, we received word 
that one of our great athletes, Simone 
Biles, was taking a step back from to-
day’s competition. In announcing her 
decision, she cited the need to ‘‘focus 
on my mental health and not jeop-
ardize my health and wellbeing.’’ 
There is no doubt that this is one of 
the hardest decisions Ms. Biles has had 
to make in her young life, but it is not 
only what she viewed as the right deci-
sion, it was a courageous decision. 
She is the most decorated gymnast in 
America’s history. She is an inspira-
tion to millions of aspiring athletes 
and fans around the globe. And she is 
by all means a living legend. But she is 
also a human, a young woman who 
today had the courage to step forward 
and share her humanity with the 
world. She is an inspiration to all of us, 
on or off the mat, in competition or 
not in competition. 
Over the past 18 months, the pan-
demic has compelled each of us to ap-
preciate 
our 
common 
humanity. 
COVID–19 has claimed the lives of too 
many friends and family members. It 
has prevented us from coming together 
with people we cherish, and it has put 
many of our plans on hold. It has 
caused and compounded unimaginable 
stress, and it has exacted an unimagi-
nable toll. Job loss, not enough food on 
the table, hardship, paying bills, racial 
injustice, all of these stressors on life 
have been magnified. 
So if we can learn from Simone Biles’ 
example today, it is that everyone has 
a burden to carry, and the pandemic 
has made many of these burdens heav-
ier, especially for working families. 
I happen to think we have a responsi-
bility—if we can—to help each other 
carry those burdens. Here in Congress, 
we—as lawmakers—have the power to 
help people. For the single mother who 
lost her job waiting tables because of 
the pandemic, we have the power to 
help her pay her utility bills. For the 
recent graduate struggling to afford 
student loan payments and health in-
surance, we have the power to make 
their life more affordable. For the 
owner of a coffee shop who is consid-
ering laying off employees to stay in 
business, we have the power to help 
him keep those employees on the pay-
roll. To me, this is what President 
Biden’s plan to build back better is all 
about: eliminating the daily stressors 
that keep people up all night, giving 
people some breathing room so that 
they can focus on the things that real-
ly matter. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, like all 
of our colleagues, I was stunned to 
wake up this morning and find out that 
our friend and colleague Mike Enzi had 
been killed in a tragic accident, I think 
involving a bicycle, and I think we are 
still reeling from that. 
I 
just 
want 
to 
share 
a 
couple 
thoughts, if I could. I see the Senator 
from Oklahoma is here to speak after 
me, and I will be brief. 
I think maybe one of the last bills 
that Mike Enzi introduced, I was privi-
leged to cosponsor with him. It was a 
postal naming bill. We do those from 
time to time, as the Presiding Officer 
knows. There is a post office in Wyo-
ming that under the bill would be 
named after the late father of Bobbi 
Barrasso, Senator JOHN
BARRASSO’s 
wife. Her dad had served in the mili-
tary—I believe in World War II and the 
Korean war, as I recall—with great 
honor and courage. He was awarded a 
number of military awards, I think in-
cluding the Bronze Star, maybe the 
Purple Heart and others. I was privi-
leged to cosponsor that bill, and it got 
passed in wrap-up in Congress last De-
cember. 
One of my first memories of serving 
in the U.S. Senate also involved Mike 
Enzi. I was the Presiding Officer sitting 
right where you are sitting, Mr. Pre-
siding Officer, and Mike Enzi took the 
floor and began to speak. He talked 
about something called the 80–20 rule, 
and I didn’t know what he was talking 
about. I heard several iterations of an 
80–20 rule. But I listened to him talk. 
He talked a bit about how he and Ted 
Kennedy, one of the most liberal Sen-
ators in the Senate, and Mike Enzi, one 
of the more conservative Members of 
the Senate, how they managed to work 
together and get a lot done as senior 
members of what would become the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee, the HELP Com-
mittee, here in the Senate. 
I didn’t know Mike Enzi. I was brand 
new here, and he had been here a cou-
ple of years before that. 
When he was finishing up, I asked 
one of the pages to give him a note. 
The note said: Dear Senator Enzi, be-
fore you leave the floor, would you 
come and chat with me? 
I was sitting right there. It was a 
slow day, so he finished up, and he 
came up to chat with me while I was 
sitting—presiding as Presiding Officer. 
I said: Mike, what is the 80–20 rule, 
and how does it apply here? 
He talked about his relationship with 
Ted Kennedy. He said: Ted Kennedy is 
one of the most liberal Democrats in 
the Senate, and I am one of the more 
conservative Republicans. He said: We 
get a lot done. 
And they really did. It was a very 
productive committee. 
I said: How does the 80–20 rule work? 
He said: Ted and I agree on about 80 
percent of the issues that come before 
our committee, and we disagree maybe 
on another 20 percent. He said: What he 
and I have agreed to do is just—we 
focus on the 80 percent where we agree, 
and we just say the other 20 percent, 
we will set that aside and take it up 
another day. 
I said: Is that what you do? 
He said: Yes. 
I said: Is this something you just 
started doing recently? 
He said: No. We have done it for sev-
eral years. 
I said: No kidding? 
He said: No kidding. 
And, you know, when I think about 
that, I know we are going through a 
tough patch right now with infrastruc-
ture and trying to figure out how to 
put together a bipartisan package with 
water and water infrastructure, roads, 
highways, bridges, broadband, intercity 
passenger rail, transit, and it is not 
easy. It is not easy. 
As I heard about Mike’s death today, 
I thought about that spirit, the 80–20 
rule. Maybe we can take a little bit of 
that and use that to get us across the 
finish line on the legislation that is 
being worked on. I hope so. It is an im-
portant bill, and it is important legis-
lation. A lot of people in this country 
are counting on us to do that. 
On a personal note, you can’t think 
of Mike Enzi without thinking of his 
wife Diana. They were inseparable. 
They were here. They were in Wyoming 
and traveling all over the State to-
gether. As popular as he was, she might 
have been even more popular. I know 
that is the case in my State with my 
wife and me. 
But I just want to say to her and to 
the Enzi family just a real thank-you 
for sharing not just with the people of 
Wyoming, but the people of this coun-
try, a very, very good man—a very 
good man. We are grateful for that gift 
that you shared with us and mourn his 
death, untimely; he died too soon. I 
feel thrilled and privileged to have 
served with him. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, a few 
weeks ago, President Biden nominated 
Tracy Stone-Manning to be the leader 
of the Bureau of Land Management. 
Many people in my State don’t know 
much about the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. We don’t have a lot of areas 
actually managed in our State by 
BLM. It has more than 10,000 employ-
ees. It manages roughly an eighth of 
the Nation’s land, including 65 million 
acres of our forests. The land holds 30 
percent of our minerals. Whoever leads 
this entity leads the issue of how we 
are managing our forests, how we are 
handling our minerals, how we are han-
dling our energy development, live-
stock grazing, recreation, and, yes, 
timber harvesting. 
The individual President Biden nomi-
nated we now know was an Earth First! 
ecoterrorist. She actually typed out, as 
she has admitted in the past, a threat-
ening letter that was sent out to lead-
ers who were doing forestry in Idaho, 
saying in her letter that she typed 
out—and she has admitted that she 
typed out the threatening letter—that 
‘‘we,’’ as she put it, drove 500 pounds of 
spikes into the trees in the Idaho forest 
and then threatened them, to say: If 
you harvest those trees, it will not be 
good for you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5092 
July 27, 2021 
The challenge that we have here is 
that we have an individual who has ad-
mitted that she actually was a part of 
a group to do tree spiking. Now, what 
we don’t know is if she actually drove 
a spike. We have no idea. But we do 
know that she turned evidence on the 
other people who did and admitted as a 
part of her plea bargain that she is the 
one who actually did the letter from a 
rented typewriter to be able to make 
sure she couldn’t be traced and even in 
the letter said: If you find me, it would 
be ‘‘your worst nightmare.’’ 
So what do we do about this? Typi-
cally, when you are going to deal with 
the person who handles forestry for the 
United States and the Bureau of Land 
Management and you find out this per-
son has been involved in tree spiking, 
which actually is designed to injure or 
kill people who are logging or people 
who are actually harvesting the lumber 
in the sawmills and actually processing 
that lumber, it would cause a pause. 
I cannot imagine what it is going to 
be if she is actually confirmed in this 
position, and the individuals who come 
to her to get a permit to be able to do 
any kind of forestry work, because 
they would have to actually come to 
her office, what they would think when 
they actually walked through the door, 
because the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment notices timber sales and signs off 
on timber sales for the country. The 
Bureau of Land Management is the one 
that makes forest product sale plans. 
The Bureau of Land Management is the 
one that develops, maintains, and re-
vises the plans for all public manage-
ment, including identifying areas for 
timber sales. In fact, the Bureau of 
Land Management is also the group 
who sends in the firefighters to the 
wildfires to be able to put out the fires, 
which could be including some of these 
same trees in the days ahead that ap-
parently still have the spikes in them 
from decades ago. Understanding this 
is not just a loose issue. Individuals 
from the Biden administration just re-
cently have talked about how timber 
harvesters and haulers are critical to 
forest management across the country. 
We need these individuals to help with 
our 
forest 
management. 
We 
have 
wildfires in the areas that individuals 
in the Biden administration have testi-
fied because we are actually not main-
taining our forest management enough. 
We are not doing enough harvesting 
and thinning in those areas, and so it is 
actually a problem. 
In fact, Christopher French, the Dep-
uty Chief of the National Forest Sys-
tem, recently testified the Forest Serv-
ice research indicates we need to dra-
matically increase the extent of im-
pact 
of 
fuels 
treatment, 
such 
as 
thinning, harvesting, planting, and pre-
scribed burning across all landscapes. 
But yet the leader for the Bureau of 
Land Management who has been rec-
ommended is an individual who has 
been outspoken in opposition, so much 
so that she has been active in actually 
promoting spiking trees. 
And it is not just spiking trees. It has 
also been her environmental issues 
about grazing land—understanding the 
Bureau of Land Management is respon-
sible for millions of acres of grazing 
pastureland across the West. Because 
the Federal Government owns so much 
land across the West, many ranchers 
actually then lease out some of that 
land for grazing. She has been out-
spoken as an opponent against this. 
That is not going to help our ranchers 
across the West. 
And what was most stark to me was 
this presentation that she had years 
ago, where she designed several of what 
she considered to be environmental-fo-
cused advertisements, this being one of 
them where she has a picture of a 
young girl, and the heading is: ‘‘Can 
you find the environmental hazard in 
this photo?’’ 
And then she lists out at the bottom 
of it: ‘‘That’s right. It’s the cute baby 
that’s the environmental hazard.’’ 
With this statement below that, she 
wrote: ‘‘We breed more than any other 
industrialized nation.’’ 
Listen, I understand every President 
has the right to pick their team, but 
when the leader of the Bureau of Land 
Management considers this little girl 
to be an environmental hazard, have 
we not crossed a threshold of saying 
our problem with our environment is 
that we have too many little girls? 
Honestly, is anyone else disturbed by 
this as a possibility to lead the Bureau 
of Land Management, to make a deci-
sion about how we are going to manage 
our forests, how we are going to handle 
our grazing land, and what is going to 
be the general attitude about permit-
ting and people? 
Because, apparently, from what she 
wrote, one of the biggest environ-
mental hazards we have as a country is 
we breed too much. 
I don’t think that little girl is a haz-
ard. I think it is a little girl. And I will 
absolutely oppose Tracy Stone-Man-
ning to lead the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. And I would ask my col-
leagues, even one of my colleagues on 
the other side, to say: Do you not see a 
problem with this nominee? 
If so, let’s find another person. Sure-
ly there is another Democrat out there 
who doesn’t have this set of views, who 
can lead our forestry, our grazing area, 
and our mineral rights. Surely there is 
one more Democrat who is out there 
somewhere who does not share these 
views, because I don’t think that little 
girl is a hazard. I think she is a bless-
ing. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be able to speak 
for 5 minutes and, following me, the 
Senator from Wyoming be able to 
speak for 8 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about the life and legacy of our 
friend, Mike Enzi, and his sudden loss. 
I saw Mike via Zoom just last week 
at the Senate prayer breakfast. Mike 
got up a little earlier than the rest of 
us to be able to join us over the inter-
net from Wyoming. But he liked par-
ticipating in the prayer breakfast. And 
as we were reminded by some of our 
colleagues—I think Senator LANKFORD 
may have mentioned it—Mike could al-
ways be depended on if somebody was a 
last-minute cancellation, which hap-
pened from time to time. 
Of course, it had only been a matter 
of a few months since Mike had retired, 
marking the conclusion of a storied ca-
reer in public service. Mike literally 
did it all. He served in the military and 
at every level of government, from the 
mayor’s office in Gillette to the State 
legislature, to here in the U.S. Senate. 
And he always put the people of Wyo-
ming first. 
Mike was pretty unique in this place 
because he never sought the spotlight. 
In many ways, it seemed like he was 
allergic to getting any sort of atten-
tion from the press or otherwise. 
Whether he was in the midst of a high- 
pressure negotiation or celebrating a 
big legislative victory, Mike did not 
run to the TV cameras or reporters in 
the hallways. He preferred to work 
quietly behind the scenes, effectively 
resolving 
differences 
in 
a 
quiet, 
thoughtful way. And once he suc-
ceeded, he didn’t claim the credit for 
himself. He claimed credit for others. 
During Mike’s 24 years in the Senate, 
he certainly had a lot of successes to 
celebrate, and he let me in on his win-
ning formula not long after I got here. 
At the time, he and the liberal lion of 
the 
Senate, 
Teddy 
Kennedy, 
were 
chairman and ranking member of the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. I think they may 
have 
swapped 
out 
as 
majorities 
changed; one became chairman, and 
the other became ranking member. 
But I asked him how Mike, the 
staunch Western conservative that he 
was, could work so productively with 
somebody who shared very different 
views. And he told me it is easy. It is 
the 80–20 rule. You are not going to 
agree or disagree with 100 percent of 
what someone has to say, but if you 
focus on the 20 percent or that that you 
will never agree on, you overlook the 
80 percent that you can agree on. 
Well, as simple as it may sound, it is 
a winning formula for success here in 
the Senate, and more of us should prac-
tice the 80–20 rule. At a time when 
more attention is paid to what divides 
us than what unites us, I hope the leg-
acy of Mike Enzi and the 80–20 rule will 
remain a constant in the Senate. 
As we honor the life and legacy of 
our good friend, Mike Enzi, there is an-
other favorite saying of his that has 
been on my mind. He used to say: You 
have to have an attitude of gratitude. 
Well, Mike was always grateful— 
grateful to God, grateful to live in this 
great country, grateful to the people of 
Wyoming for the opportunity to serve 
them, and, of course, grateful for his

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon be-
cause we have heard a lot here today 
about Tracy Stone-Manning, her nomi-
nation to head the Bureau of Land 
Management, and how completely dis-
qualified she is for that post. 
As you have heard, it is a critically 
important Agency, especially for those 
of us in Western States. It manages al-
most one-eighth of the entire land 
mass of the United States. In my home 
State of Wyoming, the Bureau of Land 
Management oversees 18 million acres. 
If you came to the Energy Committee, 
and as I told my friend and colleague 
JOE MANCHIN, that is more territory 
than the entire State of his home State 
of West Virginia; and in the case of the 
Presiding Officer, more than the size of 
your State by a lot. 
It is not just my State. This Agency 
oversees 12 million acres of public land 
in Arizona, 48 million acres of land in 
Nevada, and 8 million in Montana. It is 
like that all across the West. Included 
in the land that it manages is almost 
65 million acres of Federal forests. 
The Bureau is also responsible for 
hundreds of millions of acres of min-
eral land below the surface. It is crit-
ical to America’s energy independence. 
There is a lot of energy that is under 
those lands. 
Tracy Stone-Manning has no busi-
ness leading this agency—none whatso-
ever. She helped plan a tree spiking in 
one of our country’s National Forests. 
She sent a threatening letter to the 
U.S. Forest Service about it. She did 
not cooperate with Federal investiga-
tors, blocked the investigation, only 
testified when she received immunity, 
and lied to our committee about it. 
There is bipartisan concern about 
this nomination. I will tell you Bob 
Abbey, who was President Obama’s Di-
rector of Bureau of Land Management, 
said that her actions ‘‘should dis-
qualify’’ her. This is President Obama’s 
nominee to run that Bureau. Because 
Bob Abbey understands the job and 
knows her involvement with tree spik-
ing, it should eliminate her from any 
consideration. 
So Steve Ellis, who was the Deputy 
Director of the Bureau of Land Man-
agement during the Obama administra-
tion, and he was the highest ranking 
career official at the Agency, he raised 
concerns about Stone-Manning as well. 
This is what he said. He said: 
Much of the focus seems to be whether this 
is a Democrat or Republican thing, but [he 
said] the lens that I look at this through is 
as a 38-year career person in both agencies, 
and that letter she wrote went to my Forest 
Service colleagues on the Clearwater. 
He makes a very important point. 
How can the men and women of the Bu-
reau of Land Management, people who 
have devoted their lives to work for 
this Agency, how can they respect 
President 
Biden’s 
nominee, 
Tracy 
Stone-Manning, when they know she 
threatened their colleagues at the U.S. 
Forest Service? 
Conservation 
organizations 
have 
begun to pull their support as well. The 
Dallas Safari Club and the Houston Sa-
fari Club, which each represent thou-
sands of outdoorsmen and -women have 
both now reversed their support and 
now publicly oppose her nomination 
now that they have learned this addi-
tional information. 
Radical ideas are nothing new for 
Tracy Stone-Manning. Around the time 
of the criminal tree spiking, she wrote 
her graduate thesis. In her thesis, she 
argued that Americans need to have 
fewer children because children are a 
threat to the environment. She even 
made ads to promote these ideas. These 
are ideas you hear in Communist 
China, not from a nominee to be the 
Director of the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. 
Now, some Democrats have defended 
Tracy Stone-Manning by saying this 
tree spiking was decades ago. Her rad-
ical views have not changed, I will as-
sure you, Mr. President, because right 
now many States in the West are burn-
ing from raging, dangerous wildfires. 
Management of these fires has be-
come a constant conservation—or con-
versation at the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee and on the Sen-
ate floor, and we actually discussed it 
this morning in the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee. 
Tracy Stone-Manning has current 
views on this one as well. Her husband, 
Richard Manning, wrote in Harpers 
that firefighters should let homes built 
in forests burn. He wrote: 
There’s a rude and satisfying justice [satis-
fying justice] in burning down the house of 
someone who builds in the forest. 
Now, Tracy Stone-Manning is not re-
sponsible for the views of her husband. 
But last September, as wildfires burned 
last year—and we had hearings on 
those—she actually endorsed her hus-
band’s views on letting it burn and let-
ting the houses burn. In a tweet, she 
called her husband’s comments a clar-
ion call. It wasn’t 30 years ago. It is 
about 10 months ago. Tracy Stone- 
Manning endorsed her husband’s call to 
action that homes in the forest should 
be allowed to burn. 
There are currently wildfires burning 
in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Cali-
fornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, South 
Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyo-
ming. All of these States have BLM 
lands. This year’s largest fire, the 
Bootleg fire, has burned over 400,000 
acres, 7 homes, and more than 40 other 
buildings. Thousands of homes are still 
threatened. 
This year, around 2 million acres 
have burned so far in the Western 
States. 
Last 
year 
alone, 
wildfires 
burned and damaged over 17,000 struc-
tures. 
And what do they call it—what does 
her husband call it, and what does she 
tweet about? ‘‘Satisfying justice in 
burning down the house.’’ 
How can Senate Democrats vote to 
confirm a nominee who has advocated 
to let the homes of their own constitu-
ents burn? 
These views are disturbing and dan-
gerous. President Biden has made the 
threat of domestic terrorism a focus of 
his administration. His own National 
Security Council recently released a 
strategy to address domestic terrorism. 
It specifically includes the threat of 
domestic environmental terrorists. But 
he has nominated someone who admit-
ted to conspiring with terrorists. 
Every Senator needs to consider 
carefully if they want their name asso-
ciated with Tracy Stone-Manning. All 
10 Republicans on the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee have asked 
President Biden to withdraw the nomi-
nation. We all voted against her nomi-
nation last week during a committee 
business meeting. 
She conspired with ecoterrorists. She 
lied to the Senate. She still holds radi-
cally reprehensible views. 
Tracy Stone-Manning should never 
be the Director of the Bureau of Land 
Management. The Senate must reject 
her nomination. I strongly oppose her 
nomination and urge each and every 
Member to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, in Mon-
tana, public lands are a way of life. 
They create thousands of jobs; they 
bring billions of dollars into our State; 
and they form the backbone of our out-
door heritage. 
Today—today—we have an oppor-
tunity to take another important step 
forward in putting a real public servant 
who will hold herself accountable to 
the taxpayer once confirmed to lead 
the Bureau of Land Management. 
I know Tracy Stone-Manning. Tracy 
Stone-Manning is a tireless advocate 
for the outdoor spaces that make Mon-
tana special. She is a collaborative— 
collaborative—responsible leader, and 
at the BLM she will bring nonpartisan 
stewardship to our Nation’s greatest 
treasures. 
Tracy is dedicated to smart manage-
ment of our public lands. She is dedi-
cated to the habitat and to the out-
doors and is one of the hardest working 
people that I know. 
But, unfortunately, Members of this 
body have played politics with her 
nomination. They have dragged a good 
person’s name through the muck in a 
cynical smear campaign ginned up by 
folks who would rather play politics 
than see a qualified, competent woman 
running the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment. 
Now, it is particularly galling that 
these same folks stood by silently—or, 
worse, 
cheered—as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5094 
July 27, 2021 
Pendley led the Agency illegally, with-
out Senate confirmation, under the 
previous administration: Pendley, a 
fringe climate change denier who ex-
plicitly called for the Federal Govern-
ment to sell off all its public lands and 
who 
actively 
encouraged 
armed 
standoffs between law enforcement and 
ranchers. 
It is a shame that we have people 
who put politics above people and our 
public lands, but that is the unfortu-
nate reality of the U.S. Senate in 
Washington, DC. 
The person these folks have made 
Tracy out to be is not the person that 
I have known and worked with over the 
last decade-plus. If she were that, I 
would not be standing here supporting 
her today. She will bring good old-fash-
ioned Montana common sense to the 
Bureau of Land Management, along 
with a steadfast dedication to manage 
our public lands and the thousands of 
jobs that rely on those public lands. 
She will lead the Agency with dignity 
and honor and integrity. 
And, as she has done her entire ca-
reer, Tracy will bring folks together, 
from both sides of the aisle and all 
sides of the issue, to get things done 
and make a real impact on our public 
lands. 
I am proud to support Tracy Stone- 
Manning, and I look forward to seeing 
the great work that she will do as the 
next leader of the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all remaining time be yielded 
back.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here once again to shed a little 
light on the dark money scheme to 
capture 
and 
control 
our 
Supreme 
Court. 
As folks may recall, my first two 
speeches covered the early foundation 
of this scheme—a prominent conserv-
ative lawyer Lewis Powell’s detailed 
strategy memo for the corporate U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce and then Jus-
tice Lewis Powell’s work on the Court 
to assure his corporate power strat-
egy’s success. 
From there, I turned to what histo-
rian Richard Hofstetter called the 
paranoid style in American politics and 
how 
extreme 
anti-government 
megadonors like the Kochs harness 
that rightwing fringe and how, at the 
same time, they had at their disposal 
the polished mercenaries of corporate 
administrative agency warfare. 
Then I discussed the scheme’s two 
big recent dark money wins at the Su-
preme Court—the AFPF dark money 
case and the Brnovich voter suppres-
sion case. 
The nutshell overview of all of this is 
that it is a short jump for big donors 
from regulatory capture, which is a 
well-understood and broadly observed 
phenomenon, to applying known tech-
niques of regulatory capture to capture 
a court. 
As the big donors had this realization 
and made this jump, one of their most 
important players in applying capture 
techniques to the judiciary has been 
the Federalist Society. 
I will start with some very straight-
forward observations. Every member of 
the Court’s six-Justice Republican ma-
jority is a current or former member of 
the Federalist Society. 
Justices 
regularly 
headline 
Fed-
eralist Society fundraisers, like the 
gala Brett Kavanaugh chose for his 
first major public speaking engage-
ment after his disastrous confirmation, 
and they boast of their association 
with the group. The Federalist Society 
is a dark money organization. It re-
ceives millions in anonymous dona-
tions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5095 
July 27, 2021 
The Federalist Society carefully vet-
ted and promoted each member of the 
current Court majority. Each member 
rose to the top of the group’s donor-ap-
proved slates of nominees. Each was 
backed by the Federalist Society’s ex-
tended network of satellite groups. 
For the dark money forces behind the 
capture of the Court, the Federalist So-
ciety became their nomination’s gate-
keeper. 
The Federalist Society has three 
component efforts. The first is basi-
cally a law school debate club. At more 
or less every law school in the country, 
they organize seminars and invite aca-
demics, judges, attorneys to speak. It 
is pretty standard law school stuff. 
The second is a fairly run-of-the-mill 
Washington think tank. They issue 
newsletters, host podcasts, convene 
events with conservative legal lumi-
naries. This think tank’s mission is to 
‘‘reorder priorities within the legal sys-
tem’’ and to create a network of mem-
bers that ‘‘extends to all levels of the 
legal community.’’ 
Then there is the third Federalist So-
ciety operation. This is the gatekeeper. 
It doesn’t really care about fostering 
young legal minds. It doesn’t care 
about galas or podcasts either. It cares 
about one thing: the allegiance of Re-
publican-appointed Justices to right-
wing donors’ interests. And the dark 
money sluice gates into the Federalist 
Society provide the perfect means of 
influence. Money talks. Dark money 
whispers. 
The Federalist Society gatekeeper 
role began with the hiring of a Cornell 
Law graduate named Leonard Leo, 
fresh from a clerkship in 1991. 
Leo’s first task was building the law-
yers division to serve as a pipeline for 
rightwing lawyers to rise through the 
Federalist Society ranks toward the 
Federal courts. 
Observers say the Federalist Society 
didn’t hire Leo for his skill as an attor-
ney. What they saw in him was a savvy 
networker and fundraiser. 
Johns 
Hopkins 
professor 
Steven 
Teles, who has written extensively on 
Leo and the Federalist Society, says 
the idea was to build what he called ‘‘a 
network . . . with Leonard Leo at the 
center . . . [to] give conservatives a 
chance to meet one another and check 
one another out.’’ 
Under Leo’s new system, ‘‘the one 
thing all the lawyers [would] have in 
common is that they all know Leonard, 
and he knows all of them.’’ 
Big rightwing donors recognized the 
opportunity that Leo’s Federalist Soci-
ety operation presented: a trusted 
broker to sift through eager legal tal-
ent and pluck out adherents to donor- 
friendly, rightwing legal doctrines and 
then push the most promising adher-
ents toward judgeships, where they 
could advance the scheme’s ultimate 
goal of courts that will reliably rule in 
the donors’ favor. 
As the New Yorker’s Jeffrey Toobin 
has written, Leo quickly attracted the 
preeminent scheme funders, including 
the 
foundations 
of 
rightwing 
megadonors John Olin, Lynde and 
Harry Bradley, Richard Scaife, and, of 
course, the perennially mischievous 
and malign Koch brothers. 
The scheme also raked in anonymous 
funding through Donors Trust—what 
has been called the dark money ATM of 
the right. 
As another observer of the conserv-
ative legal movement Professor Aman-
da Hollis-Brusky said, ‘‘The funders all 
got the idea right away—that you can 
win elections, you can have mass mobi-
lizations, but unless you can change 
. . . the courts, there are limits to 
what you can do.’’ 
The second Bush administration, the 
Federalist Society quietly became the 
big donors’ nominations turnstile. 
Bush and his team welcomed Leo’s 
help. It made things easy. Need some-
one to pay for public relations cavalry 
to rescue a struggling circuit court 
nominee? Leo’s donors made it happen. 
According to a 2003 email from a 
White House staffer to the then-Presi-
dential Staff Secretary, a young guy by 
the name of Brett Kavanaugh, Leo co-
ordinated ‘‘all outside coalition activ-
ity regarding judicial nominations.’’ 
In another email uncovered by the 
Washington Post, Bush aides referred 
to Leo explicitly as their judicial 
nominations cash machine. 
‘‘Leonard Leo will know,’’ they said, 
‘‘where to find money to hold a presser 
for a failing nominee.’’ That is from 
one Bush aide to another. 
They go on: ‘‘We probably don’t want 
the 
fed 
soc’’—Federalist 
Society— 
‘‘paying for it, but he might know 
some generous donor.’’ 
Leo’s official fed soc bio, still online 
today, boasts that he ‘‘organized the 
outside coalition efforts in support of 
the Roberts and Alito U.S. Supreme 
Court confirmations.’’ The goal, of 
course, was to change the Court. The 
Court changed. 
Under Chief Justice Roberts, the 
Court’s Republican-appointed majority 
served up scores of partisan 5-to-4 deci-
sions, delivering partisan win after par-
tisan win to identifiable Republican 
donor interests. 
Even before the Republican majority 
expanded to 6, that run of wins reached 
80—80 partisan 5-to-4 decisions—a judi-
cial rout favoring very happy right-
wing donors. 
When Donald Trump assumed office, 
the Federalist Society gatekeeper role 
became even more obvious and even 
more toxic. 
You may recall that dark money em-
peror Charles Koch made waves when 
he told his rightwing network he could 
support neither Hillary Clinton nor 
Donald Trump in 2016. 
But the house of Koch and the house 
of Trump soon reached an accommoda-
tion. The house of Koch decided on a 
grand Trump gesture for their scheme 
donors—let their operative, Leonard 
Leo, handpick a list of Supreme Court 
nominees for Trump to announce early 
in the general campaign. For the price 
of known, scheme-approved Supreme 
Court prospects, peace might be ac-
quired between house of Koch and 
house of Trump. Trump announced the 
list. 
For what it is worth, I think the rest 
of the accommodation was for house of 
Trump to turn over all energy and en-
vironmental positions in government 
to climate change deniers approved by 
house of Koch, and at the end of the 
day, it was probably a lot of the same 
dark money behind both of those ac-
commodations. 
Anyway, rewind to 2016 and recall 
how large the Supreme Court loomed 
over that Presidential campaign. 
Justice Scalia died suddenly during a 
hunting trip. MITCH MCCONNELL broke 
with all Senate norms and denied 
President Obama any hearing or vote 
for President Obama’s pick to replace 
Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland. 
This vacancy would decide the par-
tisan balance of the Court, which 
meant the 2016 election would deter-
mine whether the 5-to-4 rightwing ma-
jority that had delivered so abundantly 
for the donors would end or be renewed 
for years or even generations. 
Remember Lewis Powell’s memo to 
the Chamber, ‘‘The judiciary may be 
the most important instrument for so-
cial, economic, and political change’’ 
in all of government. Well, nothing 
could focus the scheme’s donors on the 
stakes of that election more clearly 
than that vacancy. 
With 
Scalia’s 
sudden 
death, 
the 
scheme was at risk. So scheme donors’ 
dark 
money 
flowed 
in 
ever-larger 
amounts to the Federalist Society, to 
Leonard Leo, and to Donald Trump. 
Ambitious judges noticed. A court of 
appeals judge described to me the con-
duct of some of its colleagues as audi-
tioning—auditioning. 
They 
weren’t 
just deciding cases for the parties be-
fore them, they had another audience 
beyond the courtroom. You don’t audi-
tion without someone to audition to. 
These judges knew they were being as-
sessed, and they auditioned. And no 
one 
auditioned 
harder 
than 
Brett 
Kavanaugh. He filled his court of ap-
peals decisions with signaling, and 
even set the record for speeches to the 
Federalist Society. I think it was over 
50. He knew who he was auditioning 
for. 
When Trump took the White House, 
the Federalist Society assumed control 
of judicial nominations, at least the 
important ones. Trump said so himself. 
He wasn’t even subtle about it. House 
of Trump had peace to keep with House 
of Koch. This was no time for subtlety. 
Trump’s new White House Counsel, 
Don McGahn, even joked about this 
role, of course, at a 2017 Federalist So-
ciety event. He said: 
Our opponents of judicial nominees fre-
quently claim the President has outsourced 
his selection of judges. That is completely 
false. I have been a Member of the Federalist 
Society since law school. Still am. So, frank-
ly, it seems like it’s been in-sourced.

the Federalist Society to advise Trump 
directly on Supreme Court nomina-
tions. 
Now, there are unanswered questions 
about whether this was even legal, but 
the point was clear. Virtually all major 
Trump nominees would be scheme-cho-
sen, donor-approved FedSoc members. 
And, indeed, 86 percent of Trump’s Su-
preme Court and appellate court nomi-
nees were or are members. 
Leo and the Federalist Society’s con-
trol ran deep. In Leo, the donors con-
trolled an agent to orchestrate every 
aspect of Supreme Court judicial bat-
tles, and they provisioned him with 
dark money beyond imagining, and 
with a devious structure of front 
groups to hide behind while effec-
tuating their scheme. 
We are still learning about the scope 
of Leo’s covert funding and influence, 
but a 2019 Washington Post expose 
painted a remarkable picture: a vast 
network of Leo-affiliated front groups; 
shell entities with no employees and 
vague connections to Leo cutouts; 
shared post office boxes; common con-
tractors and officers across nominally 
separate entities, even some sharing 
Presidents; dark money funders, anon-
ymous advertising, and enormous pay 
packages for operatives. 
It has the earmarks of a covert oper-
ation of the sort that is run by hostile 
countries in the intelligence arena. But 
this covert operation was run in Amer-
ica against America by Americans. By 
the Post’s reckoning, $250 million in 
dark money flowed through this appa-
ratus. Testimony before the Senate Ju-
diciary 
Committee’s 
Courts 
Sub-
committee, which I chair, has since up-
dated that number to $400 million. 
Groups in this apparatus have gorged 
on dark money, their coffers swelling 
by orders of magnitude as Leo’s influ-
ence grew. 
For example, in 2002, DonorsTrust, 
the scheme’s dark money ATM, had 
contributed $5,000 to the Federalist So-
ciety. Scroll forward to the most re-
cent year on record: It contributed $7 
million. 
Before 2010, the Federalist Society 
received an occasional anonymous gift 
of $1,000 or more, at most one per year. 
Over the last decade, it averaged more 
than a dozen each and every year. Do-
nors were not kidding around, not with 
that kind of money—$400 million. The 
scheme to capture the Court was dead-
ly serious. 
Eleven days after Donald Trump was 
sworn into office, he announced Neil 
Gorsuch—a name from the Federalist 
Society’s infamous list—to fill Scalia’s 
former seat. Then Brett Kavanaugh 
was hand-walked by Leonard Leo to 
the top of the list, after all his ardent 
auditioning from his court of appeals 
seat. And 7 days before Donald Trump 
lost the 2020 election, Amy Coney Bar-
rett—a Federalist Society member and 
regular feature speaker at Federalist 
Society 
events—filled 
Ruth 
Bader 
Ginsburg’s seat. The scheme’s Fed-
eralist Society gatekeeper operation 
had delivered to its big donors a com-
plete overhaul of the Court in less than 
4 years. 
One man, his secretive array of front 
groups, and hundreds of millions of 
scheme donors’ money, delivered a 
donor-approved six-Justice majority to 
the Court.

ADD1TIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO ALBERT TREVINO 
∑ Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I 
wish to congratulate Albert Trevino on 
his retirement from the U.S. Border 
Patrol, after 26 years of faithful service 
to the American people. 
Albert started his law enforcement 
career right out of college in 1987, with 
the police force in his hometown of 
Harlingen, TX. In Harlingen, he served 
as patrol officer for the police depart-
ment for 5 years before being promoted 
to an instructor and background inves-
tigator. 
In 1995, he joined the U.S. Border Pa-
trol, ready to face greater challenges. 
He first served in El Paso, before secur-
ing a transfer back to Harlingen sev-
eral years later to patrol and protect 
his hometown community. 
During his career, Albert has had the 
opportunity to serve on the prosecu-
tions detail working with the U.S. At-
torney’s Office on prosecuting criminal 
aliens, has been a post academy in-
structor in both immigration law and 
Spanish for his fellow agents, and has 
assisted the inspector general’s office 
on background investigations. In the 
course of his career, Albert has helped 
apprehend literally thousands of illegal 
border-crossers and dozens of narcotics 
smugglers. 
Many of us in the Senate know Al-
bert through his work as an elected of-
ficial with the National Border Patrol 
Council. He was first elected to office 
in the Rio Grande Valley Sector Local 
in 1999 and then as a national vice 
president in 2011. As national vice 
president, he has chaired the legisla-
tive committee for 10 years, and for 
many of us here in Washington, Albert 
has been the face of our Nation’s Bor-
der Patrol agents. He has represented 
them faithfully and, in doing so, has 
helped support the agents who keep 
Americans safe. It is no overstatement 
to say every Senate office engaged on 
border security issues over the last 
decade has likely worked with Albert 
on an issue. His efforts on Capitol Hill 
were instrumental in the passage of the 
Border Patrol Pay Reform Act in 2014, 
that gave Border Patrol agents a stable 
pay system for the first time in 40 
years. 
I have had the pleasure of working 
with Albert on legislation to give Bor-
der Patrol agents wage parity with 
other Federal law enforcement agen-
cies by restoring Fair Labor Standards 
Act overtime. I had hoped we could 
pass this legislation before Albert re-
tired, but will keep working to bring 
this to fruition. 
I 
would 
also 
like 
to 
recognize 
Albert’s incredible family who have 
supported him throughout his career. A 
successful career in law enforcement is 
a team effort that involves the entire 
family. Border Patrol agents work long 
hours under extremely harsh condi-
tions. It is a 24/7 operation, and agents 
must work nights, weekends, and holi-
days. Family holidays and celebrations 
often get missed when you have to 
work; yet Albert’s family has been un-
wavering in their support for him. I am 
grateful for the commitment shown by 
Albert’s wife of 30 years, Edna, and 
their children Alisa and Danny. 
In closing, I would like to thank Al-
bert for his 26 years of Federal service 
to this country, to the people of the 
great State of Texas, and to his com-
munity of Harlingen. We wish you and 
your family well in your retirement, 
and we hope you see continued success 
in future endeavors.∑

TRIBUTE TO NORMAN LEAR 
∑ Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to recognize the 99th birthday of Nor-
man Lear, a man who came to Holly-
wood and entertained the Nation, then 
dedicated his life to bettering it as a 
champion for progressive values. 
Born in 1922, Norman Lear served 
bravely in the Air Force during World

War II, flying 52 combat missions over 
Europe. After the war, he made his way 
to California and struck out as a tele-
vision writer. Norman Lear’s sitcoms 
were beloved for their humor, empathy, 
and willingness to dive into the lives of 
diverse 
characters. 
His 
innovative 
shows reached more than 120 million 
viewers per week in the 1970s and ‘80s. 
And yet, in the midst of this success, 
Norman Lear put his career on hold be-
cause, once again, he felt called to 
serve his country. Distressed by the 
rise of radical rightwing activists, Nor-
man Lear founded People for the Amer-
ican Way in 1980 and became a cham-
pion of American constitutional val-
ues. 
Through his writing, producing, and 
activism, Norman Lear has strength-
ened our democracy. He has cham-
pioned free expression, civic participa-
tion, and equal justice for all. He even 
bought a copy of the Declaration of 
Independence to send on a 50–State 
tour, bringing Americans closer to our 
founding ideals and encouraging voter 
registration, a cause that is dear to 
me. 
Today, at 99, Norman Lear is still 
fighting for progressive values. He also 
continues to produce some of the fun-
niest and wisest works for the screen, 
highlighting the diverse experiences 
that make America stronger. 
I want to offer Norman Lear my best 
wishes for the first day of his 100th 
year and my thanks for his dedication 
to bettering the lives of so many.∑

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF TAPATIO 
∑ Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to recognize the 50th anniversary of 
Tapatio, a family-run company from 
the great State of California that ex-
emplifies the American Dream. 
Jose-Luis Saavedra, the founder of 
Tapatio, immigrated to California from 
Guadalajara, Mexico. He started out 
working in the aerospace industry, and 
he often shared a delicious homemade 
salsa with his coworkers. In 1971, after 
a recession shut down the plant where 
he worked, Mr. Saavedra decided to try 
perfecting and selling his hot sauce. 
Tapatio was born out of a small 
kitchen in Maywood, CA, and con-
tinues its operations to this day in 
Vernon, CA. With the hard work and 
innovation of Mr. Saavedra, his wife, 
and his children, Tapatio grew in popu-
larity and size, spreading from small 
groceries in East Los Angeles to stores 
and restaurants around the country. 
Today, Tapatio is known for intro-
ducing 
the 
flavors 
of 
Guadalajara 
around the world. It now produces 
about 200,000 bottles of Tapatio a day 
and exports globally to about 30 coun-
tries. The company has even developed 
single-serving packets of its signature 
hot sauce to meet the demand from 
American 
servicemembers 
stationed 
abroad and at least one U.S. Senator. 
Tapatio has remained a family-run 
business for 50 years, employing three 
generations of the Saavedra family. It 
is more than an immigrant success 
story, Tapatio is an icon of cultural 
ambassadorship. 
According 
to 
Mr. 
Saavedra, the Smithsonian Institute 
displayed a bottle of Tapatio to show-
case the brand’s role in spreading posi-
tive images of Latino culture. 
I congratulate Tapatio on reaching 
this historic milestone, serving as an 
important reminder of the cultural and 
economic contributions of immigrants 
to our country, and keeping the Amer-
ican dream alive for future genera-
tions.∑

TRIBUTE TO JON A. JENSEN 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Jon Jensen as he nears the end of his 
term as the 115th chairman of the na-
tion’s largest insurance association, 
the Independent Insurance Agents & 
Brokers of America, also known as the 
Big ‘‘I.’’ He has served an unprece-
dented 2-year term as chairman of the 
Big 
‘‘I’’ 
due 
to 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic’s impact on association oper-
ations throughout most of 2020. Over 
the past 2 years, he has piloted the as-
sociation through tumultuous times as 
a strong leader for independent insur-
ance 
agents 
and 
small 
businesses 
across the country. 
Jensen has made many contributions 
to the business community in South 
Carolina 
and 
the 
broader 
United 
States. A graduate from the Appa-
lachian State University’s insurance 
executive program, Jensen is currently 
the president and CEO of Correll Insur-
ance Group, which has 28 offices in 
South Carolina, North Carolina, and 
Tennessee. Jensen has also chaired the 
Independent Insurance Agents and Bro-
kers of South Carolina—IIABSC—and 
received their Young Agent and Agent 
of the Year awards. Throughout his 12 
insurance agencies, he employs ap-
proximately 
300 
South 
Carolinians 
across the State. 
At the national association level, 
Jensen has served as chairman of the 
InsurPac committee and the govern-
ment affairs committee. He has re-
ceived two Big ‘‘I’’ Chairman’s Awards 
and the Sidney O. Smith Award, the 
highest governmental affairs award 
given by the Big ‘‘I.’’ Jensen has also 
testified 
before 
Congress 
numerous 
times on topics such as flood insur-
ance, agent licensing, and terrorism in-
surance. Additionally, he is a member 
of the TrustedChoice.com board and 
represents the Big ‘‘I’’ on the World 
Federation 
of 
Insurance 
Inter-
mediaries, WFII. Jensen was sworn in 
as WFII’s chairman in 2019 in Rome, 
the first time a Big ‘‘I’’ representative 
has chaired the organization. 
As an active leader and philan-
thropist in his community, Jensen 
serves on the board of the Spartanburg 
Regional 
Foundation’s—SRF—cancer 
division, as well as SRF’s grants and 
allocations committee, and he is a 
founding member of SRF’s Legacy So-
ciety. 
The State of South Carolina is proud 
of Jon Jensen and wishes him, his wife 
Julie, and his two children well fol-
lowing his successful term as chairman 
of the Big ‘‘I.’’∑

SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 13 
Whereas, On February 1, Myanmar’s mili-
tary seized control of the nation’s govern-
ment and detained the democratically elect-
ed civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. Suu 
Kyi and other prominent members of the rul-
ing National League for Democracy (NLD) 
were taken into custody at gunpoint. The 
U.S. State Department has officially de-
clared the takeover a coup d’etat; and 
Whereas, Since taking power, the military 
has assailed the basic rights of a free society, 
including the freedoms of speech, assembly, 
and religion, and the right to petition the 
government for redress of grievances. Promi-
nent members of civil society, including 
monks and artists, have been detained while 
other activists have gone into hiding out of 
fear that they would be targeted, Soldiers 
have indicated those who participate in pro-
tests would be arrested; and 
Whereas, These freedoms, along with the 
right to free and fair elections, are crucial to 
any free society. This coup d’etat threatens 
Myanmar’s 
recent 
progress 
after 
transitioning out of military rule and hold-
ing its first elections in 2015: Now, therefore,

Resolved by the Senate, That we stand with

by the Legislature of the State of Arizona 
urging the United States Congress and the 
President of the United States to secure the 
southern border; to the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Affairs. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 1011 
Whereas, the southern border consists of 
1,954 miles of varied terrain, including 
deserts, rugged mountainous areas, forests 
and coastal areas: and 
Whereas, officially established in 1924 by 
an act of Congress in response to increasing 
illegal immigration, the United States Bor-
der Patrol has primary responsibility for se-
curing the border between ports of entry: 
and 
Whereas, 
Border 
Patrol 
agents 
patrol 
international land borders and waterways to 
detect and prevent the illegal trafficking of 
people, narcotics and contraband into the 
United States: and 
Whereas, the southern border of the United 
States is experiencing unprecedented num-
bers of individuals attempting to enter the 
country illegally: and 
Whereas, there has been a major increase 
in both apprehensions and expulsions on the 
southwest border with Border Patrol agents 
making approximately 168,000 arrests at the 
border in March of 2021, compared with ap-
proximately 71,000 in December of 2020: and 
Whereas, many people are smuggled into 
the United States, by ‘‘coyotes’’ and crimi-
nal syndicates, in abusive, cruel and unsafe 
conditions, many times under false promises: 
and 
Whereas, in January through March of 
2021, the Border Patrol encountered more 
than 19,000 unaccompanied minors; and 
Whereas, the Border Patrol is holding over 
3,000 children in detention, a record high; 
and 
Whereas, an uncontrolled border is a secu-
rity and humanitarian crises, endangering 
the safety of American citizens with the 
harmful threat of COVID–19 (SARS-CoV–2) 
and subjecting unaccompanied minors to 
poor conditions; and 
Whereas, the Biden administration has 
halted construction of a southern border 
wall, and there are numerous unfinished sec-
tions in Arizona; and 
Whereas, the Biden administration is not 
working collaboratively nor in good faith 
with local law enforcement agencies and 
other state leaders to address issues related 
to the border; and 
Whereas, Governor Ducey in April of 2021 
declared a state of emergency along Arizo-
na’s southern border and is sending Arizona 
National Guard troops to support local law 
enforcement there: Therefore be it 
Resolved, By the Senate of the State of Ari-
zona, the House of Representatives concur-
ring: 
1. That the Members of the Legislature call 
on the President and Congress to take imme-
diate and decisive action to secure the south-
ern border and stymie the security and hu-
manitarian crises associated with any fur-
ther illegal immigration and to as quickly as 
possible shore up the southern border by 
completing the southern border wall. 
2. That the Members of the Legislature 
support the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives and President of the Senate in

commission to provide a forum where testi-
mony can be taken regarding the inter-

kota urging federal authorities to observe 
and respect the principles of federalism and 
limits on federal power prescribed by the 
Constitution of the United States; to the

HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3029 
Whereas, the Constitution of the United 
States delegates certain enumerated powers 
to the federal government and reserves all 
others, unless prohibited by the Constitu-
tion, to the states and to the people; and 
Whereas, the principle of limited federal 
authority is the cornerstone of state and fed-
eral relations in the United States; and 
Whereas, vigilant protection of the appro-
priate, historic, constitutional authority of 
states within the United States of America 
is foundational to our American form of gov-

freedoms; and 
Whereas, the State of North Dakota long

resentatives. 
POM–49. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of West Vir-
ginia urging the United States Congress to 
call a convention of the states, under the au-
thority reserved to the states in Article V of 
the United States Constitution, limited to 
proposing amendments to the Constitution 
of the United States to set a limit on the 
number of terms that a person may be elect-
ed as a member of the United States House 
of Representatives or as a member of the 
United States Senate; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 9 
Whereas, The Legislature of West Virginia 
hereby makes an application to Congress, as 
provided by Article V of the Constitution of 
the United States, to call a convention lim-
ited to proposing an amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States to set a limit 
on the number of terms that a person may be 
elected as a member of the United States 
House of Representatives, and to set a limit 
on the number of terms that a person may be 
elected as a member of the United States 
Senate; and 
Whereas, This application shall be consid-
ered as covering the same subject matter as 
the applications from other states to Con-
gress to call a convention to set a limit on 
the number of terms that a person may be 
elected to the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States and the 
Senate of the United States; and this appli-
cation shall be aggregated with same for the 
purpose of attaining the two-thirds of states 
necessary to require Congress to call a lim-
ited convention on this subject, but shall not 
be aggregated with any other applications on 
any other subject; and 
Whereas, This application constitutes a 
continuing application in accordance with 
Article V of the Constitution of the United 
States until the legislatures of at least two- 
thirds of the several states have made appli-
cations on the same subject; therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Legislature of West Vir-
ginia: That the Legislature hereby urges 
Congress to call a convention of the states, 
under the authority reserved to the states in 
Article V of the United States Constitution, 
limited to proposing amendments to the 
Constitution of the United States to call a 
convention limited to proposing an amend-
ment to the Constitution of the United 
States of America to set a limit on the num-
ber of terms that a person may be elected as 
a member of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives or as a member of the United 
States Senate; and, be it further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House is 
hereby directed to forward copies of this res-
olution to the President and Secretary of the 
Senate of the United States and to the 
Speaker, Clerk, and Judiciary Committee 
Chairman of the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States, and copies 
to the members of the said Senate and House 
of Representatives from this state; also to 
forward copies thereof to the presiding offi-
cers of each of the legislative houses in the 
several states, requesting their cooperation. 
POM–50. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the 
United States Congress and the President of 
the United States to oppose H.R. 1 and simi-
lar harmful election policy measures; to the 
Committee on Rules and Administration. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 25 
Whereas, Free and fair elections are vital 
to our country but only possible with pru-
dent laws in place. Our electoral system 
must be safeguarded from fraud and irreg-
ularities, including laws that enhance the 
possibility and probability for such harms; 
and 
Whereas, Introduced in Congress, H.R. 1 of 
2021 would enshrine into law many misguided 
election policies. H.R. 1 would impede the 
maintenance of accurate voter registration 
lists and the enforcement of sensible voter 
identification standards. Additionally, the 
legislation would greatly enable the practice 
of ballot harvesting, which is currently ille-
gal in our state. These and other provisions 
in H.R. 1 would greatly undermine the integ-
rity of our elections; and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 represents a massive fed-
eral overreach into state election policy. The 
U.S. Constitution empowers state legisla-
tures to set election laws, and each state 
knows best how to conduct its elections. 
H.R. 1 is an unwanted and unnecessary fed-
eral power grab that infringes on state au-
thority to administer elections and threat-
ens local control; and 
Whereas, On March 7, 2021, President Joe 
Biden signed an executive order that unnec-
essarily expands the federal government’s 
role in voter registration activities that are 
best handled by states and wrongly directs 
federal resources into other election mat-
ters; and 
Whereas, Election reform efforts should 
focus on ensuring that the system is safe, se-
cure, and fair. Citizens deserve to know that 
the outcome of elections are free from fraud 
and irregularities; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the 
United States Congress and the President of 
the United States to oppose H.R. 1 and simi-
lar harmful election policy measures; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the President of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, and the members 
of the Michigan congressional delegation. 
POM–51. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona 
memorializing its opposition to any federal 
action infringing on Arizona’s Constitutional 
power to manage, control, and administer 
elections; to the Committee on Rules and 
Administration. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 2023 
Whereas, the Constitution of the United 
States vests power in the states to manage, 
control and administer each state’s own elec-
tion laws; and 
Whereas, the power over elections was pre-
served explicitly for the states by the Con-
stitution; and 
Whereas, this power was not delegated to 
the states by the federal government; and 
Whereas, rare exceptions in the Constitu-
tion, such as the Elections Clause, the Fif-
teenth Amendment, the Nineteenth Amend-
ment, the Twenty-fourth Amendment and 
the Twenty-sixth Amendment, do not extin-
guish the constitutional presumption that 
states have the constitutional power to set 
the terms of administering the election, des-
ignating electors and establishing other laws 
and protocols related to the election; and 
Whereas, the Elections Clause of the Con-
stitution was intended to prevent the states 
from suffocating the existence of the govern-
ment of the United States, and no such con-
templated effort has occurred; and 
Whereas, the Elections Clause was to be 
sparingly used to intrude on state power to 
manage, control and administer state elec-
tions; and 
Whereas, House Resolution 1 (H.R. 1), a bill 
introduced in the United States Congress, 
would obliterate the constitutional arrange-
ment between the states and the government 
of the United States by usurping the con-
stitutional power of states to manage, con-
trol and administer state elections by pro-
hibiting various practices and mandating 
others such as forcing states to conduct an 
election over an extended period of time, 
prohibiting states from maintaining voter 
rolls free from error and obsolete informa-
tion and forcing states to accept an elector 
who does not register to vote in advance, 
mandates related to mail voting, prohibi-
tions against regulating ballot harvesting 
and scores of other intrusions into the power 
of states to manage, control and administer 
their elections; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5100 
July 27, 2021 
Whereas, H.R. 1 strikes at the very heart of 
the arrangement that gave rise to this na-
tion, namely that states are sovereign and 
free from interference and the intrusion of 
power from the government of the United 
States absent clear constitutional authoriza-
tion. Therefore be it 
Resolved, By the House of Representatives 
of the State of Arizona, the Senate concur-
ring: 
1. That the Members of the Legislature op-
pose any attempt by the federal government 
to usurp, or otherwise interfere with, the 
state legislative sovereign authority over 
the management, control and administration 
of elections. 
2. That the Members of the Legislature op-
pose H.R. 1 and any subsequent enactment of 
the terms of this proposal and implore the 
Members of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and the United States Senate to 
oppose the same. 
3. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit a copy of this Resolu-
tion to the President of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, each Member of 
Congress from the State of Arizona and each 
Speaker of the House of the Representatives 
and each President Senate of the other state 
legislatures. 
POM–52. A memorial adopted by the Legis-
lature of the State of Arizona urging the 
United States Congress to provide funding to 
assist service members of the United States 
Armed Forces who are survivors of sexual as-
sault; to the Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs. 
HOUSE MEMORIAL NO. 2001 
To the Congress of the United States of 
America: 
Your memorialist respectfully represents: 
Whereas, the United States Department of 
Defense’s annual report on sexual assault in 
the military, which was provided to Congress 
in 2020, stated that there continues to be ex-
tensive sexual harassment and sexual assault 
in the United States armed forces: and 
Whereas, statistics on military sexual as-
saults mentioned in the report show that the 
majority of service member sexual assault 
survivors are between the ages of 17 and 24 
and work, train or live in close proximity to 
their alleged attackers; and 
Whereas, sexual assaults in the military 
continue to be underreported even as report-
ing rates have quadrupled over the last dec-
ade; and 
Whereas, United States armed forces serv-
ice members who survive military sexual as-
sault should be supported by the United 
States Department of Defense’s judicial and 
medical systems at the time of service and 
be educated on available services once they 
have separated from the military; and 
Whereas, service members who have honor-
ably served in the United States armed 
forces should be provided with the services 
they have earned to assist with the trauma 
of military sexual assault. Wherefore your 
memorialist, the House of Representatives of 
the State of 
Arizona, prays: 
1. That the United States Congress support 
the survivors of military sexual assault 
through funding and gender-specific health 
transition training. 
2. That the United States Congress provide 
funding to the United States Department of 
Veterans Affairs for extensive outreach to 
those service members who are separating 
from the armed forces and provide continued 
funding for modernizing Department of Vet-
erans Affairs and Department of Defense 
health records. 
3. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial 
to the President of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives and each member of Con-
gress from the State of Arizona. 
POM–53. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Hawaii 
urging the United States Congress to grant 
additional authority to the Federal Commu-
nications Commission to stop unwanted and 
illegal robocalls; to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 45 
Whereas, receipt of unwanted telephone 
calls is among the most frequent complaints 
received by the Federal Communications 
Commission from consumers nationwide; and 
Whereas, unwanted calls include auto-
mated telemarketing or solicitation calls 
that deliver a recorded message, also known 
as robocalls; and 
Whereas, recently, robocalls have been 
combined with a process called ‘‘spoofing’’, 
by which robocalls appear to originate from 
local, often legitimate, numbers to trick 
consumers into answering the robocalls; and 
Whereas, 
as 
technology 
continues 
to 
evolve, the number of robocalls and spoofing 
continues to grow; and 
Whereas, under the Federal Truth in Caller 
ID Act of 2009, individuals are prohibited 
from transmitting misleading or inaccurate 
caller ID information with the intent to de-
fraud, cause harm, or wrongly obtain any-
thing of value; and 
Whereas, despite the fact that the Federal 
Communications Commission has initiated 
new policy initiatives to combat robocalls 
and spoofing, additional measures need to be 
implemented to combat this growing prob-
lem; and 
Whereas, 
the 
United 
States 
Congress 
should pass legislation that provides the 
Federal Communications Commission with 
the tools and resources it needs to combat 
robocalls and spoofing; and 
Whereas, 
the 
Federal 
Communications 
Commission encourages consumers to file a 
complaint with the Federal Communications 
Commission when a robocall is received; and 
Whereas, although the Federal Commu-
nications Commission uses social media and 
the Internet to reach consumers, the Federal 
Communications Commission should use all 
means available to provide consumers with 
the information necessary to file a com-
plaint; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, By the House of Representatives 
of the Thirty-first Legislature of the State of 
Hawaii, Regular Session of 2021, the Senate 
concurring, that the United States Congress 
is urged to grant additional authority to the 
Federal 
Communications 
Commission 
to 
stop unwanted and illegal robocalls; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Con-
current Resolution be transmitted to the 
President Pro Tempore of the United States 
Senate, Speaker of the United States House 
of Representatives, members of the Hawaii 
congressional delegation, and Chair of the 
Federal Communications Commission. 
POM–54. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Hawaii 
urging the United States Congress, Federal 
Aviation Administration, and Hawaii De-
partment of Transportation to take every 
action necessary to address rapidly increas-
ing safety risks and community disruption 
resulting from insufficient regulation of tour 
helicopter and small aircraft operations 
throughout Hawaii skies; to the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 81 
Whereas, the volume and extent of tour 
helicopter and small aircraft operations 
throughout Hawaii’s skies have rapidly in-
creased in the past decade; and 
Whereas, with such increases, the safety 
risks to helicopter and small aircraft pas-
sengers, and to the Hawaii residents and visi-
tors that the helicopters and small aircraft 
fly over daily, have rapidly increased; and 
Whereas, tour helicopters and small air-
craft in Hawaii’s skies, through noise, vibra-
tion, and visual impacts, have increasingly 
disrupted residential, business, and indus-
trial communities; state and national parks, 
such as Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and 
Haleakala National Park; defense areas, such 
as Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam; ceme-
teries and areas of solemnity, such as the 
National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific 
and Pearl Harbor National Memorial; and 
areas of critical infrastructure; and 
Whereas, 
the 
National 
Transportation 
Safety Board (NTSB), which is the federal 
agency responsible for investigating aircraft 
collisions and making recommendations on 
improving the safety of aircraft operations, 
found that Hawaii tour helicopter and small 
aircraft operations accounted for nearly sev-
enteen percent of the nationwide accidents 
that prompted investigations by the NTSB 
over the last five years; and 
Whereas, within a ten-month period alone, 
twenty-three lives were lost through the fol-
lowing tour helicopter and small aircraft 
collisions in the State: 
(1) on April 29, 2019, a tour helicopter 
crashed into a residential neighborhood in 
Kailua, Oahu, killing three people; 
(2) On June 21, 2019, a commercial small 
aircraft crashed at Mokuleia, Oahu, killing 
eleven people; 
(3) On December 27, 2019, a tour helicopter 
crashed on Kauai, killing seven people; and 
(4) On February 22, 2020, a commercial 
small aircraft crashed at Mokuleia, Oahu, 
killing two people; and 
Whereas, over the past decade, tour heli-
copters and small aircraft have been in-
volved in several other incidents that, while 
not fatal, nevertheless constituted severe 
risks to the passengers, residents, and visi-
tors on the ground; and 
Whereas, these disruptions and crashes are 
largely the result of a lack of effective fed-
eral regulations and a lack of self-regulation 
in the tour helicopter and small aircraft in-
dustry; and 
Whereas, effective regulations to eliminate 
or mitigate ground disruptions would place 
restrictions on the time, routes, altitude, 
and frequency of helicopter and small air-
craft operations; and 
Whereas, communities would be safer and 
would face fewer disruptions from tour heli-
copter and small aircraft operations if exist-
ing federal acts and regulations, including 
the following, were used to their full extent: 
(1) The National Park Air Tour Manage-
ment Act of 2000, as amended, which requires 
operators conducting commercial air tours 
over national parks to operate pursuant to 
an air tour management plan issued by the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and 
National Park Service, or in lieu of such a 
plan, pursuant to a voluntary agreement 
with the agencies; 
(2) The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 
1990, which establishes the FAA’s authority 
over airport owners’ noise restrictions; and 
(3) Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
part 50, which regulates the FAA’s airport 
noise compatibility planning programs; and 
Whereas, the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in 
the case of In Re: Public Employees for Envi-
ronmental Responsibility and Hawaii Coali-
tion Malama Pono in May 2020, ordered the 
FAA and National Park Service to bring all 
required national parks into compliance 
with the National Park Air Tour Manage-
ment Act of 2000, including Hawaii Volcanoes

National Park and Haleakala National Park, 
within two years; and 
Whereas, the FAA largely asserts that it 
has exclusive jurisdiction over regulating 
the nation’s airspace and aircraft operations, 
which means that the FAA, not the State, 
has the sole power and responsibility to es-
tablish and enforce restrictions that would 
prevent tour helicopter and small aircraft 
operations from disrupting communities; 
and 
Whereas, although the NTSB has made 
various safety recommendations to the FAA 
that would apply to tour helicopter and 
small aircraft operations, the board is still 
waiting for an acceptable response from the 
FAA on a number of the recommendations; 
and 
Whereas, following the April 29, 2019, crash 
in Kailua, the Chair of the NTSB stated that 
‘‘each crash underscores the urgency of im-
proving the safety of charter flights by im-
plementing 
existing 
[NTSB] 
safety 
rec-
ommendations’’, and called for small aircraft 
flight safety improvements; and 
Whereas, the FAA is currently in the proc-
ess of archiving the Hawaii Air Tour Com-
mon Procedures Manual and replacing it 
with a new regulatory process for deter-
mining when and how tour flights can devi-
ate below fifteen hundred feet in altitude, 
which they are otherwise required to be 
above; and 
Whereas, the FAA, Hawaii Department of 
Transportation, some Hawaii tour helicopter 
companies, 
and 
other 
interested 
stake-
holders have formed the Hawaii Air Noise 
and Safety Task Force with the stated in-
tent of addressing increasing safety and com-
munity disruption concerns, but are not 
fully engaging and responding to public con-
cerns in determining regulatory or voluntary 
changes in operations; and 
Whereas, an increasing number of elected 
officials and community organizations have 
expressed growing concern with safety risks 
and community disruption arising from tour 
helicopter and small aircraft operations; and 
Whereas, Ed Case, Representative for the 
First Congressional District of Hawaii, has 
introduced legislation in the United States 
House of Representatives, H.R. No. 389, 117th 
Congress (First Session 2021) with a short 
title of the ‘‘Safe and Quiet Skies Act’’; and 
Whereas, if enacted, H.R. No. 389 would, in 
pertinent part: 
(1) Prohibit commercial air tours from op-
erating over or within a half mile of espe-
cially sensitive locations; 
(2) Require the FAA to require the use of 
automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast 
out equipment during the entire operation of 
a commercial air tour; 
(3) Require the FAA to prohibit pilots from 
undertaking any activities other than flying 
the aircraft, including monitoring video 
equipment or narrating, during the oper-
ation of a commercial air tour; 
(4) Impose minimum altitude requirements 
and noise restrictions on commercial air 
tours; 
(5) Authorize state and local jurisdictions 
to impose additional requirements on com-
mercial air tours; 
(6) Require the FAA to implement any rec-
ommendations issued by the NTSB con-
cerning operators of commercial aircraft on 
which the FAA has not provided an accept-
able response to the board; and 
(7) Require the FAA to subject commercial 
air tour operators to certain regulations re-
lating to commercial aircraft operators, in-
stead of regulations relating to non-commer-
cial aircraft operators; and 
Whereas, on January 31, 2020, the United 
States Senate Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation released a re-
port entitled, ‘‘Whistleblower Allegations of 
Misconduct at the FAA Flight Standards 
District Office in Honolulu, Hawaii’’, out-
lining multiple whistleblower claims of inad-
equate safety regulation of tour helicopters, 
specifically including those involved in the 
fatal crashes in Kailua on April 29, 2019, and 
on Kauai on December 27, 2019; and 
Whereas, the Honolulu City Council and 
nineteen of Oahu’s neighborhood boards have 
taken official actions to urge the federal 
government to act to address the disruptions 
and dangers posed by tour helicopter and 
small aircraft operations; and 
Whereas, the lack of effective federal regu-
lations and the lack of effective self-regula-
tion by the tour helicopter and small air-
craft industry pose a significant and growing 
threat to the safety, health, and well-being 
of the nation and the State; now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, By the House of Representatives 
of the Thirty-first Legislature of the State of 
Hawaii, Regular Session of 2021, the Senate 
concurring, that the United States Congress, 
FAA, and Hawaii Department of Transpor-
tation are urged to take every action nec-
essary to address rapidly increasing safety 
risks and community disruption resulting 
from insufficient regulation of rapidly in-
creasing operations of tour helicopters and 
small aircraft throughout Hawaii skies; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That the United States Congress 
is urged to promptly enact the proposed Safe 
and Quiet Skies Act; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Hawaii Department of 
Transportation and FAA are urged to pursue 
existing remedies to limit community dis-
ruption through the Airport Noise and Ca-
pacity Act of 1990 and title 14 Code of Fed-
eral Regulations part 150; and be it further 
Resolved, That the FAA is urged to: 
(1) Implement any recommendations issued 
by the NTSB concerning operators of com-
mercial aircraft on which the FAA has not 
provided an acceptable response to the 
Board; 
(2) Fully implement, in concert with the 
National Park Service, the requirements of 
the National Park Air Tour Management Act 
of 2000 with respect to all applicable Hawaii 
parks and other relevant areas as required 
by the United States Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia Circuit; and 
(3) Immediately and fully investigate whis-
tleblowers’ claims with respect to the Hono-
lulu Flight Standards District Office’s imple-
mentation of safety requirements; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That the Hawaii Air Noise and 
Safety Task Force is urged to immediately 
respond substantively to public safety and 
community disruption concerns with clear 
changes to operations to reduce time, place, 
and manner of operations; and be it further 
Resolved, That federal, state, and county 
elected and administration officials are 
urged to pursue these actions, the enactment 
of legislation to authorize state and local 
governments to regulate helicopter and 
small aircraft operations, and all other ac-
tions that will enhance safety and prevent 
community disruption by Hawaii tour heli-
copter and small aircraft operations; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Con-
current Resolution be transmitted to the 
Speaker of the House of the United States 
House of Representatives; Majority Leader of 
the United States Senate; members of Ha-
waii’s 
congressional 
delegation; 
United 
States Secretary of Transportation; Admin-
istrator of the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion; Manager of the Honolulu Flight Stand-
ards District Office of the Federal Aviation 
Administration; Chair of the National Trans-
portation Safety Board; Director of the Na-
tional Park Service; Governor; Hawaii Direc-
tor of Transportation; mayor of each county; 
chair of each neighborhood board; and co- 
chairs of the Hawaii Air Noise and Safety 
Task Force.

State of Texas relative to national security; 
to the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation. 
POM–56. A resolution adopted by the House 
of Representatives of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress to take 
such actions as are necessary to compel the 
Federal Aviation Administration to protect 
the rights of consumers by setting consistent 
standards across airlines for passenger bag-
gage and other ancillary fees; to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 221 
Whereas, the United States Congress large-
ly determines the degree to which certain 
rights of airline passengers are codified in 
law or developed through regulatory rule-
making; and 
Whereas, in 2008, the first major United 
States carrier imposed a fee for checked bag-
gage; and 
Whereas, all major carriers now charge an 
additional fee for checked baggage with the 
exception of Southwest airlines subject to 
weight requirements; and 
Whereas, airlines have been under finan-
cial pressure to offset the cost of rising fuel 
prices, and many airlines now charge excess 
baggage fees for checking one or more pieces 
of luggage, with some even charging for 
carry-ons; and 
Whereas, in 2018, several airlines raised the 
fee for the first checked bag from twenty- 
five to thirty dollars, which amounts to a 
twenty percent increase; and 
Whereas, airlines’ bag and reservation fee 
collections have increased every year for 
more than a decade; and 
Whereas, airlines’ bag fees have exceeded 
one billion every quarter for more than three 
years with the exception of the second 
through fourth quarters in 2020 due to the 
pandemic; and 
Whereas, in 2019, the Bureau of Transpor-
tation Statistics reported that airlines col-
lectively generated eight billion six hundred 
million in baggage and other ancillary fees; 
and 
Whereas, in 2019, the Bureau of Transpor-
tation Statistics reported that airlines col-
lectively generated two billion eight million 
in reservation change fees; and 
Whereas, many airline passengers have ex-
pressed concerns over baggage policies that 
are inconsistent across airlines; and 
Whereas, airline baggage fees have become 
progressively more confusing, complicated, 
and expensive; and 
Whereas, although baggage fees are dis-
played on the airlines’ websites, consumers 
report that additional hidden fees are not 
mentioned; and 
Whereas, certain airlines charge up to 
forty-five dollars for carry-on bags and have 
additional complications; and 
Whereas, airline baggage fees can vary de-
pending on when and where passengers add 
bags; and 
Whereas, one of the top ten customer com-
plaints about the airline industry is hidden 
charges and cost; and 
Whereas, the aforementioned concerns of 
airline passengers are issues of consumer 
protection for which the United State Con-
gress has the constitutional power to address 
and determine fair and reasonable solutions 
through codified law and regulatory rule-
making: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives of the Legislature of Louisiana does

tration to set consistent standards across 
airlines for baggage and other ancillary fees 
that are reasonable and proportional to the 
cost of services to eliminate airlines’ poten-
tial for price gouging; and be it further 
Resolved, That the United State Congress 
should consider enacting legislation that ad-
dresses the issues of transparency by man-
dating that airlines disclose hidden fees so 
that consumers can obtain an all inclusive 
airfare price; and be it further 
Resolved, That the United State Congress 
should also consider legislation that pro-
hibits airlines from charging fees on carry- 
on baggage which meets existing restrictions 
on the weight, size, and number of bags; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That the United State Congress 
should consider directing the appropriate 
federal agency to conduct an audit on air-
lines’ policies relative to baggage and other 
ancillary fees; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the United States Congress and to each 
member of the Louisiana congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–57. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Missouri 
urging the United States Congress to resist 
any attempt to increase the number of Jus-
tices on the United States Supreme Court; to 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 6 
Whereas, an independent United States Su-
preme Court is an essential clement of Amer-
ica’s system or checks and balances that pro-
tects our constitutional rights; and 
Whereas, the United States Supreme Court 
has been composed of nine Justices for more 
than 150 years; and 
Whereas, the President of the United 
States and Congress should be prohibited 
from undermining the independence of the 
Supreme Court by changing the number of 
Justices on the Supreme Court: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the members of the Missouri 
Senate, One Hundred First General Assem-
bly, First Regular Session, the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring therein, hereby urge 
the United States Congress to resist any at-
tempt to increase: the number of Justices on 
the United States Supreme Court; and be it 
further 
Resolved That the Secretary of the Senate 
be instructed to prepare properly inscribed 
copies of this resolution for the President of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives and 
the members of the Missouri Congressional 
delegation. 
POM–58. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Missouri 
applying to the United States Congress, 
under the provisions of Article V of the 
United States Constitution, for the calling of 
a convention of the states limited to pro-
posing amendments to the United States 
Constitution that impose fiscal restraints on 
the federal government, limit the power and 
jurisdiction of the federal government, and 
limit the terms of office for its officials and 
members of Congress; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4 
Whereas, the Founders of our Constitution 
empowered state legislators to be guardians 
of liberty against future abuses of power by 
the federal government; and 
Whereas, the federal government has cre-
ated a crushing national debt through im-
proper and imprudent spending; and 
Whereas, the federal government has in-
vaded the legitimate roles of the states 
through the manipulative process of federal 
mandates, most of which are unfunded to a 
great extent; and 
Whereas, 
the 
federal 
government 
has 
ceased to live under a proper interpretation 
of the Constitution of the United States; and 
Whereas, it is the solemn duty of the 
states to protect the liberty of our people— 
particularly for the generations to come—to 
propose amendments to the United States 
Constitution through a convention of states 
under Article V to place clear restraints on 
these and related abuses of power; and 
Whereas, the Ninety-Ninth General Assem-
bly of Missouri, First Regular Session, 
adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4. 
which contained an application for an Arti-
cle V Convention to propose constitutional 
amendments identical to those proposed in 
this resolution. but provided that the appli-
cation would expire five years after the pas-
sage of Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, By the members of the Missouri 
Senate, One Hundred First General Assem-
bly, First Regular Session, the House of Rep-
resentatives 
concurring 
therein, 
hereby 
apply to Congress, under the provisions or 
Article V of the United States Constitution, 
for the calling of a convention of the states 
limited to proposing amendments to the 
United States Constitution that impose fis-
cal restraints on the federal government, 
limit the power and jurisdiction of the fed-
eral government, and limit the terms of of-
fice for its officials and members of Con-
gress; and be it further 
Resolved, 
That 
the 
General 
Assembly 
adopts this application with the following 
understandings 
(as 
the 
term 
‘‘under-
standings’’ is used within the context of 
‘‘reservations, understandings, and declara-
tions’’): 
(1) An application to Congress for an Arti-
cle V convention confers no power on Con-
gress other than to perform a ministerial 
function to ‘‘call’’ for a convention; 
(2) This ministerial duty shall be per-
formed by Congress only when Article V ap-
plications for substantially the same purpose 
are received from two-thirds of the legisla-
tures of the several states; 
(3) The power of Congress to ‘‘call’’ a con-
vention solely consists of the authority to 
name a reasonable time and place for the ini-
tial meeting of the convention; 
(4) Congress possesses no power whatsoever 
to name delegates to the convention, as this 
power remains exclusively within the au-
thority of the legislatures of the several 
states; 
(5) Congress possesses no power to set the 
number of delegates to be sent by any states; 
(6) Congress possesses no power whatsoever 
to determine any rules for such convention; 
(7) By definition, a Convention of States 
means that states vote on the basis of one 
state, one vote; 
(8) A Convention of States convened pursu-
ant to this application is limited to consider-
ation of topics specified herein and no other; 
(9) The General Assembly of Missouri may 
recall its delegates at any time for breach of 
their duties or violations of their instruc-
tions pursuant to the procedures adopted in 
this resolution; 
(10) Pursuant to the text of Article V, Con-
gress 
may 
determine 
whether 
proposed 
amendments shall be ratified by the legisla-
tures of the several states or by special state 
ratification conventions. The General As-
sembly of Missouri recommends that Con-
gress specify its choice on ratification meth-
odology contemporaneously with the call for 
the convention; 
(11) Congress possesses no power whatso-
ever with regard to the Article V convention 
beyond the two powers acknowledged herein; 
(12) Missouri places express reliance on 
prior legal and judicial determinations that 
Congress possesses no power under Article I 
relative to the Article V process, and that 
Congress must act only as expressly specified 
in Article V; and be it further 
Resolved, That this application hereby re-
peals, rescinds, cancels, renders null and 
void, and supercedes the application to the 
Congress of the United States for a conven-
tion under Article V of the Constitution of 
the United States by this state in Senate 
Concurrent Resolution No. 4 as adopted by 
the Ninety-Ninth General Assembly, First 
Regular Session; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate 
be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed 
copy of this resolution for the President and 
Secretary of the United States Senate, the 
Speaker and Clerk of the United States 
House of Representatives, each member of 
the Missouri Congressional delegation, and 
the presiding officers of each of the legisla-
tive houses in the several states requesting 
their cooperation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5107 
July 27, 2021 
Whereas, according to NHTSA, 6,205 pedes-
trians were killed in traffic crashes the 
United States in 2019, representing a 13 per-
cent increase in the last 5 years; 
Whereas, according to NHTSA, the number 
of pedestrian fatalities increased by 44 per-
cent from 2010 to 2019; 
Whereas, according to the National Com-
plete Streets Coalition at Smart Growth 
America, the pedestrian fatality rate for 
American Indian and Alaska Native people is 
221 percent higher than that of White, non- 
Hispanic people in the United States, and 
Black people were struck and killed by driv-
ers at a 82 percent higher rate than White, 
non-Hispanic people in the United States; 
Whereas, according to NHTSA, a total of 
843 bicyclists were killed in crashes with 
motor vehicles in 2019, representing a 36 per-
cent increase in the last 10 years; 
Whereas independent research in 2015 found 
that motor vehicle crash death rates were as 
much as 4.3 times greater for those at the 
bottom of the education spectrum than those 
at the top; 
Whereas, according to NHTSA, motor-
cycles represented only 3 percent of all reg-
istered vehicles, but accounted for 14 percent 
of all traffic fatalities and 17 percent of all 
occupant fatalities in 2019; 
Whereas, according to NHTSA, in 2019, 45 
percent of motor vehicle traffic fatalities oc-
curred on rural roads, despite only 30 percent 
of miles traveled occurring on rural roads; 
Whereas, according to NHTSA, seatbelts 
saved 14,955 lives in 2017 but lack of universal 
seatbelt usage costs the economy of the 
United States $10,000,000,000 annually; 
Whereas, according to NHTSA, in 2019, 47 
percent of passenger vehicle occupants who 
died in a motor vehicle crash were unre-
strained, while 86 percent of occupants who 
survived a motor vehicle crash were re-
strained; 
Whereas, according to the Insurance Insti-
tute for Highway Safety, increasing speed 
limits over the last 25 years have led to ap-
proximately 37,000 deaths; 
Whereas, according to NHTSA, speeding 
accounted for 26 percent of all traffic fatali-
ties in 2019; 
Whereas, according to Consumer Reports, 
existing safety technologies could cut road 
fatalities in half if such technologies were 
made standard on all vehicles, saving ap-
proximately 20,000 lives annually; 
Whereas roadway fatalities and injuries 
rose during the COVID–19 pandemic and re-
main a persistent killer on the roadways of 
our Nation; 
Whereas, a deep history of inequalities in 
the United States continues to impact trans-
portation systems, with low-income neigh-
borhoods experiencing more than twice as 
many pedestrian fatalities as neighborhoods 
with the highest incomes, according to the 
National Complete Streets Coalition at 
Smart Growth America; 
Whereas too many families in the United 
States have been personally affected by pre-
ventable crashes; and 
Whereas a data-driven safe systems ap-
proach is proven to be effective at reducing 
traffic fatalities and injuries, including 
through taking into account all aspects of 
the transportation environment and not re-
quiring a single actor to be responsible for 
traffic safety: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commits to advancing policies that will 
end roadway fatalities by 2050; 
(2) calls on Congress and the Department 
of Transportation to commit to working to-
gether to achieve zero roadway fatalities by 
the year 2050; 
(3) supports efforts to address disparities 
and other equity-related issues related to 
transportation safety; 
(4) calls on the Department of Transpor-
tation, and the agencies within the Depart-
ment of Transportation, to improve data 
gathering and tracking of traffic crashes and 
other issues related to transportation safety; 
(5) calls on the Department of Transpor-
tation, and the agencies within the Depart-
ment of Transportation, to commit to the 
implementation of proven countermeasures 
and interventions to prioritize transpor-

TECTING MINORITY RIGHTS 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. COR-
NYN, Mr. WICKER, and Mr. TILLIS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 322 
Whereas Bulgaria, which is an original sig-
natory of the Conference on Security and Co-
operation in Europe, done at Helsinki Au-
gust 1, 1975 (commonly known as the ‘‘Hel-
sinki Final Act’’)— 
(1) has transitioned from a Cold War-era, 
Soviet satellite to a multi-party democracy 
with a market economy; and 
(2) remains an active and constructive par-
ticipant in the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE); 
Whereas because of its progress on the in-
stitutionalization of democratic systems and 
economic reforms, Bulgaria joined the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 
and the European Union in 2007; 
Whereas Bulgaria is a steadfast ally of the 
United States in an area of strategic impor-
tance to the United States; 
Whereas bilateral security cooperation be-
tween the United States and Bulgaria is deep 
and growing stronger, including through the 
October 2020 signing of a 10-year defense co-
operation 
roadmap, 
and 
regular 
United 
States military training conducted in Bul-
garia, including at the Novo Selo Training 
Area; 
Whereas Bulgaria has contributed approxi-
mately 21,000 troops to various NATO mis-
sions; 
Whereas Bulgaria is on track to consist-
ently reach defense spending of at least 2 
percent of its gross domestic product by 2024; 
Whereas the international observers rep-
resenting the OSCE Office for Democratic In-
stitutions and Human Rights, the OSCE Par-
liamentary Assembly, and the Parliamen-
tary Assembly of the Council of Europe con-
cluded that Bulgaria’s July 11, 2021 par-
liamentary elections were ‘‘competitive with 
fundamental freedoms generally respected’’; 
Whereas on July 8 and 9, 2021, Bulgaria 
hosted the annual summit meeting of the 
Three Seas Initiative, a unique region-led 
undertaking launched in 2015 to create a po-
litical platform and investment fund to pro-
mote transportation, energy, and digital in-
frastructure connectivity across its 12 mem-
ber 
states 
(Austria, 
Bulgaria, 
Croatia, 
Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lith-
uania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slo-
venia); 
Whereas Bulgaria’s continued progress has 
been threatened by multiple internal chal-
lenges, including corruption, and Bulgaria is 
consistently among the lowest-ranked Euro-
pean Union member states in Transparency 
International’s 
Corruption 
Perceptions 
Index; 
Whereas Bulgaria was ranked 112th out of 
180 countries in the Reporters Without Bor-
ders 2021 World Press Freedom Index, which 
is the lowest position of any European Union 
country; 
Whereas on March 10, 2021, a Reporters 
Without Borders expert stated, ‘‘Press free-
dom has reached an impasse in Bulgaria and 
independent media are on the brink of dis-
appearing’’, citing political interference with 
public broadcasters, and the abuse of pri-
vately-owned media for political purposes, 
among other concerns; 
Whereas Bulgaria is an attractive, low-cost 
investment destination with a talented, 
tech-savvy labor pool, but has problems with 
endemic corruption, including in large infra-
structure projects and in the energy sector; 
Whereas on June 2, 2021, the Department of 
the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Con-
trol announced sanctions under the Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability 
Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114– 
328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note) against 3 Bulgarian 
individuals and 64 associated entities, while 
the Department of State announced visa 
bans on 5 former Bulgarian Government offi-
cials due to corruption; 
Whereas religious pluralism has long been 
a positive feature of Bulgarian society, 
though the Muslim community still encoun-
ters obstacles in its quest to reclaim prop-
erty and build new houses of worship in 
Sofia; 
Whereas the Romani community faces sys-
temic discrimination in Bulgaria, including 
discrimination in access to education, rights 
to residency, and access to voting, and 
Romani settlements faced particularly harsh 
restrictions as a result of the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas Bulgaria has withheld its support 
for neighboring North Macedonia to open ac-
cession talks with the European Union; and 
Whereas America’s most successful and en-
during relationships are built on shared val-
ues: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms its commitment to the his-
toric partnership between the United States 
and Bulgaria and to advance democracy, 
prosperity and security in Bulgaria; 
(2) congratulates the Bulgarian people on 
the successful conduct of the July 11 par-
liamentary elections; 
(3) declares its support for the Three Seas 
Initiative; 
(4) urges Bulgarian authorities to redouble 
efforts to address corruption, sustain and 
protect a healthy independent media, and 
protect the rights of all minority groups in 
Bulgaria, in line with its commitments to 
the Organization for Security and Coopera-
tion in Europe; 
(5) encourages Bulgaria to support the as-
pirations for European Union membership of 
neighboring North Macedonia; 
(6) supports Bulgaria’s efforts to diversify 
its energy sources to minimize the malign 
influence of dominant suppliers; and 
(7) affirms its intent to continue to support 
Bulgaria’s efforts in these areas, including 
through the application of a wide range of 
supportive measures, such as— 
(A) targeted Global Magnitsky Sanctions, 
as and when appropriate; and

SENATE RESOLUTION 323—RECOG-
NIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 
LANHAM ACT BY DESIGNATING 
THE MONTH OF JULY AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL 
ANTI-COUNTERFEITING 
AND CONSUMER EDUCATION AND 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. 
COONS, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. DURBIN, and Mr. 
LEAHY) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 323 
Whereas July 5, 2021, marks the 75th anni-
versary of the signing of the Act entitled 
‘‘An Act to provide for the registration and 
protection of trademarks used in commerce, 
to carry out the provisions of certain inter-
national conventions, and for other pur-
poses’’, approved July 5, 1946 (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Lanham Act’’ or the ‘‘Trade-
mark Act of 1946’’) (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) by 
President Harry S. Truman; 
Whereas the Lanham Act provided the 
foundation for modern Federal trademark 
protection, creating legal rights and rem-
edies for brand owners suffering from trade-
mark infringement, helping consumers make 
informed choices by reducing confusingly 
similar products, and making the market-
place more fair, competitive, and safe for all; 
Whereas the Lanham Act was named for 
the primary sponsor, Representative Fritz 
Lanham of Texas, who recognized a need to 
‘‘protect legitimate business and the con-
sumers of the country’’ and created a uni-
form Federal framework to protect the 
trademarks of businesses, including logos, 
words, phrases, names, packaging, scents, 
shapes, and colors; 
Whereas the Lanham Act has enabled the 
United States Patent and Trademark Office 
to administer a strong and effective Federal 
trademark registration system that helps 
trademark and brand owners safeguard their 
investments, while protecting consumers 
from confusion and deception in the market-
place and in commerce; 
Whereas the Lanham Act has been cited by 
the United States Supreme Court in more 
than 50 decisions and by Federal and State 
courts across the United States in more than 
54,000 decisions; 
Whereas, in 2019, approximately 58,200,000 
trademarks were in force around the world; 
Whereas an estimated 9,200,000 trademark 
registrations recorded worldwide in 2019 
alone, an 18.9 percent increase on the pre-
vious year’s total; 
Whereas the Lanham Act has provided 
more than 7 decades of protection for the 
consumers and industries of the United 
States, which is of growing importance given 
the explosion of counterfeiting activity asso-
ciated with the growth of both global com-
merce and electronic commerce (commonly 
referred to as ‘‘e-commerce’’); 
Whereas counterfeit products undermine 
laws, including the Lanham Act, that serve 
to safeguard consumers and brand owners 
against deceptive products in the market-
place and create profits for organized crime 
gangs at the expense of companies and gov-
ernments; 
Whereas counterfeiters use deceptive prac-
tices to entice consumers to purchase coun-
terfeit goods; 
Whereas the deceptive tactics of counter-
feiters and their counterfeit products pose 
actual and potential harm to the health and 
safety of United States citizens, especially 
the most vulnerable consumers in society, 
such as senior citizens and children; 
Whereas counterfeit products threaten the 
United States economy and job creation, 
given that intellectual property is a key 
value generator, is an enabler of success in 
competitive markets, and promotes innova-
tion and drives sustained economic growth; 
Whereas, according to a report issued on 
April 18, 2021, by the Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development, as of 
2019 the manufacturing, trade, and consump-
tion of counterfeit products is on the rise 
and trade in counterfeit products accounts 
for 3.3 percent of global trade, or approxi-
mately $500,000,000,000; 
Whereas brand owners, including corpora-
tions and medium-sized and small busi-
nesses, collectively spend billions of dollars 
annually to remove counterfeit products 
from the marketplace, including the online 
marketplace, in an effort to safeguard con-
sumers from counterfeit products and pro-
tect the innovation, reputation, and goodwill 
invested in their trademarked products and 
services; 
Whereas there is a need to support the ef-
forts of the Intellectual Property Enforce-
ment Coordinator and the National Intellec-
tual Property Rights Coordination Center to 
minimize counterfeit activity and educate 
consumers about the illegal activities that 
consumer money might support when con-
sumers knowingly or unknowingly purchase 
counterfeit products; 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion is experiencing an unprecedented vol-
ume of counterfeit products being imported 
into domestic commerce, primarily through 
the use of e-commerce and delivery in small 
packages; 
Whereas 
the 
Congressional 
Trademark 
Caucus is actively working to raise aware-
ness of the value of trademarks and the im-
pact of trademarks on the national and 
State economies, as well as the threat posed 
by counterfeit products in undermining the 
safeguards that trademark protections pro-
vide for consumers and brand owners alike; 
Whereas many governmental and non-
governmental entities, including Federal en-
forcement agencies, the National Intellec-
tual Property Rights Coordination Center, 
State enforcement agencies, and consumer 
groups, share responsibility for, and dedicate 
substantial resources towards, educating the 
people of the United States about the poten-
tial harms that can arise from counterfeit 
products in the marketplace; and 
Whereas recognition and commemoration 
of the 75th anniversary of the signing of the 
Lanham Act serves as a means of educating 
the people of the United States about the im-
portance of further raising awareness of the 
dangers counterfeit products pose to con-
sumer health and safety: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of the 
signing of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to pro-
vide for the registration and protection of 
trademarks used in commerce, to carry out 
the provisions of certain international con-
ventions, and for other purposes’’, approved 
July 5, 1946 (commonly known as the 
‘‘Lanham Act’’ or the ‘‘Trademark Act of 
1946’’) (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) by President 
Harry S. Truman; 
(2) designates the month of July 2021 as 
‘‘National Anti-Counterfeiting and Consumer 
Education and Awareness Month’’; 
(3) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Anti-Counterfeiting and Consumer 
Education and Awareness Month to educate 
the public and raise public awareness about 
the actual and potential dangers counterfeit 
products pose to consumer health and safety; 
(4) affirms the continuing importance and 
need for comprehensive Federal, State, and 
private 
sector-supported 
education 
and 
awareness efforts designed to equip the con-
sumers of the United States with the infor-
mation and tools they need to safeguard 
against illegal counterfeit products in tradi-
tional commerce, internet commerce, and 
other electronic commerce platforms; 
(5) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe and celebrate the 75th an-
niversary of the signing of the Lanham Act 
with appropriate anti-counterfeiting edu-
cation and awareness activities; and 
(6) recognizes and reaffirms the commit-
ment of the United States to combating 
counterfeiting 
by 
promoting 
awareness 
about the actual and potential harm of coun-
terfeiting to consumers and brand owners 
and by promoting new education programs 
and campaigns designed to reduce the supply 
of, and demand for, counterfeit products.

SENATE RESOLUTION 324—DESIG-
NATING JULY 30, 2021, AS ‘‘NA-

WHISTLEBLOWER 
AP-
PRECIATION DAY’’ 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. 
WYDEN, Ms. ERNST, Ms. HIRONO, Mr. 
TILLIS, Mr. PETERS, Mrs. FISCHER, Mr. 
CARPER, Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr. MARKEY, 
Ms. COLLINS, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. JOHNSON, 
Ms. BALDWIN, Mrs. BLACKBURN, Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, Mr. MORAN, Ms. SINEMA, 
Ms. HASSAN, and Mr. WARNOCK) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 324 
Whereas, in 1777, before the passage of the 
Bill of Rights, 10 sailors and Marines blew 
the whistle on fraud and misconduct that 
was harmful to the United States; 
Whereas the Founding Fathers unani-
mously supported the whistleblowers in 
words and deeds, including by releasing gov-
ernment records and providing monetary as-
sistance for the reasonable legal expenses 
necessary to prevent retaliation against the 
whistleblowers; 
Whereas, on July 30, 1778, in demonstration 
of their full support for whistleblowers, the 
members of the Continental Congress unani-
mously passed the first whistleblower legis-
lation in the United States that read: ‘‘Re-
solved, That it is the duty of all persons in 
the service of the United States, as well as 
all other the inhabitants thereof, to give the 
earliest information to Congress or other 
proper authority of any misconduct, frauds 
or misdemeanors committed by any officers 
or persons in the service of these states, 
which may come to their knowledge’’ (legis-
lation of July 30, 1778, reprinted in Journals 
of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789, ed. 
Worthington C. Ford et al. (Washington, DC, 
1904–37), 11:732); 
Whereas whistleblowers risk their careers, 
jobs, and reputations by reporting waste, 
fraud, and abuse to the proper authorities; 
Whereas, in providing the proper authori-
ties with lawful disclosures, whistleblowers 
save the taxpayers of the United States bil-
lions of dollars each year and serve the pub-
lic interest by ensuring that the United 
States remains an ethical and safe place; and 
Whereas it is the public policy of the 
United States to encourage, in accordance 
with Federal law (including the Constitution 
of the United States, rules, and regulations)

fied information (including sources and

Resolved, That the Senate—

(2) ensures that the Federal Government 
implements the intent of the Founding Fa-
thers, as reflected in the legislation passed

tion Day by—

working on behalf of the taxpayers of the 
United States, and members of the public 
about the legal right of a United States cit-

whistleblowers to combating waste, fraud,

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 2122. Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for Ms. 
STABENOW) proposed an amendment to 
the bill S. 452, to award a Congres-
sional Gold Medal to Willie O’Ree, in 
recognition of his extraordinary con-
tributions and commitment to hockey, 
inclusion, 
and 
recreational 
oppor-
tunity; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Willie O’Ree 
Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Willie O’Ree was the first Black player 
to compete in the National Hockey League 
(NHL), appearing for the Boston Bruins on 
January 18, 1958, in the throes of the civil 
rights movement in the United States help-
ing to end racial segregation in the premier 
professional ice hockey league; he is widely 
referred to as the ‘‘Jackie Robinson of Hock-
ey’’. 
(2) Willie O’Ree was born October 15, 1935, 
in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada; he 
is the youngest of 13 children and a descend-
ant of Paris O’Ree, whose name appears in 
the famous historical document ‘‘The Book 
of Negroes’’. 
(3) Willie O’Ree was raised by his parents 
in Fredericton, a predominantly White town 
where hockey was deeply rooted within the 
culture. O’Ree was a standout athlete on the 
ice and the baseball diamond. 
(4) At age 21, O’Ree was being scouted by 
professional baseball teams and seriously 
considered baseball as a career. Upon experi-
encing the segregated South for the first 
time while appearing for a minor league try-
out, his dream changed and his attention 
turned solely to ice hockey. 
(5) While playing amateur hockey, Willie 
was struck in his right eye with a puck and 
lost his eyesight. He was told by doctors to 
abandon his hockey career; instead, never 
disclosing the extent of his injury, he pur-
sued his dream of playing professional hock-
ey. 
(6) At the age of 22, O’Ree was called up 
from the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Hockey 
League (QHL) to play for the NHL’s Boston 
Bruins at a time when only 6 teams existed 
in the league. O’Ree was unaware he had bro-
ken the color barrier at the top level of the 
sport until he read it in the newspaper the 
following day. 
(7) Blind in 1 eye and a victim of racism at 
times throughout his career, O’Ree per-
severed and played professional hockey for 22 
years, tallying over 1,000 points. 
(8) In 1996, 17 years after O’Ree retired 
from 
professional 
hockey, 
the 
National 
Hockey League hired O’Ree as the first-ever 
Diversity 
Ambassador. 
Having 
already 
changed the game forever through his cour-
age and convictions, O’Ree gives new defini-
tion to what it means to be a trailblazer. 
(9) In this role as Diversity Ambassador 
with the NHL, O’Ree set out to grow the 
sport by providing access, opportunity, and 
motivation 
for 
children 
of 
all 
races, 
ethnicities, origins, and abilities. With O’Ree 
providing a vivid example of what is possible 
and serving as a relentless supporter of chil-
dren pursuing their dreams, more than 30 
nonprofit youth organizations, dubbed Hock-
ey is for Everyone programs, were developed 
across North America, each committed to of-
fering minority and underserved children an 
opportunity to play hockey, leveraging the 
sport to build character, foster positive val-
ues, and develop important life skills. 
(10) Through Hockey is for Everyone pro-
grams, more than 120,000 boys and girls have 
been positively impacted. O’Ree has devoted 
nearly 2,500 days on the ground with the 
youth participants, visiting more than 500 
schools, community centers, and rinks to 
speak to hockey’s core values and beliefs: 
stay in school; set goals for yourself; remain 
committed and disciplined; and always re-
spect your teammates, coaches, and parents. 
(11) Hockey is for Everyone programs have 
provided important opportunities for youth 
to partake in physical fitness. Today in the 
United States, fewer than half of the chil-
dren ages 6–11 engage in the recommended 
amount of physical activity, and that num-
ber is lower for low-income families. O’Ree 
has stood as a champion of youth athletic 
participation and its health benefits for dec-
ades. 
(12) Hockey is for Everyone programs pro-
vide numerous off-ice services to youth: SAT 
and academic tutoring, mentoring, nutrition 
education, college counseling, community 
service opportunities, and more. The pro-
gram has excelled at using hockey as a vehi-
cle to improve the social and emotional 
wellness of youth and improve students’ aca-
demic performances both in primary school 
and beyond. 
(13) O’Ree was also named a Member of the 
Order of Canada in 2008 and, in 2018, the City 
of Boston released an official Proclamation 
recognizing January 18, the anniversary of 
the day he broke into the game, as ‘‘Willie 
O’Ree Day’’. 
(14) In November 2018, 60 years after O’Ree 
entered the NHL, he was inducted into the 
Hockey Hall of Fame in the ‘‘builder’’ cat-
egory in recognition of his efforts to grow 
the game, using his position and the plat-
form of hockey to improve the lives of chil-
dren throughout North America. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the award, on 
behalf of the Congress, of a single gold medal

and recreational opportunity. 
(b) DESIGN

mined by the Secretary. The design shall 
bear an image of, and an inscription of the 
name of, Willie O’Ree. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary may strike 
and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold 
medal struck under section 3, at a price suf-
ficient to cover the costs of the medals, in-
cluding labor, materials, dies, use of machin-
ery, and overhead expenses. 
(b) PROCEEDS OF SALES.—The amounts re-
ceived from the sale of duplicate medals 
under subsection (a) shall be deposited in the

(c) AUTHORITY
TO USE FUND AMOUNTS.— 
There is authorized to be charged against the 
United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund 
such amounts as may be necessary to pay for 
the costs of the medals struck under this 
Act. 
SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS. 
(a) NATIONAL MEDAL.—The medals struck 
pursuant to this Act are national medals for 
purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United 
States Code. 
(b) NUMISMATIC

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5111 
July 27, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2122), in the na-
ture of a substitute, was agreed to as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Willie O’Ree 
Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Willie O’Ree was the first Black player 
to compete in the National Hockey League 
(NHL), appearing for the Boston Bruins on 
January 18, 1958, in the throes of the civil 
rights movement in the United States help-
ing to end racial segregation in the premier 
professional ice hockey league; he is widely 
referred to as the ‘‘Jackie Robinson of Hock-
ey’’. 
(2) Willie O’Ree was born October 15, 1935, 
in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada; he 
is the youngest of 13 children and a descend-
ant of Paris O’Ree, whose name appears in 
the famous historical document ‘‘The Book 
of Negroes’’. 
(3) Willie O’Ree was raised by his parents 
in Fredericton, a predominantly White town 
where hockey was deeply rooted within the 
culture. O’Ree was a standout athlete on the 
ice and the baseball diamond. 
(4) At age 21, O’Ree was being scouted by 
professional baseball teams and seriously 
considered baseball as a career. Upon experi-
encing the segregated South for the first 
time while appearing for a minor league try-
out, his dream changed and his attention 
turned solely to ice hockey. 
(5) While playing amateur hockey, Willie 
was struck in his right eye with a puck and 
lost his eyesight. He was told by doctors to 
abandon his hockey career; instead, never 
disclosing the extent of his injury, he pur-
sued his dream of playing professional hock-
ey. 
(6) At the age of 22, O’Ree was called up 
from the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Hockey 
League (QHL) to play for the NHL’s Boston 
Bruins at a time when only 6 teams existed 
in the league. O’Ree was unaware he had bro-
ken the color barrier at the top level of the 
sport until he read it in the newspaper the 
following day. 
(7) Blind in 1 eye and a victim of racism at 
times throughout his career, O’Ree per-
severed and played professional hockey for 22 
years, tallying over 1,000 points. 
(8) In 1996, 17 years after O’Ree retired 
from 
professional 
hockey, 
the 
National 
Hockey League hired O’Ree as the first-ever 
Diversity 
Ambassador. 
Having 
already 
changed the game forever through his cour-
age and convictions, O’Ree gives new defini-
tion to what it means to be a trailblazer. 
(9) In this role as Diversity Ambassador 
with the NHL, O’Ree set out to grow the 
sport by providing access, opportunity, and 
motivation 
for 
children 
of 
all 
races, 
ethnicities, origins, and abilities. With O’Ree 
providing a vivid example of what is possible 
and serving as a relentless supporter of chil-
dren pursuing their dreams, more than 30 
nonprofit youth organizations, dubbed Hock-
ey is for Everyone programs, were developed 
across North America, each committed to of-
fering minority and underserved children an 
opportunity to play hockey, leveraging the 
sport to build character, foster positive val-
ues, and develop important life skills. 
(10) Through Hockey is for Everyone pro-
grams, more than 120,000 boys and girls have 
been positively impacted. O’Ree has devoted 
nearly 2,500 days on the ground with the 
youth participants, visiting more than 500 
schools, community centers, and rinks to 
speak to hockey’s core values and beliefs: 
stay in school; set goals for yourself; remain 
committed and disciplined; and always re-
spect your teammates, coaches, and parents. 
(11) Hockey is for Everyone programs have 
provided important opportunities for youth 
to partake in physical fitness. Today in the 
United States, fewer than half of the chil-
dren ages 6–11 engage in the recommended 
amount of physical activity, and that num-
ber is lower for low-income families. O’Ree 
has stood as a champion of youth athletic 
participation and its health benefits for dec-
ades. 
(12) Hockey is for Everyone programs pro-
vide numerous off-ice services to youth: SAT 
and academic tutoring, mentoring, nutrition 
education, college counseling, community 
service opportunities, and more. The pro-
gram has excelled at using hockey as a vehi-
cle to improve the social and emotional 
wellness of youth and improve students’ aca-
demic performances both in primary school 
and beyond. 
(13) O’Ree was also named a Member of the 
Order of Canada in 2008 and, in 2018, the City 
of Boston released an official Proclamation 
recognizing January 18, the anniversary of 
the day he broke into the game, as ‘‘Willie 
O’Ree Day’’. 
(14) In November 2018, 60 years after O’Ree 
entered the NHL, he was inducted into the 
Hockey Hall of Fame in the ‘‘builder’’ cat-
egory in recognition of his efforts to grow 
the game, using his position and the plat-
form of hockey to improve the lives of chil-
dren throughout North America. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the award, on 
behalf of the Congress, of a single gold medal

tions and commitment to hockey, inclusion, 
and recreational opportunity. 
(b) DESIGN

poses of the award referred to in subsection 
(a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter

blems, devices, and inscriptions, to be deter-
mined by the Secretary. The design shall 
bear an image of, and an inscription of the 
name of, Willie O’Ree. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary may strike 
and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold 
medal struck under section 3, at a price suf-
ficient to cover the costs of the medals, in-
cluding labor, materials, dies, use of machin-
ery, and overhead expenses. 
(b) PROCEEDS OF SALES.—The amounts re-
ceived from the sale of duplicate medals 
under subsection (a) shall be deposited in the 
United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. 
(c) AUTHORITY
TO USE FUND AMOUNTS.— 
There is authorized to be charged against the 
United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund 
such amounts as may be necessary to pay for 
the costs of the medals struck under this 
Act. 
SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS. 
(a) NATIONAL MEDAL.—The medals struck 
pursuant to this Act are national medals for 
purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United 
States Code. 
(b) NUMISMATIC
ITEMS.—For purposes of 
section 5134 of title 31, United States Code, 
all medals struck under this Act shall be 
considered to be numismatic items. 
The bill (S. 452), as amended, was or-
dered to be engrossed for a third read-
ing, was read the third time, and 
passed.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me 
thank my friend for recognizing me for 
something that I consider to be and 
that he considers to be and the rest of 
the Senate considers to be very signifi-
cant. 
Our hearts are very heavy today be-
cause, like so many of my colleagues, I 
am mourning the death of my dearest 
friend, Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming. 
I say ‘‘dearest friend’’ because he is. 
Mike Enzi was the quiet leader in the 
Senate. There aren’t too many quiet 
leaders in the Senate. And when he 
talked, everyone listened, and that is a 
rare quality in a Senator. He was hum-
ble. 
Now, other than his humility, we had 
a lot in common. We were both busi-
nessmen before getting into politics, 
and we had that in common. We were 
both mayors of major cities. We had 
that in common. We were elected to 
the Senate within just about the same 
time. Just a very short time after the 
first, the second came along. So we had 
a lot in common. 
Something people might not know 
about Mike is that he had a heart for 
the downtrodden. He helped people that 
no one else helped. I mean, that is un-
usual. And the thing is, nobody knew 
that, just a handful of people who were 
with him. 
One of the places where I spent a lot 
of time with him, as a couple of other 
Members, JOHN BOOZMAN from Arkan-
sas and MIKE ROUNDS from South Da-
kota, and others—we were with him in 
some of these places where no one else 
really knew what he was doing. Some 
people might not know about Mike 
that he had a heart for the down-
trodden, to help people that no one else 
would help. 
And I spent this morning reminiscing 
with friends of mine from all over the 
world who were calling up. Most of 
them are in different time zones, and 
they found out about Mike’s death 
later on. And that put us in a position 
where we were talking to old friends 
that Mike and we had in common, and 
that happened most of the night. And 
the stories came from all over the 
world. 
I think, over the coming days and 
weeks, America is going to learn a lot 
more about Mike Enzi. The only reason 
they never knew it before was because 
he was humble, but you will see that he 
had a hidden impact on people. He had 
an impact on people that resonated for 
long periods of time, for years. He de-
served enormous credit for his lifetime 
of service but accepted none. 
We both have a heart for Africa and 
traveled there often, whether to pro-
mote our work that we were doing offi-
cially or the great partnerships, or for 
Mike to see the implementation of 
PEPFAR. 
And I say this because, if you were to 
single out one bill that helped more 
people than any other bill, likely, argu-
ably, in the U.S. Senate, it would be 
PEPFAR. You know, Mike was the 
leading architect of PEPFAR when 
AIDS was running rage across the 
globe. 
We all remember that. Everywhere 
we looked, the people were contracted 
with AIDS, especially in underserved 
places like Africa, and it was time for 
the United States to step up. President 
George W. Bush was committed to 
whatever funds it might require. 
Keep in mind that this, arguably, was 
the most significant, heartwarming 
thing that had ever happened in the 
Senate. So George W. Bush said: We 
will come with any funds that might be 
required. 
The job of the Senate was to struc-
ture the way the money was to be 
spent, but we needed someone to lead 
it. And that was what the President at 
that time said. 
Well, the majority leader at that 
time—at that time, the Republicans 
were in the majority. So we had the 
majority leader in the Senate at that 
time, who was Dr. Bill Frist of Ten-
nessee. We remember him, the fine job 
that he did. 
I remember him looking over at the 
assembled Members of our caucus and 
thinking—because he told me this 
afterwards—he was thinking: Millions 
of lives are at stake. Who do I entrust 
with this job? Millions of lives are at 
stake. Who do I entrust with this job? 
His answer was: Mike Enzi, the shoe 
salesman from Gillette. 
That bill, PEPFAR, is one of the 
greatest, most generous, most effective 
bills passed in my lifetime and the 
most significant piece of legislation 
ever for the continent of Africa. It was 
Mike Enzi’s skill, toughness, compas-
sion, and determination that got it 
done and kept it on track for a decade.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5113 
July 27, 2021 
Millions of lives have been saved. Mil-
lions of lives have been saved as a re-
sult of that one mission of Mike Enzi. 
Mike had a story he would tell about 
his approach to tough problems. I have 
heard this probably 50 times over the 
years, but I still wish I could hear it 
and hear him tell it one more time. I 
will try to do it justice. 
Mike was in South Africa. By the 
way, this thing that happened to him 
down 
there 
was 
something 
that 
changed his whole mission of prayer. 
He was with Paul. I can’t tell you what 
Paul’s last name was. Mike couldn’t 
tell us what Paul’s last name was. But 
he was a leader in South Africa. On one 
of his first visits, Mike asked Paul 
what he could do for him. Paul asked 
Mike to pray, and Mike said he would 
pray for solutions. 
The way Mike told it, Paul leapt up 
and slammed his fist on the table and 
exclaimed: No. He said: We pray for 
people, and then the issues will solve 
themselves. Pray for the people. 
See, this is what changed his whole 
prayer behavior until his death. Mike 
took that to heart and truly lived it. 
He kept the people as his focus, know-
ing that by doing so, the solutions 
would follow. Throughout his trips, he 
was always there. He was always there. 
When we couldn’t find Mike, he would 
be with the kids, with kids who had 
problems. 
In Tanzania, one of the—the first call 
I got this morning was from Lazaro. He 
is from Tanzania. He was first to ex-
press his condolences about Mike. 
Then the second call that I got—the 
first call was from the Congo. They 
started a prayer breakfast there, where 
he brought together political enemies, 
and that is still going on. So Mike had 
started a prayer breakfast in the Re-
public of the Congo, in a place where it 
is still going on today. 
Uganda—another one. He went up to 
northern Uganda. We were together at 
that time. We went with him to see the 
devastation of Joseph Kony and the 
LRA. The people in this Chamber know 
about the LRA, the Lord’s Resistance 
Army. And it was Joseph Kony. Re-
member Joseph Kony? He would be the 
guy who would go and take the kids 
out of the villages and teach them to 
shoot and kill people. I am talking 
about 10-year-old kids, 11-year-old kids. 
If they didn’t learn, they had to go 
back to their village and murder their 
parents. It was something that went on 
for a long period of time. 
This is Mike. Both of them were here 
in both of these pictures. The top one 
is that area in northern Uganda where 
all that was taking place, where Joseph 
Kony was going through these horrible 
things. 
Diana was there. Diana is with one of 
the nuns who was there at that time. 
The next picture down there—where 
is that one? That is also Uganda. Yes, 
that was also Uganda. Those little kids 
were nearing the age where they would 
be captured and sent, and he was able 
to stop that. 
Ethiopia, Yetabon. Yetabon was a 
place where we had a loved one, some-
one we really cared a lot for. She did so 
much for poor people. Yetabon was a 
place where they would go up and 
teach 
people, 
this 
very 
charitable 
group did. 
We used to call Mike the socks and 
shoes man. He was a shoe salesman. 
That is how he started out, as a shoe 
salesman. He somehow got a hold of 
more shoes and soccer balls to take to 
places in needy areas, primarily in Af-
rica. So that is where we spent time 
with him. 
Rwanda. The next picture you have— 
this has the President of Rwanda and 
his 
wife 
Jeannette, 
and 
here 
is 
Jeannette down here with his wife. It 
was something that we all loved. In 
fact, we had the wives there, four Mem-
bers of the Senate, who were there with 
us at that time. This is more of the 
things we just did together. 
In Kenya, a very similar thing hap-
pened. 
This is another thing that is taking 
place today. In Kenya, we went to the 
National Prayer Breakfast. That was 6 
or 7 years ago. We were there, and we 
had played a part in that National 
Prayer Breakfast. But at the time, 
there had been a guy named Kenyatta, 
who was President of Kenya, and 
Odinga. Odinga and Kenyatta were bit-
ter enemies, and they talked about 
killing each other. They actually tried 
several times. But Mike made a state-
ment there, with 4,000 witnesses in 
Kenya, and told a story about love and 
how these people had loved these two 
members when their Parliaments were 
together many years ago, that they 
loved each other, and invited them to 
come up and to embrace, and they did 
that. That was between two groups of 
people headed up by Kenyatta and 
Odinga, and they became, right at that 
point, friends for life. Today, they are 
still friends. Kenyatta is retiring, and 
Odinga most likely will be elected to 
be his successor. Now, that was years 
ago when that happened. 
Western Sahara. Right now, we are 
fighting this thing. We are very much 
on the side of the Western Sahara in 
the fight. 
The picture you are looking at, I 
think, is a picture of President Ghali. 
President Ghali, yes. Wherever we 
went, we would also see—Mike would 
disappear. These are the only two he 
could find in that area who were from 
his State. But nonetheless, there he is 
with the leader, the President of that 
country. 
John Kufuor—the same thing hap-
pened. John Kufuor—it is kind of funny 
because if you go to Ghana—and not to 
be 
confused 
with 
Uganda—but 
in 
Ghana, it is funny because there are 
more people there, more Jesus people 
there than anywhere else. So he named 
a stand—to help some people there, he 
called it Jesus for Jesus. That was 
Mike Enzi. 
Malawi. He started a prayer group in 
Malawi. The young parliamentarians 
on this early visit—Lazarus was one of 
the original members and is now Presi-
dent of Malawi. Now, we are getting a 
bit old now, but this happened a long 
time ago. He was close with him, and 
that is another call that we got early 
this morning. 
There are probably half a dozen other 
countries in Africa we visited together 
and a dozen or so outside of the con-
tinent. No matter how difficult the trip 
was, whether he was getting left in 
Kosovo, which actually happened—he 
was with a bunch of kids in Kosovo, 
and we miscounted our passengers and 
left him in Kosovo and had to go back 
and get him. But no matter how dif-
ficult the trip was by the codel, leading 
to a new term called ‘‘getting Enzi’d’’— 
so that is a new term that we use here 
in the U.S. Senate. If you are late 
someplace and you get left alone, you 
are ‘‘getting Enzi’d’’; or in Uganda 
when the ceiling in his hotel room fell 
on him when he was sleeping. He was 
always there no matter how tough 
things were. 
It was more than the policy for Mike; 
he also loved people—I mean all people. 
We couldn’t go anywhere without him 
packing hundreds of soccer balls and 
shoes to give away to kids. 
Now, how it happened, soccer balls 
and shoes—I don’t know how many 
thousands of soccer balls and shoes 
that he had distributed to these kids, 
but one thing they all had in common: 
They were all barefoot when they 
started. 
One of the things that we attributed 
to him because it was one of his favor-
ite proverbs, Proverbs 31:8–9—this actu-
ally is not by Solomon; this is by some-
one a lot of people haven’t heard of. It 
was King Lemuel. ‘‘Speak up for those 
who cannot speak for themselves, for 
the rights of all who are destitute. 
Speak up and judge fairly; defend the 
rights of the poor and needy.’’ That 
was the impact that Mike had on ev-
eryone. 
He and Diana also regularly hosted 
parties for Capitol staff. This is kind of 
interesting because we are used to par-
ties around here. There are lots of par-
ties to go to. Every night, there are 
parties and all that, but not Mike’s 
parties. Mike’s parties were for the 
people, for the staff. They were for the 
people you didn’t see every day. You 
would see them every day, but you 
would never give appreciation to them: 
the cleaning staff, food service, elec-
tricians, and others. These are the peo-
ple he invited, and he and his wife 
would do together, would hold these 
parties for them. Diana enjoyed it just 
as much as Mike did. He loved those 
parties. 
He also loved talking about how, dur-
ing one of them, he was talking to an 
electrician in the Capitol, some guy 
who was working as an electrician in 
the Capitol, who kept the place going 
every day—we understand that—and 
then the man turned to him after they 
had talked for a long period of time. 
Mike had asked him what an elec-
trician does around the Capitol and all

that. When he got all through, he 
looked at Mike and said: Well, Mike, 
what do you do? So that was Mike. He 
never wanted attention from anyone. 
He always laughed about that story. 
That was good. 
Now, we are talking today about how 
much of a team Mike and Diana were 
and how well they complemented each 
other. She was saying how much fun 
they were to be with because they 
truly enjoyed everything that they did. 
As Kay put it—my wife—she said: They 
both looked for ways to help people. 
While Mike was steadfast and inten-
tional, Diana was a whirlwind of en-
ergy that brought the vision to life. 
You know, Kay and Mike were also 
both members of the Zipper Club—I bet 
you guys don’t know what the Zipper 
Club was—because they both had their 
heart valves replaced about the same 
time. My wife used a cow valve, and 
Mike used a mechanical valve. Diana 
would always tell Kay that she could 
hear Mike’s valve rattling at night. So 
Kay always told him that he should 
have had it done with a cow valve. 
You know, these are very important 
subjects we are talking about here. But 
they are things that make memories. 
That is really who he is and who he 
was. 
Mike never missed our weekly Sen-
ate Prayer Breakfasts, where he was a 
leader for many years. He even had a 
card with all 100 Senators—that is all 
the Senators who are here in this room 
right now—all 100 Senators, and he di-
vided 100 Senators up into 5 groups. So 
he would pray for 20 Senators each day. 
One time when he was leading the 
Prayer Breakfast, he invited King 
Abdullah from Jordan to join us. In 
fact, King Abdullah was here last week, 
and I shared this story with him be-
cause he was always a little nervous 
about what he was going to say. The 
Lord gave him a verse, and it was an 
excellent example of prayer uniting 
those different faiths. We are talking 
about the Muslims and Mike Enzi. So 
King Abdullah paid homage to him, 
saying he should have been there 
again. 
Even after he retired from the Sen-
ate, he joined us every week and vir-
tually for prayer and discussion and 
fellowship. Tomorrow’s breakfast will 
not be the same because he retired 
from the Senate just a few months ago, 
but he attended every one of our Pray-
er Breakfasts virtually. So, as MIKE 
ROUNDS said, I got to know Mike on a 
deeper level each week. But more than 
anything else, bigger than any other 
accomplishment, was Mike’s love for 
his family. 
Mike was utterly devoted to his fam-
ily for more than 50 years: Diana; the 
three children, Amy, Emily, and Brad; 
and their grandchildren. Come to think 
of it, Mike’s favorite topics were Jesus, 
the family, and fishing. 
Now, you might think that trout 
fishing wouldn’t be anyone’s favorite 
thing to do if they are a Member of the 
Senate. But he would travel around. 
There is not a lot of people but a lot of 
land in Wyoming. One of the problems 
he would have, his staff would tell me, 
was that they would line up something 
he was supposed to be doing in another 
part of the State, but he would go 
across the creek someplace, and he 
would get out and, if he was catching 
fish, he would completely forget about 
where he was going to go. And the 
staffs don’t enjoy that type of thing. 
Nonetheless, that is what he did. He 
knew how to fly-fish. In fact, one of the 
things we were anticipating from Mike 
and Diana was that Kay and I spent a 
lot of time—people don’t realize that in 
the State of Oklahoma we have more 
miles of freshwater shoreline than in 
any of the 50 States. Do you believe 
that? Yes, it is true. Nonetheless, he 
loved to fish. 
One of the things they were going to 
do when they retired, Mike and Diana, 
was that they were planning to travel 
Route 66 and go all the way across. 
Well, the cabin we have in Lake 
Texoma, OK, is right on Route 66. So 
they were planning to come and join 
us. 
Kay and I join the entire Enzi family 
together in their grief and in cele-
brating the remarkable life of a true 
servant leader, Mike Enzi. And all we 
say is: Mike, we will see you soon. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF MR. VERN OLLAR OF 
KERRVILLE, TEXAS 
HON. CHIP ROY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the 100th birthday of Mr. Vern Ollar 
of Kerrville, Texas. Corporal Ollar served with 
Company B of the 81st Chemical Mortar Bat-
talion, United States Army, in World War II. 
His unit was commended with a Presidential 
Unit Citation for their heroic landing on D-Day 
at the Dog Green sector of Omaha Beach. 
They supported the Army Rangers at Pointe 
Du Hoc, and then went on to beat the Nazis 
on the other side of Paris. He was in the first 
unit to enter Germany under the 4th Armored 
Division. 
After victory in Europe was declared, Cor-
poral Ollar taught Belgian civilians how to de-
tect enemy mortar locations. When World War 
II came to an end, Corporal Ollar finally head-
ed back home to the United States of America 
where he and his wife Jayne raised four chil-
dren. Mr. Ollar gained experience in the pri-
vate sector and eventually started his own 
business, Ollar Hardware Company Incor-
porated. He retired in 1985 and sold the busi-
ness to his children. 
Mr. Ollar lost his dear wife Jayne after 55 
years of marriage in 1997. He later married 
again to Diane, and together they are blessed 
with six children. The French Government 
awarded Mr. Ollar with their Legion of Honor 
in 2014 as a token of thanks for his role in lib-
erating their country. 
Like many of his fellow World War II vet-
erans, Mr. Ollar found it difficult to speak 
about his war-time experiences. However, that 
changed when he traveled to Normandy for 
the 70th anniversary of his landing there. Mr. 
Ollar was touched by the fact that civilian 
homes sit safe and sound on the very same 
hill that his unit climbed on June 6, 1944. This 
anniversary trip helped Mr. Ollar speak about 
his World War II experiences for the first time. 
He and Diane both fought a very different 
battle this past year and were victorious 
against their enemy, the COVID–19 virus. It is 
a privilege and honor to rise today in honor of 
a true American hero, Mr. Vern Ollar, in rec-
ognition of his 100th birthday.

HONORING DR. BARBARA FERRER 
AS A 28TH CONGRESSIONAL DIS-
TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Woman’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Dr. Barbara 
Ferrer of the Echo Park neighborhood of Los 
Angeles, California. 
Dr. Ferrer obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 
Community Studies from the University of 
California, Santa Cruz, a Master of Arts in 
Public Health from Boston University, a Master 
of Arts in Education from the University of 
Massachusetts, Boston, and a Ph.D. in Social 
Welfare from Brandeis University. A renowned 
and respected public health leader, Dr. Ferrer 
has more than four decades of professional 
experience as a researcher, philanthropic 
strategist, community advocate, educational 
leader, and public health director. 
Dr. Ferrer has held several leadership posi-
tions throughout the years, serving as Director 
of Health Promotion & Chronic Disease Pre-
vention and Director of the Division of Mater-
nal & Child Health, respectively, at the Massa-
chusetts Department of Public Health. She 
also served as Headmaster at a high school in 
Boston, where she spearheaded efforts to im-
prove high school graduation rates. After 
working in these capacities, Dr. Ferrer served 
as the Executive Director of the Boston Public 
Health Commission. In this role, she directed 
the city’s health department, including man-
aging 1,100 employees, oversaw all Commis-
sion programs, and was a senior member of 
the Mayor’s cabinet, advising on health-related 
issues. Under her leadership, the City of Bos-
ton experienced improvements in health out-
comes, such as a decrease in the rates of 
childhood obesity, infant mortality, and smok-
ing. Dr. Ferrer then went on to work for the 
W.K. Kellogg Foundation in Michigan as the 
Chief Strategy Officer, where her responsibil-
ities included developing the strategic direction 
and providing leadership to the foundation’s 
key program areas, such as community en-
gagement, racial equity, and family economic 
security. 
Presently, Dr. Barbara Ferrer serves as Di-
rector of the Los Angeles County Department 
of Public Health, which prevents disease, pro-
tects health, and promotes well-being and eq-
uity in Los Angeles County. In this capacity, 
she oversees a workforce of nearly 7,000 
staff, and oversees all operating units, includ-
ing the Bureaus of Operations Support, Health 
Promotion, Health Protection, and Disease 
Control. 
Dr. 
Ferrer 
guided 
the 
area’s 
coronavirus pandemic response, collaborating 
with the County and community-based part-
ners to ensure targeted services and appro-
priate policies to keep Los Angeles County 
residents safe during this health crisis. She 
leads the Department’s Incident Command 
System, incepted at the start of the pandemic 
to facilitate informed decision-making and im-
plementation of mitigation and response activi-
ties, such as safety protocols. The crisis re-
sponse has included communications with 
education sectors, residents, and businesses, 
disease and outbreak management, vaccine 
planning and administration, development and 
implementation of health officer orders, and 
engagement of community leaders and stake-
holders in response efforts. Dr. Ferrer’s unpar-
alleled and compassionate leadership, coupled 
with her wealth of knowledge, helped the com-
munity navigate during these unprecedented 
times. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Dr. Barbara Ferrer.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
HON-
ORARY FIREFIGHTER PENELOPE 
SALTRAY 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Miss Penelope ‘Penny’ Saltray 
as she is named an Honorary Firefighter for 
the Hanford and Kings County Fire Depart-
ments. 
Penny Saltray, a seven-year-old citizen of 
the City of Hanford, California, dreams of one 
day becoming a firefighter. She currently bat-
tles the life-altering symptoms of a diagnosis 
no other person in the world shares. Despite 
her conditions and the daily obstacles she 
must overcome, Miss Saltray maintains re-
markable desire, excitement, and curiosity 
about a career as a firefighter. 
Firefighters put their lives in danger to help 
others. They exhibit incredible courage, drive, 
and character while serving their community. 
Much like a firefighter, Miss Saltray battles 
dangerous threats every day with inspiring 
strength and determination. She truly has the 
heart of a firefighter. 
Miss Saltray’s resilience, passion, and posi-
tive attitude perfectly represents the spirit of 
Hanford and what it means to be a firefighter. 
By being sworn in as an honorary firefighter 
for the Hanford and Kings County Fire Depart-
ment, Miss Penny Saltray has rightly achieved 
her dream. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Honorary Firefighter Miss Penny Saltray 
for her strength and ambition to serve.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today

ant J.G. Howard T. Oedel. It is with great

my great honor to serve those who have 
served us. 
I wish Howard the happiest of birthdays. 
Congratulations.

HONORING SUSAN SUNG HEE LEE 
AS A 28TH CONGRESSIONAL DIS-
TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Susan Sung 
Hee Lee of La Crescenta, California. 
A native Angeleno, Susan has lived in La 
Crescenta for most of her life, and attended 
Monte Vista Elementary School, Rosemont 
Middle School, and Crescenta Valley High 
School. She served in her church for many 
years, teaching Bible study to youth, and went 
on several mission trips to serve in rural cities 
in Mexico and northern Thailand. After grad-
uating from high school, Susan pursued higher 
education receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree 
in Humanities with an Asian American Studies 
major from the University of California, Irvine, 
an Associate’s Degree in Nursing from Glen-
dale Community College, and a Bachelor of 
Science in Nursing from Azusa Pacific Univer-
sity. 
Susan’s mother, who has been a nurse for 
more than four decades, inspired, supported, 
and encouraged Susan’s pursuit in becoming 
a nurse. Currently, Ms. Lee is a registered 
nurse at USC Verdugo Hills Hospital in the in-
tensive care unit, where she has been a Relief 
Charge Nurse for nearly eleven years. She 
highly values her work as a nurse and strives 
to care for every patient as if they were a 
member of her family. As a La Crescenta resi-
dent for many years, Susan feels fortunate to 
be taking care of members of her community 
and serving in the area where she grew up. 
Susan’s dedication and passion for her job 
became even more evident during the unprec-
edented coronavirus pandemic. With the 
wholehearted support of her family, Ms. Lee 
worked at least one overtime shift every week 
and would stay past her 12-hour shifts when 
there was a shortage of nurses. Further, she 
volunteered to come to work before the start 
of her shifts so there would not be a gap in 
the care the patients were receiving. Susan 
also credits her work colleagues, who she 
sees as a second family, for persevering dur-
ing the pandemic. 
During the pandemic, Susan used her sew-
ing machine to sew her own scrub caps and 
provided scrub caps to each of her col-
leagues, as well as putting her years of 
haircutting experience from her mission trips 
to use by giving haircuts to her colleagues 
when the hair salons and barber shops were 
closed. In addition, she brought homemade 
baked goods to share with her colleagues and 
continues to do so until today. While Susan 
sees these as simple gestures, she takes 
pride in knowing that she can provide comfort 
in the trying times of the pandemic and hopes 
to be able to contribute in this way throughout 
her career and personal life. 
Susan is a loving wife and mother of two 
young children. She thrives in the outdoors 
and enjoys camping, hiking, scuba diving and 
bike riding. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Susan Sung Hee Lee.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GEORGE 
PRATT HOWARD 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to ask the Members of the House to join 
me in mourning the passing of one of our Na-
tion’s foremost experts on aviation safety and 
infrastructure, George ‘‘Pratt’’ Howard of Deep 
River, Connecticut. Known as Peter to family 
and friends—he passed away at his home in 
Deep River on January 30, 2021. Peter has 
moved on from this world but his spirit of love 
for his neighbors and community will never 
dissipate, and will continue to inspire us to put 
the public good above personal ambition or 
gain, and always treat one another with com-
passion and care. 
Born in New York City’s Greenwich Vil-
lage—Peter spent most of his childhood in the 
city and absorbed the cultural and community 
diversity in the big apple that would positively 
influence his creative and artistic mind later in 
life. An avid student and passionate learner— 
Peter left the city after high school to earn a

degree in economics from the University of 
Virginia before returning to the city to acquire 
a master’s in business administration from 
New York University. Following university, 
Peter decided to pursue a career in a field that 
he had a true passion for—aviation. With that, 
Peter joined the Air Force where he gained 
firsthand knowledge of aviation as he worked 
with some of the most advanced military grade 
technology to exist in that time from 1952 to 
1955. After receiving significant experience in 
the ins and outs of aviation in the Air Force, 
Peter began a life-long journey in the civilian 
aviation space serving in leadership positions 
in several organizations including Director of 
Marketing for Eastern Airlines, and Chief of 
Economics/Asst. Director for Policy and Exter-
nal affairs for the port authorities of both New 
York and New Jersey. 
In 1989, Peter landed a job that would allow 
him to have a direct impact on aviation policy 
in our nation—he became the new executive 
director of the Airport Operators Council Inter-
national. In this role, he worked tirelessly in 
his 
advocacy 
of 
policy 
and 
procedural 
changes to improve the safety and effective-
ness of American airports. His expertise was 
highly valued by all his colleagues and was 
often sought-after by policy makers. Proof of 
this can be seen in countless news media 
interviews and multiple testimonies he gave in 
Congressional hearings. In his work with Con-
gress, he played a critical role in the Aviation 
Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990. 
Since passage, this legislation has raised over 
$60 billion for airports in supporting passenger 
safety. Peter’s work with aviation policy was 
truly light years ahead of his time as he under-
stood that with increased air traffic and 
globalization—safety would need to become a 
number one priority for American airline com-
panies and our domestic security apparatus. 
Peter was steadfast in his commitment to our 
nation’s aviation industry and his efforts have 
inspired others to continue the mission of en-
suring that our air travel procedure always 
meet the most comprehensive safety stand-
ards. 
Outside of the field of aviation, Peter was 
also an accomplished art historian who always 
used his wealth of knowledge to educate and 
enlighten anyone who was interested in the 
field. This included municipal governments 
and non-profit organizations in New York and 
Connecticut who used Peter’s insights to ex-
pand their community arts and historical pres-
ervation programs. As a New York Resident, 
Peter was always active in his community and 
even became President of the Brooklyn Heigh 
association from 1967 to 1969. As President— 
Peter was one of the driving forces in the pas-
sage of New York’s landmark law which re-
sulted in Brooklyn Heights becoming the first 
designated Historic district in New York City. 
Later in life—Peter moved to Deep River 
and officially became a resident of Con-
necticut. As a Deep River resident, Peter tire-
lessly contributed to this historic Connecticut 
river town whose rich history and high quality 
of life he passionately championed. He offered 
his public policy expertise as an adviser to the 
Board of Selectman, and the town greatly ben-
efitted from his creative solutions to complex 
problems, without incurring the high cost of 
consultants. I also recall Peter’s tremendous 
efforts in establishing the town’s first Design 
Advisory Board for which he became its first 
chairman. In this role, he organized and exe-
cuted art galleries for the town that displayed 
local artwork, including artwork from students 
at the local high school. He would also work 
together with the rest of the board to review 
and critique ideas for development in the town 
put together by the Planning & Zoning Com-
mission. What Peter did for art and historical 
preservation in every community he lived in is 
truly remarkable. 
Madam Speaker, it was an honor to rep-
resent a constituent as caring and compas-
sionate for his community and Nation as 
Peter, who’s dedication to our community and 
the town of Deep River went far beyond his 
service in local government. As a longtime 
friend and supporter of my work as a con-
gressman, I always enjoyed talking to Peter 
and picking his brain on experiences he had 
with the U.S. Congress in the past and his 
well-informed opinions on current events, both 
at home and abroad. Even in his free time, he 
went the extra mile to enhance the commu-
nity, from personally landscaping at the Vet-
eran’s Garden to helping design the local town 
pharmacy. Although his memory will live on 
through countless others, including his wife of 
50 years, Sukey Howard, his three daughters, 
Connie, Kitty, and Ginger, his four grand-
children, and one great grandson, our eastern 
Connecticut community owes him an immeas-
urable level of gratitude. To that end, I ask 
that my colleagues and this Chamber join me 
in expressing our deepest condolences to the 
Howard Family and setting Peter Howard’s 
name further into stone.

SHAWN HAUSE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Shawn Hause 
for his longstanding and esteemed career in 
law enforcement and service to our country. 
At the age of 19, Shawn knew he wanted to 
serve in law enforcement and joined the 
Washington State Patrol Explorers in the Spo-
kane District 4 Detachment and learned the 
ways of Washington State Patrol for two years 
until aging out of the program. At the age of 
23, he was accepted into the Spokane County 
Reserve Deputy program where he volun-
teered a minimum of 16 hours a month in pa-
trol work as a deputy sheriff. During this time, 
Shawn also was hired by the Colfax Police 
Department in Colfax, Wash. as a part-time of-
ficer. Shawn was credited with making the 
largest drug bust of any Colfax officer at that 
time after stopping a vehicle and seizing over 
one pound of marijuana in route to the Wash-
ington State University campus. 
Two years later, Shawn was hired by the 
Spokane County Sheriff’s office as a full-time 
deputy sheriff. He attended the Spokane Po-
lice Academy and graduated at the top of his 
class in firearms proficiency. He went on to 
work graveyard, swing shift, power shift and 
dayshift patrol. He volunteered to be a fire-
arms instructor where he instructed new re-
cruits and his peers for six years. He was then 
accepted into the Spokane County SWAT 
(Special Weapons and Tactics) Team. He 
graduated from the Hanford SWAT Basic 
School in Richland, Wash. and served with the 
SWAT team for approximately nine months. 
After working as a patrol deputy for about 
seven years, successfully making numerous 
arrests for various drug violations, Shawn was 
accepted to Spokane County’s drug unit, 
known as the Investigative Support Unit. In 
that role, he worked low to mid-level drug 
crimes within the Spokane County area. He 
worked in that position for four and a half 
years until the position was defunded at which 
time, he returned to patrol work. Following six 
months of patrol, Shawn was accepted as part 
of the Spokane Regional Drug Task Force 
(SRDTF). 
In the SRDTF, Shawn worked closely with 
the Drug Enforcement Agency, U.S. Attorney’s 
Office and other state and local agencies to 
identify, infiltrate, and dismantle highlevel drug 
traffickers and Drug Trafficking Organizations 
in the Eastern District of Washington. During 
this time, Shawn and his best friend and part-
ner (a uniformed deputy) were involved in an 
officer-involved shooting by a suspect the 
SRDTF was investigating. Shawn also worked 
in an undercover capacity, buying large quan-
tities of methamphetamine from different fac-
tions of the Sinaloa Drug Cartel. Shawn also 
assisted other agents/officers with a large 
scale, multi-state Oxycodone investigation that 
involved the Eight-Trey gang out of California 
in which the SRDTF and DEA were nationally 
recognized for their work. Shawn also worked 
with the FBI’s Gang Enforcement Task Force 
where he worked to specifically target drug 
cartels and gang members that were commit-
ting drug crimes. While working with the FBI, 
Shawn held a TopSecret security clearance. 
As a five-year rotated position, Shawn was ro-
tated out of his drug investigator role after 
being granted an extra year based on his un-
dercover work that was ongoing in the U.S. 
and Mexico. 
In total, Shawn spent more than 10 years 
working drug crimes and finished his career as 
a uniformed patrol deputy. He medically re-
tired in good standing in 2019. I want to ex-
tend my deepest appreciation for Shawn 
Hause’s service to the State of Washington, 
the surrounding region, and our country.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
UNITED 
WAY 
OF 
PIERCE COUNTY 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take this moment to commemorate the 
100th Anniversary of United Way of Pierce 
County. 
United Way of Pierce County has been an 
integral part of our community since its found-
ing on May 14, 1921—100 years ago. Estab-
lished by an organizing committee composed 
of nine women and led by Emily R. Seymour, 
the organization was originally known as the 
Federation of Social Service Agencies. Found-
ed to coordinate work among multiple Tacoma 
social agencies and serve more people, this 
organization has gone forward to provide serv-
ices and leadership to our community for a 
century. 
Over the last hundred years, United Way of 
Pierce County’s mission has remained fo-
cused on breaking the cycle of poverty for 
local families. Since its founding, this organi-
zation has raised and reinvested 350 million 
dollars in our community. 
United Way of Pierce County is also a lead-
er in supporting diversity and inclusion efforts 
in our region. Their commitment to confronting 
systemic racism and recognizing its role in 
perpetrating persistent socioeconomic dispari-
ties strengthens their impact as they work for 
the prosperity and dignity of every person in 
the community. 
Their current goal is to lift 15,000 house-
holds out of poverty and into financial stability 
by 2028. I look forward to working with United 
Way of Pierce County in continued partnership 
to address poverty and care for our commu-
nity. They are difference makers. 
I’d like to congratulate the organization’s tre-
mendous leadership, including President & 
CEO Dona Ponepinto, the board, and every 
person in our community that has supported 
their extraordinary work. 
Madam Speaker, Members of Congress, 
please join me in celebrating the 100th Anni-
versary of United Way of Pierce County.

HONORING 
LYNN 
LEMAY 
AS 
A 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Lynn LeMay 
of West Hollywood, California. 
Lynn has been a resident of West Holly-
wood for many years. Her mother was in the 
United States Army and her father, who 
served in World War II, was a First Lieutenant 
in the U.S. Marine Corps. Lynn was born in 
San Diego, California, while her father was 
overseas. 
For many years, Ms. LeMay was a profes-
sional event planner and fundraiser for non- 
profit, corporate, and political groups. She 
oversaw numerous events for thousands of 
guests. Currently retired, Lynn dedicates her 
time to serve the LGBTQ community, and has 
done so for more than forty years. She is a 
steadfast advocate for people living with AIDS. 
Her compassion for people living with AIDS 
began in the 1980’s when she worked in the 
interior design industry with renowned de-
signer, Barbara Lockhart. 
During her extensive nonprofit career, Ms. 
LeMay worked for Gay and Lesbian Adoles-
cent Social Services, and while working for the 
AIDS Healthcare Foundation, helped open 
three hospice sites for individuals with AIDS. 
In addition, she volunteered with AIDS Project 
Los Angeles and with a Master’s degree in 
clinical psychology, was a compassionate re-
source for those in need. 
Lynn has been a volunteer with Project 
Angel Food for many years, which serves 
medically tailored meals to individuals living 
with illnesses, including HIV/AIDS. She was 
one of the first volunteers when founder 
Marianne Williamson was initially setting up 
the organization. Ms. LeMay serves as one of 
Project Angel Food’s Telephone Angels, which 
is a buddy telephone program designed to 
combat social isolation. She also played a role 
in implementing Project Angel Food’s Femi-
nine Hygiene Program, which conducts out-
reach to age-appropriate clients. Lynn took 
part in both programs during the coronavirus 
pandemic. She felt fulfilled speaking to individ-
uals on the phone to let them know that they 
were being thought of and there was someone 
to listen to them. 
Lynn has a son, Austin, who has followed in 
his mother’s footsteps by being an AIDS activ-
ist while he was enrolled at the University of 
California, Santa Cruz. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Lynn LeMay.

HONORING 102 YEAR-OLD WWII 
VET GEORGE BUHLER 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. George Buhler of Berne, 
Indiana. 
Our Nation owes George a tremendous debt 
of gratitude for his dedicated service to our 
country in the United States Army during 
World War II. Serving in a military police unit 
in the European Theatre, his sacrifices were 
critical to the defense of our homeland and to 
the security and prosperity for millions of peo-
ple. 
As a sergeant in the 8th Infantry Division, 
George landed in Normandy, France, just 
days after the initial Allied invasion in June 
1944. In July, George’s platoon moved for-
ward into Germany. There, he encountered 
General George S. Patton who ordered 
George to help procure the equipment and 
maps necessary for American troops to ad-
vance over the Siegfried Line. The Allied ad-
vance into Germany continued into autumn 
and winter, during which George’s unit fought 
in the Battle of Hu¨rtgen Forest and the Battle 
of the Bulge. In 1945, George returned to 
France, wherein he saw the end of the war in 
Europe. 
George returned to civilian life and, like 
most in the Greatest Generation, was modest 
in recalling his service in the years thence-
forth. That’s why I’m proud to honor George, 
the oldest veteran in Adams County, by enter-
ing into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD these re-
gards. George, on behalf of Congress, let me 
say: we hope your heart is filled with joy in 
knowing you have experienced our country’s 
greatest blessings, including the affection of 
family, friends, and a grateful nation, over a 
long and well-lived life. 
George’s legacy of service is a proud part of 
the American story. This is a testament to his 
commitment to our people, and the ideals, to 
which we strive.

RECOGNIZING JULIE PARKER AS 
MY 
CONSTITUENTS 
OF 
THE 
MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great honor to recognize one of my dis-
trict’s finest educators, Principal Julie Parker, 
as my July Constituent of the Month. After 
spending 34 years molding young minds and 
building a foundation for her students’ suc-
cess, Principal Julie Parker’s journey came to 
a close with her well-deserved retirement. For 
the last 26 years, Julie was a source of lead-
ership and inspiration for students, parents, 
and staff alike at the Cardiff School. 
As a father of two young children, I know 
from experience how valuable and cherished 
our educators are to our communities, and 
Principal Parker’s passion for teaching and 
creating a thriving environment for youth is an 
inspiration. Seeking to ensure that her stu-
dents have every opportunity to grow and 
flourish, Principal Parker played a significant 
role in the recent remodeling of the Cardiff 
School, which brought about critical improve-
ments for students to embrace their gifts in the 
award-winning institution. She also guided the 
school through the creation of several suc-
cessful programs that create well-rounded stu-
dents, including Garden to Lunch, Cardio 
Club, and STEAM Lab. Under her devoted 
leadership, the school continues to strive for 
and achieve academic excellence. 
Through a year of uncertainty and chal-
lenges posed by the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Principal Parker went above and beyond to 
keep the fabric of her school’s community 
strong. When the school moved to a virtual 
learning format at the onset of the pandemic, 
she took it upon herself to hand-deliver per-
sonalized gifts to each of her teachers at their

homes. When her school resumed in-person 
learning months later, Principal Parker was the

leader through these trying times. 
For her mentorship, kindness, and commit-
ment to excellence, Principal Parker will be 
thoroughly missed in the education commu-
nity, and I’m incredibly thankful for her passion 
to uplift and encourage our youth. I’m proud to 
honor her as my July Constituent of the

RICK SHANKLIN 
HON. JAMES COMER 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Rick Shanklin on his retirement from 
the National Weather Service at the end of 
this month. His impressive thirty-seven-year 
career has spanned across multiple states and 
saved countless lives from natural disasters. 
Rick has accomplished many unique feats 
during his career. He is the only meteorologist 
to serve in all three NWS offices in Kentucky, 
as well as pioneering the Kentucky Mesonet. 
He also is a national expert for rating torna-
does EF3 or stronger and surveyed six EF4 
tornadoes. 
Rick helped NWS Paducah earn Gold, Sil-
ver, and Bronze medals from the Department 
of Commerce. Both the Governors of Ken-
tucky and Missouri have recognized him for 
his expertise as well. 
I want to thank Rick Shanklin for his service 
to the First District of Kentucky and the United 
States over his career. It is an honor to rep-
resent him in Congress and I wish him a 
happy retirement.

IN HONOR OF ANDREW SHORT 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Colonel Andrew 
‘‘Coby’’ Short for his dedicated service to our 
country upon his retirement from the U.S. 
Army. 
As Commander for the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers in the Pittsburgh District since July 
of 2018, Colonel Short has served for three 
years to improve the region’s critical infrastruc-
ture. In addition to his service to the Pittsburgh 
District, Colonel Short was also appointed as 
the Border District Commander and tasked 
with directing a project that would focus on the 
construction of the U.S. Government’s south-
western border. 
Since he began his military career with a 
commission as a Second Lieutenant upon 
graduation from the U.S. Military Academy in 
1997, Colonel Short has received numerous 
awards for his service, including the Bronze 
Star, the Combat Action Badge, and the 
Bronze Order of the De Fleury Medal, an 
award of the of the U.S. Army Engineer Asso-
ciation. 
Colonel Short served the citizens of Penn-
sylvania’s 13th Congressional District as a 
member of our Military Service Academy Inter-
view Board, where he vetted potential nomi-
nees to our nation’s service academies. I am 
grateful for his work in this capacity to ensure 
the continued readiness of our nation’s Armed 
Forces for years to come. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I thank Colonel Short for his 
service, and I wish him continued success as 
he enters retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF PHYLLIS 
GOULD 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise along 
with my colleague, JARED HUFFMAN, to honor 
the late Phyllis Gould, one of the Bay Area 
Rosie the Riveters whose work was essential 
for the United States and its allies to win the 
war. Phyllis passed away on July 20, 2021, 
just shy of her 100th birthday on October 7. 
We had the honor and pleasure to work with 
Phyllis on legislation that recognizes the im-
mense contributions the Rosies have made to 
history. 
Phyllis Mickey Gould was born at Camp 
Lewis, now Fort Lewis, Washington. Her father 
served in the Army for 30 years and received 
a Silver Star and Purple Heart for his service 
in France during the World War I. Back during 
that time, Phyllis liked to explain, women didn’t 
plan a career at an early age, instead they 
learned to cook and sew and were expected 
to marry young and raise a family. World War 
II changed that. Men were drafted to fight the 
war, leaving the jobs building ships, planes 
and munitions vacant. More than ten million 
women nationwide stepped in. In July 1942, 
Phyllis became one of the first six women 
welders at Kaiser shipyards in Richmond, Cali-
fornia. Soon she was followed by her two sis-
ters who became a draftsman and a welder 
and by her mother who became a painter. The 
Richmond shipyard built a record 747 cargo 
ships. Phyllis worked as a welder until the end 
of the war. 
The Rosies were iconized by a poster by 
Howard Miller which ironically didn’t become 
famous until 40 years after its creation. It’s a 
poster of a young woman with a polka dot 
bandana, rolling up her denim shirt sleeve, 
flexing her bicep and exclaiming ‘‘We Can Do 
It!’’ Miller was hired by Westinghouse Com-
pany’s War Production Coordinating Com-
mittee in 1942 to create a series of posters of 
inspirational images to boost worker morale. It 
was displayed only to Westinghouse employ-
ees in the Midwest for two weeks in 1943 and 
then disappeared. In the 1980s it was redis-
covered, labeled Rosie the Riveter and be-
came a symbol for American feminism. 
For Phyllis, the Rosies never received the 
recognition they deserved, so she made it her 
life’s mission to change that and this is how 
my colleagues and I came to know her. She 
was laser focused, feisty and tenacious. She 
emphatically stated, ‘‘The military could not 
have done what it did without what we did! 
Every item they needed to succeed—a woman 
helped produce!!’’ Her ultimate dream was to 
have a National Rosie Holiday, a plaque at 
veterans memorials across the country, a stat-
ue on the Washington Mall, an annual special 
commemorative coin, and a ticker tape parade 
down 5th Avenue in New York. You see, Phyl-
lis always aimed high. For her personally, she 
said, she wanted to be able to say on her 
gravestone: Mission Accomplished! 
While she didn’t accomplish everything on 
her ambitious dream list, she accomplished a 
lot in her decades of advocacy for these war 
sheroes. In 2014, she and five other Rosies 
were invited to the White House and met with 
President Obama and then-Vice President 
Biden, even snatching a hug from him. Con-
gressman HUFFMAN carried, and I cospon-
sored, a bill that designated March 21 as 
Rosie the Riveter Day during Women’s History 
Month. It has to be renewed each year, but 
we do have a national holiday, thanks in large 
part to Phyllis’ work. I carried, and Congress-
man HUFFMAN cosponsored, the Rosie the 
Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act which 
was signed into law in December 2020. The 
U.S. mint is now in the process of designing 
the medal and Phyllis was deeply involved in 
sharing her design ideas with the mint. 
In 2019, Phyllis and two fellow Rosies trav-
eled to France for the 75th Anniversary of D- 
Day. In a letter to Senator SCHUMER, she 
wrote that the people of France honored their 
work with parades, a banquet, gifts and a 
medal. In 2000, The Rosie the Riveter WWII 
Home Front National Historical Park opened 
its doors in Richmond, due to the advocacy of 
Phyllis and her fellow Rosies. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Phyllis 
Gould 
never 
stopped fighting for the Rosies and she re-
fused to take no for an answer. She was 
fiercely independent. She lived alone in her 
apartment and drove a stick shift truck up until 
a few days before she fell ill at 99. She proud-
ly displayed photos of the herself with the 
President and Vice President and Members of 
Congress. She didn’t have a computer or cell 
phone, but she made countless phone calls 
from her landline and wrote countless hand-
written letters to federal and state elected offi-
cials to plead for proper recognition of these 
war heroes. In our book, she has permission 
to write Mission Accomplished on her grave-
stone.

HONORING NAREH MANOOKI AS A 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize 
a 
remarkable 
woman, 
Nareh 
Manooki of Burbank, California. 
After graduating from high school, Nareh at-
tended the University of California San Diego 
(UCSD). During her junior year at UCSD, 
Nareh started to work part-time for the Boeing 
Company, joining full time after graduating 
from UCSD with a Bachelor of Science degree 
in Aerospace Engineering, followed by a Mas-
ter of Science degree in Product Development

Engineering from the University of Southern 
California. At Boeing, she assumed leadership 
roles in extracurricular groups, including Boe-
ing Women in Leadership and the Amelia Ear-
hart Society. Nareh learned complicated proc-
esses and procedures when working on the 
787 nacelle, and became lead of the project, 
receiving awards for her work on the project. 
Nareh decided to make a shift in her career 
after the birth of her son. An experienced en-
gineer who never lost sight of her passion for 
tutoring and helping people, she joined Glen-
dale Community College (GCC) in 2018 as an 
instructor of engineering, where she currently 
teaches several classes including Introduction 
to Engineering and 3D Printing and Modeling. 
Soon after, Nareh was also hired to teach at 
Los Angeles Pierce College and Los Angeles 
City College, where she continues to teach 
today. 
In addition to sharing her personal and pro-
fessional experiences in the engineering in-
dustry with her students, Nareh also supports 
her students outside of the classroom with 
hands-on opportunities that benefit them and 
the community, especially supporting under-
represented minorities in STEM. When the 
coronavirus pandemic hit and everyone was 
sent home, the work outside the classroom 
seemed to be at a standstill. While Ms. 
Manooki was working remotely, she wanted to 
do something to help frontline workers, and 
while researching on line, she came across ar-
ticles about 3D printing Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE). With the support of the 
GCC leadership, Nareh brought home the 
school’s 3D printers to test different designs 
she had found for clinically tested products to 
donate to hospitals. She also discovered that 
there were many like-minded college instruc-
tors in California, with whom she shared the 
approved mask designs and learned the 
agreements and processes they established 
with local hospitals for donations. 
Soon, the networking between GCC and 
local 
hospitals 
blossomed, 
and 
donation 
agreement forms were coming in. Nareh was 
printing with two or three 3D printers in her 
home from morning until evening, while simul-
taneously fulfilling her teaching and parental 
responsibilities. To meet the demands faster, 
she reached out to colleagues and students 
for help, who enthusiastically joined her ef-
forts, and together as a team, they donated 
over two thousand face shields and ear ten-
sion straps to the community. Following the 
success of this effort, Ms. Manooki thought of 
ways to bring back opportunities for students 
to have hands-on projects while learning re-
motely. In May 2020, the Glendale College 
Foundation approved her proposed program to 
advise and mentor students on how to learn to 
operate 3D printers and improve existing PPE 
designs. The program proved to be a success. 
Nareh’s students designed and created their 
own prototypes while gaining hands-on engi-
neering technology skills during a pandemic 
school year. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Nareh Manooki. 
RECOGNIZING DOUGLAS COUNTY, 
CO, BEING NAMED THE SECOND 
HEALTHIEST COMMUNITY IN THE 
U.S. 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate Douglas County, Colorado, being 
named the second healthiest community in the 
United States by U.S. News and World Report 
in 2021. Douglas County was ranked second 
in the nation in both 2020 and 2018 and 
topped the annual list in 2019. 
Douglas County enjoys 300 days of sun-
shine each year and, thanks to the beautiful 
Rocky Mountains, is home to some of the 
world’s best hiking and outdoor recreation. 
Surrounded by 63,000 acres of natural land, 
Douglas County is home to three state parks, 
the Reuter-Hess Reservoir, and incredible 
walking trails, like the Devil’s Head National 
Recreation Trail. These natural areas are im-
portant to the community as they provide rec-
reational opportunities like fishing, hiking, 
boating, and biking to be enjoyed by residents. 
This recognition as the second healthiest 
county is a testament to not only the beautiful 
natural areas of the Centennial State, but also 
its local government officials and those who 
call Douglas County home. As one of the fast-
est growing communities in the country, Doug-
las County has been ranked by the American 
City Business Journal as one of the best 
counties in the U.S. for quality of life. 
On behalf of the 4th Congressional District 
of Colorado, I am honored to celebrate this 
recognition alongside the residents and local 
government of Douglas County, Colorado.

REMEMBERING NANCY THOMAS 
WOOD 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, South Carolina will always cherish 
the dedicated service of Nancy Thomas Wood 
as an educator in Lexington District 5 of 
Seven Oak Elementary School, which I have 
gratefully represented in the State Senate and 
now Congress. 
Mrs. Wood has been an inspiration for her 
daughter Lou Kennedy, who has been recog-
nized as being one of the state’s most suc-
cessful business leaders. 
Just last week, President and CEO Lou 
Kennedy of Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corp., 
announced a $215.8 million expansion cre-
ating 380 new jobs. 
I appreciate the opportunity to include in the 
RECORD
the following obituary for Nancy 
Thomas Wood. 
NANCY THOMAS WOOD 
December 1, 1938–July 26, 2021 
Nancy Thomas Wood, of Lexington, passed 
away on Monday, July 26, 2021. 
Mrs. Wood, a loving wife and mother, was 
an educator for more than 40 years. She 
taught first grade in Lexington District 5, 
spending most of her career as a teacher at 
Seven Oaks Elementary School. Nothing— 
save her family—gave Mrs. Wood more satis-
faction than loving and mentoring thousands 
of Midlands-area students, who loved her 
back. She also taught Sunday school and Va-
cation Bible School. 
Mrs. Wood relocated to Cayce from Kings-
port, Tennessee, when husband Jerry took a 
management job at Eastman Chemical Com-
pany. The mother of Lou Wood Kennedy, 
Mrs. Wood settled into life in the Midlands, 
where she cheered each promotion Jerry 
earned and motivated her daughter to work 
hard, give back and treat everyone with 
grace. 
Mrs. Wood met her husband when they 
were teenagers, and they began dating as 
students at East Tennessee State University. 
Her father-in-law married the couple, and 
they recently celebrated 61 years together. 
Mrs. Wood drove daughter Lou to extra-
curricular activities Lou was involved in 
growing up, and made certain Lou was 
equipped with the tools she needed to suc-
ceed. 
Surviving Mrs. Wood are her devoted hus-
band, Jerry; loving daughter, Lou Wood Ken-
nedy of Lexington (Bill); granddaughter, 
Xanna Bailey of Lexington (Travis) and 
great-grandson, Lincoln Bailey. Mrs. Wood is 
also survived by Paul Wood (Mildred), Sarah 
Benson, Daniel Wood (Cara), Becky Reece 
(Chuck), countless nieces and nephews and 
the Seven Oaks family, with whom she loved 
to spend time. 
Mrs. Wood was predeceased by her parents; 
brother, Donald Thomas; sister, Mary Wills 
and brother-in-law, Lewis Wills. She was also 
predeceased by brothers-in-law, Lambert and 
David Wood and other members of the Wood 
family. 
Visitation will be held from 5:00–6:45 PM on 
Wednesday, July 28 at Caughman-Harman 
Funeral Home in Lexington and a celebra-
tion of life will follow from 6:45–7:15 PM at 
the funeral home. A private family burial 
will be held on Thursday, July 29 at 10:00 
AM.

VOTING RIGHTS ACT 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I proudly 
represent Alabama’s 7th District—the Civil 
Rights District—which includes the historic cit-
ies of Birmingham, Montgomery and my 
hometown of Selma. 
I am honored to participate in the Congres-
sional Black Caucus Special Order Hour on 
the heels of the anniversary of the death of 
the great Congressman John R. Lewis, my 
dear friend and mentor. I would also be remiss 
if I did not acknowledge the passing of Robert 
Parris Moses, another civil rights icon who 
was beaten and jailed while fighting for the 
precious right to vote. I am reminded daily of 
the sacrifices made by John, Robert, and the 
other countless foot soldiers. 
For me, growing up in Selma, under the 
shadow of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the his-
tory of the Voting Rights Movement was not 
something I had to learn in school. 
The Foot Soldiers of the Movement were 
not pictures or names in a history book, they 
were a vital and vibrant part of the community 
in Selma—they were my teachers, my church 
members, my piano teacher, our firefighters 
and even my babysitter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E827 
July 27, 2021 
Their valiant, collective efforts put Selma on 
the map in a way that no one could have 
imagined, so much so that we still celebrate 
and commemorate those efforts today. 
The 
movement 
continues, 
because 
it 
must—because the fight for equity is as impor-
tant now as it was in 1965. Selma is still now. 
Old Battles have become new again. Since 
the Supreme Court in Shelby County vs. Hold-
er gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in 
2013, state legislatures all across the nation 
have passed restrictive voter laws making it 
harder for people to vote, especially for Black 
Americans and other minority voters. 
Today, driven by the Big Lie of a ‘‘stolen 
election,’’ opponents to our democracy have 
ramped up their efforts to restrict access to 
the ballot box. 
Just this year, lawmakers have introduced 
at least 389 bills in 48 states that would re-
strict the right to vote. And in 17 states, these 
anti-voter bills have already been signed into 
law. These laws are intended to allow politi-
cians to pick and choose whose voices are 
heard by subjecting voters to: 
longer lines, 
inaccessible polling places, 
strict voter ID requirements, 
broken voting machines, 
purges of voter rolls, 
and voter registration complications. 
These new tactics may not require us to 
count how many jellybeans are in a jar or re-
cite the names of every county in Alabama, 
they are the same old tricks in disguise. In-
deed, voter suppression is still alive and well. 
As if these bills weren’t enough, earlier this 
month, the Supreme Court upheld Arizona’s 
discriminatory, anti-voter laws that were de-
signed to target Latino and other minority vot-
ers. Specifically, the Court found that Arizo-
na’s out-of-precinct policy, which requires bal-
lots to be thrown out if they were not cast in 
the assigned precinct, and its third-party ballot 
collection policy, which limits who can collect 
vote-by-mail ballots, were not discriminatory 
and did not violate section 2 of the Voting 
Rights Act. Simply put, the Court got it wrong. 
Arizona’s out-of-precinct and third-party col-
lection ballot policies created unfair burdens 
and disproportionately impacted minority vot-
ers and, as a result, Arizona’s election system 
was not equally open to all Arizona voters, 
particularly for Native American, Hispanic, and 
Black voters. Unfortunately, with this ruling the 
Court chose not to protect the precious right to 
vote and instead weakened a different provi-
sion of the Voting Rights Act, section 2, and 
made it harder for victims of voter discrimina-
tion to seek justice. 
Let me be clear: Today we face a critical 
juncture. We are up against the most coordi-
nated state-level effort to restrict the right to 
vote in generations and a Supreme Court 
keen on destroying our nation’s most impor-
tant voting rights law. 
Luckily, we have a solution. 
Democrats in Congress are committed to 
passing federal legislation to restore and pro-
tect the sacred right to vote for generations to 
come, and I’m so proud to be leading that 
fight. 
My bill, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act, 
or H.R. 4, would restore and modernize key 
provisions of the Voting Rights Act that were 
gutted by the Supreme Court. It would once 
again prohibit any state or jurisdiction with a 
history of discrimination from implementing 
any 
election 
changes 
without 
receiving 
preclearance from U.S. Department of Justice. 
The need for Congress to pass the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Act has never been so ur-
gent. Without federal protections against dis-
crimination, states across the country have 
and will continue to enact new voter suppres-
sion tactics that subject voters to: longer lines; 
inaccessible polling places; strict voter ID re-
quirements; broken voting machines; and 
more. 
That’s why I’m hard at work drafting this leg-
islation with the House Judiciary Committee 
and stakeholder groups. We are on track to 
have the bill ready for introduction in the com-
ing weeks. 
Never did I think the cause for which John 
Lewis marched for 56 years ago—the Voting 
Rights Act would require congressional action 
to restore its full protection. 
It reminds us that progress is elusive and 
every generation must fight and fight again. 
The legacy of my district requires that I pick 
up this baton of voter equality and continue 
the next leg—their Cause is my Cause too. 
I look forward to introducing H.R. 4, The 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act, because the 
reality is—we have not yet achieved the Amer-
ica that John dreamed of. 
John knew that our Country’s best days lie 
ahead of us, but we must seize the opportuni-
ties to enact change every day. 
He understood that democracy is not the 
whim or edict of one person; it is a constant, 
collective act of reinvention. We are a nation 
founded on a call to action—to strive daily for 
a more perfect union. 
Every one of us has a role to play. As lead-
ers we must lead and as citizens we must 
Vote. 
May we all recommit ourselves to the ideals 
of equality and justice for which the foot sol-
diers marched. Let our words and actions stir 
the soul of our Nation. 
John gave us his final Call to Action: John 
said, ‘‘Never give up, Never give in, Keeping 
the faith, Keep your eyes on the prize.’’ 
Let’s get into Good Trouble.

IN HONOR OF DEAN CHRISTON 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Dean Christon on the occasion of 
his retirement as Director and Chief Executive 
Officer of New Hampshire Housing. 
Dean is as steadfast advocate for affordable 
housing and community development across 
New Hampshire. It was an honor to work 
alongside Dean, his team at New Hampshire 
Housing and countless other developers and 
advocates to see so many impactful projects 
come together, like Boulder Point Veterans 
Housing in Plymouth and the Pine Tree Lane 
Apartments in West Lebanon. 
I commend Dean Christon on his retirement 
after more than three decades with New 
Hampshire Housing and on his unwavering 
dedication to the Granite State. Dean also 
serves as the Vice Chair of the Advisory 
Board of the Saint Anselm College Center for 
Ethics in Society and is a trustee of 
NeighborWorks Southern NH, a testament to 
his commitment to housing security and to the 
future leaders of our state. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s Second Congressional District, I thank 
Dean for his many years of service, and for 
being a part of what makes the Granite State 
so great. I am honored to recognize and con-
gratulate Dean on his retirement and wish him 
the best of luck in the years ahead.

IN HONOR OF THE 31ST ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH 
DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I wish to honor the 31st Anniversary 
of the enactment of the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act of 1990. The law prohibits dis-
crimination by private and public institutions 
toward citizens with disabilities, mandating that 
any entity covered by the law take reasonable 
steps to make their property, lines of commu-
nication, and employment accessible to per-
sons with disabilities. In the two decades since 
the law’s passage, it has opened the door for 
million Americans to participate more fully in 
day-to-day activities and to pursue opportuni-
ties in society. One out of every five American 
households has a family member who has a 
physical or cognitive disability. This historic bill 
expanded access to physical buildings and 
countless activities, easing the ability of these 
citizens to go about their daily lives freely with-
out concern that they will be denied access to 
a school, shopping center, business, or com-
munication device. Access is a freedom that 
everyone should enjoy, and I am proud to cel-
ebrate two decades of a law designed to pro-
mote this freedom for so many. I am proud 
that many of the accommodations that re-
sulted from this law are considered common-
place now. 
My Congressional District has long sup-
ported the efforts to promote equal civil rights. 
Chicago has been a leader in the movement 
to improve the livelihood of Americans with 
disabilities. 
The Affordable Care Act included legislative 
provisions from my bill H.R. 1670, the Com-
munity First Choice Option, which allows 
states to include within their Medicaid State 
Plans an option to receive community-based 
services for individuals with disabilities who 
are eligible for nursing homes and other insti-
tutional settings. The Community First Choice 
Option gives people the choice to leave facili-
ties and institutions for their own homes and 
communities with appropriate, cost effective 
services and supports. We should build on the 
precedent set 3 decades ago with the enact-
ment of the ADA by giving Americans with dis-
abilities the freedom to choose where they 
live. 
Equality is a founding principle of our coun-
try. It has been an arduous process for many 
groups of people—from the Emancipation 
Proclamation to the Nineteenth Amendment 
for women’s suffrage to the Civil Rights Act of 
1964. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990 was another milestone in equality for our 
Nation. Thousands of individuals worked in 
earnest to make this law possible, and thou-
sands continue to champion this law’s imple-
mentation. For these efforts, we honor the

IN RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT 
OLAN 
ARMSTRONG 
OF 
THE 
ARVIN POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Lieutenant Olan Arm-
strong on his retirement from the City of Arvin 
Police Department after 43 years of service. 
Born and raised in Arvin, California, Lieuten-
ant Armstrong has dedicated his life to serving 
his community. While attending Arvin High 
School, Lieutenant Armstrong was as an ac-
tive member of the Arvin Police Explorers pro-
gram which prepares youth for law enforce-
ment careers through assistance with commu-
nity events. After graduation, Lieutenant Arm-
strong went on to lead a successful career 
within the Arvin Police Department while dedi-
cating countless hours to various volunteer or-
ganizations. 
During his career, Lieutenant Armstrong 
worked as both a volunteer ambulance driver 
and volunteer fireman for the City of Arvin and 
surrounding areas. He has also coached and 
umpired the Arvin Little League, served as co-
ordinator for the Arvin Police Explorer Pro-
gram, and served as board member for the 
Bear Mountain Recreation Department. 
Lieutenant Armstrong truly dedicated his life 
to volunteerism and community service. He 
made great efforts to serve the City of Arvin 
throughout his lifetime and has remained an 
integral part of the community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Lieutenant Olan Armstrong for his life-
time of service to the City of Arvin, California, 
and congratulating him on his recent retire-
ment.

MOHAMMAD 
SIDDIQUE SHEIKH’S SERVICE TO 
OUR GREAT COMMONWEALTH OF 
VIRGINIA 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, since mov-
ing to the United States from Gujranwala, 
Pakistan, Mr. Sheikh has served his commu-
nity diligently through successful entrepreneur-
ship and advocacy for the Pakistani American 
and Muslim communities. 
Mr. Sheikh’s dedication and commitment to 
the Pakistani American community has had a

HONORING CATHERINE Y. KIM AS 
A 
28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DIS-
TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Catherine Y. 
Kim of the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles, 
California. 
Born and raised in Los Feliz, Catherine is a 
proud child of Korean immigrants. After at-
tending Lyce´e International de Los Angeles in 
Los Feliz, she continued her higher education 
at New York University, graduating with a 
Bachelor of Science degree in Media, Culture, 
and Communications and a minor in Art His-
tory. 
After working in New York City in public re-
lations and the fashion industry, Catherine 
moved back to Los Angeles. While volun-
teering as a member of the League of Women 
Voters, Catherine recognized the importance 
of being involved at the local level to make a 
difference in the community. With a wealth of 
experience as the past chair of the East Holly-
wood Los Feliz Homeless Coalition, and 
former Vice President of the Los Feliz Neigh-
borhood Council, where she is currently a 
member, Ms. Kim cofounded SELAH Neigh-
borhood Homeless Coalition (SELAH). SELAH 
is a community-based volunteer organization 
devoted to supporting her unhoused neighbors 
in Silver Lake, Echo Park, Los Feliz, Atwater 
Village and East Hollywood. 
Ms. Kim’s passion for helping the commu-
nity became even more evident when the 
coronavirus (COVID–19) pandemic began. 
She was instrumental in guiding SELAH to 
serve those in-need through countless ways, 
from providing showers, case management/ 
housing navigation, meals, hygiene supplies, 
and clothing to initiating an emergency food 
program. In addition, Catherine was instru-
mental in distributing COVID–19 education 
material and Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE) to the unhoused communities impacted 
by the closing of regular homeless food and 
assistance programs. In the Fall of 2020, 
Catherine joined the Los Angeles County De-
partment of Health Services Housing for 
Health division COVID Response Team as a 
Procurement Specialist, working during a time 
of a global supply chain crisis to ensure that 
county quarantine and isolation sites came on-
line as fast as possible, and that COVID–19 
testing teams for individuals facing homeless-
ness were protected with PPE when out in the 
field. Presently, Ms. Kim is committed to sup-
porting the efforts of Los Angeles County in 
COVID–19 vaccine education, administration, 
and outreach in the unhoused community, and 
also coordinating SELAH’s roving and on-site 
vaccine clinics for areas that are overlooked or 
hard to reach. 
Catherine enjoys empowering people to 
serve their community and encouraging them 
to partake in civic engagement. She likes 
painting, visiting museums, scuba diving, at-
tending concerts, hiking in Griffith Park, and 
walking in her neighborhood. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring this exceptional, well-re-
spected woman of California’s 28th Congres-
sional District, Catherine Y. Kim.

HONORING DR. JOSE´ CELSO 
BARBOSA 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor the memory of Dr. Jose´ Celso 
Barbosa, born 157 years ago today. 
Dr. Barbosa, the father of the Puerto Rican 
Statehood movement, was a distinguished 
physician, politician and publisher, and found-
er of the Republican Party in Puerto Rico. 
Born in the city of Bayamon, in a time when 
a black man had limited opportunities, he 
broke barriers and studied medicine at the 
University of Michigan, where he grew to un-
derstand the values of the United States, and 
when he came back to Puerto Rico in 1880 he 
began to challenge the Spanish colonial sys-
tem, becoming active in seeking greater home 
rule. 
When Puerto Rico became part of the 
United States after the Spanish American 
War, Barbosa saw in the American Constitu-
tion and in Statehood the way to ensure de-
mocracy, liberty and equality for the people of 
his Island. Establishing the Republican Party 
in Puerto Rico on the 4th of July 1899, he be-
came the strongest and most fervent voice in 
favor of American law and institutions. From 
his positions both in the Executive Cabinet 
and later in the Senate of Puerto Rico, he 
steadfastly insisted that this should mean full 
equality as a State of the Union. 
For a century since his passing, generations 
of leaders in Puerto Rico across all social di-
vides have followed the inspiration of Barbosa, 
striving to make his aspiration a reality: for the 
people of Puerto Rico to fully participate as 
American Citizens, contributing to the nation

and sharing in its future, by having our Island 
become a State of the Union. 
That was his ideal and it is mine, and that 
of many in Puerto Rico. Just last November, 
a majority of our voters said Yes to Barbosa’s 
vision, electing statehood. I am here to make 
sure that their voice is heard, as the best way 
to honor his memory and reaffirm his goal. 
Barbosa’s memory lives on, in everyone 
who seeks justice and equality for Puerto 
Rico.

HONORING 
BRIAN 
WAGNER 
FOR 
RETIRING 
AS 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
POSTAL SUPERVISORS 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to honor and congratulate Brian Wagner on 
his retirement as National Association of Post-
al Supervisors President. 
Brian has dedicated forty-three years to the 
betterment of the Postal Service. His incred-
ible career began in Peoria, IL, in 1978. 
Twelve years later, Brian worked his way up 
to the role of Delivery & Retail Analyst and 
joined the National Association of Postal Su-
pervisors (NAPS). After entering the USPS 
Management Trainee Program, Brian attained 
the role of Customer Relations Coordinator for 
the Peoria area. He retired from this role in 
2015, marking the end of his exceptional ten-
ure serving the Peoria area in the Postal Serv-
ice. 
Like his work for the Postal Service, Brian’s 
involvement with NAPS highlights a robust ef-
fort to represent and assist his fellow postal 
workers. During his time at NAPS, Brian was 
President of Heart of IL Branch 255, Illinois 
State Area Vice President, and NAPS Sec-
retary/Treasurer. He also served on the Exec-
utive Board as Central Region Vice President. 
Brian was elected NAPS National President in 
2016 and reelected in 2018, a testament to his 
lifelong commitment to and advocacy for the 
Postal Service and its employees. 
I want to express the utmost gratitude to 
Brian. I am certain that my fellow Peorians 
feel the same pride and respect towards him 
that I do. His career serves as an example of 
how to honorably serve the public. He has un-
doubtedly improved the lives of Peorians and 
Americans more broadly. Most importantly, 
Brian accomplished all this while being a lov-
ing husband, father, and grandfather. Con-
gratulations Brian, and I wish you happiness 
and relaxation in retirement.

FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO 
VOTE 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 26, 2021 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, let me start 
off by making one thing clear. The 15th 
amendment of the United States Constitution 
says, ‘‘The right of citizens of the United 
States to vote shall not be denied or abridged 
by the United States or by any State on ac-
count of race, color, or previous condition of 
servitude.’’ 
And so, I challenge the Supreme Court’s 
decision that gutted Section 5 of the Voting 
Rights Act. The Supreme Court’s interpretation 
does the exact opposite of the 15th Amend-
ment to the Constitution. But since the 2020 
election that broke voter participation records 
and gave us a democratic majority, Georgia 
has been ground-zero for voter suppression 
efforts in this country. 
Because Black people came out to vote in 
record numbers, Republican lawmakers in 
Georgia moved with lightning speed and sur-
gical precision to restrict voting rights. State 
lawmakers reached deep into their bag of 
tricks, including eliminating ballot drop box lo-
cations, limiting voting days and hours, insti-
tuting strict ID requirements, and even going 
as far as trying to make it a crime to distribute 
food and water to people waiting in long voting 
lines. It’s clear that these laws aren’t about 
protecting voters. It’s about punishing voters 
for exercising their right to vote. 
But it’s not only Georgia. Since Election 
Day, we have been experiencing an all-out 
anti-democratic assault on our voting rights. 
Eighteen states, all led by Republican gov-
ernors, have enacted voter suppression laws 
because they know that when we vote, they 
lose. They’re playing scared, but we have got 
to play smart. 
We have seen this type of backlash before. 
And just as we did in the 1960’s, we must 
pass new civil rights legislation, including the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the 
People Act, to protect and expand voting 
rights. 
The legislation named after my dear friend 
and civil rights icon, the late Congressman 
John Lewis, would restore the Voting Rights 
Act to its full strength, and stem the tide 
against this flood of voter suppression laws. 
The For The People Act establishes auto-
matic voter registration. It prohibits the most 
common forms of voter roll purges. It in-
creases access to the polls. It restores voting 
rights for the formerly incarcerated, among 
many other democracy saving provisions. 
After an election filled with big lies and 
scare tactics, that culminated in the violent 
January 6 insurrection, the American people 
deserve hard assurances that their vote and 
their voice will continue to count. So, if the 
Senate needs to eliminate the filibuster to pro-
tect voting rights, then that is exactly what it 
must do. 
This fight that we are in to protect our sa-
cred right to vote is critical and urgent. Our 
democracy is on the line, and we are not with-
out options to try and save it.
