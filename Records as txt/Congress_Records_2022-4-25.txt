prayer: 
God our creator, redeemer, and sus-

In Your divine grace, You have given 
us all we need to face the opportunities 
and challenges that lie ahead this day. 
Empower us with everything we need 
to live a godly life, a life which reflects 
Your great goodness in a world over-
come with evil and hatred. Strengthen 
us with Your divine nature that we 
would stand above corruptive and cor-
rosive selfish desire. 
Instead, 
may 
the 
words 
of 
our 
mouths, the decisions we make, and 
the lives we lead reflect the righteous-
ness to which our faith aspires. 
May we add Your wisdom to our at-
tempts of kindness, self-control and 
perseverance to our know-how, godli-
ness to our perseverance, mutual affec-
tion to our godliness, and to our regard 
for one another, the most important 
quality: love. 
So may our work be effective and our 
lives beneficial, as we seek to serve our 
communities, our country, and You. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

friendship, integrity, and faithfulness.

had each morning before he convened

blessed us by striving to do Your will. 
Lord, he consistently upheld the stand-
ards of excellence, civility, and ac-
countability. 
Inspired by this long and consequen-

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING LORENZO CERVANTES 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
week, America and Illinois lost a hero. 
Lorenzo Cervantes was his name. He 
had been a steelworker living in the 
small town of Sterling, IL, in the Rock 
River Valley. That is an hour or two 
west of Chicago. 
Mr. Cervantes was 98 years old. When 
he was a young man, he set out to save 
the world. He joined the U.S. Army in 
February of 1943, during World War II, 
before he had reached the age of 20. He 
was a member of an elite group. There 
was an American-Canadian commando 
unit known as the First Special Serv-
ice Force, a top-secret band of brothers 
operating deep behind enemy lines. 
The Forcemen, as they were known, 
earned the nickname ‘‘The Devil’s Bri-
gade’’ from terrified Nazi soldiers and 
officers who said that they seemed to 
appear out of nowhere in the dead of 
night, like devils. 
That unit he served in suffered one of 
the highest casualty rates in the war. 
Listen to these figures. Of the 2,400 
men who fought with the unit, 2,300 of 
them were either killed or wounded, 
but they never lost a mission—not one. 
The First Special Service Force ex-
isted for only 2 years, but the spirit of 
that force lives on in the Green Berets, 
Army Rangers, Navy SEALS, Marine 
Raiders, Canadian Special Operations 
Regiment, and, frankly, all of today’s 
military Special Forces. 
For decades after World War II, the 
very existence of that unit remained 
top 
secret 
and 
classified. 
The 
Forcemen didn’t tell anyone what they 
had done in the war, not even their 
families. Like Lorenzo Cervantes, they 
quietly returned home, married, raised 
families, and lived ordinary lives. 
In 2015, some 70 years after the end of 
World War II, they were finally hon-
ored for their service, and Congress 
awarded them the Congressional Gold 
Medal. 
I had the privilege of meeting two 
other Forcemen from Illinois at that 
Gold Medal ceremony. Casey Celske 
was one of them. He fought with the 
Devil’s Brigade at the Battle of Anzio— 
one of the Allies’ greatest surprise vic-
tories. He was among the first Allied 
soldiers to enter Rome and liberate it 
from the Nazis. 
Mr. Celske died 3 years ago, also age 
98. After the war, he had returned to Il-
linois and married. He and his wife had 
11 children—11. 
In 1995, 50 years after the war ended, 
Mr. Celske and one of his sons decided 
to go back to Europe to take a look 
and see the places where the First Spe-
cial Service Force had fought and to 
visit the towns that the Force liber-
ated. 
Near 
the 
Anzio 
beachhead, 
they 
spoke to an Italian man. When the man 
realized who they were, he dropped to 
his knees, broke out in tears, and 
thanked Casey Celske of Illinois.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2116 
April 25, 2022 
The Italian man said to his son: This 
is one of the soldiers who saved our vil-
lage. 
Casey Celske turned to his son and 
said: All these years, I wondered what 
I was doing. Now I know. 
UKRAINE 
Madam President, after World War II, 
the United States and the leading free 
nations of Europe worked together to 
create a new system of rules and insti-
tutions to guard the peace of World 
War II and to reduce the risk in Europe 
that we would ever again descend into 
the hell of war. The most important of 
these new institutions was called the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization— 
NATO. Among its most important new 
rules was the commitment that na-
tions must never again wage wars of 
conquest against their neighbors. For 
more than 75 years, the new rules and 
institutions largely helped keep the 
peace 
in 
Europe, 
but 
then 
came 
Ukraine. 
With its barbaric attack on Ukraine, 
Russia is waging war not only against 
a 
sovereign 
nation—an 
innocent, 
unprovoked nation—Russia is attack-
ing the very system of democracy and 
rules-based order for which 400,000 U.S. 
servicemembers died in World War II 
and many more have given their lives 
since. 
Vladimir Putin is seeking to restore 
some mythical Russian Empire. He 
wants to demolish NATO, and he wants 
to drag the world back into a blood- 
soaked past, when Kings and tyrants 
waged wars of conquest to expand their 
territory and fill their coffers. 
As Russia’s barbaric, blood-thirsty 
war against Ukraine enters its third 
month, it is clear that Vladimir Putin 
has 
miscalculated 
disastrously. 
He 
thought 
his 
forces 
were 
so 
over-
whelming that he would occupy Kyiv, 
the capital of Ukraine, in a matter of 
days; that he would remove Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy from power in Ukraine and 
that he would install a puppet govern-
ment that would once again take or-
ders from Moscow. 
Instead, Kyiv still stands, Zelenskyy 
is still in control, and Vladimir Putin 
has been frustrated by the determina-
tion, courage, and resiliency of the 
Ukrainian 
troops. He has suffered 
heavy losses. Russia has lost the battle 
for 
Ukraine 
to 
date. 
Vladimir 
Zelenskyy is still Ukraine’s President, 
and Russian forces are demoralized and 
depleted. 
Instead of seizing Kyiv and all of 
Ukraine, Russia is now regrouping to 
try to pick one region that they can 
conquer, 
the 
Donbas 
region—which 
they have illegally occupied since 
2014—and to seize the Black Sea Port of 
Mariupol. 
Russia’s 
economy 
is 
increasingly 
staggering under the weight of some of 
the most powerful sanctions ever levied 
against any nation in the history of 
the world. The effect of these sanctions 
against Russia will become even more 
onerous in the months ahead as Russia 
is unable to buy parts and equipment 
to keep its basic industries thriving 
and other key sectors of its economy 
functioning. 
The 
sanctions 
also 
target 
the 
oligarchs, the kleptocrats, Putin’s fra-
ternity who helped prop up his corrupt 
regime. They are losing their super-
yachts—isn’t that a heartbreaker— 
their vacation dachas, and some are 
starting to lose their lives—strangely, 
a fate that seems to befall a number of 
people who get close to Russia’s KGB 
thug who happens to be the leader in 
Russia today. 
The Russian Government has given 
up any pretense it once had after the 
breakup of the Soviet Union of ever be-
coming a democracy. I say that with 
some sadness for the people of Russia. 
They have been relegated to the role of 
pawns in Putin’s escapade. 
A new censorship law has taken ef-
fect. It makes it a crime punishable by 
up to 15 years in prison to even de-
scribe the invasion of Ukraine as a 
‘‘war’’ or to describe Russia’s assault 
on Ukraine in honest terms. You can 
go to prison for that in Mr. Putin’s 
Russia. 
It was just a few weeks ago that I 
met upstairs in my office with a Rus-
sian journalist and opposition leader. 
His name is Vladimir Kara-Murza. Mr. 
Kara-Murza is fearless. He survived 
poisoning attempts by the Kremlin 
twice. He told me several weeks ago, 
‘‘I’m going back.’’ 
I said, ‘‘Why?’’ 
He said, ‘‘There is work to be done.’’ 
He told me about his opposition to 
Russia’s war in Ukraine, the increasing 
opposition to the war with Russia, and 
his hopes that some day Russia will be 
a part of the community of democ-
racies. Well, Mr. Kara-Murza went back 
to Moscow, and last week, he was ar-
rested—the same day CNN broadcast 
an interview in which he called Putin’s 
government ‘‘a regime of murderers.’’ 
Mr. Kara-Murza faces years of impris-
onment for simply telling the truth. 
Senator MARCO RUBIO of Florida and 
I are going to introduce a bipartisan 
resolution this week calling for Mr. 
Kara-Murza’s 
immediate 
release. 
I 
hope my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle will join us. 
Vladimir Putin also badly miscalcu-
lated the unity of NATO and the will of 
free people to defend democracy. In-
stead of shattering NATO, Putin has 
strengthened NATO. Finland and Swe-
den, longtime neutral nations, could 
soon join NATO. Germany is pursuing a 
historic dramatic overhaul of its ap-
proach to security and defense. And 
yesterday, French voters re-elected 
their President, Emmanuel Macron, de-
cisively, choosing him over his far- 
right Putin sympathizer, Marine Le 
Pen. That election in France marked 
the first time in 20 years that French 
voters have given a President a second 
term. It is widely viewed as, among 
other things, a vote of support for 
NATO and Ukraine and against Putin 
and his Russian aggression. 
Vladimir Putin also gambled that 
America would be too weak and divided 
to oppose Russia’s assault on Ukraine. 
He was badly mistaken again. Repub-
licans and Democrats are standing to-
gether in support of Ukraine, as are the 
American people. 
President Biden’s leadership has been 
critical in uniting NATO and the West 
and enabling Ukraine to defend itself. 
Yesterday, Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken 
and 
Secretary 
of 
Defense 
Lloyd Austin traveled to Kyiv and met 
with President Zelenskyy personally to 
show Putin and the world that the 
United States of America stands with 
the Ukrainian people in their heroic 
defense of their homeland. 
The U.S. is providing Ukraine with 
the 
military 
equipment 
to 
defend 
itself, but it takes the courage and de-
termination of those men and women 
in Ukraine to make it work. In the last 
2 months alone, America has com-
mitted to Ukraine an unprecedented 
$3.7 billion in military equipment, in-
cluding howitzers, helicopters, ammu-
nition, 
tactical 
drones, 
and 
more. 
Ukraine’s Armed Forces are using this 
equipment and performing brilliantly. 
The coming weeks will be difficult, 
and they may be decisive. In concen-
trating its assault on the Donbas, Rus-
sia is moving the war from cities like 
Kyiv and Kharkiv to a more wide-open 
landscape where its heavy artillery 
seems to have an advantage. In addi-
tion, many intelligence reports suggest 
that Putin is desperate for something 
he can call a military win by May 8, 
which Russia celebrates as ‘‘Victory 
Day,’’ marking the Allies’ defeat over 
Nazi Germany in World War II. 
The tragic irony is that in this war, 
Russia is using many of the same tac-
tics used in World War II: attacking a 
peaceful neighboring nation, inten-
tionally targeting civilians, and com-
mitting heinous war crimes. 
This Senate voted unanimously last 
month to condemn Vladimir Putin as a 
war criminal. We must continue to 
stand with Ukraine and for democracy 
and for the rules of civilization where 
so many Americans fought for and died 
in World War II and since. 
I started these comments on the floor 
this afternoon remembering a World 
War II vet in Illinois that just passed 
away at the age of 98, Lorenzo Cer-
vantes. I have spoken to so many of 
those vets and said: What were you 
fighting for? 
And they said: We were fighting for 
our buddies right next to us. We were 
going to bring each other home safe, so 
we kept the fight. And we were fighting 
for our families. We believed our fam-
ily name was at stake, and the courage 
we showed reflected on them. And we 
also were fighting for our nation, the 
United States, which we were proud to 
serve and risk our lives for. But most 
of all, we were fighting to make sure 
our kids didn’t have to do the same. We 
were willing to sacrifice, even give our 
lives, so our kids could live in a peace-
ful world. 
Well, for almost 80 years that was a 
fact after World War II and the service

of Lorenzo Cervantes and hundreds of 
thousands of others. And then came 
Vladimir Putin with this unprovoked 
attack on Ukraine. He thought they 
would be a pushover. He had this mas-
sive Russian army mobilizing over a 
span of months ready to attack. And 
when he launched his attack, he ex-
pected the people of Ukraine to fold, 
quit, and leave. But they didn’t. They 
fought and they have been an inspira-
tion ever since. 
Putin wants to write a new world 
order. He wants to say to the living 
veterans of World War II and their fam-
ilies: You wasted your time. I can do 
this if I wish. I have the power. But he 
has run into a force he didn’t antici-
pate. The Ukrainians have done an in-
credible job, an inspiring job to the 
world. 
And I want, of course, to say a word 
of 
praise 
to 
their 
President. 
Mr. 
Zelenskyy started in life as a stand-up 
comedian. Somehow or another, he has 
become the world’s leading stand-up 
President—standing up to a tyrant like 
Vladimir Putin, inspiring people all 
around the world to join in this effort 
to save his nation. 
I am glad that the United States is 
on board, and we will continue to help 
him until Putin is finally gone. The 
genocide which he is inflicting on the 
Ukrainian people is an embarrassment 
to the 21st century. To think that this 
could happen in the so-called civilized 
western world is virtually unthinkable. 
We have got to make a stand, and I am 
glad that we have. I support President 
Biden and the NATO alliance who are 
standing behind the people of Ukraine. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING ORRIN G. HATCH 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
as the Senate convenes today, we are 
mourning the loss of our dear friend 
and legendary former colleague, Orrin 
Hatch. 
When Senator Hatch retired 3 years 
ago, this body lost its longest serving 
Republican and its President pro tem. 
We also lost one of the kindest and best 
humored colleagues any of us had ever 
served with and, for that matter, the 
Senate’s only former band manager of 
a Mormon folk music group. 
Orrin Hatch led an incredibly full, in-
teresting, and accomplished life. By 
the end of his tenure, our very funny 
colleague liked to poke fun at his own 
longevity. I remember when Orrin, a 
former Judiciary Committee chairman, 
would pretend to wistfully recall his 
work on Justice Joseph Story’s con-
firmation back in 1811. 
Humor aside, the reality was impres-
sive enough. Orrin’s dogged service for 
Utah and our Nation was a constant in 
this Chamber for 42 years. He was an 
accomplished, influential chairman of 
three major committees: HELP, Judi-
ciary, and Finance. He was an essential 
legislator behind a long list of land-
mark laws—from the Hatch-Waxman 
law on generic drugs in the 1980s to the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, to the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 
and the State Children’s Health Insur-
ance Program—all back in the 1990s— 
all the way through to the historic 2017 
tax reform that Orrin shepherded as Fi-
nance chairman. That helped engineer 
the best economic moment for Amer-
ican workers and families in modern 
history. There were also countless spe-
cific achievements for the great State 
of Utah that Orrin loved so much. 
Amid all that legislative heavy lift-
ing, Orrin was also a pivotal player 
concerning the Senate’s part in the 
personnel business. Amazingly, at the 
time of Orrin’s retirement, he had per-
sonally participated in the confirma-
tions for more than half—half—of all 
the article III judges who had ever 
served in American history. 
Orrin came into the Senate as a 
young, conservative firebrand. His first 
campaign for any public office of any 
kind was the 1976 campaign that landed 
him here. He left the Senate as a wide-
ly admired and universally liked elder 
statesman. His legacy is peppered with 
both big, principled victories, bipar-
tisan collaborations, and a roster of 
friends that spanned the entire polit-
ical spectrum and sometimes tran-
scended politics altogether. 
But there was never any confusing 
what Orrin viewed as his proudest ac-
complishment of all. That would be his 
remarkable marriage to Elaine and 
their loving family. Alphabetical order 
has perhaps never served any man bet-
ter than when ‘‘Hatch, Orrin’’ was as-
signed the chair next to ‘‘Hansen, 
Elaine’’ in a Brigham Young Univer-
sity classroom. Decades later, Orrin 
said, ‘‘I can’t remember a doggone 
thing from that astronomy class,’’ but 
the two of them got 65 inspiring years 
of marriage and a big, happy brood of 
kids and grandkids out of the bargain. 
So, today, the entire Senate stands 
with Elaine, the Hatch family, and the 
huge, huge network of friends, former 
staffers, and admirers whom Orrin 
leaves behind across Utah and across 
our country. We mourn this great loss, 
and we honor this great life. 
INFLATION 
Madam President, on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, the Senate reconvenes 
today, after Passover and Easter, to 
begin a new work period, but, unfortu-
nately, the biggest problem facing the 
American people is still the same as it 
has been all year long. Rising inflation 
is continuing to inflict painful con-
sequences on working families across 
our country. This painful problem isn’t 
getting better; it is still getting worse. 
Last month, consumer prices clocked 
an 8.5-percent year-on-year increase. 
Inflation is now rising at its fastest 
pace in more than four decades. The 
surge is being led in large part by a 
23.6-percent jump in airfares, a 35.3-per-
cent increase in used car and truck 
prices, and a 48-percent spike in the 
cost of gasoline. These are exactly the 
sorts of products consumers lean on 
most heavily in the warmer months. 
But, while March’s numbers are an 
extra cruel twist, the American people 
have been feeling the effects of the 
Biden administration’s war on domes-
tic energy for the better part of a year. 
Before most folks even began to con-
sider summer travel and long before 
Putin 
launched 
his 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine, working families were al-
ready facing soaring prices at the gas 
pump. 
Even as wage growth accelerated for 
a fifth straight month, workers’ pay-
checks once again failed to keep pace 
with the steep surge of rising prices. 
Raises and bonuses are being swallowed 
by inflation. Real wages are down 2.7 
percent year-on-year. 
Democrats’ runaway spending has 
brought us runaway inflation. Prices in 
the United States have risen higher 
and faster than in other developed 
economies. Even the New York Times 
now admits that ‘‘risks are mounting 
that America’s ambitious spending will 
end up with a checkered legacy.’’ Let 
me say that again. Even the New York 
Times now admits that ‘‘risks are 
mounting that America’s ambitious 
spending will end up with a checkered 
legacy.’’ 
But even in the face of this painful 
reality, even as every measurable indi-
cator spells out the clear consequences 
of reckless runaway spending, Wash-
ington Democrats are showing no sign 
of changing course. President Biden’s 
response to the shaky economy he cre-
ated is to propose the biggest tax hike 
in American history and double-digit 
percentage growth in domestic discre-
tionary spending. 
Democrats’ policies have working 
families deep in a financial hole, and 
our colleagues across the aisle just 
want to keep digging. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING ORRIN G. HATCH 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, before I begin 
the substance of my remarks today, I 
wanted to note how the Senate mourns 
the loss of one of its fine public serv-
ants. Senator Orrin Hatch, the longest 
serving Republican in the history of 
the Senate, the sixth longest serving 
Member ever, passed away Saturday at 
the age of 88.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2118 
April 25, 2022 
Senator Hatch was a friend, a re-
spected colleague, and a legislator of 
rare skill. In our 20 years serving to-
gether, our disagreements were fre-
quent. They often ran deep. But I al-
ways knew him to be a person of good 
faith who put the needs of his State 
above all else. 
While nobody ever mistook Senator 
Hatch for anything but a principled 
conservative, to his credit, he was 
never afraid to work with his Demo-
cratic colleagues when necessary to get 
things done, and he would make com-
promises. I was in the room many 
times when it happened, and I will al-
ways admire him for that. 
The people of Utah lost a titan this 
weekend, one that will not likely come 
through this Chamber again for a long 
time. My prayers and condolences go to 
all of Senator Hatch’s family and 
friends, especially his wife, Elaine, and 
their six children and many, many 
grandchildren. 
May he forever rest in peace, and we 
thank him for his lifetime of public 
service. 
NOMINATION OF LAEL BRAINARD 
Madam President, today, the Senate 
gavels in for the start of a 5-week work 
period, and there is much, much that 
the American people want us and need 
us to work on in order to lower costs 
and improve their daily lives. That will 
be one of our primary focuses. The Sen-
ate 
will 
also 
continue 
confirming 
President Biden’s administrative and 
judicial nominees. 
Today we will vote to advance the 
nomination of Lael Brainard to be Vice 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board 
of Governors. Ms. Brainard received bi-
partisan backing in the committee, and 
I expect her to sail through this Cham-
ber with similar bipartisan support. 
NOMINATION OF LISA DENELL COOK 
Madam President, as soon as tomor-
row, the Senate will proceed on the 
nomination of Lisa Cook to sit on the 
Federal Reserve Board of Governors. 
Coming from humble beginnings in 
rural Georgia, where her family fought 
racial segregation, Ms. Cook would 
make history as the first Black woman 
ever to sit on the Federal Reserve 
Board of Governors. Her qualifications 
are irrefutable. She is a professor of ec-
onomics at Michigan State, a member 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
Advisory Board, and served as senior 
economist in President Obama’s Coun-
cil of Economic Advisers. In short, Ms. 
Cook absolutely belongs on the Fed, 
and I look forward to the Senate con-
firming her soon. 
NOMINATION OF ALVARO M. BEDOYA 
Madam President, this week, the 
Senate 
will 
also 
confirm 
Alvaro 
Bedoya as a commissioner on the Fed-
eral Trade Commission, breaking a 2–2 
deadlock on the FTC that has lasted 
for over a year. Mr. Bedoya’s confirma-
tion is truly significant. If we want to 
lower costs, if we want to understand 
why the price of things like gasoline 
have surged, then it is important to 
break the 2–2 deadlock at the FTC so it 
can fully examine these issues and exe-
cute its agenda. 
Every time Americans go to the 
pump, they just know something truly 
rotten is going on with America’s en-
ergy sector. Last year, the top 25 oil 
and gas companies reported $205 billion 
in 
profits. 
Earlier 
this 
month, 
ExxonMobil alone reported its highest 
quarterly profits since 2008. But has 
any of this translated into lower prices 
for Americans? Has any of this gone to 
help resolve our energy challenges? Has 
any of it gone to increasing worker 
productivity? No, no, and no. 
Instead, soaring energy profits have 
fueled soaring stock buybacks. In the 
fourth quarter of last year, oil and gas 
companies’ stock buybacks rose by 
more than 2,000 percent—2,000 percent. 
They are making record profits, and 
what do the CEOs do? They artificially 
increase the value of their stocks sim-
ply by buying some of it back. That is 
not why stock should go up. 
Could they do something to reduce 
prices? Wouldn’t that help America 
more? Could they do something to 
make their oil companies—their work-
ers fare better? No. There is something 
deeply wrong, deeply wrong about see-
ing the largest oil and gas companies 
in the world drench top executives and 
wealthy shareholders with cash while 
Americans are struggling at the pump. 
That is why we need a fully func-
tioning FTC as soon as possible; so it 
can look under the hood of America’s 
energy sector and determine if rising 
prices are, in part, rooted in shady con-
duct, and I believe they are. For that 
reason, we must confirm Mr. Bedoya by 
the end of this week. 
And I say to my Republican friends, 
if you are complaining about oil and 
gas prices—gasoline prices, one of the 
best things to do is have the FTC take 
a look and propose action and act. 
On this very same note, Democrats 
are also discussing and will consider 
other potential action to beef up the 
FTC’s ability to crack down on poten-
tial gas price manipulation. We will 
have more to say on this as the week 
progresses. 
UKRAINE 
Madam President, also in the coming 
weeks, the Senate must make progress 
on several pressing legislative prior-
ities. We must, for one, continue help-
ing the people of Ukraine in their fight 
against Russian aggression. 
Last Thursday, President Biden an-
nounced the emergency funding Con-
gress approved in March is close to 
running out, and he is expected to 
make another request to Congress later 
this week. Two months into the war, 
Putin’s hopes for a quick takeover 
have all but extinguished, thanks to 
the bravery of the Ukrainian people 
and to the aid that the U.S. and other 
countries have provided the Ukrainians 
in the form of Javelins, Stingers, and 
other critical weapons. 
But as we all know, the fight is far 
from over. We must make sure the 
Ukrainian people continue to have the 
help they need for as long as they need 
it. 
Approving 
additional 
aid 
for 
Ukraine is a must, and I expect swift 
bipartisan cooperation to get it done. 
NOMINATION OF BRIDGET A. BRINK 
Madam President, this morning, the 
President also announced he will nomi-
nate Bridget Brink to serve as the next 
ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. Brink’s 
nomination is terrific news at a crit-
ical moment, and the Senate will 
prioritize her confirmation once she 
comes before the Senate and move her 
as quickly as possible. She is needed, 
and we will not tarry or delay. 
The United States has not had an 
ambassador within Ukraine since 2019, 
and Ms. Brink is an excellent choice to 
lead our diplomatic mission as we 
stand with the Ukrainian people. She is 
a longtime veteran of Eastern Euro-
pean affairs and has already been con-
firmed unanimously by the Senate to 
serve as ambassador to Slovakia. There 
is no reason both sides can’t work to-
gether quickly and expeditiously to 
confirm Ms. Brink. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, in addition to 
Ukraine funding, I will also keep work-
ing with my colleagues to pass another 
bipartisan COVID funding package. At 
the end of the last work period, a group 
of Democrats and Republicans reached 
an agreement on a funding package, 
only for every single Republican to 
vote against moving forward—every 
single one. Truly disappointing, be-
cause this funding is desperately need-
ed. 
The best way to keep life as close to 
normal in case a new COVID variant 
arises, is for Republicans to work with 
us to quickly approve more money for 
vaccines, more for testing, more money 
for lifesaving therapeutics, and other 
urgent tools to fight the pandemic. 
The longer that Senate Republicans 
hold out on working with us to approve 
new funding, the higher the cost will be 
for our country down the line. As we 
have learned already, it doesn’t take 
much for a new variant to undo a lot of 
the progress we have made in recent 
months. 
So in the coming weeks, both parties 
must come to the table and reach a 
good-faith agreement to move forward 
on COVID funding. 
It will be vital for keeping schools, 
churches, businesses, and our commu-
nities open if and when a future, more 
potent variant rears its ugly head. 
AMERICA COMPETES ACT 
Madam President, finally, this week, 
the Senate will also begin a formal 
conference committee with the House 
to finalize our jobs and competitive-
ness legislation. If there is anything 
that 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
should be able to agree on and move 
speedily on, it should certainly be a bi-
partisan bill that increases jobs, boosts 
innovation, and gets tough on the Chi-
nese Communist Party, while shoring 
up our chips manufacturing here at 
home.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2119 
April 25, 2022 
This legislation has been in the 
works for well over a year, and I know 
that Members from both sides want to 
see us enter a conference as soon as we 
can. 
As the week progresses, Republicans 
must come to the table and show they 
are willing to work with us to finalize 
a vote to enter the conference. Both 
parties in both Chambers have already 
announced their choices of who should 
serve as conferees, so the time has 
come to wrap up this process and begin 
a conference. 
I hope both sides will reach an accord 
soon so we can finish the yearlong 
work of sending the competitiveness 
legislation to the President’s desk for 
his signature. Our economy and Amer-
ican consumers will be far, far better 
off for it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the 
Senate is now, of course, back in ses-
sion following a 2-week home work pe-
riod, as we refer to it. That is when we 
get to go back home and see our friends 
and constituents and travel around our 
States. And in my case, representing 29 
million Texans, that entails a fair 
amount of travel, but it is always good 
to get reconnected with your friends 
and your neighbors and your constitu-
ents. 
I know we are eager to hit the ground 
running here this week, and certainly, 
we have a lot to do. For example, the 
conference committee process for the 
China competitiveness bill will begin 
soon, and I am eager to work with the 
fellow Members of the conference com-
mittee to reach a strong, bipartisan 
bill. 
The long list of unrelated partisan 
provisions in the House bill, though, 
have no place, in my opinion, in the 
final agreement, but I am ready to get 
the ball rolling so we can pass a bill 
that serves the American people, our 
economy, and, most importantly, our 
national security. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, in the next couple 
of weeks, as we know, we could well see 
another pandemic relief bill come to 
the floor for a vote. 
I hope this package includes a piece 
of legislation that Senator PADILLA, 
the Senator from California, and I au-
thored, that would give State and local 
governments more flexibility to spend 
their excess COVID dollars, in this 
case, on infrastructure or disaster re-
lief. 
This bill passed the Senate unani-
mously and addresses a problem com-
munities across our Nation are facing. 
And there is no reason for it to be ex-
cluded from the larger package, so I am 
optimistic. 
In the coming days, I hope the Sen-
ate will also take action to preserve 
the use of title 42, the public health 
title, addressing COVID–19, following 
the President’s reckless decision to 
eliminate it with no alternative plan in 
place, which would invite even more 
chaos at our southern border. 
Months ago, during the height of 
COVID, the Border Patrol told me that 
title 42 was helpful in repelling mi-
grants who were not claiming asylum 
and avoiding having to process them on 
this side of the border. But that was 
one of the few things, given the huge 
number of asylum claims that were 
being made, that permitted them to 
control the flow of people across the 
border, at least in some manner. 
I am proud to cosponsor a bipartisan 
bill introduced by Senator LANKFORD 
and Senator SINEMA, which would 
delay the end of title 42 until there is 
a reasonable, workable alternative in 
place. There is bipartisan support for 
this legislation, and I hope it will re-
ceive a vote here on the Senate floor 
very soon. 
These are just a few of the items on 
the Senate’s lengthy to-do list, but of 
course the single biggest item looming 
in the news and on our minds and 
hearts is the war in Ukraine. 
Over the last 2 months, Ukraine has 
endured unimaginable suffering, and 
its brave people and soldiers continue 
to fight to save their country. As 
Americans, we cannot lose sight of our 
role in the conflict. Our sons and 
daughters are not on the frontlines, nor 
are we obligated by a treaty, like the 
North Atlantic Treaty, to come to the 
aid of Ukraine. 
But I believe we have a moral respon-
sibility to aid a fellow democracy 
against this kind of unprovoked and 
outrageous aggression. We can’t just 
send 
money 
and 
weapons 
halfway 
around the world and then pat our-
selves on the back and say: Job well 
done. 
As I said, we have a moral responsi-
bility to help Ukraine not only fight 
but also to win this war. We can’t just 
prop up its forces to continue to take 
more hits without providing them a 
plan for them to sustain their efforts in 
the long run. 
Over the last couple of months, folks 
across the political spectrum have 
united in support of Ukraine. As a mat-
ter of fact, this has been one of the 
truly bipartisan responses that we have 
seen here in Congress—bipartisan sup-
port of Ukraine. 
I have to say, amid so much pain and 
suffering, it has been encouraging to 
see people around the world—not just 
here in America but around the world— 
stand shoulder-to-shoulder in support 
of Ukraine. 
As we know, since the war began, the 
United States has provided billions of 
dollars in military assistance as well as 
humanitarian relief. This has come in 
the form of everything from body 
armor to helmets, to ammunition to 
Javelin antitank missiles. 
But as we know, more is needed. 
That 
was 
the 
message 
President 
Zelenskyy delivered to Members of 
Congress. It was a message I heard 
from our partners in Europe when I 
traveled to Poland and Germany last 
month. And it is the same message we 
are hearing today: Send us the weapons 
we need to defend ourselves against 
this unprovoked and barbarous inva-
sion by the Russian Federation. 
Daily, Ukrainian soldiers and civil-
ians are being bludgeoned. We need to 
get them the resources they need to 
hold the line, and we need to continue 
to act with dispatch. 
Just before the State work period, 
the Senate passed legislation that 
would help make that more likely. It 
was called the bipartisan Ukraine De-
mocracy 
Defense 
Lend-Lease 
Act, 
which 
I 
introduced 
with 
Senator 
CARDIN, that has broad bipartisan sup-
port in the Senate, and it passed unani-
mously here early last month. 
This legislation is rooted in the same 
principle as the original Lend-Lease 
Act, which occurred during World War 
II, whereby the United States became 
what Franklin Delano Roosevelt called 
the ‘‘arsenal of democracy,’’ and we 
provided, at the time, up to $30 billion 
worth of materials—airplanes, ships, 
ammunition, all manner of weaponry— 
which allowed Great Britain to hang on 
against Nazi aggression. 
Now, if you translate the amount of 
assistance that the United States gave 
our allies in World War II under the 
Lend-Lease Act that was passed then 
and signed into law by Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, it would translate into more 
than $400 billion today. 
And I think it is important for us to 
send a strong bipartisan message that 
the U.S. Congress supports Ukraine not 
just for today, not just for tomorrow 
but for the long run. 
Now that the Senate has unani-
mously passed this bipartisan legisla-
tion, it is up to the House. As I said, 
this legislation is important, one, be-
cause it cuts the redtape and expedites 
the shipment and delivery of weapons. 
As it stands today, there are a lot of 
time-consuming 
steps 
between 
the 
United States deciding to send more re-
sources to the forces on the ground and 
between the time that the decision is 
made and the time that weapons are 
actually received. 
As we can see by the devastating vid-
eos of this war, there is no time for 
delay or redtape. Our assistance cannot 
move at the speed of the bureaucracy. 
And equally important is point No. 2. 
This bill ensures that we can send 
Ukraine 
the 
resources 
it 
actually 
needs, not just what current authori-
ties allow. 
President Zelenskyy himself said: 
Ukraine can’t shoot down Russian mis-
siles with shotguns and machineguns. 
We need to listen to what Ukraine 
needs and send those items with dis-
patch.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2120 
April 25, 2022 
That is what this legislation provides 
for, nothing more and nothing less. It 
doesn’t just help speed up the process 
of getting this equipment to Ukraine; 
it will ensure that we are actually 
sending them the items they actually 
need and can actually use. 
Now, I know I don’t have to convince 
my Senate colleagues that this is a 
good piece of legislation. We passed it 
unanimously 2 weeks ago. So we all un-
derstand what is at stake, and we are 
eager to remove the hurdles that pre-
vent the United States from arming 
the Ukrainian forces with what they 
need to win this war as soon as we can 
get it in their hands. 
I hope our Senate colleagues and the 
American people will contact our col-
leagues in the House and encourage 
them to pass the Ukraine Democracy 
Defense Lend-Lease Act this week. 
Every day we are learning more 
about 
the 
horrors 
unfolding 
in 
Ukraine. We have seen Russian war 
crimes in Bucha, and there are well- 
founded fears that the same carnage is 
unfolding in Mariupol. These develop-
ments should light a fire under our col-
leagues in the House to pass this legis-
lation as soon as possible. 
Chris Alexander is a former Canadian 
diplomat, who spent time posted at the 
Canadian Embassy in Russia. He re-
cently said: ‘‘Lend-Lease is a potential 
game-changer for the war in Ukraine.’’ 
A potential game-changer—there is 
no better way to describe this legisla-
tion or to underscore its urgency. 
Last week, the Ukrainian Prime Min-
ister himself said that our Lend-Lease 
Program is what Ukraine needs to win 
the war. 
Over the last 2 months, Ukrainian 
forces have demonstrated unbelievable 
strength and bravery. So it is time, 
once again, for the United States to 
serve as that ‘‘arsenal of democracy,’’ 
as Franklin Roosevelt called it, and en-
sure that Ukraine has the full range of 
resources it needs not just for today, 
not just for tomorrow but for the fu-
ture as well. 
After this bill passed the Senate, 
Ukraine’s Minister for Foreign Affairs 
expressed his gratitude to all 100 Sen-
ators who voted to pass the bill, and he 
said he looks forward to its swift pas-
sage in the House. 
So I would respectfully encourage 
Speaker PELOSI to bring this legisla-
tion to the floor for a vote this week so 
we can answer Ukraine’s call to pro-
vide more weapons more quickly for 
the indefinite future. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. I am coming to the 
floor again this evening to talk about 
the 
tragedy 
that 
is 
unfolding 
in 
Ukraine. This is the ninth week in a 
row during sessions that I have come 
to the floor to talk about the brutal 
and unprovoked Russian invasion of 
Ukraine—Ukraine, an ally of ours, a 
democratic country, and a sovereign 
country. 
It has now been more than 2 months 
since 
Russia’s 
assault 
began, 
and 
Ukrainians continue to fight with 
heart, toughness, and conviction. The 
Russians have been defeated in Kyiv, 
the capital of Ukraine. And the Rus-
sian Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, 
was sunk by Ukrainian Neptune mis-
siles. So there have been some suc-
cesses. But while Ukraine and its peo-
ple have impressed the free world with 
their fierce defense of their homeland, 
the senseless and indiscriminate kill-
ing of Ukrainian civilians by Russia 
continues. 
In this new stage of the war, Russia 
has begun an intensified offensive in 
the Donbas region in the eastern part 
of Ukraine. A few days ago, a Russian 
commander affirmed that their goal is 
to gain full control of Donetsk and 
Luhansk oblasts—meaning control of 
all of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine, 
rather than the roughly 50 percent they 
took in 2014, and control of southern 
Ukraine, cutting Ukraine off from its 
Black Sea ports, leaving one of the 
world’s most important exporters land-
locked. 
The commander also threatened the 
territorial integrity of the small coun-
try of Moldova that borders southern 
Ukraine by saying this would connect 
Russia to the breakaway province of 
Transnistria, where Russian troops are 
already stationed. 
It may not be coincidental that 
today we heard reports of bombs hit-
ting the Ministry of State building in 
Transnistria, when no one was there, 
by the way. Some say this could be a 
false flag attack, giving Russia an ex-
cuse to invade all of Moldova. All of 
the countries in the region are nervous 
about their status. They are worried 
for a good reason. They could be next. 
I can see why they are concerned. 
We have all seen with our own eyes 
what is going on, on television or on-
line, the videos we have seen, but let’s 
not forget, Russia continues to commit 
war crimes and display an utter dis-
regard for innocent human lives. They 
continue to prevent evacuation of ci-
vilians from Mariupol. They have exe-
cuted noncombatants, and now there 
are reports of systemic rape and tor-
ture by Russian soldiers. This is on top 
of previous confirmed reports of the 
use 
of 
cluster 
munitions 
and 
thermobaric weapons on civilians. 
As of February 28, the International 
Criminal Court announced allegations 
would be investigated. That is good. 
That must happen. But if they wait and 
have the proceedings once the war is 
over, in my view, that is too late. The 
perpetrators must be brought to jus-
tice. These horrific Russian assaults on 
innocent Ukrainian families in Bucha, 
Mariupol, and elsewhere, the bombing 
of civilian targets, the rapes, the tor-
tures, all of these are crimes against 
humanity, and Russia must be held ac-
countable for war crimes, not later but 
now. 
If there is not accountability, more 
senseless 
killings 
in 
Ukraine 
will 
occur, and these atrocities are likely to 
be repeated by others in the future. 
Many of my colleagues and I were on 
a video call today with the Ukrainian 
Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. He ex-
pressed his appreciation for the lethal 
support we have provided here in the 
U.S. Senate and in the House and 
through the administration. 
But he stressed the need for more 
help, for more heavy weapons to defend 
and push Russia back in the Donbas re-
gion. He also detailed how the coun-
try’s economy has been severely dam-
aged and what they will need just to 
stay afloat. 
Regarding military assistance, I am 
pleased that this past week the White 
House heeded calls from a bipartisan 
group of us to appoint a Ukraine secu-
rity assistance coordinator to cut 
through the redtape and get the right 
military assistance to Ukraine more 
quickly. 
It is important, with so many agen-
cies and individuals involved, that one 
person be solely focused on this critical 
mission and be held accountable. That 
person the White House has appointed 
is a three-star general, Terry Wolff, 
who has extensive experience as the 
former Deputy Special Presidential 
Envoy for the Global Coalition to 
Counter ISIL and has commanded 
every level from platoon to armored di-
vision. 
From the very start of this conflict, 
I have said we need to do more, and we 
need to do it more quickly. We cannot 
do that if our assistance gets bogged 
down by the bureaucracy. Every delay 
in lethal aid costs Ukrainians lives, so 
I am pleased we now have a coordi-
nator, and I hope that this will stream-
line the process. 
I am encouraged that the administra-
tion also recently announced further

assistance of $800 million in artillery 
pieces, ammunition, armored vehicles, 
and a new loitering munition called the 
Phoenix Ghost. This is a suicidal drone 
that is now in the hands of the Ukrain-
ians. That is promising. 
I understand that the $3.4 billion in 
security assistance Congress passed in 
March will soon be exhausted and that 
there will be a need for additional sup-
plemental funding for Ukraine. I en-
courage the administration to go ahead 
and look at that package, send it to us, 
get us to start thinking about it be-
cause when it comes here for a vote, I 
think we need to act quickly on it, re-
view what the administration has sent, 
and be sure we do it on a stand-alone 
basis, rather than having it get bogged 
down in unrelated legislative matters. 
I am also pleased that some State 
National Guards are sending armored 
vehicles to assist Ukraine in their ef-
forts. The Ohio National Guard will 
provide some M–113 Armored Personnel 
Carriers as part of a drawdown of DOD 
inventories to support Ukraine. This 
sends a strong message of support to 
our allies from the Buckeye State. 
I also appreciate the number of po-
lice departments across Ohio, including 
the 
Cleveland 
Police 
Department— 
where I was last week—for providing 
over 200 protective vests to Ukrainians. 
Thank you. 
Last week, I had the chance to visit 
an incredibly effective nonprofit in 
Ohio called MedWish that collects do-
nated medical supplies from hospitals 
and provides these medical supplies to 
countries that are in need—sometimes 
because of a natural disaster, in this 
case, because of war. 
Today, 
their 
major 
focus 
is 
on 
Ukraine, where they have delivered 
over 7 tons of badly needed medical 
supplies, and this effort continues. 
Again, I thank them for what they are 
doing. I thank all the hospitals and all 
the private practices that have donated 
equipment to be able to be sent to 
Ukraine to save lives. 
As we all know, this war continues to 
produce a staggering number of refu-
gees. Last week, the White House an-
nounced 
the 
program 
Uniting 
for 
Ukraine to streamline the process for 
bringing 100,000 refugees, with strong 
ties to the United States, into our 
country. Uniting for Ukraine will allow 
Americans and organizations here to 
sponsor Ukrainians who have been 
forced to leave their country. The 
American sponsors will be required to 
declare their financial support for the 
applicants, and the Ukrainians apply-
ing for this program must meet vac-
cinations and other public health re-
quirements, as well as biographic and 
biometric screening, vetting, and secu-
rity checks. 
That is all good. These individuals 
will then be allowed to work and re-
main in the United States legally for 
up to 2 years. I have heard personally 
from so many generous Ohioans who 
want to open up homes to these refu-
gees, who want to be helpful. More 
than 500 people have now called or 
emailed my office, and a number of 
businesses have expressed interest in 
offering jobs to these refugees. I urge 
the administration to quickly staff up 
this program so that we can bring some 
of these desperate refugees to the 
United States as planned. 
Unfortunately, I am finding out that 
there is no online portal yet, no way 
for people to be able to know how they 
can participate in this process. So my 
hope is that we will launch this online 
portal with applications soon so that 
folks who want to sponsor Ukrainians 
fleeing the war are able to do so. I wish 
this had been done sooner, but this is a 
step in the right direction. 
Our partners in Europe are doing 
more than their fair share here. More 
than 5 million Ukrainians have fled 
their homeland since the war began, 
and they are crossing borders into 
their neighboring countries in Europe. 
As I saw when I was in Poland last 
month meeting with refugees, Poland 
has taken in almost 3 million refugees 
alone. I think Poland is to be com-
mended with the way they have re-
sponded to this Ukrainian crisis in so 
many respects, including taking these 
refugees. 
We saw cars lined up at the refugee 
processing center, down at the border, 
of everyday Poles who were there to 
pick up Ukrainian refugees and to take 
them into their home. 
Hungary and Slovakia have taken in 
hundreds of thousands, too. Surely, the 
United States can get our act together 
with regard to the 100,000. 
I 
am 
pleased 
that 
Secretaries 
Blinken and Austin met with President 
Zelenskyy yesterday in Kyiv. This is 
the first time since the war began 2 
months ago that we have had American 
diplomats in Kyiv. I think it is impor-
tant that we are there. The Europeans 
are there, other countries are there; we 
need to be there too. 
I am glad to hear that we are finally 
reestablishing our diplomatic presence 
in Kyiv, and I am also pleased that the 
administration is finally nominating 
an ambassador to Ukraine. We have 
had no ambassador to Ukraine during 
this administration. They have indi-
cated they are going to nominate 
Bridget Brink, who is a career foreign 
service officer and is the current U.S. 
Ambassador to Slovakia; so she has 
some critical experience in the area. 
While both of these moves were long 
overdue, I commend the administration 
for finally acting—sending a strong sig-
nal to our allies and adversaries alike 
that the United States is serious about 
standing with Ukraine. 
Let’s get our diplomats back to the 
capital, back to Kyiv. Let’s get an am-
bassador in place as soon as possible. 
On the sanctions front, I believe we 
should be seizing, not just freezing, as-
sets of Kremlin supporters and provide 
the funds from the sale of these assets 
to meet the needs of Ukraine. To do 
this, I introduced with Senator BENNET 
of Colorado the Repurposing Elite Lux-
uries 
into 
Emergency 
Funds—RE-
LIEF—for Ukraine Act to require the 
Department of Justice to direct any 
funds resulting from the disposal of 
seized 
Russian 
assets 
to 
support 
Ukrainian refugees and support recon-
struction. So like other countries have 
done, including France and Germany, 
let’s seize these assets, like yachts 
owned by the Kremlin supporters or by 
President Putin himself, and then take 
those funds on the sale of those assets 
and use them immediately to help with 
the humanitarian effort. 
I urge the Senate and the House to 
act this week on this legislation so 
that we can give Ukrainians the help 
they need. 
I continue to believe our top priority 
on sanctions should be cutting off Rus-
sia’s No. 1 source of income that fuels 
the war machine. Forty to 50 percent of 
their budget is from one place—energy. 
Those receipts from energy are fueling 
the Putin war machine. Energy is Rus-
sia’s 
largest 
export 
and 
accounts, 
again, for a significant part—or of 
roughly half of their budget. 
Over the past year, the average oil 
revenues going back to Russia from 
their exports to the United States 
alone was $50 million a day. Under 
pressure from Congress, the adminis-
tration reversed course and supported 
blocking Russian oil, natural gas, and 
coal imports into the United States. I 
am glad we did that. It made no sense 
for us to help fund the Russian war ef-
fort, especially when we have our own 
resources here, in terms of energy, that 
we can access. 
I welcomed the President’s announce-
ment in Brussels of the creation of a 
joint U.S.-EU task force to help reduce 
Europe’s dependency on Russian en-
ergy and strengthen Europe’s energy 
security. Europe has become much 
more dependent on Russia for energy 
than the United States. Germany now 
gets almost 40 percent of its natural 
gas from Russia. 
This means that Europe, by the way, 
is now sending an estimated $870 mil-
lion a day to Russia—$870 million a day 
in payments for its natural gas, oil, 
and coal from Russia. Ending that Eu-
ropean reliance on Russian energy is 
the right policy, and it will save lives. 
Fortunately, again, some progress 
has been made. The EU has agreed to 
phase out imports of Russian coal over 
time. They say over the next several 
months. They have said that they are 
willing to work with the United States 
to have some of our liquefied natural 
gas, LNG, replace some of the Russian 
gas. This is a good idea. We should 
allow more production here in the 
United States so we have that LNG to 
be able to export to Germany and to 
other European countries to replace 
some of that Russian gas to make them 
less dependent on Russia and to stop 
sending this revenue to fund the war 
machine. 
Lithuania needs to be held up as the 
first European Union country to com-
pletely cut itself off from Russian nat-
ural gas.

April 25, 2022 
But the reality, again, is that Europe 
continues to fund the war machine 
right now with this $870 million every 
day in energy receipts going to Russia. 
Part of the answer, again, lies with 
us. We must support our domestic en-
ergy producers as a means of sup-
porting our national and economic se-
curity but also as a way to support our 
allies. This means America having a 
robust, all-of-the-above approach to 
power our Nation, which includes hy-
drogen, renewables, fossil fuels, carbon 
capture technologies, nuclear power, 
hydropower. The importance of this 
cannot be overstated. Energy is na-
tional security. 
As a practical matter, to stop the 
revenues going from Europe to fund the 
Russian war machine, the administra-
tion must change policies to get more 
American LNG to Europe to substitute 
for Russian gas. This requires more 
pipelines, more infrastructure, more 
export facilities, of course. 
Unfortunately, we aren’t off to a very 
good start on that front. The Presi-
dent’s tax proposals released with his 
recent budget submission to Congress 
eliminates important tax provisions 
used by our domestic producers, like 
the deduction for intangible drilling 
costs, or IDCs, which allows natural 
gas and oil producers to deduct costs 
that are necessary for the drilling in 
preparation of wells. 
Let’s take an approach here where we 
are encouraging, again, all of the above 
in order to ensure our national secu-
rity and to help our allies in Europe. 
The ruble has just about fully recov-
ered to its preinvasion value because 
Russia is still bringing in these reve-
nues from the sale of its energy. Shares 
on Russia’s stock market are trading 
again, and Russia’s VTB bank remains 
open for business in Europe, where it 
has gathered billions of euros in depos-
its, mainly from German savers. 
Our sanctions have left Russia’s big-
gest 
economic 
lifeline 
largely 
un-
touched—again, energy sales, specifi-
cally to Europe. 
In fact, in addition to cutting off the 
natural gas and the revenue that fuels 
the Russian war machine, we need to 
tighten up bank sanctions as they re-
late to energy. Sanctions for energy 
transactions 
don’t 
go 
into 
effect 
against Russian banks, including the 
VTB bank, until June 24. Those sanc-
tions ought to go into place right now. 
They should have gone into place 
weeks ago. 
President Biden must lead the alli-
ance to do what it takes to help 
Ukraine win, and the administration 
needs to make clear that their objec-
tive is for Ukraine to actually be vic-
torious, to push the forces of Russia 
out 
of 
the 
sovereign 
territory 
of 
Ukraine. 
We must remember that the Ukrain-
ians are not asking us to fight for 
them, but they are asking for the tools 
to defend themselves so they have a 
chance to win. 
I have said before that both Ukraine 
and Georgia should be given what is 
called a membership action plan as a 
next step toward NATO membership. 
Based on the actions of the Russians 
and the fighting spirit of the Ukrain-
ians, I now feel more strongly than 
ever that Ukraine should be part of 
NATO. They deserve it. 
I am encouraged that both Finland 
and Sweden are considering NATO 
membership. They should both be im-
mediately welcomed into the NATO 
family. 
Vladimir Putin sought to weaken the 
NATO alliance. This is yet another 
strategic failure on his part, as we are 
coming closer together and will poten-
tially add even more members. 
I will close with this thought: Some 
might ask—even a few of my colleagues 
have asked me—why a Senator from 
Ohio cares about what goes on in 
Ukraine. 
Well, the first answer is, we should 
all care. This is about the fight for 
freedom in our time, in our generation. 
This is where it is being engaged right 
now. 
I also happen to have tens of thou-
sands of Ukrainians who call Ohio 
home. These Ukrainian-Americans are 
good friends of mine. They are con-
stituents. They keep me informed and 
have over the years. They have helped 
me to get more engaged on this issue. 
I have been to Ukraine six or seven 
times. When I was at the border of 
Ukraine and Poland last month, some 
of my Ohio friends were there too as 
volunteers, providing food and medical 
supplies to the refugees. 
When Ukraine made a decision to 
turn to us, to turn to democracy and 
freedom and free enterprise back in 
2014, I was there with my colleague BEN 
CARDIN, a Democrat from Maryland. 
We were there as election observers, 
but what we really observed was a 
country that had made a decision to 
turn to us, to turn to the West, to be 
like us, to join us in the fight for free-
dom. 
Even if I had no constituents of 
Ukrainian descent, I would be standing 
here because this is the fight for free-
dom. This is our test. Are we going to 
be stand against tyranny and for free-
dom at a time when these terrible 
atrocities are being committed? 
I have been to the border of Ukraine 
and Poland and talked to these refu-
gees. Through their tears, they spoke 
of their apartments or homes being de-
stroyed and damaged. They talked of 
friends and family members being in-
jured or killed. They talked of the pain 
of being separated from their husbands 
or fathers, not knowing their fate, 
since they had stayed behind to fight. 
They also begged us to put in place a 
no-fly zone to help them even more. 
The popular Ukrainian national ral-
lying cry ‘‘Slava Ukraini’’ when trans-
lated 
into 
English 
is 
‘‘Glory 
to 
Ukraine.’’ And then the response to 
that 
is 
‘‘Glory 
to 
the 
heroes.’’ 
‘‘Heroyam Slava.’’ 
In the midst of all this, there are so 
many heroes to glorify in Ukraine—he-
roes like the people I saw in Ohio last 
week who work at MedWish and are 
providing medical supplies urgently 
needed in Ukraine; the staff that col-
lect and send these much-needed sup-
plies, going mostly to the women and 
children of Ukraine who continue to 
seek safe passage in their homeland. 
Not only are there heroes here, but 
there are so many heroes at home in 
Ukraine. Those are the firefighters. 
Those are the soldiers. Those are the 
citizen soldiers. 
With our help, the Ukrainians can 
win this war. 
One of the members of Parliament 
from Ukraine, from the Rada, who 
came to see us a few weeks ago here in 
Congress, perhaps said it best. We met 
with the Ukrainian Caucus that I co- 
chair, and we had four members of the 
Rada come, all women; and the Ambas-
sador from Ukraine was there as well. 
She said she hears all the time that, 
‘‘We are all Ukrainians now,’’ and I 
have heard that back home, and that is 
how I feel. 
She said that if that is true, since we 
are all Ukrainians now, we must be 
like Ukrainians. She said, ‘‘We must be 
brave, creative, and fast.’’ And that is 
what they are. 
They are very resourceful. They have 
figured out a way to take on one of the 
biggest armies in the world and be suc-
cessful, brave, creative, and fast. 
I urge my colleagues, the administra-
tion, and the world: Let us help 
Ukraine win this war by being brave, 
creative, and fast. By doing that, we 
will show the world America stands 
with Ukraine, which is in our national 
security interest. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
the other Senator from Ohio, Senator 
PORTMAN, for his work in Ukraine. I 
was with the Ukrainian group over the 
last week or so and talked about the 
work Senator PORTMAN has done. And 
we also talked about how Putin has 
just been shocked by the passion and 
the effectiveness and the strength and 
the courage of the Ukrainian opposi-
tion, surely, and also Putin has been 
shocked by President Biden’s skill at 
putting together this coalition in oppo-
sition to the Russians. 
Germany, who hadn’t really played 
in an exercise like this, in an action 
like this in decades, and Sweden and 
Finland 
and 
Switzerland—countries 
that simply were neutral. And I appre-
ciate Senator PORTMAN’s work on that 
and the President of the United States, 
and it is why we are doing a reasonably 
good job as a world, as a world commu-
nity, in helping with refugees who have 
gone to Poland and Moldova and other 
areas while we are getting arms to 
them, while we are doing damage to 
the Russian economy and will continue 
to do that. So I thank my friend from 
Cincinnati. 
NOMINATIONS OF LAEL BRAINARD AND LISA 
DENELL COOK

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2124 
April 25, 2022 
nominations of Lael Brainard to be 
Vice Chairman of the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System 
and Lisa Cook to be a Member of the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve. 
Dr. Brainard and Dr. Cook are highly 
qualified economists with decades of 
experience, having provided exemplary 
service to their profession and to this 
country. 
Since 2014, Dr. Brainard has served as 
a Member of the Board of Governors to 
the Federal Reserve. She has helped 
oversee the Fed’s important financial 
stability work. She has worked to cre-
ate a better payment system that 
works for consumers and for small 
banks. 
Prior to serving on the Fed, Dr. 
Brainard was Under Secretary for 
International 
Affairs 
at 
Treasury, 
where she played a critical role in help-
ing support our country’s recovery 
from the Wall Street-induced financial 
crisis in 2008. 
She has a long history of bipartisan 
support 
and 
bipartisan 
work. 
She 
served in administrations of both par-
ties. She was Deputy National Eco-
nomic Adviser in the Clinton adminis-
tration. She was a staff economist at 
the Council of Economic Advisers dur-
ing the first George Bush administra-
tion. 
And in between her public service to 
our country, she served as a professor 
of applied economics at one of the na-
tion’s great institutions, the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology. 
Throughout this distinguished ca-
reer, Dr. Brainard has been not just a 
good economist, but she has been a per-
sistent advocate for working families 
and for communities who have been 
left on their own for too long. 
She understands the role of govern-
ment and the role of the Federal Re-
serve should be—it is not always suc-
cessful in getting them there; I think 
these new nominees will do that—put-
ting workers at the center of our econ-
omy and putting the workers at the 
center of our financial regulatory sys-
tem, and putting workers at the center 
of what we do here. 
She led the way at modernizing and 
strengthening the Community Rein-
vestment Act, a landmark civil rights 
law passed to begin undoing the legacy 
of redlining and lending discrimina-
tion, spurring investments in neighbor-
hoods and communities. The CRA has 
fallen short many times, partly be-
cause of the last administration and 
the damage it did, but we are breathing 
new life into the CRA. Dr. Lael 
Brainard has done a good job in keep-
ing it alive and setting the stage. 
She led decisive, bipartisan action to 
use the Fed’s emergency lending and 
monetary policy tools to support fami-
lies through the COVID–19 crisis. 
Like Dr. Brainard, Dr. Cook is a lead-
ing economist with years of research 
and international experience in mone-
tary policy, banking, and financial cri-
ses. She knows that workers drive our 
economic growth. She knows how im-
portant their local communities are. 
Dr. Cook spent her formative years 
in 
the 
South, 
growing 
up 
in 
Milledgeville, GA. She spent a signifi-
cant portion of her career in the indus-
trial Midwest. She has seen how eco-
nomic policy set here and economic 
policy set at the Federal Reserve affect 
all kinds of different people in different 
parts of the country. 
She graduated from Spelman College, 
one of the great institutions in this 
country. She was a Marshall scholar 
and a Truman scholar. Whom do we 
know that are both of those things? 
And she chose both, very exclusive 
honors and academic disciplines. She 
studied 
at 
Oxford 
University. 
She 
earned a Ph.D. in economics, again, 
from one of our great institutions in 
this country, the University of Cali-
fornia Berkeley. 
She is a tenured professor of econom-
ics and international relations at one 
of the great institutions in my part of 
the country, Michigan State Univer-
sity. She taught at the Harvard Ken-
nedy School of Government. She served 
on the Council of Economic Advisers 
during the eurozone crisis and at the 
Department of Treasury. 
Yet—yet—Mr. President, despite her 
extensive experience, despite her broad 
support, a small but really, really loud 
minority, far outside the mainstream, 
have engaged in a smear campaign 
against Dr. Cook. It is emblematic of 
the sorts of attacks that Black and 
Brown Americans, particularly women, 
have encountered for far too long here. 
I won’t go through what has hap-
pened in my committee. I chair the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs. I won’t lay out—for one 
thing, the Senators on my side of the 
aisle know it, and the Senators on 
their side of the aisle don’t want to 
think about it—what has happened 
with very, very qualified, accomplished 
Black women coming out of my com-
mittee and how few Republicans have 
voted for them. Counting one after an-
other, they get zero votes or 1 vote or 
2 votes out of 12. 
Women, and certainly Black women, 
know all too well what it is like to be 
called ‘‘inexperienced’’ when you are 
anything but. They know what it is 
like to be told that your qualifications 
are never enough, no matter how ex-
tensive they are, no matter how im-
pressive they are. 
These naysayers wrongly claim that 
Lisa Cook doesn’t meet the standards 
for this position—standards that only 
seem to apply for certain nominees. 
Like the game of Whac-A-Mole, each 
time these assertions and allegations 
are rebutted—and each time they are 
effectively 
rebutted—a 
new, 
more 
untethered one arises. 
She is unquestionably qualified. Dr. 
Lisa Cook is unquestionably qualified. 
If confirmed, she would be the first 
Black woman ever in the 100-plus year 
history of the Fed to serve on the 
Board. Think of that. In 1913, the Fed 
started, and 109 years later, seven peo-
ple—not one person on the Fed, not one 
Chair; seven people on the Fed, most 
times—but with seven spots on the 
Fed, she will be the first Black woman 
ever in 109 years. Think about that. 
Dr. Cook and Dr. Brainard will be ex-
cellent additions to the Fed. We need 
them on the job now. As Americans 
face rising prices caused by corporate 
greed and the global pandemic and 
Putin’s war, having a full Board has 
never been more vital than now. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
Dr. Lael Brainard and Dr. Lisa Cook— 
their nominations—so they can get to 
work for the American people. 
I yield the floor.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, sec-
tion 36(b) of the Arms Export Control 
Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Argentina—T–6 Aircraft Sustainment 
The Government of Argentina has re-
quested to buy follow-on sustainment and 
support of their T–6 Texan aircraft fleet, to 
include the following aircraft hardware and 
software modifications and support: major 
and minor modifications include airframe 
and avionics improvements for reliability 
and integration of training munitions and 
external fuel tanks; aircraft and engine sup-
port equipment, components, consumables, 
spare parts and repair/return; publications 
and technical documentation; heavy mainte-
nance support; other U.S. Government and 
contractor 
engineering, 
technical, 
and 
logistical support services, and related ele-
ments of program support. The estimated 
total cost is $73 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a major Non-NATO ally that is a 
force for political stability and economic 
progress in South America. It is in the U.S. 
national interest to assist Argentina in de-
veloping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
The proposed renewal of T–6 aircraft sup-
port will provide the Government of Argen-
tina with the capability to meet current and 
future threats by revitalizing Argentina’s 
trainer aircraft capabilities and to aid in the 
overall development of a professional pilot 
corps. Argentina is committed to modern-
izing its military and will have no difficulty 
absorbing the additional sustainment into 
its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Textron 
Aviation Defense, Wichita, KS. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale may 
require the assignment of additional U.S. 
Government and/or U.S. contractor rep-
resentatives to Argentina to support pro-
gram and financial management reviews. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

System Joint Tactical Radio Systems 
The Government of Australia has re-
quested to buy one hundred six (106) Multi-
functional Information Distribution System 
Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS) 
(5) terminals; fifteen (15) MIDS JTRS (6) ter-
minals; and seven (7) Multifunctional Infor-
mation Distribution System MIDS-Low Vol-
ume Terminal (MIDS–LVT) (4) Block Up-
grade Two (BU2) retrofit kits. Also included 
are Low Volume Terminal (LVT) Cryp-
tographic Modules (LCM). The estimated 
total value is $42 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
The proposed sale will improve Australia’s 
capability to interoperate with U.S. forces 
and exchange secure, jam-resistant tactical 
data via Link 16. Australia will use the en-
hanced capability as a deterrent to regional 
threats and strengthen its homeland defense. 
Australia will have no difficulty absorbing 
this equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be Viasat, 
Carlsbad, CA; and Data Link Solutions, 
Cedar Rapids, IA. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
potential sale. 
Implementation of the proposed sale may 
require U.S. Government and contractor per-
sonnel to visit Australia on a temporary 
basis in conjunction with program technical 
oversight and support requirements, includ-
ing program and technical reviews. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

matically expand the number of platforms 
and network-enabled systems that can be re-
liably included in a Link 16 network. These 
enhancements allow a single MIDS JTRS 
terminal to simultaneously receive messages 
on up to four nets, compared with on a single 
net in terminals without CMN and CCR, 
within a single Link 16 time slot, allowing a 
user to ‘‘hear’’ messages from up to three ad-
ditional sources at once. Tactical Targeting 
Network Technology (TTNT) is built into 
some MIDS JTRS terminals that adds an ad-
ditional advanced capability waveform.

MEMORANDUM
OF
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
THE 
EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF THE SALE OF 
NON-STANDARD
AMMUNITION
TO
UKRAINE 
UNDER SECTION 36(b)(1) OF THE ARMS EXPORT 
CONTROL ACT 
The Secretary of State has executed his 
delegated authority to determine that an 
emergency exists requiring the sale of non- 
standard ammunition to the Government of 
Ukraine in the national security interest of 
the 
United 
States 
and 
the 
immediate 
issuance of the associated letter of offer. 
In the early morning of February 24, Rus-
sia launched a full-scale, premeditated at-
tack against Ukraine. Russia’s massive mili-
tary force buildup (with over 150,000 soldiers 
and equipment along the Russia-Ukraine and 
Belarus-Ukraine borders) enabled it to in-
vade Ukraine with devastating consequences. 
This incursion came after Russia’s cyber op-
erations attacks against Ukrainian govern-
ment 
infrastructure, 
Russian 
President 
Putin’s purported recognition on February 21 
of the so-called ‘‘Luhansk People’s Repub-
lic’’ and ‘‘Donetsk People’s Republic’’ as 
independent states, and the Kremlin’s subse-
quent deployment of Russian military forces 
into the Donbas. On February 24, President 
Putin announced a ‘‘special military oper-
ation’’ in Ukraine, and Russian forces 
launched premediated, unprovoked, and un-
justified attacks against locations through-
out Ukraine, including civilian infrastruc-
ture, in a full-scale invasion. 
Over the last eight years, the U.S. govern-
ment has provided robust levels of defense 
support to Ukraine to help counter Russia’s 
aggressive 
and 
destabilizing 
activities. 
Ukraine also has increasingly purchased U.S. 
military equipment using national funds. 
Since the beginning of the conflict in 2014, 
the United States has provided more than $6 
billion in security assistance to Ukraine, in-
cluding through the Department of Defense’s 
(DoD) Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative 
(USAI), DoD’s security assistance authority 
under 10 U.S.C. 333, State’s foreign military 
financing (FMF) program, and presidential 
drawdowns. Through these programs, which 
accelerated in the immediate lead-up to and 
following the February 24 all-out Russian at-
tack, the United States has provided and is 
providing Ukraine with military equipment 
such as anti-armor missile systems, man- 
portable air defense systems, unmanned aer-
ial systems, patrol boats, helicopters, artil-
lery, grenade launchers, counter-artillery 
and counter-mortar radars, military medical 
equipment, electronic warfare detection sys-
tems, tactical gear, ammunition, and sup-
port for ongoing training programs. 
Although U.S. security assistance has im-
proved Ukraine’s overall defense posture and 
capabilities, Ukraine’s military forces re-
quire urgent additional support to enable 
them to continue to defend against the ongo-
ing Russian invasion. There is an urgent and 
pressing need to provide nonstandard ammu-
nition to Ukraine’s military forces, which is 
essential to enable those forces to repel Rus-
sian advances into their territory—particu-
larly a renewed offensive in the east and 
south. As Ukrainian forces expend ammuni-
tion to defend their country, their daily re-
plenishment requirements continue to in-
crease. With critically low stores of ammuni-
tion for their fielded systems, we must act 
immediately to provide the required ammu-
nition to sustain Ukraine in this conflict. 
The sale of this ammunition is expected to 
be funded from FMF for Ukraine. 
For the reasons discussed above, an emer-
gency exists which requires this sale under 
the Arms Export Control Act, in the na-
tional security interest of the United States 
and the immediate issuance of the associated 
letter of offer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2128 
April 25, 2022 
*As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Ex-
port Control Act. 
POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Ukraine—Non-Standard Ammunition 
The Government of Ukraine has requested 
to buy various rounds of non-standard am-
munition to include, but not limited to, the 
following: 152mm rounds for 2A36 Giatsint; 
152mm rounds for D–20 cannons; VOG–17 for 
automatic grenade launcher AGS–17; 120mm 
mortar rounds (non-NATO); 122mm rounds 
for 2Sl Gvozdika; BM–21 GRAD Rockets; 
300mm rounds/rockets for MLRS ‘‘Smerch;’’ 
VOG–25 grenades for under barrel grenade 
launcher GP–25; 82mm mortar rounds; 125mm 
HE ammunition for T–72; 152mm rounds for 
2A65 Msta; transportation; and other related 
elements of logistical and program support. 
The total estimated program cost is $165 mil-
lion. 
The Secretary of State has determined and 
provided detailed justification that an emer-
gency exists that requires the immediate 
sale to Ukraine of the above defense articles 
(and defense services) in the national secu-
rity interests of the United States, thereby 
waiving the Congressional review require-
ments under Section 36(b) of the Arms Ex-
port Control Act, as amended. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a partner country that is a force for 
political stability and economic progress in 
Europe. 
The proposed sale will improve Ukraine’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by maintaining the operational read-
iness of its forces. The provision of non- 
standard and legacy Warsaw Pact ammuni-
tion will enable the Armed Forces Ukraine 
to defend itself against ongoing threats and 
enhance national defense. Ukraine already 
has these items, or variants thereof, in its 
inventory and will have no difficulty absorb-
ing this equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor(s) will be selected 
upon contract award. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Ukraine. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

TRIBUTE TO THEODORE ‘‘TED’’ 
BORNSTEIN 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor my friend, Theodore 
‘‘Ted’’ Bornstein. Ted recently an-
nounced his well-deserved retirement, 
after a long career as a vital and vig-
orous public servant and advocate. 
In the late 1970s, Ted began his work 
in Washington, DC, establishing and 
overseeing the State of Missouri’s DC 
office, and led it for more than 6 years 
on behalf of Governors Joe Teasdale 
and Kit Bond. He later shifted to the 
U.S. House of Representatives, serving 
as chief of staff to Representatives 
Cecil Heftel and Les Aspin. After Rep-
resentative Aspin’s confirmation to be 
Secretary of Defense under then-Presi-
dent Bill Clinton, Ted served as the di-
rector of the Defense Reinvestment 
Task Force. 
Following his time in the Depart-
ment of Defense, Ted returned to Cap-
itol Hill to serve the people of Wis-
consin as chief of staff for former Sen-
ator Herb Kohl. As Senator Kohl’s 
chief of staff, he led legislative out-
reach strategies and programs and 
oversaw the operation of several offices 
of more than 40 staff. He later departed 
Senator Kohl’s office and joined the 
firm of Foley & Lardner, LLP, where 
he will retire as a partner this year. 
Ted’s experience on Capitol Hill and 
the executive branch have made him a 
valuable asset to clients across a wide 
breadth of interests. He has success-
fully assisted clients in areas ranging 
from congressional investigations to 
defense policy and appropriations, as 
well as tax policy, healthcare, and gov-
ernmental ethics. 
Outside of his professional work, Ted 
is a cofounder of the influential Wis-
consin Group. This group brings to-
gether 
Wisconsin–connected 
profes-
sionals in business and public policy to 
meet regularly on issues of importance. 
His efforts on this front have been in-
valuable to many bipartisan achieve-
ments of the Wisconsin congressional 
delegation. 
I am pleased to recognize Ted’s long 
career in public service and advocacy, 
and I wish him all the best in his re-
tirement.

REMEMBERING R. RICHARD 
‘‘DICK’’ WAGNER 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today 
I rise to honor someone who was a true 
leader and inspiring figure to many in 
my hometown of Madison, WI, and 
across our country. 
Scholar 
and 
activist 
R. 
Richard 
‘‘Dick’’ Wagner sadly passed away on 
December 13, 2021, at the age of 78. 
Dick devoted his life to public service 
and advancing our common good. In 
1980, he was elected as the first openly 
gay member of the Dane County Board 
of Supervisors, where he served for 14 
years, including 4 years as chair. 
I first met Dick in 1984. Fresh out of 
college and looking to connect with the 
local political scene, I was invited to a 
gathering of local progressive elected 
officials, labor union leaders, and civil 
rights and environmental activists to 
strategize about candidate recruitment 
for city council and school board seats 
to be contested in the spring elections. 
We met on the second floor of a popular 
local 
establishment, 
Mother’s 
Pub, 
which had long been a gathering spot 
for local progressives. I observed how 
much respect Dick had earned from his 
fellow progressive leaders. Following a 
discussion about the issues the group 
hoped to advance, we broke into small 
groups. Dick Wagner led a discussion 
on opportunities to advance policies, 
initiatives, and ordinances to counter 
discrimination against our community. 
That day, Dick became my role model 
and mentor, and a lifelong friendship 
ensued. 
As one of the first dozen openly gay 
officials in the Nation, Dick was a 
founding member of the International 
Network of Lesbian and Gay Officials, 
now known as the Victory Institute. 
With quiet determination and the ut-
most civility, he provided me and 
many others a path forward. Together, 
Dick and I cohosted the fifth Victory 
Institute conference in Madison in 1989. 
Dick had an expansive professional 
career in public service, serving on the 
Wisconsin Arts Board, the Wisconsin 
Humanities Committee, the National 
Board for the Assembly of State Arts 
Agencies, 
the 
Madison 
Landmarks 
Commission, Olbrich Botanical Soci-
ety, Friends of UW Libraries, and the 
Governor’s Council on Lesbian and Gay 
Issues. 
He 
also 
cofounded 
UW-Madison’s 
LGBT Alumni Association; and the 
New Harvest Foundation, the LGBT 
foundation 
for 
south-central 
Wis-
consin, and served on the board of Fair 
Wisconsin. 
Dick understood that change grows 
at local grassroots level, and he worked 
hard in a collaborative way to bring it 
to Wisconsin. His work as a leader in 
the gay community helped lead to a 
city gay rights ordinance in 1974 and a 
county ordinance in 1980 prohibiting 
discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation. He was also instrumental 
in establishing some of the State’s first 
antidiscrimination laws against gays 
and lesbians. 
In retirement, he fully utilized his 
doctorate in history by authoring two 
groundbreaking volumes on gay his-
tory in Wisconsin: ‘‘We’ve Been Here 
All Along’’ provided an illuminating 
picture of Wisconsin’s gay history from 
the reporting on the Oscar Wilde trials 
of 1895 to the landmark Stonewall 
Riots of 1969. ‘‘Coming Out, Moving 
Forward: Wisconsin’s Recent Gay His-
tory’’ outlined the challenges that 
LGBTQ Wisconsinites faced in their ef-
forts to right past oppressions and se-
cure equality. It also powerfully told 
the stories of our State’s LGBTQ pio-
neers who pushed back against injus-
tice and found ways to live openly and 
proudly as themselves. 
Dick Wagner was a deeply inspiring 
person in my life as a role model, men-
tor, and lifelong friend. In fact, I may 
not have ever entered public service if 
not for the guidance and encourage-
ment he provided me to walk the path 
he paved. He provided the opportunity 
for young people like myself and others 
growing up all over Wisconsin to know 
that they are not alone and that they 
stand on the shoulders of people who 
came before them. Dick lived a life 
that showed to all of us that history 
only moves in one direction: Forward. 
For that, I am forever grateful.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2129 
April 25, 2022 
named the National State Trooper of 
the Year by the International Associa-
tion of Chiefs of Police, State, and Pro-
vincial 
Division. 
Morris 
has 
dem-
onstrated his dedication to serving his 
community, and this high honor is cer-
tainly hard earned and well deserved. 
Hailing 
from 
Crittenden 
County, 
Trooper Morris graduated from the Ar-
kansas State Police Training Academy 
in 2018 and began his career serving and 
protecting his neighbors and fellow Ar-
kansans. As with all law enforcement 
positions, this role comes with consid-
erable risk and uncertainty, which he 
understood and agreed to step into for 
the sake of public service. 
Morris has shown his commitment to 
the people of Arkansas each day he 
puts on his badge and uniform, but ex-
hibited incredible bravery on December 
16, 2021, during an attempted traffic 
stop. While on patrol, Morris answered 
the radio call from the U.S. Marshals 
Service requesting assistance in the ap-
prehension of a wanted fugitive be-
lieved to be armed and dangerous. Mor-
ris sprang into action and attempted to 
pull the suspect’s vehicle over when he 
sustained a shot in the chest. After re-
turning fire and calling for backup, the 
suspect was successfully apprehended. 
Colonel Bill Bryant, director of the 
Arkansas State Police, said of Morris’ 
heroism, ‘‘Trooper Spencer Morris is 
just one example of more than 500 
other Arkansas state troopers, just 
like him, who set aside awesome risks 
to themselves each day to make their 
state a safer and better place to call 
home.’’ 
I am extremely thankful for Trooper 
Morris and his colleagues who patrol 
our State highways and serve Natural 
State citizens each and every day. It is 
because of their dedication and bravery 
we are able to travel across our beau-
tiful State and feel safe on our roads, 
highways, and beyond. 
Congratulations to Trooper Spencer 
Morris on this distinguished and pres-
tigious honor. He represents the best of 
his community, his brothers and sis-
ters in law enforcement, and our won-
derful State. We are tremendously 
proud of him and celebrate this mile-
stone in his career and protecting the 
Natural State.∑

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
BUFFALO NATIONAL RIVER 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to celebrate the Buffalo National 
River as we mark the 50th year since it 
was designated as our country’s first 
National River. Enjoying wildlife and 
the outdoors is a way of life for resi-
dents of the Natural State, and the 
Buffalo National River has helped 
countless Arkansans do just that. 
Congress formally afforded the Buf-
falo River Federal protection on March 
1, 1972, to preserve its 135 miles of free- 
flowing river and conserve natural, sce-
nic and scientific features like the deep 
valleys, towering bluffs, rugged wilder-
ness, and beautiful landscapes of the 
Ozark Mountains. That act has helped 
safeguard one of Arkansas’ most prized 
gems for five decades. 
This was the result of the leadership 
and vision of Congressman John Paul 
Hammerschmidt, the longtime rep-
resentative of the Third Congressional 
District. Using his position on the 
House Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee, he helped protect the 
Buffalo River under the designation as 
a national river. 
This incredible attraction welcomes 
Arkansans and travelers from all over 
the world, to take in the State’s nat-
ural beauty. 
From Big Bluff and Hawksbill Crag, 
to its famous herd of elk, images of the 
area are instantly recognizable. 
The Buffalo National River provides 
something for everyone. Outdoor en-
thusiasts come to enjoy the excitement 
of the river, take in the beauty and se-
renity of the surrounding wilderness, 
and experience the friendliness of the 
Arkansas community. This unique, 
natural treasure has also been a steady 
source of economic growth and a staple 
of our tourism industry for years. Help-
ing to grow businesses and commu-
nities, the Buffalo National River has 
contributed to the betterment of Ar-
kansas in countless ways. 
I am so thankful for all the men and 
women who have worked over the years 
to make this park what it is today and 
helped maintain it for all Arkansans to 
enjoy. It is because of these dedicated 
individuals and organizations that fu-
ture generations will be able to experi-
ence the river’s beauty and inviting at-
mosphere just as we do today. 
In celebration of this historic mile-
stone, an incredible group of park and 
community workers and volunteers has 
planned some great events throughout 
the year, and I am excited to follow 
along. Congratulations to all those, 
past and present, who have helped con-
serve and protect this iconic natural 
resource that has helped define and dif-
ferentiate Arkansas for the last 50 
years and many more into the future.∑

TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE ‘‘KAT’’ 
MILLER 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I want to take a moment to recognize 
and thank COL Katherine ‘‘Kat’’ Miller 
for her years of service to the people of 
Nevada. She leaves behind a powerful 
legacy of public service and dedication 
to our military and Nevada’s veterans. 
Kat Miller grew up in Reno, NV, and 
after 
graduating 
from 
Reno 
High 
School embarked on a 34-year career in 
the Army and Nevada National Guard. 
Among her many contributions to our 
Nation’s Armed Forces are her service 
on four continents and deployments to 
Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Kat was something of a trailblazer 
serving in multiple leadership posi-
tions and commanding thousands of 
staff as a military police brigade com-
mander in the U.S. and Afghanistan 
and as the commander of the Depart-
ment of Defense’s largest correctional 
organization. After retirement from 
the Army, she taught at the University 
of Maryland and the University of Ne-
vada, Reno before becoming the direc-
tor of the Nevada Department of Vet-
erans Services—NDVS—in 2013. 
Nevada 
has 
benefited 
immensely 
from Kat’s directorship of the NDVS. 
Under her watch, the NDVS made huge 
strides for our State’s veterans. Nota-
bly, NDVS assisted the Governor and 
Nevada mayors in their efforts to re-
duce suicide among veterans and their 
families, created nine programs to sup-
port unique or at-risk veteran popu-
lations, trained hundreds of healthcare 
providers in understanding how demen-
tia and the aging process affect the 
care of veterans, and created a program 
to help employers recruit and retain 
veterans. 
Kat also successfully led the NDVS 
in applying for over $70 million in Fed-
eral grants for veterans’ programs, in-
cluding for nursing home creation and 
improvements, cemetery expansions, 
disabled 
veterans 
sports 
programs, 
rural transportation initiatives, and 
telehealth equipment. Under Kat’s di-
rectorship, the NDVS received five na-
tional awards for these innovative vet-
erans support programs: the Nevada 
Veterans Advocate Program, the Ne-
vada Veterans Legislative Program, 
the ‘‘Ask a VSO’’ Program, Operation 
Mission Ready, and the Patriot Em-
ployer 
Program. 
Furthermore, 
last 
year, Kat was appointed to the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Veterans 
Rural Health Advisory Committee to 
help identify barriers to access to 
healthcare in rural areas and rec-
ommend solutions to the Veterans Af-
fairs secretary. 
The list of Kat’s achievements and 
contributions to the State of Nevada 
and the U.S. Army goes on and on. I 
have no doubt that Kat’s legacy of 
service will continue to leave a power-
ful impact on the lives of many vet-
erans in Nevada for years to come. She 
has my deep thanks.∑

REMEMBERING JOHN DISTASO 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today 
to 
join 
Granite 
Staters 
in 
mourning the loss of John DiStaso, 
whose tenacious, in-depth, and effec-
tive political reporting reflected—and 
was a tribute to—New Hampshire’s 
independent, skeptical, and engaged 
political culture. 
John got his start in our State as a 
correspondent for the New Hampshire 
Union Leader. Beginning as a staff re-
porter in 1980, John rose to spend many 
years as the senior political reporter at 
the Union Leader, becoming an expert 
on the most pressing issues facing New 
Hampshire and the political campaigns 
that help define the Granite State and 
the Nation. Ending his tenure at the 
Union Leader in 2014, John later took 
his talents to WMUR, where he helped 
lead the station’s political coverage. 
For any of us who were the subject of 
his reporting, it was always clear that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2130 
April 25, 2022 
John loved what he did and deeply be-
lieved in the importance of journalism 
to our democracy. He asked tough 
questions, he chased scoops, and he 
brought a Granite State lens to every-
thing he wrote. Politics wasn’t a game 
to him, and he took seriously his role 
of bringing political news directly to 
the voters. 
John is perhaps best known for set-
ting the standard for first in the Na-
tion primary coverage, chronicling our 
primary for decades. First and fore-
most, Granite Staters turned to him to 
get everything that they needed to 
know as they grilled candidates at 
townhalls, and made their choices at 
the ballot box. And John was surely on 
speed dial for countless national polit-
ical reporters who relied on him for his 
insights and analysis on our unique and 
historic primary, because no one knew 
the first in the Nation primary better 
than John. 
Day in and day out, John tirelessly 
reported the news, ensuring that Gran-
ite Staters always knew the latest, not 
only on elections but also on critical 
issues facing our State, like the sub-
stance misuse epidemic. No story was 
too big or too small for John. Through-
out his 40–year career in the Granite 
State, 
he 
interviewed 
four 
sitting 
Presidents, as well as countless New 
Hampshire elected officials and na-
tional leaders. 
The impact of this coverage extended 
far beyond the page or the screen. 
Granite Staters are some of the most 
informed and engaged voters in the 
country, and that is in no small part 
due to John’s deep commitment to 
sharing New Hampshire political news 
directly with the people. His passion 
for reporting helped fuel the Granite 
State practice of deeply engaged cit-
izen participation in democracy. 
John’s love of journalism, his under-
standing of its importance to nurturing 
and protecting, our democracy, and his 
commitment to getting it right reflect 
the very best of New Hampshire—even 
if he was a Yankees fan. He will be 
missed.∑

TRIBUTE TO MARCINE D. GOODLOE 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to pay tribute to a constituent, a 
trailblazer, a pillar of the Montgomery 
County community, a neighbor, and a 
dear friend: Ms. Marcine D. Goodloe. 
Ms. Goodloe has spent over 40 years ad-
vocating for the interests of volunteer 
firefighters and first responders across 
Maryland. She has been a special 
champion for Montgomery County, the 
place where I raised my family and 
where I still live. It is my honor to rec-
ognize her extraordinary life and dedi-
cation to our community and to the 
safety of all Americans. 
Marcine D. Goodloe has made service 
her mission. She began her career as 
the 
executive 
secretary 
for 
Mont-
gomery County Fire and Rescue Serv-
ices and later served as executive di-
rector for the Montgomery County Fire 
and Rescue Commission. Over the 
years, Ms. Goodloe’s commitment to 
community service moved her up the 
fire-rescue ranks. At the height of her 
career, she oversaw the operations of 19 
local volunteer fire and rescue depart-
ments and more than 2,400 fire, rescue, 
EMS, administrative, and auxiliary 
members serving over 1 million Mont-
gomery County residents. 
Following years of exemplary serv-
ice, Ms. Goodloe made history as the 
first woman elected president of the 
Montgomery County Volunteer Fire- 
Rescue Association in its century-long 
history. 
Her 
distinguished 
tenure 
lasted 16 years. As president, Ms. 
Goodloe worked tirelessly to advance 
the priorities of the entire association 
family. She partnered with community 
leaders at all levels of government— 
from the county council to the U.S. 
Congress—and delivered real results. 
At the local level, she successfully ad-
vocated for innovative policy solutions 
that helped strengthen physical stand-
ards, first responder training, and drug 
and alcohol testing. She raised the con-
cerns of the Montgomery County vol-
unteer fire-rescue community in Wash-
ington D.C. too, working with Members 
of Congress to secure Federal resources 
for first responders. Ms. Goodloe’s com-
mitment to service also reached be-
yond my State. In 2005, she raised more 
than $20,000 for a fire department in 
Mississippi that was damaged by Hurri-
cane Katrina. Ms. Goodloe has been a 
vocal ambassador for first responders 
everywhere, and her leadership has 
been nothing short of inspiring. 
Throughout her decades of service, 
Ms. Goodloe has always brought dig-
nity, strength, and kindness to her 
work. She has toiled in the trenches, 
working day-in and day-out to ensure 
that the men and women who stand 
guard over our communities get the 
support they need to do the job and 
come home safe. Ms. Goodloe has not 
only served her community honorably, 
but she has also empowered women 
across the Nation to enter a career in 
fire service. Her legacy of good works 
have earned her numerous accolades 
including the Mason Fire Lankford 
Fire Service Leadership Award, the 
Chief Leslie B. Johnson Community 
Service Award, and a spot in the Mary-
land State Firemen Association’s Hall 
of Fame. On a personal note, I always 
look forward to meeting with Marcine 
on her visits to Capitol Hill to cham-
pion Federal programs that support all 
firefighters. She always did her home-
work. No one could say no to Marcine. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in ex-
tending our deepest gratitude to my 
friend Marcine Goodloe for her out-
standing service to Maryland’s Volun-
teer Fire and Rescue Service and in 
recognition of all she has done to keep 
our communities and our first respond-
ers safe.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 4080. A bill to modify the boundary 
of the Berryessa Snow Mountain Na-
tional Monument to include certain 
Federal land in Lake County, Cali-
fornia, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Berryessa Snow Moun-
tain National Monument Expansion 
Act. 
This legislation would expand the 
Berryessa Snow Mountain National 
Monument to include approximately 
3,925 acres of adjacent public land man-
aged by the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment. 
In 2015, President Obama established 
the Berryessa Snow Mountain National 
Monument, proclaiming that ‘‘once 
covered by ocean waters, it is a land-
scape shaped by geologic forces of stag-
gering power overlain with bountiful 
but fragile biodiversity. Anchored in 
the north by Snow Mountain’s remote 
forests and in the south by scenic 
Berryessa 
Mountain, 
this 
area 
stretches through unbroken wildlands 
and important wildlife corridors, a mo-
saic of native grasslands, picturesque 
oak woodlands, rare wetlands, and wild 
chaparral . . . This dramatic and di-
verse landscape is a biological hotspot 
providing refuge for rare plant and ani-
mal species and showcasing the human 
history of north-central California.’’ 
The Berryessa Snow Mountain Na-
tional Monument is managed jointly 
by the Bureau of Land Management, 
BLM, and the U.S. Forest Service, 
USFS and provides for unparalleled 
outdoor recreational opportunities, is 
home to rich biodiversity, and contains 
lands that are culturally significant to 
over two dozen federally recognized 
tribes. This legislation would add over 
3,900 acres of adjacent, BLM-adminis-
tered land to the existing national 
monument. 
This expansion would include por-
tions of the land known previously as 
Walker Ridge in Lake County, CA. Im-
portantly, 
the 
legislation 
renames 
‘‘Walker Ridge’’ to ‘‘Condor Ridge,’’ 
which is translated from Molok Luyuk 
in the indigenous Patwin language. For 
thousands of years, these sacred lands 
have been central to Tribal origin sto-
ries, and Condor Ridge is an area that 
retains deep cultural significance to 
the Patwin people and over two dozen 
Native American tribes. The legisla-
tion also directs the BLM and USFS to 
complete the management plan for the 
national monument and to consult 
with federally recognized Tribes to do 
so. 
I am proud that this legislation 
would better enable federally recog-
nized Tribes to be involved in the day- 
to-day management of the national 
monument. This essential, landmark 
component of the legislation would en-
able Tribal communities to share their 
rich history and ecological knowledge 
to better conserve and care for these 
lands. 
With the protections provided by this 
legislation, the abundant natural re-
sources and the rich history on Molok 
Luyuk will be preserved for our chil-
dren and future generations. By requir-
ing the Federal Agencies to finally de-
velop a management plan and by allow-
ing for Tribal governments to be in-
volved in the management of the 
monument, the bill would improve the 
health of these lands to benefit both 
people and biodiversity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2133 
April 25, 2022 
I thank Senator FEINSTEIN for intro-
ducing this legislation with me, and I 
thank Congressmen GARAMENDI
and 
THOMPSON for spearheading this effort 
in the House of Representatives. I 
would also like to thank the Yocha 
Dehe Wintun Nation for their leader-
ship and desire to cooperatively man-
age ‘‘Molok Luyuk’’ to ensure that all 
Californians and Americans have the 
opportunity to benefit from these sa-
cred lands. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to enact the Berryessa Snow 
Mountain National Monument Expan-
sion Act as quickly as possible.

tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 594 
Whereas police officers, sheriffs and depu-
ties, and other law enforcement officers 
serve and protect their communities with 
honor and sacrifice; 
Whereas all individuals in law enforcement 
put their lives on the line while serving and 
protecting their local communities; 
Whereas when violent crime increases, law 
enforcement officers and the communities 
they serve are directly impacted; 
Whereas, in the month of March 2022, Mis-
souri experienced violent attacks against po-
lice officers, especially in rural areas; 
Whereas, in a 20-day period, 6 police offi-
cers in Missouri were shot in the line of 
duty, 3 of whom suffered injuries that were 
fatal; and 
Whereas these fallen officers include— 
(1) Corporal Benjamin Lee Cooper of the 
Joplin Police Department, who passed away 
in the line of duty on March 8, 2022, after at-
tempting to take a suspect into custody; 
(2) Police Officer Jake Alexander Reed of 
the Joplin Police Department, who passed 
away from injuries sustained in the line of 
duty on March 11, 2022, after attempting to 
take a suspect into custody; and 
(3) Patrolman Lane Anthony Burns of the 
Bonne Terre Police Department, who passed 
away in the line of duty on March 17, 2022, 
after responding to a disturbance: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses deep condolences for the Mis-
souri police officers who made the ultimate 
sacrifice in the line of duty; 
(2) recognizes the countless selfless and he-
roic actions carried out by local law enforce-
ment officers; 
(3) expresses strong support for police offi-
cers and law enforcement officers in rural 
areas and across the United States that 
serve and protect their local communities; 
(4) recognizes the need to ensure that rural 
law enforcement departments have the prop-
er equipment, training, and resources nec-
essary to protect officers and the individuals 
in the communities they serve; 
(5) acknowledges the importance of hon-
oring and remembering fallen police and 
local law enforcement officers killed in the 
line of duty; and 
(6) expresses condolences to the loved ones 
of each law enforcement officer across the 
United States who has made the ultimate 
sacrifice in the line of duty and whose sac-
rifice will not be forgotten.

WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OP-
POSE 
AN 
ATF 
NOMINEE 
WHO 
WANTS TO BAN THEIR RIGHT TO 
SELF-DEFENSE 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I oppose the 
nomination of Steve Dettelbach to Director of 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and 
Explosives (ATF). 
Our right to meaningful self-defense, and 
the concomitant right to bear arms, was so im-
portant to the Founders that it preceded the 
right to due process, a speedy trial, and rea-
sonable bail. That is how dangerous the 
Founders knew a tyrannical government could 
become. In order to protect those constitu-
tional rights and those in the First Amend-
ment—the right to speech, press, and assem-
bly—citizens must have the means to do so. 
And this right is not protected by the Con-
stitution alone. It—and the very closely related 
right of self-defense—is a civil right as well— 
or a right that serves to guarantee America’s 
foundational tenet of equality under the law. 
All of President Biden’s recent actions point 
to a very simple goal—he wants our guns. By 
taking our guns, he takes our right to self-de-
fense. Coming at a time when crime is at 
record levels in most democrat-run cities, self- 
defense is not a theoretical discussion. The 
news is filled daily with citizens being at-
tacked, raped, assaulted, maimed or otherwise 
hurt by assailants. Good people have the right 
and duty to defend themselves and their fam-
ily. And, we have seen government overreach 
as well—tyrannical tendencies by the Biden 
Regime to imprison its political opponents and 
political dissidents. Currently almost 800 
Americans have been arrested, many denied 
bail, for trespassing and other minor violations 
relating to January 6th, even though the fa-
vored criminals of the regime who looted, 
burned and murdered in the name of racial 
justice in 2020 walked away Scot free. 
In a country that has enshrined the right to 
self-defense, the mere existence of the ATF is 
anathema to the Constitution. We have no 
government agency running roughshod over 
newspapers and radio stations seeking to 
‘‘constrain’’ and ‘‘limit’’ the First Amendment. 
We have no government agency cracking 
down on the unbridled expectation and right to 
be secure in one’s possessions. But we do 
have the ATF, whose mission is to violate a 
constitutional right. 
The ATF recently and cleverly changed the 
definition of machine gun so that more guns 
would be considered illegal. ATF was caught 
red-handed recently compiling a registry of 
gun owners—an action explicitly contrary to 
federal law. And the DOJ just decided to seri-
alize thousands and thousands more firearms 
and expand the registry already approaching 
one billion records. 
The Biden administration wants there to be 
as big a paper trail as possible against those 
wishing to exercise their constitutional right. 
And we know the ATF is making lists of gun 
owners who made legal purchases—and just 
announced plans to expand that list. Why 
would they need all this information? Because 
with more information, the easier it is to con-
fiscate. The easier it is to blacklist. Citizens 
who oppose the regime have been added to 
secret lists in the hopes of prohibiting gun 
ownership. Without charges. Without a trial. 
And usually without notice. All of these ATF 
abuses are unconstitutional. 
If Biden were serious about violent crime, 
he would be funding our police officers and re-
buking Soros district attorneys for aiding and 
abetting violent criminals. Over 33 percent of 
first-time gun buyers in 2021 were women. 
Guns allow women to stand up to criminals 
who would otherwise overpower them. 
The cure to rampant violent crime is well 
known by criminologists. Enforce the law. 
Every time. Throw violent thugs in jail for dec-
ades. Throw drug dealers in jail. For decades. 
Federal laws that did this in the 1990’s worked 
wonders in reducing crime. The problem of vi-
olence is not an inanimate object. It is not a 
gun, a knife or a car that is to blame. It is al-
ways, always, in every instance, the operator 
of the gun, the knife or the car. Inanimate ob-
jects have no free will or ability to commit 
crimes. It is long past time we stop pretending 
they do. People are responsible for their own 
violent actions. The millions of law-abiding gun 
owners shall not be punished for the trans-
gressions of the violent minority. 
I am pursuing legislation in many areas to 
protect our right to defend ourselves from gov-
ernment. As the purpose of ATF’s existence is 
to harass and criminalize gun ownership, it 
must be eliminated. I also support bills that 
codify a federal right to self-defense, prohibit 
the administration from criminalizing many 
legal guns owned by Americans for decades 
through crafty and illegal regulatory maneu-
vers, defund federal attempts to prop up state 
registries of gun ownership, and nullify all ATF 
regulations approved by this gun-grabbing ad-
ministration. 
The ATF nominee Dettelbach is of the ap-
parent opinion that guns have free will and he 
blames the guns for violence. He is thus in 
favor of disarming as many people as pos-
sible. I have no confidence he will oppose 
Biden’s radical agenda to destroy our Second 
Amendment, which is not only unconstitutional 
but immoral and a threat to democracy. I op-
pose his nomination and I urge all senators to 
oppose this radical and his usurpation of Con-
stitutional rights.

LOGAN WYNES 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Logan Wynes 
for earning the Best in Show—Honorable 
Mention Award in the 2022 Congressional App 
Challenge. 
As a first-time participant in the challenge, 
Logan built an app entitled ‘‘Carbon Calcula-
tors’’ to create a calculator to track an indi-
vidual user’s weekly carbon output as a way 
to decrease individual carbon output and ulti-
mately encourage a carbon-neutral footprint. 
Logan, an eleventh grader from Golden 
High School, spent countless hours and used 
numerous tools to learn about coding and app 
development while developing new skills and 
further advancing their STEM education. Their 
perseverance and dedication to this challenge 
exemplifies the character and determination 
the faculty instills in the students at the school. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Logan Wynes for his hard work on this project. 
I am certain this student will exhibit the same 
dedication and character in his future accom-
plishments, and I wish him the best of luck 
going forward.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
LISA TROLAN 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the career of Lisa Trolan, 
who retired from her work with General Dy-
namics Electric Boat, on December 23, 2021. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Trolan retires from a 
long, dedicated career that spans 35 years 
with Electric Boat. As a senior member of 
Electric Boat’s Public Affairs team, Lisa wel-
comed thousands of visitors to the company’s 
locations in Connecticut and Rhode Island and 
helped to highlight the skilled workforce of 
technological marvels produced by Electric 
Boat. In doing so, Lisa has acted as a staunch 
advocate for our community, representing a 
major employer within the region to attract 
businesses, suppliers, and employees alike. 
A Groton, Connecticut native and a grad-
uate of the University of Connecticut, Lisa has 
lived out a destiny of nurturing the growth of 
the very community that raised her. These 
foundational values trace all the way back to 
her upbringing under her parents, Julio and 
Frances, who also served the town of Groton 
well through their longstanding, respective 
roles with Groton Utilities and the public 
school system. It is no coincidence that Elec-
tric Boat’s Connecticut headquarters is in 
Groton. It is also no surprise that even in re-
tirement, Lisa remains an active supporter of 
local civic organizations as well as the Univer-
sity of Connecticut. 
Madam Speaker, Lisa’s legacy with Electric 
Boat—one of excellence and commitment to 
its employees, the Navy and the Nation—is 
unrivaled. She has always prioritized giving 
back to her foundational roots and has played 
a direct part in adding oil to the economic en-
gine that is Electric Boat. To that end, I ask

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
A 
BILL 
TO 
CLARIFY CERTAIN DUE PROCESS 
RIGHTS OF FEDERAL EMPLOY-
EES SERVING IN SENSITIVE PO-
SITIONS 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill to clarify certain due process 
rights of federal employees serving in sen-
sitive positions. This bill would overturn an un-
precedented federal court decision, Kaplan v. 
Conyers and MSPB, which stripped many fed-
eral employees of the right to independent re-
view of an agency decision removing them 
from their jobs on grounds of ineligibility. The 
case was brought by two Department of De-
fense (DOD) employees, Rhonda Conyers, an 
accounting technician, and Devon Northover, 
a commissary management specialist, who 
were permanently demoted and suspended 
from their jobs after they were found to be no 
longer eligible to serve in noncritical sensitive 
positions. In 2014, the Supreme Court de-
clined to hear the case, which allowed the de-
cision to stand. This bill is cosponsored by 
Representative ANDRE´ CARSON. 
Specifically, the decision prevents federal 
employees who are designated as ‘‘noncritical 
sensitive’’ from appealing to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board if they are removed from 
their jobs. Noncritical sensitive jobs include 
those that do not have access to classified in-
formation. The decision affects at least 
200,000 DOD employees who are designated 
as noncritical sensitive. Even more seriously, 
most federal employees could potentially lose 
the same right to an independent review of an 
agency’s decision because of a rule by the Of-
fice of Personnel Management and the Office 
of the Director of National Intelligence that 
permits agency heads to designate most jobs 
in the federal government as noncritical sen-
sitive, which went into effect in July 2015. 
The Kaplan decision undercuts Title 5, sec-
tion 7701 of the Civil Service Act, which en-
sures due process rights for federal workers 
required by the U.S. Constitution. Stripping 
employees whose work does not involve clas-
sified matters of the right of review of an 
agency decision that removes them from their 
jobs 
opens 
entirely 
new 
avenues 
for 
unreviewable, arbitrary action or retaliation by 
an agency head and, in addition, makes a 
mockery of whistleblower protections enacted 
in the 112th Congress. This bill would stop the 
use of ‘‘national security’’ to undo a vital com-
ponent of civil service protection and of due 
process. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

TRIBUTE TO NORMAN LADD 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the life and accomplishments of 
Norman Ladd of Ohio’s Ninth Congressional 
District. Norman passed on from this life at 
age 84 years on March 21, 2022. He dedi-
cated a total of 65 years to the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. 
Norman Ladd was born in Toledo, Ohio on 
August 11, 1937. He attended Macomber High 
School and graduated in 1955. Not long after, 
he began his apprenticeship with his local 
IBEW, Local 8. During his time with the IBEW, 
he served as treasurer, assistant business 
manager, and administrator of the Health and 
Wellness plan. 
In the 1980’s, Norman was elected the Ex-
ecutive Secretary of the Northwest Ohio Build-
ing Trades. He also served on the Toledo 
Zoning Board of Appeals, and more recently 
he sat on the Sylvania Zoning Board of Ap-
peals. 
As Adlai Stevenson II once said, ‘‘Patriotism 
is not a short and frenzied outburst of emo-
tion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of 
a lifetime.’’ Norman Ladd lived a life of dedica-
tion and passion, always ready to lend a hand 
when needed. 
Today, we mourn his passing, and offer our 
deepest condolences to his wife and children. 
May they find some small measure in his leg-
acy and the gift of his life to his family, friends, 
fellow tradesmen and women, and our com-
munity at large. Norm was a builder of family 
and community through good and rough times. 
His commitment and vigilance helped carry us 
forward together. May his life and works in-
spire others to emulate his goodwill and ac-
complishments.

RECOGNIZING STAN KELLY 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Stan Kelly of Winston-Salem and 
congratulate him on his upcoming retirement 
as CEO of the Piedmont Triad Partnership. 
With his departure from this position, he 
leaves the entire Piedmont region revitalized 
and ripe for North Carolina’s next chapter in 
modern industry. 
Stan began his distinguished career as a 
personal banker with Wachovia National Bank, 
a North Carolina-based financial institution. 
His industrious work ethic, charismatic person-
ality, and keen intellect propelled him to the 
position of President of Wachovia’s wealth 
management 
division 
in 
2001. 
When 
Wachovia was acquired by Wells Fargo & 
Company in 2008, Stan was selected as the 
bank’s regional president for the Carolinas. In 
this role, he ensured the brand transition from 
Wachovia to Wells Fargo was seamless for 
employees and clients, alike. His region of 
more than 450 branches consistently overper-
formed company expectations in customer 
service ratings, employee retention, and mar-
ket share. Stan retired from Wells Fargo in 
2014, leaving the company well-positioned for 
future success in the region. 
In 2015, however, Stan was called out of re-
tirement when the Piedmont Triad Partnership 
selected him as its President and CEO. For 
over 30 years, the Piedmont Triad Partnership 
has served as the region’s umbrella organiza-
tion for economic development and has 
worked arduously to promote transformational 
commercial growth and success in the heart of 
North Carolina. The Partnership has been in-
strumental in building upon the Piedmont’s 
proud history of agriculture, textiles, and fur-
niture to facilitate new, robust sectors of indus-
try including aviation and automotive manufac-
turing, as well as the emerging sector of re-
generative medicine. 
As President and CEO of the Piedmont 
Triad Partnership, Stan again proved himself a 
remarkable leader. Under his direction, the 
Partnership launched the Carolina Core brand, 
a regional initiative to highlight existing infra-
structure and develop industrial potential along 
the future 1-685 corridor. Regional leaders 
have united with Stan in promoting this eco-
nomic engine capable of powering the Pied-
mont into the future. Stan’s efforts in devel-
oping the Carolina Core have already been in-
strumental in attracting over 30 thousand new 
jobs in just five years. 
Stan’s other accomplishments extend far 
beyond financial services and economic devel-
opment. Through various roles, such as Chair 
of the Board of Trustees of North Carolina 
State University and the Winston-Salem Foun-
dation, he has studiously worked to give back 
to his local community and state. Earlier this 
month, he was honored with North Carolina’s 
most prestigious civic award: The Order of the 
Long Leaf Pine. Despite all of Stan’s accom-
plishments, however, he is undoubtedly most 
proud of his loving family: his wife, their 
daughters, son-in-law, and grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Stan Kelly for his invaluable con-
tributions to the Piedmont Triad region and the 
state of North Carolina. I wish him the best in 
his well-deserved retirement.

RECOGNIZING FES SECURITY FOR 
50 YEARS OF SERVICE TO EAST 
TENNESSEE’S COMMUNITIES 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, today I 
recognize FES Security as it celebrates its 
50th anniversary. In April 1972, Frank Whitley 
started Frank’s Electrical Service to meet the 
electrical needs of his community. Frank en-
listed the help of his son, Dale, on the week-
ends and the work inspired Dale to earn a de-
gree in electronics so he could help run the 
family business. 
Frank and Dale soon noticed a growing de-
mand for home security, so Dale took the lead 
in getting Frank’s Electrical Service involved in 
the industry. This was a wise decision. The 
business quickly switched to specializing in 
home security and was rebranded as FES Se-
curity in the process. 
Dale Whitley, now the owner of FES Secu-
rity, is building on the successes of the com-
pany his father started. The business keeps 
up with modern technological advancements 
and FES Security offers digital security sys-
tems, products that are controllable through 
mobile devices, and cameras with video re-
cording capabilities. The company also offers 
fire and gate systems, as well as home the-

NORTHGLENN HIGH SCHOOL ROOK-
IE OF THE YEAR—HONORABLE 
MENTION AWARD RECIPIENTS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
and 
applaud 
Aiden 
Boushie, Victor Ibarra, Makayla Clemons and 
Alex Guzman for earning the Rookie of the 
Year—Honorable Mention Award in the 2022 
Congressional App Challenge. 
As first-time participants in the challenge, 
this team from Northglenn High School built 
an app entitled ‘‘School Club Finder’’ to help 
students discover the extracurricular activities 
at their school. 
The students spent countless hours and 
used numerous tools to learn about coding 
and app development while developing new 
skills and further advancing their STEM edu-
cation. Their perseverance and dedication to 
this challenge exemplifies the character and 
determination the faculty instills in the students 
at the school and the students’ commitment to 
being lifelong learners. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Aiden 
Boushie, 
Victor 
Ibarra, 
Makayla 
Clemons and Alex Guzman for their hard work 
on this project. I wish each student the best in 
all their future endeavors.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
TRICENTEN-
NIAL 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
TOWN OF CHESTER, NEW HAMP-
SHIRE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the tricentennial anniversary of 
the establishment of the Town of Chester, 
New Hampshire. First known as the Chestnut 
County, the name was later shortened to 
Chester after Cheshire County, England, 
whose county seat is Chester. 
Based in one of the thirteen original colo-
nies, Chester is one of the oldest towns in 
America and its history is tied to that of the 
entire nation. Throughout the post-Revolu-
tionary and the Civil War eras, Chester sup-
plied housing and goods for many fellow New 
Englanders and Americans. Beyond its cultural 
impact, Chester has also given the State of 
New Hampshire three governors, three sen-
ators, a chief justice of the State Supreme 
Court, and so much more. 
Chester reached its population low of just 
over 650 residents during the early 20th cen-
tury, but over the past 100 years, that number 
has grown to more than 5,000 residents. This 
quick growth is a testament to the charm and 
character of Chester, and I am confident that 
this town will continue to prosper for genera-
tions to come. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate the Town of Chester on this in-
credible milestone. I look forward to a contin-
ued partnership with Chester and its residents 
who I am proud to represent in Congress.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT COLO-
NEL THOMAS J. JENKINS UPON 
HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to recognize Lieutenant Colonel (Lt Col) 
Thomas J. Jenkins upon the auspicious occa-
sion of his retirement upon more than twenty 
years of tireless service to the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania and the United States of 
America. 
Lt Col Jenkins distinguished himself in the 
performance of outstanding service while as-
signed to the 193d Special Operations Squad-
ron. During this period, he served as the pilot 
section supervisor and flight commander, 
managing over sixty (60) aviators’ combat 
readiness, and recruited twenty-nine (29) rated 
officers, enhancing the group’s longevity. Addi-
tionally, he excelled through aircraft com-
mander, instructor, and evaluator pilot up-
grades in minimum time, and actively trained 
and evaluated special operations pilots—en-
suring the safety and effectiveness of flying 
operations. 
Throughout his career, Colonel Jenkins 
compiled over four thousand total flight hours 
in the MC–130W, AC–130W, C–130E/H, and 
EC–130J airframes. He flew eight hundred 
(800) hours as an instructor pilot, and totaled 
over seven hundred (700) career combat sor-
ties, fifteen hundred (1500) combat hours, and 
forty-four (44) combat support sorties. He de-
ployed and served as an aircraft commander, 
director of operations, and an expeditionary 
squadron commander on the EC–130J Com-
mando Solo in support of operations Inherent 
Resolve and Freedom’s Sentinel. 
Colonel Jenkins’ professionalism, expertise, 
and dynamic leadership contributed immeas-
urably to the overall mission effectiveness of 
the 193d Special Operations Group. The sin-
gularly distinctive accomplishments of Lieuten-
ant Colonel Thomas J. Jenkins culminate a 
distinguished career in the service of our 
Country and reflect great credit upon himself, 
the Air National Guard, and the United States 
Air Force. I wish him Godspeed as he em-
barks on his next adventure. 
HONORING 75 YEARS OF CINE EL 
REY 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the historic Cine 
El Rey, which has provided outstanding enter-
tainment to South Texans for 75 years. 
Cine El Rey opened its doors in 1947 and 
is one of the longest-running entertainment 
venues in the nation. Cine El Rey has hosted 
a variety of entertainment events over the last 
75 years, ranging from film screenings and 
concerts to wrestling events, and propelled the 
careers of many South Texas artists. 
Established during segregation, Cine El Rey 
was the only place where Latinos could watch 
movies in McAllen, Texas. Today, it is a hall-
mark of Hispanic entertainment. Cine El Rey 
is the only privately-owned National Historic 
Landmark representative of Hispanic Culture 
in America. 
In 2020, like many entertainment venues 
across the country, Cine El Rey was forced to 
close its doors due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Thankfully, with the support of our 
community and dedication of its owner, Burt 
Guerra, Cine El Rey has reopened and again 
offers the live entertainment it is so fondly 
known for. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today to cele-
brate the 75 years that Cine El Rey has been 
open and entertaining our community, and I 
look forward to celebrating many more years.

THE 
TX–03 
CONGRES-
SIONAL YOUTH ADVISORY COUN-
CIL 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 
members of the 2021–2022 Congressional 
Youth Advisory Council (CYAC) as the six-
teenth year of the program draws to a close. 
Over the past year, students in grades 9th 
through 12th from public, private, and home 
schools across Texas’ Third Congressional 
District participated in my youth program as 
they learned firsthand about our representative 
democracy. From student governments, ath-
letics, fine arts, honor societies, and a mul-
titude of community and civic organizations, 
these servant leaders proved to be engaged 
members of our community both inside and 
outside of the program. 
Over the course of the school year, students 
assembled on multiple occasions and had the 
unique opportunity to explore the roles of com-
munity leaders, engage in policy discussions, 
and offer innovative solutions to issues of the 
day. In addition to attending interactive infor-
mation sessions, these young leaders capital-
ized on their experience by completing various 
assignments and offering feedback on current 
events which corresponded with our meetings. 
These students consistently impressed me 
with their knowledge and willingness to en-
gage in thoughtful and constructive dialogue,

even when their opinions differed from one an-
other. It is a reminder that when we come to 
the table with a desire to improve and a will-
ingness to listen, there is nothing our nation 
can’t achieve. 
Now, as we conclude the Congressional 
Youth Advisory Council, I am filled with un-
wavering confidence that this next generation 
of solutions-minded leaders will work towards 
ushering our country to greatness. 
I thank every member of the Congressional 
Youth Advisory Council for their steadfast 
commitment to this program and for their ef-
forts to make our community stronger. It has 
been an honor to know them and serve them 
in Congress, and I look forward to seeing what 
each of them accomplish as they go forward.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
GEORGE CROUSE 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate and praise the career 
of George Crouse, of Stonington, Connecticut. 
The head coach of the Stonington High 
School girl’s tennis team, George has recently 
been named a recipient for this year’s Gold 
Key Award, a prestigious honor that cele-
brates icons in Connecticut athletics. As a 
coach at Stonington for nearly 50 years, 
Crouse, with the support of his athletes, has 
steered his teams to victory time and time 
again, proving his determination, work ethic, 
and irreplaceable coaching methods. It is no 
exaggeration when I say that George is a 
monumental pillar in not just the success of 
Stonington High School’s tennis team, but the 
entire Stonington community. 
A former student of the class of 1960 him-
self, 
George 
Crouse 
has 
represented 
Stonington High School and southeastern 
Connecticut impressively well. A truly dedi-
cated steward to Stonington, it was not long 
after his graduation that he returned to 
Stonington High to begin his career in coach-
ing in the fall of 1973, first as the boy’s tennis 
coach before transitioning to the coach for the 
girl’s team in 1987. George was also a long- 
time teacher at Stonington High—having 
racked up 37 years in the social studies de-
partment. In addition to his teaching and 
coaching careers, George has always sought 
to 
increase 
his 
role 
in 
supporting 
the 
Stonington community, even serving a stint as 
the town’s first selectman. Through his numer-
ous and renowned careers in the area, 
George has been an enduring force of moral 
fortitude for Stonington, impressing upon the 
town’s youngest generation the value of com-
munity spirit. 
George’s experiences as a high school 
teacher and as First Selectman have helped 
reinforce the qualities that have made him a 
prodigious coach. George is kind but firm, 
wise but humble. He takes his students seri-
ously and coaches them in ways that will help 
each succeed. His tenure and track record of 
well more than 800 career victories for boys’ 
and girls’ tennis are evidence enough of his 
natural leadership and passion for inspiring 
the best in others. However, his 2019 recep-
tion of the National High School Coach of the 
Year makes the record clear. This year’s Gold 
Key Award is yet another well-deserved notch 
in his belt. 
Clearly, George’s legacy as a coach for the 
Stonington Bears is one to-be emulated. His 
team is currently 5–0 overall and has three 
state championships and eight class tour-
nament championships under its belt. For his 
distinguished career, the tennis courts at 
Stonington High have already been dedicated 
in his name. Even so, he remains as humble 
as ever; thanking his players for getting him to 
where he is, including his own four children— 
Maggie, Liz, Ann, and George. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to represent 
a district that is comprised of such hard-work-
ing and community-oriented individuals like 
George. As the Congressman for Stonington, 
I have had a chance to see up close his pas-
sion for the town and I can attest he is true 
public servant. A wise teacher, a confident 
leader, and a passionate coach, George has 
exemplified to his own town, our state and our 
Nation the boundless limits of what can be ac-
complished when a community sticks together. 
I am confident that there are very few that are 
more deserving of the Gold Key Award as 
much as George, and that he will continue to 
raise the bar for Stonington High School. 
George is joined by his wife Ann and their four 
children in celebrating this major milestone for 
the family and the school. As he continues to 
make history as coach at Stonington High 
School, 
I, 
along 
with 
countless 
others, 
excitedly await the new milestones that he is 
bound to achieve. To that end, I ask my col-
leagues in the House to join me in honoring 
George Crouse for his unsurpassable coach-
ing career, further extending the legacy of his 
actions.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF U.S. 
ARMY SERGEANT ROY DELAUTER 
HON. DAVID J. TRONE 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commend the service of Sergeant Roy 
‘‘Buddy’’ Charles DeLauter, who made the ulti-
mate sacrifice for our country during the Ko-
rean War. 
A resident of Smithsburg, Maryland, Sgt. 
DeLauter bravely answered the call to defend 
the values of democracy and enlisted in the 
U.S. Army in 1948. 
On December 1, 1950, Sgt. DeLauter was 
tragically killed in action. Like many fallen 
service members of foreign wars, his remains 
could not be easily recovered and returned. 
For over 70 years, his family was deprived of 
the closure America’s Gold Star families so 
rightly deserve. 
Credit to the tireless efforts of his loved 
ones, Sgt. DeLauter was finally brought home 
this week to Hagerstown. Friday, he was given 
a proper burial with full military honors. 
By all accounts, Sgt. DeLauter was an ex-
emplar of the Army’s core values: loyalty, 
duty, respect, personal courage, honor, integ-
rity, and selfless service. To his family, the 
same. 
We are forever indebted to Sgt. DeLauter 
and his family for their service to this Nation.

HONORING THE LIVES OF 
AMERICAN WORKERS 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
on Workers Memorial Day to pay tribute to the 
workers across Ohio and America whose lives 
were taken from us far too soon. 
Every day, hardworking truck drivers, steel-
workers, teachers, postal workers, nurses, po-
lice officers, firefighters, electricians, construc-
tion workers, bus drivers, and so many more 
go to work to make, build, and grow America. 
It is through their efforts that America moves 
forward. 
Tragically, many workers never return to 
their families at the end of the day. The im-
mense void their absence leaves behind in the 
hearts of their loved ones and communities 
can never be filled. 
As a society, we have a sacred obligation 
and a moral responsibility to ensure the safety 
and wellbeing of those who labor to build up 
America. In acting on this mission, we must 
support the labor unions who day in and day

out uplift the Middle Class and assure dignity 
for workers. We must also hold to account 
those whose reckless disregard endangers the 
lives and wellbeing of workers. 
While progress has been made, there is still 
much more to be done. The loss of even one 
worker is one loss too many. Congress and 
the Administration must recommit itself to de-
livering the reforms that vigorously protect 
workers from harm, in every workplace across 
America, each and every day. 
On this solemn day, may the memories of 
those lost be lifted up in remembrance, and 
may their legacies of service be cherished for-
evermore.

HONORING MS. KAYING YANG ON 
HER 
APPOINTMENT 
TO 
THE 
PRESIDENT’S 
ADVISORY 
COM-
MISSION ON ASIAN AMERICANS, 
NATIVE 
HAWAIIANS, 
AND 
PA-
CIFIC ISLANDERS 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my constituent Ms. KaYing 
Yang for being appointed to the President’s 
Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, 
Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders by 
President Joseph R. Biden. On February 14, 
2022, Ms. Yang was sworn in as one of 25 
commissioners, bringing a variety of personal 
and professional experience and expertise to 
the President’s commission. 
The daughter of May Yia Yang, a farm girl, 
and Chia Chu Yang, who was a Lieutenant 
Colonel in the CIA’s Special Guerilla Unit 
(SGU) during the Secret War in Laos, Ms. 
Yang was among the first Hmong women to 
graduate from college in the United States in 
the mid-1980s. She earned her B.A. in Soci-
ology from the University of Colorado at Boul-
der. For more than two decades, Ms. Yang 
has been a passionate advocate for social jus-
tice who has built and led campaigns to ad-
dress community issues locally, nationally and 
globally including her very important work to 
support gender equity, education opportunity, 
and advocacy for refugee families. 
When she was just 25 years old, Ms. Yang 
became the executive director of the Women’s 
Association of Hmong and Lao (WAHL), one 
of the first two women’s organizations founded 
by Hmong-American women in Minnesota. 
Later she served as executive director of the 
Southeast 
Asia 
Resource 
Action 
Center 
(SEARAC), the oldest national advocacy orga-
nization for refugees who resettled in the 
United States from Cambodia, Laos and Viet-
nam after 1975. During this time Ms. Yang 
worked with various international development 
groups in Laos including the International Or-
ganization for Migration (IOM) to resettle 
15,000 Hmong refugees to the United States 
and other countries, and later aided Karen ref-
ugees with resettlement on the Thai-Burma 
border. 
In 2008, she began working for the Inter-
national Finance Corporation (IFC) to advance 
policies to improve the investment climate for 
private sector investment in Laos. While in 
Laos, she founded the first Hmong women’s 
organization to ensure development resources 
reached minority women and people who 
moved from remote areas to urban areas. 
After her return to Minnesota, Ms. Yang 
worked for the Coalition of Asian American 
Leaders (CAAL), and led a broad cross-racial 
coalition to pass the All Kids Count Act in Min-
nesota in 2016, a bill which requires that stu-
dents’ ethnicity be included in data collected to 
enable policy makers to direct resources to 
the most impacted communities. She was also 
instrumental to passing legislation in 2017 that 
created a nonprofit grant program for small 
nonprofits led by leaders of color that serve 
historically underserved communities. 
Ms. Yang and her fellow commissioners ad-
vise the President on ways the public, private, 
and non-profit sectors can work together to 
advance equity and opportunity for every 
AANHPI community. The Commission also ad-
vises on policies to address anti-Asian hate, 
xenophobia and violence—timely work given 
the recent rise in violence against our Asian- 
American neighbors. Further, they will find 
ways to build capacity in AANHPI communities 
through federal grantmaking and policies to 
address barriers facing AANHPI women, 
LGBTQ+ people, and people with limited 
English proficiency and disabilities. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the phenomenal work Ms. KaYing Yang 
and congratulating her on this appointment to 
the President’s Advisory Commission on Asian 
Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Is-
landers. Since finding refuge with her family in 
America at the age of 7, Ms. Yang has exhib-
ited outstanding devotion to improving the 
lives of members of the Hmong and Asian- 
American communities.

THE 
LIFE 
OF 
MICHAEL 
A. 
FINNEY, 
PRESI-
DENT, AND CEO OF THE MIAMI- 
DADE BEACON COUNCIL 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the extraordinary life of Mi-
chael A. Finney. Michael was a pillar in the 
business community in Miami-Dade County 
and known around the country for his ability to 
conduct business and spur economic growth. 
On a personal level, Michael was a dear friend 
and I will always cherish the time we spent to-
gether and the projects that we worked on for 
the people of Miami-Dade County during my 
tenure as Mayor. Lourdes and I send our 
prayers to his wife and children, Gina, Michael 
Jr., Marcus, and Austin. 
Known by many as an ‘‘intellectual,’’ Mi-
chael was brilliant, and more importantly, a 
deeply caring person. He dedicated his life to 
serving communities from his time in Michigan 
to his time in Miami-Dade County. One of his 
many initiatives, Miami Community Ventures, 
sought to help individuals from low-income 
neighborhoods and pair them with employers 
to help them earn a living wage. This is just 
one example of how Michael wanted to bring 
economic prosperity to everyone he could 
reach. 
Michael was an incredible businessman and 
embodied the American entrepreneurial spirit. 
He helped navigate the largest municipal re-
structuring of debt in the United States during 
his time in Michigan and played a key role in 
Miami-Dade’s response to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Although he was not an elected official, 
he was truly a public servant. 
The Miami-Dade County community will 
mourn the loss of Michael A. Finney; husband, 
father, grandfather, friend, and businessman.

SERVICE 
EM-
PLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION 
ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Courts and 
Public Defender Service Employment Non-Dis-
crimination Act, which would apply the District 
of Columbia Human Rights Act of 1977 
(DCHRA) to employees of the local D.C. 
courts and of the D.C. Public Defender Serv-
ice (PDS). In February, the D.C. Court of Ap-
peals held in Robertson v. District of Columbia 
that the DCHRA, which protects employees of 
the D.C. government and of private employers 
from discrimination, does not apply to employ-
ees of the local D.C. courts. The court has not 
ruled on the applicability of the DCHRA to 
PDS employees. 
The local D.C. courts and PDS are unique 
entities, and they sometimes fall through the 
regulatory cracks. They are neither federal nor 
D.C. government entities, though both were 
created and are funded by Congress, and 
their employees are treated as federal employ-
ees for some employee benefits. This bill

April 25, 2022 
would ensure that their employees have com-
prehensive protections from and remedies for 
employment discrimination. 
While employees of the local D.C. courts 
and of PDS are protected by federal anti-dis-
crimination laws, the DCHRA provides much 
broader protections and remedies for employ-
ees than federal anti-discrimination laws. 
While the D.C. Council may have the au-
thority to pass such a bill itself, only Congress 
has the clear authority to do so, given the ex-
press limitations in the D.C. Home Rule Act on 
the Council’s authority to legislate on matters 
affecting the local D.C. courts, and given that 
Congress has generally served as the legisla-
tive body for PDS. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.
