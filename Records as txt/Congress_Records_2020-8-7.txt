Congress is vested with the power to all own-
ers in fee, the ability to sell, lease. dispose, 
exchange, convey, or simply preserve land. 
The Supreme Court has described this enu-
merated grant as one ‘‘without limitation’’ 
Kleppe v New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529, 542–543 
(1976) (‘‘And while the furthest reaches of the 
power granted by the Property Clause have 
not been definitely resolved, we have repeat-
edly observed that the power over the public 
land thus entrusted to Congress is without 
limitation.’’) The exchange codified by this 
legislation is thus constitutional.

HONORING 
THE 
INTERNATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF DRILLING CON-
TRACTORS 80TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the International Associa-
tion of Drilling Contractors (IADC), which will 
celebrate its 80th anniversary in November of 
this year. 
Since its inception in 1940, IADC has grown 
into one of the world’s largest non-profit trade 
associations, now boasting over 1,000 mem-
bers across six continents. Members include 
companies involved in oil and gas drilling, pro-
duction, well servicing, oilfield manufacturing, 
and other rig-site services. 
As the Chairman of the Oil & Gas Caucus, 
I am proud to recognize IADC for 80 incredible 
years of promoting safety and innovation and 
for its continued commitment to advocacy and 
education. By convening conferences, issuing 
publications, offering accreditation courses, 
and hosting seven Student Chapters, IADC is 
supporting workers and cultivating the next 
generation of leaders in the industry. 
IADC and its members value community en-
gagement and recognize the risks and oppor-
tunities associated with climate change and 
conventional energy production. IADC con-
tinues to invest in education, innovation and 
research to ensure its members are informed, 
adaptable, and responsible stewards. 
Madam Speaker, for the last eight decades, 
the International Association of Drilling Con-
tractors has done yeoman’s work, and that de-
serves recognition. I am confident that this or-
ganization will continue leading the charge to 
fuel our world in a responsible and safe way 
in the decades to come.

HONORING MAJOR GENERAL JON 
A. JENSEN 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Major General Jon A. Jensen 
on his appointment as Director of the Army 
National Guard. 
Major General Jensen has led a dedicated 
life of service to our military and the American 
people. After graduating from the Northwest 
Missouri State University, he earned his com-
mission from the United States Army Officer 
Candidate School in Fort Benning, Georgia. 
He has served in a variety of command and 
staff positions in the Iowa and Minnesota 
Army National Guards—including commands 
at all levels of Minnesota’s storied 34th Red 
Bull Infantry Division—and earned a master’s 
degree from the United States Army Com-
mand and General Staff College, and the 
United States Army War College. 
Following his graduate studies, Major Gen-
eral Jensen served in military operations 
around the globe, deploying to Kuwait in 2001 
as a Major, and Iraq in 2007 as a Lieutenant 
Colonel. He also served as Deputy Com-
manding General for U.S. Army Africa. 
Since returning home, Major General Jen-
sen has delivered steadfast leadership as the 
31st Adjutant General of Minnesota’s National 
Guard. While our state will feel the loss of 
Major General Jensen’s presence, we are for-
tunate to see his years of dedication and serv-
ice elevate him to this prestigious post. 
Thank you, Major General Jensen, for your 
friendship and service to Minnesota. I wish 
you, your wife Cindy, and your entire family all 
the best in your new role. Our nation is safer 
because of you.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to encourage the 
United States Postal Service Inspector Gen-
eral to investigate and take corrective action 
on serious mail delivery problems in Chicago. 
For the last several years, I have heard 
frustrating stories from my constituents about 
serious deficiencies in mail delivery. These 
breakdowns in mail service are particularly 
bad in the Mt. Greenwood neighborhood in 
Chicago, but are also present in Beverly, Mor-
gan Park, and Scottsdale. Many constituents 
have reported that they have gone days with-
out receiving their mail, and that they have 
been treated disrespectfully when visiting the 
post office to inquire about their mail. These 
problems have not been rectified despite a 
town hall meeting I organized with USPS offi-
cials last year, and other follow on efforts. 
While COVID–19 is undoubtedly a burden 
on USPS operations, the problems in my com-
munity have been ongoing for years. Addition-
ally, recent media reports have indicated that 
poor mail delivery is not isolated within my dis-
trict, but instead has impacted much of Chi-
cago. 
In these challenging times, reliable mail and 
package delivery is critical for our communities 
to function. Constituents may be expecting tax 
refunds, 
stimulus 
payments, 
prescription 
drugs, and forms for unemployment insurance 
and other assistance programs, just to name 
a few essential items that arrive by mail. 
My amendment directs the USPS Inspector 
General to conduct an independent investiga-
tion since USPS has been unresponsive to my 
constituents’ concerns. It’s well past time to 
take action to improve mail delivery in my dis-
trict and in Chicago once and for all. USPS 
leadership must improve service across Chi-
cago to restore public trust in the institution 
and ensure that essential items arrive on time.

REMEMBERING THE LYNCHING OF 
BENJAMIN THOMAS 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
memory of Benjamin Thomas, a young African 
American man who was lynched by an angry 
white mob just down the road from this Capitol 
in Alexandria, Virginia one hundred and twen-
ty-one years ago. He was accused of assault-
ing a young white girl but was never given the 
chance to defend himself. During the evening 
of August 8, 1899, Thomas was pulled out of 
a city jail by a large crowd. He was bound with 
a rope and dragged six blocks to a lamppost 
on the corner of King and Fairfax Street. He 
was then stripped of his clothes and hanged. 
Before dispersing, the mob proceeded to 
shoot his body several times. No one was 
ever charged for this heinous crime. 
The lynching of Benjamin Thomas is only 
one of 86 documented lynchings committed in 
Virginia between 1880 and 1930. These acts 
of premeditated violence were deliberate at-
tempts by whites to terrorize and control black 
populations across the state. While the local 
black community of Alexandria was outraged 
in the wake of Thomas’ death, fear of addi-
tional white violence prevented any further ac-
tion. This was often the case, as members of 
these mobs rarely faced any consequences 
for their actions, or worse were implicitly or ex-
plicitly supported by members of law enforce-
ment. 
It is incumbent on all of us, particularly 
those born into privilege, to remember this 
shameful episode of our history and others 
like it. In doing so, we are better able to see 
the continuous chain of racially motivated vio-
lence against black Americans that spans our 
nation’s history. We can truly honor the mem-
ory of Benjamin Thomas along with the count-
less number of named and unnamed victims 
of racial violence by seeking justice for all 
Americans and working to build a more inclu-
sive society.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E732 
August 7, 2020 
On August 15, 1945, Imperial Japan surren-
dered to Allied forces in the Pacific—effec-
tively bringing an end to the hostilities of 
World War II. More than 150,000 American 
Servicemembers died in the Pacific Theater of 
WWII, including many Michiganders. Victory 
over Japan Day honors their sacrifice and 
celebrates the victory they helped ensure. In 
honor of V–J Day, VFW Post 2356 in Hillman, 
Michigan, hosts an annual community celebra-
tion. This celebration has been held for the 
past 75 years and includes a breakfast for 
local Veterans and parade—making Hillman 
the only town in Michigan that still celebrates 
the occasion with a parade. By coming to-
gether to honor those who stood up to defend 
and to serve, the people of Michigan’s First 
District can ensure that their sacrifice is never 
forgotten. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring the men and women who helped en-
sure victory in the Pacific Theater of World 
War II, and in thanking the Hillman VFW Post 
2356 for its efforts to ensure their sacrifice and 
devotion to our nation is never forgotten.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PRIVATE 
FIRST 
CLASS 
EVAN 
BATH 
OF 
OAK CREEK 
HON. BRYAN STEIL 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
remember the life, service, and sacrifice of Pri-
vate First Class Evan Bath of Oak Creek, Wis-
consin. 
Pfc. Bath grew up wanting to serve our 
country and become a Marine. Evan’s mother, 
Aleta, said he enjoyed typical hobbies for a 
teenager: drawing, playing video games, and 
studying his ancestry. However, unlike most 
his age, Evan answered a higher call—the call 
to service. After attending Oak Creek High 
School and graduating from Connections 
Academy, Bath joined the U.S. Marine Corps. 
Pfc. Bath was stationed at Camp Pendleton in 
San Diego, California when he lost his life dur-
ing a naval exercise on an amphibious assault 
vehicle. 
At only 19, Private First Class Bath dis-
played courage, strength, and a sense of duty 
beyond his years. 
Those who knew Evan said he was a loyal, 
loving, and caring man. Pfc. Bath is a hero. 
His bravery, dedication, and love of country 
will never be forgotten. 
Pfc. Bath’s mother, Aleta, said her son died 
doing what he loved—protecting his country. 
Evan embodied true selflessness and patri-
otism. 
Our nation will be forever grateful for Pfc. 
Bath’s sacrifice. 
On behalf of Wisconsin’s First Congres-
sional District, I thank Private First Class Evan 
Bath for his service and pray for his family and 
friends. We will never forget. 
HONORING 
TANNERS 
TEAM 
SPORTS AS A FOURTH DISTRICT 
HERO 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the exceptional work of Tan-
ners Team Sports in Hot Springs, Arkansas. 
The local company stepped up to the plate 
during COVID–19, transitioning the production 
of their famed baseball and pickleball products 
into developing high-quality face masks. 
As an economic shutdown approached, the 
cancellation of the spring baseball season put 
Tanners’ peak shipping season on hold. While 
many businesses shut down, Tanners got cre-
ative with a way to move forward, keep local 
jobs available and support the health and well- 
being of the communities around them. 
Owner Vince Signorelli and his staff worked 
tirelessly with their existing network to create 
a mask that would not only meet the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention’s protec-
tion recommendations, but also allow athletes 
to wear and still perform. Within just three 
weeks of planning and design, Tanners and 
their in-house clothing brand, Vulcan Sporting 
Goods, had these masks in production and 
distribution. 
This team of Fourth District citizens are he-
roes who have battled the COVID–19 pan-
demic directly. It is my hope that all Arkansans 
will see the value of their labor. Mr. Signorelli 
said it best when he said, ‘‘I can’t help but 
marvel at how the American Spirit is alive and 
well right here in Hot Springs, Arkansas.’’

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF THE REVEREND DOCTOR NA-
THANIEL EDMOND OF THE SEC-
OND BAPTIST CHURCH OF ELGIN 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to acknowledge the upcoming re-
tirement of the Reverend Doctor Nathaniel Ed-
mond of the Second Baptist Church of Elgin, 
and to commend his many decades of service 
to our community. Pastor Nate can begin the 
next chapter of his life secure in the knowl-
edge that he built a foundation of spiritual 
leadership that continues to support the youth 
he mentored, the local entrepreneurs he ad-
vised, and the faithful who found comfort in his 
ministry. 
Pastor Nate began his professional life at 
Alcoa Corporation, rising to a position of high 
executive leadership. Although committed to 
excellence in his chosen career, Pastor Nate 
found time lo assist his church, serving as an 
Associate Minister, Assistant Sunday School 
Superintendent, spiritual advisor to several 
church organizations, and coach of many 
church sports teams. After 31 years in the 
world of business, Pastor Nate answered a 
call to the ministry, and on February 20, 2000 
was installed as Pastor of Second Baptist 
Church. 
Under his stewardship, Second Baptist 
Church delivered strong moral leadership and 
tended to the needs of communities dev-
astated by poverty, disaster, famine and dis-
ease. 
Under 
his 
guidance, 
the 
church 
partnered with local schools lo mentor at-risk 
youth, and led initiatives including the Prison 
Ministry, ‘‘Operation Joshua’’ street ministry, 
and SAFE Ministry (to break the often multi- 
generational cycle of domestic violence). In 
the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Second 
Baptist Church rallied to aid families rendered 
homeless by the storm’s devastation, and in 
2007, as part of its effort to support the ongo-
ing ministry of World Vision, extended its com-
passion lo the people of Africa, helping to 
build a housing complex for teachers in Tan-
zania, and pledging continuing monetary sup-
port to over 130 Tanzanian children. 
This ever-expanding circle of service to oth-
ers was accompanied by growth in Second 
Baptist’s membership. Pastor Nate can take 
great satisfaction in the organization that will 
continue after his retirement, a structure that 
has evolved in size and sophistication ena-
bling 32 active ministries to flourish and attend 
to its members’ spiritual needs. He can rest 
easy knowing that under his leadership, Sec-
ond Baptist Church acquired and constructed 
a campus sufficient to serve its community for 
years to come. 
Pastor Nate’s ministry extended well beyond 
his church. He served on boards or in other 
capacities for many important organizations in 
the Elgin area, including the Alignment Col-
laborative for Education, Advocate Sherman 
Hospital, the United Way, Judson University, 
U–46 School District, the NAACP of Greater 
Elgin, and the African-American Christian Min-
ister’s Alliance. He has been honored for his 
work by the Rotary Club of Elgin and received 
the Partner in Peace Award from the Commu-
nity Crisis Center for Domestic Violence, the 
City of Elgin’s Martin Luther King Jr. Humani-
tarian Award, the Lasting Impact Award from 
Elgin Community College, and the Boys and 
Girls Club of Elgin Distinguished Citizen 
Award. 
For 26 years, Pastor Nate has ministered to 
his community and guided a vibrant congrega-
tion whose love and generosity reached far 
beyond its church walls. While he may be 
ending his service as Pastor, I know Pastor 
Nate will continue his life’s work of service to 
others. On behalf of the people of Illinois and 
all Americans, I wish Pastor Nate and his fam-
ily great happiness and fulfillment in the jour-
ney ahead.

and council meetings, the Chamber helps

services. 
In addition to its contributions to the South 
Florida business community, the Miami Beach 
Chamber of Commerce has made a lasting 
impact on countless children in Miami Beach. 
Through the Miami Beach Chamber Education 
Foundation, the organization has provided a 
number of kids with educational opportunities 
and access to medical care through scholar-
ships and grants to students and teachers in 
Miami Beach. 
I am pleased to extend my congratulations

it marks its 100th year of service. I am grateful 
for all this organization has done for our South

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF JOHN W. RUFFIN, JR. 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and legacy of my 
dear friend and fraternity brother, John W. 
Ruffin, Jr. John was a natural born leader who 
understood the importance of education and 
his duty to give back to the community. He 
passed away peacefully on Friday, July 24, 
2020, surrounded by his loving family. 
John first moved to South Florida in 1980 as 
an executive with Food Fair/Pantry Pride, Inc. 
His entrepreneurial spirit always drove him to 
start his own businesses. He made this dream 
a reality when, in 1986, he and his business 
partner purchased WRBD, establishing the 
first black-owned radio station in South Flor-
ida. John and his wife, Dottie, fanned a part-
nership with a travel retailer and to this day 
operate shops throughout Florida, while also 
providing consultation services to new busi-
nesses. 
As a philanthropist, John tirelessly advo-
cated for a number of community and civic 
groups. As Chairman of the United Negro Col-
lege Fund, he helped raise more than two mil-
lion dollars in scholarships for Broward County 
students. He also served as the Chairman of 
the Urban League of Broward County, and 
Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees at 
Florida Memorial University. As Chairman and 
Board Member of the Internet Coast Initiative 
Council he helped to provide high tech access 
to underserved communities in South Florida. 
John’s dedication to helping those less fortu-
nate is inspiring and his presence in South 
Florida will be missed. 
Madam Speaker, John always gave back to 
the 
community, 
earning 
him 
numerous 
awards. He truly was selfless and determined 
to make a difference in the lives he touched. 
I extend my heartfelt condolences to John’s 
family and friends, during this extremely sad 
time. John’s legacy and loving memory will al-
ways live on. He will be dearly missed. 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to redirect an addi-
tional $25 million within the Department of En-
ergy Office of Science to increase support for 
the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. 
The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility 
is at a critical moment as it prepares for the 
2021 deployment of Aurora, the first exascale 
computer in the United States if not the world. 
As planned, Aurora will be able to perform one 
quintillion, or one billion billion, operations per 
second. 
My amendment will allow America to reach 
this goal. Argonne’s Leadership Computing 
Facility needs the additional funds to cover in-
creased cost of High-Bandwidth Memory, 
which will be necessary to reach and sustain 
exascale computing performance. Without ad-
ditional funding to support Aurora’s memory, 
the entire exascale project is at risk, and the 
resulting smaller machine will not be able to 
perform all of the powerful computations 
planned. 
If fully funded, America will remain competi-
tive in the global supercomputing race. Addi-
tionally, our scientists will gain a powerful tool 
for research in drug discovery, energy produc-
tion, materials science, and additive manufac-
turing. 
It is an economic and national security im-
perative that the United States maintains lead-
ership in supercomputing by developing an 
exascale computer as planned. I ask my col-
leagues to support this amendment.

HONORING EMMANUEL SMITH AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, 30 years 
ago—on July 26, 1990—the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law, 
prohibiting discrimination against individuals 
with disabilities in all facets of life ranging from 
employment and transportation to public ac-
commodations and government services. 
That is why today, in light of the anniversary 
of this revolutionary legislation, I rise to ask 
the House of Representatives to join me in 
recognizing Emmanuel Smith, Protection and 
Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security 
advocate at Disability Rights Iowa, as this 
week’s Iowan of the Week. 
Emmanuel was born with Osteogenesis 
Imperfecta, also known as Brittle Bone Dis-
ease, which causes his bones to break easily. 
Disability rights is a critical aspect of his life— 
and he’s turned to giving back to this commu-
nity and advocated on their behalf as his driv-
ing force. Emmanuel also found inspiration 
from meeting our Senator, Tom Harkin, the 
author and chief sponsor of the ADA, at its 10- 
year anniversary celebration. 
After graduating from Drake University, Em-
manuel began working for Disability Rights 
Iowa. He works hard to ensure others don’t 
have to face the same difficulties that he has 
in the past, and seeks to take down barriers 
to employment and fight workplace discrimina-
tion against individuals with disabilities. 
Emmanuel’s role within DRI has evolved as 
they address the additional challenges brought 
by 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Emmanuel 
stepped up to the challenge and continues to 
fight for equitable employment services by 
teaching people about their rights in the con-
text of working during a pandemic. 
Emmanuel attributes many of the opportuni-
ties he’s had to the ADA, claiming that without 
its protections, his life would look very dif-
ferent. 
Without the ADA, he would not have had 
access to traditional education in high school 
or college. Accessible busing and Para-
transit—services Emmanuel and many others 
rely on so they may travel independently— 
would not be possible if not for the ADA. 
But while Emmanuel believes that the ADA 
has given people the possibility not to be re-
stricted by their disabilities, he knows that 
there is still a long way to go before the inten-
tions of the bill are fully realized. Emmanuel 
continues to advocate for universal, accessible 
design in Iowa cities and towns, push for an 
inclusive design for the Iowa caucuses, and 
push for putting more individuals with disabil-
ities in leadership positions. 
As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, we must re-
member the importance of equality for all 
Americans. I am proud to know that there are 
people in Iowa like Emmanuel Smith who ad-
vocate for equal opportunities for their fellow 
Iowans and inspire the rest of us to join in this 
fight. 
It is my honor to share Emmanuel Smith’s 
story today, and recognize him as our Iowan 
of the Week.

HONORING AND RECOGNIZING THE 
BRAVERY 
AND 
HEROISM 
OF 
ANSELM ‘‘JERRY’’ CRAMER AND 
CALLING ON THE DEPARTMENT 
OF THE NAVY TO AWARD MR. 
CRAMER THE PURPLE HEART 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a great American and veteran in 
my district, Mr. Anselm ‘‘Jerry’’ Cramer. 
Mr. Cramer joined the Navy Reserve in 
1948 and enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1950 
during the Korean War. In December of 1950, 
Mr. Cramer fought in the Battle of Chosin Res-
ervoir, where he suffered severe frostbite 
wounds to his hands and feet. Mr. Cramer 
spent weeks in the hospital for treatment to 
his injuries. Since then, Mr. Cramer has been 
denied a Purple Heart four times. 
As a member of the 1st Marine Division, Mr. 
Cramer fought in the Battle of Chosin Res-
ervoir, braving subzero temperatures without 
shelter for ten days. In conditions this harsh, 
frostbite can develop in a matter of minutes, 
hypothermia and death setting in shortly after. 
Mr. Cramer has described how his duties in-
cluded loading dead Marines onto trucks, their 
bodies frozen solid from the cold and wind. 
By the time he made it to the safety of an 
aid station, Mr. Cramer’s hands and feet were 
black from frostbite, and he could no longer 
grip or feel anything with them. He was evacu-
ated to a hospital in Japan for immediate 
treatment. Mr. Cramer watched as military per-
sonnel on his ward received a Purple Heart for

frostbite wounds, but he was overlooked. Mr. 
Cramer has never fully recovered from his 
frostbite injuries and currently receives a forty 
percent disability rating for the wounds he sus-
tained in December of 1950. 
Mr. Cramer has repeatably been denied a 
Purple Heart due to a change in regulation 
made months after his injuries occurred. In in-
quiries submitted by my office, the Board of 
Corrections of Naval Records has acknowl-
edged Mr. Cramer’s injuries, but maintains 
that he does not qualify due to the Secretary 
of the Navy’s 1951 decision to disqualify frost-
bite for the Purple Heart. They also state that 
fellow Marines were ‘‘erroneously awarded the 
Purple Heart’’. This is not a medal that is 
given out in error. The Purple Heart that is 
awarded due to an injury or wounds inflicted 
from an outside force or element, which is ex-
actly how Mr. Cramer received his injuries. 
Mr. Cramer is now in his 90s; he has fought 
and sacrificed a great deal for the country he 
loves. This December will mark 70 years since 
Mr. Cramer sustained his injuries. It is past 
time that he receives the recognition he has 
earned.

HONORING MELISSA GIRMSCHEID 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the achievement of Melissa 
Girmscheid, an extraordinary teacher at a pub-
lic high school in my district. 
Melissa has dedicated the last nine years to 
teaching Physics and STEM classes at Cen-
tennial High School in Peoria, Arizona. This 
year, she was selected as the Air Force Asso-
ciation of Arizona Teacher of the Year and 
placed second overall in the Air Force Asso-
ciation Rolls Royce 2020 National Aerospace 
STEM Teacher of the Year award. 
Melissa’s leadership has influenced organi-
zations throughout the nation to increase edu-
cational opportunities and advocate for the 
value of STEM education and employment in 
their communities. 
Melissa has created innovative STEM en-
gagement opportunities that will continue to 
shape the perceptions of STEM education and 
employment into the future. I am confident that 
because of her efforts to expand access to 
high school physics and foundational STEM 
courses, Arizona students will be inspired to 
pursue careers as STEM professionals or fu-
ture educators. 
On this day, we as a community would like 
to congratulate Melissa Girmscheid on her se-
lection as Air Force Association of Arizona 
STEM Teacher of the Year and thank her for 
her dedication and advocacy for quality edu-
cation for our nation’s youth.

HONORING BETTY FAIRFAX 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Betty Harriet Fair-
fax, who passed away on November 7, 2010. 
An educator philanthropist, and community 
leader, Betty devoted her life to ensuring that 
all students, regardless of background, have 
equal opportunity and access to the American 
Dream. Teaching in public schools for nearly 
70 years, Betty’s life was marked by service 
and generosity and today Arizona is a more 
just and equal place because of her work. 
From an early age, Betty was ingrained with 
the belief that all children deserve a quality 
education. Growing up in Cleveland, Ohio with 
her parents, Dan and Inez Wood Fairfax, Betty 
was an accomplished student and received 
degrees from Kent State University and West-
ern Reserve. After graduating with her mas-
ter’s degree, Betty began a public school ca-
reer that would reflect the arc of the moral uni-
verse. Initially recruited by Phoenix Union High 
School District to teach at Carver High School, 
the legally segregated school for Black chil-
dren, Betty ended her career over a half-cen-
tury later as a beloved Dean of Students and 
with a high school named after her. Her life-
long devotion to public education was honored 
many times and upheld as an example of a 
selfless leader who dedicated her career— 
without fanfare or in pursuit of recognition—to 
the students she taught and counseled. 
Betty’s commitment to education extended 
beyond excellence in teaching and into cre-
ating endowments for those who suffered 
most from educational inequities. Together 
with her sister Jean, Betty formed permanent 
financial legacies that support the spectrum of 
public education, from scholarships for Black 
students committed to being public school 
teachers to funding professional development 
opportunities for educators. Today, students 
and teachers across the nation benefit from 
Betty’s generosity and philanthropy, and her 
visionary leadership has created intergenera-
tional prosperity and opportunity for families in 
Arizona. 
Arizonans owe a debt of gratitude to Betty. 
Her investment in public education will be felt 
for generations to come and will ensure that 
more students be included in the American 
Dream. In this spirit of gratitude and remem-
brance, I rise today to honor the life and leg-
acy of Betty Harriet Fairfax.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF FORMER TEXAS STATE REP-
RESENTATIVE 
JOHN 
CLIFFORD 
OTTO 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and service of former Texas 
State Representative John Clifford Otto who 
passed away after a lengthy battle with pan-
creatic cancer on August 1, 2020. Representa-
tive Otto served the people of House District 
18 with distinction for six terms in the Texas 
House of Representatives. 
John Otto was born on October 14, 1948 in 
Dayton, Texas to John Clifford Coffelt Otto 
and Susan Eugenia Forrest. John graduated 
from Dayton High School in 1966 where he 
was a pitcher on the baseball team, member 
of FFA, and was drum major for the DHS 
band. He married his high school sweetheart, 
Nancy Whitman, in 1969. 
In 1970, Otto graduated from Texas A&M 
University with a bachelor’s degree in Busi-
ness Administration Accounting. While at 
Texas A&M, John Otto was a member of the 
Corps of Cadets; Ross Volunteer Honor 
Guard, official Honor Guard of the Governor of 
Texas; and the nationally famous Fightin’ 
Texas Aggie Band. In his senior year at Texas 
A&M, he was head drum major of the Texas 
Aggie Band. On July 24, 2020, Texas A&M 
University announced that the Aggie Band will 
forever be led with the ‘‘John C. Otto ’70 Drum 
Major Baton.’’ 
Following his graduation as a Distinguished 
Military Graduate, Otto received a commission 
as a Second Lieutenant in the United States 
Army where he served as a finance officer at 
Fort Benjamin Harrison. Otto served in the 
Army for eight years on active duty and in the 
Army Reserves before being honorably dis-
charged. After his military service, John and 
Nancy Otto returned to Texas. John worked 
for Peat, Marwick, Mitchell in Houston for five 
years, then returned to Dayton to open a pri-
vate practice, as a Certified Public Accountant 
serving clients for 35 years. 
Prior to his service in the Texas Legislature, 
John was a member of the Dayton City Coun-
cil, trustee of the Dayton Independent School 
District, board member of the Liberty County 
Central Appraisal District and the Dayton 
Chamber of Commerce, and director of the 
Dayton Community Development Corporation. 
In November 2004, John Otto was elected 
to the Texas House of Representatives where 
he served House District 18 for six terms. Dur-
ing his service, Representative Otto rep-
resented the people of Liberty, San Jacinto, 
Walker, Polk, and Montgomery Counties. Rep-
resentative Otto served on numerous commit-
tees in the Texas House, but the bulk of his 
time was spent on the Appropriations and 
Ways and Means Committees. Representative 
Otto served as Chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee, during his final legislative session 
he drafted and authored a bill that balanced 
the State Budget of more than 200 billion dol-
lars. He loved serving in the Texas House and 
considered it a high honor and privilege to 
represent District 18. 
During his tenure in the Texas Legislature, 
Representative 
Otto 
received 
numerous 
awards and distinctions. During his first term 
Otto was named ‘‘Freshman of the Year’’ by 
the House Republican Caucus, ‘‘Rookie of the 
Year’’ by Texas Monthly Magazine, and ‘‘Most 
Valuable Freshman’’ by Capitol Inside. In 
2008, he earned the ‘‘Legislative Achievement 
Award’’ from the Texas Taxpayers and Re-
search Association. He was also named ‘‘One 
of the 10 Best Legislators in Texas’’ by Texas 
Monthly in 2008 and 2015. Representative 
Otto additionally also received the ‘‘Citizen of 
the Year’’ award from the Liberty-Dayton Area 
Chamber of Commerce, ‘‘Fighter for Free En-
terprise’’ award from the Texas Association of 
Business and named to the Texas PTA Legis-
lative Honor Role. On June 15, 2020, the Day-
ton City Council renamed a portion of State 
Highway 146 the John Otto Expressway in 
recognition of his service to the citizens of 
Dayton. 
John and Nancy were active members of 
the First United Methodist Church in Dayton, 
TX where they both sang in the choir and 
John served in many capacities including 
church treasurer for over 25 years.They re-
cently transferred their membership to the

A&M United Methodist Church. Following his 
retirement from the Texas Legislature and pri-
vate sector, John and Nancy moved to Bryan, 
Texas. 
From 2017 until the time of his death, John 
served as the Assistant Vice Chancellor and 
Director of Local Government Relations for the 
Texas A&M University System. He considered 
this his dream job, working with former col-
leagues in the Legislature and advocating for 
his beloved Texas A&M University and other 
schools and agencies in the TAMU System. 
John is survived by his wife of 50 years, 
Nancy Whitman Otto; sons and daughters-in- 
law, Bryan and Lisa Otto, Jason and Brandee

his lifetime of faithful service and devotion to 
his country, state, community, and university. 
My thoughts and prayers remain with his fam-
ily and friends.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of this amendment to raise the funding for the 
Department of Defense National Innovation 
Security Network to $40 million, and to ensure 
continuation of their critical Hacking for De-
fense program. 
Hacking for Defense began as a college 
course created by Steve Blank at Stanford 
University in 2016 and has since expanded to 
more than 30 universities across the nation, 
with more added every year. This course 
teaches student teams to rapidly solve chal-
lenging national security problems by har-
nessing the lean start-up methodology devel-
oped in Silicon Valley. 
Through this program, the Department of 
Defense and other national security partners 
have the opportunity to present their most 
pressing challenges to energetic talent within 
universities classrooms across the nation. U.S. 
military combat veterans and entrepreneurial 
mentors then guide students in applying cut-
ting-edge research and problem-solving tech-
niques to address these real-world problems. 
The program has led to innovations in areas 
such as video surveillance of working military 
dogs, 3–D printing spare parts for Marine field 
vehicles, and countering drones. To date, nine 
start-ups have spun-off to further develop and 
address solutions to these challenges. 
The House Armed Services Committee re-
port accompanying the FY21 National Defense 
Authorization Act noted that Hacking for De-
fense, ‘‘Supports solution development directly 
for the warfighter, improves U.S. military readi-
ness and stimulates growth within the National 
Security Innovation Base, consistent with the 
2018 National Defense Strategy.’’ Further-
more, the Committee noted that Hacking for 
Defense fosters emerging national security 
leaders and mission-driven entrepreneurs. 
In recognition of the importance of this work, 
the NDAA authorized the National Security In-
novation Network at $40 million. Unfortunately, 
the defense division of this bill in its current 
form only appropriates half of this funding. I 
helped offer this bipartisan amendment to re-
program an additional $20 million in order to 
match the authorization level. This will allow 
Hacking for Defense to continue developing 
solutions to national security problems, and 
more importantly, to continue exposing stu-
dents to the national security challenges and 
growing the national security workforce. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment and the critical Hacking for Defense pro-
gram.

HONORING THE SELFLESS CAREER 
AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF DEBBIE 
LAIRD ON THE EVENT OF HER 
RETIREMENT 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Debbie Laird on the 
occasion of her retirement from Janus Devel-
opmental Services. Debbie has spent her ca-
reer helping people, including her most recent 
role as the Senior Vice President of Develop-
ment at Janus Developmental Services. She is 
a selfless, caring person with whom I am for-
tunate to know and call my friend. 
Janus is a non-profit agency that has served 
our community for nearly forty years. I visited 
Janus multiple times throughout my time in 
Congress and I strongly believe in the work 
they do. The group provides opportunities for 
clients with developmental disabilities such as 
autism or cerebral palsy. They provide them 
an opportunity to get real world work experi-
ence and use their creativity to better our 
community. For many years, Debbie dedicated 
herself to helping these individuals. This 
speaks to her selflessness and her desire to 
better the lives of those in her community. 
Along with her tremendous work at Janus, 
Debbie is the mother of fallen Indianapolis Po-
lice Officer Jake Laird, who was killed in the 
line of duty in 2004. She and her husband 
Mike have used their loss to create good in 
our community as well as in the law enforce-
ment community. They were fervent advocates 
for red flag legislation named for their son that 
was enacted into law in the State of Indiana 
the year after his death. In honor of Jake’s 
passion for public service, the Lairds created 
the Jake Laird Memorial Fund in 2004. For 
sixteen years Debbie and Mike have been 
raising money for those with the same passion 
as their son Jake. 
The mission of the memorial fund is to pro-
vide financial contributions to law and fire de-
partment agencies for the purchase of new 
equipment, the institution of new instructional 
programs, or financial assistance to officers in-
jured in the line of duty. The main event that 
contributes to this fund is the annual Jake 
Laird Memorial Golf Outing. What started as 
an event with eighty golfers in 2004, has 
grown to one with over 360 golfers in 2019. 
As of January 2020, the Jake Laird Memorial 
Fund donated over $950,000 to various police 
and firefighter causes throughout the state of 
Indiana. 
I am very proud to be able to call Debbie a 
friend. Her advocacy for so many throughout 
her career has produced real and lasting 
change throughout our community. On behalf 
of the people of Indiana’s Fifth District, I thank 
Debbie for her life-changing dedication to our 
community. I wish her a very happy and well- 
deserved retirement, although I know her serv-
ice will continue.

Now more than ever, we’ve seen the impact 
of our communities’ first responders and front-
line workers, and in the Fourth Congressional 
District, none are more appreciated than our 
police. Throughout this pandemic, Hot Springs 
officers have continued to put their own safety 
on the line defending our streets, homes and 
businesses. 
I take this time to honor these brave men 
and women who have stepped up, providing 
the Fourth District of Arkansas and the rest of 
the nation with a prime example of what it 
means to serve the people around you.

HONORING MICHELLE GARCILAZO 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Michelle Carmen 
Garcilazo for five years of exemplary service

Congressional District. As a valued member of 
my staff, Michelle has been essential to my 
work in the congressional district, and of spe-
cial note, has helped thousands of my con-
stituents with complicated issues. 
Michelle grew up in Sacramento, California. 
She earned a BA in Spanish with a minor in 
Chicano Latino Studies from Sonoma State 
University. She later obtained a Master’s De-
gree in Public Administration and a Certificate 
in Non Profits, also from Sonoma State Uni-
versity. Michelle proceeded to work in the non- 
profit sector first as a family advocate in Bay 
Area public schools, then with the San Fran-
cisco-Marin Food Bank as a Senior Program 
Coordinator. In 2015 Michelle joined my staff 
as a Marin County field representative and 
constituent caseworker. She excelled in this 
role, steadily developing her skill set. In 2017 
her responsibilities expanded to include immi-
gration casework services for the entire con-
gressional district, with a population of more

than 720,000. In this capacity Michelle has 
been able to leverage her college degrees and 
bilingual skills to help resolve complex prob-
lems for many individuals in need. 
Michelle is deeply principled, a hard worker, 
and an excellent team player. She consistently 
took on challenges to serve others using her 
intelligence, diplomacy, and empathy. Re-
cently, Michelle served as the only staffer sup-
porting a congressional fact-finding visit, when 
I traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border along with 
my colleague Congressman COLIN ALLRED. 
Michelle’s language skills, subject matter 
knowledge, and ability to build trust allowed us 
to communicate with individuals seeking asy-
lum in the United States. This firsthand experi-
ence provided us with valuable insights on 
how the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico 
border is impacting national security, and how 
the complexities and ambiguities of immigra-
tion law, as well as changes in the law’s appli-
cation, can affect families on both sides of the 
border. She has worked on high-profile cases 
for my constituents, including complicated im-
migration work for the Washington Post jour-
nalist Jason Rezaian and his family following 
his imprisonment in Iran. 
Over the years; Michelle has developed a 
keen understanding of how her casework in-
forms my legislative agenda. She has worked 
with all levels of government, non-profits, com-
munity groups, and businesses to help ad-
dress key local problems. She has become an 
integral member of my district staff, and she 
will be sorely missed as she leaves us to pur-
sue law school. Madam Speaker, I hope you 
will join me and my staff in extending to 
Michelle our deep appreciation for her many 
good deeds and wishing her the best in all her 
future endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. CARL 
REINER 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the life of Mr. Carl 
Reiner, a beloved American and resident of 
California’s 33rd Congressional District, who 
passed away at the age of 98 on June 29, 
2020. With decades of work as an Emmy-win-
ning writer, actor, director and producer, Carl’s 
comedic genius and generous spirit impacted 
not only the world of comedy but also deep-
ened our understanding of the human condi-
tion. 
Born on March 20, 1922 in The Bronx, Carl 
graduated high school at 16 and started work-
ing as a shipping clerk and then as a machin-
ist’s helper before discovering a newspaper 
announcement for free drama classes spon-
sored by the Works Progress Administration. 
From there, Carl began acting at a midtown 
Manhattan theater and joined a Shake-
spearean repertory company. He even took a 
job performing at Allaben Acres, a summer 
camp for adults in the Catskills where he met 
jazz singer Estelle Lebost, his wife for 65 
years who passed in 2008. 
Drafted into the Army during World War II, 
Carl trained as a French interpreter at George-
town University before touring the South Pa-
cific in G.I. revues in the Special Services en-
tertainment unit. After his honorable discharge 
in 1946, Carl branched into performing Broad-
way musicals, until landing a spot in an NBC 
comedy sketch show entitled ‘‘Your Show of 
Shows’’ as an actor and a writer. In this writ-
ing room with Mel Brooks, Mel Tolkin, Lucille 
Kallen, and Neil and Danny Simon, the idea of 
the 2,000-Year-Old-Man routine came to life 
with fellow comedian and director Mel Brooks. 
Later, while writing for singer Dinah Shore’s 
variety, Carl developed the idea for ‘‘The Dick 
Van Dyke Show,’’ a comedy sitcom based on 
his own life experiences. This highly success-
ful and well-crafted show would run for five 
seasons and earn Carl multiple Emmys for 
writing and producing. 
After ‘‘The Dick Van Dyke Show,’’ Carl 
transitioned into a full-time director, creating 
films like ‘‘The Jerk’’ (1979), ‘‘Dead Men Don’t 
Wear Plaid’’ (1982), ‘‘The Man with Two 
Brains’’ (1983) and ‘‘All of Me’’ (1984) with 
actor Steve Martin during the 1970s and 
1980s. In his later years, Carl would return to 
acting, with his reoccurring roles in the tele-
vision sitcom Frasier and the Ocean’s Eleven 
movie franchise, and even becoming a prolific 
writer of books. As Carl once said, ‘‘The abso-
lute truth is the thing that makes people 
laugh.’’ 
Carl is survived by his son Rob Reiner, a 
noted actor, director, producer, and political 
activist; son Lucas Reiner, an artist; daughter 
Annie Reiner, a psychoanalyst; and his five 
grandchildren. May his compassion, kindness, 
and dedication to the craft of comedy continue 
to live on through the millions of people he 
brought joy to and inspired.

is why today, I rise to ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing the Iowa 
Mask Brigade as this week’s Iowan of the 
Week. 
The Iowa Mask Brigade was founded earlier 
this year by Connie Klug after she received a 
distressed call from her niece, an emergency 
room doctor in desperate need of PPE. 
Connie immediately got to work researching 
protective masks and found that filters were 
the most important feature that made them ef-
fective. Although commercial face mask filters 
were not available, Connie used her problem- 
solving skills to create her own. She began 
cutting furnace filters from the company 3M, 
the same company that produces the coveted 
N95 masks. Sandwiching this filter in between 
two layers of high-quality cotton fabric, Connie 
produced her first mask in a process the New 
York Times would later consider the best 
method of making homemade masks. Connie, 
a quilter, enlisted the help of two of her seam-
stress friends, who enlisted the help of their 
friends, and an organization instantly formed 
as volunteers coalesced around one simple 
idea: to provide masks to those who need 
them. 
In their first month of operation, the Iowa 
Mask Brigade used over 75 furnace filters. 
Today, the Iowa Mask Brigade consists of 35 
volunteers who have collectively produced al-
most 8,000 masks since its inception in 
March. 
One of those volunteers is Ray Getting, who 
handles much of the logistics within the Bri-
gade. In a recent conversation, he mentioned 
everyone who has received a mask is so in-
credibly appreciative. The group maintains ex-
tremely high standards for quality, and if a 
mask wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t sent out. He’s 
been able to send high quality masks to peo-
ple he cares about in places he knows it’s 
going to make a difference. 
As the organization has grown, their mask- 
making has become more innovative. When 
the Brigade ran out of elastic bands for ear 
loops, they turned to hairbands. Today, they 
have purchased over 25,000 hairbands for 
their masks, and they have shared this tech-
nique, as well as many others they have de-
veloped, with other mask-making organiza-
tions. 
The Iowa Mask Brigade has sent masks to 
people in need all over the United States. 
From the Iowa’s Dallas County Hospital to 
San Antonio to the Navajo Nation in Arizona, 
for whom they have created a custom design 
to fit their preferences. Now, the Brigade 
mostly serves low income housing, hospitals, 
and nursing homes, such as the APEHA sen-
ior living apartments in Johnston, Iowa. 
In honoring the Iowa Mask Brigade today, I 
want to underscore the values of hard work, 
dedication, persistence, and problem-solving 
that Iowans demonstrate in spades during this 
difficult time. As Connie Klug said, ‘‘A unique 
characteristic of Iowans is that we don’t get 
defeated easily. We just went to work and 
overcame it. That to me is Iowans: we don’t 
get discouraged; we just get to work. We’re 
not helpless. We rolled up our sleeves and 
said, there are not problems that we can’t fig-
ure out.’’ 
I am so proud to recognize the Iowa Mask 
Brigade for their outstanding work and their 
unwavering willingness to help all those in 
need. It is my hope that other individuals and 
organizations are inspired to take action of 
their own. The volunteers powering the Iowa 
Mask Brigade have not only given protective 
gear to people in need, but also instilled hope 
when we need it most. It is my honor to share 
the Iowa Mask Brigade’s story and recognize 
the group as our Iowan of the Week.

August 7, 2020 
as the Overall AFJROTC and AFA Cadet 
Leadership Award Winner for 2019–2020. 
Cadet Tippy was selected from 890 AFJROTC 
Units and over 125,000 AFJROTC cadets in 
the United States and on military installations 
overseas. The selection process started with 
each unit nominating their top cadet for the 
award. From there, 48 state winners were se-
lected, followed by eight regional winners and 
then finally, one national winner, recognizing 
the most outstanding AFJROTC cadet in the 
world. 
Cadet Tippy has a 4.0 GPA, putting her at 
the top of her graduating class going into her 
senior year, despite a demanding schedule 
with college level courses and an extra-
curricular schedule that includes National 
Honor Society, Student Council, Track, and 
Cross Country. She holds the unit record in 
every category of the AFJROTC Physical Fit-
ness Test, including the mile run, push-ups, 
and crunches. She finished first, from over 
100 female competitors, in two local physical 
fitness competitions with other JROTC units 
from Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri and Mis-
sissippi. 
Earlier in the school year, Cadet Tippy was 
one of only 200 AFJROTC cadets, from over 
3,000 applicants, to be selected to attend the 
AFJROTC Flight Academy, a summer scholar-
ship program valued at over $25,000, which 
allows cadets to earn their private pilot license 
during a 10-week course at a college or uni-
versity. Because of COVID–19, this course 
has been postponed until the summer of 2021. 
She is in the process of applying for the Air 
Force Academy and plans to be an Air Force 
officer and pilot. 
It is obvious to all that read her accolades 
that Cadet Tippy is more than deserving of 
this achievement. I ask my colleagues to join 
me in wishing Cadet Tippy a congratulations.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, as we continue 
to confront the health and economic crises 
presented by COVID–19, Americans are un-
derstandably anxious about the future. I take 
hope in our history of meeting extraordinary 
challenges with new innovations, and I believe 
research and development will be a key part 
in addressing today’s challenges as well. 
Our federal government supports some of 
the brightest and most creative minds in the 
world at America’s colleges and universities 
through research grants administered by the 
National Science Foundation. Particularly in 
this time of economic turmoil, we must ensure 
that we fully capitalize on these research in-
vestments by transitioning scientific discovery 
into tangible products, creating new busi-
nesses for a healthy and prosperous America. 
My amendment highlights the importance of 
programs like the National Science Foundation 
Innovation Corps in facilitating tech transfer. I- 
Corps, as it is known, began in 2011 and uti-
lizes the Lean LaunchPad curriculum devel-
oped by serial entrepreneur Steve Blank to 
train faculty, students, and other researchers 
in entrepreneurship. The immersive experi-
ence requires participants to get out of the lab 
and interview industry leaders and potential 
customers. Researchers gain an improved un-
derstanding of how their work could be further 
applied to meet real needs in our nation. 
These insights improve potential commer-
cialization of their work and influence future 
research directions. 
According to the spring 2019 Innovation 
Corps biennial report, since inception in 2011 
I-Corps has trained 1,315 teams with a total of 
3,745 people. These participants have raised 
rnore than $300 million in follow-on funding 
and created 644 startups. The report high-
lights recent participating teams, including 
Respira Labs, which spun out of the University 
of California Berkley to develop a technology 
incorporating AI to predict chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease attacks; Diligent Robotics, 
which develops robotic equipment that sup-
ports healthcare staff in Texas; and Ecovia 
Renewables, founded at the University of 
Michigan to create compostable alternatives to 
petrochemical polymers found in a variety of 
commercial products. These and many other 
companies are now in existence due to the 
National Science Foundation research funding 
and the training that enabled their founders to 
transition their findings into tangible products 
Americans can use. 
I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations 
Committee for increasing funding for this crit-
ical program in this year’s CJS appropriations 
bill, to a total of $40 million. I encourage my 
colleagues to continue their strong support for 
National Science Foundation university re-
search programs and I-Corps in future budg-
ets.

TRIBUTE TO PRIVATE FIRST 
CLASS BRYAN BALTIERRA, USMC 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to a hero from my 
congressional district, U.S. Marine Corps Pri-
vate 
First 
Class 
(Pfc) 
Bryan 
Baltierra. 
Throughout the history of our republic we have 
asked young men and women to voluntarily 
step forward to guard and protect the free-
doms we hold so dear. Pfc. Baltierra of Co-
rona, California, took that step forward and as-
sumed the duties, responsibilities, and sac-
rifices that are required of all Americans who 
join the finest military in history. Today I ask 
that the House of Representatives honor and 
remember this incredible young man who died 
in service to our country. 
Pfc. Baltierra was born September 18, 2001, 
to Carlos and Evelyn Baltierra. As a child, he 
aspired to serve his country by joining the mili-
tary and after graduating from Centennial High 
School, Bryan achieved his dream. On July 
30, 2019, at the age of only 17, he was sworn 
into the U.S. Marine Corps. After graduating 
from basic training, Bryan was stationed at 
Camp Pendleton where he remained close to 
his family and was able to visit with them. 
Bryan is described as someone who radiated 
positivity, which you can clearly see from his 
bright smile. He shared with his parents and 
sisters how he loved the brotherhood that ac-
companied being a Marine and how he also 
came to enjoy the rigorous training and fitness 
that was required of him. 
On July 30, 2020, exactly one year after he 
was sworn into the Marine Corps, Pfc. 
Baltierra boarded an amphibious assault vehi-
cle for a routine exercise in training for his up-
coming September deployment. The vehicle 
sank off the coast of San Clemente Island, re-
sulting in the death of Pfc. Baltierra, seven 
other marines, and a sailor. 
As we look at the rich history of our country, 
we realize that this history is comprised of 
men and women, just like Pfc. Baltierra, who 
so bravely chose a life of military service. 
Each story is unique and humbling for those of 
us who, far from the dangers they will be 
called to face, live our lives in relative comfort 
and ease. Pfc. Baltierra is survived by his fa-
ther, Carlos, mother, Evelyn, and three sisters, 
Natalie, Emily, and Sara. 
While we send our deepest sympathies to 
his family, there are no words that can ex-
press or alleviate the grief of losing a son and 
brother. Pfc. Baltierra’s parents and sisters 
have given a part of themselves in the loss of 
Bryan. and I hope they know that their son 
and brother, the goodness he brought to this 
world and the sacrifice he has made, will al-
ways be remembered.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LANCE 
CPL. MARCO A. BARRANCO 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to mourn the tragic 
loss of Lance Cpl. Marco A. Barranco from 
Montebello, California. Lance Cpl. Barranco, 
known to his loved ones and friends as 
‘‘Andy,’’ proudly served our country as a 
United States Marine in the 15th Marine Expe-
ditionary Unit based at Camp Pendleton. 
On 
Thursday, 
July 
30th, 
Lance 
Cpl. 
Barranco was training on an amphibious as-
sault vehicle off the coast of San Clemente Is-
land, California. Due to an incident that is still 
under investigation, the vehicle sank hundreds 
of feet into the water. Lance Cpl. Barranco 
and seven other Marines and one Sailor of the 
15th Marine Expeditionary Unit were killed or 
presumed dead. Seven Marines were rescued 
following the incident, two of whom were in-
jured. 
I offer my deepest condolences to Lance 
Cpl. Barranco’s loved ones and friends for 
their heartbreaking loss. He exemplified the 
best of our armed forces and was known to 
his family, friends, and neighbors as an in-
credibly kind man who would do anything to 
help those in need. His sister, Selma, noted 
that he always wanted to serve his country, 
even as a boy when he dressed up like a G.I. 
Joe for Halloween. 
Though Lance Cpl. Barranco was taken be-
fore he had the chance to fully live out the 
promise of his life, he had already fulfilled so 
much of that promise as a rifleman in the 
United States Marine Corps. His passing is a 
loss not just for all who were lucky to know 
him, but for a nation for which he put his life 
on the line. He is survived by his two sisters, 
a niece and an unborn nephew, and both of

painful time.

HONORING HUEY D. JOHNSON 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Huey D. Johnson, who 
passed away on July 12, 2020, at the age of 
87 after an extraordinary lifetime of public 
service to his community and the environment. 
Born in 1933 and raised in rural Michigan, 
Mr. Johnson graduated from Western Michi-
gan University in 1957 with a degree in biol-
ogy. Upon graduation, Mr. Johnson began 
working for Union Carbide where he traveled 
to many places including the San Francisco 
Bay Area. After leaving Union Carbide, he 
worked in Alaska and then obtained a mas-
ter’s degree from Utah State University. Dur-
ing this period, Mr. Johnson’s passion for nat-
ural resources and public land was enhanced. 
Mr. Johnson became the first western re-
gional director for the Nature Conservancy, a 
position he held from 1968 to 1972. Through 
this role he became a champion for sustain-
ability and conservation and a leader in pro-
tecting land from development. In 1972 the 
Nature Conservancy was able to acquire 
2,100 acres of land in the Marin Headlands to 
protect it from a large scale development that 
was to be called Marincello. The land was 
transferred to the National Park Service initi-
ating the creation of what is now the Golden 
Gate National Recreation Area with 82,000 
acres of protected public land. This achieve-
ment is renowned in the region and around 
the county and recorded in the 2012 docu-
mentary, ‘‘Rebel with a Cause.’’ 
In 1971 , Mr. Johnson helped co-found The 
Trust for Public Land to bring the legal and fi-
nancial strategies of modern business to the 
cause of conservation. Today the Trust for 
Public Land is one of the largest environ-
mental organizations of its kind in the country, 
with conservation projects spanning the coun-
try from urban communities to rural areas. 
In 1978, Mr. Johnson was selected by then- 
California Governor Jerry Brown to join his 
cabinet as Secretary of Resources, a position 
he held until Governor Brown left office. As 
Secretary of Resources, Mr. Johnson was the 
driving force behind California’s 100-year sus-
tainability plan, and he earned a reputation for 
living by example, riding his bike to work and 
limiting his impacts on the environment. In 
1982, he established the Resource Renewal 
Institute, a non-profit organization based in Mill 
Valley that focuses on innovation related to 
sustainability. His work with the Resource Re-
newal Institute led to many accomplishments 
including his co-founding of the Grand Canyon 
Trust in 1985. In 1995, Mr. Johnson published 
a book titled ‘‘Green Plans: Blueprint for a 
Sustainable Earth.’’ Among his notable hon-
ors, the United Nations recognized him in 
2001 for his many environmental achieve-
ments 
with 
the 
Sasakawa 
Environment 
Prize—one of the organization’s highest hon-
ors. 
Throughout his life and until his passing, Mr. 
Johnson delivered on his mission to protect, 
preserve, and restore natural landscapes, 
mentored many generations of environmental-
ists, and completed his memoir of his lifetime 
of environmental activism. Mr. Johnson is sur-
vived by his wife of 58 years, Sue; his daugh-
ter Megan; son Tyler and his wife, Jill; 
grandsons Miles and Bay; and nephew, Zack. 
Madam Speaker, Huey Johnson felt like the 
last environmental Titan of his era, a living 
bridge to the bigger-than-life conservationists 
ofthe past century and beyond. I will always 
value my personal relationship with Mr. John-
son. I can attest to his intellectual firepower, 
his gravitas, and the passion he always 
brought to his work, as well as the fact that his 
environmentalism was not just some esoteric 
pursuit. His connection to nature was authen-
tic and included hunting and fishing and ap-
preciating the role of both wild places and 
working landscapes in our collective steward-
ship responsibilities. I am grateful for his leg-
acy, and for the advice and friendship he pro-
vided over many years no matter our occa-
sional differences. While he will be greatly 
missed by so many, Mr. Johnson’s legacy will 
live on through the indelible positive impact he 
had on his community and beyond. Please 
join me in honoring a life well spent and in ex-
tending our respectful condolences to Mr. 
Johnson’s 
many 
colleagues, 
family, 
and 
friends. 
Mr. Johnson has been an inspiration and 
mentor to me personally and to many environ-
mentalists over the years. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of those individuals and many more to 
come, I urge my colleagues to join us in ex-
pressing deep appreciation for Mr. Johnson’s 
many achievements and enduring commitment 
to protecting the environments of Marin and 
Sonoma Counties.

HONORING JOSEPHINE GUTIERREZ 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Ms. Josephine Gutierrez for her 
25 years of service to Natividad Hospital and 
to congratulate her on a well-deserved retire-
ment. Through her dedication and selfless 
service, Ms. Gutierrez has made an immeas-
urable impact on the hospital and our commu-
nities on the central coast of California. 
Ms. Gutierrez began her career in 1995 in 
the Managed Care Department working at the 
Medically Indigent Program (M.I.A) as a Pa-
tient Account Representative I. She worked 
diligently, 
adjudicating 
claims, 
answering 
phones, and completing tasks as assigned. 
On weekends and evenings, she went door-to- 
door, visited farmworkers in the fields, and at-
tended events to educate the community 
about available healthcare programs. With her 
passion and ability to help others, she was 
soon promoted to a Health Education Assist-
ant where she began her work developing 
Outreach, Enrollment, Retention and Utiliza-
tion initiatives that continue to this day at 
Natividad Hospital. 
Throughout her 25 years of service, Ms. 
Gutierrez has collaborated with community 
agencies such as Head Start, Migrant Edu-
cation, American Red Cross, United Farm 
Worker’s Foundation, and local schools to 
successfully identify and enroll families and 
children into affordable-low-cost healthcare 
programs. She also participated in community 
health fairs and events throughout the Salinas 
Valley and-organized monthly forums for the 
Monterey County Immigrant Services Network 
of Empowerment of Monterey County (CISNE) 
that helps immigrant communities access in-
formation and services. 
Ms. Gutierrez’s devotion to her work has re-
sulted in many accomplishments, including 
being selected as Employee of the Quarter 
twice. However, one achievement she is most 
proud of is enrolling thousands of children and 
families into affordable health programs, giving 
them access to quality healthcare and pre-
ventative services. This work has resulted in a 
healthier and more equitable community and 
will undoubtably impact the lives and health of 
generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, please join me thanking 
Ms. Josephine Gutierrez for a lifetime of serv-
ice to our communities on the Central Coast. 
I have no doubt that she will continue to find 
ways to positively impact the lives of those 
around her in retirement.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
YOUNG 
AMERICANS 
FINANCIAL 
LIT-
ERACY ACT 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 7, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I am pleased to re-introduce the Young 
Americans Financial Literacy Act. Financial lit-
eracy is critical to ensuring future financial re-
sponsibility. Studies have shown that 88 per-
cent of Americans believe finance education 
should be taught in schools and 92 percent of 
K–12 teachers believe that financial education 
should be taught in school, but only 12 per-
cent of teachers actually teach the subject. 
Yet, according to a 2020 survey, less than half 
of states require high school students to take 
a personal finance course, and less than 17 
percent of high school students were required 
to take a semester long personal finance 
course. 
I believe that Congress has an opportunity 
and a responsibility to address the pressing 
needs of individuals faced with the loss of 
their financial stability and the challenges of 
economic uncertainty. This should include fi-
nancial literacy education reform and long- 
term solutions to prevent future personal finan-
cial disasters. Research-based financial lit-
eracy education programs are needed to 
reach individuals at all ages and socio-
economic levels, particularly those facing 
unique and challenging financial situations, 
such as high school graduates entering the 
workforce, soon-to-be and recent college grad-
uates, young families, and to address the 
unique needs of military personnel and their 
families. High school and college students 
who are exposed to cumulative financial edu-
cation show an increase in financial knowl-
edge, which in turn drives increasingly respon-
sible behavior as they become young adults.

Office, giving Americans the information they

need to make effective financial decisions can 
be key to their well-being and to the country’s 
economic health. The global financial crisis, 
when many borrowers failed to fully under-
stand the risks associated with certain finan-
cial products and currently, the economic 
hardships presented by the sudden disruptions 
caused by the spread of COVID–19, under-
score the need to improve individuals’ financial 
literacy and empower all Americans to make 
informed financial decisions. This is especially 
true for young people as they are earning their 
first paychecks, securing student aid, and es-
tablishing their financial independence. There-
fore, focusing economic education and finan-
cial literacy efforts and best practices for 
young people between the ages of 8–24 is of 
utmost importance. 
I believe America should be leading the 
world with the best-educated students who will 
drive our economic innovation and success, 
so please join me in cosponsoring the Young 
Americans Financial Literacy Act. This act: 
Establishes a grant program in the Bureau 
of Consumer Financial protection to develop 
and implement financial literacy programs for 
young people ages eight to twenty-four; 
Incentivizes the development of partnerships 
between institutions or higher education, local 
educational agencies, non-profit organizations, 
and financial institutions to develop programs 
aimed at young Americans in different phases 
of their life; 
Ensures the development of evidence-based 
instructional material that is geared towards 
targeted groups and addresses unique life sit-
uations, including bankruptcy, foreclosure, stu-
dent loans, credit card misuse; and 
Conducts ongoing assessment and account-
ability of the program over the short- and long- 
term to ensure that grand money achieves the 
greatest impact. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the Young Americans Financial Lit-
eracy Act.
