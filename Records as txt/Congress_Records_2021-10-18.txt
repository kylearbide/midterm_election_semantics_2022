Let us pray. 
Eternal God, the center of our joy, 
give our lawmakers this day the cre-
ativity and wisdom to solve problems 
and facilitate faith. As they seek to 
keep our Nation strong, provide them 
with the long view of their work. Lord,

timately fail. Bless them with humil-
ity, integrity, and compassion for the 
living of these days. 
And, Lord, thank You for the exem-

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

nized. 
REMEMBERING COLIN POWELL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
today, we learned that America has 
lost a trailblazing leader with the pass-
ing of Colin Powell. 
It 
is 
hard 
to 
imagine 
a 
more 
quintessentially American story: A son 
of Jamaican immigrants who learned 
Yiddish from his boyhood neighbors in 
the Bronx becomes a four-star general 
in the U.S. Army and serves four Presi-
dential administrations, including as 
National Security Advisor, the young-
est ever Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, and the first Black Secretary 
of State. 
As a young officer, General Powell 
rendered brave and distinguished serv-
ice on the frontlines. As a senior lead-
er, he helped four Presidents protect 
our Nation, represent us on the world 
stage, and chart our course through un-
certain and turbulent times that in-
cluded the dawn of a new century and 
the beginning of our global war on ter-
rorists, who will not leave America 
alone even if we leave them alone. 
Today, we remember and honor a 
man who truly dedicated his entire life 
to serving his country. 
THE ECONOMY 
Madam President, now on an entirely 
different matter, there is a famous say-
ing: If you find yourself in a hole, the 
first thing to do is to stop digging. 
Well, my Democratic colleagues’ policy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7020 
October 18, 2021 
decisions have dug our economy into a 
deep hole, and American families des-
perately need them to stop digging. 
Families of this country are cur-
rently battling the worst inflation in 
well over a decade. Over the last 12 
months, consumer prices have shot up 
by 5.4 percent. Gasoline prices and food 
prices each increased by a full 1.2 per-
cent just last month alone. That is just 
in 1 month. Year on year, groceries are 
about 4.5 percent more expensive than 
they were at this time in 2020. Let’s 
look at housing. Rent jumped a full 
half a percentage point just in Sep-
tember alone. That was the biggest 
monthly jump in two decades. 
On paper, American workers have 
been getting raises. The average work-
er’s paychecks have gotten bigger over 
the last year, but the Democrats’ infla-
tion has cannibalized all those gains 
and then some. Any man or woman in 
the country who hasn’t gotten a pay 
raise of 5.5 percent this year has effec-
tively had their pay cut by the Demo-
crats’ inflation. 
Let me say it again: Unless you have 
recently gotten a 5.5-percent raise, you 
have gotten a pay cut. And even the 
households that have enjoyed pay 
raises are contending with major short-
ages of the things they want to buy and 
rapid and unpredictable price changes. 
Of course, none of the families we 
represent need to hear these figures 
from experts on the news; they are liv-
ing this reality every time they need to 
swing by the store, fill up their tank, 
or grab some essentials. 
What is especially remarkable and 
especially sad is that our Nation’s in-
flation nightmare was not unavoidable. 
These conditions are the product of in-
tentional policy decisions made by 
Democrats over the objection of ex-
perts who warned exactly—exactly— 
what would happen. 
Larry Summers, a leading economist 
and top adviser to each of the last two 
Democratic Presidents, said a few days 
ago—just a few days ago—‘‘We’re in 
more danger than we’ve been during 
my career of losing control of inflation 
in the U.S.’’ That is Larry Summers, 
just a couple of days ago. The worst in-
flation risk he has ever seen? Mr. Sum-
mers was one of the many mainstream 
economists who warned the Biden ad-
ministration what their policies would 
unleash. From the start, they tried to 
persuade 
Democrats 
not 
to 
ram 
through their historic glut of bor-
rowing, printing, and spending. Ah, but 
alas, Democrats didn’t listen. Back in 
the springtime, they used the pandemic 
as an excuse to pass a massive spending 
bill that the White House boasted was 
the most leftwing legislation in Amer-
ican history. Now families are paying 
the painful price. 
The country is deep in this hole that 
Democrats dug, but they are showing 
no indication—none—that they want to 
stop digging. Led by our socialist col-
league, the distinguished Senator from 
Vermont, Chairman SANDERS, Wash-
ington Democrats are plowing forward 
with yet another reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree that would make their 
huge inflationary package from the 
springtime look like child’s play by 
comparison. They want the govern-
ment to borrow and print multiple tril-
lions more dollars and dump all that 
spending onto the heads of families 
who 
are 
already 
struggling—strug-
gling—to stay afloat. 
Meanwhile, Democrats want to sad-
dle a sputtering economy with the big-
gest peacetime tax hikes on record, ob-
literating President Biden’s promise 
not to raise taxes for the vast majority 
of 
American 
families 
and 
leaving 
American job creators with tougher 
tax rates than businesses pay in com-
munist China. 
Look at energy prices. Americans are 
already paying more at the pump than 
they have in 7 years, but now our col-
leagues want to go beyond their war on 
gasoline and slap new taxes and new 
regulations on other domestic energy 
sources such as natural gas. But winter 
is fast approaching. The whole world is 
steeling for huge price increases in nat-
ural gas. Our friends in Europe are 
frantically trying to secure their gas 
supply lines, and Russia is threatening 
to turn the continent’s winter heating 
into 
a 
political 
hostage. 
But, 
inexplicably, Democrats’ response is 
essentially to have America stand 
down as an energy superpower—new 
taxes and new regulations on top of the 
inflation that is already wreaking 
havoc. 
Here was one headline last week: 
Winter heating bills set to jump as infla-
tion hits home. 
The story went on: 
With prices surging worldwide for heating 
oil, natural gas and other fuels, the U.S. gov-
ernment said Wednesday it expects house-
holds to see their heating bills jump as much 
as 54% compared to last winter. 
This is the moment that President 
Biden is choosing to let the farthest- 
left people in Washington, DC, rewrite 
America’s energy and environmental 
policy. Reckless liberal policies have 
dug America into a hole. Americans 
need Democrats to stop digging deeper, 
but the response from my colleagues 
across the aisle is to trade in their 
shovels for an excavator. Democrats 
want to keep digging deeper. They 
want to try to inflate their way out of 
inflation. 
It makes no sense whatsoever. It 
sounds as crazy as it is. No wonder this 
expensive socialist experiment is prov-
ing so very painful. It is not what 
American voters elected, and it is not 
what American families want. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
REMEMBERING COLIN POWELL 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, like 
so many others in the Senate across 
America, I was saddened to learn this 
morning of the passing of Colin Powell. 
In his lifetime, he broke down so 
many barriers, and he held some of the 
most important titles in this great Na-
tion: General of the U.S. Army, Na-
tional 
Security 
Adviser, 
America’s 
first Black Joint Chiefs of Staff, and 
our first Black Secretary of State. 
But before he held any of those posi-
tions, and after he stepped away from 
them, Colin Powell was always a pa-
triot and a public servant. He was the 
son of immigrants—Jamaican immi-
grants—who raised their children to 
make the most of every opportunity 
that America offered and to show their 
gratitude to this Nation by giving— 
giving back however they could. 
That story of opportunity and obliga-
tion is a story told by every immigrant 
parent to their children. It is the same 
story my mother taught to me and my 
brothers. 
Much has been said and written 
about Colin Powell’s historic and dis-
tinguished career as a soldier and a 
statesman. He was respected in a way 
that transcended partisan labels. 
He wasn’t perfect. His speech in 2003 
to the U.N. General Assembly claimed 
incorrectly that Iraq likely possessed 
weapons of mass destruction. It was 
based on information he was given and 
later learned to be false. It helped 
make a case for a war about which he 
had misgivings, and he would come to 
regret those remarks the rest of his 
life. 
But he never stopped trying to serve, 
even after leaving public office. In 2010, 
Colin Powell spoke out publicly about 
a cause that is deeply personal to many 
people, including myself. He and other 
military leaders urged this Senate to 
pass the Dream Act—legislation that 
would give young immigrants who 
grew up in the United States a chance 
to earn their citizenship. 
Who better could speak to that issue 
than Colin Powell, the son of immi-
grants who served this Nation with dis-
tinction and combat and in public serv-
ice? Regrettably, at the time, while a 
majority of Senators supported the 
Dream Act, it was filibustered and did 
not pass. Still, tens of thousands of im-
migrants are risking their lives today 
defending 
our 
Nation 
in 
uniform. 
Among them may very well be another 
Colin Powell. 
It would be a fitting tribute to Sec-
retary Powell for us to pass immigra-
tion reform now—this year—and recog-
nize what a great patriot and son of 
immigrants like Colin Powell brought 
to this Nation. 
One last point. Colin Powell survived 
one form of cancer nearly 20 years ago. 
He was being treated for another when 
he passed away. Multiple myeloma, a 
form of blood cancer, weakens the im-
mune system. So despite the fact that 
he was fully vaccinated, General Pow-
ell died of complications of COVID.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7021 
October 18, 2021 
It is sad and ironic that a man who 
spent so much of his life defending oth-
ers from danger, in the end, died from 
a common enemy that too many of our 
fellow citizens continue to deny, thus 
giving the virus an opportunity to rep-
licate and wreak havoc. We are not 
each other’s enemies; the virus is the 
enemy. 
Today, it claimed the life of an 
American statesman. By this time to-
morrow, it will have taken another 
1,500 family members, neighbors, he-
roes to many. 
Especially for young children who 
can’t be vaccinated yet and for the mil-
lions of Americans with compromised 
immune systems, we really have to in-
crease our vaccine rates. 
CONGRATULATING THE CHICAGO SKY 
Madam President, last night, the 
world discovered that in Chicago, the 
sky is the limit. Our city of Chicago is 
home to a new team of champions. 
During the Women’s National Bas-
ketball Association finals at Wintrust 
Arena, the Chicago Sky mounted a 
comeback for the ages. In the fourth 
quarter, the team overcame an 11-point 
deficit to claim their first-ever cham-
pionship title. The victory was the cul-
mination of a historic season. Their 
record in the regular season was a me-
diocre 16 and 16, but in the runup for 
the playoffs, the Chicago Sky won 8 
postseason games, an alltime record for 
the WNBA. And from start to finish, 
last night’s victory was truly a team 
effort. 
Hometown 
hero 
Candace 
Parker 
scored 16 points—she is nothing short 
of amazing—including a three-pointer 
that tied the game with less than 2 
minutes left, sending the arena into an 
uproar. Kahleah Copper was named the 
WNBA finals MVP. Allie Quigley, a Jo-
liet native, scored 26 points, and her 
wife and fellow teammate, Courtney 
Vandersloot, finished the game with 15 
assists. 
All-around, last night’s victory was a 
legendary feat for the Chicago Sky. To-
morrow, our city will celebrate our 
new hometown champs in Millennium 
Park. 
I want to thank every member of the 
Chicago Sky for making Skytown 
proud, especially Michael Alter and 
John Rogers, two personal friends who 
brought the franchise to Chicago and 
have worked diligently to make it the 
best every step of the way. Last night, 
they did. It is an inspiration to our city 
and to all the young players every-
where who want to look to a team that 
proves you should never quit. 
NOMINATION OF GUSTAVO A. GELPI 
Finally, Madam President, today the 
Senate will vote to confirm Gustavo 
Gelpi to serve on the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the First Circuit. 
Judge Gelpi is a highly qualified ju-
rist who has two decades of experience 
on the bench. When confirmed, he will 
be only the second judge of Hispanic 
origin and the second judge from Puer-
to Rico to serve on the First Circuit. 
I would like to take just a moment to 
discuss his extensive qualifications and 
experience. 
Throughout 
his 
career, 
Judge Gelpi has dedicated himself to 
public service. Prior to his appoint-
ment to the bench, he gained a keen 
understanding of the need for fairness 
and impartiality in our system of jus-
tice. He worked as a public defender as 
well as prosecutor. He served in the 
Puerto Rican Department of Justice, 
where he handled criminal matters on 
behalf of the attorney general of Puer-
to Rico. 
In 2001, Judge Gelpi was selected to 
serve as magistrate judge for the Dis-
trict of Puerto Rico. Five years later, 
his impressive judicial record caught 
the attention of President George W. 
Bush, who nominated him to serve as 
district judge for the District of Puerto 
Rico. With Senate Republicans in the 
majority, Judge Gelpi’s nomination re-
ceived unanimous support in both the 
Senate Judiciary Committee and on 
the floor of the Senate. 
Having served as a Federal judge for 
20 years, Judge Gelpi is eminently 
qualified to sit on the First Circuit. He 
has already presided over 3,400 cases, 62 
jury trials, and issued almost 900 writ-
ten opinions. 
He is a real judge. He is well versed 
in both complex and civil criminal 
matters and was rated unanimously 
‘‘well qualified’’ by the American Bar 
Association. 
Judge Gelpi’s nomination is yet an-
other example of the Biden administra-
tion and Senate Democrats working to 
advance judicial nominees to bring pro-
fessional and demographic diversity to 
the Federal bench. The fact that Judge 
Gelpi has been nominated by both Re-
publican and Democratic Presidents is 
almost historic and is certainly a tes-
tament to his evenhandedness and fi-
delity to the rule of law. Leaders on 
both sides of the aisle trust that he 
will rule impartially and without re-
gard for partisanship. 
Once he is confirmed as only the sec-
ond judge of Hispanic origin to serve on 
the First Circuit, Judge Gelpi will help 
build a Federal bench that truly re-
flects the diversity of America. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
Judge Gelpi’s nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
earlier this month, Attorney General 
Garland released a memo instructing 
Department of Justice employees to re-
spond to increasingly passionate school 
board meetings across the country. 
That memo talks about working to 
stop the violence and the threats of vi-
olence. That part of it is very fine, but 
unfortunately the memo makes it 
sound like the Department of Justice 
might want to go after much more 
than just violence. 
Over the last year, school board 
meetings have turned from relatively 
calm, local affairs to often boisterous 
meetings that are seen across the coun-
try. This began with parents who were 
upset after schools were being closed 
last year well after we learned that 
they could safely reopen in spite of 
COVID–19. Then these meetings grew 
to include pushback against mask 
mandates for students and against 
school districts adopting a curriculum 
known as critical race theory. 
There are many parents across the 
country who are upset about these 
things, and that is their right, to be 
upset about them and to talk about 
them all they want to—after all, free-
dom of speech, freedom of assembly. 
So here is the issue. The Attorney 
General’s memo spoke of violence and 
threats of violence. Make no mistake 
about it—violence should never be used 
to get what you want in politics. It is 
illegal for a good reason, and making 
real, true threats is illegal as well. 
They scare people, and that is not 
right. No one should ever threaten 
someone with violence just because 
they are angry about some school pol-
icy. 
Unfortunately, however, the Depart-
ment of Justice memo goes further 
than that. A person reading it might 
think that a parent can’t speak—really 
speak his or her mind at a school board 
meeting; that spirited debate is not 
welcome; that very pointed and direct 
questions from educators to school 
board members aren’t welcome; that 
deep disagreements are not welcome. 
Parents coming and speaking to their 
local school boards is what our democ-
racy is all about—the essence of our 
representative system of government. 
Whether it is Congress, State legisla-
tures, city hall, or school boards, we 
ought to be able to have civil discus-
sion, and nobody ought to question 
that civil discussion. 
Of course, democracy also includes 
very passionate disagreements. If an 
elected official can’t handle a pas-
sionate disagreement, then he or she 
shouldn’t go into politics in the first 
place. That goes for the President; that 
goes for this Senator; and that goes for 
every member on every school board in 
the country. 
Elected officials don’t go crying to 
the FBI when constituents tell them 
something—how they are really feeling 
on an issue—regardless of how strong 
that feeling might be. 
If a parent is passionately advocating 
for her child at a school board meeting 
and school officials tell her she is out 
of line, the parent should not have to 
worry that the FBI is going to pay her 
a visit in her home after that meeting. 
She should not have to wonder 
whether the PATRIOT Act is going to 
be used to investigate her. It should 
never even cross that person’s mind. If

it does, then she might just stop talk-
ing altogether at a meeting, and there 
would be a chilling effect on democ-
racy. 
That chilling effect is a very bad 
thing for democracies. In other words, 
it should never happen in the first 
place. So it is critically important for 
the Attorney General to make very 
clear to everybody that, short of vio-
lence and making true threats of vio-
lence, the Federal Government will 
have nothing to do with the crowds and 
the comments that people make at a 
school board meeting. 
All of my Republican colleagues on 
the Senate Judiciary Committee and I 
sent a letter to the Attorney General 
telling him just that. He should make 
clear to all Americans that, unless 
there is physical violence or a threat of 
physical violence, Federal law enforce-
ment has nothing to do with local 
school board meetings; and he ought to 
take into consideration the capability 
of local law enforcement to take care 
of it in the first place. 
BIOFUELS 
Madam President, on another sub-
ject, I would like to speak to an issue 
that is hurting the pocketbooks of 
hard-working Americans, particularly 
in the State of Iowa. 
The media has reported that the 
White House has been in discussions 
with Big Oil regarding rising fuel 
prices. This is quite a surprise to some 
of us who have heard nothing from the 
administration all year; that we have 
got to stop fossil fuels and we have got 
to worry more about global warming. 
We shouldn’t stop Big Oil, but you still 
have got to worry about global warm-
ing. 
President Biden has called on OPEC 
cartels to drill for additional crude oil 
and discussed potentially opening up 
our domestic Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve. With rising energy prices, it is 
commonsense to promote additional 
development of energy; but with the 
Biden 
administration’s 
sole 
focus 
seemingly being on climate change, I 
would think more attention would be 
paid to promoting an emphasis upon 
clean energy. 
Throughout my tenure in the Senate, 
I have promoted alternative energy 
sources as a way of protecting our en-
vironment and increasing our energy 
independence. As the No. 1 producer of 
corn, ethanol, and biodiesel, Iowa leads 
the Nation’s renewable fuels industry. 
But if the President doesn’t care 
about Iowa—my State of Iowa—the 
President should remember the States 
of Illinois and Minnesota, just as an ex-
ample. Historically, blue States are 
also major producers of corn and soy-
beans, as well as ethanol and biodiesel. 
A recent study has shown the ex-
panded use of ethanol under the renew-
able fuel standard has lowered gasoline 
prices by an average of 22 cents per gal-
lon. This saves the typical American 
household $250 annually. In recent 
weeks, E–10, which is a 10-percent mix-
ture of ethanol and gasoline, has sold 
for 35 cents to 50 cents per gallon less 
than gasoline with no ethanol. 
Not 
only 
is 
ethanol-blended 
gas 
cheaper than non-ethanol gasoline, but 
a recent study has also shown that eth-
anol reduces greenhouse gas emissions 
by 43 percent compared to conventional 
gasoline. 
Considering President Biden’s sudden 
interest in high gasoline prices, a com-
monsense solution would be to turn to 
the biofuel industry for assistance in 
this time of high gasoline prices. 
Enhancing energy security while low-
ering emissions was the exact reason 
why Congress created the renewable 
fuel standard in 2005 and 2007. The Mid-
west has the potential to provide a so-
lution to the multifaceted problems 
that this administration faces. 
Instead, President Biden and his 
White House continue—it seems to 
me—to turn to Big Oil to solve the en-
ergy crisis instead of looking at the re-
newable fuels opportunities. Big Oil 
seems to then have a friendly relation-
ship with the White House, which is 
completely contrary to what you would 
think of when they want to do away 
with fossil fuels. 
Recent rumors in the press are say-
ing that the administration is consid-
ering gutting the renewable fuel stand-
ard with massive cuts to the required 
volume obligations. This is strange 
considering 
President 
Biden 
cam-
paigned on supporting the renewable 
fuel standard. He campaigned in Iowa 
as a friend of ethanol—yes, in Iowa. 
President Biden said that ‘‘the Re-
newable Fuel Standard marks our bond 
with our farmers and our commitment 
to a thriving rural economy.’’ 
Increased drilling for crude oil and 
increasing our dependence on OPEC is 
not a solution to higher prices at the 
pumps. 
Why ask OPEC to pump more oil? 
Why ask Big Oil to pump more oil? 
Americans need relief, and that relief 
can come from having a partnership 
with the biofuels industry, and it is 
past time for the administration to 
look to the heartland instead of Texas 
and OPEC for an answer. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING COLIN POWELL 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
begin today with the news that General 
Colin Powell, who served our Nation as 
the first African-American Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
first African-American Secretary of 
State, passed away this morning at 84. 
General Powell leaves behind a dis-
tinguished trailblazing legacy. Born in 
Harlem to Jamaican parents, he grew 
up with a sister and his parents in 
South Bronx. He graduated from Mel-
rose High School in the Bronx in 1954. 
At City College, his life changed for-
ever when he joined the school’s ROTC 
program, quickly becoming a standout 
member and earning his commission as 
Second Lieutenant in the Army after 
graduation. 
From humble beginnings, General 
Powell’s career broke one glass ceiling 
after another. His life was a manifesta-
tion of the American dream, a true 
American success story. 
I join all Americans in remembering 
General Powell’s life and his dedication 
to the country we love. 
My thoughts are with his wife Alma, 
his three children, and his entire fam-
ily. 
SENATE AGENDA 
Madam President, we begin a con-
sequential work period for the U.S. 
Senate. Later today, we are going to 
move forward on the nomination of 
Gustavo Gelpi to serve on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
If confirmed today, I believe Judge 
Gelpi will be only the second American 
citizen from Puerto Rico to be ap-
pointed to that court in its history. I 
cannot think of a better individual to 
succeed the late Judge Torruella. 
Judge Gelpi is a proven champion of 
civil rights and a defender of the rule 
of law. He began his career in Puerto 
Rico’s office as a Federal defender. In 
2006, he was unanimously confirmed as 
a district judge for Puerto Rico. 
He brings both personal and profes-
sional diversity to the bench at a time 
when we desperately need both. I am 
proud to have championed his nomina-
tion, and look forward to his confirma-
tion today. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Madam President, on voting rights, 
this week, the Senate will have an op-
portunity to engage in a momentous 
and urgent debate protecting the right 
to vote in free and fair elections. 
Later this evening, I will begin the 
process for the Senate to consider the 
Freedom to Vote Act, a powerful new 
bill designed to fortify our democracy, 
protect the vote, and renew the Amer-
ican people’s trust in our elections. 
After I file cloture tonight on the mo-
tion to proceed, Members can expect 
the vote to take place on Wednesday. 
The Freedom to Vote Act is a bal-
anced, effective, and commonsense bill. 
It sets basic standards for all Ameri-
cans to vote safely and securely, while 
protecting elections from subversion. 
It fights back against the power of Big 
Money 
and 
ends 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering, while respecting the role of 
States in carrying out elections. 
The bill represents the first time 
every single Senate Democrat has 
united on voting rights legislation. It 
is a strong bill. It advances election re-
forms proven to work in red, blue, and 
purple States across the country. 
I thank my colleagues—all of my col-
leagues—for the work in putting this

bill together. I thank them for their 
dedication in advancing the simple 
idea that all Americans, no matter 
what ZIP Code they live in, should 
have the freedom to vote safely and se-
curely. I want to particularly thank 
Senator MANCHIN, who has led the way 
in finding common ground with our Re-
publican colleagues on this proposal. 
It is now time for us to move forward 
on this legislation as promised. 
Now, just so we are all clear, the vote 
that will happen on Wednesday is a 
procedural vote to begin debate on the 
bill. Voting yes does not mean signing 
on any policy or bill text; it is, rather, 
an invitation for Senators to come to 
the table to debate, to deliberate, and 
to compromise, just as the Senate was 
meant to do. 
If there is anything worthy of debate 
in this Chamber, it should be pro-
tecting and strengthening our democ-
racy. With everything we are seeing at 
the State level, the Senate must take 
action, and we must take action now. 
The right to vote is the beating heart 
of any democracy. 
I know we can vote to protect our 
elections and empower all Americans 
to have their voices heard. I hope we 
can do so together across the aisle. I 
implore my Republican colleagues to 
come to the table and work with us on 
this issue. I implore them to turn away 
from spurious claims of the Big Lie 
that are degrading faith in our democ-
racy. 
I know many of my colleagues agree 
in their heart of hearts that we cannot 
allow our democracy to fall victim to 
conspiracy theories, subversion, and 
disinformation, but they must join us 
in working towards solutions. To be 
sure, Senate Democrats don’t expect 
that our Republican colleagues will 
agree with every idea we have on vot-
ing rights. We know the disagreements 
run deep. But in this Chamber, Sen-
ators should not run away from debat-
ing the things we disagree about. If our 
Republican colleagues have good ideas, 
we are ready to work in good faith to 
listen to them, to consider them, and if 
they are aligned with the goals of this 
bill, to include them in the final text. 
But for any of that to happen, our Re-
publican colleagues must agree to 
come to the table first. They should 
agree to let the Senate begin debate. 
That is all this first vote is. It says: 
Are we willing to debate voting rights, 
sacred and important in our democ-
racy? 
It is not acceptable to simply turn 
away from debating voting rights, to 
act as if the Congress has no role to 
play in the defense of free and fair elec-
tions and simply pretend like there is 
nothing malicious afoot at the State 
level. No, inaction is not an option. 
The clock is ticking—the clock is tick-
ing—for this Chamber to do something 
to protect our democracy before these 
dangerous laws take root for the next 
election. The Senate can rise to the 
task if given the chance, but it must be 
allowed to begin its work first. 
Republicans, later this week, will 
have a chance to go on record and show 
if they believe that protecting our de-
mocracy is worthy of this Chamber’s 
attention. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Madam President, finally, a quick 
BBB update. This week, Senate Demo-
crats continue our work on finalizing 
our Build Back Better agenda. Con-
gress, right now, has the best chance in 
years to make meaningful investments 
to help American families climb up to 
the middle class and stay in the middle 
class. 
By passing both the Build Back Bet-
ter Act and the infrastructure bill, we 
can improve our Nation’s crumbling in-
frastructure, create good-paying jobs 
for this century, and lower costs and 
cut taxes for American families, while 
taking overdue steps to meaningfully 
address the climate crisis. It is a dif-
ficult task, but we are committed to 
getting it done. 
Over the last week and weekend, I 
held many productive conversations 
with my colleagues here in the Senate, 
with Speaker PELOSI, and with the 
White House. We still have work to do. 
We all know that in order to pass 
meaningful legislation, we must put 
aside our differences and find common 
ground within our party. As with any 
bill of such historic proportions, not 
every Member will get everything he or 
she wants, but at the end of the day, we 
will pass legislation that dramatically 
improves the lives of the American 
people. We will continue to make 
progress and keep working until the 
job is done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, less 
than a month ago, President Biden 
made 
a 
surprising 
statement—or 
maybe I should say, another surprising 
statement. He said: My Build Back 
Better agenda costs zero dollars—zero 
dollars. That is a big, you might even 
say unbelievable claim. 
For starters, half of his agenda is a 
trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that 
will increase the deficit by more than 
$250 billion over 10 years. The other 
part is a multitrillion-dollar tax-and- 
spending spree, which leans on dam-
aging tax hikes to cover a long list of 
social welfare programs to make the 
United States of America look more 
like, say, a European social welfare 
state. Now, how could that possibly 
cost zero dollars? Well, the answer is 
pretty simple: It can’t. Even the Wash-
ington Post fact checkers gave this 
claim two Pinocchios. 
This strategy of misleading, mis-
stating, and—I hate to say it, but there 
is no other word for it—downright 
lying to the American people is a tried- 
and-true strategy of the Biden adminis-
tration. Whether it is advancing legis-
lation or dodging a crisis, there is no 
promise that is too big to make, even if 
it is patently false. 
Another example. Dating back to the 
campaign trail, President Biden has re-
peatedly promised the American peo-
ple: If you make over $400,000 a year— 
excuse me—if you make under $400,000 
a year, you will not pay more income 
tax. Well, we have heard the same talk-
ing points from the Treasury Sec-
retary, 
Secretary 
Yellen, 
and 
the 
White House Press Secretary dutifully 
comes out and parrots the same posi-
tion again and again and again. It is al-
most as if, if you say something often 
enough, people will begin to believe it 
even if it is not true. 
Considering the enormous amounts 
of spending that the Biden administra-
tion has promised, I understand why 
they are a little worried about the 
truth. All of us like free stuff, whether 
it is a free T-shirt at a football game or 
free samples at a grocery store. What 
folks don’t like, though, is learning 
that they are being played and that 
they are still paying but maybe by dif-
ferent means. So when it comes to free 
college, free childcare, and other free 
programs 
under 
President 
Biden’s 
agenda, most people realize there is no 
such thing as a free lunch. Somebody 
somewhere is going to have to pay for 
it, even if it is borrowed money. The 
next generation, like our pages here, 
when they enter the workforce, they 
are going to be the ones who have to 
pay that money back. Somebody is 
going to have to pay it back. There is 
no such thing as free. 
Contrary to the promises made by 
President Biden and his administra-
tion, the middle class will help to foot 
the bill for this spending bonanza. An 
analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation found that many 
families will see their taxes increase 
under President Biden’s Build Back 
Better agenda. 
In 2023, 2 years from now, 18 percent 
of those earning between $75,000 and 
$100,000 will pay more in taxes, not 
$400,000 or more. More than a third of 
the folks earning between $100,000 and 
$200,000 a year will see a tax increase, 
not people making $400,000 or more. If 
this trend continues into 2027, well 
over half of taxpayers earning between 
$75,000 and $100,000 will pay more in 
taxes. And a whopping 86 percent of 
folks earning between $100,000 and 
$200,000 will see a tax increase. 
Now, you might wonder, how can the 
President have it so wrong? This is not 
news to President Biden. He knows bet-
ter. He is surrounded by world-class 
economic advisers, analysts, and tax 
experts who scrutinize and scrub every 
single policy before it comes to see the 
light of day. Yet, you might wonder, 
why does the President persist in 
claiming that his tax hikes won’t im-
pact the middle class even as he is try-
ing to slip them a massive tax bill? I 
hate to state the obvious, but it is just 
dishonest. 
Of course, all of this comes at a time 
when many family budgets are already 
underwater, struggling to recover from 
the fiscal impact of COVID–19. Now, 
from gas stations, to grocery stores, to 
electricity bills and restaurant checks,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7024 
October 18, 2021 
the American people are being pum-
meled by inflation, paying more for the 
things they used to pay less for. 
What is the Biden administration’s 
response? Well, the President’s Chief of 
Staff, Ron Klain, dismissed inflation as 
something he called a high-class prob-
lem, which I guess means that only 
rich people are suffering or experience 
that inflation. Again, this is clearly 
not true. My constituents in Texas 
don’t see it that way. They see infla-
tion outpacing their wage increases 
and essentially giving them a pay cut. 
They are paying 10 percent more at the 
butcher counter than they were a year 
ago and 42 percent more on gasoline. If 
you are a senior operating on a fixed 
income, you have to spend more of that 
fixed income to end up with less. 
So, no, this isn’t just a problem for 
the high class. Unfortunately, it is not 
going away soon either. You remember 
when concerns were raised with the 
Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell, 
about inflation, and he said: Well, it is 
probably only transitory—meaning it 
is a passing moment. Well, now we see 
that economists expect inflation rates 
to remain steady through the end of 
next year, which would mark the long-
est period of inflation above 5 percent 
in three decades. So if inflation is at 5 
percent, that means you are having to 
pay $1.05 to get what you used to pay $1 
for, and it is compounded each year. 
While inflation is expected to ease 
some—or at least we are hoping and 
praying that is the effect—by the mid-
dle of next year, rates are still likely 
to be higher than they were before the 
pandemic. 
Folks who can’t afford to fill up their 
gas tanks to get back and forth to 
work or buy what they need at the gro-
cery store don’t need to be told that 
things are just fine when they know 
they are not. The American people 
need to see real leadership here that 
addresses the root causes of inflation, 
not pouring gas on that inflation as the 
$31⁄2 trillion reckless tax-and-spending 
spree would do. It would just create 
more money chasing the same goods 
and services, driving prices up. And the 
American people certainly deserve bet-
ter than false statements that ignore 
the magnitude of their pain. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Madam President, as I have said be-
fore, we have seen this playbook again 
and again. Following an objectively 
chaotic exit from Afghanistan because 
of the President’s arbitrary decision 
date, President Biden called the mis-
sion an extraordinary success. Well, we 
know that is not true. We can see that 
with our own eyes. We know that 13 
brave servicemembers lost their lives 
in a terrorist attack, including a young 
marine named David Espinoza, whose 
funeral my wife and I attended in La-
redo, TX. 
Countless Americans and Afghan al-
lies were left behind. We heard from 
the State Department today that they 
can’t even tell us how many Afghans, 
who qualify for the special immigrant 
visa, remain in Afghanistan, and we 
know now, with the Taliban in control, 
that they are hunting down people who 
worked with the United States during 
the last 20 years in order to prevent an-
other terrorist attack like we experi-
enced on 9/11/2001. And, no, the new 
Taliban is not better or a kinder, 
gentler version of the old Taliban. 
So in no way could this be considered 
a success, let alone an extraordinary 
one. 
And then there is the border. Ever 
since President Biden became Presi-
dent, his administration has either ig-
nored, downplayed, or denied the hu-
manitarian crisis at our border. For 
months, the administration wouldn’t 
even talk about it; and when it did, 
there were very peculiar rules that ap-
plied, apparently, to how it should be 
discussed. 
The administration refused to use 
the term ‘‘crisis’’ and came up with a 
range of euphemisms to downplay what 
was actually happening. They called it 
a challenge, a situation, a mess—all to, 
apparently, deceive the American peo-
ple into thinking that what you are 
seeing with your own eyes is not really 
a problem. 
The Secretary of Homeland Security 
took this deception to a whole new 
level recently. When testifying before a 
House committee last week, Secretary 
Mayorkas said the border is ‘‘no less 
secure than it was previously.’’ 
That is demonstrably false. The data 
tells a very clearly different story. 
In the first 7 months of the Biden ad-
ministration, more than 1.2 million mi-
grants have crossed our southern bor-
der. That is an astronomical number, 
1.2 million. To provide some context, in 
7 months, Customs and Border Protec-
tion encountered 21⁄2 times as many 
people as they did in all of fiscal year 
2020. 
So it is not getting any better if the 
Secretary of Homeland Security, whose 
responsibility it is to secure the bor-
der, says things are no worse off than 
they used to be. At the same time, he 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
numbers 
are 
unrivalled in the last 20 years. Both 
can’t be true. 
So whatever you want to call this— 
lying, misleading, or gaslighting—we 
have all had to learn a little bit of a 
new vocabulary. ‘‘Gaslighting’’ basi-
cally means creating your own alter-
native reality and trying to sell that as 
true. 
None of this changes the fact that 
the Biden administration has consist-
ently tried to deceive the American 
people about each of these matters. 
And the list actually goes on and on. 
The President and his administration 
won’t even admit there is a humani-
tarian crisis along our southern border, 
let alone take the pretty obvious and 
necessary steps to address it. 
Senator SINEMA
from Arizona, a 
Democrat, and I, a Republican from 
Texas, working with HENRY CUELLAR, a 
Democrat 
from 
Laredo, 
and 
TONY 
GONZALES, a Republican who represents 
the largest border district in the coun-
try, we presented the bipartisan border 
security plan, but the administration 
just looks the other way. 
They won’t acknowledge their mas-
sive failures in Afghanistan either, 
which resulted in the death of 13 serv-
icemembers and left our allies, our 
friends, and their families in a lurch. 
And they refuse to admit that their 
reckless tax-and-spending-spree bill is 
designed to fundamentally transform 
America and will drive up taxes not 
just for the wealthy, but for the middle 
class, and hurt our already wobbly 
postpandemic economy. 
This is not what leadership should 
look like. The American people deserve 
better than getting scammed by their 
own President, no less. 
If the administration put half as 
much energy in trying to solve prob-
lems as it does in trying to disassemble 
them or to cover them up, our Nation 
would be far better off. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, for the past several months, the 
Biden administration and their offi-
cials have devoted their time to one of 
two things: They have blamed Repub-
licans for problems that they, the 
Democrats, created, or denying those 
problems exist at all. 
As my colleague from Texas said: 
Don’t believe what you are seeing. 
That seems to be a common refrain. 
Just last week, White House Chief of 
Staff Ron Klain retweeted the former 
Chairman of President Obama’s Coun-
cil of Economic Advisers when he dis-
missed rising inflation and collapsing 
supply chains as ‘‘high class prob-
lems.’’ 
Apparently, he thinks those sky-high 
prices at the grocery store only affect 
the rich. How wrong they are. 
On this same day Ron was scrolling 
through Twitter, White House Press 
Secretary Jen Psaki insisted that the 
American people just started paying 
attention to their finances this year. 
Never before this year have they 
looked at their finances. She stood in 
front of the entire press pool, dismissed 
serious economic pain as a passing con-
cern, and tried to spin the memory of 
the prepandemic, pre-Biden economy 
out of everyone’s memory. 
Last week, I saw firsthand the con-
sequences of this policy of deflection. 
Let me tell you, if you want to see 
what it looks like when our govern-
ment undermines and abandons entire 
communities, you need look no further 
than our Nation’s southern border. 
What I saw during my recent trip to 
south Texas was a humanitarian crisis, 
a healthcare crisis, and a national se-
curity crisis. And make no mistake, 
nothing that is happening down there 
is the result of some unfortunate acci-
dent. 
This is no everyday failure of leader-
ship. If our so-called border czar cared

October 18, 2021 
at all about doing her job, she would 
know that every single Border Patrol 
agent needs to hear from her. Law en-
forcement officers, they want to hear 
from her. And property owners in the 
area believe with absolute certainty 
that this issue on the southern bor-
der—this is a fixable issue. It is fixable. 
Our Border Patrol agents want to do 
their job, but they are undermined 
every step of the way by the official 
policies of an administration that has 
spent billions of dollars canceling con-
struction of the border wall. 
That is correct. They are spending 
your money—your taxpayer dollars, 
your 
hard-earned 
money—canceling 
contracts, canceling contracts, can-
celing construction of the border wall. 
And they have stripped resources 
that the Border Patrol needs, pulling 
back resources like surveillance tech-
nology, pulling back funding that could 
help pay overtime for Border Patrol of-
ficers. 
They have pulled all of that back 
from the Department of Homeland Se-
curity, doing it even as the number of 
migrants who are surging the border is 
increasing, even as the apprehensions 
at the border are increasing. They are 
reducing the resources that the Border 
Patrol agents have. 
During 
conversations 
with 
these 
agents, we all came to the conclusion 
that most Americans have no idea how 
truly serious this problem is, which is 
the logical conclusion of another Biden 
administration policy of blocking press 
access to key areas of the border. 
They do not want you to see or hear 
about what is going on. They don’t 
want you to see the chaos they have 
created. And they surely don’t want us 
to see the trail of destruction left by 
this flood of illegal immigration. So 
they don’t the press down there. They 
don’t want them to get the message 
out about what is happening, how our 
southern border is being overrun and 
our Border Patrol overworked. 
At this point, not only me, but many 
of my colleagues—and there are some 
on both sides of this aisle—have docu-
mented for the record the horrific jour-
ney migrants undertake from Central 
America to the United States. And, 
yes, migrants are coming from 150 dif-
ferent countries through Central Amer-
ica and Mexico to our southern border. 
We know that the cartels are in com-
plete control of that border on the 
Mexico side. 
And do you know what? The cartels, 
you have to pay them—got to pay 
them—in order for them to get you 
here. You get to the river, you got to 
pay the river tax to a coyote who 
works for the cartel in order to cross 
the river. The cartel controls who gets 
into the United States of America. Yes, 
it is illegal entry, but think about this: 
The cartels are in control. 
In South Texas, there are three car-
tels that are working that border—dif-
ferent parts of that border. It is big 
business for these cartels. And, yes, we 
know about drugs and weapons and sex 
trafficking and gangs and human traf-
ficking. In South Texas, they have 
caught members from 88 different 
gangs—88—who are moving their peo-
ple into this country. They are not 
coming here for a better life and a job. 
They are coming here because, gangs, 
they carry out crimes. 
But what many Americans haven’t 
seen and witnessed is the impact all 
this has on your average border com-
munity. When I was in Texas, I had the 
privilege of speaking to ranchers and 
other property owners dealing with the 
nightmare of regularly discovering the 
remains of dead adult migrants, some-
times discovering children. 
Traffickers abandon these individ-
uals while they are crossing some of 
the ranchers’ and the property owners’ 
property, just abandoned, abandoning 
these people right there on the prop-
erty. 
These 
property 
owners 
are 
also 
forced to spend time and energy repair-
ing damage that is inflicted to their 
property by the trespassers who are 
trying to avoid the checkpoints that 
are north of the border. 
We are talking about an emotional 
and a practical toll that has crept out-
ward from the border, away from those 
remote ranches and outposts, and into 
communities all across this country. 
Administration officials started all 
this with their open border rhetoric, 
but they could also put a stop to it. 
How? By holding themselves account-
able to the people who are stuck trying 
to control this chaos—people like Hec-
tor and Chris and their fellow Border 
Patrol agents, who risk their lives 
every day to keep us safe. 
They said: You know, it is like doing 
your job with one hand tied behind 
your back. 
And then they say: OK. We are going 
to try to strap down the other hand a 
little bit. 
That is right. That is what it means 
when you talk about removing re-
sources, removing surveillance, pulling 
back money so they can’t go do the job 
that they want to do, that they signed 
up to do, to keep this country safe. 
Everybody in this administration 
should spend a few minutes talking 
with property owners like Susan and 
like Richard and think about what it 
must feel like to constantly wonder if 
somebody has died of exposure in your 
backyard. This is what they are deal-
ing with every day. 
The Federal Government is not out 
there repairing fences that have been 
torn down. The Federal Government is 
not out there cleaning up trash. The 
Federal Government is not there re-
planting a sugarcane field. No. Ranch-
ers, property owners, they are paying 
for this out of their pocket because 
this is happening on their property. 
The status quo that this administra-
tion has created on this border can’t 
last much longer because it is running 
people ragged, whether they are work-
ing the river, working the border; 
whether they are trying to work their 
ranch, their cattle, their crops. This is 
out of control. 
The other thing that I have noticed 
as I was on the border and then talking 
to a lot of Tennesseeans, hearing from 
people: 
The 
American 
people 
are 
afraid. The spin doctors in the White 
House and in the mainstream media 
would have us believe that fear is due 
to racism or xenophobia, but those ac-
cusations are misstatements. They are 
inaccurate. 
Americans are not afraid of those 
who seek refuge in our country. Ameri-
cans are afraid of the documented rise 
in drug trafficking and gunrunning and 
sex trafficking. They are infuriated to 
see their own fellow citizens throwing 
in their lot with the drug cartels and 
participating in these trafficking rings. 
People in their communities are choos-
ing blood money over gainful employ-
ment, and they hold these cartels re-
sponsible. And they fear the hold the 
cartels have over some of their neigh-
bors. It terrifies them. 
But what terrifies them most of all is 
the knowledge that President Biden, 
his Cabinet, and his allies in Congress 
know this, and they refuse to help. We 
know the problem is fixable, as the 
Border Patrol agents told me. This is 
fixable. There are solutions. We know 
the administration has the power to do 
it. It is pretty simple. 
And this is what they have said: En-
force the rule of law. There are laws on 
the books. Enforce them. Illegal entry 
is illegal. They say: Start by building 
the wall. Build it; finish it; get it fin-
ished. They need it. They have been 
saying it for 30 years: We need a wall. 
We need a wall. Border Patrol and 
other law enforcement agencies have 
been asking for this barrier for a long 
time. And if you were to go down 
south, you would see for yourself. Ev-
erything you need to build that border 
is there: the equipment, the panels. It 
is all there. Build the wall. 
Part of it is up, but we need to fill it 
in so that we secure that border—and 
additional funding for security and in-
frastructure and manpower. Build that 
wall. Get back to work on it. 
Next, the administration must stop 
waging war against President Trump’s 
successful ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy. 
The Border Patrol, law enforcement, 
the Texas Department of Public Safe-
ty, the National Guard—they will all 
tell you: Yes, get back to building that 
wall, and while you are at it, go back 
to ‘‘Remain in Mexico.’’ 
You know what? They want this be-
cause it works. It works. Isn’t that 
amazing? It works. So go back to it. 
We 
cannot 
afford 
to 
allow 
the 
operatives at the helm of the Demo-
cratic Party to dictate security policy. 
We know ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ works, 
so embrace it. Say: We are doing this 
because Federal employees, the Border 
Patrol, are asking us to do this. 
We must also eliminate catch-and-re-
lease and embrace the removal author-
ity granted under title 42. Those are 
things that we know work. Those are

the things at the top of the list with 
our local law enforcement, with Texas 
DPS, with our Border Patrol. Those are 
the things that they say: These could 
be done right now. Go back to building 
that wall; go back to ‘‘Remain in Mex-
ico’’; stop this catch-and-release; and 
abide by title 42. 
Today, President Biden, who hasn’t 
been to the border, should go and say: 
You know what? This Nation is a sov-
ereign nation; we are going to protect 
this Nation; we are going to protect 
our citizens; and, therefore, we are 
going to take these measures because 
the Border Patrol says this is what 
works. 
The time for treating these policies 
like political footballs has come to an 
end. The border crisis doesn’t exist in a 
bubble, and it doesn’t just exist at the 
southern border. What we are seeing 
along that border is loss of life and loss 
of livelihoods, and it is happening on a 
daily basis. 
How would you feel? How would you 
feel if they were running across your 
crops? How would you feel if they were 
on your ranch? Think about that one. 
It is clear by now that the White 
House values their ‘‘woke’’ talking 
points, but there is nothing ‘‘woke’’ 
about the death and destruction we are 
seeing tear through this border. There 
is nothing ‘‘woke’’ about allowing the 
cartels to overwhelm law enforcement 
and leave innocent people entrapped by 
those cartels to die in the desert. There 
is nothing ‘‘woke’’ about allowing a 
crisis to fester to make the political 
case for open borders. 
Until President Biden and the Demo-
crats prioritize safety and secure the 
border they abandoned on the day that 
they took power and control, every 
town—every town in this country will 
be a border town, and every State will 
be a border State; every community 
will exist under the threat of cartel vi-
olence, and every person in America 
will bear witness to the desperation 
and loss of life that their President has 
seen fit to ignore. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Montana. 
REMEMBERING EARL OLD PERSON 
Mr. 
TESTER. 
Madam 
President, 
thank you for the recognition. 
I want to share a few words this 
afternoon to honor an incredible lead-
er, somebody who is well known to the 
State of Montana and certainly well 
known to Indian Country, throughout 
this country, a personal friend of mine 
who passed away last week. 
The person’s name is Chief Earl Old 
Person of the Blackfeet Nation. He 
served 56 years as a Tribal councilman. 
He passed away last Wednesday, Octo-
ber 13, at the age of 92. He was the 
longest serving elected Tribal official 
in the United States when he passed. 
He was a keeper of Tribal history, a 
tireless advocate, and, for many, he 
was a national voice for the challenges 
in Indian Country. 
Chief Old Person was born in 1929. He 
grew up on the Blackfeet Reservation, 
where he embraced Tribal culture and, 
at a young age, performed traditional 
Blackfeet song and dance across the 
State and the Nation as an ambassador 
for the Blackfeet. He even traveled to 
Paris to represent Indian Country as 
the only Indian Boy Scout at the World 
Boy Scout Jamboree in 1947. 
It was clear that leadership was in 
his bones, and in 1954 he was elected to 
his first term as a Tribal council mem-
ber, and he became the Tribal council 
chairman only 10 years later. 
Chief Old Person went on to serve as 
President of the National Congress of 
American Indians. He played an inte-
gral part in creating the Nation’s first 
tribally owned bank, helping to earn 
him the honor of being named Out-
standing Indian of the Year by the Chi-
cago Indian Council. 
In 1978, Earl Old Person became Chief 
Earl Old Person, a title that he would 
hold with honor until his passing last 
Wednesday. In his role as chief, he 
would not only represent the Blackfeet 
Tribe but all Tribal nations in Mon-
tana and on the Governor’s task force 
on Indian affairs and as the chairman 
of the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest 
Indians. 
He met with every U.S. President 
from Truman to Obama and had joined 
the British royal family and Canadian 
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau for the 
Commonwealth Games in 1978. Wher-
ever he went, he was pushing for 
progress. 
There are too many honors and 
awards for me to name, but Chief Old 
Person’s impact goes far beyond his ac-
colades. He was a wise leader, a world- 
class orator, and I have heard stories of 
his words that brought folks to tears. 
His shoes will never be filled, but the 
fact that we had the opportunity to see 
his leadership in action gives us the 
roadmap for a brighter future. He will 
sorely be missed by the Blackfeet Na-
tion, by the State of Montana, by In-
dian Country across this country, and 
by my wife Sharla and I as well as 
countless others who knew him. 
This world is a better place because 
of Chief Old Person and the work that 
he did. He will never be replaced. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7027 
October 18, 2021 
the motion to reconsider is considered 
made and laid upon the table, and the 
President will be immediately notified 
of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
VACCINES 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to address a topic this afternoon 
here in the U.S. Senate that I believe 
not enough people are talking about. It 
is something that I certainly heard a 
lot about when I was back home in 
Alaska, and I think it is something 
that millions of Americans are talking 
about. 
But nobody here on the Senate floor 
is talking about, but we should be be-
cause this goes to constitutional au-
thority, and it goes to what I believe 
means to be an American—freedom, 
liberty, and it is this: the Executive 
order that the President—President 
Biden issued mandating vaccinations 
for both Federal contractors and pri-
vate employers. 
In essence, what he has said in this 
Executive order—we are still waiting 
on the rule—is that employers need to 
have people who are vaccinated—all 
their employees by a certain date or 
they are going to be fired. 
That is the President of the United 
States saying he has that power to 
force employers to make their employ-
ees decide between a vaccination or 
putting food on the table for their fam-
ilies. Vaccination or you are fired. 
We are not talking about that, and 
this is unprecedented—unprecedented. 
Never before has a President claimed 
the authority to actually do this. The 
military is a different exception. Pri-
vate employers who have some connec-
tion to the Federal Government or oth-
erwise, tell your employees: Get vac-
cinated or you are fired. 
And the President of the United 
States is claiming the constitutional 
authority to do that. 
I don’t even think it is a close call. I 
don’t even think it is a close call. 
Never been done before, and I don’t 
even think it is a close call whether 
the President has the constitutional 
authority to do this. 
Think about, if he did, what this 
could mean for power in other realms 
that the executive branch or President 
would have. 
Now, I will stipulate right here, I am 
vaccinated. I have encouraged others 
to get a vaccine in consultation with 
their doctors. We all want to put this 
pandemic behind us, no doubt about it. 
The vaccinations help with that. But 
that doesn’t mean there should be an 
excuse to look the other way when the 
President is acting in an unconstitu-
tional manner. 
And there are many reasons, cer-
tainly with regard to my constituents, 
that people might be hesitating with 
regard to a vaccine. Some of them have 
health conditions that preclude them 
from taking a vaccine. Some of them 
may have serious religious objections 
to the vaccine. Some of them have his-
tories of abuse and don’t trust the Fed-
eral Government or the medical estab-
lishment. Some of them have dug in 
their heels and believe the government 
simply doesn’t have the right to tell 
them what substance to put in their 
bodies. 
The President of the United States is 
taking this unprecedented—and it is 
unprecedented—action: Get a vaccine 
or the Federal Government will man-
date you get fired. 
It is not just in my view unconstitu-
tional, but it shows contempt for hard- 
working Americans; contempt that I 
see percolating again and again among 
some in the far left. 
Think about it. You don’t say what 
you think we should say, you are fired. 
You work for an industry that used to 
power America but now is out of favor 
with some on the left—oil, gas, coal, 
especially in Alaska, as the Presiding 
Officer knows—we will shut down your 
business and we will make sure your 
employees are fired. You speak your 
mind about an issue, you are fired. You 
don’t take a vaccine, you are fired. 
Oh, by the way, I think the Federal 
deadline on the vaccination put out by 
the President is December 8. So you 
are going to be fired right before the 
holidays. 
Now, as you know, this is a 180-de-
gree turn—180 about-face—with regard 
to what this body did last year. 
What do I mean? 
So we worked in a bipartisan way 
during 2020, when the pandemic hit, 
particularly the CARES Act. I think 
every U.S. Senator voted for that. But 
the other relief that we worked hard 
on, Democrats and Republicans—when 
the historians look back at 2020, there 
are going to be a lot of things, but I 
think one good thing is they are going 
to say the Congress of the United 
States came together, no playbook—we 
certainly had never seen this before— 
came together to help the American 
people; Democrats, Republicans, the 
President—that was President Trump— 
on relief. 
And here is the thing. This is why I 
mean it is a 180-degree turn. One of the 
core principles of all the relief pack-
ages that we passed last year—the 
aviation relief packages that helped 
our airlines, the PPP—throughout all 
the relief bills that passed this body in 
a bipartisan way, one critical compo-
nent was we need to make sure employ-
ers and employees stay connected. 
Almost all the relief said: All right. 
Airline industry, we can’t let you go 
under. You have got to stay safe in 
terms of the ability to fly for the 
American people. You are going to get 
billions and billions and billions in re-
lief, but you can’t fire your employees. 
You have to keep them connected. 
The PPP, the estimates are tens of 
millions of Americans kept their jobs 
because of that program. You got re-
lief, small business in America, but you 
can’t fire your employees. That was 
the agreement. That is what we worked 
on. That was the core principle that 
helped us get through the pandemic 
economically. 
Joe Biden is taking a sledge hammer 
to that connection. It is actually the 
exact opposite. We are still challenged 
by the pandemic. Our economy is still 
challenged. 
But what is he doing? 
If you don’t listen to Joe Biden, pri-
vate employers in America, you have 
to fire your employees. 
That is exactly the opposite of how 
this body worked across the aisle, 
Democrats and Republicans, and the 
previous President. The approach was 
this: We are going to help you, but you 
have to keep your employees. That is 
the right approach. That is the right 
approach, and yet no one is talking 
about this new approach from the new 
President: Do what I say, even though 
I don’t have the constitutional author-
ity. You have to get a mandate, even 
though I don’t have the constitutional 
authority. And if you don’t, I am going 
to make sure private employers fire 
their 
employees—oh, 
right 
before 
Christmas. 
Doesn’t anyone have a problem with 
this? 
Well, I have a problem with this. 
And, again, I think people should get 
vaccinated. I just don’t think the 
President of the United States has the 
constitutional authority to tell Ameri-
cans: Do it or you are going to get 
fired. 
So here is what I hope. I have been 
reaching out to some of our business 
leaders to make a respectful request, 
and it is this: You don’t want to fire 
your employees. Heck, this country 
doesn’t have enough people who are 
working right now. 
You have the Biden economy, which 
is long lines, superhigh energy prices, 
people who aren’t working, and empty 
shelves. We need more workers. We cer-
tainly don’t need the President of the 
United States telling employers: Fire 
your people prior to Christmas, but 
that is what he is doing. 
So here is what I think, respectfully, 
our business leaders should be doing. 
They should be looking and remem-
bering what we did last year. For ex-
ample, if you are an airline executive, 
we all worked really hard to make sure 
we continued to have air service for 
America and it was safe and that you 
kept your employees. 
So what our business leaders should 
be doing is saying respectfully: Mr. 
President, it is highly unlikely you 
have this authority, and I don’t want 
to fire my employees. 
The best business leaders I know are 
very loyal to their employees. 
So hold off. Don’t fire them because 
Joe Biden says you have to. In the liti-
gation that is going to play out in this 
country, he almost certainly is going 
to lose—almost certainly. I don’t think 
there is a court in America that says 
that the President of the United 
States, without Congress’s permission 
or passing a law—that the President of 
the United States on his own—has the

power to go to private sector employ-
ees and say: Your employees have to 
get vaccinated or you, Mr. Employer, 
have to fire them. 
I think the President is going to lose 
that case in every court in America. So 
if you are a business leader, here is my 
respectful request: Hold off. Wait for 
the litigation to play out, and don’t 
fire your employees because the Presi-
dent has told you to because they 
haven’t 
gotten 
vaccinated 
before 
Christmas. 
You know, we are already starting to 
see this. Some business leaders are tak-
ing a different approach, not this ‘‘Do 
what I said or you are fired.’’ They are 
offering financial incentives, hiring 
medical advisers to talk to their em-
ployees. They are allowing medical and 
religious exemptions. They are offering 
testing as an alternative to forcing the 
vaccine on their workers. And I read 
about one today. I have had discussions 
with others who are saying: Look, it is 
not our intention to fire employees 
right before Christmas. 
These are the leaders who are saying 
they value and trust their employees, 
like what we did last year. Here is sig-
nificant relief, businesses in America, 
but don’t fire your employees. As a 
matter of fact, you can’t if you accept 
this aid—which they didn’t. 
So these are the leaders who value 
their employees. And, at the end of the 
day, this is the approach that is going 
to work. It is going to work better for 
all of us—for these businesses, their 
workers, their communities, and our 
country. 
I wish the President would take note 
of this, but right now he seems hell- 
bent on doing a 180 from what we did 
last year, and that was encouraging 
businesses to work through the pan-
demic while keeping their employees, 
not ordering in an unconstitutional 
manner the firing of employees because 
Joe Biden said so.

MORNING BUSINESS 
125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
CHICAGO FEDERATION OF LABOR 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, growing 
up in East St. Louis, both my mom and 
dad worked for the railroads. We 
weren’t wealthy, but we had a com-
fortable life. I have come to learn how 
connected that was to our being a 
union family. I believe that more than 
any other force in American history, 
the American labor movement has cre-
ated middle-class opportunity in Amer-
ica. Unions have won victories that 
have allowed American workers to buy 
homes, send their kids to college, and 
save for retirement. I know firsthand 
that none of this would be possible if 
workers did not have the freedom to 
advocate for fair working conditions 
for themselves and their families. 
That is why I am proud to say that 
Chicago is the hometown of the Amer-
ican Labor Movement, the site of the 
Haymarket Affair, the Pullman rail-
road strike, and the Republic Steel 
Strike. Today, Chicago’s union mem-
bers continue to be students of history 
and recognize the struggles of those 
who fought for fairness, justice, and 
equality at work. Throughout its 125– 
year history, the Chicago Federation of 
Labor—CFL—has consistently fought 
for fair treatment of workers in Chi-
cago, 
Cook 
County, 
and 
beyond. 
Though the people, challenges, and 
times may have changed, the CFL’s 
mission has remained firm. Through-
out its history, the CFL has organized 
workers across industries regardless of 
race, ethnicity, or nationality. Today, 
we celebrate the great work of the Chi-
cago Federation of Labor and con-
gratulate its staff and supporters on its 
125th anniversary. 
The Chicago Federation of Labor was 
chartered in 1896 by the American Fed-
eration of Labor. Formed, in part, as 
an attempt to end corruption in Chi-
cago’s labor unions, the CFL focused 
its early efforts on strengthening a 
unified voice for the city’s labor move-
ments, upholding the labor rights of its 
union members, and mediating con-
tract disputes on behalf of local unions. 
In 
1906, 
Irish 
immigrant 
John 
Fitzpatrick was elected president of 
the CFL. An organizer and committed 
unionist, his innovation ushered in an 
era of stability and reform to the union 
community. During his 40-year tenure 
as president, Fitzpatrick created acces-
sible news publications and established 
the labor party. 
Upon Fitzpatrick’s death, William 
Lee, president of Bakery Drivers Union 
Local 734 and vice president of the 
CFL, was elected president and would 
go on to serve for nearly 40 years. Lee 
continued Fitzpatrick’s commitment 
to racial and social justice, as the CFL 
and other labor organizations sup-
ported Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 
organizing his visits to and rallies in 
Chicago. In 1964, then-CFL President 
Lee celebrated the signing of the 1964 
Civil Rights Act on the front page of 
the Federation News, writing, ‘‘[W]e 
have come closer to the ideal of the 
Declaration of independence with the 
Civil Rights Law.’’ 
In its fight for justice for all workers, 
the CFL has welcomed freedom fight-
ers and labor leaders from around the 
world to Chicago, including Cesar Cha-
vez, Lech Walesa, and Nelson Mandela. 
In 1994, under the leadership of Presi-
dent Don Turner, the CFL launched its 
Workers’ Assistance Committee, now 
the CFL Workforce and Community 
Initiative, which provides job seekers, 
including 
veterans 
and 
low-income 
workers, with training and job search 
resources. In recent years, the CFL has 
worked to pass increases to the min-
imum wage, paid sick leave, protec-
tions to retirement security, and a 
host of other policies to protect work-
ers. 
While in Congress, I have had the 
pleasure of working with the CFL on a 
variety of issues. Just this year, I was 
honored to work with current CFL 
President Bob Reiter on the inclusion 
of a 100 percent coverage for COBRA 
health insurance premiums as part of 
the American Rescue Plan Act, helping 
millions of struggling workers to re-
main on their employer health plans. 
The blueprint created 125 years ago 
has evolved, but the mission of the 
CFL has remained constant. Today, 
with nearly 300 affiliates and 500,000 
union members in Chicago and Cook 
County, the CFL continues to embody 
the ethos of practical idealism and un-
relenting determination for working 
people. 
Congratulations to the Chicago Fed-
eration of Labor on 125 years of great 
work, giving workers a support net-
work to advocate for their rights. 
(At the request of Mr. THUNE, the fol-
lowing statement was ordered to be

51ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE EMER-
GENCY NURSES ASSOCIATION 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, on be-
half of myself and Mr. WICKER, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the 
51st anniversary of the Emergency 
Nurses Association. Made up of 51,000 
members from all across the globe, the 
Emergency 
Nurses 
Association, 
or 
ENA, is the only professional organiza-
tion dedicated to advancing excellence 
in 
emergency 
nursing 
and 
is 
the 
world’s premier organization for emer-
gency nurses. 
Founded in 1970, ENA has worked 
successfully to raise awareness and im-
prove outcomes for the Nation’s trau-
ma patients. Traumatic injuries, in-
cluding car crashes, falls, head injuries, 
burns, and firearm injuries, are cur-
rently the leading cause of death for 
Americans aged 44 or younger. Working 
to improve outcomes for those who 
have suffered a traumatic injury, ENA 
offers courses for emergency nurses 
that provide them with the knowledge, 
skills, and hands-on training needed to 
deliver high-quality trauma care. Since 
1986, ENA’s trauma nursing core course 
has been taken by more than 2 million 
emergency nurses and is now consid-
ered the gold standard for the edu-
cation of nurses in lifesaving trauma 
care techniques. Alongside their out-
standing educational courses, ENA has 
been a fearless advocate at all levels of 
government for safer work environ-
ments in medical facilities and has 
pushed for stronger criminal laws that 
hold those accountable for violence 
against medical employees. 
Especially in times of crisis, ENA has 
been on the frontlines of our medical 
profession. During the COVID–19 pan-
demic, when emergency rooms have 
been turned into battle zones against 
this virus, ENA has worked time and 
time again to ensure that nurses across 
this 
country 
were 
prepared 
and 
equipped to deal with this unprece-
dented crisis. Their tireless dedication 
to protecting and saving lives, while 
risking their own, should be recognized 
and commended by this body. 
On the occasion of the Emergency 
Nurses Association’s 51st anniversary, 
we ask our colleagues to join us in ex-
tending our deepest gratitude to the 
ENA and all its members for their com-
mitment to improving the quality of 
emergency care that has continued to 
save the lives of millions of Americans 
across our country.

October 18, 2021 
TRIBUTE TO BERNARD A. BARTON, 
JR. 
Mrs. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today to congratulate Bernard A. 
‘‘Bud’’ Barton, Jr. on his retirement 
from the Library of Congress and to 
thank him for nearly three decades of 
dedicated public service. 
Since 2015, Bud has served as chief in-
formation officer for the Library of 
Congress. As the senior information 
technology official for the Library, Bud 
established and enforced standards for 
IT resources and oversaw IT design, de-
velopment, and service operations to 
ensure that the needs of the Library 
and those it serves were met. Bud 
oversaw the development of a Library- 
wide digital strategy, worked to im-
prove IT security at the Library, and 
led efforts to optimize and modernize 
the Library’s IT infrastructure. Under 
his leadership, the Library successfully 
addressed more than 100 technology 
recommendations identified by Con-
gress and the nonpartisan Government 
Accountability Office, GAO. 
Prior to joining the Library, Bud 
served as a U.S. Air Force officer, as 
deputy chief information officer for the 
North Carolina National Guard, and 
then as chief information officer for 
the 
Defense 
Technical 
Information 
Center. In these latter roles, Bud man-
aged the design, planning, implementa-
tion, and testing of disaster recovery 
and continuity of operations capabili-
ties for these agencies. 
Mr. Barton leaves the Library a 
stronger institution that is better pre-
pared than ever to serve the needs of 
Congress, researchers, and all Ameri-
cans. 
Bud, thank you for your public serv-
ice. We owe you a debt of gratitude and 
wish you a well-deserved retirement. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO KOBYE NOEL 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, today 
I have the distinct privilege and honor 
to recognize Kobye Noel for over two 
decades of faithful and unwavering 
service to the U.S. Senate. 
Kobye, a native of the Old Line 
State, has held the line during 23 years 
of service to the Senate, always striv-
ing for equity, transparency, and dili-
gence in all she does. From her time on 
the Democratic Policy Committee sup-
porting the work of Leader Harry Reid 
that would lead to our country’s most 
recent budget surplus, to her work as a 
staffer on the Senate Budget Com-
mittee 
supporting 
the 
committee’s 
work to pass the Affordable Health 
Care Act, ushering in a new era of 
healthcare in our country, Kobye has 
never wavered in her commitment to 
this body or to helping the American 
people. 
When not working on committee, 
Kobye has served a host of Senators in-
cluding Senator Doug Jones of Ala-
bama, 
Senator 
Heidi 
Heitkamp 
of 
North Dakota, and Senator OSSOFF of 
Georgia. 
I 
am 
especially 
grateful 
Kobye and her wealth of experience has 
been able to serve on my staff as mail 
manager for the past 10 months. In her 
time 
overseeing 
our 
office’s 
cor-
respondence, we have sent over 200,000 
correspondence messages to Georgians, 
updating them on the issues and legis-
lation critically important to their 
lives. 
It is written that the harvest is plen-
tiful, but the laborers are few. I con-
gratulate Kobye on retirement with 
such distinguished service and wish her 
a bountiful harvest for all of her labor 
on behalf of the U.S. Senate and the 
people of Georgia.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ALAN KALTER 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to pay 
tribute to Alan Kalter, a warm, gen-
erous man and friend to many. Alan 
passed away on October 4, 2021, at the 
age of 78. 
Alan was born in 1943 in Brooklyn, 
NY. He graduated from what was then 
Hobart College in 1964, after which he 
attended the New York University 
School of Law. His radio work began 
while he was still an undergraduate, 
when he served as an announcer for 
WGVA in Geneva, NY. 
While working as a high school 
English teacher, Alan furthered his 
passion for the radio through weekend 
gigs. Three years later, he was hired at 
WHN Radio in New York, where he was 
a newsman for 4 years. Following this, 
Alan transitioned into commercials 
and then game shows. His work as an 
announcer earned him acclaim, and his 
voice was recognizable to people across 
the country. 
In 1995, Alan joined the Late Show 
with David Letterman, following the 
retirement of Bill Wendell. A dynamic 
addition who was known for his open- 
minded willingness to try any stunt or 
suggestion, Alan quickly became be-
loved by staff and audience members 
alike. He was known for his calming, 
affable presence and the enthusiasm 
with which he approached every task 
before him. 
When not on air, Alan lived quietly 
in Stamford, CT, where he resided for 
over four decades. I had the distinct 
privilege of having Alan as a friend, 
and I can attest firsthand to his caring 
and compassion. 
Alan’s great humor and thoughtful 
spirit 
touched 
countless 
lives. 
He 
brightened the days of both friends and 
strangers without a second thought. 
Alan was also guided by his deeply 
rooted values and dedicated himself to 
giving back to his community. 
My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our 
deepest sympathies to Alan’s family 
during this difficult time, especially 
his wife, Peggy, his two daughters, and 
his five grandchildren. May their many 
wonderful memories of Alan provide 
them solace and comfort in the days 
ahead.∑ 
REMEMBERING MARISSA MCCALL 
∑ Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, Marissa 
McCall’s positive impact on Georgians’ 
lives will be felt for generations. 
Marissa was a tireless and effective 
advocate for those who otherwise had 
none. She poured her heart and her 
work into the defense of those who 
faced brutality at the hands of the jus-
tice system; into advocacy for those 
who lacked the resources and connec-
tions to defend themselves; and into 
urgent reform of a justice system in 
which class and race bias are endemic 
and the rights and dignity of individ-
uals are daily violated. Marissa made a 
huge difference for so many. 
Born in Santa Ana, CA, Marissa 
earned her degree in political science 
from Georgia’s Spelman College and 
her law degree from Louisiana State 
University in 2008. 
Marissa developed a first-of-its-kind 
program at the Georgia Justice Project 
to help address the systemic barriers 
facing formerly incarcerated people. 
She joined the Southern Center for 
Human Rights in 2016, cementing her 
role as one of Georgia’s foremost cham-
pions for civil and human rights. 
Marissa’s keen legal mind and deep 
empathy powered her work for reform. 
She fought persistently and effectively 
to end the broken cash bail system at 
Atlanta’s Municipal Court, to reform 
the criminal record system, and to ban 
the shackling of incarcerated women 
during pregnancy. 
In 2020 and 2021, after the murder of 
Ahmaud Arbery, Marissa was instru-
mental in the repeal of Georgia’s citi-
zen’s arrest law. As a result, Georgia 
the first State in the Nation to pass 
such a reform. 
Marissa is remembered by her family 
as a loving mother, a devoted sister, a 
cherished daughter, and a loyal friend. 
Georgia and the United States are 
fairer and more just for Marissa’s serv-
ice. 
I thank my colleagues in the U.S. 
Senate for joining me in honoring the 
work and life of Marissa McCall.∑

PORTING 
THE 
GOALS 
AND 
IDEALS OF NATIONAL DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. 
MURKOWSKI, Mr. DURBIN, Ms. ERNST, 
Mr. LEAHY, and Mr. GRASSLEY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 421 
Whereas, according to the National Inti-
mate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey— 
(1) up to 12,000,000 individuals in the United 
States report experiencing intimate partner 
violence annually, including physical vio-
lence, rape, or stalking; and 
(2) approximately 1 in 5 women in the 
United States and up to 1 in 7 men in the 
United States have experienced severe phys-
ical violence by an intimate partner at some 
point in their lifetimes; 
Whereas, on average, 3 women in the 
United States are killed each day by a cur-
rent or former intimate partner, according 
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics; 
Whereas domestic violence can affect any-
one, but women who are 18 to 34 years of age 
typically experience the highest rates of do-
mestic violence; 
Whereas survivors of domestic violence are 
strong, courageous, and resilient; 
Whereas most female victims of intimate 
partner violence have been victimized by the 
same offender previously; 
Whereas domestic violence is cited as a 
significant factor in homelessness among 
families; 
Whereas millions of children are exposed 
to domestic violence each year; 
Whereas research shows that boys who are 
exposed to domestic violence in their house-
holds are more likely to become perpetrators 
of intimate partner violence; 
Whereas victims of domestic violence expe-
rience immediate and long-term negative 
outcomes, including detrimental effects on 
mental and physical health; 
Whereas research consistently shows that 
being abused by an intimate partner in-
creases an individual’s likelihood of sub-
stance use as well as associated harmful con-
sequences; 
Whereas victims of domestic violence may 
lose several days of paid work each year and 
may lose their jobs due to reasons stemming 
from domestic violence; 
Whereas crisis hotlines serving domestic 
violence victims operate 24 hours per day, 365 
days per year, and offer important crisis 
intervention services, support services, in-
formation, and referrals for victims; 
Whereas staff and volunteers of domestic 
violence shelters and programs in the United 
States, in cooperation with 56 State and ter-
ritorial coalitions against domestic violence, 
provide essential services to— 
(1) thousands of adults and children each 
day; and 
(2) 1,000,000 adults and children each year; 
Whereas more than 160 States, counties, 
and cities have experienced an increase in re-
ports 
of 
domestic 
violence 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas domestic violence programs and 
hotlines have seen a substantial increase in 
contacts since the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic and continue to experience a surge 
in requests for services; 
Whereas local YWCAs shared that between 
March 31, 2020, and late summer 2020, as a re-
sult of the impact from the COVID–19 pan-
demic— 
(1) 69 percent of respondent YWCAs that 
operate domestic violence hotlines reported 
an increase in demand for services; and 
(2) 64 percent of nearly 100 local YWCAs 
who provide domestic violence services (ei-
ther emergency shelter or transitional hous-
ing) reported an increase in demand for do-
mestic violence shelter; 
Whereas while violence as a lived experi-
ence of American Indian and Alaska Native 
women exists in less pressing times, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has increased the chal-
lenges and barriers to accessing safety by ex-
acerbating already existing issues includ-
ing— 
(1) lack of safe housing for victims; 
(2) lack of space in shelters for victims to 
maintain safe social distancing; 
(3) lack of personal protective equipment 
for staff of tribal shelters and victim serv-
ices programs; 
(4) limited transportation for victims; and 
(5) lack of access to adequate health care; 
Whereas respondents to a survey of domes-
tic violence programs reported that sur-
vivors of domestic violence are facing finan-
cial challenges related to COVID–19 and 3⁄4 of 
those respondents reported that survivors 
are having trouble accessing food, and more 
than half of those respondents have reported 
that survivors cannot pay their bills; 
Whereas medical professionals have re-
ported that survivors of domestic violence 
are presenting with more severe injuries dur-
ing the pandemic; 
Whereas domestic violence programs are 
having to change the way they provide serv-
ices in response to the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas advocates for survivors of domes-
tic violence and survivors face the same 
challenges with child care and facilitating 
online learning that others do; 
Whereas, according to a 2020 survey con-
ducted by the National Network to End Do-
mestic Violence, 76,525 domestic violence 
victims were served by domestic violence 
shelters and programs around the United 
States in a single day; 
Whereas some victims of domestic violence 
face additional challenges in accessing law 
enforcement and services due to conditions 
specific to the communities in which they 
live; 
Whereas law enforcement officers in the 
United States put their lives at risk each 
day by responding to incidents of domestic 
violence, which can be among the most vola-
tile and deadly calls; 
Whereas Congress first demonstrated a sig-
nificant commitment to supporting victims 
of domestic violence with the enactment of 
the landmark Family Violence Prevention 
and Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.); 
Whereas Congress has remained committed 
to protecting survivors of all forms of domes-
tic violence and sexual abuse by making 
Federal funding available to support the ac-
tivities that are authorized under— 
(1) the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.); 
(2) the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 
(34 U.S.C. 12291 et seq.); and 
(3) the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Vic-
tims Fund Act of 2021 (Public Law 117–27; 135 
Stat. 301); 
Whereas there is a need to continue to sup-
port programs and activities aimed at do-
mestic violence intervention and domestic 
violence prevention in the United States; 
Whereas domestic violence programs pro-
vide trauma-informed services to protect the 
safety, privacy, and confidentiality of sur-
vivors of domestic violence; and 
Whereas individuals and organizations that 
are dedicated to preventing and ending do-
mestic violence should be recognized: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) the Senate— 
(A) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘Na-
tional 
Domestic 
Violence 
Awareness 
Month’’; 
(B) commends domestic violence victim ad-
vocates, domestic violence victim service 
providers, crisis hotline staff, and first re-
sponders serving victims of domestic vio-
lence, for their compassionate support of 
survivors of domestic violence; and 
(C) recognizes the strength and courage of 
survivors of domestic violence; and 
(2) it is the sense of the Senate that Con-
gress should— 
(A) continue to raise awareness of— 
(i) domestic violence in the United States; 
and 
(ii) the corresponding devastating effects 
of domestic violence on survivors, families, 
and communities; and 
(B) pledge continued support for programs 
designed to— 
(i) assist survivors of domestic violence; 
(ii) hold perpetrators of domestic violence 
accountable; and 
(iii) bring an end to domestic violence.
