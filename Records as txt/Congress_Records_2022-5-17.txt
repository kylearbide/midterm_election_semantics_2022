fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Lord, we lift up our hearts to You— 
even now when the business of the day 
is soon at hand; when there are count-
less other things that vie for our atten-
tion. May just this brief acknowledg-
ment of our devotion to You be found 
acceptable. 
We pause for a moment to seek Your 
presence among us—even if all the 
space we leave for You is just enough 
for a glimpse. May the light You allow 
to shine into our tight schedules serve 
to illuminate our deliberations and 
clarify our thoughts this day. 
Tender and merciful God, hear us 
even when we speak softly to You. May 
we be comforted by Your abiding pres-
ence with us and find assurance that 
You are nearer to us than we are 
aware. 
For You, O God, made us and gave us 
life and breath and everything else. 
And all You have asked of us is to 
reach out for You, in our busyness, in 
our preoccupation, or in our reticence, 
that we may find You. 
We do so now. Hear the prayers we 
offer You as we pray in the name by 
which You have revealed Yourself. 
Amen.

(Applause, the Members rising.) 
Prime 
Minister 
MITSOTAKIS. 
Madam Speaker, Madam Vice Presi-
dent, honorable Members of the United 
States Congress, ladies and gentlemen, 
there is no greater honor for the elect-
ed leader of the people who created de-
mocracy than to address the elected 
Representatives of the people who 
founded their country on the Greek 
model and have promoted and defended 
democratic values ever since. 
I am conscious as I stand before you 
today of the deep ties that bind our 
two Nations together. 
They are a reason for celebration and 
thanks, but they are also a reminder of 
our shared values and beliefs at a time 
when these, again, are being tested. 
Our shared belief in freedom over tyr-
anny, 
in 
democracy 
over 
authoritarianism, in the fundamental 
importance of respect for the rule of 
law over war and anarchy. 
It is an added honor and a great 
pleasure for me to address a joint ses-
sion of the United States Congress 
under 
female 
leadership, 
Speaker 
NANCY
PELOSI
and, of course, Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS. 
For it was a Greek, and a Greek man 
at that, who first advocated equal 
rights for women. In ‘‘The Republic,’’ 
Plato proposed that women should 
share all levels of power and take on 
all challenges, including military serv-
ice. 
Any state that does not employ the 
talents of its women, Plato made clear, 
is wasting half of its resources. And as 
the son, husband, sibling, and father of 
strong, creative women, I couldn’t per-
sonally agree more. 
Like all Greeks, every time I come to 
Washington, I feel as if I am coming 
home, because everything I see around 
me, the architecture, the art, the ideas 
carved into marble throughout the 
city, everything is so familiar. 
Walking into the Lincoln Memorial 
is like walking into the Parthenon 
when it was still intact, before Lord El-
gin’s art collecting hobby defaced it, 
because it was based on the earlier 
monument. Driving by the Supreme 
Court and seeing above the entrance its 
motto and mission, ‘‘Equal Justice 
Under Law,’’ we remember that this is 
a concept that the Greek ancestors 
first conceived and articulated in a sin-
gle word, ‘‘insonomia.’’ 
Of course, it was not only Washing-
ton’s buildings and culture that were 
immeasurably influenced by Greece 
but also the city’s main business, 
democratic politics, were founded in 
Athens as well. In fact, to be brutally 
frank, we all owe our jobs to our noble 
ancestors. 
But I come here, Madam Speaker, 
Madam Vice President, not to seek ap-
preciation from you or praise for them. 
I come before you to celebrate a mir-
acle that all free peoples cherish but 
that binds Greeks and Americans in a 
unique way. That miracle, the Greek 
idea that would forever change the 
world, is that society functions best if 
all of its citizens are equal and have 
the right to share in running their 
state. 
In 
a 
word, 
‘‘democracy,’’ 
‘‘dimokratia.’’ 
It is very, very hard for us to realize 
how radical this idea of individual free-
dom of self-governance was 25 centuries 
ago when a small community of Greeks 
dared to entrust equal political and 
legal rights to all its citizens. Women 
and slaves were excluded, but it was 
still such an extraordinary departure 
from what had gone before it that I be-
lieve it remains the most profound leap 
of faith in human history. 
No society before the Greeks dared to 
believe that order and freedom were 
compatible. All societies before them 
were a succession of tyrannies that re-
lied on a strong leader, a king, a phar-
aoh, an emperor, to keep them func-
tioning. 
This lesson was not lost on the 
Founders of the United States who 
shaped their Constitution, the Amer-
ican Constitution, on the Athenian 
model but were wise enough to insert 
checks and balances to avoid the ex-
cesses 
that 
eventually 
undermined 
Athenian democracy. 
The birth of democracy in ancient 
Athens brought about an explosion of 
the creative spirit in Greece that pro-
duced the architecture, the art, the 
drama, and the philosophy that have 
shaped Western civilization ever since. 
The establishment of democracy in 
the United States has brought about 
the greatest expansion of human free-
dom and human progress the world has 
ever known. 
Ladies and gentlemen, last year, 
Greece celebrated 200 years since the 
beginning of our war of independence. 
And in a very strange but interesting 
twist of historical fate, it was the 
Greek people who were inspired by the 
foundation of American democracy 
when they rose against their oppressor 
to fight for their own freedom. 
What Americans like you had shown 
us by example is that liberty can actu-
ally be fought for and, even against the 
odds, won. We understood the founding 
of your Republic to be a watershed in 
the history of the world, a model for 
the oppressed nations of Europe, a hope 
for our own future. 
Right from the start, therefore, our 
forefathers looked across the Atlantic 
for 
support. 
From 
the 
distant 
Peloponnese, the leaders of the Greek 
revolution sent an appeal in the spring 
of 1821 to the American people, their 
‘‘friends, fellow citizens, and breth-
ren.’’ 
They spoke of the ‘‘natural sym-
pathy’’ the Greeks felt for Americans, 
the thirst for freedom that they had 
both derived from the ancients. They 
wrote at the time: ‘‘In imitating you, 
we imitate our own ancestors. We shall 
show ourselves worthy of them in pro-
portion as we resemble you.’’ 
The Founding Fathers of your Repub-
lic were moved and impressed. ‘‘Light 
and liberty are in steady advance,’’ 
wrote Thomas Jefferson, on learning of 
the news from Greece. ‘‘The flames 
kindled on July 4, 1776, have spread 
over too much of the globe to be extin-
guished by the feeble engines of des-
potism.’’ 
Exactly 200 years ago, in 1822, revolu-
tionary 
Greeks 
assembled 
at 
Epidavros, debated, and we drew up our 
first Constitution. And with this docu-
ment, we introduced into the newly lib-
erated Greek lands a new language of 
rights. Above all, the right of a nation 
to throw off the shackles of tyranny in 
order to live under the rule of law. 
In the words of our Declaration of 
Independence: 
‘‘Have we something lesser than 
other nations, that we remain deprived 
of these rights, or are we of a nature 
lower or less civilized, that we should

view ourselves as unworthy to enjoy 
them and instead be condemned to an 
eternal 
slavery, 
subjected, 
like 
automata or beasts of burden, to the 
absurd caprices of a cruel tyrant. . . . 
These are rights which within Greece 
we have never ceased to defend by arms 
when times and circumstances have 
permitted.’’ 
A shocking reality: Replace the word 
‘‘Greece’’ with ‘‘Ukraine’’ and the simi-
larities to today’s turbulent world are 
harrowing. 
Two years later, in a little town in 
western 
Greece 
called 
Mesolonghi, 
these 
exact 
words 
were 
published 
alongside a translation of the Amer-
ican Constitution. That book was one 
of the first-ever books printed on 
Greek soil. It stands testimony to the 
immense values we Greeks attached 
from the start of our own future as a 
liberal and constitutional polity. 
That this little book appeared at the 
height of the war was remarkable. 
That it was printed in Mesolonghi was 
simply 
incredible. 
Like 
Mariupol 
today, Mesolonghi’s outnumbered and 
emaciated defenders would repeatedly 
repel wave upon wave of enemy attacks 
before their final desperate sortie, an 
act of extraordinary daring but one 
that would ultimately cost hundreds of 
lives, many of whom were women and 
children. 
When we see the same suffering 
among the outnumbered defenders of 
Mariupol, a city with a Greek name 
and deep Greek roots, we are reminded 
of Mesolonghi and the costs of our own 
struggle. 
Even today, we have not forgotten 
the American volunteers who sailed to 
fight alongside us. Some of them gave 
their lives for our freedom. Their 
names are honored, and their graves 
are still cared for. 
Nor have we forgotten others of your 
countrymen who mounted what must 
have been one of the first humani-
tarian efforts in history by sending 
Greece aid and assistance. Remarkable 
figures like Samuel Gridley Howe 
cared for women and children who had 
been left homeless and destitute, and 
established hospitals, schools, and or-
phanages that supported us in the dif-
ficult years that followed. 
The first school for girls, Madam 
Speaker, Madam Vice President, in 
Greece was founded in Athens in 1831 
by an American pastor, John Hill. The 
Hill Memorial School still continues to 
teach Greek children today in the his-
toric center of Athens. 
This long arc of American philan-
thropy continued throughout the 19th 
century, spreading across the Near and 
Middle East. And in times of dire need 
in the following decades, most notably 
a century ago, when hundreds of thou-
sands of refugees streamed into Greece 
from Asia Minor, following the cata-
strophic aftermath of the First World 
War, American institutions were there 
to bring aid and relief. 
And, of course, we should not forget 
it was the Marshall Plan that helped 
my country rebuild its infrastructure 
after the devastating Second World 
War and the civil war that ensued. 
And in its own way, Greece recip-
rocated. Among the Greek orphans who 
were brought across the Atlantic into 
the United States to escape the fight-
ing after 1821 were a future Congress-
man and a commander in the U.S. 
Navy. 
Young Greeks saved from the war be-
came American educators and writers. 
Many of them were dedicated aboli-
tionists, for the eradication of slavery 
was a cause whose urgent necessity 
spoke directly to men and women who 
had once been enslaved themselves. 
Over the past two centuries, our two 
countries have always been on the 
right side of history. We fought side by 
side in world wars to defend freedom 
and democracy. 
Our democracies have struggled with 
internal demons. Both our countries 
endured the horrific pains of civil wars 
and the desperation of economic crises. 
But we have emerged stronger and 
more committed to defend the values 
that our ancestors gave their lives for. 
Esteemed Members of Congress, I 
began today by saying that this bicen-
tennial is more than a moment of cele-
bration. It is also a reminder of the 
values that bind us together but also 
the tasks that we still face. 
The world has changed a good deal in 
recent months, but the warning signs 
have been with us for decades. Fol-
lowing the end of the Cold War, we na-
ively believed that Europe, which had 
twice driven the world into global con-
flict, had finally found the path to 
peace. 
We believed that international co-
operation and a shared commitment to 
the rule of law now prevailed over guns 
and armies. 
We believed that the deepening of the 
European Union, a unique experiment 
in the history of the world designed to 
further link our countries together, 
would make war on the dark continent 
unthinkable. 
We believed that given the tragic and 
harrowing experiences of the 20th cen-
tury, no one would ever venture to sup-
press another people’s right to exist or 
alter its borders by force. 
We naively ignored the warning signs 
flashing red. And we even ignored Rus-
sia’s actions in Syria and its annex-
ation of Crimea. 
We now know that we were wrong. 
Today, like all of you, we Greeks 
look at what is happening just 500 
miles to our north, and we are horrified 
and appalled. We look to Kyiv, and we 
look to Odessa, the city where our rev-
olution was first conceived. 
We look at the tragedy unfolding in 
eastern Ukraine. Mariupol was a city 
founded by Catherine the Great in 1778 
to resettle Greeks from Crimea who 
were fleeing Ottoman rule. And what 
we see is, once more, a people who are 
faced with the necessity of fighting to 
defend themselves in order to secure 
their future and their freedom. 
Let me be very clear: We have no ani-
mus toward the Russian people, with 
whom we have been bound so closely by 
faith and history. But we cannot—we 
simply cannot—be indifferent to a 
struggle that reminds us so much of 
our own. 
We, too, know what it is to be forced 
to reckon with invasion, to stand up 
for one’s beliefs, and to have to resort 
to arms to protect our liberty. We 
know something about the heroism of 
the underdog, for whom the first vic-
tory comes from not capitulating in 
the face of overwhelming odds, from 
simply hanging on and praying that 
others will come to our aid. 
And we, too, understand the impor-
tance of friends. We understand the 
power of allies in the defense of the 
values that we share. Without allies, 
the Greeks would not, for all their her-
oism, have been able to win their inde-
pendence. 
And that is why we recognize the im-
portance of taking sides now. And we 
took sides. Unequivocally, we stand by 
Ukraine against Putin’s aggression. 
We delivered humanitarian aid. We 
supplied the Ukrainians with weapons 
to help them defend their homeland. 
And we have welcomed—we have wel-
comed with open arms, the refugees 
who have fled Ukraine in search of 
safety for themselves and their fami-
lies. 
Mr. Putin is striving to create a 
world in which power is for the strong 
state but not the small. A world where 
territorial claims are made on the 
basis of historical fantasies and en-
forced by aggression, rather than de-
cided by peace treaties. A world in 
which armies rather than diplomats 
settle disputes. 
He will not succeed. He must not suc-
ceed. He must not succeed, not only for 
the sake of Ukraine, but also in order 
to send a message to all, in order to 
send a message to all you other author-
itarian leaders that historical revi-
sionism and open acts of aggression 
that violate international law will not 
be tolerated by the global community 
of democratic states. This language of 
resentment, of revisionism, and impe-
rial nostalgia, this language cannot 
prevail. 
And speaking of open acts of aggres-
sion, I ask you, esteemed Members of 
Congress, not to forget an open wound 
that has caused Hellenism unending 
pain over the past 48 years. I am refer-
ring to the invasion and subsequent di-
vision of Cyprus. This issue has to be 
resolved in accordance with inter-
national law and in line with the rel-
evant decisions of the United Nations 
Security Council. As I told President 
Biden yesterday, nobody can, nobody 
ever will accept a two-state solution in 
Cyprus. 
And the same is true, Madam Speak-
er, of all other regional disputes. 
Greece is a peace-seeking democracy 
that always extends a hand of friend-
ship to our neighbors. We are always 
open to dialogue. But there is only one

framework we can use to resolve our 
differences: international law and the 
unwritten principle of good neighborly 
relations. 
And I want to be absolutely clear. We 
will not accept open acts of aggression 
that violate our sovereignty and our 
territorial rights. These include over-
flights over Greek islands, which must 
stop immediately. 
Please also note: The last thing, the 
last thing that NATO needs at a time 
when our focus is on helping Ukraine 
defeat Russia’s aggression is another 
source of instability on NATO’s south-
eastern flank. And I ask you to take 
this into account when you make de-
fense 
procurement 
decisions 
con-
cerning the eastern Mediterranean. 
The United States has, I believe, 
vital interests in this part of the world. 
It is very important that you remain 
engaged and work with partners with 
whom you share not only common 
strategic priorities, but also shared 
values and a shared history. 
Ladies and gentlemen, last Thursday, 
the Hellenic Parliament ratified the 
new Mutual Defense and Cooperation 
Agreement between our two countries. 
Whereas previously it was renewed an-
nually by an act of Parliament, now it 
has a 5-year duration, after which it is 
automatically renewed, unless one of 
the parties chooses not to do so. 
This agreement is a powerful testa-
ment of our enduring strategic partner-
ship and our commitment to maintain 
peace and prosperity in the eastern 
Mediterranean. 
And nowhere is that more obvious 
than in Souda Bay, which I know many 
of you have visited. It is the largest 
naval base in the eastern Mediterra-
nean, the only port that can accommo-
date aircraft carriers. 
But it is also obvious in the port city 
of Alexandroupolis, in northeastern 
Greece, which is rapidly becoming an 
energy hub for the entire region. This 
is important. It is important as we 
seek to rapidly diversify away from 
Russian gas, investing in the necessary 
infrastructure that will make it pos-
sible to import large quantities of liq-
uefied natural gas. This becomes crit-
ical, not just for Greece, but also for 
our Balkan neighbors. 
I should tell my colleagues; I don’t 
get this much applause in the Greek 
Parliament. 
We plan to interconnect the Greek 
electricity grids with Cyprus, with 
Israel, but also with Egypt. The pur-
pose is to be able to import cheap, re-
newable energy from the Middle East 
and Africa into the European elec-
tricity system. 
But this thriving partnership be-
tween our two countries is not just 
limited to security and energy. Pfizer 
has set up a big data analytics center 
in Thessaloniki. Microsoft is building 
state-of-the-art data centers outside 
Athens. JP Morgan has invested in one 
of the leading Greek fintec companies. 
I believe that what American compa-
nies see today in Greece is not just a 
country endowed with an advantageous 
geographical position and blessed with 
a natural beauty that makes it a mag-
net for visitors from all over the world. 
What they also see is a dynamic econ-
omy that has overcome the difficulties 
of the pathogenies of the past and is 
supporting entrepreneurship and pri-
vate investment. 
And what they see, which is probably 
the most important aspect of all, is a 
young, talented, well-educated work-
force. These young, talented, well-edu-
cated Greeks who, after a decade of cri-
sis, choose to remain in their homeland 
rather than emigrating; or for those 
who had actually left the country, 
choose to return to Greece now. And I 
am convinced they will be the protago-
nists of Greece’s bright future. 
Esteemed Members of Congress, I 
have spoken about the joint paths that 
our two great democracies have char-
tered over the past two centuries. We 
have every reason today to celebrate 
our achievements. But it would be fool-
ish to remain complacent. 
The United States has a crucial role 
to play today in an even more com-
plicated world. From addressing cli-
mate change to standing up against au-
thoritarian regimes, from countering 
fake news and disinformation to pre-
paring for the next pandemic, the 
world looks to the strongest and most 
prosperous democracy for leadership. 
You simply cannot afford to sit on the 
sidelines. 
Multilateralism, in my mind, is not 
an option; it is a necessity not only for 
a more stable world order but also for 
your own self-interest. 
But we also need to put our own 
house in order. Personally, I am more 
worried about the internal fragmenta-
tions of our democracies than I fear the 
threat of arrogant despots. 
We frequently remember the words of 
President Ronald Reagan: ‘‘Freedom is 
never more than a generation away 
from extinction.’’ But let us not forget 
that Abraham Lincoln referred to the 
‘‘unfinished’’ business of democracy. 
And unfinished it is, indeed. 
Our democracies are threatened by 
the sirens of populists who offer easy 
solutions 
to 
complicated 
problems. 
Their voices are being heard, primarily 
because income inequality has in-
creased in our societies, and many jus-
tifiably feel that they are left behind. 
In Greece, we speak from experience. 
We paid a heavy price for listening to 
them. 
Everywhere in the world—in the 
United States, in Greece, in Europe— 
social media is polarizing public de-
bate. It is transforming the public 
sphere into a modern-day version of 
the Tower of Babel, where we speak dif-
ferent languages and we only listen to 
those who share the same views with 
us. 
There are three major forces that 
collectively bind together successful 
democracies: social capital, and by 
that I mean the extensive social net-
works, with high levels of trust, so ad-
mired by Alexis de Tocqueville when he 
visited the United States in the 1830s; 
strong institutions; and common sto-
ries that forge a unified national iden-
tity. All three are being threatened 
today. 
At the same time, authoritarian re-
gimes are questioning our ability to de-
liver prosperity for all our citizens. 
They are offering their people a Faust-
ian deal: You trade political freedom 
and individual rights for high levels of 
growth and individual economic well- 
being. Many, unfortunately, are willing 
to accept it. 
These are some of the challenges we 
face today. That is why making our de-
mocracies more resilient is such an im-
portant priority for our generation. 
I wish I had the answers to all these 
complicated questions. But I think I 
know where to start. 
We need to strengthen our demo-
cratic institutions to address the root 
causes of the anger and distrust of our 
citizens. 
We need to tackle income inequal-
ities without losing the dynamism of 
our open economies. 
We need to reform social media so 
that it becomes less socially corrosive. 
And we need to train our young people 
to seize the opportunities of demo-
cratic citizenship in this new age. 
And maybe a dive into our shared 
historical past would be of particular 
use. James Madison knew that democ-
racies can be threatened by the ‘‘turbu-
lency and weakness of unruly pas-
sions.’’ That is why insulating deci-
sionmaking from the emotions of the 
moment, while still holding democratic 
leaders accountable on election day, 
was one of his major preoccupations. 
Madison was clearly inspired by Peri-
cles, who knew that democracy had a 
dark side that, if left unrestrained, 
could lead to its downfall. Thucydides 
had Pericles say of ancient Athens: 
We are a free democracy, but we obey our 
laws, more especially those who protect the 
weak, and the unwritten laws whose trans-
gression brings shame. 
Every time we gaze in wonder at the 
Parthenon frieze—half of which, unfor-
tunately, still sits in the British Mu-
seum rather than the Acropolis Mu-
seum where it belongs—we are re-
minded of the glory of a thriving de-
mocracy. Thirty years after the Par-
thenon was constructed, democracy in 
Athens was no more. 
Reinventing democracy to fit the 
challenges of the 21st century may 
sound like a tall order, but this is the 
mission of our generation. And I am 
certain we will accomplish it. 
Esteemed Members of Congress, let 
me conclude by making a special ref-
erence to the one unshakeable bond 
that will always bind our two countries 
together: the Greek-American commu-
nity. 
It is a special moment to see so many 
of you here with us today. Over the 
past 120 years, your country has warm-
ly welcomed, encouraged, and sup-
ported the waves of immigrants who

came to the United States in search of 
a better life, not to mention the stu-
dents like me who spent 7 years study-
ing in American universities. 
Those who sailed to this country 
were not philosophers and poets like 
their noble ancestors. For the most 
part, they were simple laborers, and 
they eagerly took any work that they 
could. 
But no matter how uneducated the 
Greeks, or how menial their work, they 
would typically apply themselves with 
great determination and embrace any 
chance to prosper in life and educate 
their children. They offered them a 
brighter future, fulfilling the solemn 
duty that every generation should be 
able to live a better life than the pre-
vious one. They experienced the Amer-
ican Dream but never forgot where 
they came from. 
Today, the Greeks who live in the 
United States and the 3 million Ameri-
cans who identify themselves as Greeks 
include some of the most respected 
leaders in the arts, science, education, 
medicine, the judiciary, and, of course, 
politics. 
Modern 
visionaries 
like 
Nicholas 
Negroponte and Albert Bourla, John 
Cassavetes and Elia Kazan, Jeffrey 
Evgenidis and George Pelekanos, Alex-
ander Payne and Tom Hanks, and, of 
course, Giannis Antetokounmpo. 
Six of them are in this Congress. One 
of them, my friend Mike Dukakis, ran 
for President of the United States. 
I think one of the reasons Greeks 
were accepted in America so readily 
lies in the fact that the values of 
America and Greek values have so 
much in common. One of the qualities 
that 
Greeks 
value 
the 
most 
is 
‘‘sophrosyne,’’ a word best translated 
as ‘‘self-control, temperance, and har-
mony.’’ 
The ancient Greeks thought arro-
gance, extremism, and excess the worst 
threats to democracy. ‘‘For man,’’ Ar-
istotle wrote, ‘‘life according to reason 
is best and most pleasant, since reason 
more than anything else is man.’’ 
That reason tells me that we Greeks 
and Americans have a lot more to con-
tribute as custodians of democracy, 
that government of the people, by the 
people, for the people shall thrive 
again. 
I bring you here today the pledge of 
the Greek people that we stand to-
gether with the people of the United 
States whenever and wherever nec-
essary to ensure that the hopes our an-
cestors bequeathed to the world 25 cen-
turies ago will endure and the dream of 
freedom for every human being on this 
planet will never die. 
Long live the friendship between 
Greece and the United States of Amer-
ica. 
Thank you, ‘‘efcharisto.’’ Thank you 
very much.

Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-

There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules 
Committee met and reported a rule, 
House Resolution 1119, providing for 
consideration of three measures. 
The first is H.R. 6531, the Targeting 
Resources to Communities in Need Act, 
under a closed rule. The rule self-exe-
cutes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairwoman MALONEY and provides 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform, and provides one mo-
tion to recommit. 
The second is H.R. 7309, the Work-
force Innovation and Opportunity Act, 
under a structured rule. The rule self- 
executes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairman SCOTT, provides 1 hour of de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Education and 
Labor, makes in order 39 amendments, 
provides en bloc authority, and pro-
vides one motion to recommit. 
The third is S. 2938, to designate the 
United States Courthouse and Federal 
Building located at 111 North Adams 
Street in Tallahassee, Florida, as the 
‘‘Joseph 
Woodrow 
Hatchett 
United 
States Courthouse and Federal Build-
ing’’ under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided among and controlled 
by the chairs and ranking minority 
members of the Committees on Over-
sight and Reform and Transportation 
and Infrastructure and provides one 
motion to commit. 
Finally, the rule deems passage of H. 
Res. 1118. 
Mr. Speaker, the Workforce Innova-
tion 
and 
Opportunity 
Act, 
known 
around here as WIOA, is our Nation’s 
flagship workforce development law. 
WIOA is the culmination of decades of 
policymaking by Congress to create a 
federally 
supported, 
State-managed 
system of programming for job train-
ing, adult education, and career serv-
ices, as well as programs to connect 
employers with jobseekers, and help 
with placement, recruitment, and re-
tention. 
WIOA helps achieve our country’s 
key goals of reducing poverty and driv-
ing economic growth by helping work-
ing Americans get the skills, knowl-
edge, and experience they need to suc-
cessfully participate in today’s job 
market. With a new skill, certification, 
or degree, workers can apply for better- 
paying jobs, earning more for them-
selves and their families. 
WIOA and its predecessors have been 
a successful formula for workforce de-
velopment for over 60 years, and to-
day’s bill will ensure that WIOA can 
continue serving workers and their 
families in our changing and dynamic 
economy. 
Today’s bill is an overdue reauthor-
ization for WIOA. While the bill makes 
a variety of important technical ad-
justments to keep the law relevant as 
our economy changes and evolves, the 
bill also upholds the core programs and 
services that have a demonstrated 
record of success. 
The bill’s main achievement is rais-
ing WIOA’s funding levels to meet the 
needs of our workforce. Since the 1980s, 
the number of working Americans has 
doubled, but the funding for our work-
force development programs has fallen 
by over 60 percent even as jobs and our 
economy 
have 
been 
invented 
and 
changed at a dizzying pace. Most of the 
drop in funding happened within the 
last 20 years as that pace accelerated. 
The story of WIOA is the same as 
that of many of our Nation’s key pro-
grams to help working families. Twen-
ty years of harmful budget cuts and 
misguided austerity led by Republican 
Presidents and Republican majorities 
in Congress have resulted in WIOA 
lacking the proper funding to meet the 
needs of the American workforce and 
to allow members of that workforce to 
reach their full potential. 
The funding authorized by this bill 
will allow WIOA programs to train over 
1 million workers a year, creating real, 
tangible benefits for workers and em-
ployers. Put simply, with this boosted 
funding, workers will be able to get 
better jobs, and businesses will be able 
to hire better employees. That is a rare 
win-win policy achievement that we 
should all be able to get behind. 
Today’s WIOA reauthorization bill 
also has an added focus on youth em-
ployment 
opportunities, 
adult 
edu-
cation, and support for formerly incar-
cerated individuals. 
The WIOA reauthorization bill will 
reauthorize programs to help disadvan-
taged and disconnected youth and pro-
vide them with summer programming, 
employment and educational opportu-
nities, as well as youth-specific train-
ing programs. 
The bill will provide community col-
leges with funding and technical assist-
ance to offer employment and training 
programs for in-demand industries—a 
successful model that we have seen uti-
lized in my community—and the bill 
will create a Department of Labor pro-
gram to specifically help individuals 
released from prison transition back to 
the workforce. 
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to high-
light three of my amendments to 
WIOA. As chair of the Congressional 
Youth Mentoring Caucus, one of my 
priorities is to make sure that youth 
are able to access job training and 
meaningful employment opportunities. 
We know that mentors can have a posi-
tive impact on youth in their career 
exploration and early employment op-
portunities. 
My amendments will ensure that 
WIOA’s programming better targets 
youth who are most in need of services 
and is specifically geared to ensure 
positive outcomes for young people. 
The amendments will make summer 
and year-round employment opportuni-
ties accessible to more young people. 
Finally, the amendments will make 
sure that employers, programs, and 
staff that mentor youth will have the 
tools required to provide the support 
and skill development needed to help 
young people succeed in their chosen 
careers. 
All in all, the Workforce Innovation 
and Opportunity Act will address both 
recent and long-term challenges in the 
labor market. Right now, our economy 
has a shortage of approximately 4 mil-
lion skilled workers, and that shortage 
is expected to continue to grow. Reau-
thorizing WIOA is a key to this prob-
lem, so I encourage all my colleagues 
to help American workers and pass this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, sadly, this rule also in-
cludes three suspension bills that failed 
on the floor after our Republican col-
leagues obstructed the business of the 
House of Representatives. 
Included in today’s rule is the Tar-
geting Resources to Communities in 
Need Act and two naming bills which 
were all blocked by House Republicans 
with no other purpose than to obstruct 
the work of Congress on behalf of the 
American people. 
Passing bills on suspension is one 
way in which Congress tries to stream-
line its work in order to devote more 
time to the most pressing issues of the 
day. Suspension bills are bipartisan 
bills narrowly tailored to the problems 
they address. To get on the suspension 
calendar and to be considered with an 
expedited process, a bill must have 
demonstrated strong bipartisan sup-
port. 
By the time a suspension bill gets 
called up on the House floor, majorities 
of both Republicans and Democrats

have to be willing to back the bill. 
However, some of our colleagues across 
the aisle have compromised the suspen-
sion system solely to waste the time of 
the American people and for political 
theater. 
One of the bills we must reconsider 
now is the Targeting Resources to 
Communities in Need Act which would 
use proven strategies to improve the 
direction of Federal funds to areas of 
persistent poverty. This bill will great-
ly improve the effectiveness of many of 
our safety net, housing, hunger, and 
job training programs. 
b 1245 
The bill is bipartisan, bicameral, and 
would benefit low-income Americans in 
both rural and urban communities. 
Yet, House Republicans tanked the 
bill. 
The other two bills would rename a 
courthouse 
after 
Judge 
Joseph 
Hatchett and a post office after Rep-
resentative Lynn Woolsey. 
Joseph Hatchett was a pioneering 
Black lawyer and judge from the State 
of Florida. Born into the Jim Crow 
south, Judge Hatchett set many impor-
tant firsts as a Black judge, ultimately 
becoming the first Black man to serve 
on the Florida Supreme Court. 
Judge Hatchett was a committed 
public servant for the State of Florida, 
a fact recognized by both of Florida’s 
Republican Senators and all 27 of the 
State’s Representatives who cospon-
sored the resolution to name a Florida 
courthouse after Judge Hatchett. 
And yet, House Republicans tanked 
this bill, too, including 10 Florida Re-
publicans who had previously sup-
ported the measure. 
What purpose does this stunt serve? 
What constituent base wants you to do 
this? It is nonsense and a waste of ev-
eryone’s time. 
If a Member doesn’t like a bill, that 
is fine. That is how this place works. 
But we need to work together, in good 
faith, for the American people. It is a 
bad-faith move to torpedo bipartisan 
suspension bills at the last minute. It 
is bad for Congress, and it is bad for 
the country. 
This Congress has seen a worrying in-
crease in this kind of parliamentary 
nonsense from a small but vocal sect of 
the Republican Party. And while it is a 
small group of Members who initiate 
this nonsense, the whole party has 
been happy to go along with it. 
With these three suspension bills, the 
minority leader continues his long and 
troubling streak of being unable or un-
willing to control the behavior of the 
members of his party. 
It is not a good path for our country. 
We have been trending down this road 
for a while, and January 6 was the 
painful result of this type of behavior. 
We should not be here to fight each 
other. We should be here to help the 
American people. Some of our col-
leagues seem to have lost sight of that 
mission, and the whole country is pay-
ing the price. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
for yielding the customary 30 minutes, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule provides 
for consideration of three bills: H.R. 
7309, the Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act; H.R. 6531, the Targeting 
Resources to Communities in Need Act; 
and S. 2938, to name a post office after 
Joseph Woodrow Hatchett. The latter 
two bills failed on suspension last week 
and so now must be considered under a 
rule. 
We were also expecting to consider 
H.R. 7688, the Consumer Fuel Price 
Gouging Prevention Act. But after 
hours of debate in the Rules Com-
mittee on this bill, the Democrats had 
to pull it for lack of support within 
their own party. Perhaps they realized 
that, in fact, there is no evidence of 
price gouging. In fact, this point was 
made by the Secretary of Energy, Sec-
retary Granholm, in a recent Energy 
and 
Commerce 
Committee 
hearing 
where she said: ‘‘I’m not sure anyone is 
saying there is wholesale gouging.’’ 
You know what? We could focus in-
stead on increasing domestic produc-
tion rather than blaming an industry, 
an industry that has also been suf-
fering supply and demand difficulties 
that are significantly influenced by 
global factors and government regula-
tion. 
The Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act reauthorizes programs 
from the 2014 bill of the same name but 
makes no needed reforms to workforce 
development programs. Instead, it in-
creases government control, adds oner-
ous requirements to program adminis-
tration, and decreases flexibility and 
the ability to actually achieve results. 
What are the results that we want? 
Pulling people out of poverty and en-
hancing the labor market. 
First, the bill authorizes $78 million 
over 6 years. It does this without mak-
ing workforce development programs 
more efficient, without making them 
tailored to the actual job market, and 
this funding will further exacerbate 
what is now becoming increasingly evi-
dent as an inflationary crisis. 
The bill expands the size of State and 
local workforce boards, making room 
for organized labor. It also introduces 
Federal definitions of job quality, a de-
termination that actually should be 
made by employers. How is a Federal 
agency 
in 
Washington, 
D.C. 
best 
equipped to determine the job quality 
for someone in Krum, Texas, a town of 
around 4,000 people back in my district 
in North Texas? 
This bill also requires burdensome 
equity reports. If our goal is to pull 
people out of poverty and get them 
into the workforce, then every eligible 
person should have the opportunity to 
access these programs, not just a cer-
tain few who meet certain criteria. 
Finally, this bill maintains the cur-
rent Job Corps system without adapt-
ing to the changing needs of eligible 
youth and continues the inflexibility of 
the current apprenticeship system. I 
have long been concerned that many 
young people do not always recognize 
their best path to prosperity. For ex-
ample, many students are conditioned 
to believe that they can only get a 
good job by attending a 4-year univer-
sity. Meanwhile, a licensed plumber or 
an electrician or a welder can often 
make more than someone with a uni-
versity degree. Apprenticeships have 
been a good way for someone to learn 
these special trades. However, the pro-
gram’s structure is left over from the 
time of the Depression in the 1930s and 
needs to be updated to meet today’s 
vastly different work environments. 
Another 
concern 
I 
have 
is 
the 
amount of student loan debt burdening 
our labor force. Flexible training or 
certificate programs could lead to less 
debt by giving jobseekers alternatives 
to the traditional 4-year university 
path. 
Additionally, we should be looking at 
ways to encourage the private sector, 
private employers, to provide student 
loan repayment programs for their em-
ployees, perhaps through a tax credit 
or other incentive. The Federal Gov-
ernment has a student loan repayment 
program, and it is a significant incen-
tive for many young people to join pub-
lic service. 
The Republican substitute amend-
ment would have added flexibility into 
many 
programs 
and 
reformed 
our 
workforce development systems to en-
sure that employee skill development 
is aligned with employer needs. A huge 
factor in successful programming is 
knowing the programs are actually 
meeting the actual needs. 
The Republican substitute amend-
ment would have ensured that States 
and localities could use funding to sur-
vey employers to understand the most 
in-demand skills. 
Mr. Speaker, in the post-COVID 
world, employers and employees have 
adapted to different styles of training 
and workforce environments. The Re-
publican substitute amendment en-
courages workforce boards to provide 
services virtually to meet the changing 
needs of today’s workforce. We should 
be inserting additional flexibility into 
these programs rather than simply 
maintaining the status quo, a status 
quo that was developed many, many 
decades ago. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
Republican 
amendment was defeated during the 
Education and Labor Committee mark-
up and likely will be defeated when it 
is considered on the House floor. 
Continued partisanship is not the 
path forward when it comes to equip-
ping the workforce for the modern 
labor market. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5018 
May 17, 2022 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on 
Rules. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the 
bills included in this rule are beneficial 
measures that will improve the lives of 
many Americans. But I take a moment 
to highlight two provisions that I am 
glad to see here. 
First is a resolution that I intro-
duced with my colleague on the Rules 
Committee, 
Mr. 
BURGESS, 
to 
urge 
schools to improve nutrition training 
for America’s medical professionals. 
For far too long, our country has over-
looked and undervalued the essential 
role diet and nutrition play in our 
health. 
How do we know? Look at the data. 
U.S. medical schools devote an average 
of 19 hours to nutrition education over 
4 years, with little of that related to 
diet and common health conditions. 
You heard that right: 19 hours on nu-
trition over 4 years. 
All the while, more than 40 percent of 
American adults have been obese and 1 
in 10 suffer from diabetes. Both are 
chronic health problems directly re-
lated to nutrition that cost Medicare 
and Medicaid millions and millions of 
dollars to treat. 
We cannot continue to ignore the 
correlation between diet and health. It 
is time to make sure that our medical 
providers are equipped with the best 
knowledge and tools to help their pa-
tients. 
I thank Mr. BURGESS for his partner-
ship on this important bipartisan ef-
fort. 
Nutrition, food access, and health are 
not only directly connected to each 
other; they are directly connected to 
our progress as a Nation. It is time we 
treat them as such. 
Second, I will touch briefly on an 
amendment that I am offering to the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act of 2022. 
Massachusetts 
arts 
and 
cultural 
group MASSCreative first brought the 
idea behind this amendment to my at-
tention. I thank them for all they do in 
support of the creative industry. 
My amendment will help ensure 
workers with creative skill sets are 
better integrated into the workforce. 
We need people with creative skill sets 
to make art and write plays, but we 
also need them on construction sites 
and web design teams. People with cre-
ative skill sets belong everywhere work 
is being done, and that is what my 
amendment is about. 
Creative workers have been some of 
the hardest hit over the course of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and as we con-
tinue to make our way out of the pan-
demic, we have to support them in in-
novative and imaginative ways. 
Yet too often, our narrow vision of 
what creative workers can or should do 
doesn’t fit the needs or demands of to-
day’s workforce. This amendment is 
about supporting them, so they are 
better integrated into the workforce. 
Not only will this study help assess 
how we can continue to help creative 
workers get back on their feet, but it 
will also illuminate how we can con-
tinue to meet the labor needs of the 
most in-demand industries. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will amend 
the rule to consider H.R. 6858, the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act, introduced by Ranking 
Members 
MCMORRIS
RODGERS
and 
WESTERMAN. 
In the past 2 months, Democrats 
have denied consideration of this essen-
tial bill five times, choosing instead to 
continue their assault on domestic en-
ergy production through drilling and 
export restrictions and massive tax in-
creases on producers. 
Republicans remain committed to 
America’s energy independence by ap-
proving the Keystone XL pipeline, by 
removing restrictions on the United 
States liquefied natural gas exports, by 
restarting oil and natural gas leasing, 
and protecting energy and mineral de-
velopment. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, here to 
explain the amendment is one of the 
most lucid speakers that we have on 
this subject. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Louisiana 
(Mr. 
GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas for the recognition and the 
yielding of time today. 
Mr. Speaker, I spent, like you, much 
time in Louisiana visiting small busi-
nesses and visiting with people who are 
just trying to make ends meet. It was 
National Small Business Week a few 
weeks ago. Visiting businesses, I heard 
over and over and over again the perva-
sive impact, the incredible impact, of 
high gasoline and high energy prices. 
Stephanie Towns in Chicago said: I 
have got kids. I have got to get them 
to school every day. The gas prices are 
just so high, I can’t make it. 
Mr. Speaker, we have had people talk 
about the inability to visit and take 
care of grandchildren, the inability to 
fuel their cars to go to work, the in-
ability to even buy groceries because of 
the profound cost that we have seen re-
lated to energy and related to gasoline. 
b 1300 
But this shouldn’t have been a sur-
prise to anybody. During the campaign, 
President Biden said: ‘‘We are going to 
phase out fossil fuels.’’ ‘‘I guarantee 
you we are going to end fossil fuel.’’ 
The Secretary of the Interior, the 
Cabinet official responsible for pro-
ducing American energy, said, ‘‘I am 
wholeheartedly against fracking and 
drilling on public lands.’’ 
Incredible, incredible statements. 
I will say it again. None of this stuff 
should be a surprise to anybody. This is 
a post we put up on January 27 of last 
year, and we said, ‘‘As a result of Presi-
dent Biden’s energy policies, this is ex-
actly what is going to happen.’’ Let me 
say it again, January 27 of last year, 6 
days after some of these policies. We 
are going to have higher electricity 
bills, higher prices at the gas pump, 
lost revenue for hurricane protection 
and flood control and coastal restora-
tion because there is revenue sharing. 
That is where these dollars go—I have 
no idea what the President is going to 
tell these communities whenever we 
end up having another hurricane on the 
Gulf Coast—higher delivery costs that 
would be passed on to consumers; more 
dependence on foreign energy sources 
like Iran, Russia, China, and other 
countries that don’t share American 
values; and a net increase in global 
emissions. 
I remind you, Mr. Speaker, under 
President Trump, we saw emissions go 
down an average of 2.5 percent per 
year. Under President Biden, we have 
seen them go up 6.3 percent. 
Why is this happening? We have seen 
this administration try to blame price 
gouging, try to say that we are going 
to fix it through the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve releases. We have heard 
him even say that we are going to 
come in, and this is a result of what is 
happening with Ukraine and Russia. 
But let me go back to the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. As a result of their 
announcement to release all of this oil, 
guess what has happened? China has 
bought some of it and others. We have 
actually moved it from one storage 
cavern to another, and they are paying 
to store it in the other place. It doesn’t 
make any sense. 
Meanwhile, prices have only gone up. 
I have a feeling Bigfoot and the Loch 
Ness Monster are going to be the next 
responsible entities for higher energy 
prices. 
Don’t take my word for it. Look, the 
Blackstone CEO said we are going to 
end up with a real shortage of energy. 
What happens when you have a short-
age of supply? Prices go up. If we have 
a shortage, it is just going to cost 
more, and it is probably going to cost 
a lot more; exactly what we have seen. 
The Blackstone CEO says if you try to 
raise money to drill holes, it is almost 
impossible to get that money. They 
have prevented access. 
Here are the real reasons this admin-
istration came out and, on the first 
day, issued an executive order saying 
that they were going to ban new oil 
and gas production in the United 
States. 
Under 
this 
administration, 
under the Biden administration, we 
have nearly tripled dependence on Rus-
sian oil. They, through this House of 
Representatives, passed a bill with up 
to a $10,000 a mile a year pipeline fee.

H5019 
May 17, 2022 
They have increased royalty rates 
through this House of Representatives 
by up to 50 percent, and the adminis-
tration 
unilaterally 
announced 
the 
same thing. 
Mr. Speaker, what happens when you 
impose higher costs? Do you think the 
money just invents itself? No. They 
pass it on to consumers, and boy, have 
they nailed it. They have nailed it. 
Let me quote a former Treasury offi-
cial for the Biden administration: 
Lower gasoline prices ‘‘undercuts the 
administration’s 
climate 
change 
goals—where really to care about fos-
sil-fuel consumption, we don’t want 
lower prices for fossil-fuel buyers, we 
prefer higher prices.’’ They nailed it. 
They nailed it. 
The problem is the impact to the av-
erage American. We can’t afford this. 
It is undermining our ability—like I 
said, grandchildren, groceries, energy 
bills, we can’t even afford to live our 
lives. 
Mr. Speaker, as noted by Mr. BUR-
GESS, there is a solution: the American 
Energy Independence from Russia Act. 
If we defeat the previous question, we 
are going to be able to bring up this 
legislation that unlocks American en-
ergy, allows us to produce energy. 
I don’t know what these people have 
against Americans. Why are we car-
rying out policies that benefit Russia, 
Iran, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia? Do you 
know who I care about? I care about 
domestic energy producers. I care 
about American workers. Why can’t we 
meet our own energy demands just as 
this bill does? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Congress-
man WESTERMAN and Congresswoman 
MCMORRIS
RODGERS
have legislation 
that unlocks American energy, allows 
liquefied natural gas terminals to be 
permanent, reduces the regulatory bur-
den. It ensures that the Keystone pipe-
line can be built, not the policies that 
Democrats are advocating for where, in 
the 
United 
States 
Senate, 
Senate 
Democrats said they want to urge 
Saudi Arabia to use their swing capac-
ity to increase world oil supplies or the 
current runup of world oil prices is ef-
fectively a tax on American families’ 
energy discretionary budget, except 
that the money goes to the OPEC car-
tel rather than the U.S. Treasury. 
Actually, on this one, Mr. Speaker, I 
fully agree. I urge that we defeat the 
previous question; we unlock America’s 
energy resources; and we lower energy 
prices for all Americans. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I will redirect the focus to the under-
lying bill that we are considering with 
this rule, and that is the Workforce In-
novation and Opportunity Act. 
The purpose of that bill is to unleash 
the full power of our investments in in-
frastructure, clean energy, and the 
care economy. It is essential that we 
have a skilled workforce to power 
those industries forward. 
Now, we have seen what can happen 
when we make those kinds of invest-
ments. We have seen them in my dis-
trict as we have invested in training 
our young people through our technical 
institutes, through our community col-
leges, with our employers, and with our 
apprenticeship programs. We are seeing 
the fruits of that labor, as it were, as 
we see people prepared to get the good 
jobs that we are bringing to our region. 
The continued investment in the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act is really critical for my part of the 
country and critical for every district 
across this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the Statement of Administration Pol-
icy in which the administration urges 
the House to pass the WIOA Act of 2022. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 7309—WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPOR-
TUNITY ACT OF 2022—REP. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ 
SCOTT, D–VA, AND 55 COSPONSORS 
To unleash the full power of investments 
in infrastructure, clean energy, and the care 
economy, it is essential that we have the 
skilled workforce to power those industries 
forward. It is equally important that the 
benefits of new job creation are shared by all 
Americans, and in particular those who have 
traditionally been left behind in the labor 
market. The Administration strongly sup-
ports House passage of H.R. 7309, the Work-
force Innovation and Opportunity Act of 
2022, and looks forward to working with the 
Senate on this critical bill. 
The public workforce system should adapt 
to dynamic and rising demand for worker 
skills training and related services. The U.S. 
currently invests just one-fifth of the aver-
age amount spent on workforce and labor 
market programs by advanced economies. 
Workforce 
development 
is 
critical 
to 
strengthening our economy and increasing 
our competitiveness. Our investments must 
match employers’ needs and workers’ goals 
of finding and keeping good quality jobs. 
The Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act of 2022 authorizes three critical 
Administration priority programs as new na-
tional programs—the Sectoral Employment 
through Career Training for Occupational 
Readiness, Strengthening Community Col-
leges, and Reentry Employment Opportuni-
ties programs. These programs will ensure 
greater access to quality training opportuni-
ties and supportive services, particularly in 
infrastructure and supply chain sectors that 
will create pathways for people in under-
served communities to middle-class jobs. 
H.R. 7309 also increases employment pro-
gramming for underserved youth, estab-
lishing a new funding stream for summer and 
year-round employment activities to deliver 
young people the work experience they need 
to connect with future employment and edu-
cation pathways. 
The Administration urges the House to 
pass the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act of 2022. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
31⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), one of the 
most thoughtful leaders in the House 
Republican Conference. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
also rise to oppose the previous ques-
tion on the rule so that we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 6858 to reverse 
the Democratic policies that have de-
liberately created the highest gasoline 
prices ever suffered in this country. 
I remember the 1970s, when America 
was dependent on foreign oil. OPEC cut 
back production, and the government 
tried to hide the price hikes by fiat, 
just as the Democrats now propose. 
The result was mile-long lines at gas 
stations, odd and even rationing days, 
and an economic recession. 
Under the Republican policies of 
Donald 
Trump, 
America 
achieved 
something that seemed impossible in 
those days: American energy independ-
ence. Under Republican policies, we 
were producing more oil than Saudi 
Arabia. We were producing more oil 
than Russia. The average price of gas 
was a little over $2 a gallon. 
Now this time, OPEC didn’t cut back 
on foreign production; the Democrats 
cut back on American production. 
They canceled the Keystone pipeline 
that today should have been pumping 
830,000 barrels of oil every day into the 
American economy. They suspended oil 
and gas leasing on Federal lands. Just 
last 
week, 
they 
withdrew 
drilling 
leases covering a million acres in oil- 
rich Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. 
Now, the left has said for years they 
wanted to raise gas prices to get people 
out of their cars and to end American 
fossil-fuel production. Well, good job, 
Democrats. Mission accomplished. The 
price of a gallon of gas hit an all-time 
record this morning of $4.52 a gallon. In 
the people’s republic of California, it is 
now $6.02 a gallon, something to look 
forward to. Welcome to the world of 
scarcity, the world of Democratic so-
cialism. 
The fact is, our energy crisis is self- 
induced, and it won’t change until the 
zealots directly responsible for it are 
turned out of office. For example, 
watch the vote on the previous ques-
tion on this rule. If it fails, Repub-
licans will immediately bring to the 
floor a measure to reverse these disas-
trous policies. H.R. 6858 will greenlight 
the Keystone pipeline. It will fast- 
track leasing and permits to restore 
American production and independ-
ence. It will fast-track LNG facilities 
stalled under this administration. In 
short, it will restore the Republican 
policies that produced the affordable 
and plentiful gasoline that we took for 
granted just a few short years ago. 
But the sad fact is, we don’t have the 
votes to bring this measure to the 
floor, although we will try. That is up 
to the American people to change. 
Do you want to know who the real 
price gougers are? They are the Demo-
crat majority sitting on the other side 
of this aisle. If you voted for them, this 
is exactly what you voted for. If you 
are surprised by that, you weren’t pay-
ing much attention. The good news is, 
you can correct that mistake this No-
vember. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5020 
May 17, 2022 
We all know that Americans are feel-
ing pain at the gas pump, but Big Oil 
companies are raking in billions upon 
billions of dollars. They had record- 
breaking quarters about which they 
bragged to their shareholders during 
2021, with the top 25 companies making 
more than $205 billion in profits last 
year. 
As the war in Ukraine rages on, this 
is a time when we can all make 
choices, choices that reflect our moral 
fiber. Instead of choosing to do the 
right thing, oil and gas companies are 
choosing to take advantage of Amer-
ican consumers. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a May 7, 2022, USA Today article titled 
‘‘Oil giants reap record profits as war 
rages in Ukraine, energy prices soar: 
Here’s how much they made.’’ 
[From USA Today, May 7, 2022] 
OIL GIANTS REAP RECORD PROFITS
AS WAR 
RAGES IN UKRAINE, ENERGY PRICES SOAR: 
HERE’S HOW MUCH THEY MADE 
(By Wyatte Grantham-Philips) 
As households around the globe struggle 
with rising energy bills, some of the world’s 
leading oil giants reported record profits for 
the first three months of this year. 
Profits for Exxon Mobil, Shell and more 
also rose by billions despite significant costs 
of exiting operations and/or investments in 
Russia amid war in Ukraine. 
After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, 
the price of oil climbed in 2022’s first quar-
ter—as countries that rely heavily on Russia 
for energy scrambled for alternative fuel 
sources amid uncertainty. 
The benchmark for global oil prices, Brent 
crude, averaged at $102.23 a barrel during the 
first quarter—67 percent higher than during 
the same period last year, according to the 
Associated Press. In the United States, for 
example, drivers have consequently found in-
creasingly expensive gas prices at the pump. 
Home heating bills and electricity prices 
also 
inflated 
worldwide—as 
natural 
gas 
prices climbed from $3.50 per million British 
thermal units to about $5.60. 
High oil and gas prices have boosted the 
profits of major energy companies, further 
contributing to global inflation and the cost- 
of-living crisis. 
The net profit margin of S&P 500 compa-
nies, which include energy giants such as 
Chevron and Exxon Mobil, in the first quar-
ter has been running at 12.3 percent based on 
estimates and earnings reported so far, ac-
cording to FactSet. That’s down from a peak 
of 13.1 percent in the second quarter of last 
year, but above the pre-COVID–19 level of 
about 11 percent. 
‘‘Profit margins should be coming down,’’ 
Lindsay 
Owens, 
executive 
director 
of 
Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive 
economic policy research group, previously 
told 
USA 
TODAY. 
Instead, 
she 
noted, 
‘‘they’re actually growing.’’ 
Here’s a breakdown of the profits and earn-
ings some of the world’s oil giants made in 
the first three months of 2022: 
SHELL EARNINGS RISE TO $9.1 BILLION 
In the first quarter, Shell’s adjusted earn-
ings rose to $9.1 billion from $3.2 billion in 
the same period last year. Net income rose 
to $7.3 billion from $5.8 billion in last year’s 
first quarter. Shell said that it would also 
take a $3.9 billion charge to cover the cost of 
exiting investments in Russia, which the 
London-based energy giant pledged to do 
after the invasion of Ukraine. 
BP RECORDS $6.2 BILLION PROFIT 
BP posted its highest quarterly profit in 
over a decade—with the British energy com-
pany announcing on Tuesday that its under-
lying replacement cost profit rose to $6.2 bil-
lion in the first three months of this year, 
more than doubling the $2.6 billion from the 
same period last year. 
BP PLC also said its net loss in the first 
quarter totaled $23 billion, after accounting 
for a write-off of its nearly 20 percent stake 
in Russian oil producer Rosneft in response 
to the Ukraine war. 
Both BP and Shell’s recent profit reports 
have contributed to calls in Britain for the 
government to impose a tax on energy com-
panies’ windfall earnings, in hopes of helping 
consumers struggling with rising energy 
prices. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has re-
jected the idea, saying the tax would reduce 
investment in Britain during efforts to diver-
sify the country’s energy industry. 
The British government’s ‘‘refusal to tax 
the super-profits of energy companies is 
completely unforgivable when people are too 
terrified to heat their homes,’’ Ed Davey, 
leader of the Liberal Democrats, told the As-
sociated Press. 
EXXON DOUBLES PROFITS FROM LAST YEAR TO 
$5.48 BILLION 
At the end of April, Exxon Mobil reported 
$5.48 billion in profits during the first quar-
ter of 2022—also more than doubling its prof-
its compared with the same period last year. 
Revenue for the Irving, Texas-based com-
pany was $90.5 billion, far exceeding the rev-
enue of $59.15 billion during the same quarter 
in 2021. 
But, after abandoning Russian operations 
due to the war, Exxon also took a significant 
hit, writing down $3.4 billion. 
CHEVRON REPORTS $6.26 BILLION PROFIT 
Also at the end of April, Chevron reported 
a quarterly profit of $6.26 billion, over four 
times its earnings of $1.4 billion in the first 
quarter of last year. Revenue for the San 
Ramon, California-based energy producer 
surged 41 percent, to $54.37 billion. 
SINOPEC TOTALS $3.45 BILLION NET PROFIT 
According to Reuters, China Petroleum & 
Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, reported 22.61 bil-
lion yuan ($3.45 billion) net profit under Chi-
nese accounting standards for the first quar-
ter of 2022, compared to 17.93 billion yuan 
($2.69 billion) last year. 
Sinopec also saw a 25 percent surge in net 
income. 
PHILLIPS 66’S ADJUSTED EARNINGS OF $595 
MILLION 
For the first quarter of the year, Phillips 
66 reported first-quarter earnings of $582 mil-
lion, with adjusted earnings of $595 million. 
In 2021, Phillips 66 reported a first-quarter 
loss of $654 million, with an adjusted loss of 
$509 million. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER), my colleague on the 
Energy and Commerce Committee and 
a valuable member of the Republican 
Conference. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to oppose the previous ques-
tion so that we can immediately con-
sider H.R. 6858 to begin unleashing 
America’s energy dominance. 
From day one, from minute one of 
the Biden administration, the war on 
energy independence began. 
We all woke up this morning to see 
gas at $4.52 a gallon, the highest stick-
er price I have ever seen in my life-
time. The day President Biden took of-
fice, gas was a mere $2.38 a gallon. 
Policies have consequences, and we 
are feeling the consequences of the 
Biden administration’s decision to can-
cel the Keystone XL pipeline, restrict 
drilling on Federal lands, and increase 
our reliance on foreign dictators for oil 
and gas. 
Yet, somehow, this administration 
has learned nothing from the failures 
of their first year in office. Last week, 
President Biden again canceled off-
shore oil and gas lease sales off the 
Gulf and Alaskan coasts. This was a 
mere 2 days after he addressed the Na-
tion and blamed everyone but himself 
for the inflation crisis. 
The only thing lower than Biden’s 
approval 
rating 
is 
the 
purchasing 
power of the American dollar. Wash-
ington Democrats have the House. 
They have the Senate. They have the 
White House. No matter how much the 
President deflects the responsibility 
for our inflation crisis, it squarely falls 
on his shoulders. 
By bringing up H.R. 6858 for consider-
ation, Republicans are offering Demo-
crats the chance to correct the past 16 
months of America-last energy poli-
cies. 
Mr. Speaker, we must end our assault 
on our energy sector. Unlike the Demo-
crats’ socialist price-fixing act, this 
bill gets at the heart of our energy cri-
sis and takes steps to resolve it. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. GIMENEZ). 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the previous 
question so that we can immediately 
consider H.R. 6858, the American En-
ergy Independence from Russia Act. 
This administration’s insistence on 
destroying our energy independence 
has worsened the financial strain on 
American families, who have already 
been burdened by crushing inflation 
under the Biden administration, and 
weakened our national security pos-
ture by making us more reliant on for-
eign sources of energy. 
Thanks to the incompetence of the 
present 
administration 
and 
this 
House’s failure to secure America’s en-
ergy independence, Americans are left 
poorer, weaker, and with a bleaker out-
look toward their future. 
Mr. Speaker, it is pretty clear how 
we got to this point. The Biden admin-
istration’s efforts to weaken our Na-
tion’s energy security began on their 
very first day in office when the Presi-
dent canceled the Keystone XL pipe-
line. Since then, the administration 
has taken further action to discourage 
domestic oil production by halting 
leases for drilling on Federal lands, the 
latest of which came just last week 
when the Biden administration can-
celed another round of contracts in 
Alaska. 
These policies have forced our Presi-
dent to tap into the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to keep gas prices from 
rising even more, but it is not working.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5021 
May 17, 2022 
b 1315 
At a time when Russia is fueling this 
barbaric violence on the Ukrainian 
people through its gas exports, holding 
countries around the world hostage due 
to their reliance on Russian oil, we 
need to ensure the United States not 
only ends permanently all oil imports 
from Russia, but that the United 
States has a sustained domestic supply 
to supplant Russia as a leading net ex-
porter of oil. America, and the world, is 
safer when it is our country that is in 
charge of our own destiny. 
Passing the American Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act will also 
have a tremendous economic impact 
right here at home, at a time when our 
fuel costs continue to skyrocket and 
hurt the pockets of the American peo-
ple. Instead of taking the commonsense 
approach put forward by this legisla-
tion, the President and his allies in 
this House send diplomats to negotiate 
with tyrants and dictators, sworn en-
emies of America, such as Iran and 
Venezuela, seeking deals to import 
their oil to the United States. Ven-
ezuela, in particular, which sits on the 
world’s largest known oil reserves, can-
not even keep its own people fed or 
electricity running due to the malice 
of its socialist and Russian-allied lead-
ership. 
Just today, we learned that the Biden 
administration is looking to ease the 
sanctions on Venezuela in exchange for 
promises that the Maduro regime will 
enter into dialogue with its opposition. 
Unbelievable. 
Let’s end this nonsense and pass the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act. It is time the elected offi-
cials in this body, the ones elected to 
represent the American people, stop 
doing the bidding of our adversaries 
and promote domestic production of 
oil. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
move this extraordinarily important 
measure forward for our families and 
for our country’s safety. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank my 
colleagues who have come to the floor 
and spoken in favor of defeating the 
previous question in order to consider 
H.R. 6858, the American Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act. 
We have seen the damage that one- 
party rule has done in this town over 
the last 18 months and, unfortunately, 
the victims of that damage are the 
American people. So here, today, in 
this body, there is a chance to vote 
against the previous question and bring 
up this important amendment to begin 
to get some relief for the American 
people. 
In addition, back in 2014, the Work-
force Innovation and Opportunity Act, 
which is also the subject of this rule, 
was enacted on a bipartisan basis. But 
once again, one-party Democratic rule 
could not be satisfied with that, and 
our colleagues have blocked Repub-
lican efforts to try to improve the 2022 
version of this bill and find any sort of 
compromise. 
Our workforce development programs 
need to be modernized and modernized 
accurately in order to match the 
changing labor market. But this bill 
lacks the necessary reforms and, in-
stead, adds burdensome requirements 
and centralized governance to these 
many programs. This is not the way to 
prepare employers and potential em-
ployees to thrive in a post-pandemic 
world. 
Again, we have an opportunity to de-
feat the previous question and consider 
rationalizing our energy markets. I 
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous ques-
tion, a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on the underlying measures, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule should be 
an easy one for this Congress to pass, 
particularly if there were two parties 
here interested in solving problems 
rather than just pointing blame. 
It is clear that we need to reauthor-
ize the Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act. WIOA is an investment 
in ourselves. It is an investment in the 
American worker and the American 
economy. WIOA creates and propels 
economic opportunity, particularly for 
our youth. Passing the reauthorization 
bill will help millions of Americans get 
better jobs to support themselves and 
their families. It will make it easier for 
workers to get the skills and training 
needed to compete in the modern job 
market, and it will maintain our coun-
try’s competitiveness in the global 
economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote for the rule today and 
to support the underlying legislation. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1119 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
6858) to strengthen United States energy se-
curity, encourage domestic production of 
crude oil, petroleum products, and natural 
gas, and for other purposes. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
any amendment thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 9 Cause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6858. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the 
Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the min-
imum time for any electronic vote on 
the question of adoption of the resolu-
tion. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 221, nays

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE

OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
THAT THE UNITED STATES REC-
OGNIZES THE MOUNTING PER-

ON 
NUTRITION AND DIET 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BLUNT ROCHESTER). Pursuant to House 
Resolution 1119, H. Res. 1118 is consid-
ered as adopted. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1118 
Whereas obesity, type-2 diabetes, heart dis-
ease, cancer, and stroke are among the lead-
ing causes of death and disability nationwide 
and are inextricably linked to diet; 
Whereas poor diet and nutrition have led 
to epidemic levels of obesity in America, 
with nearly 40 percent of adults currently 
obese and models projecting that nearly 60 
percent of today’s children will be obese by 
the age of 35; 
Whereas nearly 10 percent of Americans 
suffer from type-2 diabetes and more than 
one-third have pre-diabetes, compared with 
less than 1 percent just 50 years ago, and 
these conditions can be prevented or re-
versed by the adoption of a healthy diet and 
an active lifestyle; 
Whereas diet-related cancers are on the 
rise among young adult populations; 
Whereas increasing rates of cardiovascular 
disease and diet-related cancers are contrib-
uting to the recent declines in life expect-
ancy of the United States population; 
Whereas the economic costs related to— 
(1) diagnosed diabetes exceed $300 billion 
per year; 
(2) obesity exceed $200 billion per year; and 
(3) cancer care exceed $180 billion per year; 
Whereas the Federal Government bears 
much of the cost of diet-related diseases as 
reflected by increased Medicare spending, 
which in 2019, totaled $800 billion, or more 
than 15 percent of all Federal spending; 
Whereas in the next 10 years, Medicare 
spending is expected to exceed $1 trillion; 
Whereas much of this increased Medicare 
spending is directly attributed to the rise of 
diet-related diseases, as 5 of the 8 most com-
mon conditions for the 60 million Medicare 
beneficiaries are diet-related, with one-third 
of Medicare spending alone devoted to diabe-
tes-related costs; 
Whereas the Federal Government also 
bears a substantial cost for training physi-
cians who treat patients with diet-related 
diseases, particularly through graduate med-
ical education as— 
(1) Medicare dollars provide the single 
largest Federal direct funding source for 
graduate medical education (GME), includ-
ing residency and fellowship programs, at an 
estimated $10.3 billion per year; and 
(2) the Federal Government also matches 
the Medicaid funds that more than 44 States 
have elected to allocate to GME programs; 
Whereas GME programs receiving Federal 
funding do not consistently include sub-
stantive curricular requirements or perform-
ance benchmarks relevant to diet or nutri-
tion; 
Whereas in the absence of Federal require-
ments, all levels of medical training are 
largely devoid of nutrition education for 
medical professionals— 
(1) at the Undergraduate Medical Edu-
cation (UME) level, medical schools devote 
on average only 19 hours to nutrition science 
and diet over 4 years, or less than one per-
cent of all lecture hours; 
(2) at the GME level, requirements for nu-
trition curriculum and competency are lim-
ited or absent from the educational stand-
ards for key medical specialties, set by the 
accrediting body, the Accreditation Council 
for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME); 
and 
(3) at the Continuing Medical Education 
(CME) level, no State requires physicians to 
take courses in nutrition and diet, though 37 
States require training in other areas of 
medicine; 
Whereas the lack of training in nutrition 
has contributed to a measurable deficiency 
in health professionals’ knowledge of how 
diet and food relates to health; for example, 
only 10 percent of surveyed cardiologists re-
port receiving more than minimal education 
in nutrition as part of their training; 
Whereas medical professionals have cited 
the lack of nutrition education as a barrier 
to effectively counseling patients on diet and 
nutrition and knowing when to refer pa-
tients to nutrition professionals, and only 14 
percent of surveyed primary care physicians 
report feeling adequately trained to offer nu-
trition guidance to their patients; 
Whereas patients reasonably expect their 
physicians and certain health care special-
ists to be reliable sources of knowledge re-
garding nutrition and diet, and are unaware 
that their physicians may be ill-equipped to 
even begin to provide useful dietary advice 
or to make appropriate referrals to nutrition 
professionals; and 
Whereas there exist numerous opportuni-
ties for policy interventions to include edu-
cation related to nutrition and diet at every 
level of medical training, at the direction of 
accrediting and testing bodies, State govern-
ments, and the Federal Government of the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House 
of Representatives that the United States 
should— 
(1) urge that medical schools, residency 
and fellowship programs, and other health 
professional training programs to incor-
porate meaningful nutrition education that 
demonstrates the connection between nutri-
tion and disease, and develops the skills nec-
essary 
to 
initiate 
meaningful 
nutrition 
interventions and referrals; 
(2) support research intended to— 
(A) assess the opportunity for nutrition 
education across healthcare professionals’ 
training; and 
(B) develop effective curricular interven-
tions to ensure competency in nutrition for 
physicians and other health professionals; 
(3) support the development and dissemina-
tion of best practices and curricular re-
sources to medical schools, residency and 
fellowship programs, and health professional 
training programs to support introducing or 
expanding nutrition education; and 
(4) raise awareness of the critical role that 
nutrition plays in the health of all patients 
and the responsibility of practicing physi-
cians, health professionals, and healthcare 
administrators 
to 
assist 
in 
promoting 
healthy choices; to offer patient education 
and counseling about nutrition.

evaluated.

from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on H.R. 7309, the Workforce Innovation 
and Opportunity Act of 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the Workforce Inno-
vation and Opportunity Act, or WIOA, 
is the backbone of our Nation’s work-
force development system. Each year, 
WIOA programs help working people 
across the country get the skills they 
need to find better-paying careers and 
help employers access a dedicated and 
skilled workforce. 
Unfortunately, our investment in 
workforce development has fallen sig-
nificantly over time. While the U.S. 
labor force has grown approximately 50 
percent over the last four decades, Fed-
eral investment in workforce develop-
ment has fallen by two-thirds when ad-
justed for inflation. Federal invest-
ment in workforce development has 
fallen by two-thirds. 
This underinvestment hurts workers, 
it hurts businesses, and it hurts our 
economy’s competitive edge. Other de-
veloped countries spend between one- 
half of 1 percent to 1 full percent of 
their gross domestic product on work-
force development. We spend only one- 
tenth of 1 percent. 
The Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act of 2022 addresses this 
chronic underinvestment so that we 
can finally meet the needs of workers 
and businesses, fill job openings with 
qualified workers, reduce supply chain 
shortages, and lower costs for families. 
By investing approximately $80 bil-
lion over the next 6 years, this legisla-
tion would more than double the num-
ber of people receiving training serv-
ices in fiscal year 2023 and allow us to 
train 1 million workers per year by 
2028. 
The legislation modernizes WIOA to 
help expand work opportunities for dis-
connected youth. It makes critical re-
forms to improve Job Corps, and it ex-
pands sector-based training so that we 
can train for entire sectors such as 
electric cars, trucking, and nurses. It 
strengthens community colleges’ ca-
pacity to help workers succeed in in- 
demand industries. It helps justice-in-
volved individuals re-enter the labor 
force and obtain sustainable career 
paths. 
Madam Speaker, if we want to keep 
our global competitive edge, if we want 
to lower costs, and if we want to accel-
erate our economic recovery, then we 
must pass the Workforce Innovation 
and Opportunity Act of 2022. 
This legislation is the product of a 
largely bipartisan, year-long effort, in-
cluding a bipartisan roundtable and 
three bipartisan hearings in our com-
mittee. While many of my counterparts 
across the aisle have voiced opposition 
to the size of the investments in the 
bill, I remain hopeful that all of my

May 17, 2022 
colleagues will join me in voting to 
stand with America’s workers. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair of 
the Higher Education and Workforce 
Investment Subcommittee, Ms. WIL-
SON, for her work on this critical pri-
ority, and I urge support of the legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, Republicans are 
committed 
to 
preparing 
America’s 
workforce for the 21st century. This re-
authorization of the Workforce Innova-
tion and Opportunity Act, WIOA, will 
not help our country live up to its po-
tential. In fact, this reauthorization 
moves our workplace development sys-
tem in the wrong direction. 
Our labor market is not facing a lack 
of job openings or a lack of workers. 
Currently there are 11.3 million open 
jobs, but unfortunately there are too 
few Americans with the skills needed 
to fill them effectively. That is why we 
need a robust workforce development 
system that will prepare workers for 
in-demand skills. 
During the Education and Labor 
Committee markup of H.R. 7309, Re-
publicans offered an amendment that 
would empower employers to respond 
to local economic needs; streamline 
the workforce development system by 
increasing local collaboration and put-
ting program qualification decisions at 
the State and local level; strengthen 
outcomes and accountability by adding 
evidence-based practices, maintaining 
common performance-based metrics, 
funding programs with a track record 
of success, and improving transparency 
measures; and reduce bureaucracy by 
requiring the Department of Labor to 
address regulatory bottlenecks. 
b 1430 
Democrats blocked all those com-
monsense proposals. 
Republicans also pushed to allocate 
more funds for upskilling workers and 
support 
robust 
postsecondary 
edu-
cation programs that focus on in-de-
mand skills. Instead of embracing in-
novative models, Democrats rely on an 
85-year-old 
Federal 
apprenticeship 
model from the Great Depression. This 
model has not been working and throw-
ing more money at it won’t change 
that. 
Our Nation’s job creators are in a far 
better position to help run workforce 
development programs, but this bill 
puts Washington in the driver’s seat. 
Instead of putting workers first, this 
legislation 
makes 
bureaucrats 
and 
labor unions the priority. 
For example, provisions in this bill 
increase the size of State and local gov-
erning boards and dilute employer 
input to increase the power of labor 
unions. Too often, labor unions have 
the interests of their union bosses in 
mind instead of the interests of work-
ers. Giving big labor an outsized role 
on these boards will render these pro-
grams 
less 
responsive 
to 
industry 
needs. 
H.R. 7309 also promotes progressive 
gender ideology and critical race the-
ory by requiring States to develop and 
publish State equity reports regarding 
performance outcomes on race, eth-
nicity, sexual orientation, and gender 
identity. Leave it to the left to destroy 
equality in pursuit of equity, a word 
one author aptly described as ‘‘dis-
pensing unequal treatment in order to 
achieve equal outcomes.’’ Taking the 
focus of our job programs off upskilling 
workers and putting it onto a woke 
agenda will do a disservice to all our 
jobseekers. 
This legislation also increases cum-
bersome administrative hurdles for em-
ployers. If we want employers to par-
ticipate in these programs, we need a 
system that has fewer barriers and is 
easier to navigate. This process should 
be streamlined instead of making it 
more complex. 
Instead of making this program more 
efficient, provisions in this reauthor-
ization will end up costing taxpayers 
more. H.R. 7309 will require Job Corps 
contractors to comply with onerous 
local prevailing wage requirements. 
This will significantly increase the 
cost of all Job Corps projects without 
improving the program’s effectiveness. 
On top of that, the bill weakens ex-
pectations for Job Corps’ success. Job 
Corps is a program that has been 
fraught with negative issues for dec-
ades. This is a program in which 30 dif-
ferent government reports and audits 
have raised concerns over its safety 
and security. People have literally 
been killed in this program, and the 
left wants to make it less accountable. 
Other provisions in the bill water down 
performance 
metrics, 
reducing 
the 
ability of Congress to measure the suc-
cess of workforce development pro-
grams. 
More accountability and measurable 
outcomes are clearly necessary. Ac-
cording to a 2018 investigation by the 
Tampa Bay Times, some local work-
force 
boards 
had 
significantly 
misreported their outcomes and took 
credit for finding thousands of jobs for 
people who never even participated in 
the program. 
Other data demonstrate that these 
programs are not always effective, even 
when being operated honestly. Less 
than one-quarter of young enrollees 
and barely one-third of adults exited 
programs with occupations related to 
the workforce development program in 
which they were enrolled. Clearly, 
something isn’t working. Let me re-
peat: Fewer than 25 percent of young 
enrollees and only 30 percent of adults 
came out of the programs into jobs re-
lated to the workforce development 
program in which they were enrolled. 
If we hope to enhance our Nation’s 
economic competitiveness and upskill 
workers for in-demand jobs, we must 
create a workforce development sys-
tem that actually works. This bill ut-
terly fails to do that. The American 
people deserve so much better. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), 
the chair of the Subcommittee on Civil 
Rights and Human Services. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for yielding and 
for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act of 2022. This impor-
tant legislation improves the existing 
statute in several critical ways. 
First, this legislation formally au-
thorizes sector partnerships. I have 
witnessed the significant benefit of sec-
tor partnerships. One persuasive exam-
ple in northwest Oregon is the Oregon 
Manufacturing 
Innovation 
Center, 
OMIC, which develops and applies ad-
vanced metals manufacturing tech-
nologies in their R&D center, while 
educating an advanced manufacturing 
workforce in their training center run 
by Portland Community College. OMIC 
is an outstanding example of how sec-
tor 
partnerships 
between 
industry, 
higher education, and government can 
create new R&D outcomes, prepare 
workers, and fuel local economies. 
Second, this legislation will improve 
access to supportive services like ac-
cess to tools, work attire, transpor-
tation, 
childcare, 
and 
mentorship, 
which are crucial to helping workers 
stay in their training and in the work-
place and to thrive. 
Third, this legislation will define and 
formally authorize funding for pre-ap-
prenticeship programs. In Oregon, we 
have tremendous programs, successful 
programs, like Oregon Tradeswomen, 
that prepare women for careers and 
trades through pre-apprenticeships. De-
spite the success of this program and 
others, funding has been extremely 
low. This legislation will help expand 
these life-changing programs and set 
participants up for success in appren-
ticeships and beyond. These are life- 
changing. 
Importantly, this legislation will 
make Job Corps more inclusive by re-
quiring Job Corps center operators to 
implement a tiered disciplinary system 
instead of adhering to a zero-tolerance 
drug policy. It would expand the defini-
tion of ‘‘individuals with barriers to 
employment’’ to include historically 
disadvantaged 
communities. 
These 
changes will modernize Job Corps in 
important ways, and it will better 
meet the needs of all communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act 
reauthorization to help close the skills 
gap and to address the needs of work-
ing Americans, and I thank Chairman 
SCOTT for his leadership in bringing 
this important bill to the floor. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN).

thorization bill. This is one of these big

bills that is 268 pages. I don’t have time 
to go through all of the problems with 
the bill, but I am just going to touch 
on some highlights, or low lights. 
In this area of high inflation, with a 
bill like this, the first thing I look at 
is the cost. The cost of this bill—right 
now, we are spending about $9.9 billion 
on this topic. Over the next 6 years, 
they expect it to increase to $16.2 bil-
lion. You are looking at a 63 percent 
increase in spending on this area at a 
time where we really don’t have any 
money to increase anything. So I want 
the American public to understand 
there is a big spending increase here. 
Secondly, I will talk about a very im-
portant population to me, though a 
population that is not talked about 
enough, and that is the fact that we are 
continuing to allow a provision in law 
which I think is damaging to people 
born with different abilities. Right 
now, they are not able to work at work 
centers, which is one of these places 
that sometimes pays under minimum 
wage, until they are at least 24 years 
old. We would never tell anybody of 
other abilities that you are not allowed 
to work until you are age 24. But by 
making it—I won’t say impossible, but 
very difficult to work at a work center 
until age 24, I think you stunt the peo-
ple’s growth. 
I was really hoping we would use this 
opportunity to allow people with dif-
ferent abilities to begin to work at 18 
or 19 years old. Anybody who tours 
these work centers cannot help but be 
touched by how proud these folks are 
to work there. I wish they could work 
there at age 18 instead of 24. 
The next thing I will point out is a 
clear feature of this bill is to dramati-
cally expand Job Corps; in other words, 
government jobs that are a stepping-
stone, I guess, if you can’t find another 
job. There has never been a time, I 
think, in American history in which 
they are looking for more people to 
work. So as I go around my district, be 
it the service industry, agriculture, 
light manufacturing, they are begging 
for employees. What is Congress going 
to do? They are going to go in there 
and say, no, we are not going to let you 
work at the local restaurant; we are 
going to have you work for Job Corps. 
I think that is a mistake. 
The fourth thing I will point out is 
this obsession with racial biases and 
gender identity. There is a bill right 
now that the majority party has that is 
called the LGBT Data Inclusion Act, in 
which they expect everybody, I guess, 
to tell their employer what their sex-
ual preferences are. I have been doing 
this job in politics for a long time. I 
have never had a discussion about sex-
ual preferences with any of my employ-
ees. I would feel embarrassed to ask 
them. But this bill clearly implies a 
world in which when you apply for a 
job, let’s talk about our sexual iden-
tity. 
The fifth thing I point out is we have 
a big problem in this country at our 
southern border. In this bill, in com-
mittee, we tried to have E-Verify to 
apply to all of these jobs; in other 
words, to make sure that if we are 
going to have such a program, at least 
it is American citizens who take ad-
vantage of the program. That amend-
ment was shot down in committee. 
What does that tell me? It tells me 
that one more time, along with free 
medical care, along with Pell grants, 
the majority party wants to help out 
people who are coming here who 
shouldn’t 
be 
here. 
E-Verify 
really 
should have been part of the bill. I 
don’t think the American public wants 
another government program designed, 
at least in part, to benefit people who 
are here illegally. 
Those are some of the greatest hits of 
the bill. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. MRVAN), a 
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Work-
force Innovation and Opportunity Act 
of 2022. 
I have long believed that there is a 
role for public servants to create the 
conditions that help our fellow citizens 
obtain a good-paying job. With a good- 
paying job, most folks have the time 
and the resources to take care of them-
selves, their families, and address the 
difficulties that sometimes arise in 
life. 
I appreciate that this legislation pro-
motes the value of our workforce and 
focuses on the improvements to ap-
prenticeship programs, digital literacy 
programs, and summer job programs 
for our youth. 
In my experience for 15 years as 
someone who helped upskill people, I 
worked very closely with workforce de-
velopment in order to find jobs for peo-
ple who are sitting across the table 
from me trying to make ends meet. 
This investment gives them hope and 
promise. It also absolutely addresses 
what all employers and all small busi-
nesses are looking for: a ready, skilled 
workforce in order to be able to get 
into the market quickly. 
When it comes to labor unions, I em-
phasize the investment in our labor 
unions. What they provide for my com-
munity, in Indiana’s First District, is 
livable wages, healthcare benefits that 
are affordable, safer workplaces, and 
secure retirement. 
When it comes to the prevailing 
wage, that prevailing wage sets a wage 
that allows for all programs and all de-
velopment in my district. That is 
something that is sacred that allows us 
to be competitive, to have a safe work-
place, and allows us to provide for fam-
ilies. 
Northwest Indiana is home to such a 
diverse and talented workforce, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
this legislation so that communities 
and organizations throughout our Na-
tion have the resources to ensure that 
everyone has the opportunity and tools 
to thrive in our economy. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member FOXX for her work 
and leadership on these important 
issues and for visiting my home State 
of Arkansas many times in support of a 
better workforce. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 7309 due to its lack of in-
novation and lack of opportunity that 
I think is embedded in this legislation. 
It is a shame we are on the floor, yet 
again, debating a bill that the Demo-
cratic 
majority 
crafted 
to 
please 
unions and bolster them at the expense 
of American workers, small businesses, 
and nonunion entities. 
b 1445 
Most employers want to provide 
work-based upskilling, but they are al-
ready hesitant to apply for Federal 
funds. This bill will make that process 
even more complex and burdensome. 
In my home State of Arkansas, we 
are a right-to-work State. This bill is 
harmful to my home State. 
There are many bad policies embed-
ded in the bill that will harm the 
American workforce. This bill will ex-
pand Federal control over workforce 
standards, limiting the rights of job-
seekers. It will do this while man-
dating that union representation on 
State and local workforce development 
boards be expanded by 10 percent. Most 
importantly, this bill will fail to ex-
pand opportunity access for jobseekers. 
It is clear that this bill was written 
to favor unions, not the full and di-
verse American workforce. This bill is 
deeply flawed and another example of 
the Democratic majority being out of 
touch with working Americans. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT), a distinguished member of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
after more than 2 years of instability 
during the pandemic, Congress must 
ensure that all Americans—all Ameri-
cans—have resources to access the job 
market, especially those who are typi-
cally left behind. 
Each year, 600,000 individuals are re-
leased from incarceration, and nearly 
half of them have repeat contact with 
the criminal justice system within a 
year. There is a critical need to invest 
in reentry programs. The Workforce In-
novation and Opportunity Act of 2022 
does just that by guaranteeing the De-
partment of Labor’s Reentry Employ-
ment Opportunities program is author-
ized at $500 billion by 2028. 
This investment will not only expand 
reentry 
employment 
assistance 
for 
adults, 
but 
also 
prevent 
in-school 
youth from dropping out of school, in-
crease the employment rate of out-of- 
school youth, and reduce the involve-
ment of youth in crime and violence. 
Programs carried out through the re-
entry employment grant program rec-

healthy and constructive lives. These 
resources can mean the difference be-
tween a revolving door of prison time 
or a life full of economic opportunities. 
For those reasons, Madam Speaker, 
and all the other significant provisions 
in this bill, such as building commu-
nity college capacity and strength-
ening industry and sector partnership, 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act of 2022. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in FY 2021, tax-
payers spent about $1.8 billion on 
adult, dislocated worker, and youth ac-
tivities under title I of WIOA. Accord-
ing to the Department of Labor, only 
$537 million, or less than 30 percent of 
that money, went toward ‘‘training 
services.’’ 
Most people assume that our Na-
tion’s workforce development system is 
primarily focused on providing workers 
the skills they need to be successful in 
the modern economy. Unfortunately, 
that is not accurate. 
Not surprisingly, with so little focus 
on actual skills development, the out-
comes for these programs are poor. 
Among youth participants, less than 
one-quarter exited the program with 
employment in an occupation related 
to the services they received from the 
system. Among adults and dislocated 
workers, a little more than one-third 
exited with employment related to 
their program. 
Republicans would like to address 
these shortcomings and believe this re-
authorization presents an opportunity 
to do that. The Republican proposal we 
offered during committee, and to the 
Rules Committee, increases the per-
centage of funding going toward skills 
development. We proposed reforms to 
bring more employers to the table and 
engage more employers in the work-
force system. 
Unfortunately, the Democrats’ bill 
rejects those proposals and, instead, 
would actually make these problems 
worse. As a result of provisions in H.R. 
7309, an even smaller portion of WIOA 
funding will be directed toward skills 
development. 
The bill will also dilute employers’ 
involvement in State and local govern-
ance of the workforce system, which is 
the opposite of what we should be 
doing. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is a missed 
opportunity. I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the base bill so we can get back 
to work and truly reform this program 
to get more workers the skills they 
need to fill the economy’s open jobs. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURT-
NEY), a distinguished member of the 
Committee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act, which will modernize America’s 
job training program at precisely the 
time that we need it the most. 
Today in America, for every one un-
employed person, there are two job 
openings. Again, I don’t care what sec-
tor you are talking about, whether it is 
manufacturing, 
whether 
it 
is 
healthcare, whether it is information 
technology, whether you are from a red 
State or a blue State, the hue and cry 
from employers who are desperate to 
find workers is one of the most power-
ful challenges that we face in this 
economy. It is a good challenge. It is 
about connecting people to opportuni-
ties and to jobs or careers, which this 
bill is precisely designed to do. 
Again, if you want to talk about the 
problems that we are having with infla-
tion and gas prices, well, listen to the 
oil and gas industry. They are 100,000 
workers short today, so they cannot in-
crease supply because they don’t have 
the workforce to do the drilling that is 
necessary. 
In my district, where I have Electric 
Boat’s shipyard, which has used the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act in the past, there are 725 job open-
ings this morning in the metal trades, 
in design and engineering work. The 
existing Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act, which, again, uses the 
collaboration of employers and unions 
to design a curriculum that matches 
the work that happens in that ship-
yard, in the metal trades and other 
areas, has been extremely successful. 
They graduated their 2,000th graduate, 
who immediately was employed and is 
working in that shipyard. Again, that 
is going to be a career for that indi-
vidual to support themselves and their 
family. 
The challenge we have before us is we 
need to size up that preapprenticeship 
critical link that this program address-
es by passing this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Connecticut. 
Mr. COURTNEY. If you read the bill, 
it doubles the number of slots that 
workforce boards like mine in eastern 
Connecticut, and the 500 workforce 
boards that exist around the country 
will again then be able to address that 
critical need that exists right now 
today. It does it in a way that has been 
on the books since the Clinton admin-
istration passed the Workforce Invest-
ment Act back in the 1990s. 
Again, my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle were part of the bill 
signing with President Obama in 2014 
when we authorized it the last time. 
This bill is very much aligned with the 
structure, but it enlarges it, and it 
reaches out to underserved populations 
and other individuals who can take ad-
vantage of and succeed with the tools 
that this bill will provide. 
Again, now is the time. We need to 
vote on this measure today. We need to 
get it through the Senate, and our 
economy will benefit. Our Nation will 
benefit. Vote in favor of the Workforce 
Innovation and Opportunity Act. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, could you advise as to how 
much time is remaining on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 18 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
North Carolina has 153⁄4 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), a 
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act of 2022. 
As Michigan’s former chief workforce 
officer, I know firsthand how vital job 
training is to help communities trans-
form economic challenges into oppor-
tunities for all. 
About 15 years ago, during the crisis 
in the auto industry, and then during 
the Great Recession, we created what, 
at the time, was the largest job train-
ing program of any State, called No 
Worker Left Behind. We put 162,000 un- 
and underemployed Michiganians back 
to school to study for in-demand jobs, 
certificates, degrees, whatever their 
local workforce board said was needed. 
Lord knows, as Mr. COURTNEY said, at 
this moment, when employers are cry-
ing out for trained workers to fill posi-
tions, we need to pass this bill. 
Let me touch on four highlights of 
the legislation. 
First, it corrects years of under-
funding by authorizing $74 billion over 
the next 6 years. 
Second, it gives greater voice to 
workers by increasing representation 
of labor organizations on State and 
local workforce boards. 
Third, it makes permanent and allo-
cates $2.25 billion over 6 years for the 
Labor Department’s Reentry Employ-
ment Opportunities program so that 
returning citizens can both obtain and 
sustain employment. We are seeing em-
ployers go into prisons in innovative 
ways and help people have opportuni-
ties for hope in their life, which is the 
surest way to cut recidivism. 
Fourth, it authorizes public libraries 
to serve as affiliated one-stop sites, a 
priority I pushed to include in the leg-
islation. Madam Speaker, I am always 
about those public libraries. 
Effective workforce training is a cru-
cial tool to spur job creation, fight 
long-term unemployment, and reduce 
inequality. By increasing funding and 
giving workers of all backgrounds a 
stronger voice, this proposal strength-
ens our workforce development system. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Chairman SCOTT on his leadership in 
shepherding this legislation, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote for the Work-
force Innovation and Opportunity Act 
of 2022.

Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this is 
just one of the things that the Caucus 
and the Congress have been doing to 
help make the economy improve and 
help people deal with problems that 
COVID has caused us, supply chain and 
all, which has slowed down the oppor-
tunity to get products, and also causes 
inflation, but having the Workforce In-
novation and Opportunity Act to get 
people training, get them career serv-
ices, get skills to perform jobs is so im-
portant. 
I think it was Mr. COURTNEY who 
mentioned how many more openings 
we have than people to fill the jobs 
right now. I went to Walgreens the 
other day and thought I got there early 
to get the drive-in, and they said: ‘‘We 
don’t have enough employees to have 
the drive-in open this morning.’’ 
Everywhere you go, there is need for 
work, so we need to train people so 
they can fill the jobs that are made 
available. 
I am proud to vote for this bill, reau-
thorizing the program, which, unfortu-
nately, expired in 2020. This would put 
us back on track and invest $78 billion 
over 6 years and retrain millions of 
workers per year by 2028. 
Memphis is a proud working-class 
city, and we must prepare our work-
force and our community for the 21st 
century and for the jobs right now. The 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act will ensure that critical resources 
are provided for essential institutions 
like our Benjamin L. Hooks Job Corps 
Center in Whitehaven. 
This transformational work should 
involve all of our local leaders and re-
sources to ensure our programs and so-
lutions are relevant and useful to our 
community. I offered an amendment, 
which was accepted, and I appreciate 
that. It will help ensure the subject 
matter experts in local agencies, local 
educators, and community leaders can 
be included as part of the workforce de-
velopment boards. We look out for each 
other in Memphis, and we want to see 
us move forward in the 21st century. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage every-
body to vote for this bill.

Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CART-
WRIGHT). 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
about my critical amendment to the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act. 
As a Nation, what we want to do is 
help our young working population 
find jobs and meet their career poten-
tial. That is exactly what YouthBuild 
has done for the last 40 years. 
The YouthBuild program funds work-
force training initiatives focused on 16- 
to 24-year-old individuals without a 
high school diploma. These young 
adults come from challenging back-
grounds and they need skills and re-
sources to successfully participate in 
the 
domestic 
labor 
market, 
and 
YouthBuild gives them just that oppor-
tunity. 
However, there is always room for 
improvement—and that is why we have 
this amendment—especially when it 
comes to ensuring that young adults 
with disabilities are best positioned to 
successfully enter the workforce. Cur-
rently, lack of affordable and acces-
sible transportation creates significant 
barriers for disabled people that want 
to work. 
Madam Speaker, 13.4 million Ameri-
cans have disabilities which limit their 
ability to travel, including traveling to 
the workplace. We have to ensure that 
transportation to and from the work-
place is available for disabled youth 
transitioning into the workforce. 
My amendment to the Workforce In-
novation and Opportunity Act allows 
disabled YouthBuild participants to 
use funds for transportation. With this 
amendment, we can remove a massive 
obstacle from the path of these dis-
abled young adults. We can make going 
to work one step easier so they can 
earn a living and support their fami-
lies. No American should be deprived of 
a fair chance to become and remain 
productive members of our American 
society. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my fellow 
Members to support my amendment 
and allow designated YouthBuild fund-
ing to be used for work-related trans-
portation. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, at the appropriate 
time, I will offer an amendment to H.R. 
7309, which will increase skills develop-
ment for individuals seeking careers in 
law enforcement, especially in these 
States that we have seen increasing 
violent crime. 
My amendment would modify the list 
of employment and workforce develop-
ment activities that States must carry 
out with State set-aside funding under 
the Adult and Dislocated Worker Pro-
grams. 
This amendment requires that States 
that have experienced an increase in 
violent crime over the previous year 
use those State set-aside funds to pro-
vide training services for individuals 
seeking a career in law enforcement. 
Those funds must also support training 
services for law enforcement involved 
in border protection in relevant States. 
After 2 years of my colleagues across 
the aisle calling to defund the police, 
we are seeing cities in America in cri-
sis. Police agency budgets have been 
slashed, making it impossible to hire, 
equip, and train officers. These calls 
have demoralized and delegitimized of-
ficers, causing high attrition rates and 
making it nearly impossible to hire 
new officers. 
Criminals have noticed, and violent 
crime is rising because of it. Just look 
at the news any night. It has made the 
already dangerous job of law enforce-
ment even more dangerous and unsafe. 
And in 2021, an officer was attacked 
and killed every five days in America. 
Madam Speaker, all our communities 
are less safe because of it. This Police 
Week, instead of focusing on sup-
porting law enforcement’s hiring and 
retention and making our communities 
safer, my colleagues are forcing a par-
tisan, flawed approach to labor force 
development. But my amendment will 
help build the workforce that we really 
need to focus on, and that is peace offi-
cers. 
At a time when law enforcement re-
tirements are up 45 percent nationwide, 
and some cities still can’t fill up to 17 
percent of their open positions, we des-
perately need to invest in retraining 
law enforcement officers. 
As a former law enforcement officer 
myself, I know firsthand the impor-
tance of developing a strong pipeline of 
law enforcement cadets. We are far 
from that now so we must direct our 
Federal workforce investments to ca-
reer fields that directly and positively 
impact the safety of our communities 
across America. 
If we adopt the motion to recommit, 
we will instruct the Committee on 
Education and Labor to consider my 
amendment to invest in the next gen-
eration of our law enforcement offi-
cers. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mrs. 
HAYES), a distinguished member of the 
Committee on Education and Labor. 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to support the passage of this bill, the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act, a historic, $78 billion investment, 
which will provide training for 1 mil-
lion workers per year by 2028. This 
package 
includes 
my 
bill, 
the 
YouthBuild for the Future Act, which 
would invest $1 billion into YouthBuild 
over 6 years. 
YouthBuild is a crucial program that 
is specifically built to help young peo-
ple who have not completed their high 
school degree train for a high-wage, 
stable career. But most importantly, it 
helps those young people regain their 
confidence and their ability to be self- 
sufficient and contribute to our com-
munities. 
My bill makes critical investments 
to the program, such as reserving grant

funds for rural areas, extending the pe-
riod of follow-up services to 2 years, 
and allowing YouthBuild to fund meals 
for participants. These improvements 
will expand opportunity for young 
adults and employers who are clam-
oring to fill skilled positions that too 
often remain vacant. 
These are meaningful, life-changing 
investments for Americans searching 
for long-term, high-wage employment. 
I know that these programs work be-
cause the one in my district and my 
hometown has young kids building 
homes. 
Madam Speaker, as an original co-
sponsor of this reauthorization, I am 
proud to support passage, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, by reversing some 
of the key reforms made in the bipar-
tisan 2014 WIOA reauthorization, H.R. 
7309 takes our workforce system back-
wards. It does this by imposing more 
bureaucratic hurdles to job creators 
and reducing program accountability. 
It is time to stop being so frivolous 
with taxpayer dollars. 
This 
bill 
proposes 
pouring 
more 
money into an already expensive pro-
gram. In FY 2021, taxpayers spent $1.8 
billion on programs under title 1 of 
WIOA alone. This is too much money, 
especially as inflation is still at a 41- 
year high. 
The House of Representatives has 
been entrusted with the power of the 
purse. It is time we took this responsi-
bility more seriously. The Nation de-
serves a workforce system that will ac-
tually prepare Americans for in-de-
mand jobs. Unfortunately, this bill 
fails to protect taxpayers at a time of 
rampant inflation, pushes a radical 
progressive agenda, expands Federal 
control over the workforce, and em-
braces that failed status quo rather 
than pursuing opportunities for inno-
vation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, the evidence is clear 
that our economy has made meaningful 
progress toward recovering from the 
pandemic. Thanks to the efforts of 
Congress and the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration, our economy has added a 
record 8.3 million jobs since the start 
of 2021, and the unemployment rate has 
fallen to 3.6 percent. 
Despite this progress, we know that 
job openings currently exceed job ap-
plicants and employers are clamoring 
for skilled workers. In fact, research 
suggests that workers are leaving their 
job to seek better career opportunities 
in record numbers. This bill takes a 
critical step forward to empower work-
ers to fill those competitive job posi-
tions and, in turn, helps reduce supply 
chain shortages, lower costs for fami-
lies, increase their incomes, and im-
prove our business competitiveness. 
Madam Speaker, investing in work-
force 
development 
has 
historically 
been a priority for both Democrats and 
Republicans. That is why our com-
mittee conducted an extended bipar-
tisan process to put this legislation to-
gether, despite the opposition we have 
heard from our colleagues today. 
As our economy rebounds from the 
pandemic, we should all agree that we 
must take this opportunity to expand 
access to high-quality job training op-
portunities for America’s workers. 
I thank my colleague again, Ms. WIL-
SON, for her leadership in bringing this 
critical legislation to the floor, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act of 2022. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, H.R. 7309, 
the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
of 2022, makes significant improvements to 
WIOA, the law that is the backbone of our na-
tion’s workforce development system. Since 
2014, WIOA has provided training and career 
services to help working people across the 
country get the skills they need and help em-
ployers secure a qualified workforce. 
H.R. 7309 also includes legislation I au-
thored that extends three crucial workforce de-
velopment programs to the Marianas: the 
Wagner-Peyser grant, the Integrated English 
Literacy and Civic Education grant, and the 
Job Corps program. Under my Employment 
Services and Jobs Parity Act, the annual 
$300,000 Wagner-Peyser grant would provide 
skill assessment, career guidance, and refer-
rals to training to job seekers in the Marianas. 
The legislation additionally allows the Com-
monwealth government to apply for Employ-
ment Service formula grants, at the same per-
centage share as Guam, to set up One-Stop 
Career Centers that can help workers find jobs 
and employers find workers. Under my Inte-
grated English Literacy and Civic Education 
Nationwide Act, English language learners 
would acquire the proficiency needed to obtain 
employment. And under my Job Corps Nation-
wide Act, Job Corps centers can be estab-
lished in all insular areas. This means our 
young people would not have to leave the 
Marianas to get necessary training and local 
business would benefit from a skilled work-
force connected to our community and com-
mitted to remaining. All my bills support the 
overall goal of H.R. 7309: to help job seekers 
nationwide access quality employment, edu-
cation training, and support services. 
By reauthorizing and strengthening WIOA’s 
programs, H.R. 7309 will help Americans get 
back to work. In addition to my provisions, the 
legislation expands summer and year-round 
jobs programs for youth, codifies partnerships 
between employers and community colleges, 
and provides funding for innovative ap-
proaches to workforce development. 
At a time when the COVID–19 pandemic 
has diminished the resources necessary to 
train new workers, the improvements to WIOA 
under H.R. 7309 will continue to develop the 
workforce pipeline and expand access to serv-
ices for the people who need them the most. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Work-
force Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, H.R. 
7309 is truly transformational legislation that 
will have a profound impact on workforce de-
velopment and job skills training for decades 
to come. By virtue of this legislation, the 
American economy will be well positioned for 
success in emerging industries as well as tra-
ditional jobs in an increasingly competitive 
global landscape. 
With the new initiatives and support for state 
and local efforts that this bill provides, more 
institutions will be able to provide education 
and job training services; a wider range of cur-
ricula will be available that enables learners to 
become job-ready; and more Americans will 
be equipped with skills that will jump-start 
long-term careers. 
Very importantly, this bill will extend the 
reach of job skills training and employment 
preparation to all corners of the country and 
all segments of society. It does so by creating 
vital national programs and instituting account-
ability systems that will monitor program oper-
ations and success. 
This legislation also ensures that students 
will have access to training through online dig-
ital platforms. Use of e-learning opens the 
doors for education even where cultural bar-
riers and long distances from brick-and-mortar 
institutes often had the effect of excluding 
many Americans. 
As enthusiastic as I am about this legislation 
and its comprehensive approach toward ele-
vating our country’s workforce preparation in-
frastructure, there are additional elements that 
I believed were necessary. We must ensure 
that diversity, inclusion, and equity are always 
cornerstones of our economy and society; and 
ensure that this bill will prepare all demo-
graphic groups with our workforce for success 
in key industries that are vital to our nation’s 
future economy. 
As a result, I submitted amendments to the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 
and I am delighted that the Rules Committee 
agreed that these were important additions to 
H.R. 7309. I would like to share a few 
thoughts with my colleagues and the American 
people about my two amendments which are 
being considered by the House of Representa-
tives today. 
My first amendment stems from my fervent 
and long-held belief that women and girls 
should have a level playing field for any type 
of study, job, or career. Throughout my life, I 
have fought for women and girls to have equal 
opportunity to learn in classrooms, excel in 
workplaces, and achieve in life. 
Where women faced walls, I sought to tear 
down the walls or lean a ladder against them 
to climb over. When girls were being discour-
aged from educational or career pursuits, I set 
out to change mindsets. When females faced 
biases or glass ceilings that restrained suc-
cess, I organized and marched to level the 
playing field. 
As a result, my first amendment would en-
sure that women and girls are encouraged to 
enroll for STEM education, that is, the study of 
science, technology, engineering, and math. 
These subjects are the key to success in a 
vast range of industries and professions, es-
pecially in this advanced era in which informa-
tion and technology propels most innovations 
and program. Women and girls must be wel-
comed for a seat at those tables, which will 
dramatically impact gender equality over time. 
In addition to being encouraged to enroll, I 
believe girls and women should receive pri-
ority for both the study of these fields and the

jobs and careers that await them, and that 
support services should be provided to them 
along the way to help ensure their success. 
The days of male-dominated stem-based in-
dustries must be relegated to history books, 
as that bias has no place in modern America. 
Because of entrenched, long-standing dis-
crimination against women and girls, not only 
do we need equality; we also need equity. In 
other words, more must be done to right the 
wrongs of the past, prioritize participation by 
women and girls, and fast-track us for pro-
motions, advancement, and success. 
My second amendment is rooted in similar 
concerns. It insists that this legislation help all 
Americans, specifically communities of color 
that historically did not benefit equally from 
workforce development and job skills training 
programs. My amendment would ensure that 
HBCUs and other minority-serving educational 
institutions are eligible and encouraged to 
apply for maximal benefits under H.R. 7309’s 
programs. 
Moreover, beyond just equality, the job 
training and workforce development programs 
at these institutions should be given priority in 
order to promote equity for students whose 
ancestors were denied that right. H.R. 7309 
can be the impetus for a fresh start. 
By including and prioritizing HBCUs and 
other minority-serving institutions, the institu-
tionalized barriers which impeded generational 
prosperity will be eroded, even if only incre-
mentally and over many years. By leveling the 
playing field, the imbalance of generational 
wealth will also be rectified. 
Madam Speaker, I believe these two 
amendments are central to the purpose of the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 
and will strengthen the bill both legislatively 
and in practice across the country. Diversity 
and inclusion must always be a priority par-
ticularly in future high-growth industries that 
are essential to our nation’s long-term eco-
nomic growth, success, and and job creation 
strategy.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1119, the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this en bloc con-
tains several bipartisan amendments 
from our colleagues to continue im-
proving the Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act of 2022. 
This en bloc contains commonsense 
proposals that strengthen the under-
lying bill, and I thank my colleagues 
for their contributions. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge sup-
port for both the en bloc and the under-
lying bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this en bloc in-
cludes several amendments that I be-
lieve would improve the underlying 
legislation so I will vote for the en 
bloc. 
Unfortunately, I must also note that 
the en bloc includes three amendments 
to which I have concerns. 
The Gottheimer amendment reduces 
the flexibility the workforce system 
needs to meet the needs of workers. 
The Harder amendment will reduce 
the percentage of funds going to help 
youth receive the skills they need to 
enter the workforce. 
And the Lee amendment authorizes a 
duplicative study that would not be a 
reasonable use of taxpayer funds. 
However, on balance, this en bloc will 
improve the underlying legislation. 
This group of amendments better fo-
cuses WIOA on in-demand jobs, de-
creases duplication by encouraging 
better alignment between K–12 edu-
cation providers and local workforce 
development boards, and includes in-
formation on entrepreneurship in ca-
reer and skills development services. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will support this set of amend-
ments, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Energy 
and Water Development of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, and a strong 
supporter of sector grant training. 
b 1515 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for his astound-
ing leadership on this critical jobs 
training bill and for yielding me time. 
I thank Ranking Member FOXX so very 
much for her support of this effort. 
Today, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port a bipartisan amendment to the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act that I have proposed alongside 
Representatives KELLY, DINGELL, and 
RYAN. 
As we set about this new era of auto-
motive and vehicular innovation, it is 
crucial that we invest in the workers 
who are the backbone of this uniquely 
American industry. 
This amendment will create a path-
way for the Federal Department of 
Labor and other Federal agencies to 
conduct a study on the automotive 
service technician and vehicle me-
chanic workforce and help promote ap-
prenticeships to meet the increasing 
need of this advanced sector. Already, 
America is short 1 million trained 
workers across our Nation, and we 
haven’t gotten started. We are not off 
the starting line. 
Electric-, 
hydrogen-, 
and 
biofuel- 
powered vehicle technology brings new 
opportunities and new challenges. To 
be ready, we must proactively stand up 
for training and apprenticeship pro-
grams that prepare America’s vehic-
ular workforce for the next generation. 
The motor vehicle industry has long 
served as a gateway to the middle 
class, and this amendment allows the 
Federal Government to take deliberate 
steps to ensure our workers are top of 
mind, not left behind. 
It is vital that we invest in the work-
ers who make, build, and grow America 
and, frankly, power her. I ask that my 
colleagues join me in passing this im-
portant amendment. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of my amendment to 
the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act. 
First, I thank all of our brave vet-
erans for putting their lives on the line 
to defend our freedom and our families. 
After sacrificing so much, no veteran 
should ever have to struggle to get the 
care and resources they have earned. 
We should always have their backs.

May 17, 2022 
My provision today will do just that, 
ensuring that veterans have access to 
high-quality job training, workforce 
development, and career navigation 
services. These skills will help our vet-
erans transition back into civilian life, 
reach their career goals, and care for 
their families. 
We know that veterans have the 
skills to make them exceptional work-
ers, but they often face barriers to em-
ployment. Data shows that unemploy-
ment rates are higher for veterans than 
nonveterans. 
My amendment will ensure that vet-
erans are prioritized to receive Federal 
career resources, and it builds on the 
work I have helped lead, working 
across the aisle since I was elected to 
support our veterans and their fami-
lies. 
The first piece of legislation I passed 
in Congress was to expand hiring of 
post-9/11 veterans. Today, we have the 
opportunity to fight for them like they 
fought for us. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this amendment, and I thank the chair-
man for his leadership. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Today, I rise in support of my amend-
ment to the Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act, which will ensure 
performance measures and account-
ability indicators for recognized post-
secondary credentials are made pub-
licly available. 
Now is the time for us to invest in 
our constituents and the workforce. As 
we do so, I cannot stress enough how 
important it is for Congress to man-
date collecting and publicly reporting 
data on our job training programs. 
That includes publicly reporting on 
performance measures and economic 
outcomes, such as the types of jobs, 
wages, and long-term career progres-
sion. 
Having performance measures and 
accountability 
indicators 
publicly 
available will allow us to direct Fed-
eral resources in an equitable way so 
that we are getting support to individ-
uals and programs that have been his-
torically underfunded. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
my amendment, and I look forward to 
voting for this critical investment in 
our workers for Nevada and for all 
Americans. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I reiterate that this 
is an en bloc amendment containing 
commonsense, 
bipartisan 
proposals 
that strengthen the underlying bill. I 
strongly urge support for both the en 
bloc amendment and the underlying 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, the amendments in 
this en bloc will refocus the workforce 
development system on the individuals 
it was created to serve: jobseekers and 
employers. 
We must make sure that WIOA is 
helping all American jobseekers get 
the skills they need to compete in our 
modern economy. We must also make 
sure that WIOA programs are helping 
employers connect with skilled work-
ers, instead of saddling them with un-
necessary requirements that have no 
proven effectiveness. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my amendment to the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. My 
bipartisan 
amendment 
with 
Congressman 
FLEISCHMANN
authorizes the Secretary of 
Labor and the Secretary of Education to con-
duct a study on the Science, Technology, En-
gineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce 
and STEM education. 
This amendment would provide data on the 
number of STEM jobs currently available and 
anticipated expansion in the field, the number 
of STEM and computer science classes in 
public secondary schools, and policy solutions 
to expand access for individuals with barriers 
to employment, such as those from low in-
come and minority communities, and those 
from rural communities. This data will be help-
ful for us to understand this rapidly expanding 
sector and to ensure the United States is able 
to remain a global leader in the technology in-
dustry. 
This amendment builds off my bipartisan 
bill, H.R. 3602 the Computer Science for All 
Act that Rep. FLEISCHMANN also co-leads with 
me which would create grants to increase ac-
cess to computer science education for preK- 
12 students. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bi-
partisan amendment.

continue improving the Workforce In-
novation and Opportunity Act of 2022. 
This en bloc amendment contains 
proposals that strengthen the under-
lying bill, and I thank my colleagues 
for their contributions. 
I strongly urge support for both the 
en bloc amendment and the underlying 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the amendment. This Democratic en 
bloc creates new programs, authorizes 
new funding, expands bureaucracy on 
workforce development boards, im-
poses new mandates on States and 
local areas, detracts from skills devel-
opment services, and transforms WIOA 
from a workforce program into a wel-
fare program. 
This laundry list of problems is not 
what our Nation’s jobseekers need. I 
cannot agree to saddle employers and 
workers with new Federal mandates 
that will make it harder for them to 
grow the economy and better indi-
vidual lives. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
package, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT 
ROCHESTER), who is a former member 
of the Committee on Education and 
Labor and a strong supporter of work-
force development. 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman SCOTT for 
his leadership. 
I am proud to have my amendments 
to H.R. 7309 before the House today. In 
particular, I am proud of amendment 
No. 3, which gained the support of 42 of 
my colleagues. This amendment would 
establish grants to help break the cycle 
of violence in communities by pro-
viding job and workforce development 
opportunities to youth in communities 
disproportionately affected by gun vio-
lence. 
With this broad support, I call on my 
colleagues to support this amendment, 
which helps reduce community vio-
lence the best way we know how—by 
building 
pipelines 
to 
good-paying, 
high-quality jobs for youth that are 
disconnected 
from 
school 
and 
the 
workforce—to create opportunity, to 
improve lives, and to provide for the 
future. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man, again, for his leadership. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I reiterate that this en bloc amend-
ment contains commonsense proposals 
that will strengthen the underlying 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge sup-
port for both the en bloc amendment 
and the underlying bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, we should focus on 
empowering jobseekers to select skills 
development providers that will pre-
pare them for in-demand jobs and make 
sure that employers are involved in 
this process so we can close the skills 
gap. 
We should also streamline the work-
force system so that funding is not 
wasted on unnecessary bureaucracy 
and 
administrative 
overhead. 
This 
funding should instead be directed to-
ward upskilling workers. 
Unfortunately, this Democratic en 
bloc misses the mark on each of these 
fronts. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this group of amend-
ments, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

KAPTUR). Pursuant to House Resolu-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this en bloc amend-
ment contains several amendments 
which I oppose; therefore, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, Democrats believe that the govern-
ment should control everything: what 
kind of car you drive, whether you 
have to get a vaccine, how or if you get 
to heat or cool your home, if you can 
keep your job, and if you can open or 
operate your business. 
Republicans, on the other hand, be-
lieve that Americans should control 
their own lives, their purchasing deci-
sions, their healthcare decisions, and 
even their businesses and apprentice-
ship programs. 
Businessowners across the country 
try to utilize apprenticeships to de-
velop the skilled employees that they 
need to succeed and grow. Sadly, this 
Democratic bill only funds govern-
ment-approved 
apprenticeships 
that 
are registered with the Department of 
Labor, 
not 
those 
designed 
by 
businessowners who have the audacity 
to think that they know more about

their business than those with no busi-
ness experience, like President Biden 
and 
the 
progressive activists that 
make up his administration. 
b 1530 
Why would anyone trust Joe Biden to 
run their business? He has no private 
sector experience, but he is now the 
proud owner of the worst economic 
record in modern history—so there is 
that. 
Why would anyone trust Democrats 
in this Congress or this administration 
to run their business? These former 
educators, lawyers, community orga-
nizers, and progressive activists have 
ruined the outstanding economy that 
they inherited in January of 2021. 
House Democrats demand that you 
have your apprenticeship program de-
signed by unelected bureaucrats in the 
Department 
of 
Labor 
because, 
of 
course, Washington knows best when it 
comes to everything. 
Look what they have done with infla-
tion, supply chains, rising crime, the 
open border, and everything else. They 
are a picture of success. If Washington 
truly knew best, then one in four busi-
nesses would not have closed perma-
nently in my home State of Virginia 
due to Democrat COVID restrictions. 
Employers in my district often ask 
me: Why do they have to submit to 
government control to be eligible for 
funding for their apprenticeship pro-
gram? Who could do a better job devel-
oping apprenticeships than the people 
who, you know, actually create the 
jobs; despite Washington’s best efforts 
to prevent them from doing so? That 
question was rhetorical, please don’t 
answer. 
My amendment would actually let 
employers run their own apprentice-
ship programs and help them educate 
their workers the way they need to so 
they can expand their workforces. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support my amendment. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
This en bloc includes several amend-
ments that I believe would vastly im-
prove the underlying legislation. 
First, these amendments would bring 
needed flexibility and innovation to 
the 
workforce 
development 
system 
when it comes to apprenticeships. 
Democrats have, unfortunately, chosen 
to double down on the outdated reg-
istered apprenticeship model rather 
than meet employers where they are 
at. This group of amendments includes 
proposals that encourage innovation to 
occur so that apprenticeships can meet 
the needs of more employers. 
Second, 
one 
of 
the 
amendments 
would ensure that States provide a re-
alistic and workable timetable for 
awarding grants and contracts for 
adult basic education. This is simply 
good governance. States should not 
hold on to funding indefinitely that is 
intended to be directed toward job-
seekers. This amendment will make 
sure the funding goes where it is in-
tended and doesn’t get stuck with bu-
reaucrats to the detriment of individ-
uals seeking basic education services. 
Third, WIOA should be focused first 
and foremost on providing skills devel-
opment services for jobseekers. It is 
unfortunate that H.R. 7309 adds vague 
language encouraging supportive serv-
ices to include ‘‘healthcare supports.’’ 
While I was pleased that the long-
standing Hyde amendment was secured 
and will apply to WIOA funds for fiscal 
year 2022 appropriations, I will always 
fight to see the Hyde amendment ap-
plied to ensure Federal funds do not 
support the killing of babies. It is of 
utmost importance that taxpayer dol-
lars do not go to pay for killing babies, 
and this amendment would guarantee 
that. 
The right to life is our most funda-
mental and sacred right and must al-
ways be protected. I will always remain 
vigilant to ensure that taxpayer funds 
do not pay for the killing of babies. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will support this set of amend-
ments, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am the only speaker on this 
side. I am prepared to close, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I have a 
couple of other speakers, so I am not 
prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JACOBS). 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of my amend-
ment, which would be of great benefit 
to adult learners across this country, 
and especially in my home State of 
New York. 
New York State has had issues over 
the last several years in distributing 
these funds promptly. Independent pro-
grams typically operate on very thin 
budgets, so any delay in funding puts 
their operations in jeopardy. 
My amendment would ensure States 
are held accountable for distributing 
funding promptly by requiring the 
States to provide a timeline for distrib-
uting grants and contracts for adult 
basic education in the Unified State 
Plan, and specifying that funds must 
be distributed in a timely manner. 
The typical adult learner benefiting 
from title II funding is either an indi-
vidual who was not able to access a K– 
12 education as a child or is a recent 
immigrant. 
Last September, I visited one of the 
adult education programs in my dis-
trict, Literacy West New York, and I 
walked away very impressed by the 
adult learners there. Life certainly has 
not been easy for them, but that hasn’t 
stopped them from pressing on and 
working to improve their lives. 
It is important we make sure that 
the resources promised to our Nation’s 
adult learners, and the programs that 
support them, are available. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, my amendment puts strong 
protections in place so that no funds in 
this bill can go toward harming the un-
born. 
The underlying bill includes a provi-
sion that allows taxpayer dollars to be 
used for health and mental healthcare 
support. 
Without the protections my amend-
ment offers, this funding could go to 
counseling young pregnant women to 
seek abortions. This is wrong. A child 
in the womb is a distinct, developing, 
whole human being. 
In my home State of Illinois, our 
leftist Governor announced this week 
he will take Federal funding from title 
10 and give it to Planned Parenthood of 
Illinois. This goes directly against Fed-
eral law and the Hyde amendment. 
Those on the other side of this aisle, 
in this body, use every opportunity to 
get rid of the Hyde amendment. That is 
why my amendment is so important. 
The growing hostility toward the Hyde 
amendment is alarming and means we 
must be vigilant in our efforts to en-
sure program dollars authorized by 
Congress cannot be used for abortions 
or abortion services. 
God is the author of life, not Con-
gress. The taking of life through abor-
tion is an assault on the image of God. 
Abortion is not healthcare, despite 
what the left says, and we should not 
force taxpayers to violate their morals 
or strongly held beliefs by forcing them 
to pay for it. My amendment ensures 
that they won’t. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the amendments in 
this en bloc will refocus the workforce 
development system on the individuals 
it was created to serve: jobseekers and 
employers. We must make sure that 
WIOA is helping all American job-
seekers get the skills they need to 
compete in our modern economy. 
We must also make sure that WIOA 
programs are helping employers con-
nect with skilled workers instead of 
saddling them with unnecessary re-
quirements that have no proven effec-
tiveness. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time.

ments on two of the amendments in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

May 17, 2022 
this en bloc that undermine the im-
provements we are putting forward in 
this legislation. 
The first strikes language from the 
bill that prevents nonregistered ap-
prenticeships 
from 
receiving 
WIOA 
funds. If you want to have a nonreg-
istered apprenticeship program you can 
do that, but we ought to fund the reg-
istered programs first since they are 
much better, and we shouldn’t spend 
money on those nonregistered pro-
grams. 
Registered apprenticeship programs 
are a proven strategy that have dem-
onstrated high-quality training and 
wage progression across multiple in-
dustries. This bill supports efforts to 
expand registered apprenticeships to 
additional populations and industries, 
by reserving 50 percent of the funds for 
programs serving individuals with bar-
riers to employment. 
Many of my colleagues have opposed 
the so-called Industry-Recognized Ap-
prenticeship Programs, or IRAPs, be-
cause that program discards key fea-
tures that are the cause of success for 
our registered apprenticeship program, 
including quality standards, worker 
protections, national recognition, and 
the fact that virtually all registered 
apprenticeship graduates end up in jobs 
that pay well above the median wage. 
The second amendment in this en 
bloc amendment group prohibits WIOA 
funds from being used to reimburse any 
healthcare services. I am not sure 
where they find that physical health is 
included. Mental health counseling and 
substance abuse is included as possible 
funding. 
The question about whether WIOA 
will pay for health services is a distrac-
tion from the work we are trying to do 
today, to ensure an equitable recovery, 
and provide opportunity for economic 
advancement for all individuals in all 
communities. 
This legislation reflects the input 
from stakeholders across the country 
who know what it takes to expand ac-
cess to high-quality job training, ca-
reer navigation services, and other 
critical services. 
The statute has long provided for 
flexibility for local programs. The stat-
ute also allows for the provision of sup-
portive services, such as assistance 
with transportation, childcare, depend-
ent care, or housing; services that are 
crucial to facilitating individuals’ abil-
ity to participate in WIOA-funded pro-
grams. 
In fact, the legislation specifically 
ensures that treatment of substance 
use disorder is a permissible use of sup-
portive services under WIOA. 
Fundamentally, needs of individuals 
seeking job training are not always dis-
tinct from health needs. These pro-
grams should meet people where they 
are to facilitate full participation to 
ensure continued and sustained eco-
nomic success. 
Updating and improving programs 
authorized through WIOA, such as the 
bill we are considering today, will lift 
up communities and help us achieve 
that goal. This is what we need to do 
today by voting ‘‘no’’ on this en bloc 
amendment and ‘‘yes’’ on the under-
lying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1119, the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Iowa. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, following the pan-
demic, the Nation’s workforce needs 
have drastically changed, and we need 
a workforce development system that 
helps prepare American workers for the 
job opportunities of today and tomor-
row, not those of the past. 
The Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act is intended to help un-
employed and underemployed workers 
get the necessary skills to succeed in 
America’s modern economy. 
Unfortunately, the majority’s pro-
posed reauthorization lacks the nec-
essary reforms to help America’s work-
ers. 
Our Republican proposal, on the 
other hand, would modernize the pro-
gram to make sure it is employer-driv-
en, which will help America’s economy 
become stronger for decades to come. 
Our plan puts taxpayer dollars to 
work where they need it most: helping 
jobseekers get the skills they need to 
close the skills gap and get back to 
work. 
b 1545 
It does this by bringing more com-
petition into the provider marketplace, 
which expands the pool of skills devel-
opment providers that meet employers’ 
needs and gives more choice to Amer-
ican workers, ensuring States and lo-
calities can use WIOA funds to survey 
employers to get a better under-
standing of the skills that are most in 
demand and respond accordingly. 
Additionally, the Republican pro-
posal adapts WIOA to the changing 
economic landscape. America has just 
come through a pandemic. During that 
time, businesses, employers, and work-
ers shifted to remote work and chang-
ing circumstances. Our skills develop-
ment and education programs should 
adapt to changing circumstances as 
well. Our plan encourages workforce 
boards to provide services virtually, 
which streamlines WIOA and elimi-
nates administrative costs and over-
head. 
Republicans also ensure online skills 
development providers can be included 
in skills development services, expand-
ing the number of providers who can 
address the needs that American work-
ers face. 
The Republican alternative also lev-
els the playing field and encourages in-
novation by ensuring that WIOA does 
not favor registered apprenticeships 
over more innovative apprenticeship 
models that can address the needs of 
more employers. This will keep Amer-
ica’s labor force at the cutting edge of 
global competition. 
Competition drives better results. 
Through pay-for-performance funding, 
our substitute encourages programs 
with a proven track record of success-
fully helping American workers suc-
ceed. Our proposal measures programs 
based on real outcomes and gives 
States and localities more flexibility in 
how they can improve those outcomes. 
We also increase transparency by 
making the process for creating job 
performance metrics available to the 
American public. 
Finally, the Republican plan brings 
greater accountability to the Depart-
ment of Labor’s Job Corps program and 
its Reentry Employment Opportunities 
program. 
Let’s start with Job Corps. Job Corps 
is a popular program, and for many 
students, Job Corps is their last hope. 
There are important reforms we can 
enact to ensure that Job Corps is work-
ing better for students who need it 
most. Our bill would help Job Corps-el-
igible students get technical and career 
education from community colleges, 
which would give this program much- 
needed innovation and better out-
comes. 
The Job Corps program in Ottumwa, 
Iowa, in my district, is a wonderful ex-
ample of how to do exactly this and is 
the right way to perform that program. 
It would also do more to keep Job 
Corps participants safe. Centers would 
be required to report whenever any 
concerning incidents occur, ensuring 
proper oversight of this program. 
We also bring greater accountability 
to the Reentry Employment Opportu-
nities program so we can build on 
President Trump’s historic criminal 
justice reform and use this program to 
help formerly incarcerated Americans 
establish firm economic foundations 
for their new lives. 
These are commonsense reforms that 
will help American employers and job-
seekers. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I claim the time in opposition 
to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia is recognized for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5070 
May 17, 2022 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS) for her great work on this com-
mittee and for bringing forth this 
amendment. It is an excellent amend-
ment, and I support it. 
We need to do everything we can to 
improve the workforce development 
programs in our country. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, we have had an op-
portunity to work together on WIOA, 
but unfortunately, my colleagues in 
the majority are more concerned about 
maintaining the status quo and pla-
cating favored stakeholders. 
What American workers and employ-
ers need is a workforce system that 
prioritizes them over special interests, 
and the Republican alternative would 
do that. 
I urge my colleagues to help us pass 
an alternative proposal that works for 
America, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today to 
modernize and reauthorize the Nation’s 
premier job training program to help 
jobseekers and workers connect with 
well-paying jobs and career pathways. 
Although the substitute offered by 
our colleagues does not meet the ur-
gent needs to strengthen the programs, 
I do want to make it clear that we wel-
come the opportunity to have further 
discussion as the bill heads toward the 
Senate. My goal is to forge common 
ground wherever we can, and I am hop-
ing that this can be the beginning, not 
the end, of the conversation. 
The Republican substitute reauthor-
izes funding for the formula programs, 
regrettably, at roughly the same levels 
as we have today. The status quo is not 
working. As a result, the substitute 
will not provide the level of intensive 
training needed to move people into 
higher wage jobs. 
The average amount the adult for-
mula program spends per participant 
today 
is 
about 
$2,000, 
not 
nearly 
enough to provide quality job training 
to lead to good jobs with competitive 
wages, benefits, and other hallmarks of 
job quality. The Republican substitute 
continues the unacceptable status quo 
with respect to underinvestment in 
training. 
To meet the moment, the underlying 
bill 
also 
codifies 
SECTOR 
grants, 
which are demonstrated to be effective 
in training workers for jobs in high-de-
mand sectors. 
The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
KAPTUR) talked about electric cars. We 
need a lot of training in that area, but 
regrettably, the substitute omits the 
SECTOR grants. 
Our committee meetings held last 
year highlighted bipartisan support for 
reentry programs for justice-involved 
individuals. In response, the bill codi-
fies the program at the Department of 
Labor and commits $250 million for fis-
cal year 2023, more than double the 
amount appropriated this year, and 
provides stable funding amounting to 
$2.3 billion over 6 years. 
With 600,000 individuals released from 
our prisons and jails each year, close to 
half of them experiencing repeat con-
tact with the criminal justice system 
within a year, funding levels in the 
substitute do not come close to meet-
ing the critical needs to invest in serv-
ices to help these individuals obtain 
and retain employment. 
We also reject the requirement of the 
substitute for non-Federal match to re-
ceive a grant. This matching require-
ment is not part of the existing grant 
program 
and 
would 
exclude 
many 
grassroots organizations that are best 
positioned to meet the needs of justice- 
involved individuals in our commu-
nities. 
When we provide subsidies to employ-
ers in the form of on-the-job training 
or customized training, we also need to 
make sure that it is matched by job 
quality. 
The Republican substitute, regret-
tably, leaves too many disconnected 
youth behind. 
To help our youth, whether in school 
or not, gain life skills, the bill invests 
almost $1 billion in fiscal year 2023 for 
summer and year-round youth employ-
ment opportunities. The evidence is 
abundant that these youth employ-
ment opportunities increase lifelong 
earnings and reduce engagement in the 
criminal justice system. 
The Republican substitute also fails 
to meet the moment and address the 
needs of the workers in the 21st cen-
tury, so I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
amendment. 
In 
the 
remaining 
time, 
Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank mem-
bers of my staff on the Committee of 
Education and Labor. They worked 
hard on this legislation, starting with 
Kevin 
McDermott, 
Scott 
Estrada, 
Lorin Obler, Phoebe Ball, Danyelle 
Honore, Jessica Schieder, and former 
staff members Richard Miller and 
Katie McClelland. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1119, the pre-
vious 
question

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5088 
May 17, 2022 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Ohio. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous mate-
rials on H.R. 6531. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 6531, the Tar-
geting Resources to Communities in 
Need Act. H.R. 6531 is a bipartisan bill 
introduced by Majority Whip CLYBURN 
and Representative HAL ROGERS. 
According to the latest decennial 
Census statistics, 37 million people in 
our country live in poverty. H.R. 6531 
takes an important and commonsense 
step to addressing persistent poverty in 
the United States. 
As we know, poverty is a very real 
issue and is experienced by Americans 
of all backgrounds in communities 
across the country. 
The bill before us would provide addi-
tional transparency about places that 
face persistent poverty and would di-
rect increased investments to those 
areas. 
H.R. 6531 would require the Census 
Bureau to publish a list of all areas of 
persistent poverty, and the Office of 
Management and Budget would work 
with agencies to ensure that program 
investments get to the places that need 
them most. 
The bill also fosters accountability 
by requiring annual reports to Con-
gress about qualifying program invest-
ments and their economic impacts. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting our 
fellow Americans through this bipar-
tisan legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6531, directs 
the Office of Management and Budget 
to lead a government-wide effort to re-
view the share of Federal funds ad-
dressing poverty across agencies. Spe-
cifically, OMB must issue guidance to 
Federal agencies to increase the share 
of Federal investments targeting to 
areas of high and persistent poverty. 
Additionally, the bill directs the Cen-
sus Bureau to annually publish a list of 
all persistent poverty areas. The legis-
lation intends to produce a consistent 
listing of areas of persistent poverty 
for agencies to use in determining 
funding allocations. 
The Federal Government currently 
spends an enormous amount of tax-
payer funds on low-income populations. 
You may ask: Exactly how much tax-
payer funds does the Government spend 
on low-income populations? Well, I can 
tell you from being a minority member 
of the House Oversight and Reform 
Committee that I can’t get you that 
answer because the Democrats on the 
Oversight and Reform Committee have 
produced absolutely zero oversight dur-
ing the entire Biden administration. 
Despite the excessive spending on 
that side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, 
we have had basically zero oversight of 
taxpayer funds on the House Oversight 
and Reform Committee. 
b 2100 
That is important that such funding 
decisions appropriately balance the 
needs of rural communities across 
America that have been left behind and 
are experiencing prolonged struggles 
with poverty. 
Again, I want to remind my friends 
across the aisle that those of us on this 
side of the aisle believe that the best 
way to get out of poverty is to create 
an environment where people living in 
poverty have access to good-paying 
jobs. 
But the old model that is the govern-
ment model that continues to be es-
poused by my friends on the other side 
of the aisle is more government pro-
grams to help those who currently re-
side in poverty. 
Madam Speaker, that is a summary 
of the bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, we 
have heard heartfelt discussions today 
about how Federal taxpayer dollars 
should be targeted toward poverty as-
sistance. I am also concerned about 
Federal agencies’ current ability to ad-
minister Federal programs efficiently 
and effectively. 
Under the pandemic, we witnessed an 
unprecedented reliance on telework 
across the Federal Government. This 
reliance on telework has been to the 
detriment of the Nation’s taxpayers 
who rely on Federal agencies. 
These are our constituents who are 
struggling to face out-of-control spend-
ing, inflation, scarcity of goods, and 
other hardships, while Federal workers 
receive perk after perk from Demo-
crats in Congress. 
My House colleagues are all aware of 
the problems their constituents have 
faced getting Federal agencies to proc-
ess the necessary paperwork. There are 
numerous examples of backlogs at 
agencies like Social Security and the 
Internal Revenue Service. 
In my own district, energy producers 
are struggling to get permits to drill 
approved due, in part, to Bureau of 
Land Management field offices only 
having 25 percent of their staff in the 
office at one time. 
Even our veterans have been facing 
trouble accessing records of their serv-
ice to receive the medical care and ben-
efits they are entitled to. 
Let’s be clear: Federal employees not 
being in the workplace has hurt the 
government’s ability to achieve its 
mission. 
House 
Republicans 
have 
fought hard to find out just how much 
expanded telework has hurt agencies’ 
ability to deliver to our constituents, 
and we have tried to get this informa-
tion, but to no avail. 
Recently, the House Oversight Com-
mittee Ranking Member JAMES COMER 
wrote to the administration requesting 
information on Federal workforce re-
turn-to-work policies. Last year, my 
colleague, JODY
HICE, the ranking 
member of the House Oversight and Re-
form Committee’s Government Oper-
ations Subcommittee, led oversight 
letters to the inspectors general of the 
largest agencies, requesting details on 
how telework has impacted agency 
missions. The committee has not re-
ceived adequate responses to our in-
quiries. 
We will offer a solution to this prob-
lem as a motion to recommit. If we 
adopt the motion to recommit, we will 
instruct the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform to consider an amendment 
to require Federal agencies to imme-
diately return to prepandemic levels of 
telework. 
The amendment would also require a 
governmentwide review of pandemic- 
era teleworking policy. 
Finally, it would prevent the admin-
istration from locking in higher levels 
of telework until Congress receives de-
tailed plans on how agency mission 
performance would be impacted. 
These needed reforms will be in-
cluded in my bill, the Show Up Act, 
which I am introducing later this 
week. 
It is time to get the U.S. Government 
back to work for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers. I have pretty 
much summarized the bill in my open-
ing statement, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I urge the passage of H.R. 6531, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to support the Targeting Resources 
to Communities in Need Act of 2022. I thank 
Whip CLYBURN for leading this bill, and I am 
proud to be a cosponsor. I also want to thank 
Chair MALONEY, and the Speaker for moving 
this legislation. 
As chair of the Majority Leader’s Task Force 
on Poverty and Opportunity and an appropri-
ator, I have worked with Whip CLYBURN to up-
lift the 10–20–30 antipoverty formula in legisla-
tion. 
One hundred forty million people in America 
are poor or one healthcare crisis, job loss, or 
emergency away from economic desperation. 
We must prioritize their needs and demands. 
Our poverty crisis is the result of political 
choices. With the Targeting Resources to

Communities in Need Act of 2022, we can 
now choose to take action to increase the 
share of Federal investments targeted to 
areas of high and persistent poverty. 
I urge my colleagues to vote to pass the 
Targeting Resources to Communities in Need 
Act of 2022 to revive our moral and political 
commitments to strengthening pathways out of 
poverty. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.

(B) any costs to the agency during that ex-
pansion attributable to— 
(i) owning, leasing, or maintaining under-

(2) any agency plan to expand telework 
policies, practices, or levels beyond those in

such plan will— 
(A) have a substantial positive effect on— 
(i) the performance of the agency’s mis-
sion, including the performance of customer 
service; 
(ii) increasing the level of dispersal of 
agency personnel throughout the Nation;

worksite; and 
(D) ensure that teleworking employees will 
be provided with secure network capacity, 
communications tools, necessary and secure 
access to appropriate agency data assets and 
Federal records, and equipment sufficient to 
enable each such employee to be fully pro-
ductive, without substantially increasing the 
agency’s overall costs for secure network ca-
pacity, communications tools, and equip-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5090 
May 17, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 2938 which designates the Federal 
building at 111 North Adams Street in 
Tallahassee, Florida, as the Joseph 
Woodrow 
Hatchett 
United 
States 
Courthouse and Federal Building, and 
the United States Postal Service facil-
ity 
located 
at 
120 
4th 
Street 
in 
Petaluma, California, as the Lynn C. 
Woolsey Post Office Building. 
Born during the days of segregation, 
Judge Hatchett grew up in Clearwater, 
Florida. He graduated from Florida 
A&M University in 1954 and was com-
missioned as a second lieutenant in the 
United States Army. He entered How-
ard University School of Law in 1956, 
and when he took the Florida bar exam 
in 1959, Jim Crow regulations pre-
vented him from staying in the hotel 
where the test was being administered. 
After admission to the Florida bar, 
Judge Hatchett entered private prac-
tice in Daytona Beach, practicing 
criminal, civil, administrative, and 
civil rights law in State and Federal 
courts. 
A series of judicial appointments 
that began in 1971 ultimately led to his 
placement on the United States Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals by President 
Jimmy Carter in 1979, making Judge 
Hatchett the first Black man appointed 
to a Federal appeals court in the Deep 
South. Judge Hatchett retired from the 
bench in 1999 and passed away in April 
2021 at the age of 88. 
Former Congresswoman Lynn Wool-
sey brought her unique voice and expe-
rience to the House of Representatives 
when she won her seat in 1993. Earlier 
in her life, a divorce had left her sup-
porting three young children, and she 
worked at low-paying jobs and received 
various forms of public assistance. 
Describing herself as the first former 
welfare mom to serve in Congress, 
Woolsey 
advocated 
for 
expanding 
school breakfast programs; encouraged 
girls to study math, science, and engi-
neering; fought attempts to reduce wel-
fare 
benefits; 
sponsored 
legislation 
that required the Internal Revenue 
Service to help enforce child support 
payments; and secured job-protected 
family leave for family members of in-
jured soldiers. Woolsey retired from 
Congress in 2013 after serving 20 years. 
Madam Speaker, I support S. 2938, 
which recognizes two great Americans: 
Judge Joseph Hatchett and Represent-
ative Lynn Woolsey, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, S. 2938, as amended 
by the Rules Committee, designates 
the Federal building and United States 
Courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida, as 
the Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United 
States Courthouse and Federal Build-
ing, and for other purposes which are 
outside the scope of the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee’s pur-
view. 
Judge Joseph Hatchett served as the 
first African-American justice in the 
Florida 
Supreme 
Court. 
Judge 
Hatchett served for 20 years as a Fed-
eral circuit court judge. He was ap-
pointed by Jimmy Carter to the United 
States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals 
and did that with honor. 
I knew Judge Hatchett. He was a 
good man and a fair judge. He applied 
the law equally. 
This bill was introduced in the Sen-
ate by MARCO RUBIO and RICK SCOTT 
both, and it passed December 29, 2021. 
However, it didn’t meet the suspension 
rules threshold here in the House and 
today comes before us under a rule, and 
that is why we are considering it. 
I reserve the balance of my time, 
Madam Speaker. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR). 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for 
yielding time, and I thank my col-
league and friend from Florida as well. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of S. 2938 to name the Federal 
courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida, for 
Judge Joseph Woodrow Hatchett. It is 
so appropriate for us to honor his life 
and legacy by naming the Federal 
courthouse in Florida’s capital city for 
Judge Hatchett as he was a champion 
for fairness and justice. 
He did have a hardscrabble back-
ground, being born to a maid and a 
fruit picker in the Tampa Bay area. He 
grew up in Pinellas County, but he was 
the pride of his family and his commu-
nity through his graduation from Flor-
ida A&M University and with a law de-
gree 
from 
Howard 
University. 
He 
served in the Army. 
He was one of the first African-Amer-
ican Federal prosecutors—I believe the 
first in the Middle District of Florida. 
He was a Federal magistrate and 
served with distinction. Then he was 
tapped as the first African-American 
supreme court justice in the history of 
the State of Florida, and then on the 
circuit court of appeals, where he then 
served as chief judge. 
Here is how various commentators, 
former clerks, and colleagues describe 
Judge Hatchett: he was unbelievably 
smart, he was a pioneer, a man of ut-
most integrity, a fine and decent judge 
who stood for racial justice and fair-
ness, and a lifetime of work for ethics 
in government and justice in the 
courts. 
One of his colleagues who served with 
him said that his external gentleness 
and calmness was wrapped around a 
steel core of dedication to equality and 
justice. His contribution to both of 
those ideals in Florida and this coun-
try throughout his life are immeas-
urable. 
Madam Speaker, my Republican col-
leagues here who oppose the naming of 
the courthouse for Judge Hatchett now 
have an opportunity to do right by 
him. 
One 
commentator 
described 
the 
changing of votes on the floor of the 
House that day and the votes against 
this honorable man as a new perigee of 
political pettiness, folks who wanted to 
reinforce their image as political heirs 
to this sort of mean-spirited and back-
ward thinking that the South sent to 
Washington in a long-gone era. 
So let’s rise up against this thinking 
of us versus them, this capitulation to 
a MAGA mom. We are better than this 
in this House of Representatives, and it 
is time to honor this outstanding gen-
tleman, 
Judge 
Joseph 
Woodrow 
Hatchett, for his life of integrity, fair-
ness, and honor. He deserves so much 
more. But I hope we can all come to-
gether in a unanimous vote for this 
outstanding American. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN). 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this bill, and I thank my colleagues for 
their kind remarks about our friend 
and my predecessor, former Congress-
woman Lynn Woolsey. 
Lynn was a one-of-a-kind, barrier- 
breaking trailblazer and a lifelong ad-
vocate for women and working fami-
lies. In her 20 years of service in this 
body, she was a passionate voice for 
progressive values, unflinching in her 
convictions and ahead of her time in so 
many ways. Speaker PELOSI
often 
called Lynn the conscience of the Con-
gress. 
People who speak truth to power are 
often met with opposition and mis-
understanding. Clearly, there are some 
Members of this body who don’t share 
Lynn Woolsey’s progressive values, and 
they tried to block efforts to recognize 
her work a few weeks ago. Today, we 
have a chance to right that wrong. 
When this bill was first on the floor, 
my colleagues and I thoroughly cov-
ered Congresswoman Woolsey’s exten-
sive public service career and her many 
personal obstacles that she overcame 
to get to Congress where she became 
one of the leading progressive voices in 
either Chamber. She was co-chair of 
the Congressional Progressive Caucus, 
was chair of the Workforce Protections 
Subcommittee, wrote historic legisla-
tion to expand paid family leave, and 
fought tirelessly to end the wars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Lynn’s work in Congress was all 
about fighting for children and fami-
lies, and nothing made her prouder 
than her own children and family. Any-
one who knows Lynn knows that she 
considers them her greatest achieve-
ment of all: her son Joe Critchett and 
his wife Kim; her son Ed, his wife Lisa 
and their children Teddy and Julia; her 
daughter Amy Critchett, Amy’s hus-
band Mark Pauline and their son Jake 
Eddie; and her son Michael Woolsey, 
his wife Sarah Grossi and their chil-
dren Carlo and Luka. 
My bill had widespread bipartisan 
support, including every Republican

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5091 
May 17, 2022 
Member from California. Let’s move 
past partisan pettiness tonight. I would 
ask my colleagues to please join me in 
honoring 
Congresswoman 
Lynn 
Woolsey’s unique and exemplary career 
in public service by voting ‘‘yes’’ on 
this bill. 
b 2120 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. LAWSON). 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, it is a real honor for me to be 
able to say a few words about Judge 
Hatchett. I heard my good friend and 
person I served with for many years, 
Congressman WEBSTER, say how well 
he knew Judge Hatchett and the honor-
able man that Judge Hatchett was and 
all the things that he did for the State 
of Florida. 
I can tell you, instead of going back 
to what some of the people said, the 
Federal courthouse is about a block 
from my business office that I pass by 
almost every day. When this bill was 
defeated on the House floor, people 
from all over the State of Florida, 
Democrats, Republicans, Independents, 
none of them understood what really 
happened, as much as they loved Judge 
Joseph Hatchett and the things that he 
meant to Florida and to this country; 
not because of his military background 
or because of the way he was treated 
because of Jim Crow and other things, 
but because of his leadership and the 
way that he was fair and the way that 
he loved people and the way that we 
wanted to have judges like Judge 
Hatchett serve on the bench. 
When 
asked 
why 
my 
colleagues 
across the aisle voted against this 
measure, many of them were clueless. 
That should never happen on the floor 
of the House. Or rather they were ill- 
advised, when a 1990s ruling by Judge 
Hatchett began circulating which de-
tailed opposition toward prayer at a 
public high school graduation, when 
Judge Hatchett simply followed the 
precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
It is very bad here in Congress, or 
anyplace, for those of us who have 
served in public office, not only in the 
State, but here in Congress, for some-
one not to tell everybody exactly what 
you are talking about. Many will get 
confused. When I called some of my 
colleagues, they didn’t know what I 
was talking about. It was embarrassing 
to our two Senators, RUBIO and SCOTT. 
It was embarrassing to them, because 
it was passed unanimously out of the 
Senate, to be blindsided because they 
didn’t know what had happened. 
We are talking about an individual 
that gave his career in public service to 
protect people’s rights, to stand for 
those who are less fortunate, a person 
that cared not because of the color of 
an individual but because of the indi-
vidual themself. 
Throughout the State of Florida, 
people constantly call and ask why 
would this happen to such a hero, a 
Florida’s son, one that sacrificed his 
life? I cannot tell you all of the things 
that he had to go through. You have 
heard most of them. But he was an 
honorable man. 
And one great President said: People 
will little note, nor long remember 
what we say here, but they will never 
forget what we did here. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, they will never forget what 
we did here. No one in the State of 
Florida, whether Democrats or Repub-
licans, will ever forget what Judge 
Hatchett did for the State of Florida 
and for this Nation. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I voted for Judge 
Hatchett when the issue was on the 
floor. But it failed. It failed because it 
didn’t have an extraordinary vote. It 
did have a majority vote, but it didn’t 
have an extraordinary vote. I believe 
anything that is dealing with the nam-
ing of a building that will stay forever 
needs an extraordinary set of votes and 
circumstances in order to be qualified. 
I don’t think a majority is enough to 
say we should name something after 
somebody else. That hurts me, but I 
think it is the only thing to do. 
Therefore, because of that, and be-
cause of the process that is here and 
this bill is being combined with an-
other person, those two reasons, I 
would have to oppose this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support S. 2938, 
which recognizes the tremendous con-
tributions of Judge Hatchett and Rep-
resentative Woolsey. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1119, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill, as 
amended. 
The question is on the third reading 
of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be read a 
third time, and was read the third 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on passage of the bill. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings are postponed.

REMEMBERING JODY CASH 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, today, 
I rise with a heavy heart to commemo-
rate the life of the late Jody Cash, a 
Calloway County Sheriff’s deputy and 
former Kentucky State Police officer 
who died in the line of duty yesterday. 
Mr. Cash was a distinguished law en-
forcement officer in west Kentucky. 
His high-level accomplishments and 
rise through the police ranks were a 
testament to his tremendous leader-
ship abilities. But even more impor-
tantly, he truly cared about everyone. 
When the nearby town of Mayfield 
was hit by a devastating tornado last 
December, he made daily visits to the 
scene to help out other first responders 
with whatever they needed. No job was 
too big or too small. 
That was Jody Cash. Even though it 
wasn’t his patrol area, he wanted to 
help. He cared about his friends and his 
neighbors. 
On behalf of Kentucky’s First Con-
gressional District, my condolences are 
with Mr. Cash’s family, and we mourn 
the loss of a brave public servant gone 
far too soon.

b 2130 
CRIME INCREASES AS POLICE 
MORALE DECREASES 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address an issue on the minds 
of many Americans and middle Ten-
nesseans: Rising crime. 
Twelve major cities broke homicide 
records in 2021. The Council on Crimi-
nal Justice says murders nationwide 
went up 5 percent from 2020 and up a 
whopping 44 percent from 2019. Aggra-
vated assaults are up. Robberies are up. 
There has been one decrease under 
President Biden’s watch: a drop in the 
morale among the men and women in 
uniform. 
In fact, the retirement rate for police 
departments across the country has 
jumped by 45 percent since 2019. The 
blame can be squarely placed on the 
left’s antipolice rhetoric, including 
calls to defund the police. 
When the left chooses to demonize 
and demoralize the thin blue line, offi-
cers’ jobs become even tougher, as if 
they are not already tough enough. 
However, I remind them that they have 
our support, and we stand ready to de-
fend and honor them as they protect 
and serve our communities. 
Thank you to all our Nation’s police 
officers.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ON THE 
RISE

May 17, 2022 
came out for the month of April, and it 
is something that ought to be banner 
headlines in all the newspapers. I will 
report them. 
In April, 185,000 illegal immigrants 
entered the United States. Sometimes 
people talk about the number of con-
tacts we have; some of the people 
turned 
around. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
185,000, that is up from 152,000 in 
March. It is 185,000 this April; 66,000 
last April; and two Aprils ago, under a 
different administration, it was under 
6,000. 
Let me repeat: In April 2020, 5,700 
people entered the country, and we 
didn’t know exactly who they were; 
last April, 66,000; now, 185,000. 
In there, we have 8,600 unaccom-
panied children. People want to worry 
about families being broken up, that 
they will send them somewhere in the 
United States. But 8,600 children en-
tered the country unaccompanied. 
In any event, if we have any news-
paper people listening, they ought to 
report this as the banner headline to-
morrow. 
f 
CHAOS AT THE BORDER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, a 
country without borders might as well 
just not be a country. 
The chaos that this current Biden 
border policy is causing is damaging 
American families, American schools, 
and American healthcare, and it is not 
even good for the so-called immigrants 
themselves. 
Witness the way children are used 
and abused in order to get people 
across the border to please the cartels, 
to pay off the cartels. Kids are rented, 
rented out by families. To get a fake 
family group across the border, kids 
are often left by the river—children 
left by the river when they are done 
with them and recycled back across 
like you would an empty pop bottle. 
Is this the kind of humanity this ad-
ministration is about? It certainly 
isn’t for us on this side of the aisle. 
We need to enforce our border. We 
need to continue building the fence so 
it is effective for our border personnel 
to be able to process ones that really 
are coming here on what would be true 
asylum. 
Asylum laws need to be changed be-
cause they have been made a joke. In-
deed, some of the newest cases won’t be 
heard until 2024. There is such a back-
log.

REMEMBERING STAN STRICKLAND 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of the father of the praline and Sa-
vannah’s Candy Kitchen founder, Stan 
Strickland. 
Stan became nothing short of an in-
dustry in the Savannah community 
with the founding of River Street 
Sweets and Savannah’s Candy Kitchen 
40 years ago. 
Savannah’s waterfront is a staple of 
the city. River Street Sweets has been 
a major part of the waterfront for 
many years. 
Stan brought the joy of candy and an 
unforgettable experience to anyone and 
everyone who had the pleasure of vis-
iting his business. Savannah’s Candy 
Kitchen has become a major brand 
across the Southeast, with stores in 
both Atlanta and Nashville as well. 
Stan was also an avid fisherman with 
a deep passion and love for the fish of 
the sea. It was even rumored that he 
had been a fishing partner of the great 
Ernest Hemingway. His competitive 
nature and his love for the sport led to 
his relentless pursuit of every sport 
fish in the ocean. 
This is truly a great loss for the Sa-
vannah community, and I pray that the 
Lord be with Stan’s family and his 
many friends.

FEELING THE IMPACTS IN TEXAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY) is recognized until 10 p.m. as 
the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
HILL), my neighbor. 
WEEK OF PRAYER FOR CHINA 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from Texas for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring 
attention to the continued death of 
freedom and personal rights occurring 
in greater China. 
Last week, Cardinal Joseph Zen, 90 
years old, the former cardinal from 
Hong Kong, was arrested by the Chi-
nese Communist Party in Hong Kong 
for speaking out for democracy. 
This arrest threatens the funda-
mental freedoms of all individuals with 
the courage to speak out against the 
Chinese Communist Party by dem-
onstrating the extent of the regime’s 
aggression, threatening these advo-
cates with life in prison or worse. 
For years, Cardinal Zen has advo-
cated for democracy and religious free-
dom for the Chinese people. I have had 
the opportunity to meet with Cardinal 
Zen and have heard his pleas for free-
dom and advocacy for citizens in Hong 
Kong and Roman Catholics in China. 
Next week, we will recognize a week 
of global prayer for China. During the 
week, we will pray for all suffering 
under the Chinese regime, including 
Cardinal Zen. 
I urge my colleagues to take a mo-
ment to pray for religious tolerance 
and individual rights, to pray for a 
bright and safe future for the Chinese 
people, a future without persecution, a 
future with the fundamental freedoms 
we all deserve. 
We must keep Cardinal Zen and the 
other brave individuals advocating for 
freedoms that we enjoy here today and 
every day in our prayers today, tomor-
row, next week, and until the Chinese 
people are no longer under the boot of 
Communist persecution. 
PRESERVING PEACE AND STABILITY IN TAIWAN 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my legislation that 
I have introduced with the gentleman 
from California (Mr. SHERMAN). 
Our bill, H.R. 7704, the Taiwan Con-
flict Deterrence Act, is a necessary 
step to help deter the Chinese aggres-
sion or the potential aggression, I 
think we should all hope, against Tai-
wan. 
In 1979, Congress passed the Taiwan 
Relations Act to preserve and promote 
a close relationship between the United 
States and Taiwan. For 43 years, the 
United States has been committed to 
the preservation of human rights, 
peace, and stability for the people on 
the island of Taiwan. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
Chinese 
Com-
munist Party has been growing more 
comfortable in taking coercive and ag-
gressive actions toward Taiwan. 
Our bill will ensure that the financial 
consequences for CCP officials and 
their immediate family members are 
immediate if they are tempted to get 
any ideas from their brutal, repressive, 
murderous friends in Russia. 
Under my bill, if the President re-
ports to Congress any threat to the se-
curity or social or economic system of 
Taiwan made by China, as required 
under the 1979 act, the Treasury will 
report on all illicit and corrupt assets 
of senior CCP officials and their imme-
diate family members and will take 
steps to prohibit these officials from 
benefiting from these funds at U.S. fi-
nancial institutions. 
b 2140 
We cannot risk any lack of clarity re-
garding the U.S. commitment to Tai-
wan. Aspiring global strongmen must 
know personal consequences are in 
store for any aggressive behavior. 
Madam Speaker, I urge quick consid-
eration and adoption of our bill, the 
Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Arkansas for his 
comments and for his tireless commit-
ment to pointing out the atrocities in 
China; our needs and interests in mak-
ing sure that we stand with the people 
of Taiwan and stand strong in the 
globe and stand up as a strong country. 
I would note, as we sit here today, 
that we had a number of issues that are 
of paramount importance to the Amer-
ican people. One of which, of course, 
being from the State of Texas, is the 
state of our border. 
Today, official numbers came out 
from Border Patrol that there were 
234,088 encounters in April. Of those, 
some 96,908 were turned away under so- 
called title 42 of our health code. But 
what that means is that at least 137,180 
were released into the United States, 
and perhaps more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5093 
May 17, 2022 
Madam Speaker, 1,300 pounds of 
fentanyl, intercepted. Of course, today, 
Alejandro Mayorkas, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, is down at the Rio 
Grande Valley doing photo ops. Going 
down to the Valley so he can try to 
hide what he said to me and what he 
said to Republicans in the House Com-
mittee on the Judiciary who were ques-
tioning him just two weeks ago. 
We said: Do you have operational 
control of the border? 
And he said, Yes, I do. 
Well, I wonder if my friend from 
Pennsylvania could help explain to the 
American people how 234,000 apprehen-
sions, of which almost 130,000 are being 
turned into the United States, how 
that is somehow operational control. 
The gentleman was an officer in the 
United States military. Does that 
sound like operational control? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my friend, the good gentleman 
from Texas for yielding. 
I think that what most people don’t 
understand—and some even in this 
body—is that when you think about 
operational control of the border, you 
are assuming that the administration 
wants to stop people from illegally 
crossing. You are thinking that they 
are about border security and about 
national security. 
We actually voted in this body, as 
you know, to fund at higher levels, 
Border Patrol, ICE. And many on our 
side of the aisle even voted for it, ei-
ther unwittingly or knowing that this 
administration was actually going to 
use that money, not to stop people 
from coming across the border ille-
gally, not to uphold the law, not to 
stop the invasion that is guaranteed by 
our Constitution to the States, but to 
actually become more efficient at proc-
essing individuals coming across the 
border illegally and moving them very 
quickly into the interior of the coun-
try. 
They used the money so that they 
don’t have the optics of what is hap-
pening at the Del Rio bridge. That is 
why they wanted to be more efficient. 
They don’t want the optics of people 
huddling underneath a bridge, coming 
from some other country or some other 
places illegally, and not having any-
where to go, and the squalor and the 
potential crime element that is associ-
ated with it. 
Since they don’t want that optic, 
what they have done is used the money 
that has been appropriated, the addi-
tional money—not to mention all the 
money that has already been appro-
priated—to move them more efficiently 
into the interior of the country. 
So when the Secretary says he has 
operational control, sure, they are 
operationally controlling the influx of 
illegal aliens, right? That is the actual 
definition, right? That is the word that 
is used—illegal aliens into the country. 
And so on that charge, they are actu-
ally doing very well. 
Unfortunately, the American people, 
and my good friend from Texas, CHIP 
ROY, know they are suffering right now 
under horrific high prices that they 
barely can afford, whether it is for fuel 
in their car, whether it is for being able 
to buy groceries, if you can find them. 
And heaven forbid you are a family 
that has a small child that needs for-
mula. No extra money for that, Mr. 
ROY. No extra money for Americans. 
Mr. ROY. Well, as the gentleman 
knows, as we sit here in the people’s 
House, I just got an update from the 
border showing the Border Patrol is 
building a new soft-sided tent com-
pound in Eagle Pass, Texas. 
Another picture of it shows a big tent 
with chain-link fences up—remember 
the kids in cages?—chain-link fences 
up. And it says it is roughly 215,000 
square feet, which is almost five acres. 
So to the gentleman’s point, why 
would they be doing that? Why would 
Secretary Mayorkas be ordering Border 
Patrol to build a five-acre tent facility 
in Eagle Pass, Texas? 
Mr. PERRY. Well, you know why. 
Mr. ROY. I know exactly why. Could 
it be because they believe their mission 
is to process more aliens coming to the 
United States? That it would encour-
age more to come; have them come 
across the river—never mind being ex-
ploited by the cartels—then get put 
into this facility to be processed and 
released. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, into 
the country but without the view of 
the cameras, without the access of the 
American people in to see what is hap-
pening in their country. That is the 
chain-link fence around it, without the 
view of what is happening in every sin-
gle 
community 
which 
is 
due 
to 
fentanyl overdoses. 
Every single person in America now 
likely can say they know some family, 
somebody in their town that died of a 
fentanyl overdose. So that is coming 
from China, as the good gentleman 
from Arkansas was just talking about 
what is happening in China—it comes 
from China through Mexico across our 
southern border and into your town. 
That is national security. That is 
border security. That is health secu-
rity. And our country and the leader-
ship and this administration is not pro-
viding it at this time. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, the gen-
tleman knows that we are feeling that 
impact in Texas. 
He just mentioned fentanyl. We just 
got the new data from the CDC: 117,000 
dead Americans. 
Yet, nothing but crickets coming 
from our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle. They don’t care. They 
don’t care about 117,000 dead Ameri-
cans, directly as a consequence of Chi-
nese-produced 
fentanyl 
pouring 
in 
through cartels, through Mexico, into 
the United States. Nothing. Crickets. 
Have you seen a bill on the floor of 
this body to deal with that? 
Have you seen any efforts by our 
friends on the other side of the aisle to 
secure the border of the United States 
legitimately or force the hand of Sec-
retary Mayorkas to actually enforce 
the policies of the United States? 
Madam Speaker, very specifically, we 
have a discharge petition at the desk 
with the signature of every Republican 
but not one Democrat willing to go to 
the Democrats leading the administra-
tion and say, We need to secure the 
border of the United States and enforce 
the policies, including title 42 and 
whatever it takes to secure the border. 
Is the gentleman aware of that? 
Mr. PERRY. I am aware of that. 
Madam Speaker, right here on this 
floor, the President came and gave his 
State of the Union and said he wanted 
to secure the border. That is what the 
President said, he wanted to secure the 
border. Yet, the fentanyl keeps coming 
in. The money has been spent. In many 
towns they have defunded the police, 
right? The drugs keep coming in. 
And as there is a primary election 
going on right now in my home State 
in Pennsylvania, many people from 
across the aisle have said they want 
border protection, they want national 
security, 
they 
want 
to 
stop 
the 
fentanyl. 
But given any opportunity to vote in 
favor of that, to come down and sign 
the discharge petition, not one Demo-
crat, not one Democrat signed the dis-
charge petition to force that bill to the 
floor to say keep title 42 in place and 
leave us an opportunity to make sure 
that people and drugs and the crime 
element supported by the cartels don’t 
come to America. Not one will step up. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I would 
ask the gentleman a question. We are 
talking about the extent to which the 
American people are hurting. He talked 
about the baby formula. We are talking 
about the border—wide open borders, 
fentanyl pouring in, American people 
dying. What about the fact that gaso-
line prices are skyrocketing, energy 
prices are going up? 
We know we are producing 55 million 
fewer barrels of oil in February of 2022 
than we did in February of 2020. The 
United States is expected to revert to 
being a net oil importer in 2022 after we 
had become a net oil exporter. 
In the March 2020 debate, President 
Biden said no more drilling on Federal 
lands. No more drilling, including off-
shore; no ability for the oil industry to 
continue to drill, period. 
Yet, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle, they don’t want to talk 
about that because they know full well 
it is precisely the policies of the ad-
ministration to purposely limit the 
ability to produce oil and gas in this 
country that is empowering Putin to 
go after Ukraine and that is damaging 
the price of gas at the pump and harm-
ing the American people. 
Our Democrat colleagues sit silent 
because they worship at the altar of 
the green agenda. Because that is their 
agenda, not the benefit of the Amer-
ican people, not the ability to drive 
your car, go to work, take care of your

family, afford gas, afford the goods and 
services that are going up because the 
diesel prices are going up, the inflation 
is skyrocketing. Because they refuse to 
open up American oil and gas, which 
we sit on a bevy of. 
It is enormously important for our 
national security and the national se-
curity of our friends around the world. 
I know the gentleman, being from 
Pennsylvania, is well aware of the ab-
surd energy policies that are harming 
the American people because they wor-
ship at the altar of the Green New Deal 
and the green agenda. 
Mr. PERRY. That is exactly right. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple see and are feeling it every single 
day when they go to the gas pumps, 
when they have got to get their kids to 
soccer games and multiple activities, 
driving back and forth, and they can’t 
afford to fill up their gas tanks any-
more. 
This is because we are at the begin-
ning of implementing the Green New 
Deal, forcing it on Americans; not let-
ting you make the choice, but letting 
policymakers in Washington, D.C., de-
termine how your life is going to be. 
And while the President says, in this 
very body, they want to have a vote on 
price-gouging. Meanwhile, we are not 
allowing the people to produce the gas 
and oil that we desperately need to 
keep our energy economy going. Our 
country runs on energy, right? The 
President is saying no more leases. Not 
one pipeline is being built. 
b 2150 
No more leases. No more refining. It 
is not happening. They actually said 
that we are producing more gas and oil 
than ever before in history. But you 
just gave them the numbers, Mr. ROY. 
You just gave us the numbers. It is ac-
tually less. That is what happens, and 
you are going to pay more. For every 
single gallon that you buy, you are 
going to pay more. And this is all by 
design. They don’t want you to have 
the choice. They actually want to force 
you to drive an electric vehicle. 
As long as we are talking about en-
ergy and the lack thereof, Mr. ROY, it 
was just reported in your State to be 
prepared for blackouts and brownouts 
because there is going to be a lack of 
electricity production. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the 21st 
century. 
America 
knows 
how 
to 
produce energy. We know how to make 
electricity. We know how to transport 
it. Yet, it is happening in California, 
and now it is going to start cascading 
across the country because of the pol-
icy decisions of the Green New Deal 
and those who worship at the altar of 
this green agenda that forces us to 
take these things that we can’t afford 
and are inefficient and ineffective. 
Mr. ROY. Absolutely. It is this green 
agenda that has us bowing down to 
China in order to get the minerals and 
resources in order to make solar panels 
and wind farms. If you look at Texas 
that produces as much wind as any 
State in the country, Texas only had 17 
percent wind production from its wind 
farms last week, which was a big chunk 
of the problem that we had in terms of 
energy production. 
Our grid is over-reliant on wind and 
solar. When you have a windless cloudy 
day, what do you need? You need fossil 
fuels. What else do you need? Nuclear 
power. Do you know how much nuclear 
power or fossil fuel generation we have 
in the pipeline, so to speak, right now 
across this country or even in Texas? 
Minuscule. Because of the worshipping 
at this ridiculous agenda. 
Do you know how many coal-fired 
plants they have in China? Something 
like 1,100. 
Mr. PERRY. And opening one a week. 
Mr. ROY. And opening one a week. 
Do you know how many coal-fired 
plants we are opening in this country? 
Zippo. 
Do you know what kind of rules we 
have coming out right now to hammer 
the coal industry in Texas and else-
where? Massive rules. 
Do you know what that means for 
the American people? No energy, lower 
energy, higher costs. That is 100 per-
cent true and provable. 
Yet, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle walk around in some daze 
saying, oh, we are going to get this 
magic unicorn energy from wind and 
solar on a windless, cloudy day. It is 
absolutely absurd. 
The American people are suffering. 
The American people are suffering be-
cause of the Democratic policies that 
are causing harm to them, driving up 
prices, making it impossible for them 
to have a reliable grid, reliable energy. 
We are sitting on a mountain of it in 
this country. We are exporting liquified 
natural gas from this country. CO2 is 
going down. We are not relying on 
China. We are sticking it back on 
them, and our people are benefiting 
and prospering. 
The Democrat agenda is: stop that. 
Go beg China. And then pay more for 
your goods and services. Then what 
does Joe Biden say? What does Jen 
Psaki say in all of her infinite wisdom 
heading off to MSNBC after she accuses 
our Border Patrol agents of whipping 
people? She says: ‘‘Oh, buy a Tesla.’’ 
Go spend $60,000 and go buy an electric 
car. 
Do you know what? If you are in Aus-
tin, Texas, and you want to drive to 
Midland, I guess you have to stop 
somewhere in the middle and hope you 
can charge. 
Mr. PERRY. And hope you can 
charge. And I sure hope you have the 
time to sit there and charge, right? It 
is not like filling it up at the gas sta-
tion and you get back on the road and 
keep going and make it in a reasonable 
amount of time. 
The gentleman from Texas is abso-
lutely right. I mean, he talked about 
the fact that we are empowering China. 
Eighty-five percent of the critical min-
erals that come here to make the solar 
panels and windmills come from China. 
Now, of course, we subsidize all that. 
That subsidy means it is coming from 
your tax dollars. 
Of course, I don’t know whether you 
know this or not, Mr. ROY, but I sus-
pect you do, those tax dollars going to 
pay for those raw materials in China 
are then—those tax dollars go to mine 
it, to mine it in the Congo, right? 
Mr. ROY. Yes. 
Mr. PERRY. One of the biggest mines 
in the world, the biggest mine in the 
world. Slave labor, child slave labor, 
right? We are talking about saving the 
rainforest, meanwhile they are cutting 
all this stuff down to mine these min-
erals, so we can feel good. So we can 
feel good about our ourselves and 
America. Meanwhile, it is supporting 
child slave labor with your taxes, sup-
porting deforestation of the rainforest. 
For what? For higher prices and less 
availability, and it is just going to 
keep coming, ladies and gentlemen, as 
long as the agenda of the left keeps 
being implemented. 
Mr. ROY. You know what I have here 
in front of me? I have a photograph 
that a friend—I think he is one of the 
six people watching on C–SPAN right 
now—just texted me and said, Here is a 
picture of gasoline at the pump. Diesel 
I should say, not gasoline. Diesel, 194 
gallons. Do you know what the bill 
was? $1,090. 
You want to know what is coming, 
American people, this summer? Have 
you looked at the inventory numbers 
for diesel? Ladies and gentlemen, it is 
coming. All of those goods and services 
sitting in trucks, trucks that are hav-
ing to pay $1,090 to fill their tank, that 
is getting passed on to you. You are 
going to pay for that. You, the Amer-
ican people, are going to pay for that 
while Democrats in this body, in the 
Senate, and in this administration 
wave it off, laugh it off, and say: ‘‘Go 
buy a Tesla.’’ 
Well, that isn’t going to make your 
prices any cheaper. That isn’t going to 
enable you to be able to afford the 
goods and services you need. 
I know we have only got a few min-
utes left, so I want to ask one more 
thing of my friend from Pennsylvania. 
We are talking here about energy, and 
we know how much energy is at the 
central debate about what is going on 
between Russia and Ukraine. And we 
know the administration didn’t do a 
darn thing leading up to what is hap-
pening in Ukraine to cut off Nord 
Stream 2 to open up American oil and 
gas to try to cut off what we knew was 
coming and what Putin was doing. 
Yet, last week we had a vote on the 
floor of this body on a $40 billion un-
paid for blank check in the name of 
standing with Ukraine. Only 57 Mem-
bers of this body out of 435 possible 
Members—however 
many 
are 
here 
right now—57 dared to say, Hey, wait a 
minute, maybe we should actually de-
bate $40 billion that is not paid for that 
is going to go into the State Depart-
ment, go into the Department of De-
fense, going around the world, paying

for refugee resettlement, paying for 
food around the world, paying for con-
tinued support of military operations 
in Ukraine. 
I 
know 
the 
gentleman 
supports 
Ukraine and Zelenskyy, and I know the 
gentleman opposes Putin, but did you 
have a problem with a $40 billion blank 
check? 
Mr. PERRY. I had a problem with $40 
billion with 5 hours, 5 hours of consid-
eration for $40 billion. When we took 
the text to the staff and asked them 
about this line, what is this $300 mil-
lion, and they said, Well, we don’t 
know. And we are expected to vote on 
that. We are expected to vote for that 
or somehow we are aligned with Vladi-
mir Putin. 
Keep in mind, my good friend from 
Texas, 2 weeks prior to this we did this 
lend-lease without any time limit, 
without any funding limit, then come 
back, and the President asked for $33 
billion, we give him $40 billion. We 
can’t afford our diesel. Pretty soon you 
are not going to be able to afford your 
food. We won’t do anything on our own 
border. Prices are going up for every 
single person. 
Every 
American 
wants 
to 
help 
Ukraine, but we are Americans, and 
the Representatives in this body rep-
resent America. 
Mr. ROY. I agree with the gentleman. 
I support Ukrainians, but I represent 
Americans, and Americans want to 
stand alongside Zelenskyy and push 
back on Putin, but they want us to do 
our job responsibly. 
When I hear the majority leader of 
the other party say, ‘‘a time of war.’’ 
When I sat with the majority leader in 
a Rules Committee meeting upstairs, 
and he said: ‘‘We are at war,’’ I was 
wondering when we voted to go to war. 
If we are going to have a proxy war, 
and we are going to give $40 billion to 
Ukraine because we want to look all 
fancy with our blue and yellow ribbons 
and feel good about ourselves, maybe 
we should actually have a debate in 
this Chamber, a debate in this body be-
cause the American people expect us to 
do that. 
When the border of this country is 
wide open, and cartels have control of 
it, and fentanyl is pouring in, and we 
have $30.5 trillion in debt, and gas 
prices are spiking, and it cost $1,100 to 
fill a tank of diesel, and we go, Oh, 
blank check, $40 billion. By the way, I 
am looking at my colleagues on this 
side of the aisle on that same point. 
The American people deserve and ex-
pect better than that. I yield to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. You are absolutely 
right, Mr. ROY. The American people at 
least deserve the debate. Five hours, 
ladies and gentlemen, 5 hours for $40 
billion. People around here complain 
about all kinds of things. 
Mr. ROY. Heaven forbid we vote on 
bills put before this body. 
Mr. PERRY. Right. That is a prob-
lem. But $40 billion, no problem. 
Meanwhile, our citizens, the citizens 
that I represent, they are having a hard 
time figuring out, do they pay their in-
surance, do they pay their mortgage? I 
talk to people on a regular basis that 
say they put their bills on their table, 
and they put a date on them when they 
are due and when they think they will 
be able to pay for them. They say, I 
have never had to do that before. I am 
selling stuff to pay my bills because I 
can’t afford what is happening in my 
country right now. Meanwhile, we 
can’t talk for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 
an hour about $40 billion to some other 
country. Meanwhile, we just gave a 
blank check 2 weeks before to let the 
President spend any amount of money 
for any amount of time on the same 
country. We didn’t declare war. 
Mr. ROY. I know the gentleman is 
correct. I know we are just about out of 
time. 
I would just say in closing, the Amer-
ican people expect us to do our job. The 
American people expect us to vote, the 
American people expect us to stand up 
for them, and that is what we are 
happy to be here doing. I appreciate 
the gentleman joining me tonight. 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for al-
lowing me to be part of this Special 
Order and speak on behalf of and fight 
on behalf of the American people that 
are struggling right now. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You are our shelter 
from the storm. Lord, thank You that 
though wrong seems so strong, You 
continue to rule. 
Lord, we pray for grieving families 
who have become the collateral dam-
age of domestic terrorism. We pray for 
sons and daughters, for fathers and 
mothers, for sisters and brothers who 
have had their lives maimed by the in-
comprehensible. 
Lord, use our lawmakers as sowers of 
reconciliation. Where there is hatred, 
may they sow seeds of love. Where 
there is despair, may they sow seeds of 
hope. Where there is falsehood, may 
they sow seeds of truth. Lord, permit 
this planting to produce the harvest of 
a more perfect Union for this land we 
love. 
God bless America. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday, in a bipartisan landslide, 
the Senate advanced legislation to get 
more arms and assistance to the inno-
cent people of Ukraine. 
Senators 
COLLINS, 
CORNYN, 
BAR-
RASSO, and I just returned last night 
from Europe. Our first stop was Kyiv. 
It was moving to feel some of the im-
pacts of Putin’s aggression, to see a 
free and independent nation made to 
literally fight for its life. But it was 
also inspiring to witness the bravery 
and 
the 
determination 
that 
have 
united Ukrainians in the face of this 
onslaught. 
Ukraine has had more than its share 
of domestic political differences in re-
cent years. Putin must have thought 
some 
Ukrainians 
would 
welcome— 
would 
actually 
welcome—invading 
Russian forces. Instead, both Ukrain-
ian-speaking 
and 
Russian-speaking 
Ukrainians have united in defense of 
their sovereign nation. Some predicted 
Ukraine would fold in a few days and 
Russia would stroll right to Kyiv. That 
was wrong too. Ukraine is tough, and 
Kyiv remains in Ukrainian hands, with 
life moving back toward normalcy de-
spite the continued threat. 
Our delegation was honored to meet 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy. 
He 
ex-
pressed his gratitude to the United 
States for our leadership and support 
on a bipartisan basis, as well as for 
other countries that have stood by his 
people in their time of need. America is 
not the only free country that has 
Ukraine’s back. President Zelenskyy 
was moved by certain European coun-
tries who have given Ukraine, in his 
words, literally ‘‘everything they had.’’ 
Of course, other European countries 
can and should do more to help 
Ukraine. 
And 
the 
administration 
should lead an effort to ensure broad, 
sustained international support for 
Ukraine. 
America’s support for Ukraine has 
highlighted the limits to our stockpiles 
of certain munitions and shortcomings 
in our own defense production capac-
ity. A number of European countries 
have dipped even deeper into their 
weapons inventories. They will need a 
refill as well. 
As our European friends wake up 
from their ‘‘holiday from history’’ and 
increase defense spending, I hope the 
United States will be a reliable sup-
plier of advanced weaponry to our 
NATO allies, a textbook win-win. 
Our delegation reiterated to Presi-
dent Zelenskyy the bipartisan con-
sensus which the Senate demonstrated 
with last night’s vote. The United 
States of America has Ukraine’s back 
and will stand with our friends until 
they win. 
Ukraine is not asking anybody to 
fight their fight for them. They are 
only asking for help in getting the re-
sources and tools they need to defend 
themselves. And we and our friends and 
partners across the free world will 
stand 
behind 
Ukraine 
until 
they 
achieve victory as they define it. The 
outcome of this fight has major rami-
fications for the West, and the Ukrain-
ians should not be left to stand all 
alone. 
As an overwhelming bipartisan ma-
jority of the Senate reaffirmed yester-
day, America’s decision to support 
Ukraine is not some frivolous act of

charity. It serves our own national se-
curity and strategic interests for inter-
national borders to continue to actu-
ally mean something. It serves our own 
security and interest to impose mas-
sive costs on Putin’s long-running cam-
paign of violent imperialism. And it di-
rectly and powerfully serves our na-
tional interest to deter potential fu-
ture wars of aggression before they 
start. 
So, Madam President, I assure you 
that President Xi and the CCP are 
watching Ukraine carefully. There is a 
concrete reason why democratic Asian 
countries like Japan and Taiwan are 
rooting hard for Ukraine to prevail. 
Moreover, if we are stuck in a long- 
term strategic competition with China, 
we will want a stable, secure, and 
strong Europe on our side. 
Speaking of America’s national in-
terest, our delegation also visited what 
we hope and expect will soon be the 
two newest members of the NATO alli-
ance. We arrived in Stockholm and 
Helsinki just as the leaders of Sweden 
and Finland announced their nations 
will seek to join the alliance that has 
secured peace in Europe for more than 
73 years. 
It was an honor to have robust dis-
cussions 
with 
Prime 
Minister 
Andersson, Defense Minister Hultqvist, 
and 
key 
parliamentary 
leaders 
in 
Stockholm; and President Niinisto, 
Prime Minister Marin, Defense Min-
ister Kaikkonen, and parliamentary 
leaders in Helsinki. I gave them my as-
surance as Senate Republican leader 
that I fully support both Finland’s and 
Sweden’s accession. I will do all I can 
to speed treaty ratification through 
the Senate. 
Finland and Sweden are impressive 
and capable countries, with military 
capabilities that surpass many of our 
existing NATO allies. As new members, 
they would more than pull their 
weight. 
These two nations’ geographic loca-
tions are strategic. They have well- 
equipped 
and 
professional 
armed 
forces. Their military and high-tech in-
dustrial bases are robust. There is al-
ready significant interoperability that 
connects their defenses and NATO’s. I 
will have more to say on this subject in 
the days and weeks ahead. Finland and 
Sweden 
would 
make 
NATO 
even 
stronger than it stands today. 
Finally, it must be noted that our 
delegation was not the most important 
group of Americans shipping out to 
stand with our friends in Europe—not 
by a longshot. There are 100,000 Amer-
ican soldiers currently stationed in Eu-
rope to bolster the peace and shore up 
NATO. This includes the Kentucky- 
based V Corps. 
And we received word just last week 
that 4,700 members of the 101st Air-
borne from Kentucky’s Fort Campbell 
will also travel to Europe in the com-
ing months. The Screaming Eagles 
have a long history of defending Amer-
ica’s national security interests in Eu-
rope. I am proud of these brave men 
and women for being ready to deploy at 
a moment’s notice. I am proud America 
can make this peaceful contribution to 
our allies’ sovereignty and strength in 
Europe, and I am proud of the entire 
Fort Campbell community for keeping 
these men and women well-prepared for 
this mission. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on another matter, by early 2020, 
before the pandemic, Republican poli-
cies had helped create one of the best 
economic moments for working Ameri-
cans literally in our lifetimes. Unem-
ployment was low, inflation was low, 
and real take-home pay was rising 
steadily. In fact, we had wages rising 
faster for the bottom 25 percent of the 
wage scale than for the top 25 percent. 
The incoming all-Democratic govern-
ment was handed a reopening economy 
and a million vaccines going into arms 
per day. The country was packed with 
optimism and primed for a comeback. 
But 
through 
their 
far-left 
policy 
choices, Washington Democrats have 
driven our economy right into the 
ground. Inflation is setting 40-year 
records in consecutive months; gas and 
diesel prices have set new all-time 
highs on consecutive days; and sticker 
shock continues to cause headaches for 
Americans buying household essen-
tials. 
One college student in California said 
that buying groceries has him ‘‘taking 
extra loans to pay for my expenses. I’m 
maxing out my credit cards.’’ A woman 
in Virginia reports she has taken to 
visiting three different food stores in 
one trip to make sure she is getting the 
best prices on everything she needs. A 
warehouse worker in New Jersey says 
she and her husband are spending more 
time hunting for coupons. 
It’s not a lot, but I’m trying to buy 
healthy things that also fill us up. 
Overall grocery prices have jumped 10 
percent in the past year, just one part 
of why many Americans say the Biden 
economy is not working for them. 
Fewer than one in four American con-
sumers say the current economic con-
ditions are even somewhat good, and 
fewer than one in five say the Biden ad-
ministration’s policies have done any-
thing to help. 
Democrats made runaway reckless 
spending their new normal here in 
Washington. So historic, painful infla-
tion has become the new normal for 
working families everywhere else.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of a motion to pro-
ceed to H.R. 7691, which the clerk will 
report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 368, H.R. 
7691, a bill making emergency supplemental 
appropriations for assistance for the situa-
tion in Ukraine for the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 2022, and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
H.R. 7691 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, today 
the Senate is considering a bill to give 
$40 billion to Ukraine. This bill brings 
up the questions of both constitu-
tionality and also affordability. 
There was an essay written in 1867 
that was published in Harper’s Maga-
zine. It was called ‘‘Not Yours To 
Give.’’ It is the story of Davy Crockett 
as a Congressman in the late 1820s. 
Like most stories of that vintage, some 
will argue that the story is an accurate 
rendition while others may say it is 
apocryphal. The moral of the story, 
however, is incontestable. 
Davy Crockett only served two terms 
in Congress, but on one day in Congress 
he was confronted with a bill to give 
money to the widow of a military offi-
cer. Davy Crockett arose and gave this 
speech. 
Mr. Speaker—I have as much respect for 
the memory of the deceased, and as much 
sympathy for the sufferings of the living, if 
suffering there be, as any man in this House, 
but we must not permit our respect for the 
dead or our sympathy for a part of the living 
to lead us into an act of injustice to the bal-
ance of the living. 
We have the right, as individuals, to give 
away as much of our own money as we please 
in charity; but as members of Congress we 
have no right so to appropriate a dollar of 
the public money. 
Davy Crockett continued: 
I am the poorest man on this floor. I can-
not vote for this bill, but I will give one 
week’s pay— 
I will give my check for 1 week, and if 
every member of Congress were to do this, it 
will amount to more than this bill asks for. 
When Crockett finished, there was si-
lence, and, remarkably, the bill failed. 
When later asked for an explanation, 
Davy Crockett explained. 
He said: 
Several years ago I was one evening stand-
ing on the steps of the Capitol with some 
other members of Congress, when [we saw] a 
great light over in Georgetown. It was evi-
dently a large fire. We jumped into a hack 
and drove over as fast as we could. In spite 
of all that could be done, many houses were 
burned and many families made homeless, 
and, besides, some of them had lost all but 
the clothes they had on. The weather was 
very cold, and when I saw so many women 
and children suffering, I felt that something

ought to be done for them. The next morning 
a bill was introduced appropriating $20,000 
for their relief. We put aside all other busi-
ness and rushed it through as soon as it 
could be done. 
Later in the year, when Davy Crock-
ett was back in Tennessee, he ran into 
a constituent by the name of Horacio 
Bunce. Crockett asked him for his 
vote, and Horacio Bunce responded 
thusly. He said: 
You had better not waste your time or 
mine. I shall not vote for you again. 
Your vote last winter shows that either 
you have not the capacity to understand the 
Constitution or that you are wanting in the 
honesty and firmness to be guided by it be-
cause the Constitution, to be worth any-
thing, must be held sacred and rigidly ob-
served in all its provisions. The man who 
wields power and misinterprets the Constitu-
tion is more dangerous the more honest he 
is. 
Horacio Bunce continued. He said: 
No, Colonel, there’s no mistake. 
The newspapers say that last winter you 
voted for this bill to give $20,000 to some who 
suffered from a fire in Georgetown. Is that 
true? 
Congressman Crockett answered him: 
Well, my friend; I may as well own up. You 
have got me there. But certainly nobody will 
complain that a great and rich country like 
ours should give the insignificant sum of 
$20,000 to relieve its suffering women and 
children. 
Horacio Bunce replied to Congress-
man Crockett. He said: 
The power of collecting and disbursing 
money at pleasure is the most dangerous 
power that can be intrusted to man. . . . 
[W]hile you are contributing to relieve one, 
you are drawing it from thousands who are 
even worse off than he. If you had the right 
to give anything, the amount was simply a 
matter of discretion with you, and you had 
as much right to give $20,000,000 as $20,000. If 
you have the right to give to one, you have 
the right to give to all; and, as the Constitu-
tion neither defines charity nor stipulates 
the amount, you are at liberty to give to any 
and everything which you may believe, or 
profess to believe, is a charity, and to any 
amount you may think proper. 
No, Colonel [Crockett], Congress has no 
right to give charity. Individual members 
may give as much of their own money as 
they please, but they have no right to touch 
a dollar of the public money for that pur-
pose. If twice as many houses had been 
burned in this county [in Tennessee] as in 
Georgetown, neither you nor any other mem-
ber of Congress would have thought of appro-
priating a dollar for our relief. 
Bunce informed Crockett that if each 
Congressman had shown their sym-
pathy for the fire victims by giving 1 
week’s pay, it would have nearly cov-
ered the cost, but it was easier simply 
to give other people’s money. 
Bunce continued: 
The people about Washington, no doubt, 
applauded you for relieving them from the 
necessity of giving by giving what was not 
yours to give. The people have delegated to 
Congress, by the Constitution, the power to 
do certain things. To do these, it is author-
ized to collect and pay moneys, and for noth-
ing else. Everything beyond this is usurpa-
tion, and a violation of the Constitution. 
‘‘So you see, Colonel, you have violated the 
Constitution in what I consider a vital point. 
It is a precedent fraught with danger to the 
country, for when Congress once begins to 
stretch its power beyond the limits of the 
Constitution, there is no limit to it, and no 
security for the people.’’ 
Today, we are faced with a vastly 
greater sum of money than $20,000. We 
are faced with $40 billion to be gifted to 
Ukraine—a noble cause, no doubt; a 
cause for which I have great sympathy 
and support but a cause for which the 
Constitution does not sanction or ap-
prove of. 
Now, we could ask, as Davy Crockett 
did, if each Member of the Senate 
would like to contribute individually 
to Ukraine, but, of course, that would 
simply serve to demonstrate the enor-
mity of the gift. To come up with $40 
billion, each Senator would need to 
give $400 million—not a likely sce-
nario. It is much easier to spend such 
exorbitant amounts if you are spending 
someone else’s money. 
But even if the Senators won’t agree 
to contribute their own money, surely 
we are a rich country and can afford it. 
Well, not exactly. The U.S. debt now 
approaches $30 trillion. In the past 2 
years alone, we have added nearly $6 
trillion in new debt. Inflation roars 
throughout the land. Grocery bills are 
punishing the working class and poor, 
and gas prices exceed $5. Even before 
the pandemic bailouts, our country was 
running a trillion-dollar annual deficit 
just to pay for its routine commit-
ments. 
Putting aside the constitutionality 
of the $40 billion to Ukraine, isn’t there 
a more fiscally responsible way this 
could be done? What about taking the 
$40 billion from elsewhere in the budg-
et? 
The United States spends more on 
our military than the next eight coun-
tries combined. Couldn’t Congress sim-
ply shift over the $40 billion and not 
add to the debt? If the defense of 
Ukraine is really in our national secu-
rity interests, shouldn’t the gift come 
from our military budget? 
What about cutting wasteful spend-
ing? My office catalogued over $50 bil-
lion in waste. I don’t know about you, 
but couldn’t we cut programs like the 
million-dollar study to see if taking 
selfies of yourself while smiling and 
then looking at these selfies later on— 
if that makes you feel good? Couldn’t 
we cut the budget of the National 
Science Foundation that spends bil-
lions of dollars studying such burning 
questions as ‘‘Do Panamanian city 
frogs have a different mating call than 
country frogs?’’ Couldn’t we maybe cut 
the $2 million the NIH spent studying 
cafeterias to see, if someone in front of 
you sneezes on the food, whether you 
are more or less likely to eat that 
food? Couldn’t we maybe cut the 
money spent on Japanese quail, study-
ing whether or not they are more sexu-
ally promiscuous or not when you give 
them cocaine? 
If we are not willing to cut the budg-
et at all, couldn’t we ask the American 
people to step up and pay a war tax? If 
this is really for our national security, 
it should be very popular with the peo-
ple. Why don’t we offer to tax them in 
exchange for this? 
Guess what. The American people 
don’t want to cut spending anywhere in 
the budget—at least their representa-
tives don’t. They don’t want to pay any 
taxes for this. They just say ‘‘Put it on 
my tab.’’ But we have been doing that 
for decades, and that is why we have a 
$30 trillion debt, and that is why we 
have roaring inflation. 
If you want to pay for this with a 
tax, you could triple the gas tax. I am 
guessing that is going to be really pop-
ular and people really want to send 
this money so badly that they would be 
willing to triple the gas tax. If we were 
honest, that is what the people who are 
for this would propose. That would 
guarantee $5 gas for the foreseeable fu-
ture. 
Alternatively, Congress could raise 
the income tax about $500 for every 
American taxpayer. I am sure that 
would be popular. And for the people 
who think it is a great idea to send $40 
billion overseas, why don’t they just be 
honest with people and tax them? Here 
is your bill, Mr. and Mrs. America, $500 
a taxpayer. Then it would be paid for. 
No, it is like everything else: Put it on 
our tab. Well, Uncle Sam’s tab is full. 
It is complete. 
To be clear, I am not for raising 
taxes to finance Ukraine’s defense, but 
it is irresponsible to simply borrow 
more money. To borrow the money 
from China simply to send it to 
Ukraine makes no sense and makes us 
weaker, not stronger. 
But let’s be honest—most of Congress 
doesn’t seem to care about the debt, 
doesn’t seem to care how much money 
we shovel out the door and out of the 
country. Why? Because it is not their 
money. Every day, Milton Friedman’s 
statement has proven correct—that no-
body spends somebody else’s money as 
wisely as their own. 
I doubt the big spenders in Congress 
will ever consider spending any of their 
own money. But Americans across the 
land should sit up and notice and at-
tach blame to these profligate spend-
ers. 
In the past 3 months, bipartisan ma-
jorities, Republicans and Democrats, 
have added over $100 billion to the 
debt. Now these same big spenders are 
proposing another $50 billion next week 
to bail out restaurants—restaurants 
that have been primarily injured by 
overzealous Democratic Governors and 
their edicts. 
There 
are 
ramifications 
to 
this 
mountain of debt. Make no mistake, 
inflation is here, and it is rip-roaring 
and on the rise. Just as aiding the vic-
tims of fire in Georgetown during the 
days of Davy Crockett ignored the mis-
fortune of the suffering people in lands 
too distant from Washington to be no-
ticed, so, too, does today’s deficit 
spending to be sent overseas ignore the 
pain and suffering and the inflation 
that is caused by that debt on everyday 
American families.

S2528 
May 17, 2022 
Inflation is simply an increase in the 
money supply. It comes from the Fed-
eral Reserve buying U.S. debt. M2 is a 
measure of the money supply. For the 
last 3 years, it has been going up at 
about 
a 
15-percent 
rate. 
So 
we 
shouldn’t really be surprised that there 
is inflation because inflation is an in-
crease in the money supply. In January 
of last year, the annualized rate of the 
M2 expansion, the monetary expansion, 
was 27 percent. 
No one should be shocked we have in-
flation. We have rising prices in the 
grocery store. We have rising prices at 
the pump because we borrowed too 
much money. We went heavily in debt, 
and the Federal Reserve is buying the 
debt. All this so-called free money 
floods the market and chases prices 
higher. Adding to our debt will only 
make the problem worse. 
Yes, our national security is threat-
ened—not by Russia’s war on Ukraine 
but by Congress’s war on the American 
taxpayer. The vast majority of Ameri-
cans sympathize with Ukraine and 
want them to repel the Russian invad-
ers. But if Congress were honest, they 
would take the money from elsewhere 
in the budget or ask Americans to pay 
higher taxes or, Heaven forbid, loan the 
money to Ukraine instead of giving it 
to Ukraine. But Congress will do what 
Congress does best: spend other peo-
ple’s money. I, for one, will not. I will 
vote no. Somehow, somewhere, a voice 
of fiscal sanity must remain vigilant, 
must remain stalwart and steady in a 
sea of fiscal madness. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
INFLATION 
Mr. REED. Madam President, soaring 
fuel prices are impacting every corner 
of the globe and hitting the pocket-
books of American families and busi-
nesses. Today, a gallon of gas costs 
$4.52—nearly $1.50 more than a year 
ago. From food to clothing to rent, 
growing transportation expenses are 
pushing already rising prices even 
higher. 
Yet, while the American people are 
taking a hit, while the local mom-and- 
pop stores pay more for energy and 
goods, big oil companies are announc-
ing giant profits. They have hit the 
jackpot. 
Over the first 3 months of the year, 
ExxonMobil reported $5.5 billion in 
profits, Chevron recorded $6.3 billion, 
and Shell raked in $9.1 billion—its larg-
est quarterly profit ever. In just 3 
months, these three companies made 
nearly $21 billion in profits. 
Now, robust profits are usually a sig-
nal for companies to invest in capital 
and labor and build the foundation for 
future growth, but Big Oil has different 
priorities. Rather than increasing busi-
ness investment or production, these 
companies 
have 
almost 
uniformly 
pumped profits directly to their execu-
tives and wealthy shareholders. 
In February, even before the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices 
skyrocketing, the Financial Times re-
ported that seven of the largest oil 
companies—including Exxon, Chevron, 
BP, and Shell—were expected to return 
$38 billion to shareholders through 
buybacks this year, plus another $50 
billion in dividends. Big Oil hasn’t hid-
den its strategy: Hold back production, 
and rake in the profits. 
In a March 2022 survey, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Dallas asked oil ex-
ecutives for the primary reason that 
publicly traded oil companies were re-
straining production despite high oil 
prices. The No. 1 answer they gave, re-
flecting the view of nearly 60 percent of 
those surveyed, was that it was ‘‘inves-
tor pressure to maintain capital dis-
cipline.’’ To put it another way, they 
were saying that they don’t want to 
produce more oil because more produc-
tion will hasten the end of high oil 
prices and exorbitant investor profits. 
Some oil company executives have 
been even clearer. Just last month, 
Chevron’s chief financial officer con-
firmed that the company’s top priority 
is its dividends, not investing in its 
business, and BP’s CFO made similar 
comments during his company’s first 
quarter earnings call—so much for 
BP’s advertising campaign that it is in-
vesting in green energy. 
Instead of resuming the production 
they cut in 2020, oil companies have 
kept output constrained, turning a 50- 
percent increase in prices at the pump 
over the past year into record-setting 
profits. 
Make no mistake, our domestic pro-
ducers have the capacity to produce 
more. Indeed, domestic crude oil out-
put is below 2019 levels—that is right, 
domestic crude oil output is below 2019 
levels—and over 12 million acres of 
leased Federal lands remain untapped. 
My Republican colleagues are quick 
to try to weakly blame President Biden 
and ‘‘regulation’’ for lagging produc-
tion, but that is not what the oil ex-
ecutives say. Look back at that Dallas 
Fed survey I mentioned earlier. Only 6 
percent of the oil executives surveyed 
said that ‘‘government regulation’’ was 
the reason they weren’t producing 
more. Sixty percent said it was higher 
profits. Six percent said it was regula-
tion. 
Now, I understand private companies 
are going to pursue high profits. That 
is business, that is free enterprise, and 
that is a competitive market. But 
when Putin and OPEC have outsized in-
fluence on the market, can we really 
call it a competitive market? 
Look, the major oil companies can’t 
control what Putin or OPEC does, but 
there is no doubt that Putin’s war is 
taking their profits into the strato-
sphere. 
And oil companies clearly think this 
is a great time for more dividends and 
more buybacks, not more production, 
lower prices, and giving the American 
people a break. In fact, just last 
month, Exxon announced it would tri-
ple its stock buybacks this year and 
next to $30 billion. Thirty billion dol-
lars is an astonishing number. 
One of the things about buybacks is 
that they essentially raise the price of 
the company’s stock. If you are an ex-
ecutive whose major compensation is 
stock options, you are giving yourself a 
huge raise, and that is part of this too. 
It is self-aggrandizement. It is some-
thing that does not square, I think, 
with the feelings of the American peo-
ple and also the needs of the American 
people. 
It is clear that the oil companies are 
not interested in helping Americans on 
their own, so the Federal Government 
needs to step in. We need responsible 
solutions that bring down prices and 
help families pay for the basics. 
We must use every tool at our dis-
posal. I fully support the President’s 
pledge to release a million barrels of 
oil per day from the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to help stabilize volatile 
prices. One can imagine the price at 
the pump if the President was not 
doing this. It would be even further in 
excess of what is, I think, appropriate. 
I have introduced the Food and Fuel 
Family Savings Act, which would pro-
vide most households with $600 per per-
son, specifically to cover higher gas 
and grocery costs this year. My bill 
would be fully paid for, targeted to 
those families making under $80,000, 
and would also ease medium- and long- 
term inflation by crafting a fairer tax 
code. Instead of waiting for inflation to 
disappear, it would provide immediate 
and real help to Americans. 
I have also joined my colleague Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE in introducing legis-
lation to return some of those windfall 
profits that oil companies are handing 
out as dividends and buybacks back to 
consumers. 
These are important short-term ef-
forts that will help Americans strug-
gling with higher costs. But to truly 
lower costs in the long term, we must 
make the transition to clean energy 
and break our reliance on Big Oil and 
hostile foreign actors. I am proud that 
in Rhode Island, we are leading the 
way on offshore wind, a good renewable 
resource that when deployed will lower 
costs for consumers. 
The bipartisan infrastructure law is 
also making key investments to ad-
vance this transition, including over 
$60 billion primarily for new major 
clean energy demonstration and de-
ployment programs. 
The President has been calling for 
additional funding to enable this clean 
energy future. We need a package that 
includes tax credits and grants that 
would make clean energy, clean vehi-
cles, and other clean technologies more 
affordable and competitive. 
If we do these things, we will make 
ourselves less vulnerable to the whims 
of oil companies and cartels that de-
pend on Americans paying more than 
they should. We will make our world 
cleaner, 
lower 
costs, 
and 
finally 
achieve the energy independence that 
we have wanted all along. 
One of the many lessons of the past 2 
years is that we cannot rely on oil for

plentiful, affordable energy. It is clear 
that allowing our energy needs to be 
held hostage by leaders like Vladimir 
Putin and organizations like OPEC is 
dangerous, but placing our faith in Big 
Oil is equally foolhardy given their 
preoccupation with profits over people. 
As we battle inflation, it is the 
American people, not executives and 
wealthy shareholders, who should be 
the focal point of our energy and eco-
nomic policy.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
BUFFALO, NEW YORK, SHOOTING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, it 
has been a sorrowful, painful few days 
for the people of Buffalo, NY. Earlier 
today, I joined with President Biden, 
the First Lady, Governor Hochul, Sen-
ator 
GILLIBRAND, 
Buffalo’s 
Mayor 
Brown, Attorney General Tish James, 
and other local officials to meet with 
families of those killed on Saturday, to 
visit the Tops supermarket where the 
shooting happened and to grieve with 
the community that has been ripped 
apart by unspeakable violence. 
There is no single word to encap-
sulate what it was like to visit the 
Tops supermarket, to lay down flowers 
in honor of the dead, and to meet the 
families whose lives have been for-
ever—forever—torn apart. 
It was equal parts sorrow for the in-
nocent victims we have lost. It was 
grief for the families who must carry 
on. Today, I met a young boy, only 3 
years old, who lost his dad on Saturday 
because his dad was at the store buying 
his kid a birthday cake, just heart-
breaking. 
It was also with anger that somebody 
could act with such horrible evil. And 
yet, despite all that, it was hope. Hope 
that somehow, some way, this beloved 
community will find the will and the 
grace and the courage to cohere. I 
know, I know in my heart of hearts, 
that they will. 
To the people in Buffalo I met today, 
I say this: All of New York and all of 
America stands with you in this hour 
of deep darkness. We love you; we hold 
you in our hearts; and we pray for each 
and every one of you. We will be with 
you in spirit at every prayer service 
and every march and in every moment 
of silence. 
Today, we are all Buffalonians. I just 
don’t know what could possess some-
one to bring violence to a place like 
the East Side. I just don’t. But what we 
do know is that in each passing day, 
new and frightening details emerge 
about the lengths to which the shooter 
planned his attack. We know that the 
shooter chose Tops supermarket in 
order to target as many Black Ameri-
cans as possible. 
It is a supermarket I know well. I 
helped bring it to the East Side decades 
ago because they were a food desert 
and needed a supermarket, and I per-
suaded the owners of Tops to open one. 
And as the years grew, that super-
market became not just a supermarket 
but a community convening place. And 
when this awful man went to Tops to 
do his terrible shooting, it was like 
putting a dagger in the heart of the 
community because the supermarket 
had really been much more than a su-
permarket. 
And we know through online posts 
that the terrorist—that is what he 
could be called—likely visited the Tops 
market months ago in a reconnais-
sance mission to map out the store, to 
observe the security guards, and even 
to find a parking spot. We know all 
that. 
We know that had he gotten away, he 
intended to carry out more shootings 
at another store. 
And one other thing we know, we 
know that his reprehensible views—his 
racist, White supremacist views—be-
long to an extreme ideology of hate 
that is increasingly finding home in 
the American mainstream. 
In Buffalo, the President was right to 
strongly condemn these views with the 
whole Nation watching. All elected of-
ficials—all elected officials—should do 
the same. 
The ‘‘great replacement’’ or ‘‘replace-
ment theory’’ used to be something 
that was found only in the darkest cor-
ners of deranged minds and in the deep-
est trenches of the internet. But today, 
sadly, indisputably, you don’t need to 
go online anymore to find White ‘‘re-
placement theory’’ rhetoric. You can 
find it on cable TV from the comfort of 
your own couch. 
And perhaps no network has had 
more impact in propagating and nor-
malizing the rhetoric of ‘‘replacement 
theory’’ than FOX News. 
To follow up from my remarks yes-
terday, this morning I sent a letter to 
Rupert Murdoch, to FOX News execu-
tives, and to Tucker Carlson, imploring 
the network and Mr. Carlson to cease 
their amplification of ‘‘replacement 
theory’’ on their network. 
According to one study, Mr. Carlson 
has used rhetoric echoing ‘‘replace-
ment theory’’ on at least 400 episodes 
of his show—400 episodes—which has an 
average nightly audience of 3 million 
people. 
It is dangerous and un-American for 
one of the biggest news networks in the 
world to amplify conspiracy theories 
that are eerily similar to those cited 
by the Buffalo shooter. 
And to those who think this is an ex-
aggeration, to those who refuse to ac-
knowledge that fringe White suprema-
cist views are now increasingly out in 
the open, I would simply ask them: 
Where were you on the night that thou-
sands of White supremacists marched 
openly on the streets of Charlottes-
ville, bearing torches and chanting, 
‘‘You will not replace us’’? That is 
what they said, ‘‘You will not replace 
us.’’ 
Where were you when thousands of 
insurrectionists stormed into the Halls 
of this Capitol, waving Confederate 
flags and donning sweatshirts about 
the Holocaust? 
Where have you been during any 
Trump rally, where the Republican 
standard-bearer goes on and on about 
undocumented immigrants stealing the 
2020 election—a message parroted by 
countless 
MAGA 
Republican 
can-
didates across the country. 
And where were you when White su-
premacists shot up a Walmart in El 
Paso, a synagogue in Pittsburgh, spas 
in Atlanta and a Black church in 
Charleston—or at a grocery store in 
Buffalo, NY? 
It would be the easiest thing in the 
world to denounce something as evil 
and vile and un-American as ‘‘replace-
ment theory.’’ 
To its credit, this week, the Wall 
Street Journal editorial board ac-
knowledged 
that 
‘‘politicians 
and 
media figures have an obligation to 
condemn . . . such conspiratorial no-
tions as ‘white replacement theory.’ ’’ 
But while that is necessary, it is 
hardly sufficient, and too many MAGA 
Republicans refuse to do even just 
that. 
And last night, Tucker Carlson did 
not do that either. He deflected and re-
fused to acknowledge that a clear con-
nection exists between the messages on 
his shows and some of the views cham-
pioned by these mass shooters. 
He dismissed the shooter’s 180-page 
rant as the product of a ‘‘diseased and 
disorganized mind,’’ while omitting 
that the shooter’s mind was diseased 
and 
warped 
precisely—precisely—by 
online conspiracy theories that are 
echoed regularly on his show. 
The plain fact is that the shooter re-
sponsible for the violent murder of 10 
innocent lives espoused the same false 
and racist conspiracy theories that 
Tucker Carlson has pushed to his audi-
ence 400 times and which far too many 
MAGA Republicans, including former 
President Trump, are happy to am-
plify. 
Tucker 
Carlson 
and, 
indeed, 
all 
voices of influence in this country 
should come out and not just condemn 
racial violence, not just condemn ra-
cial theory but refuse to give these 
false and racist conspiracy theories a 
platform. 
Let me say it again: Anchors like 
Tucker Carlson, and, in fact, all MAGA 
Republicans and all voices of influence 
across the political spectrum, should 
not just condemn racial violence, not 
just denounce White supremacist views 
like ‘‘replacement theory’’ but further 
refuse to give these false and racist 
conspiracy theories a platform whatso-
ever.

May 17, 2022 
It is horrific to see that most on the 
hard right haven’t done that to date. 
Until we unite to stomp views like 
‘‘replacement theory’’ out of existence, 
until we band together to call these 
vile conspiracy theories for what they 
are—White supremacist propaganda— 
we cannot find closure to the attacks 
like the one we saw this weekend in 
Buffalo, NY. 
And communities across the country, 
especially communities of color, will 
continue to live in fear that at any mo-
ment they may be targeted by violence 
just because of who they are. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SOUTH DAKOTA STORMS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, be-
fore I begin, I want to mention the se-
vere storms that hit eastern South Da-
kota last Thursday. 
I visited Castlewood on Saturday, 
which is among the communities that 
was hardest hit, to get a look at the 
damage, and it is extensive. Homes and 
a school have been damaged, destroyed. 
Many of our farmers were hit hard and 
lost critical equipment and buildings. 
I just want our thoughts and prayers 
to go out to those South Dakotans who 
were affected and, in particular, the 
family and friends of the two women 
who were killed in the storm. 
My office will be doing everything 
possible to help those affected get the 
assistance that they need to recover. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Madam President, this week is Na-
tional Police Week—a time set aside to 
honor the service of our Nation’s law 
enforcement officers and pay tribute to 
those who have made the ultimate sac-
rifice in the line of duty. 
While there are a number of tough 
jobs out there, being a law enforcement 
officer is in a different league. I can 
think of only one other career path 
where willingness to lay down your life 
for your fellow citizens is part of the 
job description. 
Law enforcement officers don’t know 
what they will face when they get up 
every day. They don’t know what they 
face when they respond to a call, but 
they go out anyway. We call, and they 
come, day or night, no matter the dan-
ger. 
In addition to the physical dangers 
that they face, police officers also bear 
a heavy mental burden. Most of us 
don’t have to confront evil in our lives 
every day, thanks in large part to the 
sacrifices of our Nation’s law enforce-
ment officers. But police officers have 
to get up close and personal with evil 
on a daily basis. They get a front-row 
seat when it comes to seeing fallen hu-
manity, and they pay a price. 
Being a police officer has always 
been a tough job, but over the past cou-
ple of years, it has gotten even harder. 
The ‘‘defund the police’’ movement and 
the anti-law enforcement sentiment 
have taken a tremendous toll on police 
departments and police officers. 
Morale has sunk, which has resulted 
in increased resignations and retire-
ments. Police departments are under-
staffed, which has stretched officers to 
the limit and limited their ability to 
respond to crimes. And, unsurprisingly, 
police departments are struggling to 
recruit officers. 
Being a police officer is a difficult 
enough job as it is. It is not surprising 
that people would be reluctant to go 
into this field, knowing that the re-
ward for their sacrifice will be constant 
criticism and vilification. 
‘‘Defund the police’’ rhetoric has also 
put officers in increased danger. I find 
it hard to believe that the 59-percent 
increase in murders of police officers in 
2021 had nothing to do with the fanning 
of anti-police sentiment. 
And ‘‘defund the police’’ rhetoric and 
soft-on-crime policies associated with 
it are taking a toll on public safety and 
contributing to the surge in violent 
crime that we have been seeing. 
The ‘‘defund the police’’ movement is 
a movement that should have never 
gotten off the ground. It is based on a 
lie that America’s law enforcement of-
ficers are evil and racist. 
It is also based on the absurd premise 
that society can exist without the po-
lice or that police officers can be re-
placed by social workers and psycholo-
gists. 
There may well be individuals who 
fall into a life of crime as a result of 
tough circumstances, but there are 
also a lot of criminals who choose evil 
deliberately, not because of a difficult 
past but simply for their own personal 
gain, whether that looks like money or 
power or revenge or violence. 
And as long as we live in a world 
where people deliberately choose evil, 
we are going to need men and women 
who are willing to step up and confront 
that evil and do their best to ensure 
that the perpetrators face justice. 
When the ‘‘defund the police’’ move-
ment arose 2 years ago, the Democratic 
Party should have stepped up and de-
nounced it. Instead, they equivocated, 
and some Democrats openly embraced 
‘‘defund the police’’ rhetoric. 
Now the President and other Demo-
crats, perhaps motivated by poll num-
bers showing that Americans are seri-
ously concerned about crime, are try-
ing to distance themselves from anti- 
law enforcement rhetoric. But it is 
pretty difficult to take the President 
seriously on this when he has filled key 
administration posts with individuals 
who have spoken supportively about 
‘‘defund the police’’ efforts. 
Even the Vice President is on the 
record praising efforts to divert money 
from police departments. 
‘‘Defund the police’’ rhetoric needs to 
disappear from our public discourse. 
We need to be making it clear as a soci-
ety that policing is an essential job and 
that police officers perform an essen-
tial public service. 
I am proud to support legislation like 
the Back the Blue Act, which would in-
crease penalties for deliberately tar-
geting a law enforcement officer and 
give officers new tools to protect them-
selves. 
Police officers face the possibility of 
serious injury or death on a daily basis. 
The least we can do is to make sure 
that we are doing everything we can to 
discourage attacks on our law enforce-
ment officers. 
In addition to supporting legislation 
like the Back the Blue Act and the 
Protect and Serve Act, I will continue 
to urge the President to take action to 
secure the border. 
Border security is not just something 
that affects border communities. Lax 
border security has consequences for 
the entire country. South Dakota law 
enforcement leaders and officials tell 
me that they are seizing drugs that 
they can trace directly back to the car-
tels that smuggle these drugs across 
the border. 
We currently have a very serious 
fentanyl problem in this country. In 
fact, right now, fentanyl overdose is 
the leading cause of death for U.S. 
adults between the ages of 18 and 45. 
And where is all this fentanyl coming 
from? 
Mostly, it is being trafficked across 
our southern border. And there is no 
question that the worse the situation 
at the border gets, the easier it is for 
drug smugglers to evade detection and 
capture, which means more drugs flow-
ing into our country and more of our 
law enforcement officers having to deal 
with the consequences. 
In my job, I have the privilege of 
interacting with law enforcement regu-
larly, whether it is members of the 
Capitol Police who protect Congress or 
local law enforcement in my home 
State of South Dakota. As a Senator, I 
have been in more than one situation 
where I have gotten to see up close 
what happens when danger threatens 
and law enforcement officers step into 
the breach to protect those in peril. 
I am more grateful than I can say for 
all the men and women in South Da-
kota, in Washington, DC, and around 
the country who have made the choice 
to serve. 
I am also tremendously grateful for 
their families. It is no small thing to 
say goodbye to a husband or wife or a 
mom or dad every morning knowing 
that there is a chance that he or she 
may not come home that night. No 
mention of the sacrifices made by our 
law enforcement officers would be com-
plete without mentioning the sacrifices 
made by their families. 
The mission statement of the police 
department in Rapid City, SD, is 
‘‘Community First, Service Above Self, 
Integrity-Driven. One Interaction at a 
Time.’’ Well, that definitely describes 
our Rapid City officers, and it is a pret-
ty good description, I might add, of law

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for up 
to 15 minutes prior to the scheduled 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATO 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
well, as has since been reported in the 
news despite our efforts to keep word 
of our travel somewhat under wraps be-
fore it was accomplished, this last 
weekend, Senators COLLINS, BARRASSO, 
and I had the honor of traveling to 
Ukraine with Senator MCCONNELL on a 
trip where we visited not only Presi-
dent Zelenskyy in the Presidential pal-
ace but also visited two of what we 
hope will be the next members of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
namely, Sweden and Finland. 
As we all know, it has been nearly 3 
months 
now 
since 
Russia 
invaded 
Ukraine. There is no telling what 
President Putin expected. Perhaps he 
expected to be able to occupy Ukraine 
without firing a shot. But the fact is 
that the Ukrainians’ spirit and will to 
defend their country remain unbroken 
and undaunted, and Putin’s plans have 
failed and failed miserably. 
We saw this firsthand when we had a 
chance to visit Kyiv this weekend. Be-
fore the invasion, Kyiv was a cultural, 
religious, and economic hub for the 
great country of Ukraine. Despite 
being damaged by Russia’s failed at-
tempt to seize the city and occupy 
Ukraine, 
Kyiv 
still 
embodies 
the 
Ukrainian will to survive against all 
odds. 
When we were there, we met, of 
course, with President Zelenskyy and 
his advisers. They have done what I 
think we all hope we would do in the 
face of an unprovoked invasion, and 
that is to remain steadfast in dedica-
tion to your people and your country. 
President Zelenskyy’s leadership has 
inspired free nations and free people 
around the world. His unwavering com-
mitment to Ukraine and its sov-
ereignty has helped rally the rest of 
the freedom-loving world to come to 
the aid of Ukraine in a number of dif-
ferent ways. President Zelenskyy, of 
course, is a product of Ukrainian cul-
ture that values strength, resilience, a 
love of homeland, and we know that 
the people of Ukraine are the same and 
certainly no different. 
The Ukrainian people are determined 
not just to defend their country but to 
win in this fight against Russia, and 
that is what they have been doing. 
What they have asked of us is to give 
them the tools they need to fight their 
own fight. 
Since the earliest days of this inva-
sion, the United States has provided 
billions of dollars in military and hu-
manitarian assistance, and we continue 
looking to President Zelenskyy so we 
can understand what more is needed. 
This is not only a security crisis, this 
is a humanitarian crisis as well since 
Ukraine is known generally as the 
bread basket of Europe. He and his ad-
visers warned us about the possibility 
of global food shortages caused by a 
Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports. 
This will lead to widespread famine not 
just in Europe but throughout Africa 
and spread the pain far afield from Eu-
rope. 
When it comes to military aid, Presi-
dent Zelenskyy emphasized a message 
he has consistently shared with us: We 
need more, and we need it faster—more 
Stingers, more Javelins, more air de-
fenses, more lethal aid. 
Last week, President Biden signed a 
bill that I introduced along with Sen-
ators WICKER, CARDIN, and SHAHEEN, 
which was called the Ukraine Democ-
racy Lend-Lease Act. 
This legislation is rooted in the same 
lend-lease legislation that President 
Roosevelt signed into law in 1941 which 
allowed the United States to supply 
Great Britain and other allies with 
military equipment. At that time, 
President Roosevelt vowed to trans-
form the United States into what he 
called the ‘‘arsenal of democracy,’’ and 
the Lend-Lease Act helped accomplish 
that. 
This legislation, the Ukrainian De-
mocracy Lend-Lease Act, which has 
now been signed into law by President 
Biden, cuts redtape so we can quickly 
give Ukraine what it needs to win the 
war against Russia. 
During 
our 
visit, 
President 
Zelenskyy shared with us the impor-
tance of this historic lend-lease pro-
gram. We also discussed our commit-
ment to helping Ukraine until they are 
victorious and encourage our allies and 
partners around the world to work with 
us—to continue to work with us to 
make sure that Ukraine has what it 
needs to defend itself. 
Of course, we are now, as I said, just 
shy of 3 months into this war, and we 
know that we will be called upon to do 
more, but we all have a part to play in 
ensuring that Putin ultimately aban-
dons as futile this mission to recreate 
the Soviet Union. 
This week, as we know, the Senate 
will consider a supplemental funding 
bill to provide Ukraine with even more 
security and humanitarian assistance. 
I know there are some who disagree 
with more funding for Ukraine. To 
them I would say, this funding, this 
support, this military and humani-
tarian support is not strictly an act of 
altruism on our part. We are doing this 
also because allowing Ukraine to de-
fend itself is in our best interest. We 
can’t kid ourselves by thinking that 
Putin would simply end with his brutal 
conquest of Ukraine or if he did, that 
he wouldn’t start it up again in the 
near future. If Putin took Ukraine or a 
sizable portion of its geography, this 
would be just the next domino to fall in 
Putin’s mad drive to try to cobble to-
gether whatever he can of the old Rus-
sian Empire, which would have ex-
treme consequences for America and 
the rest of the world. 
Even though Ukraine is not a mem-
ber of the North Atlantic Treaty Orga-
nization, the outcome of this war will 
without a doubt have an impact on the 
United States and our NATO allies. An 
invasion of a NATO country would 
trigger article 5 of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Alliance, which would require 
us to come to the aid and defense of a 
fellow member of that alliance. 
Already Putin has made threats 
against Moldova, Romania, and now 
Sweden and Finland. His actions are an 
attack on the entire West and threaten 
peace and security around the world. It 
is literally a threat on the idea of free-
dom itself. Today, the frontline is 
Ukraine. Where that frontline will 
shift tomorrow is largely up to us and 
the Ukrainians. 
Peace on the European continent is a 
peace fought for and won by the sac-
rifices of many who came before us. Ob-
viously, we have experienced an un-
precedented period of peace and pros-
perity around the world following the 
Second World War. Having experienced 
two world wars on the same continent 
over a period of 40 or 50 years, anybody 
in their right mind would look for ways 
to try to resist and reduce the likeli-
hood of another war in Europe during 
our lifetime. 
It was because of the sacrifices of our 
parents and grandparents that we have 
had this, what Bob Gates, the former 
Secretary of Defense, has called a holi-
day from history. Most of us have 
grown up knowing nothing but the 
peace and prosperity bought with the 
contributions and sacrifices of our par-
ents and grandparents. But we now 
have our own responsibility, not only 
to our communities, to our families, 
and to our Nation to act in the face of 
this aggression, we have to contribute 
our part to the preservation of freedom 
and democracy around the world by 
helping Ukraine defend its freedom and 
its democracy. 
Of course our support for Ukraine has 
costs, but every position will entail a 
cost. Of course, in this situation, the 
cost of the United States doing noth-
ing, of simply turning over this democ-
racy and our security and our economy 
to Putin, well, that is greater than any 
cost that could come by a supple-
mental appropriation that the U.S. 
Congress 
might 
make 
to 
assist

May 17, 2022 
Ukraine. We know that world wars 
have been started by lesser action, and 
we must do everything we can to pre-
vent this contagion from spreading be-
yond its current boundaries. 
So what is at stake here is greater 
than the future of any one nation. The 
security of Europe is in question. The 
reach of Russia’s aspirations to rees-
tablish its former empire are as well. 
And we know that there are global re-
percussions however we choose to re-
spond. 
Of course, other adversaries of the 
United States are watching to see what 
we do. China, Iran, and North Korea 
are looking for any sign of weakness 
that would permit them to take advan-
tage of that weakness to do something 
similar to what Putin is doing. We can-
not show these authoritarian govern-
ments or their leaders any weakness 
that might encourage them to rep-
licate Putin’s unprovoked aggression. 
While abroad, as I said, we visited 
with the leadership of Finland and 
Sweden at a pivotal and historic time 
for them. Both countries have histori-
cally been nonaligned with any warring 
power, but they realize the imminent 
threat of this invasion of Ukraine, 
what that means to them and their 
safety and their security. Both coun-
tries are now in the process of applying 
for membership in the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, and I am pleased 
to see that they will move forward 
with that decision and are as I speak. 
Adding them to this alliance which 
has produced the longest unbroken pe-
riod of peace and security of any treaty 
that the United States has been a part 
of, their participation will give the 
United States crucial partners in Scan-
dinavia and in the High North and in 
the Arctic region, and it will nearly 
double the land border Russia shares 
with NATO countries. 
You know, it is ironic that Putin said 
that one reason he invaded Ukraine is 
he did not want Ukraine to become 
part of NATO. He didn’t want NATO on 
his border. Well, thanks to his missteps 
and miscalculation, now he will find 
Finland, with an 830-mile border, a 
member of NATO and on the Russian 
border—exactly what he said he hoped 
to avoid. 
Now, I applaud the parliaments of 
both Sweden and Finland for breaking 
with their longstanding provisions of 
neutrality in order to serve the best in-
terests of their people and to con-
tribute to the collective security of Eu-
rope. Sweden and Finland will be much 
safer thanks to this bold decision by 
their governments, and they will cer-
tainly add value to NATO and enhance 
the deterrence of this collective de-
fense agreement known as the North 
Atlantic Treaty alliance. 
During our meetings, I told our col-
leagues, our parliamentarians from 
Sweden and Finland, that I backed 
their accessions unequivocally. Both of 
these countries have seen and acted on 
a major lesson from Putin’s invasion of 
Ukraine: Putin does not honor inter-
nationally agreed-upon borders no mat-
ter what the cost. Sweden and Finland 
both have robust, well-resourced mili-
taries, and I look forward as one Sen-
ator to welcoming them into NATO, 
and I hope all of our colleagues will 
agree with that when the time comes. 
I am grateful to Leader MCCONNELL 
for putting together this past week-
end’s trip. I found it enormously edu-
cational, and I think it sent a great 
message, 
not 
only 
to 
President 
Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people 
that we will continue to support them, 
whether it is with lethal aid or human-
itarian assistance, but, likewise, I 
think it sent a message to our impend-
ing additions to NATO—Sweden and 
Finland—that we will support their ad-
dition to NATO when the time comes 
here in the U.S. Senate. 
Lastly, I want to share a message 
from Ukraine. President Zelenskyy 
asked us, as Representatives of our 
various States and the American peo-
ple, to convey to the American people 
his personal thanks and gratitude for 
supporting them during this existential 
fight with Russia. We, in turn, thanked 
President Zelenskyy for showing the 
world what one country and what one 
inspired leader can do to rally the 
cause of freedom and democracy and 
nonaggression around the world. 
President Zelenskyy and the Ukrain-
ians have changed the course of history 
for the better, and we unequivocally 
are with the Ukrainian people in their 
fight to remain a sovereign democracy. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today for the 12th 
consecutive week while the Senate has 
been in session to talk about the ille-
gal, unprovoked, and brutal assault on 
Ukraine being carried out by Russia. 
We started these discussions before 
this latest invasion even occurred; and, 
unfortunately, every week, as I talk 
about it, there are more and more ex-
amples of brutality as the Russians 
continue to bomb innocent civilians in 
Ukraine. Also, we have been able to 
talk about some progress that we have 
made in helping Ukraine, and that has 
been very effective in helping Ukraine 
help itself. 
This is a classic fight for freedom. 
The importance of our humanitarian 
aid, our weapons, and our material sup-
port have all been in that cause, and 
the impact cannot be overstated. Since 
February 24, when the invasion began, 
we have provided $13.6 billion in U.S. 
taxpayer funds for military, humani-
tarian, and economic aid for Ukraine. 
By the way, it has made a huge dif-
ference in keeping Ukraine from being 
totally overrun by Russia. You will re-
member that the Russian objective 
here, in looking at this map, was to 
take over the entire country. In start-
ing with Kyiv, remember that they sur-
rounded Kyiv at one point. Now they 
have been pushed out altogether. 
The Russians have now been forced 
to just focus here, in the southern and

May 17, 2022 
eastern parts of Ukraine, where there 
continues to be very fierce fighting. 
These darker red sections are sections 
that the Russians took back in 2014. 
The lighter red are the sections of 
Ukraine they are trying to take now. 
The blue, you can see here, is where 
the Ukrainians have made progress, in-
cluding around Kharkiv, which is a 
major city here in Eastern Ukraine. 
You can see where there is quite a bit 
of blue—in fact, in one case, all the 
way to the Russian border where the 
Ukrainians have pushed back the Rus-
sians. 
So our support has made a difference. 
But that support—the $13.6 billion in 
aid—has now been depleted, and it is 
necessary for us to re-up, including in 
just providing basic munitions so that 
the Ukrainians can continue the fight 
with ammunition but also in providing 
heavier weapons because, down in this 
area, that is what is required. As the 
Russians use more and more artillery 
and other heavy weapons to try to push 
back the Ukrainians’ positions, the 
Ukrainians must respond in kind. 
Without the support that we have 
provided, Russia would have destroyed 
a lot more of Ukraine; they would have 
killed a lot more innocent civilians; 
and they would have achieved a vic-
tory. It would have been damaging, of 
course, to Ukraine and its people but 
also damaging to us and our national 
interest and a safer world because, had 
they been successful, there would have 
been a much more dangerous and vola-
tile world in its thinking that an au-
thoritarian country could just come 
into a peaceful, democratic neighbor 
and take over another country. 
Again, the fighting continues, but 
we, along with so many of our allies— 
over 40 countries—over 40 countries— 
have stepped up to say: We are with 
you, Ukraine. You are an independent, 
sovereign country. You are an ally, and 
we want to support you. 
They have never asked for us to do 
the fighting for them, by the way, but 
they have asked for us to help them 
have the tools to be able to survive and 
to be able to push back against the 
brutal Russian assault. 
The administration has now sub-
mitted what is called a supplemental 
request for funding. The House passed 
it last week 368 to 57—strong bipartisan 
support. Last night and earlier today, 
we had the first of two procedural 
votes on the Senate’s action on this 
same supplemental spending bill. The 
votes were 81 to 11 last night and 88 to 
11 earlier today—again, strong bipar-
tisan support for this funding. This 
package includes $40 billion—nearly $40 
billion—for munitions, for weapons, for 
training to stop Russia. 
It also provides funds for humani-
tarian aid. Remember, there have been 
millions of refugees both internally 
and who have left the country. There 
are about 5 or 6 million refugees still 
out of the country and at least 7 or 8 
million refugees inside the country. So 
this has been an unprecedented level of 
humanitarian aid that has been needed 
but also economic support to a country 
that 
has 
been 
devastated—literally 
flattened—in many areas by this Rus-
sian assault. 
There are also funds to support our 
troops, who are in the countries neigh-
boring Ukraine, joining other NATO 
forces. That funding is also in here. 
Some of these troops came from Ger-
many, and some came from the United 
States, but it is an effort to be sure 
that we are supporting and bolstering 
these other countries in the region— 
Romania, Slovakia, Poland, and the 
Baltic countries of Latvia, Lithuania, 
and Estonia—to be sure that they are 
not going to be subject to the same at-
tacks. Those preventive measures have 
been put in place, and that is also cost-
ly. Forty billion dollars is a lot of 
money, and we have to be sure that it 
is spent wisely and is not wasted. 
I am glad to see we were able to get 
some changes in the administration’s 
request to task the Department of De-
fense, the Department of State, and 
USAID inspectors general—from all 
three of those entities—with the over-
sight of the spending and provide them 
with sufficient resources to do that. So 
these inspectors general from those 
three entities are there to ensure the 
money is properly spent. 
Additionally, the funds in this bill 
for urgent budget support to Ukraine’s 
government will be subject to espe-
cially stringent oversight mechanisms. 
These funds will be placed in a sepa-
rate, auditable account, and their use 
will be governed by a memorandum of 
understanding with Ukraine. The MOU 
will 
describe 
strict 
guardrails 
for 
transparency and accountability that 
will ensure that these funds are not di-
verted to corrupt interests but, in-
stead, are used to help the Government 
of Ukraine provide for its people in 
their hour of need. I am glad that lan-
guage was included and added to the 
supplemental. 
The supplemental bill also mandates 
that the use of these funds will be noti-
fied to Congress. I think this is very 
important. Most of our foreign assist-
ance to other countries is subject to 
strict notification requirements like 
these. It is only appropriate these 
funds have a similar mechanism in 
place. If Congress is going to appro-
priate these large amounts of taxpayer 
dollars to support Ukraine, I think it is 
essential that we have sufficient con-
gressional oversight. We have strong 
bipartisan support for this funding in 
the House and in the Senate but also 
the assurance that we will have effec-
tive oversight of our assistance to 
Ukraine. By the way, effective over-
sight also will require us to have a dip-
lomatic presence in Ukraine—a perma-
nent one—to help ensure that these 
funds are spent properly—the military 
funds, the humanitarian funds, and the 
economic aid. 
I have been calling for the adminis-
tration to reopen our Embassy in Kyiv, 
which is here—the capital city—for the 
past several weeks. I hope we do that 
as soon as possible. My understanding 
is that the team in Kyiv, which has 
been mostly in Poland and sometimes 
goes to Lviv, wants to get back to the 
capital. There are, probably, a couple 
dozen countries—I heard Israel moved 
their Embassy back today—that have 
already moved back to Kyiv. It is time 
for us to do so as well. We understand 
it is dangerous, and we respect the 
service of those Foreign Service Offi-
cers, but we have got to be sure that 
they are there to provide a clear line of 
communication with the Ukrainians 
and ensure that this $40 billion in fund-
ing is properly spent but also ensure 
that we are able to have a go-between 
at a high level, which is one reason we 
need to get our Ambassador over there 
to Ukraine as soon as possible. The 
good news is we had a good hearing 
with that Ambassador just last week, 
and my hope is that we can get her 
moving even later this week. 
With regard to the funding—the $40 
billion—in helping, again, to continue 
to push back so that Russia doesn’t 
turn the tide, that funding, I hope, will 
be sent this week. What you just heard 
from the majority leader is that he has 
set up a vote for Thursday, which 
would be a cloture vote. Then, hope-
fully, we will have the final vote that 
day, too. Cloture is the next procedural 
vote. Let’s not slow this thing down on 
either side of the aisle. Let’s get this 
done. I wish we had gotten it done last 
week, and we should have. Every day 
that we delay means we are putting at 
risk more Ukrainian civilians and put-
ting at risk more of the Ukrainian 
military because they don’t have the 
munitions for existing weapons, be-
cause they don’t have the heavy weap-
ons they need to be able to counter the 
Russians. So this is not a time for us to 
play partisan politics. It is a time for 
us to get this assistance to the Presi-
dent’s desk. Hopefully, he will sign it 
immediately and begin to re-up this 
commitment we have made to help 
Ukraine defend itself. 
As you probably know, it took the 
constant urging from this Congress, on 
a bipartisan basis, to get the adminis-
tration to finally begin to provide the 
level of lethal support that the Ukrain-
ians have needed to survive this war 
against Russia. Some of us were push-
ing for more before this latest invasion 
as well, but we cannot afford to back-
slide now. It is really important that 
we continue to help them to be able to 
defend themselves. Again, we are not 
alone in this. There are many countries 
around the world, including, obviously, 
the other NATO allies who are also 
helping out. 
I understand there is only enough ex-
isting Presidential drawdown author-
ity—that is the authority they are 
using for the munitions and the weap-
ons—to do one more partial transfer of 
arms. So this is urgent to get it done 
now. This supplemental will fix that 
problem. It raises the Presidential cap 
to $11 billion in the drawdown author-
ity. It also provides $6 billion for the

Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, 
which is a program that I co-wrote 
back into law in 2015. This money will 
fund training, equipment, and advisory 
efforts to boost Ukraine’s combat ca-
pacities; to professionalize its military 
further; and to bring it up to NATO 
standards. 
That was very important to have 
them as prepared as they are. Over the 
past 7 years, it has helped turn 
Ukraine’s army into a powerful, profes-
sional fighting force that has proven to 
be at least Russia’s equal on the battle-
field. The bravery and determination of 
these troops is the single most impor-
tant weapon they have, but the train-
ing and the equipment and the muni-
tions and so on are essential for them 
to be able to take that bravery and 
that perseverance and that commit-
ment and to be able to be such an effec-
tive fighting force. 
Additionally, the supplemental in-
cludes $4 billion in Foreign Military 
Financing to provide Ukraine with the 
American-made weapons and equip-
ment that its troops need. It also has 
$3.9 billion to support enhanced U.S. 
troop deployments to Europe, such as 
the 82nd Airborne, which is here in Po-
land. I got to see them when I was over 
in the region recently. They are doing 
an amazing job in ensuring that there 
is protection for Poland against the 
possibility 
that 
Poland 
could 
be 
dragged into this conflict, but it is also 
to help ensure that the arms transfers 
are occurring from countries all over 
the world. All of this vital funding will 
ensure that we can continue to support 
Ukraine and our other Eastern Euro-
pean allies who are threatened by Rus-
sian aggression. We just can’t allow 
any gap in this support. 
We must not adjourn this week until 
we are finished with this. So the vote is 
supposed to be on Thursday, and I hope 
it is; but until we have the final pas-
sage of this measure and it goes to the 
President’s desk, we cannot leave this 
week. In my view, Congress must stay 
in session. 
At this time in this war, it is also 
time for us to take a breath and hold 
the administration accountable for giv-
ing us a long-term strategy so that we 
in Congress can be a bigger part of the 
conversation about how to move for-
ward. I think that is not unreasonable, 
given where we are. And a number of 
us, on a bipartisan basis, are calling for 
that. Give us a long-term strategy so 
we know where we are. 
I know there have been concerns that 
we have been spending a lot of money 
on weapons and equipment from our 
military stockpiles to Ukraine without 
adequately refilling our own supplies. 
But this supplemental funding bill— 
and one reason it is a higher number— 
fixes that. It provides $9 billion to re-
plenish 
our 
stocks 
with 
Javelins, 
Stingers, howitzers, rifles, vehicles, 
and other equipment needed to keep 
America safe. So part of the funds we 
are providing here are for Ukraine, but 
really they are for updating our own 
stockpiles. That is good for our own 
military. 
I am also aware of a concern that 
some of our manufacturers cannot 
make these weapons fast enough for 
both the stockpiling for our weapons 
and providing weapons to Ukraine. 
This supplemental bill addresses that, 
too, providing $600 million to ease 
chokepoints in our industrial supply 
chain. That will ensure that we have 
the capacity to produce enough mis-
siles 
to 
simultaneously 
help 
keep 
Ukrainians in the fight and keep our 
stockpiles full. 
Last week, at a hearing of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, I asked 
the Assistant Secretary of State for 
Europe, Karen Donfried, what the ad-
ministration’s definition of ‘‘victory’’ 
was, and she said: Well, ‘‘that is for the 
Ukrainians to define.’’ 
Well, I guess that is fair, but the 
Ukrainians have already defined what 
victory looks like for them. They want 
all of their territory back. It is their 
sovereign territory that Russia has al-
ready 
taken—the 
darker 
red—and 
wants to take now in the lighter red 
and wants to go even farther. That is 
what the Ukrainians say victory looks 
like. 
Last week, Ukrainian Foreign Min-
ister Kuleba said that ‘‘victory for us 
in this war will be the liberation of the 
rest of our territories.’’ 
On Saturday, the Foreign Ministers 
of the G7 countries—those are the big-
gest economies of the world except for 
China. Those are our allies in all of 
this. Our Secretary of State, Tony 
Blinken, was there, and he endorsed 
this view, saying in a statement that 
‘‘[w]e will never recognize borders that 
Russia has attempted to change by 
military aggression.’’ 
I appreciate the Secretary of State 
saying that, and I hope the rest of the 
administration adopts that position. 
During recent testimony, LTG Scott 
Barrier of the Defense Intelligence 
Agency called the war situation a 
‘‘stalemate.’’ While this is not optimal, 
it is giving the Ukrainian forces time 
to regroup forces in this area and to be 
able to train on some of the new West-
ern weapons we and our allies have do-
nated. Soon, more of our 155-milli-
meter ‘‘M Triple 7’’ howitzers, as an ex-
ample, 
will 
be 
deployed 
to 
the 
frontlines. This will give the Ukrain-
ians the capability to outrange the 
Russians, when they could sit back and 
use the artillery to push the Russians 
back without being in danger them-
selves. And when combined with sur-
veillance, 
including 
surveillance 
drones, this will allow the Ukrainians 
to even the odds on the battlefield. 
That is all arriving now and beginning 
to come, and that is good news to re-
port tonight. It is going to make a big 
difference. 
In fact, we have recently seen just 
how 
effective 
artillery 
can 
be 
in 
Ukraine. We just learned yesterday 
that last week, as a Russian battalion 
tactical group was attempting to cross 
a river in Ukraine, called the Siverskyi 
Donets River, Ukrainian artillerymen 
sighted them and opened fire. Over the 
next several minutes, under a Ukrain-
ian bombardment, it is estimated that 
Russian forces suffered almost 500 cas-
ualties—including killed, wounded, and 
missing in action—and also lost almost 
80 vehicles, including infantry fighting 
vehicles and T–72 main battle tanks. 
This map shows images of the actual 
bridge and what actually happened. 
Here is the attack. Here are some of 
those Russian tanks we talked about 
and other armored vehicles. Here is 
what is left of the bridge. Here are 
some more images of the road coming 
in and some of the vehicles that were 
destroyed. 
The pontoon bridge they had been 
using to cross the river right here, you 
can see, was totally destroyed, sending 
some vehicles plunging into the water 
below. This Russian advance was com-
pletely halted at immense cost. 
Again, it makes a difference if you 
have these weapons and you have the 
surveillance. You have the ability to do 
this. It was such a significant defeat 
for Russian forces that even the pro- 
Russian military bloggers—who have 
toed the Kremlin line for the war thus 
far—have now begun to publicly ques-
tion the competency of the Russian 
military leadership on social media. 
This is precisely why we and other 
countries need to keep sending heavy 
weapons and ammunition, including ar-
tillery and better artillery, so the 
Ukrainians can continue to inflict de-
feats like this on the Russians and 
push them out of their territory. 
The Ukrainians are succeeding, first, 
because of their bravery, their tenac-
ity, their skill but also because the 
United States and our allies are plac-
ing in their hands the tools they need 
to succeed. 
Let’s not forget that President Putin 
said he launched this war because 
Ukraine had NATO aspirations and 
that a NATO country on their border 
was a threat. I think he thought that 
this would be intimidating to NATO 
and would split NATO. Now, because of 
the invasion, Finland and Sweden have 
applied for NATO membership. Presi-
dent Putin thought it would split 
NATO; instead, NATO is actually get-
ting stronger. 
America and the world should recog-
nize this is a major shift in the power 
structure of Europe. This is a big deal. 
Finland, Sweden—Sweden has been tra-
ditionally neutral—and other European 
countries now see clearly the threat 
posed by Vladimir Putin and his desire 
to recreate the Soviet Socialist Repub-
lic. 
Earlier in the conflict, Putin threat-
ened both Finland and Sweden with 
‘‘grave consequences’’ if they sought to 
join NATO. Does this sound familiar? 
It is the same thing he said about 
Ukraine. 
Remember, Finland shares a border 
with Russia, about 810 miles. To the 
Finns, the threat of Russian troops is

very real, and it is on their border. Fin-
land is not dependent on Russia, as 
some other nations are. In fact, they 
barely get 5 percent of their energy 
from Russia, and they are working to 
even cut that amount down further. 
Good for them. They are not afraid of 
Russia. They would rather see the ben-
efits of a defensive alliance based on 
common, shared democratic values. 
That is what NATO is about. It is not 
offensive; it is defensive. And that is 
what Finland and Sweden both see. 
We should be encouraged by Fin-
land’s 
increased 
military 
spending, 
which they just increased to about 2 
percent of their GDP. That is the 
NATO target of 2 percent. I commend 
Finland for that. They need to set an 
example for other members of the alli-
ance. 
They also just augmented their air 
force, and they are among Europe’s 
most 
effective 
and 
largest 
Armed 
Forces per capita. They are able to mo-
bilize an army of 280,000 troops and 
600,000 
reservists. 
Sweden 
also 
in-
creased its military spending this year 
for the biggest increase in 70 years. 
This is all positive because it puts ac-
tions behind the words and sends the 
message to Russia, to Vladimir Putin, 
that freedom-loving countries are not 
going to stand idly by while allies are 
invaded or intimidated. All we want to 
do is live in peace, but we are not going 
to stand by while this aggression oc-
curs. 
The Senate has a role to play here 
because these two countries, Sweden 
and Finland, will be coming before the 
U.S. Senate to be confirmed as mem-
bers of NATO. We should do so as soon 
as we possibly can. 
In 
addition, 
the 
administration 
should press other countries to approve 
this very quickly. I heard today that 
the Turks may have some concerns 
about it based on other issues. I hope 
no country stands in the way of this. 
This will make NATO a more effective 
fighting 
force. 
It 
would 
augment 
NATO’s ability to be able to be an ef-
fective, again, peaceful, defensive alli-
ance. 
In 
addition, 
the 
administration 
should press the world to approve 
NATO membership for Finland and 
Sweden, a move that would strengthen 
the security structure and posture for 
free nations, free nations around the 
globe. 
I have talked about a variety of sanc-
tions in my remarks over these past 12 
weeks, and I won’t go over all those 
sanctions. There are trading sanctions. 
They are eliminating Russia’s pre-
ferred tax status. There are banking 
sanctions and, of course, energy. 
Europe, unfortunately, is continuing 
to buy Russian gas and oil. They say 
they are going to stop buying Russian 
coal by August. I hope that is true. But 
they now send about $870 million a day 
to Russia. Think about that, $870 mil-
lion a day to help fund the war ma-
chine. One reason Russia’s economy 
hasn’t totally collapsed is because of 
that—because it is still getting a lot of 
receipts for energy not just from China 
and India, which we all know about and 
we regret, but also from the EU coun-
tries that are way too dependent on 
Russia. 
We are not as dependent, so it is easy 
for us to cut off their oil and gas sup-
plies, which we did, to our credit. But 
we need to back up those European na-
tions now with some of our own. We 
have plenty of gas in this country; as 
an example, natural gas that can back 
up what Russia is providing now, and 
we have a loose agreement to do so. We 
had to tighten that agreement and en-
sure we are not sending these mil-
lions—hundreds of millions of dollars 
every day to Vladimir Putin to fund 
his war machine, especially when Rus-
sia not only continues its onslaught on 
Ukrainian defensive combatants but 
also on noncombatants. We need to act. 
What they are doing is committing war 
crimes. We have all seen them. We all 
know that. 
I have called on the International 
Criminal Court, which, by the way, has 
announced an investigation to follow 
in Ukraine’s footsteps and take the 
next step to begin an actual war crimes 
tribunal. We know enough now. We 
continue to hear about this every day. 
And every day we don’t act, the stories 
get worse. I think this could be a deter-
rent if we moved forward more aggres-
sively. 
Six million Ukrainians have been 
forced out of their country. And ac-
cording to UNICEF, thousands of inno-
cent Ukrainians have been killed, in-
cluding hundreds of children. Since 
February 24, Russian troops have en-
gaged in rape and other forms of sexual 
violence across Ukraine. These vic-
tims—Ukrainian women and girls— 
have been cruelly targeted. We have a 
moral obligation to step up here. The 
whole world does. 
I was glad to hear that a court in 
Kyiv began hearings last Friday on a 
case 
against 
Sergeant 
Vadim 
Shishimarin, the first Russian soldier 
to go on trial for alleged war crimes. 
He is accused of shooting and killing a 
62-year-old civilian man in the north-
eastern Ukrainian region of Sumy in 
late February, just a few yards from 
his home. Apparently, this has all been 
recorded. 
But this is just a drop in the bucket. 
Ukraine’s prosecutor has said her office 
is currently investigating more than 
10,000 alleged war crimes by Russian 
forces involving more than 600 sus-
pects. It will take a vast amount of 
time and resources to hold these crimi-
nals to account, and the United States 
should help Ukraine in this regard. 
I am glad that the supplemental 
funding bill before the Senate right 
now includes funding to do just that: 
$400 million to investigate and docu-
ment war crimes and crimes against 
humanity committed by Russian forces 
in Ukraine. My hope is that holding 
these Russians accountable will have 
this strong deterrent effect. 
To 
Russian 
commanders 
and 
to 
Kremlin officials who are backing this 
brutal and unjustified war, the message 
is very simple: The world is watching. 
They are watching you. The world is 
watching for war crimes, and they are 
being recorded. You have a choice: Say 
no to the orders to attack and kill your 
innocent neighbors in Ukraine, your 
neighbors who only want to live in 
peace. 
By the way, there is a special des-
ignation in U.S. law for countries that 
provide support for international ter-
rorism. They are called state sponsors 
of terrorism. In my view, Russia has 
now earned that notorious designation. 
We should vote on that here in the U.S. 
Senate and further isolate Russia from 
the community of nations. 
The 
Republican 
leader, 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL, along with three of our 
other colleagues, went to Kyiv over the 
weekend 
to 
meet 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy. In that meeting, he reports 
that the issue of Russia being des-
ignated as a state sponsor of terrorism 
came up. And he agreed, as the Repub-
lican leader here in the U.S. Senate, 
that we should move forward with that 
legislation. 
Speaker PELOSI has also been to Kyiv 
for the delegation. I am glad they both 
went, and I hope both of them will 
agree on that designation, which is 
something that President Zelenskyy 
has asked for, and also, again, to en-
sure that we not only provide this aid 
package as soon as possible this week 
but we continue to provide whatever 
help is necessary for our allies in 
Ukraine. 
I close tonight with a few thoughts 
on our leadership not abroad, but here 
at home, and not the leadership of the 
U.S. Government, but instead the lead-
ership of the people of America because 
it is not just the U.S. Government that 
is supporting Ukraine in its hour of 
need. 
Since this terrible conflict began, ev-
eryday Americans across the country 
have stepped up to provide much need-
ed 
assistance—humanitarian 
assist-
ance, economic aid. 
The Ukrainian defenders, the refu-
gees, and the first responders are deep-
ly grateful. In March, in Ohio, Gov-
ernor Mike DeWine sent out a request 
for surplus or expired personal protec-
tive gear to provide to Ukrainian terri-
torial defense forces that had asked for 
them. I am proud to say that Ohio an-
swered that call. 
Altogether, more than two dozen law 
enforcement agencies across Ohio have 
donated 2,000 pieces of personal protec-
tive gear, including 71 vest carriers, 45 
helmets, and 1,880 pieces of body 
armor. With the help of the Fund to 
Aid Ukraine, a nonprofit located in 
Parma, OH, this badly needed equip-
ment will soon make its way into the 
hands of brave Ukrainian defenders 
who are fighting for their lives as they 
endure Russia’s brutal onslaught. 
This organization has now given 24 
pallets of supplies and over 7 tons of

medical supplies to Ukraine as well. I 
am grateful to them and for all the law 
enforcement agencies that sacrificed 
their time and resources to organize 
this effort to provide personal protec-
tive gear. 
In addition, MedWish International 
in Cleveland, which is a highly effec-
tive nonprofit I met with last month, 
has partnered with United Ukrainian 
Organizations of Ohio, headed by Marta 
Liscynesky, to provide individual first 
aid kits and other medical equipment 
to Ukrainian first responders, defend-
ers, and civilians. And Cleveland-based 
KOACORE has delivered 17,000 indi-
vidual first aid kits to the frontlines. 
With this donation, Ukrainian first re-
sponders running into the rubble of 
schools, 
apartment 
buildings, 
and 
homes will be able to save more lives. 
When I was on the Polish-Ukrainian 
border in March, I saw Marta, who set 
up United Ukrainian Organizations of 
Ohio, and also another Ohio friend, 
Andy Futey, who is president of the 
Ukrainian World Congress; and I got to 
see them in action delivering these hu-
manitarian supplies to refugees and 
helping to organize the effort. 
I saw how this affected refugees at 
the border. They came up to us with 
tears in their eyes, almost all women 
and children—the men had been left be-
hind to fight—and they pleaded with us 
to continue the help. They pleaded 
with us to, as they said, ‘‘close the 
skies,’’ to stop these bombs—just con-
stant bombardment of their families. 
They talked about how their homes 
had been destroyed, how members of 
their families had been killed or 
maimed, how the unspeakable crimes 
being committed by these Russian sol-
diers were something that many of 
these families had endured. 
We didn’t have all the answers. We 
haven’t closed the skies. But we did 
say, ‘‘The American people are with 
you,’’ and talked about some of these 
incredibly generous Americans who 
have stepped forward. 
As the Russian forces intentionally 
target these Ukrainian civilians to 
spread fear and panic, this display of 
generosity from the people of Ohio and 
the people of every State represented 
here in this body reassures these 
Ukrainians that we have their back, 
that America—not just our American 
Government but America, the people of 
America—care. I am proud of that. I 
am proud of how people have given 
their time and resources to help those 
in need. 
In Cincinnati, my hometown, we or-
ganized a fundraiser last week for what 
is called World Central Kitchen and the 
good work that they are doing all 
throughout Ukraine and in the border 
areas. This fundraiser went to support 
World Central Kitchen’s work and the 
Kharkiv sister city efforts. Cincinnati 
and Kharkiv are sister cities. I was in-
volved in that group a few decades ago, 
and I remember that, at the time, we 
were so proud to be a sister city to 
Kharkiv because it resembled Cin-
cinnati in many ways—a beautiful city 
with a river running through it, like 
the Ohio River runs through Cin-
cinnati. 
Today, Kharkiv has been nearly flat-
tened. It has been nearly totally de-
stroyed. But, as we talked about in this 
map, look at what is happening. They 
are pushing the Russians back from 
Kharkiv. And they will rebuild, and it 
will be beautiful again. 
I saw the good work that World Cen-
tral Kitchen does when I was on the 
Ukrainian-Polish border. Chef Jose An-
dres, here from Washington, DC, and 
his brainchild, World Central Kitchen, 
is doing amazing work. I volunteered 
with a few colleagues, serving food to 
refugees at one of his 60 popup res-
taurants in the border regions. There 
are dozens more in Ukraine itself. 
There is much more to be done to 
help Ukraine get through this, to help 
them defend themselves, to help them 
push back the Russians, to help them 
deal with the humanitarian crisis, to 
help them rebuild, to help them survive 
this brutal Russian onslaught and re-
build their homeland, which they love 
so much. 
And we are inspired to do more, both 
because this is in our national security 
interest—Vladimir Putin’s victory is 
our loss—and because we are inspired 
by the resiliency and fortitude of the 
Ukrainian 
Armed 
Forces 
and 
the 
Ukrainian people. They have truly 
shown the rest of the world what brav-
ery and patriotism is all about. 
I yield the floor.

MORNING BUSINESS 
REMEMBERING JULIANNE ‘‘JULIE’’ 
BECKETT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
want to honor the life and legacy of 
Julianne ‘‘Julie’’ Beckett of Cedar Rap-
ids, IA. Julie was a mother and pas-
sionate 
advocate 
for 
children 
and 
youth with special healthcare needs 
and disabilities. I got to know Julie 
very well over the years as the result 
of her daughter, Katie Beckett, and 
Julie’s passionate advocacy on Federal 
policy work such as Katie Beckett 
waivers, 
Family 
Opportunity 
Act, 
Money Follows-the-Person, Family-to- 
Family Health Information Centers, 
Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids 
Act, Accelerating Access to Kids Care 
Act, and more. 
Julie’s daughter, Katie, was born in 
Cedar Rapids, IA, on March 9, 1978. 
Five months after she was born, Katie 
contracted viral encephalitis followed 
by grand mal seizures. The encephalitis 
caused damage to her central nervous 
system and her respiratory system, and 
she was attached to a ventilator. She 
would be almost 2 years old before she 
could breathe on her own. Under Med-
icaid law at the time, Katie could only 
receive care through Medicaid if she re-
mained in the hospital, even though 
she was able to receive care at home. 
Iowa Congressman Tom Tauke heard of 
Katie’s situation and realized that it 
made no sense to keep a child in the 
hospital who could be at home with her 
family. He worked to convince the 
Reagan administration that the system 
should be changed to allow States to 
provide Medicaid to children receiving 
care in their homes. Ultimately, Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan took up Katie’s 
cause, intervening so that Katie could 
receive treatment at home and still be 
covered under Medicaid. 
In the 1980s, Julie and Katie were 
able to help change national policy 
that became known as ‘‘Katie Beckett 
waivers’’ and, to date, more than a half 
million disabled children have been 
able to receive care in their homes 
with their families rather than being 
forced into hospitals and institutions. 
Katie passed away on May 18, 2012. 
Since then, Julie continued her advo-
cacy. 
Sadly, last Friday, May 13, 2022, Julie 
passed away. As the result of Julie’s 
advocacy, children like Katie are able 
to live a healthy, happy, and inde-
pendent life. Our Nation has lost a pas-
sionate 
advocate 
for 
children 
and 
youth with special healthcare needs 
and disabilities. For more than 40 
years, Julie advocated and organized 
the voices of families of children and 
youth with special healthcare needs 
and disabilities. Julie cofounded Fam-
ily Voices, a national family-led orga-
nization of families and friends of chil-
dren and youth with special healthcare 
needs and disabilities. Julie was instru-
mental in passing the Family Oppor-
tunity Act, which established Family- 
to-Family Health Information Centers 
and created options for families with 
children 
and 
youth 
with 
special 
healthcare needs and disabilities to 
buy into Medicaid while continuing to 
work, among other important provi-
sions. Julie also worked at Child 
Health Specialty Clinics in Iowa for 30 
years and served as a consultant with 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
In 2021, she was honored with the Fam-
ily Voices Legacy Award in recognition 
of her outstanding lifetime contribu-
tions to healthcare policy and services 
that have improved the lives of chil-
dren with special healthcare needs and 
disabilities and their families. Julie 
positively impacted the lives of chil-
dren and youth with special healthcare 
needs and disabilities and their fami-
lies. 
While Julie would often say she was 
‘‘Katie Beckett’s mom,’’ we also knew 
her as a passionate advocate and serv-
ant leader. Julie’s lifelong pursuit to 
improve the lives of children and youth 
with special healthcare needs and dis-
abilities made an impact for the better 
for her community, State, and Nation. 
Godspeed, my friend.

THE TUSKEGEE AIRMAN LIEUTEN-
ANT 
COLONEL 
ROBERT 
J. 
FRIEND MEMORIAL POST OFFICE 
BUILDING AND THE ARTURO L. 
IBLETO POST OFFICE BUILDING 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I rise today to support legislation that 
would rename local post offices in Cali-
fornia to honor the life and legacy of 
two Californians. 
The first bill, led by Congresswoman 
KATIE
PORTER, would designate the 
Northwood Post Office in Irvine, CA, as 
the 
‘‘Tuskegee 
Airman 
Lieutenant 
Colonel Robert J. Friend Memorial 
Post Office Building.’’ 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Friend 
was 
among the 355 pilots who served in the 
all African-American unit known as 
the Tuskegee Airmen during World 
War II. During his military career, 
Lieutenant Colonel Friend fought in 
142 combat missions and served as an 
operations officer for both the 301st 
Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group. 
He received various military awards, 
such as the Distinguished Flying Cross, 
Presidential Unit Citation, and Air 
Medal. In 2007, he was awarded the Con-
gressional Gold Medal, along with the 
rest of the Tuskegee Airmen. 
After retiring from military service, 
Lieutenant Colonel Friend worked on 
the development of missile systems 
and 
space 
station 
components 
in 
Irvine, CA. He continued to participate 
in speaking and educational engage-
ments about his experience with the 
Tuskegee Airmen into his 90s. 
Lieutenant Colonel Friend died in 
2019 in Long Beach, CA, at the age of 
99. He exemplified all that it is to be a 
public servant by devoting his life to 
his country as a member of the 
Tuskegee Airmen and further serving 
his country after his military career 
ended. 
The second bill, led by Congressman 
MIKE THOMPSON, would designate the 
Cotati Post Office in Cotati, CA, as the 
‘‘Arturo L. Ibleto Post Office Build-
ing.’’ 
Arturo L. Ibleto was an Italian-born 
immigrant and resistance fighter in 
World War II before moving to Sonoma 
County. It was there that he met his 
wife, and they built a successful Italian 
restaurant and catering business. For 
nearly 50 years, Art was an institution 
in the Sonoma County food and wine 
community, where he became known as 
the ‘‘Pasta King.’’ 
Additionally, Art lent considerable 
time and resources to local charitable, 
educational, and civic causes that left 
a lasting mark on the community. He 
continued working full time until his 
passing in 2020 at the age of 94. 
It is an honor for me to be able to 
speak on behalf of these two bills to 
honor notable Californians and cele-
brate our rich history. 
Both of these bills passed the House 
with overwhelming bipartisan support, 
including the support of all 53 Members 
of the California House Delegation as 
cosponsors. Both Senator PADILLA and 
I urge our colleagues to support quick 
passage of these bills. 
ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today in recognition of Asian Pa-
cific American Heritage Month. This 
annual recognition offers the oppor-
tunity to celebrate the unique impact 
the Asian American and Pacific Is-
lander community has made and con-
tinues to make in the United States. 
On this heritage month, we reflect on 
the incredible achievements of this mi-
nority 
community 
and 
honor 
the 
unique combination of traditions and 
cultures that create the rich tapestry 
of the Asian American Pacific Islander 
diaspora and experience. We also use 
this time to educate ourselves on the 
nuances of the AAPI identity and bet-
ter understand the challenges this 
community faces. 
In 1977, then-Representative Frank 
Horton of New York introduced a reso-
lution to designate the first 10 days in 
May as AAPI Heritage Week. The 
month of May was appropriate because 
of two key anniversaries that occurred 
in that month. On May 7, 1843, the first 
Japanese immigrants came to the 
United States. 
On May 10, 1869, the first trans-
continental railroad was completed, 
largely due to the backbreaking work 
of Chinese laborers, some of whom lost 
their lives in the construction. 
Congress did not enact Representa-
tive Horton’s initial resolution. The 
following year, however, with the per-
sistent help of then-Representative 
Norman Mineta, Congress enacted a 
new resolution to designate the 7-day 
period beginning on May 4 as Asian 
American Pacific Islander Heritage 
Week. In 1992, Congress authorized the 
entire month of May as AAPI Heritage 
Month, which we now celebrate. 
The presence and influence of the 
AAPI community in the United States 
has been growing steadily since the 
19th century. The 1870 census classified 
approximately 
63,000 
individuals 
as 
Asian. By 1960, when the census al-
lowed respondents to select their race, 
that number grew to 980,000. As of 2019, 
there are 22.4 million AAPI individuals 
in America, 475,000 of whom call Mary-
land home. 
It is important to remember that the 
AAPI community is not a homogenous 
group. It is an incredibly diverse com-
munity, made up of a wide array of cul-
tures spanning many countries and ter-
ritories, 
which 
includes 
over 
50 
ethnicities, over 100 languages, and 
multiple religions. Each subset draws 
from a unique set of traditions, and we 
cannot assume they have one shared, 
uniform experience. We know that the 
AAPI community makes up about 7 
percent of our total population, and 
this rich and diverse community has an 
outsized impact on every pillar of our 
society. We cannot forget the many 
barriers to success this community has 
overcome to reach such heights, which 
makes this community’s successes all 
the more impressive. 
To understand the profound influence 
the AAPI community has, we need not 
look further than Capitol Hill. This 
year, we mourned the passing of my 
good friend and former colleague, Nor-
man Mineta. A passionate defender of 
justice, talented strategist, and exem-
plary patriot, Representative Mineta 
dedicated his life to service as a mayor, 
Congressman, and Cabinet member. In 
1941, the U.S. Government interned his 
family along with hundreds of thou-
sands of other Japanese Americans. 
Perhaps both in spite of and because of 
that experience, Representative Mineta 
pursued a career as a public servant. 
During his tenure as a legislator, he co-
founded and chaired the Congressional 
Asian Pacific American Caucus. 
He led the charge on the Civil Lib-
erties Act of 1988, which directed the 
Federal Government to issue a formal 
apology to and compensate the sur-
vivors of Japanese internment. He in-
spired generations of Asian Americans 
to get involved in politics. We miss 
him, but his legacy will live on for 
years to come. 
As chairman of the Senate Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship Com-
mittee, I am in awe of the resilience 
and determination we have seen from 
AAPI small business owners over the 
past 2 years. In Maryland alone, there 
are 
13,375 
AAPI-owned 
businesses, 
many of which include restaurants and 
eateries. In fact, if you use cuisine pre-
dominance as a barometer of cultural 
impact, the Asian American influence 
is unparalleled. 
In 2021, the New York Times pub-
lished a list of the 50 most exciting res-
taurants in the United States. Seven-
teen of the top 50 restaurants, or 34 
percent, incorporate AAPI food or have 
an AAPI head chef, more than any 
other foreign cuisine. Through food, 
AAPI culture has become inextricably 
linked to the American identity. In my 
home city of Baltimore, a group of vol-
unteers known as the China Collective 
organizes a pop-up market named the 
Charm City Market. I have watched as 
the event has grown in both attendance 
and footprint over the years, cele-
brating the AAPI community’s diverse 
food and entrepreneurship landscape. 
Each year, I look forward to the mar-
ket’s ever-growing celebration and em-
powerment of AAPI small business 
owners and entrepreneurs. 
Asian American Pacific Islanders 
also played a massive role in our 
COVID–19 response, oftentimes finding 
themselves on the front lines as essen-
tial workers. Despite facing racial bias 
and prejudice largely attributed to 
Donald Trump’s deliberately inflam-
matory use of the term ‘‘China Virus,’’ 
the 
AAPI 
community 
remained 
a 
steadfast lifeline for Americans in 
need. At Johns Hopkins Hospital in 
Baltimore, Erika Rono, an emergency 
room nurse who came to the U.S. from 
the Philippines in 2014, continues to 
work every day through the harrowing 
realities of a hospital overrun by 
COVID–19 patients. Over the past 2 
years, she has toiled day and night, 
putting her own life at risk, to save

Baltimoreans. We cannot thank her 
and her colleagues enough for their 
bravery. 
Despite the vital role the AAPI com-
munity plays in the U.S., they still en-
dure racism and discrimination. I am 
broken-hearted to see an unprece-
dented increase in hate crimes against 
the AAPI community in recent years. 
According to a study by the Center for 
the Study of Hate and Extremism at 
California State University in San 
Bernardino, there was a 44-percent in-
crease in anti-Asian American hate 
crimes across 16 of the largest cities in 
the United States. In 2021, 81 percent of 
Asian Americans who participated in a 
report by Pew Research stated that vi-
olence against them was increasing. 
One in 4 AAPI small business owners 
has experienced vandalism or threats 
to their business at least once between 
2020 and 2021, and one in five Asian 
Americans worries daily about poten-
tial racial threats and attacks. On top 
of this fear of retaliation, there is also 
concern in the community, as with ev-
eryone else, about contracting the 
virus. 
We must continue to do all that we 
can to preserve, protect, and support 
the AAPI community. Last year, Con-
gress enacted and President Biden 
signed into law S. 937, the ‘‘COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act,’’ which formally con-
demns anti-Asian violence and creates 
pathways for the expedited reporting 
and prosecution of such abhorrent 
events at the Federal, State, and local 
levels. There is no place for hate in our 
society. 
Today, as I think about my late, 
great colleague Norm Mineta and all 
the Asian Americans who make Amer-
ica what it is today, I re-emphasize my 
gratitude for the AAPI community and 
reaffirm my commitment to elimi-
nating systemic barriers to its success.

TRIBUTE TO MICHELE MACKIN 
Mr. REED. Madam President, today I 
wish to recognize the dedicated public 
service of Michele Mackin, who retired 
on April 30 as managing director for 
contracting and national security ac-
quisitions with the Government Ac-
countability Office. 
For 34 years, Michele has helped Con-
gress analyze the Federal Govern-
ment’s largest acquisition programs, 
from the Air Force’s C–17 and C–130 air-
craft to the Navy’s Littoral Combat 
Ship, Ford-class aircraft carrier, and 
Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, along 
with scores of other systems and re-
lated services that the Departments of 
Defense and Homeland Security have 
procured to make our Nation safe. 
She has also been a leading voice on 
Federal contracting issues and a vigi-
lant 
watchdog 
who 
consistently 
brought important issues related to the 
improper use of contracts to light. In 
so doing, Michele has obtained the re-
spect of the Members of this body and 
the deep affection of her colleagues, 
who for decades have been drawn to her 
fine example of public service. 
Michele has been a trusted voice on 
this Nation’s shipbuilding programs, 
and Congress has relied greatly on her 
clear analysis and recommendations to 
guide us in our oversight role. Since 
first becoming a member of the Senior 
Executive Service in 2013, Michele has 
testified before Congress 11 times for a 
variety of committees—voicing con-
cern on the Littoral Combat Ship pro-
gram, raising questions about the 
Navy’s acquisition strategy for the 
Constellation-class guided-missile frig-
ate, highlighting risks in the Coast 
Guard’s Deepwater program, and advo-
cating for contracting and acquisition 
reforms at the Departments of Navy, 
Homeland Security, and Veterans Af-
fairs. 
Michele epitomizes what Congress 
and the American public value about 
the Government Accountability Office: 
the honest broker. In embracing the 
idea that oversight of programs and 
contracts represents a sacred trust, 
Michele has been a tireless, effective 
advocate for both the American tax-
payer and the men and women serving 
the government’s many and varied mis-
sions. She has inspired her teams with 
the notion of stewardship that the 
American people should get what they 
have paid for, that government should 
operate fairly and transparently, and 
American warfighters should get the 
capabilities they need to defend this 
great Nation. 
We wish Michele a fond farewell and 
thank her for her distinguished service 
to Congress and the American public.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DR. ETHELDRA 
‘‘THEL’’ SAMPSON DAVIS 
∑ Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I rise today to bring the Senate’s at-
tention to the life and legacy of an 
Alaskan trailblazer, a woman of enor-
mous heart and energy whose dedica-
tion to the young people of Anchorage, 
AK, was deep and made a positive dif-
ference. 
Etheldra ‘‘Thel’’ Sampson Davis was 
born in Arkansas in 1931, one of eight 
children. After her family moved to 
California while she was a child, she 
graduated from LA City College with 
an associate of arts degree in 1951 and 
subsequently earned a bachelor’s de-
gree in education from the University 
of California, Los Angeles. She prac-
ticed her profession in the Watts neigh-
borhood of Los Angeles for 8 years. 
In 1957, Thel visited her adventurous 
older brothers in Anchorage, AK, and 
fell in love with the State. After be-
coming certified to teach in Alaska, 
she became the first African-American 
on-contract teacher in the Anchorage 
School District in 1959. As a teacher, 
she contributed to the future of the 
Anchorage community at five Anchor-
age elementary schools: Willow Crest, 
Airport 
Heights, 
Government 
Hill, 
Mountain View, and Denali. And in 
1965, she earned her master’s in edu-
cation degree from the University of 
Alaska Fairbanks. 
In 1967, she became the assistant 
principal at Willow Crest Elementary 
School. And in 1969—the same year in 
which she married Joseph Davis—she 
applied for and was hired to fill the po-
sition of principal at Fairview Elemen-
tary School. This was yet another 
trailblazing moment for Thel, as she 
was the first African-American prin-
cipal in Anchorage. She later became 
principal at the new Ptarmigan Ele-
mentary and later the John F. Kennedy 
Elementary School on Fort Richardson 
near Anchorage. Always seeking addi-
tional 
knowledge 
and 
skill, 
Thel 
achieved yet another goal by earning 
her doctorate in education from Cali-
fornia’s Newport University in 1975. 
Thel taught and provided leadership 
for Anchorage area students and her 
fellow educators for 21 years until her 
retirement in 1980. A former super-
intendent of the Anchorage School Dis-
trict 
has 
said 
of 
Thel’s 
service, 
‘‘Etheldra had a true passion and belief 
that ALL students can succeed if given 
a rigorous academic program coupled 
with love and concern.’’ The Anchorage 
School Board, in reviewing the pro-
posal to rename Fairview Elementary 
School in her honor, noted that her 
‘‘passion and commitment to the stu-
dents entrusted to her care is leg-
endary.’’ No better tribute can ever be 
said of an educator. 
But throughout her career, Thel was 
not only a busy teacher and principal. 
In addition to her school-based con-
tributions to the Anchorage commu-
nity, Thel was an active member in a 
variety of community and national or-
ganizations, including the Alpha Kappa 
Alpha Sorority and National Education 
Association. She also helped to estab-
lish several youth mentoring organiza-
tions, including the NAACP Youth 
Council and the United League of Girls. 
As a member of the Black Educators 
Taskforce, she helped to recruit and 
mentor African-American teachers and 
administrators 
for 
Anchorage’s 
schools. 
After her retirement, Thel continued 
to contribute through her role as a 
crime prevention specialist. Her work 
in that area resulted in the creation of 
the Neighborhood Watch program in 
Anchorage and the Alaska Coalition to 
Prevent Shoplifting. 
Thel continues to lift students up. 
Her lifelong dream came true with the 
creation of the Dr. Etheldra S. Davis 
Scholarship in 2019, which is dedicated 
to helping young people continue their 
education through whatever path is 
best for them, be it through the trades 
and apprenticeship or college. 
Thel ‘‘gained her heavenly wings’’ at 
the age of 85 on November 25, 2020, due 
to complications from COVID–19. 
In recognition of the many contribu-
tions Dr. Davis made to Anchorage’s 
youth and the community at large over 
her many years of service, the Anchor-
age School Board recently voted to re-
name the first school in which she

May 17, 2022 
served as principal in her honor. Hence-
forth, this school will be known as Dr. 
Etheldra Davis Fairview Elementary 
School. It has been said that seeing 
Thel’s name above the school doorway 
will ‘‘serve as a beacon for generations 
of children to come in our neighbor-
hood to show them, in a very diverse 
neighborhood, what they can accom-
plish if they apply themselves and they 
work hard.’’ 
I think we all understand how impor-
tant it is for children to see adults who 
look like them and who share cultural 
history and perspectives as leaders in 
their lives. I can only imagine how 
powerful it must have been for Anchor-
age’s African-American students to see 
an African-American teacher and prin-
cipal serving them and their school, es-
pecially during the culturally fraught 
era of the 1950s and 1960s. I know that 
the children who attend Dr. Etheldra 
Davis Fairview Elementary School will 
continue to be inspired by her example 
for many years to come. 
I am proud to have known Thel and 
am proud today to come to the floor of 
the U.S. Senate to honor her and her 
many contributions to the community 
of Anchorage, AK, and, indeed, the en-
tire State and Nation.∑

REMEMBERING MARK SWEENEY 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
would like to share a few words today 
to honor an outstanding leader and 
friend of mine who recently passed 
away. 
Mark Sweeney was a State senator 
for Montana’s 39th District and a can-
didate for the U.S. House of Represent-
atives. Mark was the face of public 
service in Montana, with an unyielding 
commitment to make our State better 
for all of our kids and grandkids. 
Born in Butte, raised in Miles City, 
and a longtime resident of Anaconda, 
Mark was a Montanan through and 
through. Mark worked for Montana 
Fish, Wildlife, and Parks for 32 years 
until he retired as a fisheries manager. 
He started his political career as a 
commissioner in Anaconda-Deer Lodge 
and later successfully ran for a seat in 
Montana’s State Legislature as a rep-
resentative. He was elected to the 
State senate in 2020. 
During his career, Mark was a tire-
less advocate for public lands and pub-
lic access, working with sportsmen and 
women around Montana to protect our 
greatest treasures for future genera-
tions. When Mark talked about run-
ning for office, he focused on how he 
would improve the lives of his fellow 
citizens, and he worked with anyone 
and everyone, regardless of whether 
they agreed or disagreed with him. 
Mark was a fierce advocate for work-
ing families across Montana. He be-
lieved in the power of public education 
to lift folks up and prioritized the cre-
ation of good-paying jobs, especially 
for young people, that would keep 
them living and working in Montana. 
Mark was an effective policy-maker 
who made it a priority to balance con-
servation and responsible development 
in our communities. Mark’s lifelong 
commitment to bettering our State 
and preserving our public lands for gen-
erations wasn’t something he preached; 
it was something he lived every day. 
I want to express my deepest sym-
pathy to Mark’s wife, Sue, his children, 
Shannon 
and 
Jordan, 
stepchildren, 
Carly and Brandi Johnson, and grand-
children, Wes and Brooks, as well as 
the rest of the Sweeney family. Those 
who knew Mark will remember him as 
not only a dedicated public servant, 
but as a family man and a dear friend. 
His friendly demeanor and sense of 
humor will be sorely missed. 
Mark has left a lasting legacy on us 
all, but especially his family and 
friends, his colleagues in the State leg-
islature, and those he represented in 
the State of Montana. He will not be 
forgotten.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. KELLY, and Ms. SINEMA): 
S. 4231. A bill to support water infra-
structure in Reclamation States, and 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak about the STREAM 
Act (Support to Rehydrate the Envi-
ronment, Agriculture and Municipali-
ties Act), which I am introducing today 
alongside 
my 
cosponsors 
Senators 
MARK
KELLY
and KYRSTEN
SINEMA. 
This is a bill intended to address the 
massive drought affecting much of the 
Western United States. 
As the past 2 years demonstrate all 
too painfully, drought exacerbated by 
climate 
change—increasingly 
severe 
and prolonged drought—is a stark re-
ality for California and the West. 
This has resulted in shortages of 
water for agriculture, for irrigation, 
and increasingly threatens residential 
and business uses. The drought has 
threatened endangered species and re-
sults in a drying of the ground and 
plantlife that makes wildfire an even 
greater threat. 
If we don’t take action now, it is only 
going to get worse. Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory scientists project 
that climate change will cause a 54- 
percent drop in the Sierras’ snowpack 
within the next 20 to 40 years and a 79- 
percent drop by the end of the century. 
This change alone could be devastating 
for California, because we absolutely 
depend on this snowpack. The Sierra 
snowpack provides 30 percent of our 
water supply and is our biggest res-
ervoir. 
For these reasons and others we need 
an ‘‘all of the above’’ water strategy, 
including No. 1, increased water sup-
ply; No. 2, incentivizing projects that 
build in environmental benefits and 
drinking water for disadvantaged com-
munities, and No. 3, investing in sepa-
rate environmental restoration efforts. 
The bill I am introducing today helps 
meet this challenge in four funda-
mental ways: 
No. 1, it authorizes significant water 
supply funding that, in combination 
with the bipartisan infrastructure law, 
would provide California with 1.04 mil-
lion additional acre-feet of water per 
year on average, enough water for over 
6 million people; 
No. 2, it provides additional financial 
incentives for water supply projects 
that include environmental benefits 
and drinking water for disadvantaged 
communities; 
No. 3, it reforms the Congressional 
review process to more quickly approve 
water supply projects, and a new loan 
program combined with grants to more 
cost-effectively fund new non-Federal 
water supply projects; and 
No. 4, it significantly invests not 
only in water supply projects but also 
in environmental restoration to help 
imperiled species adapt to climate 
change as well. 
To demonstrate why this bill is so 
desperately needed, let me illustrate 
the extent and damage caused by the 
current drought in the West. 
A precursor of the even more pro-
longed dry spells coming with climate 
change, 
California’s 
2020 
to 
2022 
drought has had severe impacts on 
farms, cities, and the environment. 
In 2021, the drought caused the Cali-
fornia agriculture industry to shrink 
by an estimated 8,745 jobs and incur 
$1.2 billion in direct costs, according to 
a report prepared for the California De-
partment of Food and Agriculture by 
researchers at the University of Cali-
fornia at Merced. In addition, reduced 
water deliveries resulted in 395,000 
acres 
of 
cropland 
left 
dry 
and 
unplanted. 
Counting ‘‘spillover effects’’ in the 
broader economy, the U.C. Merced 
analysis found the total impacts were 
more than 14,600 lost jobs, both full 
time and part time, and $1.7 billion in 
gross revenue losses. 
In both 2021 and 2022, homes in sig-
nificant parts of the State have been at 
risk of running dry. Last year, large 
parts of Marin and Sonoma Counties 
and the Mendocino coast came very 
close to losing all water supply. This 
year, much of Los Angeles, Ventura, 
and San Bernardino Counties have been 
placed under emergency orders lim-
iting them to once a week landscape ir-
rigation, with the possibility of a com-
plete irrigation shutoff by fall.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2546 
May 17, 2022 
In California, one in eight acres 
statewide has burned from wildfires in 
the last decade, with the past 2 years 
being the worst on record. With 95 per-
cent of the State experiencing drought 
as we enter into the traditional wild-
fire season, we are poised for an even 
worse year this year. 
The drought has been devastating to 
the aquatic ecosystem as well as our 
forests. As just one example, the en-
dangered winter-run Chinook salmon 
depend on sufficient cold water re-
leased by Shasta Dam to rear juveniles 
in the Sacramento River. 
With limited water available in 2021, 
NOAA Fisheries models predict that 
approximately 75 percent of the winter 
run chinook salmon’s eggs died from 
elevated water temperatures. This is a 
species with three 1-year age classes, 
and a prolonged drought could threaten 
the survival of the species. 
In order to increase drought resil-
iency in California and other Western 
States, the bill authorizes the fol-
lowing funding over the next 5 years: 
$750 million for surface and ground-
water storage projects, and supporting 
conveyance, including $50 million for 
natural water retention and release 
projects; $300 million for water recy-
cling projects; $150 million for desali-
nation projects; $250 million for envi-
ronmental restoration projects; $100 
million for drinking water for dis-
advantaged communities; and $150 mil-
lion for low-interest loans for water 
supply projects. 
This funding builds on the bipartisan 
infrastructure law’s funding of $1.15 
billion for storage projects, $550 mil-
lion for water recycling projects, and 
$250 million for desalination projects. 
The STREAM Act, in combination 
with the bipartisan infrastructure law, 
would provide California with the Fed-
eral 
cost-share 
for 
approximately 
1,042,000 acre-feet per year of additional 
water supply, or enough water for over 
6 million people. This comes from the 
following: 
Enough funding for California to fi-
nally build three major off-stream 
storage projects providing 370,000 acre- 
feet of water on average each year: 
Sites Reservoir, the Los Vaqueros Ex-
pansion, and the BF Sisk raise. In addi-
tion, the storage funding could provide 
an additional 55,000 acre-feet per year 
from some combination of other small-
er surface and groundwater storage 
projects like the Sacramento Regional 
Groundwater Bank or Del Puerto Can-
yon Reservoir. All of the projects are 
non-Federal projects with a 25 percent 
Federal cost share, with the exception 
of the Federal BF Sisk Raise with a 50 
percent Federal cost-share. 
Enough funding for 532,000 additional 
acre-feet 
from 
water 
recycling 
projects, from the $300 million author-
ized in the bill plus $550 million in the 
bipartisan infrastructure legislation, 
with a 25 percent Federal cost-share for 
projects. 
Enough funding for approximately 
85,000 additional acre-feet from the $150 
million authorized in the bill for de-
salination projects, plus $250 million in 
the bipartisan infrastructure legisla-
tion, with a 25 percent Federal cost- 
share for projects. 
While virtually everyone supports 
water recycling projects, surface and 
groundwater storage projects are some-
times more controversial. I want to 
point out a report just released today 
by the widely respected Public Policy 
Institute of California, PPIC, which re-
lates to the benefits of additional sur-
face and groundwater storage as Cali-
fornia’s climate is changing. 
Many climate forecasters emphasize 
that as climate change intensifies, 
California will get more of its precipi-
tation in a few large to extraordinarily 
large storms fueled by atmospheric riv-
ers, and more of the precipitation will 
fall as rain rather than snow. In be-
tween the bursts of atmospheric rivers, 
there will be longer and more intense 
droughts. We have definitely seen a 
preview of this pattern this year. 
PPIC has studied these projections 
and estimated that there is substantial 
water in wet years that is not needed 
to maintain healthy Delta outflows but 
currently cannot be captured because 
California lacks the infrastructure to 
store for future dry periods. PPIC sug-
gests that given this reality, cost-effec-
tive storage projects in appropriate lo-
cations could help improve California’s 
drought resiliency. 
PPIC also argues that these storage 
projects should be managed for envi-
ronmental flow benefits as well as 
water supply benefits. This bill would 
help with that because Federal funding 
for Sites Reservoir would help provide 
cold water for salmon, and Federal 
funding for the expansion of Los 
Vaqueros 
Reservoir 
would 
provide 
needed water for wildlife refuges. Re-
garding cold water reserves for salmon 
in particular, these reserves will be 
critical to prevent salmon runs from 
being wiped out during the potential 
fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh years of 
devastating droughts. 
The 
bill’s 
funding 
authorizations 
apply 
not 
just 
to 
California 
but 
throughout 
the 
17 
Western 
States 
where the Bureau of Reclamation has a 
presence. Many of these States have re-
cently benefited from the Bureau of 
Reclamation’s 
storage, 
water 
recy-
cling, and desalination programs and/or 
have projects currently seeking fund-
ing from these programs, including Ar-
izona, 
Idaho, 
Washington, 
Oregon, 
Texas, Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico. 
I believe the Federal funding assist-
ance authorized by this bill will be par-
ticularly important for all seven Colo-
rado River basin States as the States 
negotiate the next painful round of 
water supply cuts from the Colorado 
River between now and 2026 in order to 
meet the challenge of an increasingly 
dry Colorado River basin. 
In Arizona, the STREAM Act would 
significantly advance the Salt River 
Project’s proposal to raise Bartlett 
Dam on the Verde River to counteract 
the loss of approximately one-third of 
the nearby Horseshoe Dam’s capacity 
from 
accumulating 
sediment. 
The 
Bartlett Dam raise would provide an 
additional 60,000 to 115,000 acre-feet per 
year or enough water for 360,000 to 
690,000 people. 
The bill uses financial incentives to 
encourage 
storage 
and 
conveyance 
projects to include environmental ben-
efits and other public benefits such as 
drinking water for disadvantaged com-
munities. This is important to ensure 
that the environment and disadvan-
taged communities are included in our 
drought resilience strategies. 
The bill authorizes low-interest loans 
for sponsors of storage and conveyance 
projects if those projects solely provide 
irrigation and general municipal and 
industrial water supply benefits. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
bill 
authorizes 
grants for storage and conveyance 
projects that include environmental 
benefits, drinking water benefits for 
disadvantaged communities, or other 
public benefits either as part of the 
project design or as part of a watershed 
restoration plan adopted together with 
the project. 
This access to grants gives project 
sponsors a strong financial incentive to 
design environmental and disadvan-
taged community benefits into their 
projects. This approach builds on the 
experience of the Proposition 1 water 
bond California’s voters passed by a 2- 
to-1 
margin 
in 
2014, 
which 
also 
incentivizes 
projects 
with 
environ-
mental and other public benefits. 
If storage and conveyance projects 
take these steps, they can get Federal 
grants both directly for the public ben-
efits and for an equal value investment 
in the water supply component of the 
project. Thus, the Federal Government 
will provide $50 million for the general 
water supply benefits of a project if the 
project also has $50 million in fish and 
wildlife or water quality benefits ei-
ther directly from the project or from 
an associated watershed restoration 
plan. 
The bill not only increases funding 
for drought resiliency projects, it expe-
dites their approvals and assists them 
more cost-effectively, stretching tax-
payer dollars further. 
The traditional Bureau of Reclama-
tion model for approving and funding 
new water supply projects has involved 
the following: 
No. 
1, 
reclamation 
studies 
new 
projects in detail, which can take a 
decade or more for major projects; 
No. 2, once Reclamation’s studies are 
complete, Congress authorizes projects 
individually, which can take another 3– 
5 years or longer in many cases; and 
No. 3, the design and construction 
can take a decade or longer. 
One can quickly see that this model 
can end up taking decades to construct 
significant new water supply projects. 
This is especially the case given the 
limitations of Federal budgets and the 
increasing cost of major protein recent 
years. Given the tremendous challenge

May 17, 2022 
posed by climate change to western 
water supply, we need a nimbler and 
more responsive model. 
Mike Connor, the Deputy Secretary 
of the Interior during the Obama Ad-
ministration and currently Assistant 
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, 
testified in support of a new model dur-
ing an October 8, 2015, hearing before 
the Senate Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources. Deputy Secretary 
Connor stated: 
The 
traditional 
Reclamation 
business 
model, in which feasibility studies, con-
sistent with the 1983 Principles and Guide-
lines for Water and Related Resources Devel-
opment, are first authorized, funded, and 
submitted to Congress, and then construc-
tion is authorized and funded, does not al-
ways address the needs of project sponsors at 
the state and local levels. Moreover, given 
budget limitations and the availability of 
other available financing mechanisms, the 
historic federal role in financing water stor-
age projects through the Bureau of Reclama-
tion must be revisited with a greater empha-
sis on non-federal financing. 
In response to the concerns articu-
lated by then-Deputy Secretary Connor 
and others, the bill we are introducing 
today, building on the 2016 Water Infra-
structure Improvements for the Nation 
Act, makes five significant changes to 
the 
traditional 
reclamation 
model. 
These changes expedite project approv-
als and make more cost-effective use of 
available federal funding. 
No. 1, Congressional authorization no 
longer 
required 
for 
non-Federal 
projects. 
First, the bill eliminates the need for 
Congress to authorize individual water 
recycling and desalination projects and 
non-Federal storage projects with a 
Federal investment of less than $250 
million. It can take 3 to 5 years or 
longer for projects to get legislatively 
approved. In fact, zero new water recy-
cling projects were authorized from 
2009 to 2017 despite dozens of meri-
torious projects with approved feasi-
bility studies. 
Federal storage projects, which are 
often more controversial, continue to 
require congressional authorization, as 
do non-Federal storage projects with a 
greater than $250 million Federal in-
vestment. 
The 
bill 
shortens 
the 
timeline for congressional approval of 
these projects through directing Rec-
lamation to follow a process that the 
Army Corps of Engineers uses to notify 
Congress of completed feasibility stud-
ies each year to set up an orderly 
timeline to authorize projects. 
No. 2, non-Federal funding is required 
up front. 
Second, the bill no longer requires 
100 percent Federal funding up front as 
was necessary under the traditional 
Reclamation model. Instead, the bill 
allows a maximum of 50 percent Fed-
eral 
funding 
for 
federally 
owned 
projects and a maximum of 25 percent 
Federal 
funding 
for 
non-Federal 
projects that are built by States, water 
districts, or Indian Tribes. 
Federal dollars can be stretched fur-
ther by the partnerships with States 
and water districts that will be fos-
tered under the bill. For example, the 
proposed expansion of Los Vaqueros 
Reservoir in California would be funded 
nearly 50 percent by the State of Cali-
fornia, which has already conditionally 
awarded funding, in addition to poten-
tially 20 to 25 percent by the Federal 
Government and the remaining 25 to 30 
percent by water users. 
Multipartner projects like the Los 
Vaqueros expansion frequently have 
multiple benefits. For example, much 
of the State and Federal funding for 
the Los Vaqueros expansion would go 
to augment the water supply of wildlife 
refuges that provide essential water for 
migratory birds on the Pacific flyway. 
These benefits would complement the 
project’s water supply benefits for 
many Bay Area water districts. 
No. 3, the new loan program is cost- 
effective. 
Third, the low-interest loan program 
created by the bill for water supply 
projects is an exceptionally cost-effec-
tive program. This program, known as 
the Reclamation Infrastructure Fi-
nance and Innovation Act, RIFIA, 
would use existing criteria for loans 
under the successful WIFIA Program, 
the Water Infrastructure. Finance and 
Innovation Act. 
The Office of Management and the 
Budget, OMB, has approved loans of 
$2.3 billion for WIFIA in fiscal year 2018 
backed by appropriations of just over 1 
percent of that amount, or $25 million 
in budget authority. OMB was able to 
approve loans backed by just l percent 
of the loan amount because there is a 
virtually non existent default rate for 
water projects. Only 4 in 1,000 water in-
frastructure projects default, based on 
a study conducted by the Fitch credit 
rating agency. 
Given OMB’s experience that Federal 
outlays need only cover l percent of the 
loan cost for water projects, the $125 
million in authorized. Federal spending 
in the draft bill likely could support 
$12.5 billion in water project lending 
authority. 
Federal funding of 1 percent of the 
loan amount will typically return 10 to 
25 percent savings in the repayment 
cost of the loans for the water districts 
funding the projects. The total savings 
can be about 10 percent for AAA-rated 
districts and 20 to 25 percent for AA- 
rated districts. 
For example, the water users who are 
supporting the proposed Sites Res-
ervoir in northern California have esti-
mated that the loans authorized by 
this bill would allow them to pay only 
$512/acre-foot for water delivered by 
the project instead of $682/acre-foot, or 
a 25 percent reduction in their costs. 
Thus, the Federal Government can 
provide a loan at 1 percent of the loan 
amount and save the project sponsors 
10 to 25 percent of the project cost. 
That is an exceptionally cost-effective 
Federal investment. 
There are at least three significant 
reasons that the loans are so beneficial 
for the project sponsors: 
The sponsors pay a substantially 
lower interest rate on their loans than 
they would under the alternative of 
municipal bond financing. 
The districts would not need to start 
loan repayments until 5 years after 
substantial completion of the project, a 
substantial cost saver. 
Loans are for 35 rather than 30 years, 
lowering annual debt service costs. 
Significantly, the loans include all 
the taxpayer protections from the suc-
cessful WIFIA and TIFIA, Transpor-
tation Infrastructure Finance and In-
novation Act, programs. In particular, 
the RIFIA loans would be limited to 49 
percent of the project costs, and the 
Federal loans would have senior status 
in the event of any default. These pro-
visions ensure the taxpayer won’t be 
harmed in any default where the 
project retains at least 50 percent of its 
value, which is extremely likely for 
ratepayer 
backed 
water 
supply 
projects. 
No. 4, Federal grants and loans work 
together. 
Fourth, the combination of low-in-
terest loans and Federal grants of up to 
25 percent of project costs for non-Fed-
eral projects can allow water users to 
make up the difference where the Fed-
eral Government is no longer funding 
l00 percent of project costs up front. 
Many rural communities, and in par-
ticular agricultural communities, are 
not able to pay 100 percent of the cost 
of new water supply projects. 
Under the bill I am introducing 
today, these communities will still 
have to provide a significant cost-share 
for improving their water supplies, and 
new water projects will have to be cost- 
effective enough to justify that invest-
ment. However, the Federal—Govern-
ment can help build the best and most 
effective projects in increasing drought 
resiliency 
by 
providing 
assistance 
through both grants and loans. 
Finally, the longer and more severe 
droughts coming with climate change 
will adversely affect not just farms and 
cities but also the natural environ-
ment. The bill includes provisions to 
improve species’ drought resiliency as 
well. 
The significant funding authorization 
of $250 million for environmental res-
toration can be used to benefit many 
different species, including fish and mi-
gratory birds. Some authorized uses of 
this funding include: improved habitat 
for salmon, Delta smelt and other fish 
species adversely affected by the Bu-
reau of Reclamation’s water projects; 
additional water for wildlife refuges 
hosting migratory birds along the Pa-
cific flyway; improved stream gauges, 
monitoring, and science to better un-
derstand how to restore species and to 
operate Reclamation water projects 
with reduced environmental impacts; 
ensuring that when Sacramento Valley 
rice growers sell their water and idle 
their crops, some water is left behind 
and applied to bare fields in late sum-
mer and early fall to create shallow 
flooded 
habitat 
during 
a 
critical

shorebird migration period; and assist-
ance in implementing water-related 
settlements with State agencies and 
State water quality laws. 
The bill would also authorize $50 mil-
lion of the broader storage funding for 
natural water retention and release 
projects. 
These projects would help restore 
stream and river channels with natural 
materials like wetlands. Like many 
other projects prioritized by the bill, 
these projects could have multiple ben-
efits, including increased groundwater 
recharge, improved flood protection, 
and increased floodplain habitat to 
benefit salmon and other species. I 
look forward to receiving comments on 
ways to prioritize multibenefit projects 
like natural water storage projects as 
we move forward with the bill. 
The bill also authorizes pay-for-per-
formance 
environmental 
restoration 
approaches that award grants contin-
gent on the success of the restoration 
effort. These approaches can expedite 
environmental restoration and build 
public/private partnerships to increase 
the number of acres restored. 
In addition, the bill makes clear that 
it must be implemented consistently 
with all Federal environmental laws, 
including the Endangered Species Act, 
the National Environmental Policy 
Act, the Clean Water Act, and all other 
environmental 
laws. 
All 
applicable 
State laws must also be followed. 
California is home to more than 40 
million people, but our major state-
wide water infrastructure hasn’t sig-
nificantly changed in the past 50 years, 
when we had only 16 million people. 
We must modernize the system or we 
risk becoming a desert State. Criti-
cally, this means putting in place in-
frastructure to allow our cities, our 
farmers, and our natural communities 
to withstand the severe droughts that 
we are projected to face as a result of 
climate change. 
I hope my western colleagues will 
join my cosponsors and me on this bill 
because drought is a serious threat for 
all of our States.

lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 637 
Whereas women constitute 50.8 percent of 
United States citizens and nearly 1⁄2 of the 
workforce in the United States; 
Whereas women control 60 percent of per-
sonal wealth and are responsible for 85 per-
cent of consumer spending and 80 percent of 
health care decisions; 
Whereas, across races, ethnicities, socio-
economic statuses, disability statuses, and 
age groups— 
(1) women experience many diseases and 
disorders differently than men; 
(2) 
the 
incidence, 
prevalence, 
symptomology, and severity of disease may 
differ between men and women; 
(3) women vary in the risks of certain dis-
eases and the benefits of medical therapies; 
and 
(4) for many years, women were underrep-
resented in biomedical and clinical research; 
Whereas longer life spans of women require 
the need for research on the health of older 
women; 
Whereas women and men have funda-
mental biological differences at the cellular 
level; 
Whereas 2⁄3 of patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease are women; 
Whereas heart disease is the leading cause 
of death in women, and women are 50 percent 
more likely to die the year following a heart 
attack than men; 
Whereas 80 percent of patients with auto-
immune diseases are women; 
Whereas women have more stroke events 
and are less likely to recover from such 
events than men; 
Whereas there are significant sex and age 
differences between men and women with re-
spect to drug administration and dosage; 
Whereas older women are more prone to 
having multiple medical problems and, as a 
result, may be taking incorrectly prescribed 
medications due to lack of information on 
gender and age differences; 
Whereas, on January 25, 2016, the National 
Institutes of Health implemented a policy 
requiring federally funded investigators to 
consider sex as a biological variable in pre-
clinical research; 
Whereas 
such 
policy 
has 
improved 
inclusivity in women’s health research, but 
disparities still remain; 
Whereas the 2021 report entitled ‘‘The Case 
to Fund Women’s Health Research: An Eco-
nomic and Societal Impact Analysis’’, pub-
lished by Women’s Health Access Matters 
(commonly known as the ‘‘WHAM Report’’), 
states that in 2019, of the funding provided 
by the National Institutes of Health, 12 per-
cent of the funding for Alzheimer’s research, 
4.5 percent of the funding for coronary artery 
disease research, and 7 percent of the funding 
for rheumatoid arthritis research focused on 
women; 
Whereas this research gap has had eco-
nomic consequences, including— 
(1) pushing women out of the workforce to 
care for their own health or to act as care-
givers; and 
(2) contributing to increased costs of 
health care because of delays in care; 
Whereas the improvement of women’s 
health relies on sex- and gender-based bio-
medical and clinical research; 
Whereas the promise of personalized medi-
cine cannot be realized without sex- and gen-
der-based parity in research; 
Whereas the WHAM Report states that 
small investments in women’s health re-
search will bring larger returns to the econ-
omy and add productive years to the work-
force of the United States; and 
Whereas the WHAM Report shows that 
doubling current funding focused on women 
across Alzheimer’s disease, coronary artery 
disease, 
and 
rheumatoid 
arthritis 
is 
a 
$300,000,000 investment that would return 
over $13,000,000,000 to the economy of the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses support for viewing women’s 
health as a critical issue for the economy 
and workforce of the United States and for 
advancing the health and well-being of all 
people; and 
(2) supports efforts— 
(A) to increase health research focused on 
women, particularly for diseases that dif-
ferentially 
and 
disproportionately 
affect 
women; 
(B) to double the current share of women’s 
research focused on Alzheimer’s disease (12 
percent), coronary artery disease (4.5 per-
cent), and rheumatoid arthritis (7 percent), 
which the 2021 report entitled ‘‘The Case to 
Fund Women’s Health Research: An Eco-
nomic and Societal Impact Analysis’’, pub-
lished by Women’s Health Access Matters 
shows is a $300,000,000 investment that will 
yield $13,000,000,000 in economic returns; 
(C) to increase awareness of the value of 
sex- and gender-based biomedical research, 
including the benefits to the economy and 
workforce of the United States of accel-
erating health research focused on women; 
and 
(D) to encourage individuals, including re-
searchers, doctors, and patients, to advocate 
for sex- and gender-inclusive research across 
races, ethnicities, socioeconomic statuses, 
disabilities, and age groups.

Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RISCH, Mrs. SHAHEEN, and Mr. JOHNSON) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 638 
Whereas, on February 18, 2022, the United 
States and Moldova marked 30 years of diplo-
matic relations; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, armed 
forces of the Russian Federation began an il-
legal, unjustified, and unprovoked attack on 
Ukraine with missile strikes against densely 
populated urban areas, including Kyiv, the 
capital of Ukraine, and the regional hubs of 
Odesa and Mykolayiv, which lie close to 
Moldova; 
Whereas Moldova is a country of approxi-
mately 2,600,000 people that relies heavily on 
remittances 
sent 
to 
Moldova 
by 
the 
Moldovan diaspora; 
Whereas, in 2011, the Government of 
Moldova passed a law entitled ‘‘Law on Inte-
gration of Foreigners in the Republic of 
Moldova’’, which provided refugees and bene-
ficiaries of humanitarian protection access 
to social security, primary and secondary 
education, medical insurance, cultural inte-
gration support, language classes, and em-
ployment counseling; 
Whereas, prior to the most recent invasion 
of Ukraine by President Vladimir Putin, the 
Government of Moldova assessed that the in-
frastructure in Moldova could accommodate 
not more than 15,000 refugees; 
Whereas, only one day after the com-
mencement of the unconscionable attack on 
Ukraine by President Putin, the people of 
Moldova welcomed more than 16,000 refugees; 
Whereas, since 2014, more than 450,000 refu-
gees fleeing the invasion of Ukraine by 
President Putin had entered Moldova and 
more than 100,000 of such refugees chose to 
remain in Moldova;

Whereas, by March 7, 2022, 89 percent of 
Ukrainian refugees arriving in Moldova were 
women and children; 
Whereas, by March 9, 2022, an estimated 6 
out of every 100 people in Chisinau, the cap-
ital of Moldova, were refugees; 
Whereas, by April 26, 2022, refugees com-
prised more than 16 percent of the popu-
lation of Moldova; 
Whereas the United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Refugees Representative for Cen-
tral Europe Roland Schilling said, ‘‘The atti-
tude of Moldovan authorities is really im-
pressive’’, and noted that ‘‘local commu-
nities came to help refugees, feeding them, 
supporting them’’ at the border; 
Whereas the Government of Moldova has 
created ‘‘green corridors’’ to facilitate the 
crossing of refugees from Ukraine to Roma-
nia and other countries in the European 
Union; 
Whereas, over the past year, the Govern-
ment of Moldova and civil society have em-

system and promoted good governance and 
economic stability in Moldova; 
Whereas, on March 3, 2022, Moldova for-
mally submitted its application to join the 
European Union, signaling a commitment to 
democratic values and the rule of law; 
Whereas, on March 16, 2022, the European

Whereas, on April 22, 2022, a senior mili-
tary official of the Russian Federation indi-
cated that the Russian Federation intended 
to conquer southern Ukraine and join that 
territory with Transnistria, a breakaway re-
gion of Moldova; and 
Whereas, in late April and early May 2022, 
reports

S. RES. 640 
Whereas the Latino population in the 
United States has grown significantly over 
the years on a national basis and Latinos ac-
counted for more than 62,000,000 residents in 
2020; 
Whereas the number of Latinos enrolled at 
an institution of higher education has in-
creased from 2,900,000 in 2010 to 3,600,000 in 
2019; 
Whereas Latinos are responsible for 78 per-
cent of the growth of the labor force of the 
United States since the Great Recession of 
2007 to 2009; 
Whereas the Latino population in the 
United States is growing more rapidly than 
the non-Latino population and has a younger 
median age of 29.5 years, as compared to 40.6 
years among non-Latinos in 2018; 
Whereas the overall number of graduates 
in the fields of science, technology, engineer-
ing, and math (in this preamble referred to 
as ‘‘STEM’’) has increased, but Latino work-
ers remain underrepresented in the STEM 
workforce, making up 18 percent of total em-
ployees across all occupations but only 8 per-
cent of all STEM workers; 
Whereas the percentage of Latino workers 
in STEM occupations has only increased by 
1 percent annually since 2016; 
Whereas the attractiveness of STEM career 
paths is evidenced by the fact that the num-
ber of bachelor’s degrees awarded in STEM 
fields increased for all individuals in the 
United States by 62 percent between 2010 and 
2018, in comparison to a 20 percent growth 
for all other degrees; 
Whereas, 
while 
surveys 
indicate 
that 
Latino students are interested in STEM edu-
cation and aspire to STEM careers at similar 
rates as overrepresented groups, Latinos 
make up a disproportionately low share of 
the STEM workforce; 
Whereas many Latino students are not 
well-positioned to take full advantage of fi-
nancial aid opportunities to attend an insti-
tution of higher education, and the National

May 17, 2022 
Center for Education Statistics reports that 
70 percent of Latino students have unmet fi-
nancial needs, the highest of any demo-
graphic, which is especially true in the case 
of first-generation college students in Latino 
families, making it far more difficult for 
them to pursue STEM education and careers; 
Whereas the growth of well-paying STEM 
jobs is expected to outpace non-STEM jobs in 
the coming years, making STEM fields even 
more attractive for Latino students and 
young adults and increasing the need for new 
strategies to facilitate their entrance into 
STEM fields; and 
Whereas investment in the Latino commu-
nity will generate more individuals eager to 
pursue STEM jobs and will greatly increase 
the domestic high-skilled workforce of the 
United States: Now therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goal of increasing the 
number of Latino individuals in science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics 
(in this resolution referred to as ‘‘STEM’’) as 
a way to promote economic empowerment 
and sustainability, not only in their commu-
nity but in the overall economy of the 
United States; 
(2) supports increasing the representation 
of Latino individuals in STEM fields to en-
hance and improve representation and im-
prove performance in the STEM workforce, 
which will help— 
(A) develop talented and capable STEM 
workers; 
(B) reduce the dependence of the economy 
of the United States on foreign workers; and 
(C) secure the future of the United States 
as a leader in STEM; 
(3) encourages increased Federal support 
for initiatives aimed at boosting the number 
of Latino students who pursue STEM edu-
cation and career paths, particularly engi-
neering; and 
(4) recognizes the important role that His-
panic Serving Institutions and all colleges 
and universities must play in order to 
achieve this goal of increasing Latino indi-
viduals in STEM.

lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 641 
Whereas public works infrastructure, fa-
cilities, and services are of vital importance 
to the health, safety, and well-being of the 
people of the United States; 
Whereas public works infrastructure, fa-
cilities, and services could not be provided 
without the dedicated efforts of public works 
professionals who represent Federal, State, 
and local governments and private sector or-
ganizations throughout the United States; 
Whereas public works professionals design, 
build, operate, and maintain the transpor-
tation systems, water infrastructure, sewage 
and refuse disposal systems, public buildings, 
sanitation and waste management systems, 
and other structures and facilities that are 
vital to the people and communities of the 
United States; 
Whereas public works professionals have 
played, and will continue to play, a key role 
in helping the United States recover from 
the COVID–19 pandemic; and 
Whereas understanding the role that public 
infrastructure plays in protecting the envi-
ronment, improving public health and safe-
ty, contributing to economic vitality, and 
enhancing the quality of life of every com-
munity of the United States is in the inter-
est of the people of the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of May 15 through 
May 21, 2022, as ‘‘National Public Works 
Week’’; 
(2) recognizes and celebrates the important 
contributions that public works profes-
sionals make every day to improve— 
(A) the public infrastructure of the United 
States; and 
(B) the communities that public works pro-
fessionals serve; and 
(3) urges individuals and communities 
throughout the United States to join with 
representatives of the Federal Government 
and the American Public Works Association 
in activities and ceremonies that are de-
signed— 
(A) to pay tribute to the public works pro-
fessionals of the United States; and 
(B) to recognize the substantial contribu-
tions that public works professionals make

SHALL, Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, Mr. CASEY, 
and Mrs. FEINSTEIN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 642 
Whereas diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘DIPG’’) tu-
mors regularly affect 150 to 300 children in 
the United States each year; 
Whereas brain tumors are the leading 
cause of cancer-related death among chil-
dren; 
Whereas DIPG tumors are the leading 
cause of pediatric brain cancer deaths; 
Whereas, with respect to a child who is di-
agnosed with a DIPG tumor and receives 
treatment for a DIPG tumor, the median 
amount of time that the child survives after 
diagnosis is approximately 8 to 11 months; 
Whereas, with respect to an individual who 
is diagnosed with a DIPG tumor, the rate of 
survival 5 years after diagnosis is approxi-
mately 2 percent; 
Whereas the average age at which a child 
is diagnosed with a DIPG tumor is between 5 
and 10 years, resulting in a life expectancy 
approximately 70 years shorter than the av-
erage life expectancy in the United States; 
and 
Whereas the prognosis for children diag-
nosed with DIPG tumors has not improved 
during the past 50 years: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports— 
(A) designating May 17, 2022, as ‘‘DIPG Pe-
diatric Brain Cancer Awareness Day’’; and 
(B) efforts to—

States to become more informed about— 
(A) diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma tu-
mors; 
(B) pediatric brain cancer in general; and 
(C) challenges relating to research on pedi-
atric cancers and ways to advance such re-
search.

TION 40—WELCOMING THE PRIME 
MINISTER OF GREECE TO THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
FOR 
AN 
AD-
DRESS TO A JOINT MEETING OF 
CONGRESS 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
RISCH) submitted the following concur-
rent resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. CON. RES. 40 
Whereas the concept of democracy—that 
the people have the power to govern—was de-
veloped in ancient Greece; 
Whereas the United States and Greece 
have enjoyed more than 150 years of diplo-
matic relations and share deep cultural con-
nections and values; 
Whereas the United States and Greece 
have been partners and allies in all major 
international conflicts throughout modern 
history; 
Whereas Greece heroically resisted Axis 
forces at a crucial moment in World War II, 
forcing Adolf Hitler to change his timeline 
and delaying the attack on the Soviet Union; 
Whereas Winston Churchill said that ‘‘if 
there had not been the virtue and courage of 
the Greeks, we do not know which the out-
come of World War II would have been’’ and 
‘‘no longer will we say that Greeks fight like 
heroes, but that heroes fight like Greeks’’; 
Whereas 
the 
metropolitan 
area 
of 
Mariupol, Ukraine, where forces of the Rus-
sian Federation have committed unconscion-
able war crimes against the local population 
during the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by 
President Vladimir Putin, is home to ap-
proximately 120,000 ethnic Greeks; 
Whereas, after forces of the Russian Fed-
eration bombed a hospital in Ukraine on 
March 9, 2022, Prime Minister of Greece 
Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, on March 18, 2022, 
‘‘Greece is ready to rebuild the maternity 
hospital in Mariupol, the center of Greek mi-
nority in Ukraine, a city dear to our hearts 
and the symbol of barbarity of the war’’; 
Whereas Greece has sent at least 4 humani-
tarian aid shipments to Ukraine, including 
non-perishable 
food, 
bottled 
water, 
antiseptics, medical supplies, and power gen-
erators; 
Whereas Greece has provided Ukraine with 
security assistance, including Kalashnikov 
rifles and portable rocket launchers; 
Whereas membership in the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) has further en-
hanced cooperation between the United 
States and Greece; 
Whereas Greece is an integral part of the 
European Union; 
Whereas the commitment of the United 
States and Greece to security cooperation 
led to the Mutual Defense Cooperation 
Agreement Between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Govern-
ment of the Hellenic Republic, done at Ath-
ens July 8, 1990, which was updated in 2021 to

United States to help reinforce the eastern 
flank of NATO and deter further aggression 
by the Russian Federation against allies and 
partners of the United States; 
Whereas the Floating Storage and Re-
gasification Unit of Alexandroupoli, recently 
inaugurated, will contribute significantly to 
energy diversification of Greece and south-
eastern Europe, especially in light of the in-
vasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federa-
tion; 
Whereas the United States has dem-
onstrated its support for the trilateral part-
nership of Greece, Israel, and Cyprus by en-
acting into law the Eastern Mediterranean 
Security and Energy Partnership Act of 2019 
(title II of division J of Public Law 116–94) 
and through joint engagement with Greece, 
Israel, and Cyprus in the 3+1 format; 
Whereas this support was bolstered in the 
United States-Greece Defense and Inter-
parliamentary Partnership Act of 2021 (sub-
title B of title XIII of Public Law 117–81), es-
tablishing a 3+1 Interparliamentary Group to 
discuss the expansion of cooperation in other 
areas of common concern; 
Whereas the United States is home to a ro-
bust Greek-American community of approxi-
mately 3,000,000 people, who meaningfully 
contribute to the cultural fabric of the 
United States; and 
Whereas the Speaker of the House has in-
vited Prime Minister Mitsotakis to address a 
joint meeting of Congress on May 17, 2022: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That the Senate— 
(1) warmly welcomes Prime Minister of 
Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis to the United 
States; 
(2) eagerly anticipates the address of Prime 
Minister Mitsotakis before a joint meeting 
of Congress;

amid 
the 
ongoing 
brutal

unprovoked invasion by the Russian Federa-
tion; 
(4) commits to a continued partnership 
with Greece to bolster energy cooperation

energy security in Europe; 
(5) reaffirms the steadfast and bipartisan

TRIBUTE 
TO 
CARMENITA 
HELLIGAR—28TH 
CONGRES-
SIONAL 
DISTRICT 
WOMAN 
OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Carmenita 
Helligar of Burbank, California. 
In addition to being a successful business 
owner and activist, Ms. Helligar is a dedicated 
volunteer in the community, serving as a 
Board of Library Trustee for the City of Bur-
bank and on the Burbank Unified School Dis-
trict’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Com-
mittee, which fosters inclusive curriculum and 
equity of college prep classes for all students. 
Ms. Helligar credits her grandmother, Ernes-
tine, lovingly referred to as Grandma Stein, as 
her inspiration for volunteerism, as she taught 
Ms. Helligar that we are on this earth to help 
people. Earnestine also encouraged Ms. 
Helligar to believe that a person can do any-
thing if they’re willing to try, which is an atti-
tude Ms. Helligar has adopted in her life. 
Ms. Helligar is one of the founders of The 
Destiny Education Project (DEP), a non-profit 
BIPOC-led 
organization, 
where 
‘‘Destiny’’ 
stands for Diversity, Equity, Sustainability, 
Teaching Inclusivity & Nurturing Youth. DEP 
strives for every student to feel safe as well as 
learn in an inclusive and supported edu-
cational environment. 
An avid supporter of small businesses, Ms. 
Helligar is the Founder/CEO of Local As Can 
Bee (LACB), an e-commerce marketplace for 
individuals who own a small business. Ms. 
Helligar’s goal is for LACB to become a na-
tional Co-Op which will be a source for sec-
ondary income for small business owners to 
boost community support. 
Ms. Helligar and her husband, Jeffrey, have 
three children, and are also raising Ms. 
Helligar’s niece. An interior designer by trade, 
Ms. Helligar enjoys designing whenever she 
has free time and loves to bake. She is also 
an avid reader and tries to read at least one 
book a week. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Carmenita 
Helligar. 
RECOGNIZING THE 40-YEAR ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE WASHINGTON 
TIMES 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful to recognize The 
Washington Times on their 40-year anniver-
sary. 
Since its founding on May 17, 1982, The 
Washington Times has been a valuable re-
source by providing clear and informative arti-
cles on current events and national politics. I 
appreciate their continued service and look 
forward to reading their publication for many 
years to come. 
The following article, ‘‘Washington Times’ 
Only Agenda is the Agenda of its Readers,’’ 
published May 16, 2022, by Christopher 
Dolan, President and Executive Editor, and 
Charles Hurt, Opinion Editor, encapsulates 
their years of journalistic accomplishments: 
Dear readers: 
For 40 years, The Washington Times has 
stood sentinel along the banks of the Poto-
mac River, shining a bright light into all 
corners of the federal government. 
During Republican administrations and 
Democratic administrations alike, the paper 
has been unflinching in keeping its responsi-
bility to inform readers and expose govern-
ment shenanigans. 
Long before ‘‘fair and balanced’’ became a 
battle cry and the proliferation of websites 
spanning the political spectrum, there was 
The Washington Times, beholden to no one 
and no party. 
When Ronald Reagan stormed into Wash-
ington on a promise to ‘‘make America great 
again,’’ The Washington Times was there 
and chronicled the historic collapse of the 
Soviet Union. 
When George H.W. Bush won the Gulf War, 
only to later stumble on his pledge of ‘‘no 
new taxes,’’ The Washington Times was 
there. 
When a young, smooth-talking governor 
from Arkansas stunned the political world, 
The Washington Times was there. And for 
eight years, the paper produced award-win-
ning political coverage that culminated in 
President Clinton’s impeachment and inves-
tigations that to this day leave many ques-
tions unanswered. 
During the epic 2000 presidential election 
recount in Florida, The Times was there, 
counting chads and recording every legal ar-
gument all the way to the Supreme Court. 
On Sept. 11, 2001, The Washington Times 
was there. And never forgot. 
The Times stood watch from the trium-
phant march into Baghdad to the bitter end 
of George W. Bush’s presidency. 
The Times was there for the hopeful dawn 
of President Obama’s inauguration to the re-
jection of his presidency with the election of 
Donald Trump. 
Of course, politics is the bread and butter 
of any newspaper based in Washington. But 
The Times also has invested unparalleled en-
ergies into covering the First Amendment, 
religious freedom, American culture, gun 
rights and social issues that many other 
newspaper shy from. 
The only agenda of The Washington Times 
is the agenda of its readers. If it is important 
to you, it is important to us. It has always 
been that way. 
Over the past four decades, tumultuous 
changes have wracked the newspaper indus-
try. 
Today, there is greater competition among 
news outlets—both in print and online—than 
ever before in human history. The most 
vaunted and venerated publications must 
now compete with any other outlet with a 
web address and a keyboard. 
But to this day, The Washington Times has 
never surrendered its independence, its dedi-
cation to accuracy and its devotion to the 
interests of its readers. 
Thank you for reading. We hope you will 
keep reading for the next 40 years.

RECOGNIZING DONALD TOBIN 
HON. JOHN P. SARBANES 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I join 
Congressman ERIC SWALWELL in rising today, 
to recognize Donald Tobin as he steps down 
as Dean of the University of Maryland’s Carey 
School of Law and returns to being a full-time 
member of the Law School’s teaching faculty. 
As Dean of the Law School for the past 
eight years, Dean Tobin has played a critical 
role in expanding and strengthening the Law 
School’s engagement on key issues including 
systemic racism, poverty and democratic gov-
ernance. 
For example, as Baltimore City grappled 
with the tragic death of Freddie Gray, Dean 
Tobin created opportunities for community out-
reach and engagement through the Law 
School. He also established new clinical op-
portunities for students to address criminal de-
fense, seek justice for victims of crime and 
provide free legal services to asylum seekers. 
As a leading expert on the intersection of 
tax and campaign finance laws, Dean Tobin 
has also testified before both Congress and 
the Federal Election Commission—sharing his 
insights of how the tax code can contribute to 
regulating political contributions in our elec-
toral process. 
Early in his career, right out of college, 
Dean Tobin also dedicated eight years in serv-
ice to the Maryland community as a profes-
sional staff member for my father, the late 
Senator Paul Sarbanes, whom he considered 
a mentor and friend. 
In a wonderful tribute to Senator Sarbanes 
which he shared with the Law School commu-
nity in December 2020, Dean Tobin described 
traits that are equally applicable to him: a 
strong moral compass, a dedication to hard 
work and a commitment to the rule of law. 
Dean Tobin embodied these traits in his 
work on the Senate Committee on the Budget 
and the Joint Economic Committee as well as

throughout his legal career as a clerk for the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit 
and an appellate attorney in the Tax Division 
of the Department of Justice. 
I commend Dean Tobin for his public serv-
ice and his service as the leader of the Carey 
School of Law, and I wish him the best as he 
returns to educating the next generation of 
lawyers in the classroom.

TRIBUTE TO JANICE SEGALL—28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Janice Segall 
of Pasadena, California. 
Ms. Segall and her family moved a great 
deal during her youth, given her father was in 
the United States Air Force. After graduating 
from high school in Redlands, California, she 
attended the University of Redlands, Univer-
sity of California, Irvine and University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley, where she obtained her 
teaching credential. 
Ms. Segall had an outstanding nearly three- 
decade career with the Los Angeles Unified 
School District (LAUSD) as an elementary 
school teacher in east Los Angeles. During 
her time with the LAUSD, she also coordi-
nated the Gifted and Talented programs, 
worked for the University of California, Los An-
geles (UCLA)’s Writing Project, and was a 
math instructional coach for seven years. With 
an interest in combining literature and art, she 
was one of the first teachers in the young chil-
dren’s art programs, a collaborative effort with 
the Museum of Contemporary Art and LAUSD. 
After her retirement from LAUSD in 2011, she 
worked part-time for the UCLA Math Project 
as a coach-facilitator for the CGI Math Initia-
tive in various schools across Los Angeles. 
Ms. Segall’s volunteer activities have in-
cluded serving the Ronald McDonald House 
Pasadena and as an after-school tutor at 
826LA in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los 
Angeles. Her current volunteer activities in-
clude preparing lunches for Union Station 
Pasadena and fostering a puppy with Guide 
Dogs for the Blind. Passionate about sup-
porting literacy and public libraries, she is Past 
President of the San Rafael Library Associates 
and currently President of The Friends of the 
Pasadena Public Library. 
A long-time resident of Pasadena, Ms. 
Segall enjoys spending time with her sons, 
Alex and Peter, and two grandsons, along with 
reading, movies, and hiking. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 
28th 
Congressional 
District, 
Janice 
Segall. 
HONORING POLICE CHIEF ROBERT 
DRISCOLL OF PLEASANT HILL 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor one of Missouri’s finest, Chief 
Robert Driscoll. After serving his community 
by providing public safety for more than three 
decades, Chief Driscoll announced his retire-
ment from the Pleasant Hill Police Department 
in Missouri’s Fourth Congressional District. 
Residents of Pleasant Hill have long benefited 
from Chief Driscoll’s selfless commitment to 
serve and protect, and his steady leadership 
will be missed. 
Chief Driscoll began his career with the 
Pleasant Hill Police Department in 1984, 
where he quickly rose through the ranks to 
Chief of Police in 1996 thanks to his integrity 
and commitment to serving his community. 
Throughout his years of dedicated service, 
Chief Driscoll has led his department and the 
City of Pleasant Hill through devastating 
events, such as fires, floods, ice storms, torna-
does, building collapses, and train accidents, 
while keeping crime at bay. In these times of 
crisis, Chief Driscoll stood as a resilient, 
steady leader which his community could turn 
to for guidance. 
Among Chief Driscoll’s most notable accom-
plishments were bringing 9–1–1 to Pleasant 
Hill and integrating the dispatch system into a 
county-wide 
emergency 
network 
system. 
Thanks to Chief Driscoll’s advocacy and lead-
ership through the implementation of these 
emergency services, Pleasant Hill’s over eight 
thousand residents are safer and get the help 
that they need sooner. 
Chief Driscoll exudes all the necessary 
qualities critical to effectively advocating and 
representing one’s community as a public 
servant and a law enforcement officer—steady 
leadership, unwavering devotion to serving 
others, admirable character, and a positive at-
titude. On behalf of Missouri’s Fourth Con-
gressional District, I thank him and his family 
for their immense devotion to serving our com-
munity and keeping us safe. Congratulations 
on a well-deserved retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF BRANDON 
LEAKE 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing Brandon 
Leake for his many contributions and accom-
plishments, including his historic win of Sea-
son 15 of America’s Got Talent. 
Brandon is a native of Stockton, California, 
and has made invaluable contributions to his 
community by helping others through poetry. 
In addition to having served as an academic 
advisor at San Joaquin Delta College, Bran-
don is the founder and CEO of Called to 
Move, an organization dedicated to inspiring 
people of all ages and backgrounds to prac-
tice the art of poetry. Called to Move encour-
ages personal development and self-actualiza-
tion and aims to help people achieve their pur-
pose in life through the arts. Brandon has held 
workshops and has traveled across the coun-
try to share his knowledge and gifts as a poet. 
Brandon won Season 15 of America’s Got 
Talent with his captivating spoken-word per-
formances, and he made history as the first- 
ever poet to win America’s Got Talent. 
Through the power of words, Brandon has 
shown the world that our experiences and our 
stories can uplift, encourage, and inspire. His 
honest and vulnerable performances not only 
tell his story, but also those of others that 
need to be heard. 
Please join me in recognizing Brandon 
Leake’s many contributions and congratulating 
him on his win of Season 15 of America’s Got 
Talent.

TRIBUTE TO NANCY BEYDA—28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Nancy Beyda 
of Hollywood Hills, California. 
Ms. Beyda was born in Vincennes, Indiana. 
In 1981, she moved to Los Angeles to attend 
the University of California, Los Angeles and 
start her film career as an editor. After meet-
ing her husband, Kent, and becoming the 
mother of three, Ms. Beyda decided to take a 
step back from her career to raise her chil-
dren. It was during this time Ms. Beyda real-
ized her passion for infant and maternal 
wellness that would ultimately launch her ca-
reer as a midwife. Ms. Beyda has delivered 
hundreds of babies throughout the years to 
mothers in Los Angeles and ran a baby group 
offering support to new parents. 
A tireless and dedicated volunteer driven to 
help the community, Ms. Beyda has selflessly 
given her time to support individuals who are 
unhoused and food insecure. She volunteered 
at The Center in Hollywood, a homelessness 
resource center focused on ending homeless-
ness and isolation in Hollywood, and currently 
serves on the Board of Directors. Ms. Beyda 
has also led a gift drive every year for the chil-
dren of the women living in Good Shepherd 
Shelter. 
Ms. Beyda’s strong spirit and love for vol-
unteerism led her to establish an extraordinary 
non-profit organization, FoodCycle LA, which 
picks up excess food from businesses, such 
as restaurants and grocery stores in Los An-
geles and delivers the food to organizations 
serving people in need. From its humble be-
ginning as a small volunteer group, with Ms. 
Beyda picking up surplus food from one gro-
cery 
store 
with 
help 
from 
her 
friends, 
FoodCycle LA has blossomed under Ms. 
Beyda’s leadership and has grown to serve 
nearly 70,000 meals every week. They also 
use innovative technology to expand their im-
pact, serving more than three million meals in

SUPPORTING UTERINE FIBROID 
RESEARCH AND EDUCATION 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of a critical issue facing women’s 
health that is often misunderstood, grossly un-
derfunded, and has significant ripple effects on 
a woman’s physical and mental health. This 
condition is uterine fibroids: noncancerous 
growths in the uterus that can cause severe 
bleeding, body pain, infertility and mis-
carriages, and several other consequences. 
Uterine fibroids affect 70 percent of White 
women and 80 percent of Black women in the 
U.S. during their lifetime. Each year, over 
200,000 women undergo hysterectomies for 
uterine fibroids, with Black women twice as 
likely to undergo this treatment to alleviate 
symptoms. We need to do more for these 
women. Other treatments exist, and we cannot 
allow a lack of awareness to put women 
through an unnecessary, lifechanging oper-
ation. We do not need to deprive women of 
their right to have children, to instruct them to 
sit home for six weeks and recover from such 
an invasive procedure, to put them at risk of 
complications. 
More must be done to research uterine 
fibroids, educate health care professionals, 
and raise awareness for patients. I am proud 
to cosponsor H.R. 2007, the Stephanie Tubbs 
Jones Uterine Fibroid Research and Education 
Act of 2021, as it would expand and coordi-
nate uterine fibroid research at NIH and direct 
HHS to issue an awareness campaign and re-
search Medicaid coverage of uterine fibroids. 
We are in Women’s Health Month. In this 
Month, we reflect upon the important women 
in our lives, and how medical research must 
better represent them. I am proud to support 
the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Uterine Fibroid 
Research and Education Act of 2021 and urge 
my colleagues to join me. This condition can-
not wait, women suffering with this condition 
cannot wait, and this bill cannot wait.

HONORING THOMAS PETERS, PH.D. 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Thomas Peters, Ph.D. 
upon his retirement from Marin Community 
Foundation as its intrepid president and chief 
executive officer for nearly a quarter of a cen-
tury and for a lifetime of extraordinary public 
service. 
Dr. Peters graduated from the University of 
Minnesota with a doctorate in medicine, psy-
chology, and genetics. In 1974, he was hired 
by the San Francisco Public Health Depart-
ment to manage a team of healthcare workers 
providing physical and mental care to both vic-
tims and perpetrators of crime. Within 7 years, 
he was promoted to Chief of Staff and tasked 
to navigate the unprecedented HIV/AIDS epi-
demic gripping San Francisco. In 1991, after a 
lengthy tenure as Chief of Staff for the San 
Francisco Public Health Department, Dr. 
Peters was selected to serve as the director of 
Marin County’s Department of Health and 
Human Services before joining the Marin 
Community Foundation (MCF) in 1998. 
Throughout his time with MCF, Dr. Peters 
demonstrated impeccable leadership, estab-
lishing MCF as one of the largest community 
foundations in the country with an exceptional 
reputation for its mission-driven value align-
ment. Under his leadership, the foundation in-
creased its assets from approximately $900 
million to more than $3 billion and distributed 
over $2 billion in grants to support early edu-
cation through college, affordable housing, 
and environmental stewardship. Dr. Peters ac-
complished this by attracting an unprece-
dented number of new donors and starting a 
donor-advised funds program, while also re-
shaping the governance structure and re-
focusing the Foundation’s priorities to address 
Marin County’s profound income and edu-
cational inequities. While focusing on big 
issues, Dr. Peters also led in a manner that 
both promoted and supported local and inno-
vative solutions from grassroots community 
groups and nonprofits. His unwavering com-
mitment to social justice provided both voice 
and philanthropic giving to underserved and 
disenfranchised communities in Marin County, 
as well as models for philanthropic organiza-
tions to follow throughout the region, state, 
and Nation. 
Always one to respond to a crisis, Dr. 
Peters rounded out his legacy during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, directing the Foundation 
to provide critical relief for Marin in the form of 
millions in nonprofit grant funding, PPE for 
local healthcare facilities, and rental assist-
ance in partnership with Marin County. 
Over the decades we developed a close 
bond, and my staff and I had the good fortune 
to experience Dr. Peters’ maverick problem- 
solving talents firsthand, evoking the spirit of 
Congressman John Lewis to collaborate, or as 
we liked to say, get in ‘‘good trouble’’ to tackle 
issues like gun violence prevention and 
NIMBYism. Among many special memories is 
our work in 2012 to help save China Camp 
State Park from closure. With the support of 
the Foundation and my successful legislation 
to keep state parks open, the local nonprofit 
Friends of China Camp now operates China 
Camp State Park. 
Dr. Peters has delivered on the mission of 
Marin Community Foundation to improve the 
human condition, embrace diversity, promote 
a humane and democratic society, and en-
hance the community’s quality of life, now and 
for future generations. He has been the moral 
compass for the Foundation and Marin County 
for decades and retires with a legacy that will 
serve us for many years to come. Madam 
Speaker, I respectfully ask that you join me in 
expressing immense gratitude to Dr. Peters for 
his extraordinary generosity of spirit, unwaver-
ing integrity, and innumerable contributions to 
improving the human condition, and extending 
to him congratulations on his retirement and 
best wishes on his next endeavors. 
HONORING UNITED STATES ARMY 
VETERAN 
LAWRENCE 
‘‘REX’’ 
CARNEY FOR HIS BRAVE SERV-
ICE THROUGHOUT WORLD WAR II 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor United States Army veteran 
Lawrence ‘‘Rex’’ Carney as he posthumously 
is awarded the New York State Senate Liberty 
Medal. 
Rex was born on October 27, 1918 in Still-
water, New York. After graduating from Still-
water High School, Rex went on to play semi- 
professional basketball and baseball. In July of 
1941, Rex was sworn into the United States 
Army at Fort Jay, Governor’s Island in New 
York City. After completing basic training at 
Fort Dix, New Jersey, Rex was assigned as a 
gunner in an Anti-aircraft Artillery regiment in 
North Carolina. Following the Pearl Harbor at-
tacks, Rex was transferred to Hawaii, where 
he attended Ranger Combat School. After 
completion of his training, Rex was promoted 
to an instructor at the Unit Jungle Training 
Center. 
Rex’s unit, the 867th Anti-Aircraft Artillery 
Automatic Weapon Battalion, was sent to the 
Mariana Islands in anticipation of a Japanese 
invasion. Following the end of hostilities with 
Japan, after the dropping of the Atomic 
Bombs, Rex returned to Fort Dix, New Jersey. 
He was honorably discharged on September 
1, 1945. After his service, Rex worked as a 
pipe fitter at the Steamfitters and Plumbers 
Local No. 105 in Schenectady until his retire-
ment in 1983. He was a passionate advocate 
for veterans and a member of the American 
Legion Post 490 as well as the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars Post 6328. 
For his honorable and brave service, Rex 
Carney was awarded the American Defense 
Service Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Service 
Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal. On be-
half of New York’s 21st Congressional District, 
I thank Rex Carney for his service, and I am 
proud to honor his legacy of defending Amer-
ican freedom and democracy as he is award-
ed the New York State Senate Liberty Medal.

HONORING RABBI JOE ROOKS 
RAPPORT 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of my friend, Rabbi Joe 
Rooks Rapport, as he begins his much-de-
served retirement. 
Since 1988, Rabbi Rapport has served at 
The Temple, Congregation Adath Israel Brith 
Sholom, the oldest and largest synagogue in 
Kentucky. During his time at The Temple he 
has been an incredible leader, teaching a vari-
ety of adult education classes, working closely 
with Bar and Bat Mitzvah students, leading 
countless congregational programs, and serv-
ing as rabbinic liaison for the Brotherhood, 
The Temple Archives, and The Temple Li-
brary. 
In addition to his spiritual leadership, Rabbi 
Rapport is also a deeply involved community 
leader, serving as a member of the Presi-
dent’s Advisory Council of the University of 
Louisville and sharing a seat on the Board of 
Directors of both the Center for Interfaith Rela-
tions and Kentucky Interfaith Power and Light, 
alongside his wife, Rabbi Rooks. He also is a 
former chair of the Louisville Coalition for the 
Homeless and Many People One Community, 
a diversity project of the National Conference 
for Community and Justice. 
Rabbi Rapport’s deep devotion to his faith 
has also called him to always lend a voice on 
behalf of the less fortunate or the oppressed. 
Whenever incidents of intolerance or injustice 
rear their ugly head in our community—wheth-
er racial or religious, Jewish or not—Rabbi 
Rapport is one of the first people there, offer-
ing his support to those victimized and stand-
ing up for decency and good in our commu-
nity. This is why I firmly believe, in my years 
of friendship with Rabbi Rapport, that he is the 
true embodiment of the Hebrew phrase Tikkun 
Olam—or ‘‘world repair’’—a mandate to not 
just look out for our own moral and spiritual 
welfare, but also the welfare of society as a 
whole. Rabbi Rapport not only teaches the 
lessons of social justice, he lives them each 
and every day. 
Rabbi Rapport is a treasure to our commu-
nity and is truly a ‘‘mensch’’ in every sense of 
the word. He has never grown weary of help-
ing others, and during his 34 years of service 
to our Commonwealth, he has enriched count-
less lives with his wise words and spiritual 
guidance. Rabbi Rapport has not only inspired 
me, but also a younger generation of leaders 
who will continue his passionate pursuit of 
peace, love, and justice in the world for years 
to come. 
On behalf of the people of Kentucky’s Third 
Congressional District and the city of Louis-
ville, it is my honor to recognize Rabbi Joe 
Rooks Rapport for his outstanding leadership, 
his friendship, and his unyielding love for our 
city and the people who call it home. 
I wish Rabbi Rapport nothing but the best in 
his well-deserved retirement, and I hope he 
enjoys every single moment of his time spent 
with family and loved ones.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ENSURING 
FULL 
PARTICIPATION 
IN 
THE 
CENSUS ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Ensuring Full Participation in the 
Census Act of 2022, which would prohibit the 
U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) from including 
questions on the decennial census about citi-
zenship, nationality or immigration status. 
This bill is essential because, prior to the 
2020 census, the Department of Justice wrote 
to the Bureau requesting that it ‘‘reinstate on 
the 2020 [c]ensus questionnaire a question re-
garding citizenship.’’ From 1970–2000, this 
question was sent to only approximately 16 
percent of the population during any decennial 
census through the so-called ‘‘long-form.’’ 
However, the long-form system was dropped 
from the census and replaced with the current 
American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS 
is sent to approximately 3 million people annu-
ally on a rotational basis, and allows the Bu-
reau to get the necessary information on citi-
zenship. Asking questions about citizenship 
status to every person through the decennial 
census has not been done in almost 70 years 
because it would discourage people, largely 
minorities, who are already undercounted in 
the census, from participating in the census. 
The ACS was created to make the decennial 
census simpler for people to complete, which 
facilitates higher and more accurate participa-
tion rates and preserving privacy. 
Fortunately, after a protracted legal and po-
litical process, the citizenship question was not 
included on the 2020 census. However, this 
legislation is necessary to ensure it cannot be 
asked on a future census. The representative 
sampling provided by the ACS is more than 
sufficient to determine citizenship statistics in 
the U.S. We must ensure that all individuals 
are counted in the decennial census, thereby 
providing accurate allocation of federal funds 
and representation in Congress, and not re-
duce participation by asking a question that is 
already asked elsewhere. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

CELEBRATING THE 90TH 
BIRTHDAY OF MS. VIRGINIA KEE 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to celebrate the 90th birthday of Ms. Vir-
ginia Kee, a dedicated public servant, longtime 
constituent, and a dear friend. She is widely 
recognized, respected and a pillar of strength 
in New York City’s Chinatown community. I 
met Ms. Kee three decades ago when I first 
ran for office. She welcomed me and helped 
me better understand the social, immigration 
and small businesses needs of the commu-
nity. I realized that Ms. Kee and I were more 
alike than different and for that reason I am al-
ways grateful for her friendship. 
As an Asian American woman, Virginia’s ex-
perience with the systemic racism in her com-
munity helped forge her passion for social jus-
tice and strengthened her determination to 
break barriers. As a dedicated New York City 
public school teacher in the 1960’s, Ms. Kee 
witnessed first-hand the poverty and disadvan-
tages faced by Asian immigrant students and 
their families. She realized that the best weap-
on against poverty was education and she dili-
gently worked to motivate students to learn 
and achieve. Virginia became actively en-
gaged in the community after the passage of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. 
An act that overhauled the immigration system 
and lifted the longstanding policy of limiting 
immigration based on national origin. This new 
policy opened the door for Asian immigrants 
with families living in the United States. 
Ms. Kee was devoted to advancing the so-
cial and economic conditions of her commu-
nity. As an advocate for children, she was in-
strumental in bringing the first Youth and Head

Start Program to Chinatown in 1965. In addi-
tion, to address the growing needs of China-
town’s Asian American low-income and immi-
grant communities she became the founding 
member of the Chinese American Planning 
Council (CPC), one the largest and most com-
prehensive organizations serving low-income 
Asian American families in the Northeast. 
Today, decades later, CPC serves more than 
60,000 families annually and continues to de-
liver cultural and holistic services to New York 
City’s expanding Asian community. Ms. Kee 
remains an active member of the Board. 
Ms. Kee realized early that civic engage-
ment and political participation were key to se-
curing resources, making local decisions, and 
improving public services in her community. A 
pioneer both as a woman and an Asian Amer-
ican, she became one of the first Chinese 
Americans to be elected to party office in the 
Democratic Party. In 1980 she was a member 
of Governor James Hunt’s Commission setting 
the rules for the Democratic Presidential 
Nominating Procedures. She fought for and 
achieved the inclusion of Asian American rep-
resentation as delegates to the Democratic 
Party Presidential Convention. Her relentless 
efforts in community action have resulted in 
the empowerment of her community. In year 
2000 she served as a member of the New 
York State Electoral College. She has been a 
strong voice for equitable representation by 
Asian Americans in all levels of government 
and voting rights in New York City. 
Over the years Virginia has received numer-
ous awards. She was recognized by the Na-
tional Conference of Christians and Jews as 
one of their Fifty Extraordinary Women. United 
Federation of Teachers presented her an 
award for community service. Her alma mater, 
Hunter College of the City of New York in-
ducted her into their Hall of Fame. In the after-
math of Abner Louima, she provided leader-
ship on the Taskforce on Police and Commu-
nity. She was a Member of the New York City 
Human Rights Commission and a champion 
against hate crimes and civil rights violations. 
Ms. Virginia Kee’s life, public service and 
love of her community is an example of a life 
well-lived serving others. Her poise, elegance 
and authenticity are admirable. Therefore, 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you rise with me 
today to honor and celebrate Ms. Virginia 
Kee’s 90th Birthday.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
BECKY 
GELHAAR— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize 
a 
remarkable 
woman, 
Becky 
Gelhaar of La Can˜ada Flintridge, California. 
Born in Spokane, Washington and raised in 
Illinois, Ms. Gelhaar graduated from Miami 
University in Ohio, married her high school 
sweetheart, Chuck Gelhaar, and taught high 
school physical education in Illinois. In the 
mid-1960’s, 
the 
Gelhaars 
moved 
to 
La 
Can˜ada Flintridge, where they raised their two 
children, Lisa and Laura. 
Ms. Gelhaar immediately got involved in her 
new community, joining the Newcomers Club, 
and with other Newcomers Club members, co- 
founding the La Can˜ada Junior Women’s 
Club. The consummate volunteer, Ms. Gelhaar 
maintains that her life of volunteer service 
began with the La Can˜ada Junior Women’s 
Club, where she chaired many committees 
and became involved in other organizations, 
such as the American Red Cross, serving as 
President of the La Can˜ada Flintridge chapter 
and on the board of the Pasadena chapter. 
Active in Parent Teacher Associations (PTA), 
she held several chairmanships, serving as La 
Can˜ada High School 7/8 PTA President, on 
the PTA Council, and on the board of La 
Can˜ada Flintridge Educational Foundation. 
Ms. Gelhaar was also a Girl Scout leader and 
served on the Girl Scout Council. 
Other organizations Ms. Gelhaar has partici-
pated in include Chapter OM, P.E.O. (Philan-
thropic Educational Organization), La Can˜ada 
Flintridge Delta Gamma alumnae group, and, 
as a result of her interest in gardening, La 
Can˜ada Valley Beautiful. In addition, she has 
been involved with the Assistance League of 
Flintridge for over three decades and the La 
Can˜ada Flintridge Coordinating Council for 
over two decades. Her most recent activity is 
as Corresponding Secretary of the Daughters 
of the American Revolution. For her unstinting 
and outstanding service to the La Can˜ada 
Flintridge community, she received the PTA 
Service Award and the Les Tupper Commu-
nity Service Award. 
Ms. Gelhaar and Chuck, her husband of 
nearly sixty years, enjoy traveling and spend-
ing time with their family, especially their five 
grandchildren, Jack, Kelly, Casey, Kyle, and 
Megan. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 
28th 
Congressional 
District, 
Becky 
Gelhaar.

CYBERSECURITY GRANTS FOR 
SCHOOLS ACT OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6868, 
the Cybersecurity Grants for Schools Act of 
2022, would authorize the Director of the Cy-
bersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA) to award grants to states, local govern-
ments, and educational institutions for cyber-
security curriculum and educational tools. 
The threat of cyberattacks from Russia and 
other foreign adversaries is more prevalent 
than ever. By incorporating cybersecurity into 
our school’s curriculum, alongside core sub-
jects like math and science, we will be able to 
bring up the next generation with a strong 
foundation to not only protect themselves indi-
vidually from cybercrimes, but also to inspire 
greater participation in the cybersecurity work-
force. 
Cyber attacks are the next frontier in the 
great power competition with China and Rus-
sia and we must act now to mitigate this threat 
and build resilience throughout our citizenry. 
I was pleased to work closely with the 
Cyber Innovation Center and CYBER.ORG to 
draft this legislation, and to have since re-
ceived the support of the Center for Excel-
lence in Education and other industry leaders. 
We all recognize the national security impera-
tive that is cybersecurity literacy. 
I am hopeful the House will pass this bipar-
tisan legislation with broad support, and the 
Senate will act quickly to do the same, so we 
can begin to increase the cyber skills pipeline, 
recruit new students, and empower the future 
cyber workforce.

RECOGNIZING DEAN DONALD 
TOBIN 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with Congressman JOHN SAR-
BANES, to recognize Donald Tobin, who is 
stepping down after eight years of service as 
Dean at the Maryland Carey Law. Dean Tobin 
will be returning to full-time teaching as a 
member of the faculty. 
Dean Tobin was instrumental in creating a 
culture where students could tackle tough 
issues from systematic racism to crime and 
poverty to privacy and technology. And I know 
that the Carey Law school credits Dean Tobin 
with uniting the law school community and ex-
panding student opportunities for community 
engagement. 
Following the tragic death of Freddie Gray, 
Dean Tobin strengthened the Carey Law 
School’s community outreach efforts and pro-
vided opportunities for students to serve those 
in need. He also assisted with the opening of 
the Chaco´n Center for Immigrant Justice, 
which provides free legal services to clients 
facing issues of asylum; added a new Appel-
late Clinic to the Maryland Carey Law’s Immi-
gration Clinic; and helped to provide scholar-
ships for students interested in studying immi-
gration law. 
In addition, under Dean Tobin’s leadership, 
the Carey Law school expanded its Clinical 
Law Program, in which student attorneys pro-
vide free legal services to low-income resi-
dents. He also launched new clinics in criminal 
defense and justice for victims of crime, and 
oversaw the doubling of scholarship spending, 
which helped the law school attract diverse 
and impressive applicants. 
Furthermore, Dean Tobin served his com-
munity by participating on the Maryland Ac-
cess to Justice Commission, which unites 
state leaders to improve the civil justice sys-
tem and served on the Maryland Court of Ap-
peals committee to advise on the Uniform Bar 
Exam, which Maryland adopted in 2019. 
As a law student of Dean Tobin, I will be 
forever thankful for his commitment to edu-
cating the next generation of lawyers and 
leaders. I rise today to recognize his service.

CONGRATULATING KENDALL EVE-
LYN MARCHANT ON HER GRAD-
UATION FROM THE HOCKADAY 
SCHOOL 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Kendall Evelyn Marchant, who 
is the granddaughter of my distinguished 
former colleague, Congressman Kenny March-
ant, on her graduation from The Hockaday 
School on May 14, 2022. Kendall was born on 
December 19, 2003, in Dallas County, Texas 
to Lindsay (Hill) and Matthew Marchant. She 
is the sister of Hayden Marchant and the 
granddaughter of Kenny and Donna Marchant 
and Rod and Sherry Hill. 
Kendall has attended the world-renowned 
Hockaday School since pre-kindergarten and 
has consistently made her family proud 
through her numerous academic and non-aca-
demic achievements. During high school, Ken-
dall was on the Head of School List every se-
mester, in addition to earning the Senior His-
tory Award, a Gold Medal and a Silver Medal 
in the National Spanish Exam, and the AP 
Scholar with Honor distinction. 
Kendall 
also 
pursued 
numerous 
extracurriculars 
while 
at 
The 
Hockaday 
School, serving as a member of the school’s 
Honor Council and the co-president of the 
Hockaday Young Republicans. Due to her 
keen interest in film, Kendall founded the 
Hockaday Film Society, where she also 
served as the group’s president. Additionally, 
Kendall’s submission to the All-American High 
School Film Festival was chosen as an Official 
Selection, demonstrating her talent in the field. 
Finishing out the triple crown of her scho-
lastic accomplishments, Kendall is also a phe-
nomenal athlete who played lacrosse, softball, 
and was a 3-year member of the varsity bas-
ketball team, where she served as Captain in 
her senior year. Her athletic awards include 
the Split H award and the Athlete of the Week. 
Outside of school, Kendall is very involved 
with helping her community. She volunteers at 
the First Baptist Church of Carrollton as an 
engagement leader and mentor and serves as 
a tutor with the North Texas Reading Partners 
Program. She also volunteered at Metrocrest 
Services during critical months of the COVID– 
19 pandemic, helping to provide food to the 
most vulnerable. 
Lastly, Kendall served as a crew member at 
the AMC Northpark Theater in 2021 and was 
active with the North Dallas YoungLife pro-
gram. 
Kendall is most importantly a wonderful and 
caring daughter, sister, niece, cousin, and 
granddaughter to her loving family members. 
She will attend Baylor University in the Fall of 
2022 as a University Scholar, with concentra-
tions in History and Neuroscience with a minor 
in Creative Writing. 
I ask all of my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring Kendall Marchant on her graduation from 
The Hockaday School and wish her success 
at Baylor University.

CELEBRATING 50 YEAR RELATION-
SHIP BETWEEN QATAR AND THE 
U.S. 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, it is my honor to commemorate the 
50-year 
relationship 
between 
the 
United 
States and Qatar. 
In addition to serving as the Co-Chair of the 
Congressional Caucus on Qatar, I serve on 
both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and 
the House Armed Services Committee. I am 
grateful for the opportunity to work closely with 
Qatar both diplomatically and strategically. 
The United States established diplomatic re-
lations with Qatar following its independence 
from the United Kingdom in 1971. Officially, 
the beginning of diplomatic relations took 
place on March 19, 1972, when American dip-
lomat William Stoltzfus met with Qatari gov-
ernment officials and submitted his creden-
tials. Bilateral relations between the two coun-
tries expanded when the U.S. opened its em-
bassy in Doha in March 1973; and when the 
first resident U.S. Ambassador, Robert Peter 
Paganelli, arrived in July 1974. 
The United States and Qatar cooperate mili-
tarily and strategically on security in the re-
gion. One of the earliest and most notable 
military cooperation’s between the U.S. and 
Qatar was in 1991, when joint military oper-
ations were conducted against Saddam Hus-
sein’s Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. In 
the aftermath, both nations agreed upon the 
need for a Defense Cooperation Agreement. 
This pact, which has subsequently been ex-
panded, has served as the basis for our mili-
tary collaboration. 
In 1996, Qatar built Al Udeid Air Base to fur-
ther security ties between our countries. In 
1999, then Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad, told 
U.S. officials that he ‘‘would like to see as 
many as 10,000 U.S. servicemen permanently 
stationed at Al Udeid.’’ The U.S. first used the 
then-secret base in late September 2001, 
when the Air Force needed to get aircraft in 
position for its operations in Afghanistan. In 
April 2003, the U.S. Combat Air Operations 
Center for the Middle East moved from Prince 
Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia to Qatar, un-
derscoring the importance of Qatar to the 
American presence and objectives in the re-
gion. 
Al Udeid is now home to the largest U.S. 
military base in the Middle East and more no-
tably Qatar is not only allowing expansion of 
Al Udeid, but also funding it and managing the 
construction. In fact, the Qatari government 
has provided over $8 billion in funding for Al 
Udeid Air Base since 2003. After renovations 
and expansions, Al Udeid will be able to ac-
commodate up to 120 aircraft and 10,000 
troops, just like then Emir of Qatar, Sheikh 
Hamad had wished for. 
Personally, I am grateful that the U.S. Air 
Forces Central Command is headquartered at 
Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina and has 
a forward headquarters in Qatar. As the air 
component of CENTCOM, AFCENT is respon-
sible for air operations, either unilaterally or in 
concert with coalition partners, and for devel-
oping contingency plans in support of national 
objectives for CENTCOM’s 20-nation area of 
responsibility. 
Qatar has been an invaluable partner on 
several diplomatic fronts. Qatar quietly as-
sisted in ending the Israel-Hamas war in May 
2021 and continues to be helpful in seeking to 
improve Israeli relations with Palestinians. 
Qatar played a significant role in the evacu-
ation of more than 100,000 people from Af-
ghanistan after the disastrous withdrawal by 
the Biden Administration. Qatar facilitated vet-
ting of individuals seeking to leave the country 
and organized aspects of their departure. 
Many of the flights that enabled people to 
evacuate were by way of Qatari airlines. In ad-
dition, a large percentage of the new refugees 
were brought to Qatar, which arranged hous-
ing and other shelter for them as well as food, 
medicine and other provisions. At one point, 
the Qatari military was providing over 50,000 
meals per day to the newly arrived refugees. 
There are still thousands of Afghan refugees 
in Qatar, where they continue to receive much 
needed care and assistance. 
In addition to security and diplomatic rela-
tions, the United States and Qatar have exten-
sive economic ties. As Qatar’s largest foreign 
direct investor and its single largest source of 
imports, the United States has developed a ro-
bust trade relationship with Qatar, with over 
120 U.S companies operating in country. U.S. 
exports to Qatar increased by 47.7 percent 
from 2018 to 2019, totaling $6.5 billion in 
2019.

The United States is a leading equipment 
supplier and partner for Qatar’s oil and gas in-
dustry, and U.S. companies have played a 
significant role in the development of the oil 
and gas sector. In addition to energy, U.S. 
companies also export to Qatar’s defense, 
aviation, ICT, healthcare, food, and engineer-
ing/construction sectors. U.S. imports from 
Qatar include liquefied natural gas, aluminum, 
fertilizers, and sulfur. The United States and 
Qatar signed a trade and investment frame-
work agreement and participate in annual bi-
lateral Strategic Dialogues. 
I appreciate Qatar’s efforts to invest $45 bil-
lion in the United States, including large in-
vestments in South Carolina. Qatari firm 
Barzan is helping fund a facility in Charleston, 
South Carolina, adding an estimated 50,000 
American jobs. 
Major educational ties have been developed 
over the course of the fifty-year relationship. 
Annually, there are hundreds of Qatari stu-
dents studying in the United States and six 
U.S. universities have branch campuses in 
Qatar’s Education City complex. These Uni-
versities are Virginia Commonwealth Univer-
sity School of the Arts in Qatar, Weill Cornell 
Medical College in Qatar, Texas A&M Univer-
sity at Qatar, Carnegie Mellon University in 
Qatar, Georgetown University School of For-
eign Service in Qatar, and Northwestern Uni-
versity. 
In conclusion, over the course of the fifty- 
year relationship, the United States and Qatar 
have developed military and strategic ties, co-
operated on major diplomatic initiatives, en-
larged financial and economic relations, and 
supported educational advancement for stu-
dents in both countries. With that being said, 
the most important factor to consider is that 
two nations located in different regions of the 
world, with different histories and cultures 
have been able to forge an enduring and pros-
perous friendship based on many shared val-
ues. This will set the stage for the next fifty 
years and beyond.

TRIBUTE TO COURTNEY MORRIS— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 17, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Courtney 
Morris of Atwater Village, a unique neighbor-
hood of Los Angeles, California. 
Originally from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 
Ms. Morris received a Bachelor of Arts in Vis-
ual and Media Production from Emerson Col-
lege in Boston, Massachusetts. Since 2010, 
Ms. Morris has been a resident of California. 
While Ms. Morris has moved a few times over 
the past few years, she has remained within 
the same eight block area in and around 
Atwater Village. 
Ms. Morris served on the Atwater Village 
Neighborhood Council for four consecutive 
terms and was Board Co-Chair for nearly nine 
years. Passionate about community service 
and engagement, Ms. Morris was instrumental 
in organizing several events during her board 
tenure. She organized the Atwater Village Car 
Show and was part of the planning commit-
tees for the Equestrian District Open House, 
Movie Nights, Trick or Treat on the Boolevard, 
and Summer Nights on the Boulevard. 
Although Ms. Morris is no longer an Atwater 
Village Neighborhood Council board member, 
she continues to Co-Chair the Atwater Village 
Tree Lighting Committee and is also a mem-
ber of the Atwater Village Neighborhood 
Council Equine Committee. An avid animal 
lover, Ms. Morris often rescues cats and dogs 
and serves the Neighborhood Council as the 
Animal Services Liaison. 
When not volunteering in her community, 
Ms. Morris is part of the Warner Bros. Dis-
covery Talent Management Team. She has 
over ten years of experience in working with 
talent as a Casting Director for unscripted pro-
gramming and branded content. 
Ms. Morris is married to her husband, Mat-
thew Weil, and together they have a daughter, 
Isla, and four rescue dogs. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Courtney 
Morris.
