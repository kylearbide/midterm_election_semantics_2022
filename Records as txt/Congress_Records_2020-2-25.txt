f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
JOYCE) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania led the

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

RAISING AWARENESS OF THE IM-
PORTANCE 
OF 
THE 
UPCOMING 
CENSUS 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to a share story of the Ridley 
School District, which is leading the 
charge in our community to raise 
awareness of the importance of the up-
coming Census. 
Under 
the 
leadership 
of 
Kelli 
Mullany, the director of pupil services, 
the 
Ridley 
School 
District 
has 
launched a districtwide effort to ensure 
a complete and fair count in the 2020 
Census. 
Ten years ago, Pennsylvania under-
counted over 25,000 children, resulting 
in a loss of nearly $44 million in fund-
ing 
for 
critical 
programs 
like 
healthcare, SNAP, school lunches, af-
fordable housing, teacher training, and 
classroom technology. These programs 
were all impacted by the undercount. 
Since children are among those most 
likely to be undercounted, it is particu-
larly important for schools like Ridley 
to promote a complete Census count. 
Community 
leaders 
like 
Kelli 
are 
working hard alongside local churches, 
preschools, shelters, housing authori-
ties, public libraries and using social 
media to spread the word that we all 
count. 
The Census is the basis for how the 
Federal Government distributes bil-
lions of tax dollars, so we need a com-
plete count. Our children and our com-
munities 
can’t 
afford 
another 
undercount this year. We all need to 
spread the word that the Census is 
easy, safe, and important. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ANDREA DEVORRIS 
COHEN 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize An-
drea Devorris Cohen, a dedicated com-
munity leader whose work has bene-
fited the people of Blair County. 
As the president of Lakemont Park, 
Andrea has led the recent trans-
formation of this amusement park into 
a renewed recreational epicenter for 
our community. From new playgrounds 
and walking trails to batting cages and 
basketball courts, Lakemont Park has 
been restored to a beautiful facility 
where families and friends can gather 
together. 
A homegrown Altoona leader and the 
daughter of Nancy and Don Devorris, 
Andrea has spent her career working 
for our community and improving the 
quality of life in Blair County. This 
week, she will be honored by the Cen-
tral Blair Recreation and Park Com-
mission for her many contributions 
and achievements. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 13th 
Congressional 
District 
of 
Pennsyl-
vania, 
we 
thank 
Andrea 
Devorris 
Cohen for her leadership in the revital-
ization of this historic recreational 
center, as well as her continued service 
to our community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

February 25, 2020 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, February 25, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the 
permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II 
of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the Clerk received the following mes-
sage from the Secretary of the Senate on 
February 25, 2020, at 9:38 a.m.: 
That the Senate passed S. 995. 
With best wishes, I am 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON.

HONORING ROSA NACCARATO 
(Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I have spo-
ken in this Chamber before about my 
father’s American success story as an 
Italian immigrant. Today, I rise to tell 
the story of another Italian immigrant 
success story, the story of my constitu-
ent’s mother, Rosa Naccarato. 
Rosa died unexpectedly this past 
Christmas, only 2 weeks shy of her 95th 
birthday. 
In 1955, Rosa left Italy with her hus-
band and six children, leaving behind 
her friends and family, all in pursuit of 
the American Dream. Think of the 
tears that were shed as family and a 
way of life were left behind and as they 
faced the unknown. 
The Naccaratos arrived in America 
with only $200 in their pocket. They 
worked hard and experienced tremen-
dous hardships and personal affronts 
because they didn’t speak English. But 
they refused to believe that they were 
second-class citizens. 
They persevered, and their children 
all achieved tremendous success. Their 
son, 
Anthony 
Naccarato, 
my 
con-
stituent, was recently installed as the 
New York State president of the Sons 
and Daughters of Italy. 
Anthony asked me to speak up on be-
half of his mother and all immigrants 
who make the leap of faith to leave ev-
erything behind and come to America 
to try and live the American Dream. 
Hopefully, Rosa Naccarato’s story will 
inspire others to persevere through the 
hardships, the discrimination, and the 
outright disrespect. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we honor Rosa 
Naccarato. God bless her, and God bless 
the United States of America.

GOLD 
STAR 
SPOUSES 
AND 
SPOUSES OF INJURED SERVICE-
MEMBERS LEASING RELIEF EX-
PANSION ACT OF 2019 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2227) to amend the Service-
members Civil Relief Act to authorize 
spouses of servicemembers who incur a 
catastrophic injury or illness or die 
while in military service to terminate 
leases of premises and motor vehicles, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2227 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Gold Star 
Spouses 
and 
Spouses 
of 
Injured 
Servicemembers Leasing Relief Expansion 
Act of 2019’’. 
SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF TERMINATION OF 
LEASES OF PREMISES AND MOTOR 
VEHICLES 
OF 
SERVICEMEMBERS 
WHO INCUR CATASTROPHIC INJURY 
OR ILLNESS OR DIE WHILE IN MILI-
TARY SERVICE. 
(a) 
CATASTROPHIC
INJURIES
AND
ILL-
NESSES.—Paragraph (4) of section 305(a) of 
the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 
U.S.C. 3955(a)), as added by section 545 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92), is amended 
to read as follows: 
‘‘(4) CATASTROPHIC
INJURY
OR
ILLNESS
OF 
LESSEE.— 
‘‘(A) TERMINATION.—If the lessee on a lease 
described in subsection (b) incurs a cata-
strophic injury or illness during a period of 
military service or while performing covered 
service, during the one-year period beginning 
on the date on which the lessee incurs such 
injury or illness— 
‘‘(i) the lessee may terminate the lease; or 
‘‘(ii) in the case of a lessee who lacks the 
mental capacity to contract or to manage 
his or her own affairs (including disburse-
ment of funds without limitation) due to 
such injury or illness, the spouse or depend-
ent of the lessee may terminate the lease. 
‘‘(B) DEFINITIONS.—In this paragraph: 
‘‘(i) The term ‘catastrophic injury or ill-
ness’ has the meaning given that term in 
section 439(g) of title 37, United States Code. 
‘‘(ii) The term ‘covered service’ means full- 
time National Guard duty, active Guard and 
Reserve duty, or inactive-duty training (as 
such terms are defined in section 101(d) of 
title 10, United States Code)’’. 
(b) DEATHS.—Paragraph (3) of such section 
is amended by striking ‘‘The spouse of the 
lessee’’ and inserting ‘‘The spouse or depend-
ent of the lessee’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
2227, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2227, as amended, the Gold Star 
Spouses and Spouses of Injured Serv-
icemembers Leasing Relief Expansion 
Act of 2019. 
This bill was introduced by Rep-
resentative CHERI BUSTOS of Illinois. I 
thank her for her work with the com-
mittee. It expands on the work the 
committee did last Congress with Rep-
resentative BUSTOS
to improve the 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. 
This bill ensures that active and re-
serve component servicemembers and 
their spouses or dependents who are 
catastrophically injured while in serv-
ice to this Nation have the ability to 
break their home and vehicle leases up 
to a year after their injury so that the 
family can modify their living situa-
tion to what best suits their new needs. 
Servicemembers and families under-
go difficult life transitions because of 
catastrophic injuries. Families should 
have the flexibility to be at their serv-
icemember’s side during recovery and 
the ability to easily move closer to 
family, friends, or other support net-
works. 
Families 
dealing 
with 
the 
cata-
strophic injury of their loved ones 
should not have to worry about leases 
and cancellation fees. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is an out-
growth of the bill Mrs. BUSTOS led last 
Congress and was the suggestion of the 
Paralyzed Veterans of America. It also 
clarifies similar legislation that passed 
in the National Defense Authorization 
Act last year. 
H.R. 2227, as amended, would make it 
clear that catastrophically disabled 
servicemembers who have the mental 
capacity to terminate a lease may do 
so. It is not only spouses and depend-
ents who are protected by the Service-
members Civil Relief Act. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Dr. 
Wenstrup, a former member of this 
committee, for his focus on the issue

H1175 
February 25, 2020 
and for working with Mrs. BUSTOS on 
this bill. I also thank the Paralyzed 
Veterans of America for highlighting 
the need to include catastrophically 
disabled veterans and families in our 
work to improve the Servicemembers 
Civil Relief Act. 
Finally, I applaud the bipartisan 
work of Congressmen Levin and Bili-
rakis on this bill and their work on the 
Economic Opportunity Subcommittee. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
join me in voting for H.R. 2227, as 
amended. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 2227, as amended, the Gold 
Star Spouses and Spouses of Injured 
Servicemembers Leasing Relief Act of 
2019. 
This bill would build upon legislation 
enacted last Congress and in the fiscal 
year 2020 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act to amend the Servicemembers 
Civil Relief Act to allow a surviving 
spouse of a servicemember who died on 
active duty to terminate a property 
lease following the servicemember’s 
death. 
This bill would expand that allow-
ance to include motor vehicle leases 
and provide the same protection for 
spouses of servicemembers who are 
catastrophically injured in service. 
Madam Speaker, the last thing a hus-
band or wife should have to worry 
about 
when 
their 
servicemember 
spouse dies or is grievously injured in 
service to our country are late fees or 
penalties for terminating a lease for a 
car or property. Ensuring that they 
don’t have to is the very least we can 
do in exchange for their sacrifice. 
I thank my colleagues, Congress-
woman CHERI BUSTOS from Illinois, my 
friend Dr. BRAD WENSTRUP from Ohio, a 
fellow veteran and former senior com-
mittee member, as well as all the other 
Members of Congress who worked so 
hard on this bill in order to clarify 
these protections for these most de-
serving men and women. 
I encourage and urge all my col-
leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 
2227, as amended, 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers. I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Ohio 
(Mr. 
WENSTRUP), my good friend, and Iraq 
war veteran. I commend him on his 
work on this bill. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, it 
is a tragedy any time a United States 
servicemember is killed or gravely in-
jured in the line of duty. Those events, 
however, don’t happen in a vacuum. 
They have lasting impacts on that 
hero’s family and their loved ones. 
That is why I rise in support of this 
bill, H.R. 2227, which I introduced with 
Representative BUSTOS. Our legislation 
would give spouses and dependents of 
servicemembers who are killed or cata-
strophically injured in the line of duty 
the flexibility to move closer to family 
and friends for support, because no one 
enduring that type of life-altering 
event should go through it alone. 
In 2018, Representative BUSTOS and I 
worked together to pass the Gold Star 
Spouses Leasing Relief Act and get it 
signed into law. It gave Gold Star 
spouses the ability to terminate their 
property leases without penalty if their 
servicemember was killed in the line of 
duty. 
We expanded those protections to in-
clude auto leases, as well, in last year’s 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
Now, this bill builds upon the good 
work of those two efforts by extending 
those protections to dependents of 
servicemembers in addition to spouses. 
I thank Representative BUSTOS and 
the members of the House Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs for their work in 
bringing this important bill to the 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 2227. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
This takes me back to when I was in 
college in 1965, and my scout master 
was killed in Vietnam leaving behind 
four children. They were responsible 
for all these things with no resources, 
no money. I think our lives then were 
worth, at the most, if you bought extra 
insurance, $20,000, not much money. 
This is the right thing to do. I am 
sorry it took 50 years to get it done. I 
certainly appreciate all of my col-
leagues, especially my good friend Dr. 
WENSTRUP and Representative BUSTOS 
who brought this to our attention and 
got it done. 
I encourage all my colleagues to sup-
port this bill 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I associate myself with the remarks 
of the ranking member. A catastrophic 
medical 
condition 
associated 
with 
someone who has worn the uniform of 
our Nation in service of our Nation 
should not also be accompanied by his 
family or her family needing to worry 
about paying off a lease on a home or 
a car. 
The law of the United States should 
reflect the gratitude that the people 
have for a servicemember’s service to 
our country. This is the right thing to 
do, and I encourage all of my col-
leagues to, again, join me in passing 
H.R. 2227, as amended. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2227, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend the Serv-
icemembers Civil Relief Act to clarify 
the authority of servicemembers who 
incur a catastrophic injury or illness 
while in military service to terminate 
leases of premises and motor vehicles, 
and for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
4852. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4852, the G.I. and Veterans Edu-
cation Empowerment Act, also known 
as the GIVE Act. 
H.R. 4852, introduced by Representa-
tive TORRES, provides veterans with 
more information about educational 
institutions prior to their enrollment. 
Too often veterans find their edu-
cational institutions are not good fits 
for their educational goals and drop 
out or transfer to other institutions 
after wasting time and benefits. 
After 
transferring, 
veterans 
lose 
credits from their transferring institu-
tions or simply give up on acquiring a 
new skill set altogether because an in-
stitution does not meet their needs. 
Madam Speaker, the GIVE Act ad-
dresses an overlooked cause for vet-
erans dropping out or transferring to 
other institutions: cultural incongru-
ence. 
I have observed countless instances 
where veterans begin their studies only 
to find out that they are not com-
fortable on the campus of their edu-
cational institution. 
Congress created the GI Bill Com-
parison Tool to provide veterans with 
more information when they consider 
where they will pursue a postsecondary 
education. While the GI Bill Compari-
son Tool provides veterans with data 
on tuition and costs, accreditation, and 
cautionary information, there are gaps 
in the information regarding campus 
culture. 
For example, the GI Bill Comparison 
Tool does not inform a Catholic vet-
eran, who may be interested in attend-
ing a Catholic institution, if an institu-
tion is affiliated with the Roman 
Catholic Church. 
Madam Speaker, small pieces of in-
formation like that are critical to 
helping veterans assimilate to life on 
campus. 
Data on campus culture are collected 
by the Department of Education but 
are not currently displayed on the GI 
Bill Comparison Tool website. Now, if 
enacted, the GIVE Act will require VA 
to provide prospective student veterans 
with information on whether an insti-
tution is minority serving, gender spe-
cific, or has a religious affiliation. 
Madam Speaker, this bill will simply 
require the GI Bill Comparison Tool to 
display information to help veterans 
choose the right school the first time. 
b 1630 
This bill will also help veterans 
choose a campus that is aligned with 
their values and reduce the number of 
transfers due to cultural incompati-
bility. 
We owe it to our veterans to give 
them the most accurate and relevant 
information that will allow them to ef-
ficiently obtain a new skill set so they 
can reenter the labor force and find 
meaningful opportunities. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive TORRES for her work on this im-
portant issue. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 4852, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself as 
much time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 4852, the G.I. and Veterans 
Education Empowerment, or GIVE, 
Act. 
This bill would require the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs to provide ad-
ditional information on schools listed 
on the GI Bill Comparison Tool. The 
tool was first authorized by legislation 
sponsored by Congressman GUS BILI-
RAKIS from Florida, the ranking mem-
ber of the Subcommittee on Economic 
Opportunity, in 2013 to give service-
members and veterans the opportunity 
to compare information on GI Bill-eli-
gible 
schools 
to 
determine 
which 
school is right for them. 
The tool is modeled off the Depart-
ment of Education’s College Navigator 
website, which contains information 
about tuition and fee costs, policies on 
transferring credits, and whether an in-
stitution is private, nonprofit, or pub-
lic. 
H.R. 4852 would add three additional 
data points to the tool to ensure that it 
captures information about whether an 
institution is affiliated with a religion, 
serves a specific group of minorities, or 
is gender-specific. 
As the old saying goes, information 
is power. I am sure that this additional 
information will help GI Bill users 
choose the right school to fit their spe-
cific needs and, ultimately, ensure 
their success in higher education and 
beyond. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman NORMA TORRES from California 
for her work on this legislation, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, having used the GI 
Bill myself many, many years ago, it is 
an invaluable tool for our veterans. We 
know that the GI Bill was really one of 
the major things that helped create the 
America we live in today, as post- 
World War II veterans left, came out, 
used the GI Bill, went to college, and 
really helped create this great country 
we live in. 
Two years ago, we passed a bill that 
would make the GI Bill forever, so that 
if you lose your job when you are 45 
years old or 50 years old, if you are a 
veteran, you can go back and use that 
GI Bill to retrain and continue your 
education. 
This bill helps further clarify and 
helps veterans use that information 
better for themselves and their fami-
lies. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
again urge all of my colleagues to pass 
H.R. 4852. 
Our veterans deserve to have the 
most accurate information available to 
them as they are making their choices 
about the institutions where they 
would like to use their GI Bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4852. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
3749, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3749, as amended, the Legal Serv-
ices for Homeless Veterans Act. 
Over the past decade, Congress and 
the Obama and Trump administrations 
have prioritized ending veteran home-
lessness. However, while rates of vet-
eran homelessness have fallen, even 
one veteran without shelter is unac-
ceptable. 
This committee is committed to pro-
viding services to prevent homeless-
ness and to assist veterans who become 
homeless by providing them housing 
and access to healthcare and social 
services. 
According to the Project CHALENG, 
otherwise known as Community Home-
lessness Assessment, Local Education 
and Networking Groups, and VA sur-
vey, legal services are one of the top 
unmet needs for homeless veterans. 
H.R. 3749 directly addresses that need. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 3749, as amend-
ed, is sponsored by Congressman PA-
NETTA
and includes legislation au-
thored 
by 
Congresswoman 
BEATTY, 
Congresswoman WILD, and Congress-
man LEVIN. It authorizes VA to provide 
grants or enter into cooperative agree-
ments with eligible entities that pro-
vide legal services to homeless vet-
erans and veterans at risk for home-
lessness. 
The VA would be required to consult 
with organizations that have experi-
ence providing services to homeless 
veterans when establishing these cri-
teria and requirements, and these 
grants 
or 
cooperative 
agreements 
would only be available to highly rated 
public or nonprofit entities. 
Additionally, at least 10 percent of 
the funds made available each fiscal 
year for this grant program must be re-
served for providing legal services to 
homeless women veterans. As we know, 
women veterans are the fastest grow-
ing population of homeless veterans. 
Finally, this legislation authorizes 
$20 million of the funding for the Sup-
portive Services for Veteran Families 
grant program to go to organizations 
that assist homeless veterans with 
children. The SSVF program has been 
one of the most effective tools to ad-
dress veteran homelessness since its 
creation by President Obama, and I 
thank this administration and Con-
gress for supporting it. 
Madam Speaker, southern California 
is ground zero for addressing veteran 
homelessness. Riverside, California, in 
my own district, reached functional 
zero veteran homelessness, but many 
communities surrounding my district 
need additional resources and programs

to reach functional zero. Providing 
legal services to veterans who need 
them also prevents those veterans who 
are at risk of becoming homeless. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
man 
PANETTA, 
Congresswoman 
BEATTY, Congresswoman WILD, and 
Congressman LEVIN, the chair of our 
Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, 
for their advocacy and work to pass 
legislation that will end veteran home-
lessness. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support H.R. 3749, as 
amended, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself as 
much time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 3749, as amended, the 
Legal Services for Homeless Veterans 
Act. 
This bill would authorize a new legal 
services grant program for homeless 
veteran providers. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
would administer this grant program 
to organizations serving homeless vet-
erans that provide legal services for 
issues regarding housing, family mat-
ters, criminal defense, and upgrading 
military discharges. Grantees would 
provide these services to veterans who 
are or who are at risk of becoming 
homeless. 
This bill would also require that not 
less than 10 percent of grant funds go 
toward providing legal services for vet-
erans who are women. 
The committee’s oversight of the 
homeless program has found that sim-
ple legal services can be a barrier to re-
integration for the homeless or at-risk 
veterans because they can prevent 
them from gaining meaningful employ-
ment and stable housing. 
I believe that providing grants to 
homeless veteran providers that offer 
legal services to this vulnerable popu-
lation would be providing another ave-
nue for these veterans to appropriately 
work through their legal issues and, 
hopefully, move closer to independ-
ence. 
The bill would also direct $20 million 
from VA’s Supportive Services for Vet-
eran Families program to grantees 
that provide services specifically for 
homeless women veterans. 
It would further require an advanced 
study on what type of services are 
available for homeless women veterans 
and how to ensure these services are 
meeting their needs. 
While I am supportive of this new 
program grant as well as the steps the 
bill would take to help homeless 
women veterans, I am concerned that 
there is no limit to the amount of med-
ical service dollars that could be spent 
on this new program. I worry that if we 
continue to use the medical service ac-
count as a cash cow for new, unfunded 
priorities, 
other 
veteran 
programs 
eventually could be negatively im-
pacted. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA), my good 
friend and also the author of H.R. 3749, 
a veteran himself. 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman and ranking mem-
ber. I appreciate this opportunity to 
talk about something that both of 
these gentlemen have discussed and 
support. I appreciate that, so I thank 
the gentlemen very much. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in sup-
port as well of H.R. 3749, the Legal 
Services for Homeless Veterans Act. 
This is a bill that directs the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to provide 
grants to organizations that provide 
legal services to homeless veterans and 
veterans at risk for homelessness. 
The grant funds will be used to pro-
vide legal services related to housing, 
such as legal services related to family 
law; legal services related to income 
support; legal services related to crimi-
nal defense, including defense in mat-
ters symptomatic of homelessness; and 
legal services related to requests to up-
grade discharge characterizations. 
The legislation also authorizes appro-
priations of at least $20 million for ad-
ditional aid to women veterans experi-
encing housing instability and home-
lessness. As you heard from the chair-
man, women are the fastest growing 
group not just of homeless veterans but 
in the military and in our veterans’ 
communities. And, as you heard, they 
are more likely to be single parents. 
While serving as a local prosecutor, 
before my time here in Congress, in 
Monterey County, and working as a 
board member for the Veterans Transi-
tion Center of Monterey County, an or-
ganization which offers veterans not 
just 
transitional 
housing 
but, 
of 
course, case management programs to 
get them up on their feet and back into 
the communities where they can con-
tinue to serve, I worked firsthand with 
many veterans who had certain legal 
issues that brought them to the brink 
or pushed them right into, unfortu-
nately, homelessness. 
It is essential that Congress now en-
sure that our veterans are properly 
supported, have access to legal aid, 
and, yes, get the benefits that they 
have earned. We can then keep a roof 
over their heads. 
For veterans in my district and 
across this country, this bill will pro-
vide them aid that really can help 
them during such events as Veterans 
Stand Down, a biennial event that we 
have in our district that provides 
much-needed legal assistance and helps 
our community’s veterans get back on 
solid ground, be accepted into housing, 
drive legally, and make sure that they 
can find a job. 
Madam Speaker, as a former veteran, 
I do urge my colleagues to support my 
bill to provide veterans the resources 
necessary to help them resolve legal 
issues and get back on their feet so 
that they can get back to being an in-
tegral part of our community and, of 
course, our country. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, I thank the 
members of the For Country Caucus for 
endorsing this legislation. As a co- 
chair and founder of this caucus, the 
membership and I have worked to pro-
vide a platform for military veteran 
members to work across the aisle, to 
improve governance, and to enact pro-
ductive policy, just like we have done 
here. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have 
this bill introduced through the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, which I do 
believe does the exact same thing, and 
I thank both of these gentlemen for 
bringing this bill to the floor. 
b 1645 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
this bill and appreciate Mr. PANETTA’s 
leadership on it. 
When I got to Congress in 2009, there 
were over 100,000 homeless veterans in 
this country. That number has been re-
duced by 70 percent. And, as the chair-
man said, zero is the right number; 
that is the correct number of homeless 
veterans. 
This will go a long way to reestab-
lishing many other things that the 
committee has done to help this, but 
this is a major step in helping when 
you are trying to get legal services 
with a lease or with many other things, 
with family issues. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to support this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I want to echo the 
sentiment of my colleague, Ranking 
Member ROE. We have both said in pub-
lic and acknowledged the tremendous 
progress the VA has made in reducing 
homelessness. It began with the com-
mitment under President Obama and 
has been continued under President 
Trump. 
We have not done enough, I fear, to 
celebrate the tremendous reduction in 
homelessness across our country with 
respect to veteran homelessness. It 
still persists in my home State of Cali-
fornia. We have a number of initiatives 
teed up, which, I trust, we are going to 
cooperate on. 
The VA gets knocked around a lot for 
its shortcomings, but I have to say 
that this is one of the accomplishments 
that we have to celebrate more. 
Mr. PANETTA’s bill, H.R. 3749, is a 
continuation of this work. I urge all of 
my colleagues to join me in passing it, 
as amended, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3749, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
4613, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4613, as amended, which 
would require the posting of congres-
sionally mandated reports of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs on the 
Department’s public website. The VA 
Reporting Transparency Act, intro-
duced by Representatives ROSE
and 
CISNEROS, will ensure easy public ac-
cess to these reports. 
Surprisingly, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs does not currently pro-
vide public access to many of its re-
ports that are mandated by Congress. 
Rather than place its reports on its 
website, VA will often only transmit 
its reports to a few congressional com-
mittees, such as the House and Senate 
Committees on Veterans’ Affairs. By 
contrast, the VA Office of Inspector 
General posts its reports online within 
3 days of completion. 
This legislation would allow veterans 
and the public to access these reports 
online, which contain critical informa-
tion about agency activities and the ef-
fectiveness of services. 
It would also improve accountability. 
For example, in 2019, VA provided re-
ports to Congress on the activity of the 
Office of Accountability and Whistle-
blower Protection and on veterans 
being the target of Social Security 
fraud. 
Americans should know what actions 
the VA should be taking to protect VA 
whistleblowers and what VA has done 
to prevent the fraudulent use of vet-
erans’ Social Security numbers. These

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1180 
February 25, 2020 
reports contain valuable information 
that should be made available to the 
public. 
Madam Speaker, the bill is supported 
by the American Legion, Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, and Disabled American 
Veterans. I urge all of my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4613, as amended, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4613, as amended, the VA 
Reporting Transparency Act. This bill 
would require the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs to make all of VA’s con-
gressionally mandated reports avail-
able on the Department’s website. 
During the committee markup on 
this bill, I registered my concern that 
this bill had not gone through regular 
order. Congress has not, to my knowl-
edge, required any other Federal agen-
cy to publish congressionally mandated 
reports. 
The concept of making congression-
ally mandated reports available is not, 
on its face, objectionable. However, we 
cannot always see the downstream con-
sequences of a policy. 
When the committee holds legisla-
tive hearings, we get an outside per-
spective on legislation from important 
stakeholders and can identify problems 
or potential enhancements that may 
not be readily apparent to lawmakers. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to reit-
erate that our committee’s work—and, 
by extension, our Nation’s veterans— 
benefits from regular order, and I urge 
our committee to return to it. 
That said, I thank the chairman for 
supporting an amendment I offered 
during the markup of this bill to ad-
dress three concerns I had: 
First, my amendment clarified that 
the requirement for VA to post reports 
would apply prospectively in order to 
avoid requiring VA to publish past re-
ports. 
Second, my amendment gave Con-
gress 30 days to review the report be-
fore VA publishes it on the website. 
The Government Accountability Office 
gives us such a courtesy to review, and 
I believe the same courtesy is appro-
priate here. 
Finally, 
my 
amendment 
clarified 
that Congress can, at the time of man-
dating the report, exempt it from pub-
lication. I was concerned that, as writ-
ten, it was unclear when a report could 
be withheld, and I wanted the Congress 
mandating the report to make that de-
cision. 
With those changes, I believe the bill 
will result in a more transparent and 
publicly accessible VA. I encourage my 
colleagues to join me in supporting it, 
as amended, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ROSE), my good friend 
and member of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, and also a member of the 
Oversight 
and 
Investigations 
Sub-
committee and author of H.R. 4613. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman TAKANO for 
his extraordinary leadership and this 
opportunity, and I thank the gen-
tleman from Tennessee, Ranking Mem-
ber ROE, for always putting veterans 
first. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4613, 
the VA Reporting Transparency Act. 
As my fellow veterans know, the VA 
is unparalleled in its commitment to 
serving our veterans, and that goes 
from our nurses to our physician as-
sistants, our doctors, our VA police of-
ficers, and many other folks, veterans, 
themselves, who spend each and every 
day working at the VA. That certainly 
holds true for the VA in my district, 
New York’s 11th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
But 
for 
the 
largest 
integrated 
healthcare system in the United States 
and for an agency that holds the lives 
of our Nation’s heroes in their hands, 
we must ensure accountability. Let’s 
be very clear: There is no account-
ability without transparency. 
When Congress mandates that the 
VA produce reports on the staffing lev-
els of their nurses or how the VA pre-
vents fraud, waste, and abuse or how 
the Office of Accountability and Whis-
tleblower Protection truly keeps our 
VA employees safe, this information is 
useless if it is not made available to 
the general public in an accessible 
manner. 
It is valuable to the nearly 9 million 
veterans enrolled in VA healthcare, 
and it is valuable to every American 
who wants to make sure that their tax 
dollars are being used for the best pos-
sible care that our veterans deserve. 
That is exactly why I introduced this 
bill, the VA Reporting Transparency 
Act, which requires that the VA have 
public access to the legislatively re-
quested reports that they produce. This 
access must be free, without any reg-
istration or limitations required, and 
the report must be posted no later than 
45 days after it is submitted. 
This is a no-brainer. It is common 
sense. It is an opportunity for the VA 
to set a precedent that other Federal 
departments will follow. 
We made a promise to our soldiers 
that, when they came home, we would 
be there for them. This bill is a perfect 
case in point for how we can do just 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank my colleagues on the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, Congressman 
GIL CISNEROS from California and Con-
gressman GREG STEUBE, a fellow Army 
vet, for their support of this legisla-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
You heard the old saying that the 
best disinfectant in the world is sun-
shine, and I could not agree more with 
that. I appreciate my colleague, Con-
gressman ROSE
from New York, for 
bringing this legislation forward. I 
think it will allow everyone to see the 
reports that we see in a timely fashion. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to support it, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
passing H.R. 4613, as amended, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4613, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
PROTECTING BUSINESS OPPORTU-
NITIES FOR VETERANS ACT OF 
2019 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 561) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to improve the oversight 
of contracts awarded by the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to small business 
concerns owned and controlled by vet-
erans, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

CON-
TROLLED BY VETERANS.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 561, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 561, as amend-
ed, the Protecting Business Opportuni-
ties for Veterans Act of 2019, is spon-
sored by General BERGMAN and Con-
gresswoman KUSTER. It establishes im-
portant oversight for VA small busi-
ness contracting. 
Under current law, a small business 
contractor cannot give a subcontractor 
more than 50 percent of its contract 
work. The legislation requires veteran- 
and 
service-disabled 
veteran-owned 
small businesses to certify that they 
are performing at least half of the 
work. It also requires VA to refer con-
tractors violating or suspected of vio-
lating the law to the VA Inspector 
General for investigation. 
Madam Speaker, in addition, the leg-
islation establishes an oversight proc-
ess 
and 
penalties 
for 
fraudulently 
claiming to comply with the law. 
Congress strongly supports creating 
business 
opportunities 
for 
veteran- 
owned small businesses and enforcing 
government contracting set-asides so 
that veteran-owned and service-dis-
abled veteran-owned businesses can 
compete with larger government con-
tractors. 
It is unfair to veteran small business 
owners who play by the rules to lose 
out on business opportunities to bad 
actors who do not follow the rules and 
pass on most of the work to sub-
contractors, especially when those sub-
contractors are not veteran owned. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is sup-
ported by the American Legion. Last 
Congress, the House passed identical 
legislation sponsored by my colleagues, 
General BERGMAN and Congresswoman 
KUSTER. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 561, as amend-
ed, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1715 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 561, as amended, the Pro-
tecting Business Opportunities for Vet-
erans Act. 
H.R. 561, as amended, is contracting 
reform legislation sponsored by my 
good friend, Lieutenant General JACK 
BERGMAN from Michigan, who is the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Oversight and Investigations. 
This bill would give the Department 
of Veterans Affairs and the Office of In-
spector General badly needed tools to 
stop 
companies 
that 
exploit 
con-
tracting loopholes to take work from 
legitimate veteran-owned small busi-
nesses. It is crucial that the Federal 
procurement be fair and that veteran 
entrepreneurs 
actually 
receive 
the 
business opportunities that the law 
created for them. 
Unfortunately, there have long been 
some 
fly-by-night 
small 
businesses 
that obtain set-aside contracts only to 
pass on all of the work to large busi-
nesses while collecting the profits. This 
is illegal, but the law is difficult to en-
force. 
This legislation requires a written 
certification in every contract proposal 
that the company will comply with the 
law. A false statement constitutes 
fraud, and the bill makes it the Inspec-
tor General’s explicit responsibility to 
investigate such suspected fraud. 
This bill is a smart fix for a difficult 
problem, and I appreciate General 
BERGMAN as well as Dr. NEAL DUNN of 
Florida, my good friend and the rank-
ing member of the Subcommittee on 
Health; 
and 
Congresswoman 
ANN 
KUSTER of New Hampshire for their 
work on it going back several years. I 
urge all Members to support H.R. 561, 
as amended. 
Lieutenant General JACK BERGMAN is 
my 
good 
friend. 
I 
think 
General 
BERGMAN is the highest-ranking vet-
eran in the U.S. Congress in either the 
House or the Senate. He represents the 
Upper Peninsula in Michigan and has 
been a great member of the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
BERGMAN). 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
give special thanks to the chairman 
and ranking member of the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee because we are here 
for the right reasons, and that is to 
serve veterans and enable them to be 
productive in their lives after their 
service to our country. 
My bill, H.R. 561, the Protecting 
Business Opportunities for Veterans 
Act, gives the VA the tools it needs to 
fix a persistent problem in contracting 
that is labeled improper passthroughs. 
These abuses occur when a small busi-
ness obtains a contract under set-aside 
award conditions, but gives all, or sub-
stantially all, of the work to a large 
company while collecting profit for 
doing absolutely nothing. This practice 
has long been prohibited by law and 
wastes taxpayer dollars, but, unfortu-
nately, in reality, agencies up until 
this point have had little ability to 
stop it. 
As a veteran and a small business 
owner myself, I know how much work 
and dedication goes into building a suc-
cessful company. The VA provides un-
paralleled opportunities for veteran- 
owned small businesses, but these op-
portunities are, unfortunately, wasted 
when unethical companies exploit loop-
holes to rip off the American taxpayer. 
I am very proud of VA’s Vets First 
Program 
which 
directed 
contracts 
worth $6.3 billion to veteran-owned 
small businesses last year alone. How-
ever, bad actors have been taking away 
contracts from law-abiding veteran 
business owners in the Vets First Pro-
gram for way too long. 
My bill, the Protecting Business Op-
portunities for Veterans Act, requires 
all bidders on these contracts to certify 
that they will perform the percentage 
of work that the law already requires. 
The bill also directs the VA to work 
with the Office of the Inspector Gen-
eral in a more effective way to find, 
stop, and, where appropriate, punish 
these improper passthroughs. 
H.R. 561 addresses the gaps in imple-
mentation of existing law without add-
ing new bureaucracy at the VA. I re-
peat: no additional new bureaucracy at 
the VA. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all 
my colleagues to support H.R. 561.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1182 
February 25, 2020 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, just for the record, a 
lieutenant general, in case there are 
those who don’t know what that is, has 
three stars. I salute this marine. Even 
though I was in the Army, I have to sa-
lute the general over here. 
Before I close in support of this bill, 
Madam Speaker, I want to express my 
disappointment that we are not consid-
ering another bill, S. 3084, this after-
noon as well. 
S. 3084 would correct a technical 
error in current law that unless swiftly 
addressed will jeopardize the financial 
security of certain current and former 
senior leaders across the VA healthcare 
system and make it harder for VA to 
recruit and retain the necessary talent 
to serve our Nation’s veterans. 
In short, a provision of the Care-
givers and Veterans Omnibus Health 
Services Act of 2010—and I remember 
that—is intended to raise the salary 
cap for employees serving our senior 
executive services-equivalent positions 
in the Veterans Health Administration. 
However, due to a recently realized 
error in the law, VA will have to cut 
pay and issue debts for 30 current and 
10 former senior leaders in those posi-
tions unless Congress acts to make the 
necessary corrections which S. 3084 will 
do. 
This was no fault of the Members. All 
of the employees who are impacted by 
this technical error serve in high-level, 
mission-critical 
leadership 
positions 
working on issues like suicide preven-
tion, mental health, women’s health, 
and more. We should be encouraging 
and supporting these leaders, not leav-
ing them in limbo. 
What is more, our failure to address 
this issue in a timely manner is ac-
tively making it harder for VA to re-
cruit candidates to fill important va-
cancies across the country. 
Madam Speaker, S. 3084 passed the 
Senate on January 16. We could have 
taken it up and passed it many times 
over by now. If we had, those leaders 
would be resting a lot easier, and those 
vacancies could have been filled. I urge 
Speaker PELOSI and Chairman TAKANO 
not to delay any longer and to schedule 
S. 3084 for floor time as soon as pos-
sible. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairman TAKANO for his leadership on 
all these bills we brought here. They 
are all very needed, and I appreciate 
the gentleman bringing them up in a 
timely fashion. I absolutely endorse all 
of those today, and I encourage my col-
leagues to support H.R. 561, as amend-
ed. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, I want to reiterate my support 
for H.R. 561. I want to appreciate the 
work with the minority. We have 
worked together to pass these five 
pieces of legislation on the floor. It is 
another demonstration of our commit-
ment to put veterans above partisan-
ship and to put the interests of Amer-
ica above partisanship. 
Madam Speaker, I can’t tell you 
what a privilege it is to chair this com-
mittee. I urge all my colleagues to pass 
H.R. 561, as amended, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 561, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
UKRAINE—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–102) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, with re-
spect to Ukraine is to continue in ef-
fect beyond March 6, 2020. 
The actions and policies of persons 
that undermine democratic processes 
and institutions in Ukraine; threaten 
its 
peace, 
security, 
stability, 
sov-
ereignty, and territorial integrity; and 
contribute to the misappropriation of 
its assets, and the actions and policies 
of the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration, including its purported annex-
ation of Crimea and its use of force in 
Ukraine, continue to pose an unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the na-
tional security and foreign policy of 
the United States. Therefore, I have de-
termined that it is necessary to con-
tinue the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 13660 with respect 
to Ukraine.

FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–103) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
GARCIA of Texas) laid before the House 
the following message from the Presi-
dent of the United States; which was 
read and, together with the accom-
panying papers, referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs and ordered 
to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Cuba 
that was declared on March 1, 1996, in 
Proclamation 6867, as amended by 
Proclamation 7757 on February 26, 2004, 
Proclamation 9398 on February 24, 2016, 
and Proclamation 9699 on February 22, 
2018, is to continue in effect beyond 
March 1, 2020. 
It continues to be United States pol-
icy that a mass migration from Cuba 
would endanger the security of the 
United States by posing a disturbance 
or threatened disturbance of the inter-
national relations of the United States. 
The Cuban government has not dem-
onstrated that it will refrain from the 
use of excessive force against United 
States vessels or aircraft that may en-
gage in memorial activities or peaceful 
protest north of Cuba. Further, the un-
authorized entry of United States-reg-
istered vessels into Cuban territorial 
waters continues to be detrimental to 
United 
States 
foreign 
policy 
and 
counter to the purpose of Executive 
Order 12807 of May 24, 1992, which is to 
ensure, among other things, safe, or-
derly, and legal migration. The possi-
bility of large-scale unauthorized en-
tries of United States-registered ves-
sels would disturb the international re-
lations of the United States by facili-
tating a possible mass migration of 
Cuban nationals. For these reasons, I 
have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency de-
clared with respect to Cuba and the 
emergency authority relating to the 
regulation of the anchorage and move-
ment of vessels set out in Proclama-
tion 6867, as amended by Proclamation 
7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proclama-
tion 9699.

February 25, 2020 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GALLAGHER) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I 
want to talk today about infrastruc-
ture, and I start with the confession 
that I was lied to as a child. In fact, my 
whole generation was lied to. We were 
told time and again by nearly every fu-
turistic TV show or movie that by now 
we would all be traveling around on 
jetpacks and hoverboards. But we are 
still waiting. 
And while we wait, we have to grap-
ple with the fact that we need to use 
roads wherever we are going and that 
our outdated infrastructure is nowhere 
near where it needs to be. 
b 1715 
Few issues we debate here in Wash-
ington, D.C., impact the day-to-day 
lives of our constituents more directly 
than infrastructure. Yet, fixing our in-
frastructure has become a running 
joke, with seemingly every week deri-
sively dubbed infrastructure week. 
It may be infrastructure week this 
week. We don’t know. But infrastruc-
ture should not be an afterthought or a 
back-burner priority we deal with only 
when we have more money—which we 
don’t—or when we are in a true infra-
structure crisis. Even in December’s 
$1.4 trillion spending deal, in which 
seemingly every lobbyist in D.C. got a 
Christmas present, infrastructure was 
largely ignored. 
Yet, infrastructure should not be im-
possible to tackle. Even as progress on 
a comprehensive package has eluded 
Congress in recent years, we have gen-
erated important bipartisan wins, like 
the 2-year Coast Guard reauthorization 
and reforms to better utilize the harbor 
maintenance trust fund to support crit-
ical projects at ports nationwide. There 
are plenty more easy bipartisan wins 
waiting on the sidelines—such as the 
Safe Routes Act, the Motorcyclist Ad-
visory Council Reauthorization Act, 
and the Promoting Women in Trucking 
Workforce Act—that we could pass in 
the House tomorrow and make our 
roads safer and grow our workforce in 
key industries. 
I know these are small fixes that will 
not solve all of America’s infrastruc-
ture needs, but they would represent 
tangible progress in a divided Congress 
that would improve transportation in 
communities like mine in northeast 
Wisconsin. But we can’t be content to 
stop there. 
Even though now, in the midst of the 
craziness that comes with the Presi-
dential election cycle, it is hard to 
imagine a comprehensive infrastruc-
ture bill passing both the House and 
the Senate, I think we should all agree 
that does not mean we should punt on 
thinking through more systemic infra-
structure issues. 
As we consider how the Federal Gov-
ernment can best support States, set 
national standards, and promote infra-
structure, there are three principles 
that we should keep in mind. 
First, we need to better understand 
where Federal money goes. Before 
spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, 
Congress needs to understand where 
and how Federal money is being spent. 
You may ask yourself: Don’t we al-
ready know that? No, unfortunately, 
we have shockingly little definitive in-
formation about America’s infrastruc-
ture needs and how much they cost. 
Given this opacity, it is no wonder 
that we often see huge, exorbitant fig-
ures quoted for infrastructure costs. 
For instance, right now, there is no de-
finitive estimate of the cost difference 
in building a highway with Federal as 
opposed to non-Federal dollars. This 
should not be difficult to determine. 
All it takes is finding projects of simi-
lar design and geography and com-
paring them. 
Any Wisconsin family would compare 
relative costs before a big construction 
project. Why should the Federal Gov-
ernment be any different? 
The problem is that what little top- 
line information we have on highways 
is based on data from 2007 to 2014. Now, 
the Federal Highway Administration 
reports only on what Congress has 
asked them to report. Up until now, 
that has not included cost analysis on 
highway projects. This has to change. 
Congress should require the Depart-
ment of Transportation to compare the 
costs of projects that use Federal funds 
and those that don’t. We should know 
the breakdown of costs for planning 
and design, materials, labor, and com-
pliance to understand how to better 
protect taxpayer money. 
We should also require the Depart-
ment to compare States so we can see 
which States are more efficient and 
figure out why they are more efficient. 
What is more, we need up-to-date 
data on the comparative health of in-
frastructure across the country. Out-
side groups can provide a valuable per-
spective, but it is our responsibility as 
Congress to ensure we have validated, 
independent 
data 
from 
the 
States 
themselves. 
For instance, we frequently hear that 
America has earned a D-plus grade on 
infrastructure. That is pretty bad. 
That is a failing grade on infrastruc-
ture, but compared to what standard 
and to what other country? We should 
have quantifiable comparisons to other 
developed nations. Are we getting rel-
ative bang for our buck compared to 
the U.K. or Canada? It is an open ques-
tion. The answers might help us find 
efficiencies and new ideas for infra-
structure partnerships. 
China may have high-speed trains in 
its coastal cities, but they built them 
without respect to property rights or 
the environment. What is their return 
on investment? Does China have a plan 
to maintain their system as it decays 
in coming decades? 
Unless we have reliable comparisons 
with peer nations, ratings that find 
America has a D-plus in infrastructure 
lack context, lack meaning, and, there-
fore, lack all analytical value. 
Before we try to prescribe solutions 
to our infrastructure challenges, we 
need to get useful, validated data to 
help us diagnose our problems. 
Data is coming to define the modern 
economy—not jet packs, but data. 
Therefore, we should be able to fix this 
stuff. Yet, when it comes to the very 
engine that literally helps drive our 
economy from one location to another, 
we are stuck in the 20th century or 
even earlier when it comes to meas-
uring need, progress, and required re-
sources. 
We have to do better before we sign 
up for potentially hundreds of billions 
of dollars in projects. 
The second principle is that we need 
to recognize it is not how much money 
we spend on infrastructure but how 
that money is spent. One of the funda-
mental flaws in our infrastructure pol-
icy is that we tend to be enamored 
with shiny new projects while paying 
less attention to how we maintain ex-
isting roads, bridges, and ports. 
The incentives make sense, right? 
Everyone wants to be there at the rib-
bon-cutting for a brand-new project, 
building something new. No one wants 
to be there at the much less exciting 
and non-ribbon-cutting ceremony for 
maintenance we are doing on roads 
every single day. 
But the Department of Transpor-
tation’s 2019 report to Congress on the 
status 
of 
the 
Nation’s 
highways, 
bridges, and transit noted that nearly 
60 percent of Federal money spent on 
highway infrastructure goes to reha-
bilitating our existing system. Al-
though that sounds substantial, we 
should remember that the siren call of 
infrastructure spending in Washington 
is predicated on fixing our crumbling 
infrastructure. 
If this is the case, then why is Con-
gress not dedicating more resources to 
maintenance? If we truly want to fix 
our crumbling infrastructure, then any 
future infrastructure package must 
consider the long-term effect of defer-
ring maintenance of existing projects 
for new construction. 
For example, the foundations under-
neath many of Wisconsin’s roads were 
laid in the 1960s and 1970s and are near-
ing the end of their lifespans. That 
means that, in some cases, the founda-
tion of Wisconsin’s roads predates 
Vince Lombardi’s victories in Super 
Bowl I and II. 
So why hasn’t this been addressed 
over the years, particularly in the 2009 
stimulus, which spent over $100 billion 
on infrastructure? Rather than focus-
ing on renewing existing roads, the 
stimulus bill prioritized Federal dol-
lars for ‘‘shovel-ready projects,’’ which 
tend to be new highways, interchanges, 
and frontage roads. So, despite receiv-
ing almost $400 million in highway 
funds from the 2009 stimulus, Wiscon-
sin’s roads are still limping along with 
aging foundations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1184 
February 25, 2020 
Consider that in a recent report on 
repair priorities, Transportation for 
America and Taxpayers for Common 
Sense found that even after the stim-
ulus, ‘‘The percentage of roads nation-
wide in poor condition increased from 
2009 to 2017.’’ 
After we spent hundreds of billions of 
dollars on infrastructure, the percent-
age of roads nationwide in poor condi-
tion increased. That should tell you 
something 
is 
fundamentally 
wrong 
with our approach. 
Strong Towns, an infrastructure re-
siliency organization, has argued for 
years that governments need to con-
sider roads as liabilities, not assets, be-
cause they eventually must be replaced 
for large sums of money. 
Yet, from 2009 to 2017, we collectively 
built 223,000 miles of new roads, enough 
new lane-miles to crisscross the entire 
country 83 times, which Repair Prior-
ities estimates will cost another $5 bil-
lion a year just to keep in good condi-
tion. Think about this: $5 billion is 
about 11 percent of the current size of 
Federal highway spending. 
As Strong Towns asks, if we devoted 
100 percent of all government spending 
to repair, would we even have enough 
to maintain what we have already 
built? Probably not. Yet, States, with 
Federal dollars, are building more. 
The principle here is that growth of 
the system creates a future cost to the 
system, which explains much of our 
current infrastructure funding crisis. 
Third, and finally, we need to think 
innovatively about the Federal role in 
infrastructure. I often hear that our in-
frastructure spending and programs are 
stuck in the 1950s. If this is true, then 
we need to make sure that our infra-
structure proposals aren’t rehashing 
spending and regulatory regimes from 
the 1950s. If we keep putting the same 
broken inputs into the system, we can 
expect the same broken result. 
The most obvious place to start is 
funding. We can’t just raise the gas tax 
and throw hundreds of billions of dol-
lars at the problem. That is particu-
larly true if we don’t have basic data 
on the scale of the problem. That is a 
1950s way of thinking. 
Even 
beyond 
the 
Committee 
on 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure’s 
Ranking Member SAM GRAVES’ call for 
proposals transitioning to a vehicle- 
miles traveled tax, there are plenty of 
ways that we can think innovatively 
and escape the prison of the past. 
One place to look is the permitting 
process. Countless billions of dollars 
are wasted in delays and ridiculous 
budget overruns caused by a regulatory 
maze of permitting. 
The potential for savings here is tre-
mendous. For example, The New York 
Times recently reported that it costs 
the city of New York nearly seven 
times the cost to build a rail project 
than similar projects almost any-
where—seven times. When considering 
that just the first phase of the Second 
Avenue Subway costs $4.5 billion, even 
savings of 25 percent would be enor-
mous. There are enormous savings to 
be found in cutting down on delays and 
budget overruns. 
President Trump’s Executive Order 
No. 13807 streamlines the permitting 
process by designating one Federal 
agency as the lead rather than forcing 
project managers to navigate through 
a dozen agencies. This should be codi-
fied into law. 
We also need commonsense reforms, 
like limiting the length of environ-
mental impact statements to 150 pages, 
with a time limit of 2 years for their 
completion. It should not take 10 years 
to do an environmental review, and no 
human being is going to read a 3,000- 
page technical document. We hurt our 
environment more by dragging the per-
mitting process out for years while 
more and more cars pile up in traffic. 
Another innovative idea comes from 
our Australian allies. I am proud to 
chair the Friends of Australia Caucus 
with my good, Democrat friend, JOE 
COURTNEY. In 2014, Australia launched 
an Asset Recycling Initiative, a 5-year 
program that set aside $3.3 billion in 
federal funding, which states could ac-
cess if they sold or leased underutilized 
public assets to private firms. Money 
generated from sales or leasing was 
then 
reinvested 
into 
infrastructure 
projects at the state level. If states 
met certain criteria, the federal gov-
ernment would then match those reve-
nues with an additional 15 percent. 
Under asset recycling, the untapped 
value of America’s underutilized infra-
structure could be recaptured and then 
recycled into other urgent infrastruc-
ture needs. Our Nation has more infra-
structure than any other nation, in-
cluding China. Consequently, we have 
perhaps untold billions in value frozen 
in underutilized assets. Leasing or sell-
ing these assets to private firms would 
not only free up that value but also 
transfer the maintenance costs to pri-
vate industry. 
The potential benefits of this concept 
are enormous, especially if leveraged 
toward maintenance and repair of our 
existing system. In fact, the Trump ad-
ministration championed this idea by 
proposing a Federal Incentives Pro-
gram, setting aside $100 billion to be 
granted to States and localities that 
could meet the criteria of asset recy-
cling. The Trump plan proposed a 20 
percent Federal match—even higher 
than Australia’s 15 percent. 
This was a promising idea that 
should not simply vanish because infra-
structure talks broke down last year 
between the Speaker and the Presi-
dent. Since the essential problem in in-
frastructure is how to pay for it, the 
Committee on Transportation and In-
frastructure should include programs 
exactly like these in a future infra-
structure package. 
b 1730 
Now, I will close shortly. I can see 
my colleagues who are working on the 
modernization of Congress, which is es-
sential to fixing the problems I am 
identifying, are waiting to speak. 
But I will close by saying that I am 
a huge student and fan of Dwight Ei-
senhower. I spent 3 months of my life 
in Abilene, Kansas, staying at the Holi-
day Inn Express, doing research there— 
very exciting for a man in his twenties. 
But I like Ike, and I believe, like Ike, 
that the Federal Government has a 
role to play in infrastructure. 
During the Eisenhower administra-
tion, in partnership with Canada, the 
United States built the Saint Lawrence 
Seaway. His most ambitious domestic 
project, the interstate highway pro-
gram, created a 41,000-mile road sys-
tem. 
When I look at Wisconsin, I see the 
impact that world-class infrastructure 
has had in keeping us economically 
competitive, so there should be no 
doubt that we need infrastructure. 
There should also be no doubt that 
the current way of delivering, funding, 
and planning for infrastructure is not 
working. It is time to bring the way we 
think about infrastructure into the 
21st century. 
By focusing on infrastructure trans-
parency and reporting, by repairing 
what we have first before constructing 
anew, and by innovating the way we 
fund and construct infrastructure, we 
can finally build a sustainable 21st cen-
tury foundation across the Nation, 
even as we await the coming of 
hoverboards and jetpacks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-

There was no objection. 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak about the work of the

As chair, I am extremely proud of 
what the select committee has accom-
plished in the past year. I am also 
proud of how we have accomplished our

In addition to unanimously passing 
45 recommendations to improve the 
way Congress works, the select com-
mittee is establishing a new and mean-
ingful precedent for bipartisan collabo-
ration.

the aisle to sit down together, engage 
in tough discussions, listen and learn 
from one another, and reach consensus. 
And I am fortunate and grateful to 
serve on this committee with such 
thoughtful and dedicated Members, in-
cluding Vice Chair TOM GRAVES, whom 
we will hear from later this evening. 
The select committee’s guiding prin-
ciple is to make Congress work better 
so that the institution and its Members 
can better serve the American people. 
That simple but profound goal guides 
all of our work. It helps us identify in-
stitutional problems and develop help-
ful solutions. 
Last year, we held hearings on im-
portant topics like improving trans-
parency in Congress, bettering con-
stituent engagement, cultivating staff 
diversity and retention, developing 
next-generation leadership, technology 
best practices used in the States, the 
congressional schedule and calendar, 
and rules and procedures. 
We kicked off this year with two 
hearings on Article I of the Constitu-
tion. The first focused on restoring 
congressional capacity, and the second 
focused on debate and deliberation. 
While this may not have set any rat-
ings records on C–SPAN, the reality is 
these hearings actually helped us dig 
deeper into the many challenges facing 
Congress and helped us identify innova-
tive solutions to have this institution 
function better on behalf of the Amer-
ican people. As we continue to examine 
the range of issues in our mandate, we 
are going to continue to listen closely 
to what our colleagues and staff have 
to say about making Congress work 
better for the American people. 
Many Members and staff have gener-
ously devoted their time and knowl-
edge to helping the select committee 
think about policies to modernize Con-
gress. We are grateful for their support 
and thrilled by the amount of interest 
our House colleagues have expressed in 
our work. 
If one thing is clear, it is this: The 
desire to make Congress a more effec-
tive and efficient institution is actu-
ally devoid of partisanship. Modern-
izing Congress helps all Members to do 
a better job on behalf of their constitu-
ents. 
So far, the select committee has re-
ported three sets of recommendations 
containing a total of 45 unanimously 
approved recommendations out of com-
mittee. The committee reports con-
taining these recommendations were 
reported to the House today, pursuant 
to section 201(f)(2) of H. Res. 6, and will 
be 
made 
publicly 
available 
at 
govinfo.gov. 
Our first set of recommendations was 
reported favorably by the select com-
mittee last May and focused on im-
proving 
transparency 
in 
Congress. 
Transparency increases accountability 
and, ultimately, improves the way Con-
gress serves the American people. 
While a lot of legislative information 
is public, it is often not made available 
in a format that is easy to access or to 
review 
or 
to 
digest. 
These 
rec-
ommendations 
address 
transparency 
and accessibility problems and encour-
age the continuous public posting of 
new legislative information, including 
bill status, committee votes, program 
authorizations, and lobbying disclo-
sures. 
Ultimately, it is the people who pay 
for the data Congress collects, so they 
should be able to access basic informa-
tion about what Members of Congress 
do here, whether it is following a bill 
through the process, seeing how we 
vote in committee and on the floor, or 
tracking what bills Members of Con-
gress sponsor and cosponsor. Improving 
public access to legislative data is 
wholly consistent with making Con-
gress work better for the American 
people. 
Our second set of 24 recommenda-
tions were reported favorably by the 
committee 
last 
July. 
These 
rec-
ommendations fit into four broad cat-
egories. 
The first set updates policies gov-
erning House human resources and con-
solidates the many H.R.-related offices 
in the House into a one-stop shop to 
help Members and staff with questions 
about recruitment, retention, diver-
sity, legal counsel, training, and bene-
fits. These recommendations recognize 
that attracting and retaining a diverse 
and highly qualified workforce requires 
offering competitive benefits and a mo-
tivating work environment. 
The 
second 
set 
overhauls 
the 
onboarding process for new Members 
and provides continuing education for 
all Members. 
The select committee has heard a lot 
about how new Member orientation 
should be nonpartisan and should in-
clude courses emphasizing the neces-
sity of civility and respect. Rather 
than divide new Members by party as 
soon as they arrive here for orienta-
tion, we should encourage more rela-
tionship building. 
Whether at the start of someone’s 
service or later, Members should also 
have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
continue 
learning best practices so they can bet-
ter serve those they represent. 
The third set of recommendations 
modernizes House technology resources 
and emphasizes quality IT services to 
reduce reliance on outside vendors, to 
leverage bulk purchasing power, and to 
save taxpayer dollars. 
Congress has been described by one of 
our colleagues as an 18th century insti-
tution using 20th century technology 
to solve 21st century problems. To ad-
dress that, we also recommend reestab-
lishing and reenvisioning the Office of 
Technology Assessment to help Con-
gress address modern science and tech-
nology challenges. 
Our fourth set of recommendations 
establishes that all proceedings and 
functions of the House should be made 
accessible to all Americans. 
This year, we celebrate the 30th anni-
versary of the signing of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. While much 
progress has been made, there is still a 
lot of work to do to ensure that Ameri-
cans with disabilities do not face dis-
crimination. 
Our 
recommendations 
seek to address the equal access chal-
lenges persons with disabilities face 
when working for, visiting, or inter-
acting with Congress. 
Before I continue and dive into some 
of the other work of the select com-
mittee, I want to invite my colleague 
and the vice chair of the committee, 
the gentleman from Georgia, TOM 
GRAVES, to say a few words. 
TOM has been a terrific partner, and I 
value the way that he has approached 
this committee, approaching these as 
problems to be solved, not working to 
score political points and, like every 
member of this committee, has really 
had his oar in the water trying to move 
our effort forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. GRAVES), and 
I invite him to say a few words. 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, let me first thank Chairman 
KILMER for his great work. How he has 
led this committee has been remark-
able and an example for all commit-
tees, so I thank him for that example. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today not 
only to commend my good friend from 
Washington State, but to echo his re-
marks and also the pride and the joy 
that each of us on the committee share 
in the work that has been done. 
I guess tonight I am representing the 
six Republican members of this com-
pletely bipartisan committee, and we 
have all committed to work together in 
a great way. So, on behalf of our side, 
I thank the chairman for his good 
work. 
In the last year, as Mr. KILMER 
shared, we have passed 45 recommenda-
tions to make Congress work better for 
the American people. Now, he has high-
lighted the way we have worked to-
gether to get that job done, and I want 
to commend him for leading us in an 
environment of bipartisanship and true 
collaboration. It is through his com-
mitment to success and thinking out-
side of the box that we have been able 
to break the mold and to get this job 
done. This is an opportunity that 
comes around about every couple of 
decades, and to see the work that the 
chairman has done and how he has led 
this committee is really a great thing 
to be a part of. 
When the select committee first 
started, we chose to work together and 
combine our resources as one team. In-
stead of separating the staff and office 
by party line, we chose to just join to-
gether and work to get the job done as 
one team. 
As Mr. KILMER often says: We decided 
to put the committee not in red jerseys 
and in blue jerseys but, instead, ‘‘fix 
Congress’’ jerseys. Thanks to him, this 
experiment has created a bipartisan-
ship bond of trust and collaboration 
unlike anything I have seen in my 10 
years here in Congress. 
In fact, our committee was only sup-
posed to last for 1 year, through 2019.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1186 
February 25, 2020 
But thanks to the support of our col-
leagues throughout the House, from 
freshman 
Members 
to 
Republican 
Study Committee members, to House 
leadership in both parties, to the new 
Democrat members of that Caucus and 
many other caucuses, we were able to 
get our committee extended through 
the end of this Congress. 
Now, I know I speak for both of us 
when I say that we are grateful for the 
opportunity to build on last year’s 
work and dive a little bit deeper into 
the issues affecting the legislative 
branch. 
Every 
recommendation 
we 
make aims to strengthen the capacity 
of the House so that we can better 
serve all Americans. 
Our goal is simple. It was something 
we set out early on in an early retreat 
that we had together. The goal is sim-
ple, but it is critical, and that is we are 
to make Congress work better for the 
American people. It is that simple but 
yet that critical. 
So, as the chairman shared, our first 
round 
of 
transparency-focused 
rec-
ommendations in May aimed to ‘‘open 
up’’ Congress for the American people. 
The work we do here in Washington is 
for our constituents, and they should 
be able to easily access information 
about our votes, about the bills and 
who is lobbying Congress. 
What happens here should just be a 
click away, as the chairman said a 
minute ago, just one click, one-stop 
shopping. We want to make sure that 
the American people can truly view the 
inner workings of Congress. 
While exploring ways to improve 
transparency and access, we heard 
from many of our colleagues and staff 
about the need for better technology 
and better processes here in the House. 
This also included giving offices the 
flexibility to hire more staff and to 
meet the needs of their constituents, as 
it is individual in each and every of-
fice. 
We also recommended creating a 
Congressional Leadership Academy to 
offer training for Members, not just 
any ordinary training, but professional 
development training, because each 
and every Member deserves that oppor-
tunity to better prepare themselves in 
how to manage their offices and better 
represent their districts. 
Every day that we are here, we 
should be asking the questions and 
learning about the issues that matter 
most to our constituents. Continued 
learning is an important part and an 
important piece of our representation 
here in Congress. 
Another one of our recommendations 
that I think is incredibly important is 
that Members of Congress should re-
ceive mandatory cybersecurity train-
ing. Now, this idea came from one of 
our colleagues on our Member listening 
day, Miss KATHLEEN RICE from New 
York. She has a bill that requires this 
practice, and it is something that we 
have pushed forward as a recommenda-
tion in the House. Congressional staff 
must undergo cybersecurity training, 
so our thought is that Members of Con-
gress should do the same. 
In September, we held a hearing to 
discuss improving civility throughout 
the Halls of Congress. At times, it felt 
like we were going against the grain 
just a bit on this issue. Recommenda-
tions on civility and bipartisanship are 
not something that I think the Amer-
ican people have heard from much here 
in Congress, but I think that is why 
this committee’s work matters so 
much. 
Even during times of division, we 
have to find a path forward. We rec-
ommended creating a bipartisan, Mem-
bers-only space here in the Capitol to 
encourage more collaboration across 
party lines and instituting biennial bi-
partisan retreats for Members and 
their families at the start of each Con-
gress so that Members and their fami-
lies can begin to get to know each 
other. 
I have often said that the breakdown 
in civility and bipartisanship here in 
Washington is because of the break-
down in relationships; and, in fact, 
maybe it is because many relationships 
haven’t even begun yet. So it is impor-
tant that we can talk to each other 
but, most importantly, that we can lis-
ten to one another. 
So when it comes to communicating, 
we recognize the importance of good, 
robust communication with the Amer-
ican people as well. That is why we rec-
ommended increasing opportunities for 
constituents 
to 
communicate 
with 
their Representatives and allowing for 
faster correspondence between our of-
fices and our constituents. 
b 1745 
Now, we aren’t finished yet. We have 
more work to do before the year is 
over. And I can think of no better cap-
stone to my legislative career than to 
leave Congress in better shape for fu-
ture Representatives. 
Through the partnership of this com-
mittee with the Committee on House 
Administration, we have crafted legis-
lation that will turn our bipartisan 
recommendations into results. This on-
going work is so important because it 
is the first time a committee like ours 
has seen its work move through the 
legislative process in this way. 
So, as I close, no idea is too big or 
too small, and we encourage everyone 
to continue sharing their ideas with us 
to reform Congress. Together, we are 
giving the House a roadmap for a 
brighter future, and it wouldn’t be pos-
sible without the great leadership of 
Chairman KILMER. 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his kind 
words and for his partnership. This has 
been a true partnership with every 
member of the committee, but I par-
ticularly appreciate Mr. GRAVES’ lead-
ership as our vice chair. 
Madam Speaker, I want to just dive 
in a bit on where he ended, which is we 
are the first select committee in sev-
eral decades to propose and adopt rec-
ommendations on a rolling basis. Put 
simply, when we have consensus, we 
move. 
We are also the first select com-
mittee in recent history to introduce 
our recommendations as legislation, to 
ensure that they actually get imple-
mented further on down the road. 
We introduced legislation in Decem-
ber, H. Res. 756, that incorporates the 
first two sets of recommendations 
passed by the select committee, and we 
are expecting a committee markup 
soon. 
The select committee unanimously 
approved a third set of recommenda-
tions in December, and those rec-
ommendations fit into three broad cat-
egories. 
The first set emphasizes the neces-
sity of civility and the importance of 
bipartisan collaboration in Congress. 
Select 
committee 
members 
believe 
that Congress is stronger when Mem-
bers find ways to work together to 
solve problems, and civility is key to 
making Congress a more productive in-
stitution that better serves the Amer-
ican people. That is especially impor-
tant now. And the select committee in-
tends to continue pushing for improved 
civility through further recommenda-
tions. 
The second set addresses various ad-
ministrative inefficiencies in Congress: 
to update Member cosponsorship pow-
ers, procurement and bulk purchasing 
policies, the travel card program, and 
Member emergency preparedness train-
ing. 
And the third set, modernize the 
House Franking Commission on mail-
ing standards and its regulations gov-
erning all Member communications. 
The select committee worked closely 
with the Franking Commission to de-
velop these recommendations, and we 
were pleased to see the Commission 
implement 
updated 
communication 
standards for Members in January. The 
new 
guidelines 
modernize 
franking 
rules by including digital communica-
tions, improving transparency, expe-
diting the review process, and allowing 
for more seamless interaction with 
constituents across platforms. 
As with our first two sets of rec-
ommendations, the select committee 
will introduce legislation that incor-
porates our third set of recommenda-
tions to ensure further implementa-
tion. We don’t want to just make rec-
ommendations for the sake of making 
recommendations; we want to make 
recommendations that actually im-
prove Congress and its function on be-
half of the American people. 
The select committee has accom-
plished a great deal in the past year, 
but there is still a lot more work to do. 
I believe I speak for all of the members 
of the committee when I say we are 
ready for that challenge. Our plan is to 
build on our success thus far and con-
tinue issuing recommendations over 
the next several months. 
Working to build a more efficient and 
effective Congress that will better

PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 116th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION

.
S1123 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2020 
No. 37 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O Lord our God, how excellent is 
Your Name in all the Earth. From 
dawn to sunset, Your mercies sustain 
us. 
Today, inspire our Senators to em-
brace Your promises. May they remem-
ber Your promises to supply their 
needs, to never forsake them, and to 
prevent anything from separating them 
from Your love. 
Lord, bestow Your blessings upon our 
lawmakers, 
making 
them 
wiser, 
stronger, and better, glorifying You in 
their labors. Use them to advance Your 
Kingdom in our Nation and world, as 
they attune their will to Your pur-
poses. 
We pray in Your blessed Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
would like to bring my colleagues up to 
date on a bipartisan bill to lower drug 
prices and also, at the same time, give 
an update on the pharmaceutical in-
dustry’s opposition to this legislation. 
Beware the next time Big Pharma 
claims what we are trying to do to 
lower drug prices, in their words, ‘‘un-
dermines the free market.’’ Just re-
member this. The pharmaceutical in-
dustry supported ObamaCare. 
Big Pharma doesn’t want a free mar-
ket. Take note that this industry op-
poses every proposal that would cost it 
money and supports every proposal 
that ensures another government rev-
enue stream. That is exactly what 
ObamaCare did and that is what Medi-
care and Medicaid do now. 
Big Pharma has become so big and 
entitled that they have the gall to 
claim that limiting taxpayer subsidies 
is somehow socialism. ObamaCare has 
a stream that does that, as does Medi-
care and Medicaid. In fact, this is what 
ending corporate welfare and demand-
ing accountability to taxpayers is all 
about. It seems to me that ending 
those subsidies would be a very con-
servative principle. 
The 
Grassley-Wyden 
prescription 
drug bill saves tens of billions of dol-
lars of taxpayer money and has no neg-
ative impact on pharmaceutical inno-
vation. That is exactly what the CBO 
has said and that is why even the free- 
market, libertarian CATO Institute has 
endorsed this legislation. 
So I encourage my Republican col-
leagues to join me and Senator WYDEN 
in that bipartisan effort. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
ABORTION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
today, every Senator will be able to 
take a clear moral stand. We will have 
the chance to proceed to commonsense 
legislation that will move our Nation 
closer to the international mainstream 
with respect to defending innocent 
human life. There are only seven na-
tions left in the entire world where an 
unborn child can be killed by elective 
abortion after 20 weeks, and the United 
States of America, unfortunately, is 
one of them. 
Set aside all of the far-left rhetoric 
that 
will 
greet 
Senator 
GRAHAM’s 
straightforward legislation and con-
sider this simple fact: Do our Demo-
cratic colleagues really believe that 
what our country needs is a radical 
fringe position on elective abortion 
that we only share with China, North 
Korea, and four other countries in the 
entire world? 
The American people don’t seem to 
think that is what we need. One recent 
survey found that 70 percent of all 
Americans believe that at a min-
imum—at a minimum—elective abor-
tion should be limited to the first 3 
months of pregnancy. That even in-
cludes about half of the respondents 
who self-identify as pro-choice. 
I hope this body will proceed to Sen-
ator GRAHAM’s Pain-Capable Unborn 
Child Protection Act later today. I see 
no reason why at the very least our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
should 
vote 
against even proceeding to this legisla-
tion and having a debate. If there is a 
persuasive and principled case why 
America should remain on the radical 
international fringe on this subject, let 
us hear it. Let us have the debate. Few 
Americans agree with that radical po-
sition, but let’s have the debate. 
If my Democratic colleagues block 
the Senate from even proceeding to 
consider this legislation here today, 
the message they will send will be 
chilling and clear. The radical demands 
of the far left will drown out common 
sense and the views of most Americans. 
The same goes for Senator SASSE’s 
legislation, the Born-Alive Survivors 
Protection Act. Even if most Wash-
ington Democrats persist in their re-
sistance to any commonsense protec-
tions for the unborn, surely, we must

be able to agree that children who are 
born deserve protection. Surely, that 
much cannot be controversial. 
There is currently no Federal man-
date that children who are delivered 
alive following an attempted abortion 
should receive medical care. There is 
no clear guarantee that every child 
born alive in the United States, wheth-
er they were intended to be or not, is 
entitled to the same life-giving medical 
attention. 
The Kentuckians whom I speak with 
cannot comprehend why this could be 
some hotly debated proposition. It al-
most defies belief that an entire polit-
ical party can find cause to object to 
this basic protection for babies. Yet, 
today, we will see if our Democratic 
colleagues will even permit the Senate 
to proceed to this legislation. We will 
see whether even something this sim-
ple and this morally straightforward is 
a bridge too far for the far left. 
I would urge all of my colleagues: 
Let’s advance these bills. Let’s take 
these modest steps. Let’s have the 
courage to say that the right to life 
must not exclude the most vulnerable 
among us. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JAY KHOSLA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on a totally different matter, I have a 
duty this morning that somehow ranks 
among my most favorite activities and 
least 
favorite 
activities 
simulta-
neously. The good news is that I get to 
recognize a key member of my staff 
whom I have come to know and admire 
a great deal. The bad news is the occa-
sion. This week, after 15 years of out-
standing service, he is bidding farewell 
to the Senate. So I am unhappy with 
the circumstances, but I could not be 
more happy to talk about Jay Khosla. 
For just shy of 2 years, Jay has 
served as my chief economic policy 
counsel. Trade, taxes, banking, and fi-
nancial services; pensions and retire-
ment; housing—for 2 years, any answer 
I needed on any of these subjects was 
one phone call, one email, or one quick 
meeting away. You can go a long way 
in this town if you master either the 
policy details of big issues or the poli-
tics surrounding those issues. Jay has 
mastered both. 
When you have a lot of talent and in-
telligence, major projects tend to find 
their way to your desk. So consider the 
fact that Jay has been at the center of 
practically every major economic pol-
icy achievement over the past decade- 
plus. 
Jay arrived as a young healthcare 
staffer for then-Majority Leader Bill 
Frist. Talk about an opening act—not 
just working for a majority leader, but 
one who is also an M.D. and who is fo-
cused on healthcare. The bar was set 
high, but Jay, of course, exceeded it. 
He moved to the Budget Committee 
and then crafted policy for Senator 
McCain’s Presidential campaign. Then, 
he returned to work for Senator Hatch 
and the Finance Committee. Before 
long, Jay was Senator Hatch’s secret 
weapon. As he rose through the ranks 
to policy director and then to staff di-
rector, he rapidly became a not-so-se-
cret weapon. He was an invaluable 
asset to the chairman, to the com-
mittee, and, really, to our entire con-
ference. 
His relationships extended across the 
aisle as well. Our Democratic col-
leagues respect him greatly. His col-
leagues on the committee remember 
that, even when it might have been 
easier to pull back behind party lines 
and just try to craft a bill within the 
majority, Jay stayed stubbornly dedi-
cated to the bipartisan process as long 
as possible. 
A team player, an honest broker, Jay 
doesn’t want to just get big things 
done, he wants to get them done the 
right way. From trade promotion au-
thority in 2015 and historic tax reform 
in 2017, to USMCA this past year, these 
huge accomplishments and many more, 
like fighting the opioid epidemic and 
fixing the dysfunctional sustainable 
growth rate that has plagued Medi-
care—all of these issues had this staff 
leader right at the center. In many 
cases, his work started months or years 
in advance, meeting with leaders, pour-
ing the foundation for new policy, and 
staying on the case right through to 
the finish line. 
Needless to say, this is a resume 
that, basically, anyone in Washington 
would kill for, but effectiveness is only 
part of Jay’s magic. The colleagues 
whom Jay supervised at the Finance 
Committee remember a boss who was 
kind, 
generous, 
patient, 
and 
unflappable, even as he guided them 
through legislation of the highest con-
sequence. 
More recently, we in the majority 
leader’s office have relished his laugh- 
out-loud punch lines, his deadpan sar-
casm, and his creative nicknames. Jay 
is willing to take everyone down a peg 
when they need it, including himself. 
I have worked with all kinds of tal-
ented staff, but I have to say that the 
demeanor that Jay brings to work is 
somewhat unique. Despite being so 
knowledgeable, connected, and hard- 
working, Jay seems to flow through all 
the challenges with a confidence and 
calmness that almost borders on relax-
ation. If you didn’t know better, you 
would almost be suspicious. Somehow, 
you never see Jay sweat—well, at least 
not in the office, anyway. 
Jay’s colleagues like to rib him 
about the personal training regimen he 
maintains, 
along 
with 
the 
ultra- 
healthy diet and other enviable aspects 
of work-life balance that he somehow 
manages to carve out in this place that 
is so notorious for none of that. It is all 
part of the unique Jay Khosla magic. 
This is someone who has been known 
to reply to serious email inquiries with 
a funny photo of a cat dangling from a 
tree 
branch, 
captioned 
‘‘Hang 
In 
There!’’ 
Jay is someone who frequently con-
cludes his answers to pressing ques-
tions, including from Senators, with a 
smile and this catchphrase: ‘‘I have a 
feeling it’s all going to work out.’’ 
Somebody less accomplished would 
never get away with this. From some-
one with less mastery of the details, 
you would scoff and find someone else 
to talk with, but when it is Jay, you 
know everything will actually work 
out because he is the one on the case. 
Jay helps make everyone around him 
as calm, confident, and cheerful as he 
is. It is not just because of his cha-
risma. It is because he is so good at 
what he does. So, look, it is never fun 
to bid farewell to someone who is a big 
part of the brains of your operation, 
and it is never fun to say goodbye to 
someone who is a big part of the heart 
of your team either, and it is really no 
fun to say goodbye to somebody who 
has managed to be both. 
Jay has only formally worked for me 
for a couple of years, but he has been a 
trusted advisor and an honorary part of 
my team for a lot longer. He has been 
a big part of the Senate for more than 
a decade. 
When I say that Jay knows how to 
prioritize, I mean it, and his real bot-
tom line is family. He and his beloved 
wife Lisa have two boys, Shya and 
Asher. They form a tight-knit unit to-
gether with Jay’s parents, Vijay and 
Suman, and his sister Anchal and be-
yond. Jay may have made it look sus-
piciously easy all these years, but jobs 
like this are never easy, least of all on 
your family. It turns out that the 
Khosla clan would like to see a little 
more of this guy, and Jay doesn’t mind 
the sound of a new chapter and some 
new challenges either. 
We are really going to miss him. We 
thank him for everything. We feel cer-
tain his next chapters will bring new 
happiness all their own. As a wise man 
once told me, ‘‘I have a feeling it’s all 
going to work out.’’

Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the coronavirus has already spread to 
30 countries, including South Korea, 
Italy, Iran, and 53 confirmed cases here 
in the United States. Officials at the 
World Health Organization are now 
warning world governments to begin 
preparing for a pandemic—a pandemic. 
Here in the United States, the Trump 
administration has been caught flat-
footed. The administration has no plan 
to deal with the coronavirus—no plan— 
and seemingly no urgency to develop 
one. Even now, after the virus has al-
ready become a worldwide health cri-
sis, with rapidly growing economic 
risks, the Trump administration is 
scrambling to respond. We have a cri-
sis, and the Trump administration is 
trying to build an airplane while al-
ready in midflight. The harsh fact of 
the matter is, the Trump administra-
tion has shown towering and dangerous 
incompetence when it comes to the 
coronavirus. 
Coronavirus testing kits have not 
been widely distributed to our hos-
pitals and public health labs. Those 
without these kits must send samples 
all the way to Atlanta rather than 
testing them on site, wasting precious 
time as the virus spreads. 
The administration has eliminated— 
eliminated—the global health security 
teams. That is global health security, 
just what we need now. They have 
eliminated the teams from both the 
National Security Council and the De-
partment of Homeland Security. And 
thanks to years of cuts to the global 
health division at the Centers for Dis-
ease Control by the Trump administra-
tion, the CDC has been forced to reduce 
the number of countries it operates in 
from 49 to 10. 
These are our frontlines. If we can 
deal with these diseases before they get 
to the United States, we are a lot safer, 
and the administration has mercilessly 
and thoughtlessly cut, cut, cut these 
teams. And then, only a month ago, 
even as we began to hear about the 
coronavirus in China, the administra-
tion sent us a budget that proposed 
cutting the CDC budget by 16 percent. 
The 
CDC 
is 
the 
agency 
on 
the 
frontlines that keeps us safe, keeps us 
healthy, and prevents American lives 
from being lost. 
Four words describe the administra-
tion’s response to the coronavirus: tow-
ering and dangerous incompetence. 
When 
officials 
at 
the 
CDC 
rec-
ommended that infected passengers 
from a cruise ship not be flown to the 
United 
States 
alongside 
the 
non-
infected passengers, the State Depart-
ment overruled them. Shockingly, they 
put infected and noninfected on the 
same plane. Was this because of poli-
tics? Did somebody call President 
Trump or someone else? There are ru-
mors to that effect. We don’t know if 
they are true. They should be checked 
out. 
Typical 
of 
the 
administration, 
though, or certainly typical in so many 
different 
instances, 
decisions 
were 
made based on politics and optics rath-
er than on the informed opinion of our 
scientists and doctors. It is like the So-
viet apparatchiks overruling the nu-
clear scientists at Chernobyl to avoid 
embarrassment to the regime. 
Federal 
agencies 
have 
been 
so 
hollowed out that one of the key fig-
ures in responding to the coronavirus 
in our government is Ken Cuccinelli, 
an immigration hard-liner ideologue 
with no public health expertise. Yester-
day, Mr. Cuccinelli posted a tweet ac-
tually asking for information about 
the spread of the coronavirus. The one 
person the administration can come up 
with to help deal with the issue then 
emails and asks for information. This 
is, of course, because he has no knowl-
edge. He is not a scientist. He is not a 
disease preventer. This is towering and 
dangerous incompetence. 
President Trump, meanwhile, has 
said that the coronavirus might ‘‘mi-
raculously’’ fade once the weather gets 
warmer—towering and dangerous in-
competence. With no plan to deal with 
this potential health crisis, the admin-
istration last night issued an emer-
gency budget request. It was too little 
and too late. It asked Congress to re-
program funding dedicated to fighting 
Ebola—still considered an epidemic in 
the 
Democratic 
Republic 
of 
the 
Congo—to deal with coronavirus. That 
is robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is fur-
ther evidence that the administration 
is not taking the coronavirus as seri-
ously as it should. I said as much last 
night here on the floor. 
The President seemed upset about 
my criticism of the budget proposal 
this morning. I am glad he has noticed. 
Maybe he will start taking this issue 
more seriously. Now that I have gotten 
the President’s attention, I want to lay 
out five things the Trump administra-
tion must do to get a handle on the 
coronavirus. 
The administration must, at a min-
imum, restore the cuts to the CDC 
budget. Trump’s cuts to the CDC budg-
et have had dramatic effects, shrinking 
the agency’s footprint abroad to help 
combat pandemics. The administration 
must commit now to reverse it. 
The Trump administration must ap-
point a point person—a czar—to imple-
ment a real plan to manage the 
coronavirus: 
an 
independent, 
non-
partisan, global health expert with real 
expertise, not a political appointee like 
Cuccinelli—somebody who is a sci-
entist who knows these issues and can 
coordinate the myriad Federal agen-
cies to fight the fight and prevent 
American lives from being lost. 
The administration must increase its 
emergency budget request to at least 
$3.1 billion with no cuts—no cuts—for 
Ebola funding, which is still raging in 
Africa. The $3.1 billion is the amount 
our public health organizations say is 
necessary. The funding must also in-
clude a commitment to reimburse 
States and localities for all expenses 
related to addressing the outbreak. 
The Trump administration must ex-
pedite delivery of diagnostic testing 
kits to all 50 States and public health 
laboratories so the tests don’t have to 
be sent—these samples don’t have to be 
sent to Atlanta and people wait, wait, 
and wait for a result as the disease 
spreads. 
And finally, the administration must 
stop the proliferation of junk insurance 
plans 
that 
do 
not 
even 
cover 
coronavirus tests and other related 
healthcare services. This is typical of 
why we have opposed these junk plans. 
They cover hardly anything. Now that 
we have this crisis—the coronavirus— 
so many people who have these junk 
plans will not get tested because they 
can’t afford it and because their plans 
don’t cover it, a glaring example of 
why junk health plans—the adminis-
tration’s solution, it seems, to the 
health crisis—are totally inadequate 
and dangerous. 
These are five basic steps that any 
competent administration would have 
already taken in preparation for the 
pandemic. There may be others as well, 
but this is what happens when you 
have an administration and a President 
so skeptical of science, so contemp-
tuous of expertise, so practiced in ob-
scuring inconvenient facts, and so dis-
dainful of organization and prepara-
tion. 
Madam President, you need to get 
your act together now. This is a crisis. 
We need you to act. We need this ad-
ministration to finally do the right 
thing after weeks of dithering and ex-
hibiting towering and dangerous in-
competence. 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
Madam President, on another matter 
also related to healthcare, today Lead-
er MCCONNELL and Senate Republicans 
have scheduled votes on two divisive, 
anti-choice, anti-women, and anti-fam-
ily bills. The Senate has voted them 
down before; it will again. 
After weeks of complaining that the 
impeachment trial of President Trump 
was preventing the Senate from doing 
the people’s business, this is what the 
Senate 
Republicans 
have 
proposed: 
fake, dishonest, and extreme legisla-
tion that has nothing to do with im-
proving the lives of ordinary Ameri-
cans. I say ‘‘fake’’ because these bills 
pretend we don’t already have laws on 
the books that protect infants. Addi-
tional legislation is completely unnec-
essary, irrational, a show with no posi-
tive effect on the women of America 
who need healthcare. Healthcare, Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1126 
February 25, 2020 
President. Healthcare, Republican Sen-
ators. Healthcare. That is what women 
want, not these show bills that appeal 
to an extreme view. The American peo-
ple know it. The American women 
know it. 
Additional legislation such as pro-
posed today is at best unnecessary and 
irrational. But it is dishonest because 
these bills are not intended to fix real 
problems faced by real Americans; they 
are intended to provoke fear and mis-
understanding about a very difficult 
issue so Republicans can score political 
points with their far-right base. Any 
Senator who thinks this is going to ap-
peal to the mainstream of their con-
stituents—women 
throughout 
their 
States—is missing the point. 
I say ‘‘extreme’’ because these bills 
would, in effect, criminalize women’s 
reproductive 
care 
and 
intimidate 
healthcare providers—another example 
of the Senate Republicans’ war on Roe 
v. Wade and a woman’s constitu-
tionally protected right to make her 
own private healthcare decisions and 
to not have politicians tell a woman 
what to do. 
Putting these already defeated bills 
up for a show vote is not a good-faith 
attempt to improve the lives of every-
day Americans—particularly everyday 
American 
women—as 
Republicans 
claim they want to desperately do. 
Every single Senate Republican knows 
these bills cannot and will not pass, 
but they are putting them on the floor 
anyway to pander to the hard right and 
to cover up the fact that they will not 
provide good healthcare for women, 
that they are voting day in and day out 
to take away the right to healthcare of 
women throughout America and let-
ting the administration, led by Presi-
dent Trump, do just that. 
If Republicans were serious about 
getting back to the people’s business, 
there is no shortage of bipartisan legis-
lation we could consider. Nearly 400 
bills have passed the House, hundreds 
of them on a bipartisan basis, and they 
have collected dust in this Chamber. 
They have gone into Leader MCCON-
NELL’s 
legislative 
trash 
can. 
On 
healthcare alone, we have legislation 
to protect Americans with preexisting 
conditions, 
legislation 
that 
would 
eliminate junk insurance plans, and 
legislation to reduce maternal and in-
fant mortality rates, which my col-
league from Illinois will talk about, I 
believe, shortly. All of these bills have 
languished in Leader MCCONNELL’s leg-
islative junkyard. 
When Leader MCCONNELL or any Re-
publican 
says 
‘‘Oh, 
impeachment 
stopped us from doing things,’’ look at 
what we are not doing today—not only 
what we are doing, which is meaning-
less to women, but what we are not 
doing—protecting 
their 
healthcare, 
protecting Roe v. Wade, which two- 
thirds of American women want pro-
tected. 
Any of the proposals that are in Mc-
Connell’s legislative graveyard would 
be better than this anti-choice, anti- 
women, and anti-family legislation, 
but, typical of Leader MCCONNELL, Re-
publicans have chosen once again to 
play politics on the Senate floor. 
Leader MCCONNELL should stop wast-
ing the few votes he does schedule with 
these shameless political stunts and in-
stead bring legislation to the floor that 
would actually improve the healthcare 
of the American people and of Amer-
ican women in particular. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Democratic whip is 
recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
would like to note that this morning at 
8 a.m., an unusual meeting took place 
in this Capitol Building. It was in the 
area of the building that is reserved for 
top-secret 
classified 
briefings. 
All 
Members of the Senate were invited. 
The issue at that briefing was the 
coronavirus. 
I sat through the major part of that 
briefing before I had to leave for an-
other meeting. There wasn’t anything 
in there that should have been classi-
fied or top secret. If there were ever a 
time when we need to be open, honest, 
and complete in telling the whole story 
to the American people, it is this mo-
ment when we face the coronavirus, 
which started, we believe, in China and 
is now spreading across the world. 
I back up what the Democratic leader 
said earlier because the request was 
made at this meeting for some $2 bil-
lion in the United States to respond to 
this coronavirus threat. When we ques-
tioned the administration as to why 
that number and what they were going 
to do with it, the answers were limited. 
In fact, when it came to the source of 
the money, they had no answer at all. 
Remember, this is an administration 
which has consistently asked to cut 
the funding for the Centers for Disease 
Control. It has been a low priority of 
the Trump administration until we 
faced this threat, and now they have 
suddenly awakened. It turns out that 
even in the next fiscal year, which be-
gins on October 1, the Trump adminis-
tration has asked to cut the money for 
the Centers for Disease Control again. 
You ask yourself, who is in charge 
over there? Who is making the basic 
decisions? Well, it could be the person 
who has decided that every available 
dollar needs to be put into a wall on 
the Mexican border. 
Think of this for a moment: Ten bil-
lion dollars currently sits in an ac-
count for the building of this wall— 
unspent. They can’t spend it. Yet the 
President recently asked for $3.8 billion 
more for building his almighty wall— 
which I thought Mexico was going to 
pay for—and now comes at the last 
minute asking for some $2 billion for 
the coronavirus. 
As one Senator said in the meeting 
this morning, when it comes down to 
it, if our business is to protect the 
American people, isn’t the highest pri-
ority to stop the spread of this virus in 
the United States? Of course it is, and 
that is why it should be a higher pri-
ority. No wall is going to stop that 
virus from coming into the United 
States. The President ought to wake 
up to that reality. 
When you look at the efforts that are 
being made here in the United States 
and around the world, we can and 
should do more. I support this request 
for a dramatic increase in funding for 
this 
purpose 
now—now, 
before 
it 
spreads 
across 
the 
United 
States, 
which God forbid it ever does. We don’t 
want it to. We want to make sure we 
have done everything in our power to 
stop it, and that means empowering 
those in charge with the knowledge, 
with the expertise, and with the au-
thority to protect our families. First 
and foremost, protect American fami-
lies. That is a much higher priority 
than any campaign promise this Presi-
dent made about a wall on our south-
ern border. 
I support the effort by Senator SCHU-
MER asking for some top doc or some 
individual with management author-
ity, management experience, and the 
knowledge of the public health threat 
we face with this coronavirus, to be put 
in charge to coordinate the myriad 
agencies that will be touched by this 
campaign to protect America. Now is 
the time to do it. The time to do it—at 
least now, but it should have been 
much earlier, with more money dedi-
cated to this purpose rather than cut-
ting back on these key agencies. 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
Madam President, on a related topic, 
related to health, this morning Senator 
MITCH MCCONNELL came to the floor 
and said that today, this afternoon, we 
are likely to take up two votes on mo-
tions to proceed. This is so typical now 
of what we do in the Senate. Instead of 
bringing a measure to the floor with an 
understanding of an amendment proc-
ess so that we can discuss it fully, vote 
on it in many different aspects, and 
then come to a conclusion with a ma-
jority vote in this body, Senator 
MCCONNELL comes to the floor with an-
other drive-by political hit on the issue 
of women’s reproductive health. 
We know what this issue is all about. 
Many of us who have served for years 
know there is a fundamental difference 
among those of us here in the Senate, 
and we know what the outcome of this 
vote will be because at least one of 
these votes was cast last year on ex-
actly the same topic. So why would 
Senator MCCONNELL bring it back? It is 
to get that drive-by shooting when it 
comes to this political issue. To me, 
that is unfortunate, and I would like to 
suggest there is a better alternative. 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Madam President, this is Black His-
tory Month, and I want to take the 
time to celebrate a person who made 
history when it came to healthcare. 
Helen Octavia Dickens was born in 
Dayton, OH, in 1909, a daughter of a 
former slave. She attended Crane Jun-
ior College in Chicago, now Malcolm X

College. In 1934, she graduated from the 
University of Illinois College of Medi-
cine, Chicago, as the only African- 
American woman in her class of 137 
students. She was the university’s first 
Black woman physician graduate. 
Dr. Dickens became a specialist in 
obstetrics, eventually moving to Phila-
delphia to work in a birthing center, 
where she provided care for the poor. 
While there, she broke barriers by be-
coming 
the 
first 
African-American 
woman to be admitted into the Amer-
ican College of Surgeons, receive board 
certification in obstetrics and gyne-
cology, and practice medicine in Phila-
delphia. 
Her work to help heal and guide 
women of all ages was nothing short of 
inspiring and her efforts to shine light 
on the troubling issue of health dis-
parities in the United States that con-
tinues to this day. Let me be specific. 
America has a long history of med-
ical inequality. Sadly, we know that 
history has not ended. From premature 
births to premature deaths, people of 
color disproportionately bear the brunt 
of America’s troubled healthcare sys-
tem. On average, they live sicker, die 
sooner, and go without needed medical 
care more often. Communities of color 
suffer disproportionately from HIV, 
heart disease, stroke, diabetes, kidney 
failure, prostate cancer, and other 
medical conditions. 
President Obama signed the Afford-
able Care Act into law nearly 10 years 
ago. It is still one of my proudest 
votes. Thanks to that law, 20 million 
Americans gained health insurance— 
more than 1 million in my home State 
of Illinois. 
I am proud to say that law has taken 
strong steps to address racial inequal-
ities in healthcare across America. A 
report last month found that the Af-
fordable Care Act helped narrow racial 
and ethnic disparities in healthcare ac-
cess and coverage, especially in States 
like mine—Illinois—that expanded the 
reach of Medicaid. Yet we know that 
better is not nearly good enough when 
it comes to healthcare. Nearly half of 
Black Americans—46 percent—live in 
the 15 States that did not expand Med-
icaid coverage after the Affordable 
Care Act was passed. 
Another area of racial disparity is 
maternal and infant health. I raise this 
issue because instead of these drive-by 
issue votes, which Senator MCCONNELL 
insists on without debate and without 
amendment, we should be addressing 
an issue that should have bipartisan 
support. Let me be specific about what 
I mean. 
The United States ranks 32nd out of 
the 35 wealthiest nations when it 
comes to infant death, infant mor-
tality. Let me repeat that. Our Nation 
ranks 32nd out of the 35 wealthiest na-
tions when it comes to infant mor-
tality, and babies of color are the hard-
est hit. 
If you are an African-American in-
fant born in America today, you are 
twice as likely to die in the first year 
of birth compared to White infants. 
And the mother giving birth? In the 
United 
States, 
African-American 
women are three to four times more 
likely to die giving birth than other 
women in this country. In Illinois, 
sadly, they are six times more likely to 
die. 
The United States is one of only 13 
countries in the world where the ma-
ternal mortality rate is worse now 
than it was 25 years ago. Instead of im-
paling ourselves politically on the 
issues that divide us, can we come to-
gether on an issue that could unite us: 
that we are going to do something in 
America to reduce the infant and ma-
ternal mortality, particularly among 
African Americans. 
I have given a lot of thought to what 
we can do to try to bridge this racial 
divide to help women and babies of 
color. For the past two Congresses, I 
have introduced a bill with Illinois 
Congresswoman ROBIN
KELLY
called 
the MOMMA Act. The bill would ex-
pand Medicaid coverage for new moms 
from 60 days after birth to a full year 
postpartum to ensure adequate care 
after the child is delivered. The bill 
would also ensure implicit bias and cul-
tural 
competency 
training 
for 
healthcare providers to help address 
health disparities in communities of 
color and increase access to doulas. 
We are simply not doing enough to 
correct this injustice and save the lives 
of new moms and babies across the 
country. Instead, Senate Republicans 
are pushing two anti-choice bills this 
day that will do nothing—nothing—to 
help improve maternal and infant out-
comes in America nor to help address 
racial disparities that currently exist. 
If they actually wanted to save and im-
prove the lives of new moms and ba-
bies, they should consider passing leg-
islation like the MOMMA Act, which I 
have just described. I am going to try 
to call this to the floor this afternoon. 
Wouldn’t it be a breath of fresh air in 
the U.S. Senate if, on a bipartisan 
basis, we could agree to do something 
about this public health crisis affecting 
infants and mothers across America? 
The fact that we rank so low in the 
world standings of safety when it 
comes to delivering a baby among Afri-
can-American parents in this country 
is just unacceptable and unforgivable. 
Can we muster the courage to stop the 
political shootings here on the floor, 
this drive-by shooting of political 
issues, and instead address an issue 
which truly is a life-and-death matter 
that we all should agree on? The Re-
publicans have a choice this afternoon 
to join me in this effort. 
I am proud to stand here today and 
to honor Helen Dickens, the African- 
American doctor I described earlier 
who passed away in 2001. Her fierce ad-
vancement in the medical field helped 
pave the way for future doctors, par-
ticularly women of color, and led to 
important 
discoveries 
in 
women’s 
health. 
Today, much of what we know about 
the importance and effectiveness of an-
nual OB/GYN visits was influenced by 
Dr. Dickens’ work. With a grant from 
the National Institutes of Health, she 
helped train general practitioners to 
give women the exams they need to 
note early detection of cervical and 
uterine cancer. In 1982, the University 
of Illinois honored Dr. Dickens with 
the Distinguished Alumni Award. 
While the United States has a trou-
bled past in addressing racial inequal-
ity, we need to learn from the mistakes 
of the past to ensure that all Ameri-
cans receive the healthcare they de-
serve in the future. 
Dr. Helen Dickens and many other 
African-American pioneers give me 
hope for a brighter future. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ABORTION 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today 
we will vote on two pro-life bills: the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act and the Pain-Capable Unborn 
Child Protection Act. 
These bills should be completely 
uncontroversial. Every one of us in this 
Chamber ought to be able to agree that 
infants who are born alive during an 
abortion procedure should receive the 
same care that a baby born alive in a 
hospital would receive. 
Every one of us ought to agree that, 
at the very least, we should not be 
aborting babies after the point that 
they can feel pain, but unfortunately 
the abortion extremism in the Demo-
cratic Party is such that it is unlikely 
that these two bills will even get a 
chance to be debated. 
We shouldn’t even need the Born- 
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection 
Act. It should be obvious that any baby 
born alive, wherever he or she is born, 
ought to receive care, but with more 
than one leading Democrat over the 
past year refusing to rule out infan-
ticide, it has become clear that we need 
to underscore that being born alive in 
an abortion clinic instead of a hospital 
doesn’t eliminate a baby’s right to 
medical care. 
Like the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act, the Pain-Capa-
ble Unborn Child Protection Act should 
be a no-brainer. This legislation would 
ban abortions beginning in the sixth 
month of pregnancy, a point at which 
science has clearly demonstrated that 
the unborn child is able to feel pain— 
and not only able to feel pain. By this 
point in a pregnancy, approximately 20 
weeks, babies are almost able to sur-
vive outside of their mothers. Babies 
have survived after being born at 25 
weeks, at 24 weeks, at 23 weeks, and, 
like Ellie Schneider, who attended the 
State of the Union Address with her 
mom, at 21 weeks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1128 
February 25, 2020 
It is unthinkable that we are killing 
babies who are so far advanced that it 
is possible for them to survive outside 
of their mothers, but we are. In 2016, 
somewhere around 11,000 babies were 
aborted at or after the 21-week mark in 
pregnancy—11,000 in one year. 
Democrats like to point to European 
countries to support their push for gov-
ernment-run healthcare and other so-
cialist policies, but they never men-
tion—they never mention—that almost 
every European country has more lim-
its on abortion than we have here in 
the United States. In fact, the United 
States is one of just seven countries in 
the entire world that allow elective 
abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. 
Among the other countries are China 
and North Korea—not exactly the kind 
of company we want to be in when it 
comes 
to 
keeping 
and 
protecting 
human rights because—make no mis-
take—that is what we are talking 
about with abortion: human rights. 
Abortion denies unique, individual 
human beings, with their own finger-
prints and their own DNA, the most 
basic of human rights: the right to life. 
It is happening on a massive scale. 
Every year, in the United States alone, 
hundreds of thousands of irreplaceable 
human beings are killed by abortion. 
That is not some number that the pro- 
life movement has cooked up. That is 
straight. That is straight from the pro- 
abortion Guttmacher Institute, for-
merly affiliated with Planned Parent-
hood, which reports, ‘‘Approximately 
862,320 abortions were performed in 
2017’’—862,320. Most of us can’t even 
fathom a number that big. 
To put it in perspective, 862,000 is 
roughly equivalent to the population of 
the entire State of South Dakota, my 
home State. That is right. Think about 
that. In 2017 alone, the number of ba-
bies killed by abortion was roughly 
equivalent to the population of the en-
tire State of South Dakota. 
We can do better. Americans are bet-
ter than this. Our country was founded 
to safeguard human rights, not to take 
them away. While we haven’t always 
lived up to that promise, we have never 
stopped trying. It is time for us, as a 
country, to stand up and to start pro-
tecting the rights of unborn human 
beings. The Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act and the Pain-Ca-
pable Unborn Child Protection Act will 
not stop all, or even most, abortions, 
but they are an important step, a 
chance for us, as Americans, to draw a 
line in the sand and to start standing 
up for the rights of babies who are able 
or nearly able to survive outside of 
their mothers. It is time for us to join 
the vast majority of the global commu-
nity in prohibiting elective abortions 
past 20 weeks. It is time for us to make 
it clear that, no matter what some ex-
treme Democrats may say, Americans 
believe that all children, whether born 
alive in a hospital or in an abortion 
clinic, deserve protection and basic 
medical care. 
I hope my colleagues across the aisle 
will take a stand for human rights and 
for human decency and allow debate to 
move forward on these two important 
pro-life bills. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NOMINATION OF KATHARINE MACGREGOR 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
very briefly, here this afternoon, begin-
ning at 3:30, we will have a series of 
votes that include the nomination of 
Katharine MacGregor to be the Deputy 
Secretary of the Department of the In-
terior. I would like to provide my sup-
port for this nomination. 
I want to thank my colleagues on the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee for working with me to report 
then re-report Ms. MacGregor’s nomi-
nation, which moved out on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
I thank the majority leader for filing 
cloture on her nomination before the 
recess so we could confirm her this 
week. 
She has a lot of work to do at Inte-
rior, and we need her on the job. She 
did very well at her confirmation hear-
ing last year. She has significant expe-
rience on the issues she will face as 
Deputy Secretary, having worked here 
on Capitol Hill for 10 years, as the prin-
cipal deputy and Assistant Secretary 
for Land and Minerals Management, as 
well as the Department’s Deputy Chief 
of Staff, and, most recently, exercising 
the authority of the Deputy Secretary. 
Ms. 
MacGregor’s 
nomination 
has 
drawn the support of dozens of groups, 
including some in my State: Alaska 
Federation of Natives, Arctic Slope Re-
gional Association, Doyon Limited, 
American Wind Energy Association, 
Congressional 
Sportsmen’s 
Founda-
tion, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation 
Partnership, National Cattlemen’s Beef 
Association, Public Lands Council, and 
many others. 
I personally share those groups’ con-
fidence that Ms. MacGregor will do a 
good job as Deputy Secretary. I think 
she is well qualified. She has the right 
experience to succeed in this role. I 
think she will be a fine asset for Sec-
retary Bernhardt and the rest of the In-
terior team. I would urge my col-
leagues to support her full confirma-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 916 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, later 
this afternoon, we are going to have 
two votes on motions to proceed. They 
are procedural votes to go forward on 
two pieces of legislation relative to the 
issue of abortion. Those of us in public 
life know full well that this is a very 
controversial issue. There are people 
who feel very strongly on one side and 
very strongly on the other. 
These votes this afternoon will not 
resolve that conflict. They don’t try to. 
What the Republican majority under 
Senator MCCONNELL has decided to do 
is to bring back for a vote two items 
we already voted on. We know the out-
come. We can virtually predict within 
one or two votes what it is going to be. 
At the end of the day, Republicans 
will turn to a special interest group 
and say: We told you we could call this 
every year. We did it. 
We will have Members who will vote 
their conscience on both sides of the 
aisle, but the net result of that is not 
going to be to change anything for the 
better in the United States, when it 
comes to the issues that challenge us. 
What I would like to do is to come to 
this floor with a radical idea. I have an 
idea how we can come together, regard-
less of our position on that issue, and 
do something constructive for this 
country. Let me tell you what I have in 
mind. The United States currently 
ranks 32 out of 35 industrial nations 
when it comes to infant mortality. 
That is right—32 out of 35 when it 
comes to the survival of babies in the 
United States once born. 
A 2018 report published in Health Af-
fairs by Global Health characterized 
the United States of America as ‘‘the 
most dangerous of wealthy nations for 
a child to be born into.’’ What they 
found was that U.S. babies—babies 
born in the United States—are three 
times as likely to die of premature 
birth and more than twice as likely to 
die of SIDS than babies in comparably 
rich countries. Every year, more than

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1130 
February 25, 2020 
23,000 infants die in the United States, 
largely due to factors that in many 
cases could have been prevented: low 
birth weight, maternal health com-
plications, prematurity. 
Babies of color are particularly at 
risk. Black infants are twice as likely 
to die in America as White infants, a 
disparity that is greater than it was in 
the year 1850 in this country. 
We are not only losing babies, we are 
losing mothers, as well. Listen to this 
statistic. The United States is one of 
only 13 countries in the world where 
the rate of maternal mortality—moth-
ers dying during the birth process, re-
lated to pregnancy or childbirth, for up 
to a year postpartum—is worse than it 
was 25 years ago. We haven’t moved 
forward. We have moved backward 
when it comes to mothers surviving 
child birth. 
Nationwide, more than 700 women die 
every year as a result of pregnancy and 
more than 70,000 suffer near-fatal com-
plications. More than 660 percent of 
these deaths are preventable. 
Sadly, much like with babies, the 
tragedy of maternal mortality is even 
more pronounced when you look at 
communities of color. In the United 
States of America, women of color are 
three to four times more likely than 
White women to die as a result of preg-
nancy. If you think it has something to 
do with poverty and wealth—that is 
what I thought—there is no correla-
tion. The only correlation is race. 
In my State of Illinois, I am sorry to 
report that if you are an African-Amer-
ican woman, you are six times more 
likely than a White woman to die in 
childbirth. That is why Congressional 
Representative ROBIN
KELLY, in the 
House, 
and 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
TAMMY DUCKWORTH and I, in the Sen-
ate, have joined in introducing the 
MOMMA’s Act. 
First and foremost, more than any-
thing, this bill would expand the length 
of time that a new mother can keep her 
Medicaid health coverage. Currently, 
Medicaid only has to cover women for 
2 months after the child is born. Our 
bill would expand that to a full year. 
The Medicaid Program pays for 50 per-
cent of all births nationwide—44 per-
cent in Illinois. It is a big part of the 
treatment of women who are giving 
birth to children. This program is vital 
for new moms and babies, and it makes 
no sense that a new mom’s health cov-
erage is terminated 2 months after she 
has given birth. Why don’t we stick 
with her so she can live? Why don’t we 
do something affirmative to say that 
we are committed to mothers and chil-
dren on a bipartisan basis, regardless of 
our position on any other issue? 
The MOMMA’s Act would also pro-
vide access to doulas, as well as im-
prove implicit bias and cultural com-
petency training among healthcare 
providers. Too often Black women are 
ignored or not taken seriously by 
healthcare providers. Doulas can help 
provide education advocacy and sup-
port for women whose voices today are 
being ignored. Our bill would establish 
national obstetric emergency protocols 
and ensure dissemination of the best 
practices for healthcare providers deal-
ing with moms and babies. Finally, it 
would help to standardize maternal and 
infant health data collection reporting 
so we have a better idea of what is hap-
pening and why. 
Our bill is supported by the American 
Medical Association, Families USA, 
the March of Dimes, the American Col-
lege 
of 
Obstetricians 
and 
Gyne-
cologists, the Society for Maternal- 
Fetal Medicine, and the Black Mamas 
Matter Alliance. Our bill is supported 
by these and many other public health 
and provider organizations because it 
would save the lives and improve the 
lives of moms and babies. 
We can debate the issue of abortion 
back and forth all day. We know how 
the votes are going to turn out, and we 
know nothing is going to occur. Why 
don’t we come together on something 
bipartisan that says we are all dedi-
cated to reducing the incidence of in-
fant mortality and maternal mortality 
in this country? Isn’t that one thing we 
can agree on? That is my challenge to 
this Senate Chamber. 
Leader MCCONNELL has made it clear 
that he has no intention of allowing 
the Senate to debate and pass legisla-
tion that will actually help families in 
need. I hope he is wrong. Instead, he 
wants us only to vote on controversial 
judicial 
nominees 
and 
politically 
charged anti-choice legislation that 
has no chance of passing. If he is seri-
ous about wanting to save the lives of 
babies and their mothers, I hope that 
he will make an exception for the 
MOMMA’s Act. 
I would like to make a unanimous 
consent request. 
I ask unanimous consent that the Fi-
nance Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 916, the 
Mothers and Offspring Mortality and 
Morbidity Awareness Act, also known 
as the MOMMA’s Act; that the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed; and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I would like 
to address Senator DURBIN’s comments 
and his unanimous consent request 
through the Chair. 
First, I am glad the Senator from Il-
linois wants to reduce infant mortality 
rates and wants to reduce maternal 
mortality rates. I agree on both of 
these goals. 
On the subject of infant mortality, 
the Senate is going to vote on one in-
fant mortality bill in about an hour. 
The senior Senator from Illinois said a 
moment ago that there are two anti- 
choice pieces of legislation this after-
noon. For reporters and the public pay-
ing attention, LINDSEY GRAHAM’s bill is 
about abortion. I support Senator GRA-
HAM’s bill. I don’t exactly agree with 
the characterization of it as leading 
with the anti-choice language, but it is 
an abortion bill. 
The second piece of legislation we are 
considering today is not in any way an 
abortion bill. The anti-choice legisla-
tion 
rhetoric 
that 
you 
are 
using 
doesn’t have anything to do with the 
actual legislation that we are consid-
ering this afternoon. 
Yet I hope that you would consider 
on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act the fact that it is ad-
dressing some cases of mortality by 
making sure babies who have survived 
abortion get care. These are babies who 
are already born and outside the moth-
er. 
The 
Senator’s 
passionate 
speech 
about infant mortality suggests that 
either we are doing more cynical pos-
turing around here or that folks plan 
to actually support this bipartisan 
piece of legislation. I hope it is the lat-
ter. I sincerely hope that the Senator 
would vote in accord with the positions 
he took earlier in his career and that 
we would vote in favor getting impor-
tant stuff done on this legislation. 
In addition, as for the comments he 
made on the subject of maternal mor-
tality rates, I agree with him. Many of 
these tragedies are preventable and, I 
believe, despite being the second or 
third or fourth most conservative 
Member of the Senate by my voting 
record and believing in small govern-
ment, I agree we underfund a lot of 
these pieces of public health invest-
ment, and I would like us to do more to 
address preventable maternal tragedies 
as well. 
Therefore, in a moment, I am going 
to ask if the senior Senator from Illi-
nois would agree to modify his unani-
mous consent request to include the 
Grassley amendment. I will use all of 
the appropriate parliamentary lan-
guage at the end but, for public under-
standing, this amendment, the Grass-
ley amendment, would give States $2.5 
billion new dollars to address maternal 
health and at-risk communities. In ad-
dition, this amendment would give $200 
million to address maternal mortality 
under the Maternal and Child Health 
Services Block Grant Program. We are 
talking about more funding, fully off-
set, for at-risk moms—no politics, no 
gimmicks. It is in line with the policies 
that the senior Senator from Illinois 
was just advancing. 
It is my belief the pro-life position is 
pro-baby, pro-mom, and pro-science. If 
the Senator from Illinois wants to 
spend another $2.7 billion to help 
moms, I am aligned with him. It would 
be great if we could get that done for-
ever. If, however, we are trying to 
change the subject from the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act and 
that means we can’t advance a deal to 
protect these moms and babies, that 
would be disappointing. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senator modify his request to include

the Grassley substitute amendment, 
which is No. 1240. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Finance Committee be 
discharged from its consideration and 
that the amendment be considered 
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. I do not question the 
sincerity of my colleague. I know you 
come to this issue with a sincere heart. 
I don’t question that at all. What I am 
saying to you is that you and I could 
spend the rest of this day and the next 
on this floor debating the issue of abor-
tion, and we are not going to resolve 
it—not in this Chamber, not in this 
country. 
What I am asking you to do is look 
beyond the current issues that are 
coming to the floor this afternoon and 
try to find some common ground—Re-
publicans and Democrats—on the issue 
of maternal mortality. 
You have to be shocked, as I am, to 
read these numbers about the babies 
and mothers who are dying, particu-
larly babies and mothers of color. If we 
can do something as a nation to show 
we truly do care about this, even 
though we have differences on this 
issue of abortion, wouldn’t that be a 
breakthrough 
for this Chamber? I 
think the people across this country 
would applaud us and say: They finally 
did something. They finally came to an 
agreement. 
What I propose is the MOMMA’s Act, 
which is a good bill and is one that I 
think should pass. The Senator has 
proposed an alternative. Here is an 
idea. Listen to this radical idea: What 
if we bring the MOMMA’s Act to the 
floor and agree that we will debate an 
amendment—any 
amendment 
one 
would want to offer? Do you know what 
it would be? It would be like the U.S. 
Senate. It would be the Senate. Think 
of it. The Senator as a Republican and 
I as a Democrat would actually be de-
bating an issue that would make a dif-
ference in America. We would be put-
ting our best ideas up for a vote on the 
Senate floor. How about that for a mo-
tion? 
We are not going to get anywhere 
with the Senator’s proposal this after-
noon, because we have passed it before. 
We know the outcome. We know the 
final vote. I would say the Senator’s al-
ternative proposal, which was once of-
fered by Senator GRASSLEY on the floor 
when I tried this before, is just inad-
equate. The resources aren’t there to 
deal with the scope and gravity of the 
problem. 
So why don’t we do this? Why don’t 
we act like Senators? Why don’t we do 
something on a bipartisan basis and 
bring an issue to the floor that truly 
counts and that people care about? It 
would be a breakthrough. It might 
make a headline. It might even make a 
tweet somewhere. This is not the way 
to do it—that it is the Senator’s way or 
my way. 
What I would suggest to the Senator, 
though, is to bring it to the floor and 
to join me in doing it on a bipartisan 
basis. Appeal to Senator MCCONNELL to 
finally let the Senate be the Senate. 
The Senator knows we have people who 
come to the Galleries here who look 
down at these desks and say: You 
know, I think there used to be Sen-
ators who sat at those desks who actu-
ally legislated, who actually debated, 
who actually had amendments. Last 
year, under Senator MCCONNELL, we 
had 22 amendments on the floor of the 
Senate. Why not more than 22? 
That is it. We are not talking about 
anything else. If the Senator truly 
wants to join me on this floor in a bi-
partisan debate on this issue of infant 
and maternal mortality, let’s do it. For 
the time being, I have to object to 
what the Senator has proposed. Please, 
I didn’t question the Senator’s sin-
cerity in bringing up this issue, and I 
hope he won’t question mine in sug-
gesting we ought to be the Senate and 
debate this issue. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there an objection to the original 
request? 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, in re-
serving the right to object and in turn-
ing this all the way around, we have an 
objection to an objection to an objec-
tion, but let me just agree to the last 
point my colleague from Illinois made. 
I think it would be great if this 
Chamber had 80 or 90 or 95 or 100 people 
in it instead of how it is now. We are at 
three today, which is a high-water 
mark. Usually, there are one or two 
people in here. Senator BARRASSO is 
here. We have four. We are setting a 
record. 
I don’t think a lot of us think that 
the month we all spent here was ideal. 
Last month, during the impeachment, 
there was one thing that was new in 
that a lot of Senators spent time talk-
ing to each other. So, to the Senator’s 
grand point of wishing we were debat-
ing, we are aligned. 
I do want to say one more thing be-
fore I object, which is the Senator said 
he is not questioning my sincerity. I 
appreciate that. The Senator asked 
that I not question his sincerity, and I 
am not. I am questioning his logic, 
though, because he summarized it as if 
there were two issues at play. He said 
anti-abortion legislation and maternal 
health funding. Yet there are three 
issues at play on the floor today. 
One of them is LINDSEY GRAHAM’s 
pain-capable bill, which is a pro-life 
piece of legislation. One of them is 
Senator 
DURBIN’s 
funding 
request 
about maternal delivery health. Those 
things are true, but there is a third 
thing which, again, he obscured by say-
ing the debate here is that of funding 
maternal health or of having anti-abor-
tion legislation. The piece of legisla-
tion we are voting on today—the Born- 
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection 
Act—is not about abortion. I am pro- 
life, and I am going to support LINDSEY 
GRAHAM’s bill. Yet the bill we are vot-
ing on does not change anyone’s access 
to abortion. It doesn’t have anything 
to do with Roe v. Wade. It is about ba-
bies who are already born. This morn-
ing on TV, those on CNN made up this 
insane phrase. They said it was a fetus 
that had been born. What the heck is 
that? It is another way of saying they 
don’t want to debate the actual debate 
we are having on the floor today. 
We are going to vote once on LINDSEY 
GRAHAM’s pro-life legislation, and I am 
going to support it. We are also going 
to vote on a piece of legislation called 
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act. These are about babies 
who are born, who are outside their 
mothers. What is actually happening is 
that the senior Senator from Illinois is 
wanting to obscure the debate because 
he wants to use euphemisms about 
choice so that we don’t have to admit 
to the American public that what is ac-
tually happening on the floor today is 
probably going to be like it was last 
year—with 44 Democrats filibustering 
an anti-infanticide bill. 
There is nothing in the bill that is 
about abortion—nothing. It is about in-
fanticide. That is the actual legisla-
tion. We have 44 people over there who 
want to hide from it and talk in euphe-
misms about abortion because they 
don’t want to defend the indefensible 
because they can’t defend the indefen-
sible. We are talking about killing ba-
bies who are born. That is the actual 
legislation we are voting on today in 
the Senate. That is what the Born- 
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection 
Act is. Is it OK in the eyes of the U.S. 
Senate for us to say: ‘‘Well, you can’t 
actively kill the little baby. You can’t 
take a pillow and put it over her face 
and smother her to death, but you can 
back away and kill her that way’’? 
That is what Ralph Northam—the 
disgraced Governor of Virginia—was 
talking about when he said: Well, once 
the baby is born, if she survives an 
abortion—and we wish that it would 
not happen—then we will figure out a 
way to keep her calm for a little while, 
while the doctors debate what they 
want to do. What he means is, kill the 
baby, and that is the legislation we are 
voting on today. 
There are three buckets. LINDSEY 
GRAHAM’s Pain-Capable Unborn Child 
Protection Act is a bill about abortion. 
There is another bill that is about ba-
bies who have already been born. 
News flash, CNN: If you are a baby 
and if you have been born and if you 
are outside of Mama, nobody calls that 
a fetus. You just want to call it a fetus 
because you don’t want to cover the ac-
tual story that is being voted on in the 
Senate today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1132 
February 25, 2020 
Then there is a third piece of legisla-
tion, which is Senator DURBIN’s coun-
terproposal about maternal prevent-
able deaths and investments in that 
category. I am interested in that cat-
egory as well, but the Senator from Il-
linois doesn’t actually want to talk 
about the legislation that is on the 
floor, so he is changing the subject. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in-
fanticide should be a crime, and it is. 
That is what the Senator from Ne-
braska will not concede. He thinks he 
has come up with a novel idea—that 
you shouldn’t be able to kill a baby 
with impunity in America. It is not 
novel. It has been in Federal law for 
over a decade, and it is in State laws 
all across the United States. If one has 
any doubt about it, be prepared to 
write down a name—the name of 
Kermit Gosnell. Thirteen years ago, I 
believe it was, this physician was con-
victed of infanticide. He is now serving 
life without parole, plus 30 years. To 
argue that the Senator has some novel 
idea that infanticide should be a crime 
and that we don’t cover it now under 
the law is just not accurate, and it is 
not factual. That is why I think the 
Senator’s bill is unnecessary. 
This bill is necessary. Mothers are 
dying and babies are dying, and we can 
do something about it. It doesn’t mat-
ter whether one goes to a pro-life or to 
a pro-choice rally; we all agree that 
this is something we can do on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, just 
for the record and just so we all have it 
clear, the Senator talks about infan-
ticide, and he is right. Active infan-
ticide is illegal under Federal law as 
there are no crimes for it in half of the 
States. 
More fundamentally, what the Sen-
ate is considering today is passive in-
fanticide. Whether they are born in 
glistening NICUs at fancy hospitals, 
with a lot of rich cars in the parking 
lots, or whether the babies are born in 
the unfortunate circumstances of abor-
tion clinics in strip malls, whether 
they are 1 day old or 5 days old, it 
turns out that they die if you wander 
away from them and deny them care. If 
you don’t give them warmth and if you 
don’t give them food, they die. Passive 
killing, passive infanticide, is not ille-
gal under Federal law. 
The Senator said infanticide is ille-
gal, and he is half right. Active infan-
ticide is illegal under Federal law. You 
cannot take a pillow and smother a 
newborn baby to death. What you can 
do and what does happen in abortion 
clinics across America—and it is why 
we held a Judiciary Committee hearing 
on this 2 weeks ago so as to hear from 
medical and legal community experts 
who know what the practice looks 
like—is the taking of that vulnerable, 
innocent, little, tiny fetus, putting her 
on a cart, walking her down the hall, 
putting that cart in a closet, and leav-
ing her to die by exposure. That is 
what we should prevent, and that is 
what this legislation is about. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to support the two 
pro-life bills being considered this 
week and to stand with my friend and 
colleague from Nebraska in his efforts 
to promote the legislation that is be-
fore us, for both of these bills promote 
respect for innocent human life. 
Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM’s Pain-Ca-
pable Unborn Child Protection Act 
would ban nearly all abortions at 20 
weeks of pregnancy. As a doctor, I 
know that it is medically proven that 
babies do feel pain at 20 weeks. Ameri-
cans 
overwhelmingly 
oppose 
these 
third-trimester 
abortions. 
Yet 
the 
United States remains one of only 
seven countries in the world to allow 
abortions after 5 months. This group 
includes China, and it includes North 
Korea. We need to do much better. The 
Graham bill puts us on higher ground 
with the rest of the world. It says, at 5 
months, which is 20 weeks, abortion on 
demand must stop. It includes excep-
tions for rape, for incest, and for the 
life of the mother. I strongly support 
this effort by Senator GRAHAM, and I 
applaud him for his tremendous work 
on this issue. 
I also stand here on the floor to say 
I strongly support what Senator SASSE 
has been saying about his specific bill, 
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act. Senator SASSE is another 
champion on life issues. The Sasse bill 
affirms that infanticide is illegal. It 
upholds the right of all U.S.-born ba-
bies to full medical care. Every baby 
born in this country deserves every 
chance to live. All doctors must do ev-
erything in their power to save babies 
who survive abortions. 
Both the Graham and the Sasse bills 
fully protect mothers from either pros-
ecution or penalty. Both measures 
demonstrate character, and they dem-
onstrate courage. These are bills that 
care for our children, and they do what 
is medically right. 
Thanks to all of those who work to 
protect innocent human life, we are 
here on the floor, debating, promoting, 
and asking for a vote to pass this legis-
lation. I urge all Senators to support 
these life-affirming bills. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
at the heart of this debate is life. When 
I reflect on the importance of pro-
tecting innocent life, the story of Ellie 
Schneider comes to mind. She is a 
child who was born at just 21 weeks 6 
days in Kansas City. Ellie is one of the 
youngest babies to survive, in the 
United States, a premature birth. She 
was born so early that most hospitals 
in Missouri would not treat her, except 
for the faith-based hospital St. Luke’s. 
She weighed only slightly more than 
a can of soda and was about as long as 
a piece of paper. She weighed just 14 
ounces. At 21 weeks, the odds were 
stacked against her, but she is a fight-
er. Through the power of prayer and an 
incredible medical team, Ellie is now a 
healthy, happy 2-year-old girl. She 
brings endless joy to her family. 
Her inclusion in the 
President’s 
State of the Union Address is a power-
ful testament to life. Ellie is an exam-
ple that every child is a blessing wor-
thy of protection, and we have a moral 
obligation to defend the born and un-
born. 
In today’s political climate, it is easy 
to forget that there are both Demo-
crats and Republicans, liberals and 
conservatives, and people from every 
religious affiliation who believe in pro-
tecting the human rights of the un-
born. I am proud to be a cosponsor S. 
311, the Born-Alive Survivors Protec-
tion Act. It sends a clear message by 
establishing the real consequences for 
those who kill or abandon innocent 
children after they are outside the 
mother’s womb. We should all be able 
to agree that once born, each baby de-
serves the right to proper access to 
medical care. 
I also proudly support S. 3275, the 
Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Act, 
which places much needed restrictions 
on elective abortions on children at 20 
weeks post-conception. It is uncon-
scionable that America is one of only 
seven countries that does not have a 
20-week abortion ban. These countries 
include China, North Korea, and Viet-
nam. 
While it is disheartening that this 
type of horrific practice needs congres-
sional action, I am glad there are com-
monsense pieces of legislation that can 
address the atrocities of late-term 
abortion and severely punishes those in 
the business of taking the lives of our 
youngest human beings. 
I pray that the American people will 
recognize that lives hang in the bal-
ance, will stand with us to get our Na-
tion back on the right track, and will 
fight for the born and the unborn. 
Being a voice for the voiceless requires 
us to take important steps, like pass-
ing the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act and the Pain-Capable 
Unborn Protection Act. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1133 
February 25, 2020 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
CAPITO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to oppose my col-
leagues’ legislation that would limit 
women’s 
healthcare 
choices. 
These 
bills that are being introduced are part 
of a wave of efforts to turn back the 
clock on women’s healthcare. 
In my home State of Nevada, with 
the only majority-women legislature in 
the Nation, we are moving in the oppo-
site direction. We have been fighting to 
protect a woman’s right to choose for 
decades. I am inspired by women like 
Sue Wagner, the first woman elected as 
Nevada’s Lieutenant Governor, whose 
grit and leadership sparked a move-
ment in the 1990s to enshrine women’s 
reproductive freedom in the State’s 
constitution. 
Just this year, with women at the 
helm of the Nevada legislature, the 
Trust Nevada Women Act was signed 
into law to remove undue burdens on 
reproductive rights. Nevadans under-
stand that reproductive rights are part 
and parcel not just of women’s health 
but of their economic security. When 
women can’t control whether and when 
they have children, they are more like-
ly to struggle financially. Eighty-three 
percent of Nevadans are pro-choice, 
and I stand with them. 
I am going to continue to fight for 
what the American people want: com-
prehensive healthcare and reproductive 
justice. Bills to protect women’s health 
are what we should be voting on, like 
the bipartisan legislation to cover pre-
existing conditions, to reduce prescrip-
tion drug prices, to prevent violence 
against women, and many more that 
are 
languishing, 
unfortunately, 
on 
Leader MCCONNELL’s desk. That in-
cludes pushing for meaningful legisla-
tion to protect mothers and babies at a 
critical time in their lives, like the 
Healthy 
MOM 
Act 
to 
expand 
healthcare coverage for pregnant and 
postpartum women. 
Leader MCCONNELL is more focused 
on passing an extreme political agenda 
than on protecting women’s health in 
Nevada and across this country. You 
know, we really have to stop the as-
sault on women’s right to choose and 
their 
reproductive 
healthcare. 
The 
rights of American women to make 
their own health decisions should not 
be up for debate. These are our funda-
mental rights, and they are worth 
fighting for and protecting. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, this 
afternoon, we are going to vote on the 
simplest bill in the history of the U.S. 
Senate. It is the simplest bill we have 
ever considered here. It says that if a 
newborn baby survives an abortion, she 
deserves medical care. That is the bill. 
That is it. 
Sadly, a lot of Senators are going to 
come to the floor, and they are going 
to read or they are planning to read— 
I hope they will reconsider—but they 
are planning to read talking points 
that were written for them by Planned 
Parenthood, and they are going to talk 
about a whole bunch of stuff that 
doesn’t have anything to do with the 
bill we actually have before us. 
Senators are going to muddy the 
issue, and, sadly, too many in the press 
are going to report with headlines like 
‘‘Abortion Restrictions’’ and with anti- 
science jargon like ‘‘A Fetus That Was 
Born.’’ That was an actual portion of 
the headline this morning: ‘‘A Fetus 
That Was Born.’’ 
Sadly, a lot of folks seem determined 
to look the other way. Looking the 
other way from the issue that we are 
considering 
today 
in 
this 
body 
shouldn’t be an option, so let’s start 
with four straight, undeniable facts— 
four simple facts. 
First, Federal law does not crim-
inalize the denial of care to newborn 
babies who survive abortions. Federal 
law doesn’t criminalize the denial of 
care to babies who survive abortions. 
Second, we know that babies some-
times survive abortions, and the data 
backs that up. If Senators don’t like 
this inconvenient fact, they can take it 
up with the CDC and the States that 
have mandatory reporting about babies 
who survive abortions. 
Third, this bill, the Born-Alive Abor-
tion Survivors Protection Act, simply 
says that if a baby survives an abor-
tion, she should get the same degree of 
medical care that any other baby 
would get at that same gestational 
stage. It is really important—same 
care that would be provided to any 
other baby at the same gestational 
stage. 
It is a short bill. I know my col-
leagues are busy, but all of them could 
read the bill. So instead of coming to 
the floor and reciting prepackaged 
talking points that Planned Parent-
hood wrote for you, take a few minutes 
and actually read the bill, and you will 
find that the talking points don’t actu-
ally match up with the actual bill you 
are called on to vote on today. Those 
are the facts. 
Finally, this is not about abortion. 
My colleague, the senior Senator from 
South Carolina, the chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee, has a really im-
portant piece of legislation that he is 
going to speak on in a moment, and I 
am going to support his legislation. It 
is a really important pro-life piece of 
legislation. I am in favor of it. 
But my legislation, the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act, is 
not actually about abortion. It is about 
babies who have already survived a 
botched abortion. My legislation is not 
about Roe v. Wade. It is about what 
happens after a baby is already born 
when an abortion failed to accomplish 
the purpose it had—the sad purpose, in 
my view—the purpose it had to termi-
nate that pregnancy. This is about the 
babies who have already been born. 
This is about whether that baby who 
has survived the abortion and is now 
lying on the abortion table or on the 
medical table—whether or not that 
cold, naked baby alone has a right to 
medical care. 
We all know the answer. The answer 
is, of course she does. Every baby dies 
if you leave her to passively die of ex-
posure. Whether she was born in a gold- 
plated hospital with a lot of fancy, ex-
pensive cars in the parking lot outside 
that NICU unit or whether she was 
born in the unfortunate circumstances 
of an abortion clinic in a strip mall, 
every little baby who has already been 
born—they will die if you deny care to 
them. So, of course, we shouldn’t do 
that. Of course, the U.S. Senate should 
stand up and defend those babies. 
We all know that denying care to the 
most vulnerable among us is barbaric, 
and this body ought to be able to stand 
100 to 0 against that barbarism. It is in-
humane, and it is passive infanticide, 
and the Senate should today condemn 
and prohibit that practice. Is that 
practice what my colleagues really 
want to defend? I can’t believe they do. 
The 44 who filibustered this legisla-
tion a year ago this week, when you 
talk to them one to one, they get real-
ly uncomfortable, and they try to 
change the subject to all sorts of other 
culture war debates because they don’t 
want to have a conversation about the 
actual legislation and the actual babies 
we are considering today. Why? Be-
cause they are scared to death of 
Planned Parenthood’s army of lobby-
ists, that is why. It is not because any 
of them really want to defend the mor-
ally reprehensible and the morally in-
defensible practice that is passive in-
fanticide. None of them want to defend 
it. They are just scared. 
Last year, 44 Senators filibustered 
this legislation. They said that it was 
OK to look the other way while 
newborns were discarded. They said 
that Federal law should not ensure 
that these babies are treated with care. 
They seem to have a hard time saying 
that human beings outside the womb 
have the same right to life as you and 
I ought to have and that we get care; 
we need care. They need care, and they 
should get care. 
Put down your talking points. Please 
read the bill before you vote today. 
Read the expert testimony that the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee 
allowed us to hold in his committee 
room 2 weeks ago, where we brought in 
both medical and legal experts to talk 
about what happens in these abortion 
clinics. 
For those in this body who are not on 
the Judiciary Committee or who didn’t 
do the preparation for today’s vote, I 
want to summarize the testimony of 
one of the people who came before our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1134 
February 25, 2020 
Judiciary 
Committee—Jill 
Stanek, 
who now works for the Susan B. An-
thony List. She was at an Illinois hos-
pital in the 1990s and early 2000s. Here 
is a quote from her: 
Of 16 babies Christ Hospital aborted during 
the calendar year 2000, four that I knew of 
[were born alive, and they] were aborted 
alive. 
That is 25 percent—4 out of the 16 
abortions at that hospital. 
She continues: 
Each of those babies—[there were] two 
boys and two girls—lived [somewhere] be-
tween 11⁄2 and 3 hours. One baby was 28 
weeks’ gestation [age]—7 months old—and 
weighed two pounds, seven ounces. 
Numbers from the CDC and the 
States that report data on abortion 
survivors—that is about 8 of the 50 
States that do some reporting and data 
collection on this—tell a story of ba-
bies who were breathing, whose hearts 
were 
beating, 
who stretched their 
arms, wiggled their fingers, and kicked 
their legs. This is the actual data. You 
want to talk about being pro-science— 
being pro-science is pro-baby. 
What happened to the babies? Med-
ical practitioners have testified before 
Congress about walking into rooms 
where living babies were lying naked 
and alone on countertops, where they 
would be left to expire by themselves— 
alone, cold, naked, and denied care. 
Opponents of this bill don’t want to 
deal with the facts. They prefer to 
stick to talking points and claim that 
this never happens. If they will not lis-
ten to the medical experts, perhaps 
they will take the word of the Gov-
ernor of Virginia, Ralph Northam. 
In January of last year, disgraced 
Governor Northam was explicit during 
a radio interview in which he said that 
a baby born alive during an abortion 
‘‘would be kept comfortable. . . . then 
a 
discussion 
would 
ensue’’ 
about 
whether that baby should be left to die. 
That 
is 
actually 
what 
Governor 
Northam was talking about on the 
radio in Virginia. 
What he did is make the terrible faux 
pas of saying in public the true stuff 
about this procedure and this practice 
of walking away and backing away 
from these babies and letting them die. 
He just decided to talk in public about 
the reality of what happens in some of 
these abortion clinics. 
Governor Northam is not an outlier. 
Just 3 weeks ago, one of the Demo-
cratic candidates for President was 
asked point blank on national tele-
vision about infanticide: Would he be 
comfortable if a mother invoked infan-
ticide to kill her now already born- 
alive 
child? 
Mayor 
Buttigieg’s 
re-
sponse: ‘‘I don’t know what I’d tell 
them.’’ 
Really? Somebody asks you if you 
can kill a baby who has already been 
born, and you say you don’t know what 
to say? 
Every one of us, especially somebody 
running for the highest office in the 
land to uphold the laws—laws that 
promise to protect the right to life— 
should be able to say without any hesi-
tation that leaving babies to die is un-
acceptable. 
This isn’t horrid stuff, people. There 
are actually some horrid debates we 
have in this Chamber. This isn’t one of 
them. This is about babies who have 
been born alive and whether you can 
decide to kill them. There is really no 
debate to be had here, which is why so 
many people who were planning to 
speak on the other side decided not to 
speak this afternoon, because you can’t 
defend the morally reprehensible pro-
cedure that is backing away, that is 
passive infanticide. 
There are no exceptions. There are no 
special circumstances. We should pro-
tect every human being, no matter how 
small they are, no matter how weak 
they are. And if the Senate says that it 
is OK to ignore born-alive babies, what 
we are really saying is that we are OK 
with a society where some people count 
more than other people. We would be 
saying that we want a society where 
some people can be pushed aside if 
other people decide those folks are in-
convenient, a society where we can dis-
pose of you if you happen to come into 
the world a certain way. 
It 
is 
unbelievably 
telling 
that 
Planned Parenthood, NARAL, which is 
the extremist abortion lobby and their 
armies of lawyers and slick public rela-
tions teams and influence peddlers, 
cannot draw this line. It is pretty 
amazing. 
This bill is not about abortion. 
Again, I want to be clear. We are vot-
ing on two things today. One of them is 
a piece of legislation about abortion. It 
is the pain-capable bill. LINDSEY GRA-
HAM, the chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, is going to speak in favor 
of it in a minute. I am an original co-
sponsor of his legislation. I support it, 
and I am going to wholeheartedly vote 
for it. 
But the other piece of legislation we 
are going to vote on today isn’t actu-
ally even about abortion. This should 
be 100-to-0 no-brainer. This bill is not 
about Roe v. Wade. This bill will not 
change one word of abortion law in the 
United States. My colleagues can vote 
up or down, but they can’t pretend that 
they don’t know the stakes of what we 
are talking about. 
America is a country built on the 
beautiful principle of equality, and the 
terms of the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act are intended to 
reflect that. A child born alive during a 
botched abortion should be given the 
same level of care that would be pro-
vided to any other baby born at that 
same gestational stage, which is just to 
say that a born-alive baby is a human 
being with fundamental human dig-
nity, which is undeniable. They should 
receive the care and affection due to 
every other human being. 
Today, we have a chance to advance 
our commitment to human dignity. We 
can protect those babies who come into 
the world under the worst of condi-
tions. We can welcome them into a 
world with love and hope and help and 
care. 
My colleagues, please do not turn 
your backs on those babies. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. 
INHOFE. 
Madam 
President, 
today, we will be voting on two very 
important bills: the Pain-Capable Un-
born Child Protection Act and the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act. I would like to thank my col-
leagues Senator GRAHAM and Senator 
SASSE
for their leadership on these 
bills, and I would like to thank Senator 
MCCONNELL, for his efforts to bring 
these bills to the floor for a vote. 
First, I want to talk about Senator 
Sasse’s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act, a bill which I have co-
sponsored that would ensure that a 
baby who survives an abortion will re-
ceive the same treatment as any child 
naturally born at the same age, with-
out prescribing any particular form of 
treatment. 
That is just morally right, and I 
don’t see why there would be any dis-
agreement about it. This bill is not 
even about abortion; it is about infan-
ticide. 
Twenty-eight years ago, I came down 
here to tell the story of Ana Rosa 
Rodriguez. Here is what I said: 
Mr. Chairman, there is a big misconception 
regarding abortion and the issue of women 
and their right to protect their bodies. It is 
not that right that I object to, but the right 
that is given them to kill an unborn fetus— 
an unborn child. 
I want to share with you a story that my 
colleague, Chris Smith told some time ago 
on this very floor. Ana Rosa Rodriguez is an 
abortion survivor. At birth she was a healthy 
3 pound baby girl except for her injury—she 
was missing an arm. 
Ana survived a botched abortion. Her 
mother attempted to get an abortion in her 
32nd week of pregnancy when she was per-
fectly healthy—8 weeks past what New York 
State law legally allows. In the unsuccessful 
abortion attempt the baby’s right arm was 
ripped off, however they failed to kill Ana 
Rosa. She lived. 
Pro-life supporters agreed that nightmare 
situations like the Rodriguez case are prob-
ably not common, but abortion related 
deaths and serious injuries occur more fre-
quently than most people are aware. 
It is amazing that we can pay so much at-
tention to issues such as human rights 
abroad and can allow the violent destruction 
of over 26 million children here at home. We 
are fortunate that Ana was not one of those 
children-she survived. 
That was in 1992. But today, we still 
don’t have explicit Federal protections 
for the babies who survive the brutal 
abortion process. As I said, this issue is 
not about abortion but about caring for 
a baby outside the womb. 
The need for these protections has 
become even clearer as we see States 
like New York and Illinois allow abor-
tion for virtually any reason up until 
the point of birth and support infan-
ticide by removing protections for in-
fants born alive after a failed abortion. 
Just a few years after that speech, in 
1997, I was on the floor with my good 
friend former Senator Rick Santorum 
to try to pass the partial-birth abor-
tion ban and end the horrific practice

of late-term abortions. Fortunately, we 
won the battle against partial-birth 
abortions and finally ended that prac-
tice in 2003. That ban was upheld by the 
Supreme Court in 2007. 
But we have yet to pass legislation 
banning late term abortion. 
Only seven countries allow abortion 
after 20 weeks, including the United 
States and North Korea. That is hor-
rific. The U.S. is supposed to be an ex-
ample in regards to global human 
rights; yet we are on par with North 
Korea when it comes to protecting the 
unborn. 
Senator GRAHAM’s Pain Capable Un-
born Child Protection Act would help 
roll back this horrific practice by pro-
hibiting abortion after 20 weeks post- 
fertilization, when we know babies can 
feel pain. 
This is another commonsense bill 
that should not divide us along par-
tisan lines; a baby is a baby whether in 
or outside of the womb, and each baby 
deserves a chance to live as an indi-
vidual created in the image of God. 
There still much more we need to do 
to end the abortion on demand culture, 
but thankfully, we have the most pro- 
life President in history. 
This January, President Trump be-
came the first sitting President to at-
tend the annual March for Life rally in 
Washington. Hundreds of pro-life Okla-
homans joined the President and tens 
of thousands of Americans to march. I 
had the chance to meet many of these 
Oklahomans, many of them extremely 
young—as young as high school. They 
asked me how to respond when the rad-
ical left attacks their views. I told 
them to be kind, but not to be afraid to 
voice their opinions—after all, they are 
right. 
Under President Trump’s leadership, 
we have protected the Hyde amend-
ment, reinstated and expanded the 
Mexico City policy, and stripped abor-
tion providers like Planned Parenthood 
from using title X funding for abor-
tions. 
The need to stand up for our babies is 
as important today as it was in 1992 
and 1997. I am looking forward to build-
ing on our successes under President 
Trump to end the practice of abortion 
on demand and to ensure that we pro-
tect babies who survive abortions. 
We will overcome evil with good by 
upholding and affirming the dignity 
and inherent worth of every human 
being. We will keep fighting. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
rise in opposition to S. 3275, the Pain- 
Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, 
and S. 311, the Born-Alive Abortion 
Protection Act. These two dangerous 
bills infringe on the doctor-patient re-
lationship and hinder women’s con-
stitutionally protected right to choose. 
Make no mistake, these bills are noth-
ing more than a reminder that Repub-
lican discrimination toward women 
knows 
no 
boundaries. 
President 
Trump, his administration, and Senate 
Republicans think reproductive free-
dom is still up for discussion. It is not. 
I am here to set the record straight 
for Leader MITCH MCCONNELL and my 
Republican colleagues. Women’s repro-
ductive health decisions should be left 
to women and their healthcare pro-
viders. That is it. 
This time last year, the Born-Alive 
Abortion Protection Act failed to ad-
vance on the Senate floor. I was proud 
to vote against this bill then, and I 
hope more of my colleagues will join 
me in voting no on this bill now. Doing 
so will safeguard the right for an indi-
vidual to make their own health 
choices, without interference from the 
Federal Government. 
The Senate floor is not the only bat-
tleground for reproductive rights. Anti- 
Choice State legislators are continuing 
to 
assault 
reproductive 
freedom 
through the enactment of State laws 
restricting choice. Cases challenging 
these laws are working their way 
through the judicial system, including 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. There, the 
laws’ supporters hope that the conserv-
ative justices will not only uphold 
these damaging laws but will go fur-
ther and overturn Roe v. Wade, effec-
tively ending this bedrock decision 
that ensures equality, privacy, and re-
productive freedom. 
Women across the Nation are facing 
imminent threats to their constitu-
tional rights, to their personal liberty, 
and to economic freedom. Now more 
than ever, we must do everything in 
our power to raise our voices against 
this extreme, rightwing agenda of dis-
crimination. This is more than a de-
bate about access to safe abortion serv-
ices. This is about fighting for gender 
equality. This is about continuing to 
ensure access to the opportunity that 
comes 
from 
quality, 
affordable 
healthcare. And this is about making 
sure 
that 
access 
to 
reproductive 
healthcare is never restricted. 
Women’s rights are not negotiable. 
Republicans may intend to continue 
advancing their radical anti-choice 
agenda, but I will never back away 
from the fight against it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, be-
fore Senator SASSE leaves, I say to the 
Senator, I just can’t thank you enough 
for the passion and the persuasion you 
bring to these issues. You speak from 
the heart. You speak with reason. You 
make a lot of sense, and over time, you 
will prevail. Just stick with it. Your 
day will come. 
What he is saying is, if you try to 
abort a child, and the child survives 
the abortion, shouldn’t the doctor and 
the nurses and everybody involved 
treat the child the same as if they 
came into the world some other way? I 
think the answer is yes. 
Really, these two pieces of legisla-
tion are about us as a nation. This is 
2020. Who are we as Americans? To me 
it is odd that we even need to have a 
discussion about this. I am just per-
plexed that this is even a problem. 
Abortion is legal in the United 
States. There are certain restrictions 
on it, but I just can’t believe we can’t 
rally around the idea that if a baby 
survives the procedure and is alive and 
breathing and functioning, medical 
science doesn’t kick in to save the 
baby. It is just—I don’t know. I don’t 
know what happened. What happened 
to our country that we are even talk-
ing about this? It is 2020, for God’s 
sake. It is not 1020. 
Anyway, just hang in there, Ben. 
Your day will come. 
My legislation—I have been doing 
this for a few years now. We are one of 
seven nations in the world that allow 
abortion on demand at 20 weeks, along 
with North Korea, Vietnam, China, 
Singapore, the Netherlands, and Can-
ada. What would this legislation do at 
20 weeks? This is about the fifth month 
in the birthing process. 
The bill is called the Pain-Capable 
Unborn Child Protection Act. Why do 
we call it that? Medical science has de-
termined that a child at 20 weeks is ca-
pable of feeling excruciating pain. So if 
there is an operation to save a child’s 
life or to repair a medical defect at 20 
weeks, they provide anesthesia to the 
child because, during the surgery, the 
child feels pain. You can see that when 
a child is poked, they actually repel 
against the poking. 
The bottom line is, I find it odd that 
medical science requires anesthesia to 
save the baby’s life, but during that 
same period, you can dismember the 
child. That is what we are talking 
about here. 
What kind of Nation are we if, at the 
fifth month—this is 20 weeks into the 
birthing process—we are one of seven 
nations that allow abortion on de-
mand? There are exceptions for the life 
of the mother—that hard decision if 
the mother’s life is impacted by the 
child, and we will leave that up to the 
family—and if the pregnancy is as a re-
sult of rape or incest. But beyond that, 
we want to eliminate abortion on de-
mand at the 20-week period because, I 
would argue, that doesn’t make us a 
better nation. It doesn’t advance any-
body’s cause. 
The bottom line is, based on medical 
science, we know that this child has 
nerve endings intact. Medical encyclo-
pedias encourage young parents to sing 
to their unborn child during this period 
of development because they can begin 
to associate their voice and recognize 
who they are. I find it odd that we 
would encourage young parents to sing 
to their unborn child at 20 weeks; we 
require anesthesia to save the child’s 
life; but we are also a country that al-
lows the child to be dismembered. It 
makes no sense to me. They have ex-
ceptions that make sense: life of the 
mother, the result of rape or incest 
where there is no choice at all. 
The bottom line is that these two 
pieces of legislation are going to con-
tinue to be advanced until they pass. It 
takes a while for America to kind of 
get focused on what we are saying here 
because abortion is an uncomfortable 
topic to talk about, particularly in the

early stages of the pregnancy. But 
what Senator SASSE is saying is that in 
the case of the child surviving an abor-
tion, there is really not much to talk 
about. We should protect the life that 
is now a being. The baby survived. I 
don’t know why the baby survived. I 
don’t know how the baby survived. I 
just know that decent people would 
want to come to the child’s aid once 
she does survive. 
Just imagine what it must be like, 
after the baby survives the abortion, to 
be left unattended for 11⁄2 to 3 hours. 
That says a lot about us as a nation. I 
just think we are better than that. 
It is kind of odd that we even have to 
have this debate, but apparently we do 
because this happens more than you 
would ever think. Babies actually sur-
vive abortion, and the rules in this 
country are that you just let it die. 
There is no longer required care. That, 
to me, as Senator SASSE said, is bar-
baric. It doesn’t make us a better peo-
ple, and it really doesn’t affect the 
abortion debate because the baby sur-
vived. 
My legislation is about us as a nation 
too. How does abortion on demand in 
the fifth month advance the cause of 
America? I don’t think it does. 
We have exceptions in those in-
stances where it is a tragic choice be-
tween the life of the mother and the 
unborn child and in the cases of rape or 
incest, which are tragic and criminal, 
but generally speaking, we would like 
to get ourselves out of a club of seven 
nations that allow abortion on demand 
at a time when the parents are encour-
aged to sing to the child and you have 
to provide anesthesia to save the 
child’s life because you would not want 
to operate on a baby in a fashion to 
hurt the child. 
I dare say that if you are a doctor 
and you try to save the baby’s life at 20 
weeks through surgery and you don’t 
provide anesthesia, you are going to 
wind up getting yourself in trouble. I 
find it odd that the law would allow 
the dismemberment of the child even 
with anesthesia, but that is where we 
are. 
To Senator SASSE, I say that you are 
an articulate spokesman for your legis-
lation. One day, we will prevail. It took 
15 years to pass the late-term abortion 
ban. It is going to take a while, but our 
day will come. 
At the end of the day, the sooner 
America can get this right, the better 
off we will be. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Judge of the United States Tax Court 
for a term of fifteen years. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

ABORTION 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
rise to have a dialogue. Let me start it 
this way. My brother and I did not al-
ways agree on things. I know that may 
be shocking that two brothers did not 
get along on everything. Maybe in your 
house you got along on everything, but 
my brother and I, growing up, did not 
agree on everything. 
In fact, growing up, I distinctly re-
member the day we reached epic levels, 
and we actually got masking tape out 
in our room and put a line down the 
floor that ran from one wall across to 
the other wall. We had an old-school 
stereo record player in our room. The 
line ran up the record player so that on 
one side he had the tuning knob and on 
the other side I had the volume knob. 
We would have to reach some sort of 
detente to listen to anything. If he 
turned it to a station I didn’t like, I 
could turn the volume all the way 
down. We would have to work things 
out. The line even went through our 
closet, with his clothes and my clothes 
on it, and we had a clear line of separa-
tion that you could not cross that line. 
The rules were very clear in our room. 
For whatever reason, our mom put up 
with it for quite a while as we had our 
‘‘Don’t cross the line into my side’’ 
kind of moment. 
It is interesting that today in the 
Senate there was in some ways kind of 
a line-drawing moment to not draw a 
line but to try to figure out where are 
our lines, where are our boundaries on 
an issue that Americans talk about all 
the time, in many ways, but always get 
nervous in that dialogue. It is the issue 
about when is a child a child. 
We have this weird dialogue as a na-
tion because we have a great passion 
for children. We spend a tremendous 
amount of money, personally, on our 
families and in our communities and in 
nonprofits and Federal taxpayer dol-
lars to walk alongside children to do 
everything we can to protect the lives 
of those children. 
We have some in this body who have 
proposed Federal taxpayer dollars for 
children in their very first days of life 
to have childcare that is available for 
them, but literally 3 days before that, 
they have also proposed Federal tax 
dollars for abortion to take that life. 
It begs the question: Where is your 
line on life? What is that moment? For 
me, I go with the science. It is concep-
tion. That is a dividing cell that has 
DNA that is different than the mom 
and different than the dad. That divid-
ing cell is a uniquely different person. 
Every science textbook, every medical 
textbook that you look at would iden-
tify that DNA is different than any 
other DNA in the world. That is a dif-
ferent person. As those cells grow and 
divide and as that child grows and di-
vides, whether they are 50 years old or 
whether they are only days old still in 
womb, the DNA is the same. All the 
building blocks are in that child from 
their earliest days. 
Others will look at it and will ask 
the question—like the Supreme Court 
did in 1973, when they ruled on Roe v. 
Wade on the issue of viability. That is 
when the Supreme Court said, in 1973, 
that States can engage and try to 
make some laws dealing with abortion, 
which is based around this issue of via-
bility. Viability, in 1973, is very dif-
ferent than it is now. We have many 
children who are born at 21, 22, 23, 24 
weeks gestation who are prematurely 
delivered, spend months in a NICU fa-
cility, and thrive as adults. That via-
bility question is different now than it 
was in 1973, but we also know more 
about the science now than we knew at 
that time as well. 
We know that a child—some would 
say on the science side of it—as early 
as 12 weeks old of development, still in 
the womb, can feel and experience 
pain. Certainly, by 20 weeks, 21, 22 
weeks, they have developed a brain and 
have developed a nervous system. The 
system of experiencing pain is all in 
place. If anything happens to that 
child, that child will experience the 
pain and the effects of that. 
The New York Times had a really in-
teresting article in October 2017, talk-
ing about a young man, Charley Royer. 
When he was just at 24 weeks develop-
ment in the womb, the parents made a 
very difficult decision to have a sur-
gery in utero. It is spina bifida. The 
child would be paralyzed. The New 
York Times writes about how they did 
this surgery—this very intricate sur-
gery—that happened at Texas Chil-
dren’s Hospital at Baylor College of 
Medicine. They basically delivered the 
child, doing surgery on that child, re-
inserting the uterus and the child back 
into the mom’s womb, and then stayed 
all the way through until full gestation 
and was delivered. 
Charley is apparently doing very 
well. It was a remarkable surgery. Dur-
ing that surgery, they made sure they 
helped that child and gave him addi-
tional medications to protect him from 
pain because they were doing surgery 
on someone who felt the effects of the 
surgery at 24 weeks. 
Today we had a vote in the Senate to 
ask Senators, if you don’t agree with 
me on this that the line should be con-
ception, to consider that child a child 
at conception, would you consider that 
child a child when they can experience 
pain? They have a beating heart. They 
have a functioning nervous system. 
They have 10 fingers, 10 toes. 
This is not a tissue we are talking 
about. This is what a child looks like 
in the womb at 20 to 22 weeks. That is 
a child. The question is, Is your line 
when that child has a beating heart, 
has a functioning nervous system, can 
experience pain? Is that your line? 
We had that vote today. Unfortu-
nately, this Senate body said no. The 
line is not at conception, and the line 
is not even when they look like this 
and can experience pain. That bill was 
voted down. 
There are only four countries in the 
world that allow abortion on demand 
at any time—four countries left in the 
world that still abort children who 
look like this, who experience pain, 
who are in late term. It is the United 
States, North Korea, China, and Viet-
nam. That is all that is left in the 
world that looks at this and says that 
is just tissue; that is not really a baby. 
This Senate voted again today to af-
firm that same club that we are in with 
China, North Korea, and Vietnam. That 
is not a club I want our Nation to be in. 
They are some of the worst human 
rights violators in the world, and they 
don’t recognize the value and the dig-
nity of life. We do, or at least I thought 
we did, but that is not where our line 
is, apparently. 
Today we took another vote in the 
Senate, and it was a very clear line as 
well to say: OK. If your line is not at 
conception, and if it is not when the 
child can experience pain, and it is not 
a late-term abortion when the child is 
actually viable, maybe your line is ac-
tually when they are delivered, when 
they are fully out of the womb. We 
took a vote on a bill called the Born- 
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection 
Act. It is a very straightforward bill. It 
is not about abortion at all. It is about 
a child who is fully delivered. 
In medical practice, there are times 
when there is a late-term abortion that 
in the procedure itself to actually con-
duct the abortion, instead of the child 
being aborted and killed in the womb, 
it is a spontaneous birth that actually 
occurs, and the child is actually fully 
delivered. The intent was to destroy 
the child in the womb, but that is not 
what happened. What happened, in-
stead, in a small percentage of abor-
tions, was that child was actually de-
livered. Now the question is, the child 
is no longer in the womb. The child is 
literally fully delivered and is crying 
on the table in front of you. What do 
you do? We asked the question of this 
body: Where is your line? Is your line 
at delivery? Even if the intent was 
originally abortion, that didn’t occur, 
is your line at delivery? Unfortunately, 
this body voted no. We could not get 60 
Senators of 100 to say even if a child is 
fully delivered outside of the womb,

February 25, 2020 
crying on the table, that is a child. 
That is a frightening statement about 
where we are in our culture. 
I have had all kinds of folks say: 
Well, this is not about infanticide. In-
fanticide is already illegal. 
I said: Yes, that is true. 
In 2002, there was unanimous support 
in this body, in the Senate, to pass a 
bill saying that if a child is delivered, 
that would be infanticide. The problem 
was, it left no consequences at all and 
allowed what still happens today where 
if a child is fully delivered, there are 
no consequences for allowing them to 
die on the table. 
A 
couple 
of 
years 
ago, 
Kermit 
Gosnell was fully delivering children in 
his abortion clinic. He was fully deliv-
ering them, and then he would take 
scissors, flip the child over, and snip 
their spinal cord to kill them. He is in 
prison right now for carrying out that 
act because that was considered infan-
ticide. But what is still legal is allow-
ing the child to just lie there on the 
table until they slowly die. 
Jill Stanek is a nurse who has prac-
ticed for years in Illinois. She gave tes-
timony in a hearing not long ago and 
testified multiple times about what is 
going on in some of these abortion fa-
cilities and what happens when a child 
is fully delivered and they are still 
alive. In her experience, what she has 
watched before, she has noticed that 
children will live outside the womb. 
These are viable children lying on the 
table, or in her particular hospital, 
they literally took the child to a linen 
closet and closed the door and left him 
there. They would live somewhere be-
tween an hour and, some children, as 
long as 8 hours, just waiting to die. La-
dies and gentlemen, in ancient times, 
it was called exposure when you would 
take a child and set them outside to 
die without medical care. 
Our vote today was, if a child is fully 
delivered, should they get medical 
care, or should we just allow medical 
facilities to just back off and allow 
them to slowly die? And today this 
Senate could not get 60 votes to say we 
should at least give medical care to 
that child instead of allowing them to 
slowly die on the table on their own— 
a child literally crying, kicking their 
feet, but ignored. I would hope we are 
better than that as a country, but ap-
parently the line has still not been dis-
covered for the value of a child. I am 
one who believes that a child has great 
value, a child has great worth. Whether 
that child is a kindergartner or in the 
womb, that child has value. As a cul-
ture, we should stand for the value of 
every child. 
I am amazed, absolutely amazed 
when I think about the fact that 100 
years ago, my wife, my mom, and my 
daughters would not have been able to 
vote. I can’t even process that 100 years 
ago, my wife, my mom, and my daugh-
ters would not have been allowed to 
vote in America. What were we think-
ing as Americans that we did that? 
I am amazed that there was a time in 
America not that long ago where if you 
were of Japanese descent, they rounded 
you up, put you in camps, and held 
you, as an American citizen, just be-
cause you were of Japanese descent. I 
can’t even process the fact that we did 
that as Americans. 
I cannot believe there was a time in 
America where we looked at African 
Americans and said: That is three- 
fifths of a man. I cannot even process 
that was in our law, that we declared a 
human being three-fifths of a person. 
I am so grateful that we no longer 
round up people because they are of 
Japanese descent, that we allow women 
to vote, and that we consider all people 
equal. I am so grateful that time has 
passed. I long for the day, which I be-
lieve is coming, that we as a nation 
look back and say: What were we 
thinking that we allowed children to 
live or die based on our convenience? 
And if a child was inconvenient, we 
just killed them or we set them on the 
table and allowed them to slowly die 
from exposure because they were in-
convenient in the moment. There will 
be a day when we will look back on 
this season in American history and we 
will say: What were we thinking that 
we considered some children more val-
uable than others, that we considered 
some lives worth living and some to 
just be thrown away? 
What is your line? When is a life 
worth protecting? When does life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness actu-
ally apply to you in America? I wish it 
was conception or at least when they 
can experience pain or at least when 
they are fully born, but this body has 
not yet found the moment when we can 
agree that life is valuable. I long for 
the day that we do. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to once again call 
upon the Senate to take immediate and 
urgent action to prevent Russia or any 
other foreign power from interfering in 
our 2020 elections. Since the last time I 
came to the Senate floor to talk about 
this issue, it has become only more ur-
gent. The clock is ticking, and each 
day that goes by without the Senate 
taking action, this body becomes more 
complicit in the hijacking of our de-
mocracy by Vladimir Putin or other 
foreign powers that try to interfere in 
our elections. 
Just in the last week, we have seen 
significant 
new 
developments. 
We 
know that the intelligence community 
briefed the House Intelligence Com-
mittee about ongoing Russian inter-
ference in our current elections. 
We also know that upon learning 
about that briefing, upon hearing that 
the intelligence community was doing 
its job in keeping Congress informed 
about election interference, President 
Trump erupted upon hearing the news. 
He did not want the House of Rep-
resentatives to know what the Rus-
sians were up to. 
We know that soon after that brief-
ing, President Trump unceremoniously 
fired his Acting Director of National 
Security, Joseph Maguire, who is a 
military veteran and a career public 
servant of great integrity. All of that, 
we know. And we know that President 
Trump replaced Mr. Maguire with an 
Acting Director who has no prior expe-
rience in the intelligence community 
and whose only qualification appears 
to be to tell President Trump what 
President Trump wants to hear when it 
comes to intelligence information or 
other matters. 
None of us should be surprised to 
learn that the Russians are interfering 
again in our elections. They did it in 
2016. That was the unanimous verdict 
of all our U.S. intelligence agencies. In 
fact, that was the verdict by the head 
of agencies who had been appointed by 
President Trump. That was also the bi-
partisan finding of the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee. They found that 
there was some level of Russian inter-
ference in the 2016 elections in every 
State in the country, all 50 States. It 
was also the well-documented conclu-
sion in the Muller report that brought 
a number of indictments against Rus-
sian operatives of the GRU. 
Just last November, the leaders of 
the intelligence agencies—again, lead-
ers appointed by the current Presi-
dent—all warned the Congress and the 
American people that the Russians and 
other foreign powers would seek to 
interfere in our elections in 2020. Those 
agencies included the heads of the 
NSA, the CRA, the FBI, the DNI, and 
others. Last November, all of them 
warned us about expected Russian in-
terference in our elections. So it really 
should be no surprise that we learned 
last week of a briefing in the House 
where 
the 
intelligence 
community 
said: We told you so. 
We have determined that the Rus-
sians are interfering right now in the 
ongoing 2020 elections. That shouldn’t 
be surprising. What is surprising and 
what is shocking is that the Congress 
has done virtually nothing to prevent 
it. Think about that. We were warned 
in 2016. We have been warned repeat-
edly since then that the Russians are 
going to interfere in our 2020 elections. 
We now have a briefing about ongoing 
interference and still nothing. What 
does the President do in response to 
that information? He fires the head of 
the intelligence community. He fires 
him because he doesn’t want him to 
tell Congress what the Russians are 
doing. 
Just last month, in February, the 
Senate Intelligence Committee issued 
another report. It was another bipar-
tisan report. What they did was they 
went back to look at what happened in

February 25, 2020 
the 2016 elections—specifically in the 
lead-up 
to 
the 
2016 
elections—and 
asked themselves the question: Why, 
when we learned that there was some 
Russian interference, did we not notify 
and alert the country? 
Their findings were interesting. They 
found that there were various political 
reasons. People had concerns about 
making that information public. In 
fact, the Republican leader, the major-
ity leader here, was one of those who 
said: No, we should not inform the 
American people about that inter-
ference. 
The Senate Intelligence Committee 
drew lessons from that, saying: We 
shouldn’t be caught once again unpre-
pared. That is what they said in the re-
port just last month, and now we are 
sitting here today with the intelligence 
community telling us the Russians are 
interfering right now as we speak, and 
we are doing nothing about it. Our de-
mocracy is under attack, and we are 
just pretending things are going on as 
normal. You would think we would all 
agree that when our democracy is 
under attack, we should unify imme-
diately and take every action nec-
essary to prevent that. 
What could and should we do? 
We should harden our election sys-
tems. We should make sure that voting 
systems around the country are harder 
to hack. We should make sure that 
voter registration information is hard-
er to hack, and we have dedicated some 
additional 
resources 
to 
that. 
We 
haven’t done enough, but we have 
taken some small steps in that direc-
tion, as we should. 
This is a situation in which the best 
defense is a good offense, and as long as 
Vladimir Putin and the Russians don’t 
pay any price at all for interfering in 
our elections, it should be no surprise 
that they are going to keep on doing it. 
It is cost-free to them. In fact, they are 
gaining major benefits, and we see 
them around the country. They are 
succeeding in helping to divide Ameri-
cans against one another. They are 
succeeding in undermining public con-
fidence in the democratic system. That 
is exactly what Vladimir Putin wants 
to do here in the United States and 
among our allies in Europe and else-
where around the world. 
What should we do about it? 
After we learned of what happened in 
2016, Senator RUBIO and I introduced a 
bipartisan bill. It is called the DETER 
Act. In addition to Senator RUBIO and 
me, we have Republican and Demo-
cratic cosponsors. 
What does the bill do? 
It is pretty straightforward. It says 
to Vladimir Putin and other foreign 
powers: If we catch you interfering in a 
future election, you will pay a price. 
That price will be immediate, and it 
will be severe. So, if you are thinking 
about what benefits you might gain 
from interfering in an American elec-
tion, you will know there will also be a 
big price to pay. 
That is the legislation that Senator 
RUBIO and I introduced back in 2017. It 
has not gotten a vote here in the U.S. 
Senate. It has not gotten it. It didn’t 
have a vote in the last Congress, so we 
reintroduced it in this Congress. 
Now, last fall, when we were taking 
up the National Defense Authorization 
Act, the NDAA, the Senate agreed that 
part of our national defense meant de-
fending our democracy and part of our 
defending our democracy meant de-
fending the integrity of our elections. 
So we unanimously, by a voice vote 
here in the Senate, said that the De-
fense authorization bill should include 
a provision like the DETER Act, that 
it should include a provision that says 
to the Russians and other foreign pow-
ers: If we catch you interfering in an 
election, there will be a severe price to 
pay. 
When I talk about a severe price, I 
mean sanctions on their economies, 
sanctions on their major banks, sanc-
tions on the energy sectors—real eco-
nomic pain, not imposing sanctions on 
a few oligarchs, but real pain. That is 
what the Senate said we should do as 
part of the NDAA, the National De-
fense Authorization Act. 
Guess what happened? 
When the conferees—when the nego-
tiators—went behind closed doors, the 
White House essentially told the Sen-
ate conferees: Huh-uh, we don’t want 
you adopting these important protec-
tions—protections to defend the integ-
rity of our democracy. 
So, despite that unanimous Senate 
vote, it just disappeared in the middle 
of the night from the negotiations over 
the Defense authorization bill. 
What do we do? 
The clock is ticking, and it is time 
for the Senate to do now what it said it 
wanted to do when we unanimously 
passed that motion to instruct the con-
ferees to pass something like the 
DETER Act as part of the Defense bill, 
and we are, right now, engaged in ongo-
ing discussions with the chairman of 
the Senate Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs Committee to try to fi-
nally get this bill—this bipartisan 
bill—out of the U.S. Senate. I hope we 
make progress because what appears to 
be the situation is that the White 
House is essentially putting up a mas-
sive roadblock to progress on this mat-
ter. 
It is not our job in the U.S. Senate to 
simply do the bidding of this President 
or of any other President. It is the duty 
of this Senate to protect our democ-
racy against what we know is an ongo-
ing attack on the integrity of our elec-
tions. 
That is why I am here on the floor 
right now, because we just got the news 
last week that everything we had been 
warned about in terms of expected Rus-
sian interference in our 2020 elections 
is coming true. So we have a missile 
aimed at the integrity of our elections, 
and the Senate is doing nothing about 
it. It is unbelievable and grossly neg-
ligent to know, in realtime, that our 
elections are being undermined and to 
take no action. 
I just want to say to my colleagues 
that, if we don’t move forward on the 
bipartisan DETER Act in the coming 
days and make progress in the coming 
days, I will be back here on the Senate 
floor next week, and I will ask for 
unanimous consent to bring it up. If 
Senators want to come down here in 
the light of day and say no—no to bi-
partisan legislation that protects our 
democracy—they can do that, but we 
are going to keep at this, and with 
every day that goes by, we learn more 
about what is happening now. 
I close with what I said before: We 
should not be surprised that Vladimir 
Putin is interfering in our elections. He 
did it in 2016, and we have been told 
ever since then that he will do it again. 
What is surprising and shocking and 
grossly negligent is that this body has 
not taken action to date to protect our 
democratic process. We are going to 
keep fighting until we get that done. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Would the Sen-
ator accept a question? 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Yes, I would be 
delighted to entertain a question. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, just for the reference of everyone, 
I believe the majority leader is going 
to come in for his closing script. When 
he does, that will end whatever little 
colloquy we will have had here, and I 
will then do my ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ 
speech. 
In the time that it takes the major-
ity leader to get here, I am interested 
in hearing the Senator from Maryland 
say that the White House—our White 
House—the President of the United 
States—is a massive roadblock to pro-
tecting the integrity of our upcoming 
election from foreign interference. How 
does that make sense? Why would it be 
an American President who doesn’t 
want to defend the integrity of an 
American election from foreign inter-
ference? 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank the Sen-
ator from Rhode Island for the ques-
tion. 
All I can say is we have seen a pat-
tern from this President. We saw this 
President, President Trump, in Hel-
sinki a few years ago, standing next to 
Vladimir Putin, and our President was 
the one who threw our intelligence 
community under the bus. He said he 
trusted Vladimir Putin when Putin 
told 
him, 
Don’t 
worry, 
President 
Trump. We didn’t interfere in your 
elections. 
President Trump said: OK. I think 
President Putin may be right about 
our intelligence community. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. He did say it 
very strongly. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. He did, and we 
have seen that pattern over and over 
again. 
We just learned of this briefing that 
took place in the House of Representa-
tives this week. The response from 
President Trump was not, Oh, my 
goodness. Let’s pass this legislation. It 
was to fire the guy who was in charge 
of the intelligence community.

S1141 
February 25, 2020 
So what do you think? 
It is a mystery to all of us as to why 
the President is taking this action 
other than the fact that, of course, he 
did call on Russia in the last election 
and welcomed its support. We all saw 
him on national television when he did 
that. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes. 
In fact, even the Mueller report 
showed that there was considerable 
Russian activity and support in the 
election that made Donald Trump our 
President. They couldn’t prove an on-
going conspiracy between the Trump 
campaign and the Russian election in-
terference effort, but they confirmed 
that there was a Russian election in-
terference effort. If I recall correctly, 
they confirmed that the Trump cam-
paign was witting of it, just not con-
spiring with it, just not directly en-
gaged with it. 
So I don’t know. Perhaps it is just 
the hope that, perhaps, he will get 
elected again with foreign interference 
and that he doesn’t want to close off 
that option, but it is a little bit odd for 
the President of the United States not 
to take the protecting of the security 
of the American election more seri-
ously. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I am glad Senator 
WHITEHOUSE
made 
that 
distinction 
with respect to the Mueller report. 
It is true that they did not find a 
criminal conspiracy, meaning they did 
not find some agreement between the 
Trump campaign and the Russians to 
interfere, but they found plenty of evi-
dence of the Trump campaign’s wel-
coming the intervention from the Rus-
sians. 
Of course, we have more recently 
seen President Trump spreading the 
conspiracy theories that were launched 
by Vladimir Putin that it was not the 
Russians who interfered in the 2016 
elections: Oh, my God. It was the 
Ukrainians who interfered in the 2016 
elections. 
There is this famous videotape now 
of Vladimir Putin’s saying: Thank God, 
they are not blaming the Russians any-
more. They are blaming the Ukrain-
ians. 
Translation: Thank God our propa-
ganda is working, and even the Presi-
dent of the United States and some 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives are parroting our conspiracy the-
ory, the ones that we cooked up. 
It is really alarming that a foreign 
government—someone 
like 
Vladimir 
Putin—is so successful in spreading its 
misinformation within our system. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I appreciate the 
concern of the Senator from Maryland 
on this, and I wish him success with his 
legislation. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank the Sen-
ator for his questions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I come to again raise an alarm 
about the massive carbon pollution 
that we are dumping into our natural 
world and to tell the stories of two 
ocean creatures that are suffering from 
that pollution. Now, we may mock or 
ignore these creatures—these lesser 
creatures so far down the food chain 
from us—but we are fools to ignore the 
message of what is happening to them. 
Matthew 25:41 admonishes, ‘‘as you 
did it to one of the least of these . . . 
you did it to me.’’ So we ought not 
mock and ignore these lesser species 
because they also have a lesson for us, 
a warning. If we keep up what we are 
doing to them, it will soon enough be 
we who suffer. As Pope Francis warned: 
Slap Mother Nature, and she will slap 
you back. 
Let’s start, before we get to the two 
species, with an overview. 
First, it is not just these two species. 
Science writer Elizabeth Kolbert has 
warned that we have entered a sixth 
great extinction—the first and only 
great extinction in humans’ time on 
the planet—and that this great extinc-
tion is driven by manmade pollution 
and climate change. Scientists from 
around the globe have just issued one 
of the most comprehensive reports ever 
on Earth’s biodiversity, and the head of 
that panel, Sir Robert Watson, summa-
rized its findings this way. 
I quote him here: 
The overwhelming evidence . . . presents 
an ominous picture. The health of eco-
systems on which we and all other species 
depend is deteriorating more rapidly than 
ever. We are eroding the very foundations of 
our economies, livelihoods, food security, 
health and quality of life worldwide. 
The legendary David Attenborough 
warns that we face what he calls ‘‘irre-
versible damage to the natural world 
and the collapse of our societies.’’ 
He says: ‘‘It may sound frightening, 
but the scientific evidence is that if we 
have not taken dramatic action within 
the next decade, we could face irrevers-
ible damage to the natural world and 
the collapse of our societies.’’ 
In all of this, we need to remember 
our oceans. Oceans are warming and 
acidifying 
and 
literally 
suffocating 
ocean species as oxygen dead zones ex-
pand. Earth’s oceans warm at the rate 
of 
multiple 
Hiroshima 
explosions’ 
worth of heat per second—per second. 
They acidify at the fastest rate in at 
least 50 million years. They are also 
fouled with our plastic garbage and 
polluted by runoff from farming and 
stormwater. Our oceans’ warnings are 
loud and clear and measurable. They 
are chronicled by fishermen and sailors 
and measured with thermometers, tide 
gauges, and simple pH tests that meas-
ure acidification. 
It is this acidification that takes me 
to these two species. The oceans are 
absorbing around 30 percent of our ex-
cess carbon dioxide emissions, and they 
do that in a chemical interaction that 
takes up the CO2 but acidifies the sea-
water. Don’t pretend there is any dis-
pute about this. Acidification is a 
chemical phenomenon. You can dem-
onstrate it in a middle school science 
lab. You can demonstrate it with your 
breath, an aquarium bubbler, a glass of 
water, and a pH strip. In fact, I have 
done so right at this desk. 
Here is the first species pictured—the 
tiny pteropod. It is an oceanic snail 
about the size of a small pea. It is 
known as the sea butterfly because it 
has adapted two butterflylike wings 
that can propel it around in the ocean. 
Acidifying waters make it harder for 
pteropods and a lot of other shelled 
creatures to grow their shells and de-
velop from juveniles to adults. Re-
searchers in the Pacific Northwest 
have reported what they called ‘‘severe 
shell damage’’ on more than half of the 
pteropods they collected from Central 
California to the Canadian border. 
These images show the pteropod’s 
shell when the creature’s underwater 
environment becomes more acidic—not 
good for pteropods. Maintaining their 
shells against that acidity requires en-
ergy—energy that would otherwise go 
into growth or reproduction. So acidifi-
cation makes it harder for species, 
such as the pteropods and other shell 
creatures at the base of the oceanic 
food chain, to survive. 
Who cares? Who cares about the 
lowly, humble pteropod? Who cares 
about some stupid ocean snail? Well, 
for one, salmon do. Half the diet of 
some salmon species in the Pacific is 
pteropods. Salmon fisheries support 
coastal jobs and economies across our 
Pacific Northwest. Offshore fishing in 
the United States is a multibillion dol-
lar industry connected to hundreds of 
thousands of livelihoods. If you care 
about 
our 
fisheries 
industry, 
you 
should care about the humble pteropod. 
An entire food chain stands on its tiny 
back, and we are in that food chain. 
Move up the food chain a little, and 
you find another creature facing peril 
from 
acidification—the 
Dungeness 
crab. You see this crustacean on ice in 
your local fish market. It is an impor-
tant commercial catch along our west 
coast. In 2014, the last year the Pacific 
States Marine Fisheries Commission 
did a comprehensive report, the Dunge-
ness catch was worth $170 million. It is 
Oregon’s most valuable fishery, and it 
is important also for Washington State 
and for California, where annual land-
ings run between $40 and $95 million. 
Up north, in 2017, Alaska’s commercial 
landings of Dungeness crabs totaled 
more than 2.1 million pounds. 
Last month, marine scientists re-
ported that acidified oceans are dis-
solving the delicate shells of Dungeness 
crab larvae. The acidic environment is 
not just damaging the shells but also 
damaging 
the 
larvae’s 
mechanore-
ceptors, the hairlike sensory organs 
that crabs use to hear and feel and 
make their way around the sea. The 
damage to the crabs is bad news, but 
worse is that we are seeing it now. Sci-
entists thought hardy Dungeness crabs 
wouldn’t be affected by acidification 
for decades. Richard Feely, senior 
NOAA scientist and coauthor of the 
study, reports that these ‘‘dissolution

impacts to the crab larvae . . . were 
not expected to occur until much later 
in this century.’’ 
The sentinel implications for the en-
tire ecosystem are grave. If the Dunge-
ness are feeling the effects of ocean 
acidification now, what other creatures 
are feeling those effects too? Another 
lead author of this study said: ‘‘If the 
crabs are affected already, we really 
need to make sure we start to pay 
much more attention to various com-
ponents of the food chain before it is 
too late.’’ 
These concerns about the Dungeness 
crab and its happening too soon echo 
what scientists actually said of early 
findings about the pteropod. Oceanog-
rapher William Peterson, who is the co-
author of an early study on the pter-
opod, said: ‘‘We did not expect to see 
pteropods being affected to this extent 
in our coastal region for several dec-
ades.’’ 
So we are way ahead of schedule in 
terms of what scientists have predicted 
for ocean acidification outcomes for 
these foundational creatures in our 
ocean ecosystem. Together, the pter-
opod and the Dungeness crab send a 
common message, one echoed by a 
Rhode Island fishing boat captain who 
told me: ‘‘Sheldon, things are getting 
weird out there.’’ 
And they are getting weird faster 
than expected. The rapid ocean acidifi-
cation that we are measuring now and 
that we are causing now with further 
carbon pollution is nearly unprece-
dented in the geological record. Sci-
entists look back to try to find histor-
ical analogs for what is happening. The 
closest historical analogs scientists 
can find for what they are seeing now 
in the oceans go back before human-
kind. There is no analog in human 
time. You have to go back before hu-
mans existed, back into the prehistoric 
record, back to the prehistoric great 
extinctions, back when marine species 
were wiped out and ocean ecosystems 
took millions of years to recover. That 
is the historical analog that best 
matches our current direction. 
In his encyclical ‘‘Laudato Si,’’ Pope 
Francis, who is a trained scientist him-
self, reflected on what he called ‘‘the 
mysterious network of relations be-
tween things’’ in life. In that mys-
terious network of relations between 
things, the pteropod and the crab larva 
give their lives to transmit food energy 
from the microscopic plants they eat, 
which would be of no use to us, up to 
the fish that consume the pteropod and 
larva—fish, which we, in turn, con-
sume—all in that great mysterious net-
work of relations between things. 
What is happening to these two spe-
cies is more than just an event. It is a 
signal. It is a signal of a looming global 
ecological catastrophe. Lesser species, 
species that we may mock or ignore, 
can sometimes be sentinels for hu-
mans, like the legendary canaries 
taken down into coal mines. When the 
sentinels start to die, it is wise to pay 
attention. 
What happens when, in our arrogance 
and pride, we refuse to heed the warn-
ings from creatures so humble as the 
pteropods or crab larvae? Well, remem-
ber why Jesus was so angry with the 
Pharisees. What was their sin? Their 
arrogance and their pride blinded them 
to the truth. The Senate, this sup-
posedly greatest deliberative body, has 
blinded itself to the devastation fossil 
fuels are unleashing on our Earth’s 
mysterious network. We careen reck-
lessly into the next great extinction. 
Pope Francis says: 
Because of us, thousands of species will no 
longer give glory to God by their very exist-
ence, nor convey their message to us. We 
have no such right. 
Indeed, we have no such right. 
So I come here today to challenge us 
to see the damage we have done—the 
damage we are doing now, today, to 
this mysterious network of life, this 
mysterious God-given network of life 
that supports us. I challenge us also to 
turn away from dark forces of corrup-
tion and greed—specifically, the fossil 
fuel industry forces that have delib-
erately, on purpose, crippled our abil-
ity in Congress to stop their pollution. 
I close by challenging us to heed the 
message of the humble creatures shar-
ing this planet with us—the least of us, 
who share God’s creation. They suffer 
at our hands, and in their suffering 
they send us a message, a warning, 
that we would do well to hear.

LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
when one looks at a largely unified and 
democratic Europe, today it is easy to 
forget just how different it was in East-
ern Europe not that long ago. For half 
a century, millions lived under the tyr-
anny and repression of the Soviet 
Union. 
But in the late 1980s, things began to 
change, particularly in the Baltic na-
tions of Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-
uania. Who can forget when 2 million 
people joined hands across these three 
nations to form the 420-mile Baltic 
Chain of Freedom in August 1989? And 
not long after in February of the fol-
lowing year, Lithuania held its first 
free elections since World War II, vot-
ing for the country’s first postwar non- 
Communist government. Immediately 
thereafter, the new Parliament voted 
to make Lithuania the first occupied 
Soviet republic to declare independ-
ence. Lithuania’s bold move was fol-
lowed later that year by Latvia and Es-
tonia. These brave efforts culminated a 
year later in February 1991, when the 
Lithuania 
people 
overwhelmingly 
voted 
for 
independence—a 
historic 
move recognized by the US and Soviet 
Union that same year. 
My first visit to Lithuania was near-
ly 40 years ago, but my ties reach back 
even further. One hundred years ago, 
my grandmother left her village of 
Jubarkas with her three small children 
to join my grandfather in America. In 
her arms, she carried a 2-year-old tod-
dler—my mother, Ona Kutkaite. 
Hidden in my grandmother’s baggage 
was a small Catholic prayer book, 
printed in Vilnius in 1863, the last year 
before printing in Lithuanian was out-
lawed by the czars. That prayer book— 
the last, cherished relic of my family’s 
life in their beautiful and ancient 
home—escaped the czars and was kept 
safe with our family in America during 
the brutal Soviet occupation. When I 
had the honor of addressing the Seimas 
of the Republic of Lithuania on the 
20th anniversary of independence, I was 
proud to bring that prayer book home 
to a free Lithuania. Those brave Lith-
uanians 30 years ago—including my 
friend 
Vytautus 
Landsbergis, 
who 
served as Lithuanian’s first post-inde-
pendence head of state—led the coun-
try to a prosperous and democratic fu-
ture. 
Lithuania today is a vital member of 
the European Union, NATO, and the 
community of democracies. It held the 
presidency of the European Union ear-
lier this decade and is a leading voice 
on the continent for standing up to 
Russia, defending Ukraine, and uphold-
ing key democratic values. And as it 
faces renewed threats from Russia, I 
have 
been 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
strengthening NATO operations and 
defenses in the Baltic nations. A few 
years ago, I visited the Lithuanian 
town of Rukla, where U.S. and German 
forces were rotating through as part of 
the European Reassurance Initiative 
aimed at keeping the Baltic safe. 
As the cochair of the Senate Baltic 
Caucus, I will be introducing a resolu-
tion in the weeks ahead reaffirming 
this security cooperation and recog-
nizing Lithuania’s great achievements 
around its 30th anniversary of inde-
pendence. 
In February 1990, when I came to 
Lithuania as part of an American dele-
gation to observe the historic elec-
tions, my friends took me inside the 
Seimas to show me the arsenal of the 
Lithuanian freedom fighters. In the 
corner stood a handful of old rifles—no

match for the Soviet war machine. But 
Lithuanians were armed with stronger 
weapons—faith, courage, and a burning 
desire to reclaim their independence. 
Because of the sacrifices of so many pa-
triots, known and unknown, we can 
proudly and without fear proclaim here 
today on the 30th anniversary of these 
historic events: Laisva Lietuva. Free 
Lithuania. Now and always. 
So let us use this historic anniver-
sary to recommit to our continued sup-
port for our Baltic allies through eco-
nomic and security cooperation and to 
reaffirm America’s commitment to 
NATO and the enduring transatlantic 
alliance. Doing so will help ensure the 
next 30 years of the longstanding U.S.- 
Baltic friendship are equally strong 
and fruitful.

150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ERIE 
HOUSE 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
Florence Hayden Towne dedicated her 
book, ‘‘Neighbor: Stories of Neighbor-
hood House Work in a Great City,’’ to 
the Erie Neighborhood House. She 
wrote, it ‘‘brought new hope and cour-
age and a new way of life these whom 
we call ‘neighbors.’ ’’ Throughout its 
150-year history, the Erie House has 
consistently improved the lives of low- 
income, immigrant families in Chi-
cago. Though the people, challenges, 
and times may have changed, the Erie 
House’s mission has remained firm. Im-
migrant families have always found 
Erie House to be a place that empowers 
them and helps creates a more engaged 
community. Today, we celebrate the 
great work of Erie House and congratu-
late its staff and supporters on the 
150th anniversary. 
Erie Neighborhood House began as 
Holland Presbyterian Church on the 
corner of North Noble Street and West 
Erie Street in 1870. The congregation 
offered several programs, including 
kindergarten and Sunday school, to the 
new families arriving from Dutch, 
Scandinavian, and German countries to 
the West Chicago neighborhood. The 
congregation moved to 1347 West Erie 
Street and changed its name to Erie 
Chapel in 1886. In 1893, Erie Kinder-
garten became one of the 20 flagship 
programs in Chicago’s Free Kinder-
garten Association initiative and ex-
panded youth programs to include 
choirs for children and adults and in-
dustrial classes. 
As the neighborhood immigrant pop-
ulation changed to include Catholic 
countries like Poland and Italy, Erie 
Chapel renamed itself the Erie Chapel 
Institute and continued to serve the 
community and advance the settle-
ment house tradition. In 1936, the staff 
rechristened the 1347 building with a 
new name, the Erie Neighborhood 
House. 
Erie Neighborhood House continued 
to meet the challenges of the time. In 
1942, with the Second World War rag-
ing, 
Erie 
House 
began 
providing 
daycare services since many men were 
deployed overseas and many women 
had entered the workforce. In February 
1945, 
Reverend 
Douglas 
Cedarleaf 
marched with members of Erie House 
to 
protest 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
Strongs, a Black family that had re-
cently moved into a White community 
and faced violence from their neigh-
bors. 
In 
1957, 
volunteer 
physicians 
at 
Northwestern 
Memorial 
and 
Erie 
Neighborhood House founded the Erie 
Family Health Center to provide a va-
riety of primary care, case manage-
ment, and dental services to low-in-
come, 
underinsured, 
and 
uninsured 
Chicagoans. Now, every year, nearly 
38,000 
patients 
receive 
high-quality 
healthcare at the center, regardless of 
their ability to pay. 
With the crisis in housing growing in 
the late 1960s, Erie House founded the 
Bickerdike Redevelopment Corporation 
to create affordable housing opportuni-
ties for members of the community. 
Since its founding, Bickerdike has de-
veloped more than 2,000 affordable 
homes for families. 
Today, the West Town and Little Vil-
lage 
neighborhoods 
are 
primarily 
Latino, and Erie Neighborhood House 
is helping people with the tools they 
need to build a foundation for greater 
well-being. Erie House has hosted me 
several times and has been an impor-
tant ally in working toward com-
prehensive immigration reform and 
supporting Dreamers, providing legal 
consultation and representing people in 
immigration and asylum cases. 
The blueprint created 150 years ago 
has evolved, but that mission has re-
mained constant. Today, Erie House 
helps 18,000 people all across the city of 
Chicago annually. Young people and 
adults attend mentoring programs and 
learn about career opportunities. Fam-
ilies experiencing violence can find 
counseling. Erie House remains an es-
sential ally as we work toward a just, 
inclusive society where we accept our 
new neighbors and help them achieve 
their potential. 
Congratulations to Erie Neighbor-
hood House on 150 years of good work, 
giving people hope and courage. 
(At the request of Mr. SCHUMER, the 
following statement was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD.)

ABORTION 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
today I would like to speak in opposi-
tion to two dangerous pieces of legisla-
tion that were considered in the Sen-
ate, both of which would severely un-
dermine women’s constitutional right 
to safe and legal abortions. One bill, S. 
3275, the so-called Pain-Capable Unborn 
Protection Act, would create a na-
tional 20-week abortion ban, while the 
other, S. 311, the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act, would at-
tempt to scare providers who perform 
abortions out of business by subjecting 
them to penalties or even prison. 
Let me be clear. These bills are not 
about protecting babies. These bills are 
about telling women what they can and 
cannot do with their own bodies and 
making their own medical decisions for 
them. Today in the United States, we 
have some of the highest maternal 
mortality rates and infant mortality 
rates in the developed world. This cri-
sis is only worsened by the racial and 
economic disparities many women face 
in our country, in addition to the re-
ality that some 87 million Americans 
are either uninsured or underinsured. 
Instead of helping our Nation make 
progress toward eliminating these dis-
parities, such as by guaranteeing af-
fordable healthcare, including abor-
tion, as a right, this legislation would 
bring us back to the dark ages when 
women in America did not have the 
right to control their own bodies. It is 
a simple reality that, if the Senate 
votes to deny women access to safe and 
legal abortion, many of them will suf-
fer and perhaps even die. I urge my col-
leagues to oppose S. 3275 and S. 311. 
Thank you.∑

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, in 
1619, Africans were first brought to Vir-
ginia, 
against 
their 
will, 
to 
be 
enslaved. From that moment on, White 
Americans 
systematically 
and 
vio-
lently denied the rights of citizenship 
to Black Americans. The adoption of 
the 15th Amendment, ratified in Feb-
ruary 1870, was a historic effort to cor-
rect course. It recognized the right of 
all male citizens, including Black men, 
to vote. This amendment was the first 
time that we promised to protect the 
right of African Americans to full and 
equal participation in our democracy. 
In the 150 years since then, we have 
tried to expand on that promise many 
times, like when women of all races 
and ethnicities finally won the right to 
vote in 1920. Yet our promise remains 
elusively unfulfilled. Today, in honor 
of Black History Month, I would like to 
take a moment to discuss the trajec-
tory of that broken promise, as well as 
its impact on our character as a na-
tion. 
We began to break our promise short-
ly after we made it. During the Recon-
struction and Jim Crow eras, White 
men and women across the country de-
veloped a number of techniques—some 
obvious and brutal, some subtle and 
pernicious—to keep African Americans 
away from the polls and out of govern-
ment. 
The broader goal of these tactics was 
to hamper the Black population’s abil-
ity to recover from slavery by blocking 
their access to education and the eco-
nomic means of building wealth. 
I believe that it is important to ac-
knowledge that Maryland partook in 
these pernicious behaviors right along-
side other States. Maryland residents 
and government officials engaged in 
ballot tampering, imposed literacy and 
property restrictions, stoked racist 
fears to galvanize the White vote, and 
intimidated Black voters using out-
right violence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1144 
February 25, 2020 
My intention here is not to condemn 
my home State. To the contrary, I am 
exceedingly proud of the struggles for 
justice that have bloomed in Maryland 
through abolitionists like Harriet Tub-
man and Frederick Douglas and civil 
rights leaders like Thurgood Marshall. 
I draw inspiration from the lineage of 
African-American public servants in 
Maryland who overcame enormous ob-
stacles in order to amplify the voices of 
their brothers and sisters. 
These public servants include Verda 
Welcome, the first Black woman ever 
elected to any State’s senate, as well 
as Adrienne Jones, the current speaker 
of the Maryland House of Delegates, 
who is the first African American and 
first woman to serve in that position. 
They also include my friend and 
hero, Congressman Elijah Cummings, 
the son of sharecroppers who devoted 
his life to fighting for equality and 
fairness and lifting up our beloved com-
munity of Baltimore. 
I am likewise grateful for all of the 
Marylanders whose names we might 
not know, but who nevertheless work 
every day to expand educational eq-
uity, reform our justice system, shrink 
the wealth gap, deliver healthcare, and 
otherwise make our society better. 
Thanks to brave and dedicated people 
like these in Maryland and across the 
country, we have made significant 
strides toward racial justice. 
I began my remarks by discussing 
Maryland’s bleaker moments in history 
for two reasons. First, to demonstrate 
that we must never take progress for 
granted—Maryland 
has 
not 
always 
been a tolerant, inclusive State, it did 
not become one by accident, and it will 
not continue to be one unless we work 
to make it so. Democracy and the rule 
of law do not just happen; we need to 
protect and nourish them every day. 
Second, to illuminate how those in-
justices that still exist, of which there 
are many, are not new and are not inci-
dental—they are not just disparate ef-
fects of forces beyond our control. 
They are deeply rooted in policies and 
systems intentionally designed to sub-
jugate African Americans. 
One of the strongest, most disheart-
ening examples of this phenomenon is 
the ongoing assault on the right to 
vote. This is not ancient history. 
States all over the country continue to 
‘‘modernize’’ strategies developed a 
century ago to suppress African-Amer-
ican voting power. Some of these strat-
egies are blatant and recognizable, like 
mass purges of voter rolls; the gerry-
mandering of districts with ‘‘surgical 
precision,’’ according to one court; and 
intimidation of Black voters. Some of 
the strategies are disguised behind ex-
cuses or fear tactics, like obstructive 
voter ID laws and felony disenfran-
chisement. 
Regardless, these tools of oppression 
are alive and operating as intended. 
One in every 13 African Americans 
has lost his or her right to vote be-
cause of felony disenfranchisement. 
Seventy percent of the voters purged 
from one State’s roll in 2018 were Afri-
can Americans. Studies reveal that im-
plementing strict voter ID laws widens 
the Black-White turnout gap by more 
than 400 percent. 
So long as we allow these sorts of 
practices to continue under the exag-
geration of voter ‘‘fraud,’’ we are deny-
ing African Americans their full right 
to vote and breaking the promise we 
made 150 years ago. This is a problem 
on principle, of course, but also for 
practical reasons; when we exclude peo-
ple from fully participating in our de-
mocracy, 
we 
prevent 
them 
from 
achieving the social, economic, and 
civic reforms they need to strengthen 
their families and communities. 
So what are we going to do about 
that? I know what I will do; I will fight 
for laws that will guarantee every 
American a voice in our democracy. 
That is why I have introduced bills to 
restore the Federal right to vote to ex- 
offenders and to penalize the voter in-
timidation and deception efforts so fre-
quently aimed at people of color. These 
measures alone will not eliminate sup-
pression of the Black vote, but they are 
steps in the right direction. 
The racism that we vowed to root out 
a long time ago is still here. We may 
have reined it in, or it may have taken 
new forms that we do not recognize 
yet, but it is still here. 
The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. remarked, ‘‘It may be true 
that the law cannot make a man love 
me, but it can keep him from lynching 
me.’’ It is true that we cannot legislate 
love, but we can and must legislate 
equality. 
Until we guarantee the right to vote 
regardless of race, we fall short of the 
unique promise and potential of the 
United States of America. How can we 
be, at last, the Shining City on the 
Hill, while we continue to deny people 
their right to vote because of the color 
of their skin? 
For the sake of our democracy and 
our common humanity, for the sake of 
those who have suffered and died, for 
the sake of those living and those yet 
to come, let us make good on our 150- 
year-old promise. 
Let us build on the progress we have 
achieved, and let us stay vigilant about 
the threats that remain. Let us fulfill 
the right to vote. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
the country is deeply divided on mul-
tiple issues right now. The impeach-
ment trial is both a symptom of our 
times and another example of our divi-
sion. At the beginning of our Nation, 
we did not have an impeachment in-
quiry of a President for almost 100 
years with the partisan impeachment 
of Andrew Johnson. After more than 
100 years, another impeachment in-
quiry was conducted when the House 
began a formal impeachment inquiry 
into President Nixon in an overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan vote of 410–4. Within a 
period of weeks, President Nixon re-
signed before he was formally im-
peached. Then, just over two decades 
later, President Clinton was impeached 
by the House, on another mostly par-
tisan vote leading to a partisan acquit-
tal in the Senate. 
This season of our history has been 
referred to as the Age of Investigations 
and the Age of Impeachment. We have 
had multiple special counsels since 1974 
over multiple topics. This is more than 
just oversight; it has been a unique 
time in American history when the pol-
itics of the moment have driven rapid 
calls for investigation and impeach-
ment. Over the past 3 years, the House 
of Representatives has voted four times 
to open an impeachment inquiry: once 
in 2017, once in 2018, and twice in 2019. 
Only the second vote in 2019 actually 
passed and began a formal inquiry. 
The Mueller investigation that con-
sumed most of 2018 and 2019 answered 
many questions about Russian attacks 
on our voting systems—although no 
votes were changed—but it was also a 
$32 million investigation that took 
more than 2 years of America’s atten-
tion. For the last 4 months the country 
has been consumed with impeachment 
hearings and investigations. The first 
rumors of issues with Ukraine arose 
August 28 when POLITICO published a 
story about U.S. foreign aid being slow- 
walked for Ukraine, and then on Sep-
tember 18 when the Washington Post 
published a story about a whistle-
blower report that claimed President 
Trump pressured an unnamed foreign 
head of state to do an investigation for 
his campaign. 
Within days of the Washington Post 
story on September 24, Speaker PELOSI 
announced that the House would begin 
hearings to impeach the President, 
which led to the formal House vote to 
open the impeachment inquiry on Oc-
tober 31 and then a vote to impeach the 
President on December 18. But after 
the partisan vote to impeach the Presi-
dent, Speaker PELOSI held the Articles 
of Impeachment for a month before 
turning them over to the Senate, which 
began the formal trial of the President 
of the United States on January 16, 
2020. After hearing hours of arguments 
from both House managers and the 
President’s legal defense team and Sen-
ators asking 180 questions to both 
sides, the trial concluded February 5, 
2020. 
There are key dates to know: 
April 21, 2019, President Zelensky is 
elected President of Ukraine. 
May 21, President Zelensky sworn in. 
After 
the 
ceremony, 
President 
Zelensky abolishes Parliament and 
calls for quick snap elections on July 
21. 
July 21, Ukrainian Parliamentary 
elections. President Zelensky’s party 
wins a huge majority. 
July 25, President Trump calls Presi-
dent Zelensky to congratulate him and 
his party.

blower working in the U.S. intelligence

community filed a complaint that he 
had heard from others that the Presi-
dent of the United States had tried to 
pressure President Zelensky of Ukraine 
to investigate former Vice President 
Joe Biden on an official phone call July 
25, 2019. 
August 26, the Inspector General for 
the Intelligence Community declares 
the whistleblower report ‘‘an urgent 
matter’’ and asks for its release within 
7 days. The Justice Department looks 
over the report and notes that al-
though it was written by a person in 
the intelligence community, it is not 
related to intelligence matters, so it 
does not fall within the Inspector Gen-
eral’s jurisdiction and it is forwarded 
on to the Department of Justice for re-
view. 
August 28, POLITICO publishes a 
story that the annual military aid for 
Ukraine 
is 
currently 
being 
slow- 
walked. 
September 9, the Inspector General 
contacts the House Intelligence Com-
mittee to let them know that he has 
not been able to release the whistle-
blower report to their committee. 
September 13, the House Intelligence 
Committee 
subpoenas 
the 
whistle-
blower report. 
September 18, the Washington Post 
prints a story with ‘‘unnamed sources’’ 
that there is a whistleblower report 
about the President talking with a for-
eign leader about a campaign matter. 
September 24, the House began an in-
formal 
impeachment 
inquiry 
after 
Speaker Pelosi announced it at a press 
conference in the U.S. Capitol. 
September 25, President Trump re-
leased the official unredacted ‘‘read 
out’’ of the phone call with President 
Zelensky from July 25. 
September 26, the whistleblower re-
port is declassified and released pub-
licly. 
October 31, the House formally votes 
along party lines for an impeachment 
inquiry. 
December 18, the House votes to im-
peach the President with two articles— 
abuse of Power and obstruction of con-
gress 
January 15, Speaker PELOSI releases 
the Articles of Impeachment to the 
Senate. 
January 16, Senate trial on impeach-
ment begins. 
February 5, Senate trial concludes 
with acquittal on both articles. 
Ukraine became independent in 1991 
when it broke away from the Soviet 
Union, but the Ukrainians have faced 
constant pressure from Russia ever 
since. In 2014 Ukraine forced out its 
pro-Russia President, and Moscow re-
taliated by taking over Crimea—and 
stealing 
the 
Ukrainian 
Navy—then 
rolling tanks into eastern Ukraine and 
taking all of eastern Ukraine by force. 
Russian and Ukrainian troops continue 
to fight every day in eastern Ukraine. 
The people of Ukraine face an aggres-
sive Russia on the east and pervasive 
Soviet era corruption throughout the 
government and the business commu-
nity. President Trump met the pre-
vious President of Ukraine in 2017 to 
talk about other countries helping 
Ukraine with greater military support 
funds and to ask how Ukraine could ad-
dress corruption on a wider scale. The 
two Presidents also spoke about lethal 
aid—allowing the Ukrainians to buy 
sniper rifles, anti-tank Javelin mis-
siles, and other lethal supplies—to help 
them fight the invading Russians. The 
United States also started sending a 
couple hundred American troops to 
train Ukrainian soldiers in the far west 
of Ukraine. 
On April 21, 2019, President Zelensky 
was overwhelmingly elected as the new 
President of Ukraine. He was a sitcom 
actor/comedian who had no political 
experience but was well known for his 
television show in which he played the 
part of a corruption-fighting teacher 
who 
was 
elected 
as 
President 
of 
Ukraine. 
His 
television 
popularity 
helped him win the election, but when 
he was sworn in on May 21, he was rel-
atively unknown to most of the world. 
On the same day as his inauguration, 
May 21, President Zelensky abolished 
Parliament and called for snap elec-
tions to put his party in power. With a 
new President in place and parliamen-
tary elections in Ukraine coming, 
starting in June of 2019, the President 
ordered foreign aid to Ukraine to be 
held until the end of the fiscal year, 
but agencies were informed that they 
should do all the preliminary work 
needed before the aid was sent, so it 
would be ready to release at a mo-
ment’s 
notice. 
The 
leadership 
in 
Ukraine was not notified that there 
was a hold on their foreign aid. 
The new Parliament was elected on 
July 21, and President Zelensky’s party 
won by a landslide. By mid-August, the 
new Parliament was working on anti- 
corruption efforts and trying to estab-
lish a high court on corruption, which 
they put in place September 5, 2019. 
There was a tremendous amount of un-
certainty in the early days of the new 
administration, 
but 
by 
mid-August 
there was clear evidence of actual 
change in a country that desperately 
needed a new direction from its corrupt 
past. 
On July 25, when President Trump 
called President Zelensky, the Presi-
dent congratulated President Zelensky 
for the big win in Parliament and 
talked about ‘‘burden-sharing’’—other 
nations also paying their share of sup-
port for Ukraine. The two Presidents 
talked about their disapproval of the 
previous mbassadors to each other’s 
countries. But instead of following all 
the staff preparation notes written by 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, the Na-
tional Security Council staffer as-
signed to Ukraine, and just talking 
about ‘‘corruption’’ in general, the 
President brought up a question about 
Ukraine and the 2016 election inter-
ference, which I will note below. Presi-
dent Zelensky also brought up to Presi-
dent Trump that his staff was planning 
to meet with Rudy Giuliani, President 
Trump’s personal attorney, in the com-
ing days, which led to a conversation 
about Joe Biden and the firing of the 
previous prosecutor in Ukraine. 
After the call, Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman contacted an attorney at the 
National Security Council to express 
his ‘‘policy concerns’’ about the call. It 
is interesting to note that Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman’s boss, Tim Morrison, 
was also on the call, but he did not see 
any problems or concerns with the call 
according to his own testimony in the 
House impeachment inquiry. Within a 
month, a whistleblower filed a report 
about the call, saying he heard about 
the call secondhand and was concerned 
about the implications of a conversa-
tion about elections on a head-of-state 
call. To keep the July 25th call in con-
text with other news, the day before it 
took place July 24 Robert Mueller had 
testified before Congress as the last of-
ficial act to close down the 21⁄2 year 
Mueller investigation and clear the 
President and his campaign team of 
any further accusation of election in-
terference. 
During the impeachment trial in the 
Senate, the House managers repeated 
over and over that the President was 
planning to cheat ‘‘again’’ on the next 
election, but the final conclusion of the 
Mueller report was that ‘‘ultimately, 
the investigation did not establish that 
the (Trump) Campaign coordinated or 
conspired with the Russian government 
in its election-interference activities.’’ 
This is especially notable because for 
years a rumor circulated that Ukraine 
was part of the 2016 election inter-
ference and that someone in Ukraine 
was hiding the Democratic National 
Committee, 
DNC, 
server 
that 
was 
hacked by the Russians in 2016. As the 
conspiracy theory goes, it was actually 
the Ukrainians who hacked the DNC, 
not 
the 
Russians. 
This 
is 
the 
‘‘Crowdstrike’’ theory that President 
Trump asked President Zelensky to 
help solve during the call. 
Agencies of the U.S. intelligence 
community have stated over and over 
that they did not believe that Ukraine 
was involved in the Russian election 
interference from 2016. I personally 
agree with the intelligence community 
assessment but Rudy Giuliani and mul-
tiple others around President Trump 
believed there was a secret plan in 2016 
to hurt President Trump’s election 
from Ukraine. This accusation was am-
plified by bits of truth, including that 
the 
Ukrainian 
Ambassador 
to 
the 
United States wrote an editorial in 
support of Hillary Clinton in 2016 right 
before the election, and several other 
Ukrainian officials publicly spoke out 
against Candidate Trump in 2016. 
There is nothing illegal about a for-
eign nation speaking out for or against 
a Presidential candidate, whether Hil-
lary Clinton or Donald Trump in 2016 
or anyone else in the future. It may 
not be wise to take sides before an elec-
tion, but it is not illegal. Just because 
some Ukrainian officials took sides

February 25, 2020 
does not mean that the whole Ukrain-
ian Government worked on a cyber at-
tack on our elections. But since this 
rumor had persisted, and it was a new 
administration now in Ukraine, Presi-
dent Trump asked President Zelensky 
to help clear up the facts if he could. 
That is certainly not illegal or im-
proper, and it is certainly not some-
thing that could help the President in 
the 2020 election, especially since the 
2016 Russian election accusation had 
just been closed the day before. 
The 2016 ‘‘Crowdstrike’’ theory is the 
issue that President Trump asked 
President Zelensky to ‘‘do us a favor’’ 
about, not the Bidens or Burisma. Dur-
ing the July 25 call after the question 
about 
‘‘Crowdstrike,’’ 
President 
Zelensky 
mentioned 
to 
President 
Trump that one of his advisers would 
be meeting with Rudy Giuliani soon. 
Then, President Trump affirmed that 
meeting and encouraged them to talk 
about the Biden investigation and the 
firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor. 
That may seem out of the blue, but 
in Washington, D.C., that week, the 
city was buzzing about a Washington 
Post article that had been written 3 
days before July 22, 2019—detailing 
Hunter Biden’s giant salary—$83,000 per 
month—for doing essentially nothing 
for a corrupt Ukrainian natural gas 
company and how it undercut Vice 
President Biden’s message on corrup-
tion. 
It is important to get the context of 
that week to understand the context of 
the phone call that day. I have no 
doubt that the story was just as big of 
news in Kiev, Ukraine, as it was in 
Washington, D.C., that week. President 
Trump’s 
personal 
attorney, 
Rudy 
Giuliani, had been in and out of 
Ukraine since November 2018, meeting 
with government officials and trying to 
find out more about the ‘‘Crowdstrike’’ 
theory or any other Ukrainian connec-
tion to the 2016 election. During that 
time, Rudy Giuliani met several former 
prosecutors from Ukraine who blamed 
their departure on Vice President 
Biden. It is clear that Rudy Giuliani 
was working to gain information about 
both of these issues in his capacity as 
President Trump’s private attorney. 
It is not criminal for Rudy Giuliani 
to work on opposition research for a 
Presidential campaign or to work on 
behalf of his client to clear his name 
from any issues related to the 2016 
campaign, which he had done since No-
vember 2018. Some have stated that 
since this was ‘‘foreign information,’’ 
it is illegal. That is absolutely not 
true. In fact, Hillary Clinton and the 
Democratic National Committee in 
2016 paid a British citizen, Christopher 
Steele, to work his contacts in Russia 
to create the now debunked ‘‘Steele 
Dossier,’’ which the FBI used to open 
its investigation into President Trump, 
leading directly to the appointment of 
Special Counsel Mueller. That dossier 
was opposition research done in Russia 
by a British citizen, paid for by the 
Clinton campaign team. Their opposi-
tion research was not illegal, but the 
use and abuse of that document by the 
FBI to start an investigation was cer-
tainly inappropriate and is most likely 
illegal. But the FBI warrant issue is 
still being investigated by the ongoing 
Durham probe. 
During the July 25, 2019, call, Presi-
dent Zelensky brought up the issue of 
Rudy Giuliani, and President Trump 
replied to his statement. You can argue 
that President Trump should not have 
discussed the issue with President 
Zelensky when he brought it up, but it 
is certainly not illegal or impeachable 
to talk about it, especially when there 
are serious questions about Hunter 
Biden’s work with Burisma. That is not 
a conservative conspiracy theory; the 
issue of Hunter Biden’s employment in 
Ukraine was a problem for years at the 
State Department. It had been raised 
to Vice President Biden when he was 
still in office. Every State Department 
official interviewed for the Trump im-
peachment investigation noted that at 
best it was a clear conflict of interest, 
and it was the center of a huge story on 
corruption in the Washington Post on 
July 22, 2019. It had the appearance of 
high-level corruption by using a well- 
placed family member on the board of 
a known corrupt gas company in 
Ukraine to shelter it from prosecutors. 
Hunter Biden had only resigned from 
the Burisma board a few months before 
the July 25 phone call, just prior to 
when his dad announced his run for the 
Presidency in 2019. 
After the July 25 phone call, Attor-
ney General Barr did not have any fol-
lowup meetings or calls with Ukrainian 
officials. Rudy Giuliani did have addi-
tional conversations with Ukrainian 
officials, which are legal to do since he 
is a private attorney representing the 
President. 
TEXT OF JULY 25, 2019 PHONE CALL BETWEEN 
PRESIDENTS TRUMP AND ZELENSKY 
The President: Congratulations on a great 
victory. We all watched from the United 
States and you did a terrific job. The way 
you came from behind, somebody who wasn’t 
given much of a chance, and you ended up 
winning easily. It’s a fantastic achievement. 
Congratulations. 
President Zelensky: You are absolutely 
right Mr. President. We did win big and we 
worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I 
would like to confess to you that I had an op-
portunity to learn from you. We used quite a 
few of your skills and knowledge and were 
able to use it as an example for our elections 
and yes it is true that these were unique 
elections. We were in a unique situation that 
we were able to achieve a unique success. I’m 
able to tell you the following; the first time 
you called me to congratulate me when I 
won my presidential election, and the second 
time you are now calling me when my party 
won the parliamentary election. I think I 
should run more often so you can call me 
more often and we can talk over the phone 
more often. 
The President: (laughter) That’s a very 
good idea. I think your country is very 
happy about that. 
President Zelensky: Well yes, to tell you 
the truth, we are trying to work hard be-
cause we wanted to drain the swamp here in 
our country. We brought in many many new 
people. Not the old politicians, not the typ-
ical politicians, because we want to have a 
new format and a new type of government. 
You are a great teacher for us and in that. 
The President: Well it is very nice of you 
to say that. I will say that we do a lot for 
Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of 
time. Much more than the European coun-
tries are doing and they should be helping 
you more than they are. Germany does al-
most nothing for you. All they do is talk and 
I think it’s something that you should really 
ask them about. When I was speaking to An-
gela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she 
doesn’t do anything. A lot of the European 
countries are the same way so I think it’s 
something you want to look at but the 
United States has been very very good to 
Ukraine. I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal 
necessarily because things are happening 
that are not good but the United States has 
been very very good to Ukraine. 
President Zelensky: Yes you are absolutely 
right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and 
I can tell you the following; I did talk to An-
gela Merkel and I did meet with her I also 
met and talked with Macron and I told them 
that they are not doing quite as much as 
they need to be doing on the issues with the 
sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanc-
tions. They are not working as much as they 
should work for Ukraine. It turns out that 
even though logically, the European Union 
should be our biggest partner but technically 
the United States is a much bigger partner 
than the European Union and I’m very grate-
ful to you for that because the United States 
is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more 
than the European Union especially when we 
are talking about sanctions against the Rus-
sian Federation. I would also like to thank 
you for your great support in the area of de-
fense. We are ready to continue to cooperate 
for the next steps specifically we are almost. 
ready to buy more Javelins from the United 
States for defense purposes. 
The President: I would like you to do us a 
favor though because our country has been 
through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about 
it. I would like you to find out what hap-
pened 
with 
this 
whole 
situation 
with 
Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. I guess you 
have one of your wealthy people . . . The 
server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a 
lot of things that went on, the whole situa-
tion. I think you’re surrounding yourself 
with some of the same people. I would like to 
have the Attorney General call you or your 
people and I would like you to get to the bot-
tom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole 
nonsense ended with a very poor perform-
ance by a man named Robert Mueller, an in-
competent performance, but they say a lot of 
it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can 
do, it’s very important that you do it if 
that’s possible. 
President Zelensky: Yes it is very impor-
tant for me and everything that you just 
mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it 
is very important and we are open for any fu-
ture cooperation. We are ready to open a new 
page on cooperation in relations between the 
United States and Ukraine. For that pur-
pose, I just recalled our ambassador from 
United States and he will be replaced by a 
very competent and very experienced ambas-
sador who will work hard on making sure 
that our two nations are getting closer. I 
would also like and hope to see him having 
your trust and your confidence and have per-
sonal relations with you so we can cooperate 
even more so. I will personally tell you that 
one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani 
just recently and we are hoping very much 
that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to 
Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to 
Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once 
again that you have nobody but friends

around us. I will make sure that I surround 
myself with the best and most experienced 
people. I also wanted to tell you that we are 
friends. We are great friends and you Mr. 
President have friends in our country so we 
can continue our strategic partnership. I 
also plan to surround myself with great peo-
ple and in addition to that investigation, I 
guarantee as the President of Ukraine that 
all the investigations will be done openly 
and candidly. That I can assure you. 
The President: Good because I heard you 
had a prosecutor who was very good and he 
was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot 
of people are talking about that, the way 
they shut your very good prosecutor down 
and you had some very bad people involved. 
Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He 
was the mayor of New York City, a great 
mayor, and I would like him to call you. I 
will ask him to call you along with the At-
torney General. Rudy very much knows 
what’s happening and he is a very capable 
guy. If you could speak to him that would be 
great. The former ambassador from the 
United States, the woman, was bad news and 
the people she was dealing with in the 
Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let 
you know that. The other thing, There’s a 
lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden 
stopped the prosecution and a lot of people 
want to find out about that so whatever you 
can do with the Attorney General would be 
great. Biden went around bragging that he 
stopped the prosecution so if you can look 
into it . . . It sounds horrible to me. 
President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you 
about the prosecutor. First of all, I under-
stand and I’m knowledgeable about the situ-
ation. Since we have won the absolute ma-
jority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor 
general will be 100% my person, my can-
didate, who will be approved, by the par-
liament and will start as a new prosecutor in 
September. He or she will look into the situ-
ation, specifically to the company that you 
mentioned in this issue. The issue of the in-
vestigation of the case is actually the issue 
of making sure to restore the honesty so we 
will take care of that and will work on the 
investigation of the case. On top of that, I 
would kindly ask you if you have any addi-
tional information that you can provide to 
us, it would be very helpful for the investiga-
tion to make sure that we administer justice 
in our country with regard to the Ambas-
sador to the United States from Ukraine as 
far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It 
was great that you were the first one who 
told me that she was a bad ambassador be-
cause I agree with you 100%. Her attitude to-
wards me was far from the best as she ad-
mired the previous President and she was on 
his side. She would not accept me as a new 
President well enough. 
The President: Well, she’s going to go 
through some things. I will have Mr. 
Giuliani give you a call and I am also going 
to have Attorney General Barr call and we 
will get to the bottom of it. I’m sure you will 
figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was 
treated very badly and he was a very fair 
prosecutor so good luck with everything. 
Your economy is going to get better and bet-
ter I predict. You have a lot of assets. It’s a 
great country. I have many Ukrainian 
friends, they’re incredible people. 
President Zelensky: I would like to tell 
you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian 
friends that live in the United States. Actu-
ally last time I traveled to the United 
States, I stayed in New York near Central 
Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will 
talk to them and I hope to see them again in 
the future. I also wanted to thank you for 
your invitation to visit the United States, 
specifically Washington DC. On the other 
hand, I also want to ensure you that we will 
be very serious about the case and will work 
on the investigation. As to the economy, 
there is much potential for our two countries 
and one of the issues that is very important 
for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe 
we can be very successful and cooperating on 
energy independence with United States. We 
are already working on cooperation. We are 
buying American oil but I am very hopeful 
for a future meeting. We will have more time 
and more opportunities to discuss these op-
portunities and get to know each other bet-
ter. I would like to thank you very much for 
your support. 
The President: Good. Well, thank you very 
much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy 
and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank 
you. Whenever you would like to come to the 
White House, feel free to call. Give us a date 
and we’ll work that out. I look forward to 
seeing you. President Zelensky: Thank you 
very much. I would be very happy to come 
and would be happy to meet with you person-
ally and get to know you better. I am look-
ing forward to our meeting and I also would 
like to invite you to visit Ukraine and come 
to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. 
We have a beautiful country which would 
welcome you. On the other hand, I believe 
that on September 1 we will be in Poland and 
we can meet in Poland hopefully. After that, 
it might be a very good idea for you to travel 
to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and 
go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, 
which is probably much better than mine. 
The President: Okay, we can work that 
out. I look forward to seeing you in Wash-
ington and maybe in Poland because I think 
we are going to be there at that time. Presi-
dent Zelensky: Thank you very much Mr. 
President. 
The President: Congratulations on a fan-
tastic job you’ve done. The whole world was 
watching. I’m not sure it was so much of an 
upset but congratulations. 
President Zelensky: Thank you Mr. Presi-
dent bye-bye. 
Based on a whistleblower report 
about the July 25 call, the House Intel-
ligence Committee subpoenaed the re-
port on September 13 and started its 
impeachment inquiry on September 24. 
In the Senate impeachment trial, 
House managers stated their belief 
that the President had carried out a 
‘‘scheme to cheat in the 2020 election’’ 
by 
withholding 
financial 
aid 
to 
Ukraine 
and 
withholding 
a 
White 
House meeting with the new President 
of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine an-
nouncing it would investigate Joe 
Biden, Burisma, and 2016 election inter-
ference. 
Let’s discuss the facts of both. 
WHITE HOUSE MEETING 
There is no question that President 
Trump had offered a White House 
meeting to President Zelensky three 
times: once in May on a phone call 
after President Zelensky won his elec-
tion, once in June in a letter, and fi-
nally in the July 25 call after President 
Zelensky’s party won the parliamen-
tary elections. But Tim Morrison— 
State Department official called as a 
witness by the House—also testified 
that they were working on heads-of- 
state meetings with 12 other heads of 
state during that same time period. 
Many nations were trying to line up 
meetings in the White House during 
the summer of 2019. 
During the July 25 call, President 
Zelensky offered to instead move their 
meeting from a White House meeting 
to a face-to-face meeting in Warsaw, 
Poland, when they would both be there 
on September 1, 2019. The Presidents 
agreed, and planning began on the 
meeting in August. By August 22, the 
meeting planning was in full swing, as 
noted by emails in the House hearing’s 
evidence. However, Hurricane Dorian 
slammed into the United States in the 
hours leading up to the September 1 
meeting, causing a last-minute shift to 
the Vice President traveling to Poland 
so the President could stay in the 
United States to monitor hurricane re-
lief. 
We know that Vice President PENCE 
met 
face-to-face 
with 
President 
Zelensky, and they spoke about other 
nations paying their fair share to help 
Ukraine and the issue of corruption 
across Ukraine. We know from the 
preparation materials and the meeting 
notes themselves that during the meet-
ing the Vice President did not bring up 
or discuss the issue of Burisma, Joe 
Biden, or any other campaign con-
versation with President Zelensky. 
The White House found the next 
available time when President Trump 
and President Zelensky would both be 
in the same place at the same time to 
set up a face-to-face meeting: Sep-
tember 25 at the U.N. Assembly in New 
York. That meeting was set up, and it 
took place as scheduled. 
In the Senate impeachment trial, the 
House managers maintained that only 
a White House meeting was sufficient 
and that it was being withheld, but the 
facts show that President Zelensky 
himself floated the idea of a meeting in 
Poland and that the meeting was not 
barred or withheld. 
In the early months of President 
Zelensky’s term, there was a great deal 
of concern about him, his staff, and his 
plans because he was an unknown po-
litical figure. Until more was known 
about him, it was entirely appropriate 
to show caution in coordinating a 
meeting, but once his nationwide anti- 
corruption efforts began in August, it 
was clear that face-to-face meetings 
were planned and carried out. 
There was no withholding of a face- 
to-face meeting with President Trump 
and President Zelensky. There cannot 
be a quid pro quo if the meeting was 
not withheld from Ukrainian officials. 
The House managers claimed that 
there was a secret plot to ‘‘extort’’ or 
‘‘bribe’’ the leadership of Ukraine to 
investigate Hunter Biden in exchange 
for around $400 million of U.S. aid. The 
aid was State Department and foreign 
military aid that had been provided for 
the past 4 years, since Ukraine had 
been in a war with Russia. 
After 
the 
Russian 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine in 2014 and its occupation of 
Crimea and the Donbas region in east-
ern Ukraine, the United States started 
sending aid to help the Ukrainian Gov-
ernment. Congress allowed lethal and 
non-lethal aid to support Ukraine, but 
during the previous administration, 
only non-lethal aid was sent. Under

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1148 
February 25, 2020 
President Trump’s administration, it 
was determined that the United States 
would give the leadership of Ukraine 
lethal aid to help them fight off Rus-
sian 
tanks, 
which 
was 
President 
Zelensky’s reference to ‘‘javelins’’ in 
the July 25 phone call and his gratitude 
to President Trump for allowing those 
tank 
killing 
rockets 
to 
flow 
to 
Ukraine. 
To be clear, the theory of funds being 
withheld from Ukraine in exchange for 
an investigation does not originate 
from the July 25 call read-out. There is 
nothing in the text of the call that 
threatens the withholding of funds in 
exchange for an investigation. 
The theory originates from the fact 
that aid was held back by the Office of 
Management and Budget, headed by 
the President’s Acting Chief of Staff, 
Mick Mulvaney, and the ‘‘presump-
tion’’ of U.S. Ambassador to the Euro-
pean Union, Gordon Sondland, that the 
aid must have been held because of the 
President’s desire to get the Biden in-
vestigation done, since the President’s 
attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was working 
to find out more about the Biden inves-
tigation. 
Ambassador Sondland told multiple 
people about his theory, but when he 
finally called President Trump and 
asked him directly about it, the Presi-
dent responded that he did not have 
any quid pro quo; he just wanted the 
President of Ukraine to do what he ran 
on and ‘‘do the right thing.’’ Obviously, 
people who assume the worst about 
President Trump take this as a secret 
message that there actually was a quid 
pro quo, but the most important fact is 
that Ambassador Sondland did not read 
it that way after his call with the 
President. Ambassador Sondland be-
lieved that the President was serious. 
Unfortunately, the White House Coun-
sel was never allowed to cross examine 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
during 
the 
House investigation to get the facts 
about who he talked to and why he 
came to believe for a while that there 
was an effort to push for investigations 
in exchange for money. 
During the Senate trial, I listened 
closely to the facts surrounding the 
withholding of aid money to Ukraine. 
This was by far the most serious 
charge against the President. Two key 
questions had to be answered for me: 
Why was the aid held, and why was the 
aid released? There was no question the 
aid was held for a of couple months. 
The question was why? 
Statements from the House witnesses 
during the House impeachment inquiry 
answered the two key questions: The 
aid was held because there was a legiti-
mate concern about the new President 
of Ukraine and his administration in 
the early days of his Presidency and 
the aid was released on time when the 
new Ukrainian Parliament starting 
passing anti-corruption laws in August 
and after Vice President PENCE
sat 
down face to face with President 
Zelensky on September 1 in Poland to 
discuss their progress on corruption. 
We should not lose track of what was 
happening in Ukraine in 2019. A new 
President was elected who was a TV 
actor with no political experience and 
no record on how he would handle Rus-
sia or the issue of widespread national 
corruption in Ukraine. He ran on a 
platform of anti-corruption at all lev-
els, but no one knew how he would gov-
ern. His campaign was funded by a 
Ukrainian oligarch who owned a major 
media outlet, and one of his first advis-
ers was the former attorney for that 
oligarch. 
I personally spoke to many of the 
State Department officials in Ukraine 
in May of 2019 and heard their concerns 
about 
the 
new 
government. 
Then, 
newly elected President Zelensky used 
his power to dissolve their Parliament 
the day he was sworn in and called for 
‘‘snap elections’’ in which the vast ma-
jority of the newly elected leaders were 
from his newly formed party. To our 
State 
Department 
and 
the 
White 
House, this was either a really a good 
sign or a really bad sign. Either 
Ukraine was about to take a major 
change for the better with new leader-
ship, or this new young leader was 
about 
to 
assume 
real 
centralized 
power. No one knew for certain in May, 
June, and July of 2019. Within a few 
weeks in August, the new Parliament 
got to work passing anti-corruption 
laws and making significant changes in 
their accountability and for the coun-
try. This was a very good sign. 
When Vice President PENCE met face 
to face with President Zelensky Sep-
tember 1, both sides had confidence the 
country was taking a new direction. On 
September 10 Vice President PENCE and 
Senator ROB PORTMAN met with Presi-
dent Trump to tell him about the 
progress that had been made, and both 
advised lifting the hold on aid. The aid 
was lifted the next day, September 11. 
No investigation into Hunter Biden or 
Burisma was ever done by Ukraine, and 
no part of the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice was ever involved in any investiga-
tion of Hunter Biden or Burisma. 
Although the aid was frozen in June, 
there was no public announcement of 
the hold, as explained by the White 
House Counsel, to keep this from be-
coming a public issue while the White 
House monitored the progress and sta-
tus of the transition in Ukraine. 
On August 27, POLITICO published 
an article that noted that the foreign 
aid had been held by the United States. 
This caused President Zelensky’s office 
to reach out to the State Department 
and ask why. During the House im-
peachment proceedings, four of the 
House witnesses—Ambassador Voelker, 
Ambassador 
Sondland, 
Ambassador 
Taylor, and Tim Morrison—all testified 
that the Ukrainian leadership learned 
about the temporary hold in aid after 
the POLITICO article was published. 
The issue of the hold was also the 
first question from President Zelensky 
to Vice President PENCE
when they 
met on September 1 in Poland. The 
idea that the leadership in Ukraine had 
pressure placed on them to do an inves-
tigation fails the most essential test. 
Did the leadership of Ukraine even 
know that the aid was being held? The 
answer from multiple American and 
Ukrainian leaders was no, they did not 
know there was a hold on the aid from 
the White House. You cannot have 
pressure to act on an investigation if 
they did not even know the aid was 
being held. 
It is interesting to note, when I re-
searched the records of past foreign aid 
payment dates and times to Ukraine, I 
found the 2019 aid was in line with the 
date the 2016, 2017, and 2018 aid was 
sent. The vast majority of the military 
aid to Ukraine was obligated in August 
or September for the past 4 years. Al-
though the aid was ready to go out the 
door a couple months earlier in 2019, it 
was certainly not late, based on the 
record of the previous 3 years. In fact, 
the State Department aid was obli-
gated September 30 in 2019, but it was 
obligated September 28 in 2018. As 
quoted by the Ukrainian Minister of 
Defense, ‘‘The aid was held such a 
short time, we did not even notice.’’ 
During the 2 days of question-and-an-
swer time, I asked a specific question 
related to this issue because I felt it 
was important to get the context of the 
aid, since there had been so much made 
of the issue during the trial. Here is 
the full text of my question to the 
White House Counsel: 
House Managers have described any delay 
in military aid and state department funds 
to Ukraine in 2019 as a cause to believe there 
was a secret scheme or quid pro quo by the 
President. In 2019, 86% of the DOD funds were 
obligated to Ukraine in September, but in 
2018, 67% of the funds were obligated in Sep-
tember and in 2017, 73% of the funds were ob-
ligated in September. In the State Depart-
ment, the funds were obligated September 30 
in 2019, but they were obligated September 28 
in 2018. Each year, the vast majority of the 
funds were obligated in the final month or 
days of the fiscal year. Question: Was there 
a national security risk to Ukraine or the 
United States from the funds going out late 
in September in the two previous years? Did 
it weaken our relationship with Ukraine be-
cause the vast majority of our aid was re-
leased in September each of the last three 
years? 
In response to my question, White 
House Counsel detailed the fact that 
military aid from the United States 
was not for immediate use. It was de-
signed to help the Ukrainian military 
buy materials for the next year, so it 
was common for the aid to be obligated 
at the end of the fiscal year—Sep-
tember 30—and it was also common for 
some money to be left unobligated and 
carried over into the next fiscal year, 
as it was in 2019. 
While it is easy to create an intricate 
story on the hold placed on foreign aid 
to Ukraine, it is also clear that Presi-
dent Trump has temporarily held for-
eign aid from multiple countries over 
the past 2 years, including: Afghani-
stan, Pakistan, Honduras, Guatemala, 
El Salvador, Lebanon, and others. 
There is no question that a President 
can withhold aid for a short period of

February 25, 2020 
time, but it must be released by Sep-
tember 30, the end of the fiscal year, 
which it was in this instance. 
Article I, section 2 of the U.S. Con-
stitution grants the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives ‘‘the sole power of im-
peachment,’’ while article I, section 3 
states that ‘‘the Senate shall have the 
sole power to try all impeachments.’’ 
The Constitution is clear that the 
House does not control the Senate 
process and the Senate does not con-
trol the House process; however, during 
the impeachment trial of President 
Trump, the House tried repeatedly to 
dictate to the Senate how it should 
conduct its trial. 
The ‘‘sole power to try’’ means lay-
ing out rules for the trial, including 
when and if to call additional witnesses 
or request more documents. 
In addition to laying out roles and 
responsibilities for impeachment, our 
Constitution also provides basic rights 
for the accused. The Fifth Amendment 
ensures due process. However, the re-
ceipt of due process is not contingent 
upon waiving another right, like im-
munity or executive privilege. But that 
is exactly what the House tried to force 
President Trump to do. 
The President is not above the law, 
but neither is the House of Representa-
tives. If there was a question as to the 
scope and proper use of the President’s 
right to assert immunity or executive 
privilege regarding conversations he 
had with his closest advisers, that 
question is proper for a court to deter-
mine, not Congress, and surely not the 
House on its own accord. To put this in 
constitutional terms, the legislative 
branch cannot prevent the executive 
branch from having access to the judi-
cial branch. The House wanted to move 
quickly and prevent the President from 
ever going to court to resolve any 
issue. That has never been done for a 
good reason, the separation of powers. 
In previous legal battles with the 
President, it has taken months to re-
solve critical issues, like Bush v. Gore 
in 2000 or even in the Clinton impeach-
ment trial, when the House took 2 
months to resolve an issue with wit-
nesses in court. It does not have to 
drag on for years. 
The House also wanted the Chief Jus-
tice of the United States to ‘‘rule on’’ 
any issue quickly instead of allowing 
the President to go through the courts. 
This would have created a new judicial 
executive branch by putting all the ju-
dicial power of the nation in one per-
son, not in the judicial branch, as is 
stated in the Constitution. It would 
have also ignored the text of the Con-
stitution where it notes that the Chief 
Justice ‘‘presides’’ in the court of im-
peachment, not ‘‘decides.’’ The sole 
power of impeachment is in the Senate, 
not the Senate plus the one Justice. 
The Chief Justice keeps the trial mov-
ing along, based on the rules of the 
trial, but he or she is not a decider of 
fact; that is reserved to the Senate. 
The House managers wanted to ignore 
that part of the Constitution to move 
the trial faster for expedience. We can-
not ignore the Constitution or create 
bad precedent, no matter which party 
is being tried for impeachment. 
Further, the Sixth Amendment guar-
antees that the accused has the ability 
to both confront the witnesses against 
him and to have the assistance of coun-
sel. The majority of the impeachment 
inquiry in the House was done without 
a meaningful opportunity for the Presi-
dent to participate, and administration 
witnesses were denied the ability to 
have counsel present for depositions. 
The Constitution lays out a clear 
separation of powers but importantly 
also provides a system of checks and 
balances. For something as important 
as impeachment, it is imperative that 
the process be one that is squarely 
within the bounds of the Constitution 
and is one that the American people 
can trust. Unfortunately, the process 
undertaken by the House to impeach 
President Trump falls wildly short of 
the standards put in place by our 
Founders. 
Article II, section 4 of the Constitu-
tion states that ‘‘the President, Vice 
President and all civil officers of the 
United States, shall be removed from 
office on impeachment for, and convic-
tion of, treason, bribery, or other high 
crimes and misdemeanors.’’ 
During the trial of President Trump, 
there was a lot of conversation about 
what constitutes a ‘‘high crime’’ or 
‘‘misdemeanor.’’ Notably, the House 
did not charge the President with any 
crimes; rather, the House chose to im-
peach the President for ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ and ‘‘obstruction of Congress.’’ 
The House theoretically could have 
chosen to file Articles of Impeachment 
for crimes such as bribery, extortion, 
solicitation of interference in an elec-
tion, or violations of the Impound-
ments Clause Act. For any of these 
crimes, the House would have had to 
prove specific elements of each. Since 
they couldn’t prove any of those 
crimes, they chose to charge the Presi-
dent with abuse of power. As was noted 
in the trial, 40 Presidents have faced 
accusation of abuse of power, going 
back as far as George Washington. 
The abuse of power charge for Presi-
dent Trump was based on allegations 
that he improperly withheld aid to 
Ukraine and conditioned a meeting 
with President Zelensky at the White 
House in exchange for an investigation 
into former Vice President Biden and 
his son Hunter. Over the course of the 
last 4 months, we heard the term ‘‘quid 
pro quo’’ used over and over again, but 
the facts do not show criminal quid pro 
quo. As previously mentioned, Presi-
dent Zelensky asked to meet with 
President Trump in Poland, and that 
meeting was set up. Further, while the 
aid to Ukraine was delayed, it wasn’t 
delayed more than it had been the pre-
vious 2 years, and the aid was released 
without an investigation—or even an 
announcement 
of 
one—into 
the 
Biden’s. 
The second Article of Impeachment, 
obstruction of Congress, had an even 
weaker constitutional foundation. The 
investigation 
was 
announced 
Sep-
tember 24 did not officially begin until 
October 31. The impeachment vote in 
the House was December 18. This very 
short time table and the accusation 
that the President refused to follow the 
law, honor the courts, and that he 
acted like a ‘‘King’’ did not meet even 
the most basic constitutional stand-
ards for justice. 
For example, during the Mueller in-
vestigation, the President’s team fully 
cooperated with the investigation that 
included over 2,000 subpoenas and 500 
witnesses, including the President’s 
Chief of Staff, multiple Cabinet offi-
cials, and many lower level officials 
who were all made available. It was 
clear 
throughout 
the 
investigation 
that the President did not like or agree 
with the Mueller investigation, but he 
also fully cooperated with every sub-
poena, each witness, and every docu-
ment. In fact, they released over a mil-
lion pages of documents to the Mueller 
team. 
President Trump also made his dis-
agreement with the courts very clear 
on issues like the census, whether trav-
el restrictions can be put in place to 
ensure national security, or whether 
particular funds can be used to secure 
our southern border. But each time the 
President lost in court, his administra-
tion complied with orders from the ju-
diciary. That is how our system of gov-
ernment is supposed to work. 
When disagreements happen between 
the legislative branch and the judicial 
branch, they usually lead to resolution, 
not impeachment. The Fast and Furi-
ous investigation, which lasted more 
than 3 years in the Obama administra-
tion, led to a vote in the House to hold 
then-Attorney General Eric Holder in 
contempt, but it never led to an im-
peachment inquiry, even though there 
was a clear and consistent refusal to 
cooperate with Congress or turn over 
key documents for 3 years. 
In this case, the accusation that 
President Trump ignored subpoenas or 
refused to follow the law is not correct. 
The President’s team made it very 
clear that they would cooperate during 
the impeachment inquiry with properly 
authorized and issued subpoenas, but 
the House refused to issue subpoenas 
that were consistent with the law to 
seek resolution for documents and wit-
nesses. The House was focused on 
speed, not legal process. 
The House, in a rush to impeachment 
last fall, issued multiple subpoenas for 
documents and testimony before the 
House had given authority to the com-
mittees to issue subpoenas for an im-
peachment inquiry, which happened 
October 31. Since there was no author-
ity to issue the subpoenas, they were 
not duly authorized. The House also de-
manded testimony from the President’s 
inner circle without working through 
the legal questions, and the House de-
manded executive agency witnesses ap-
pear without allowing them to bring 
agency counsel with them. All of those

February 25, 2020 
issues created very real legal and con-
stitutional problems. Agency individ-
uals have always been allowed to have 
legal counsel with them when they are 
deposed, except this time. 
As a Member of Congress, I cannot 
demand the President turn over docu-
ments or give testimony in any fashion 
that I would prefer just because I have 
oversight responsibilities. In the same 
way, the President or other executive 
branch officials cannot demand I turn 
over my notes or provide my staff for 
testimony without going through the 
courts and gaining a legal subpoena. 
Congress has vigorously and rightfully 
protected its rights from unwarranted 
investigations from any President and 
Presidents have done the same. But in 
all cases, the law must be followed and 
the proper process must be pursued to 
get the information in a legal way. 
From the very first moments of the 
Senate 
trial, 
the 
House 
managers 
fought for additional witnesses and 
documents from the President. Their 
argument and justification for the sec-
ond Article of Impeachment centered 
on the White House’s refusal to turn 
over documents and make every wit-
ness available without going through 
the normal legal process. 
Per the resolution adopted by the 
Senate, the House record was part of 
the trial record. The Senate had the 
testimony of the witnesses the House 
chose to question as part of the overall 
information of the trial. The House al-
ready had 28,000 pages of documents 
that were part of the evidence they 
submitted to the Senate, although, the 
House managers admitted during the 
Senate impeachment trial that they 
still have not released all of the docu-
ments and witness testimony that they 
had gathered in their investigation to 
the White House Counsel or to the Sen-
ate. We do not fully know why the 
House held back some of its witness 
testimony and released others. 
The House witness testimony was 
used extensively in the Senate trial. 
These are the witnesses who testified 
live or via video in the House and Sen-
ate Impeachment: David Holmes, Polit-
ical Counselor, U.S. Embassy Ukraine, 
State Department; Dr. Fiona Hill, 
White House Advisor, National Secu-
rity Council; David Hale, Under Sec-
retary for Political Affairs, State De-
partment; Laura Cooper, Deputy As-
sistant Secretary of Defense; Gordon 
Sondland, U.S. Ambassador to the Eu-
ropean Union; Tim Morison, Former 
White House Adviser; Kurt Voelker, 
Former Special Envoy for Ukraine; 
LTC Alexander Vindman, National Se-
curity Council; Jennifer Williams, aide 
to 
the 
Vice 
President; 
Marie 
Yovanovitch, Former Ambassador to 
Ukraine; George Kent, Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary of State; Bill Taylor, 
Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. 
The House managers repeated over 
and over that additional witnesses 
would only take a week to depose, 
which is a clearly false statement. New 
witnesses took longer than a week to 
depose in the House inquiry; clearly it 
would take just as long or longer in a 
Senate trial. The remaining ‘‘wish list’’ 
of witnesses all had clear issues that 
needed to be resolved in the courts, 
which would take a couple of months 
to resolve, which is why the House 
managers did not push for their testi-
mony in the House impeachment proc-
ess. They valued speed more than legal 
process. 
House managers repeatedly stated 
that witnesses only took a week to de-
pose in the Clinton Senate impeach-
ment trial, but they know that during 
the Clinton Senate trial, all three 
called witnesses previously deposed in 
the House inquiry or in the grand jury 
investigation, and all issues of execu-
tive privilege had already been decided 
through the courts. There were no new 
witnesses in the Senate trial of Presi-
dent Clinton. Also, the Clinton White 
House had already had the opportunity 
to cross-examine witnesses or the in-
vestigators in the Clinton impeach-
ment inquiry. This time, the Trump 
White House had been denied that 
right. So, if new witnesses would be 
added for the Senate trial, the White 
House should have the right to also 
cross-examine the previous House wit-
nesses they had been denied the right 
to cross examine in the past. This 
would all take much longer than a 
week, and the House managers knew 
that. 
During 
the 
Clinton 
impeachment 
trial in the Senate, there were no addi-
tional documents requested, only pre-
viously deposed witnesses. The House 
managers did not go through the legal 
process to get documents, like the 
Mueller investigation had done, so all 
of the new document requests from the 
House managers would take at least 3 
to 5 weeks to complete, once a legal 
subpoena is delivered. It takes time to 
search all databases, review the docu-
ments for classified materials, deter-
mine any legal issues, and release them 
to the investigation. Once the docu-
ments are turned over, both legal 
teams need time to review the docu-
ments. Again, the House managers 
knew these facts, but they continued 
to repeat over and over that it would 
only take a week to get all the docu-
ments. 
The first question for the Senate 
trial was, do we have enough evidence 
and testimony to answer the questions 
the House presented in their Articles of 
Impeachment? If the answer is yes, 
then we do not need additional wit-
nesses or documents. If the answer is 
no, then we do need additional infor-
mation. There were many leaks and 
newspaper stories during the trial de-
signed to push the Senate to vote to 
ask for more testimony, but that did 
not change the primary question. We 
already knew from evidence that there 
was no quid pro quo, no Ukrainian in-
vestigations, and no withholding of a 
public meeting with President Trump. 
The New York Times story on Janu-
ary 26 and again on January 31 are 
clear examples of an attempt to bring 
doubt on the information and witness 
testimony. Both stories stated that 
someone had read the pending John 
Bolton book manuscript and that in 
the book, Bolton stated that President 
Trump had talked about investigations 
in 
exchange 
for 
aid 
funding 
for 
Ukraine. The New York Times also 
wrote that the book would state that 
Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney 
and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone 
were also a part of the scheme. I looked 
at both stories closely and noticed that 
the reporters had not read the manu-
scripts or quoted the manuscripts; they 
were reports from someone who stated 
that they had read the manuscripts. 
Both stories took significant liberties 
to describe the intent in the manu-
scripts, but the reporter had appar-
ently also not spoken to John Bolton. 
On January 23, 2020, the National Se-
curity Council lawyers sent a letter to 
the legal team handling the book pub-
lishing for John Bolton to inform him 
that the manuscript contained some 
classified information and it would 
need have some edits before publica-
tion in March. Then, on January 26, the 
New York Times published a story that 
someone had leaked some of the details 
of the book, but they had not released 
the actual manuscript. While I am in-
terested in seeing the actual manu-
script, I am also very aware that this 
selective leak was designed by the New 
York Times and whoever leaked the in-
formation to influence the ongoing 
trial. 
It was clear from the earliest days of 
the trial that the House had a clear po-
litical strategy as well as a courtroom 
strategy. During the trial. I had the re-
sponsibility to hear the facts but also 
to separate the politics from the facts. 
Politically, it was best for the House to 
move as quickly as possible through 
impeachment so that vulnerable Demo-
cratic Members could vote for im-
peachment and then move quickly to 
other topics. But since the Presidential 
election is in full swing, it was politi-
cally better for Democrats to make the 
Senate trial move as slow as possible 
to hurt the President during the cam-
paign. That explains why the House did 
not take the time to formally request 
documents or testimony from many in-
dividuals; they needed to move fast and 
try to force the Senate to move slowly. 
It also explained why the House passed 
impeachment on a party line vote, then 
held the Articles of Impeachment for a 
month before delivering them to the 
Senate to start the trial. The House 
managers said repeatedly that the evi-
dence was clear and that they had 
proved their case, but if that was true, 
why would the Senate need to call ad-
ditional witnesses? I think the reason 
is that the witness process was about 
delay, more than facts. 
The facts do not support the accusa-
tion in the Trump impeachment, and it 
certainly did not need to come to this 
moment of national division. While it 
was clear that the House managers

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1151 
February 25, 2020 
wanted to drag the trial on for months 
in the Senate, through the primary 
election season, their case consisted of 
hypothetical story lines and ‘‘presump-
tions’’ more than facts that warrant 
the removal of a President. This does 
not meet what Alexander Hamilton in 
Federalist 65 described as the ‘‘due 
weight’’ for the arguments. 
But impeachment has certainly cre-
ated the division in our society that 
Alexander Hamilton predicted. Over 200 
years ago he wrote, ‘‘The prosecution 
[of impeachments], will seldom fail to 
agitate the passions of the whole com-
munity, and to divide it into parties 
more or less friendly or inimical to the 
accused.’’ This has been an incredibly 
divisive season in our Nation. It is not 
about one person; it is about all of us. 
We individually choose how we handle 
disagreements with family, friends, and 
people on the other side of particular 
issues. Our government represents us, 
so it is up to us to model for our gov-
ernment how to handle disagreements. 
We are now past impeachment, and it 
is time to work on the issues that mat-
ter most to the American people. As we 
move forward, every American should 
speak out on the issues that are impor-
tant to them and the voices that speak 
for their point of view. But we should 
remember that we have much more in 
common than we have that divides us. 
It is my hope that our Nation does not 
go through a season like this again for 
a very long time and that we can move 
past this age of impeachment to an age 
of oversight and accountability. 
I appreciate all the engagement with 
our office during the impeachment pro-
ceedings. We had thousands of calls and 
emails over the past month. We had 
hundreds of thousands of views on the 
nightly Facebook Live updates each 
day during the trial. While not every 
Oklahoman agrees with every decision 
I make on behalf of our State, I am 
grateful most choose to be respectful in 
expressing their points of view. At the 
end of the day, we are Oklahomans. We 
may not all agree on each issue, but we 
can be respectful of each other in our 
disagreement. 
I am honored to serve our State and 
Nation. 
We 
have 
many 
important 
issues to address in the coming days I 
pray we can work on them together for 
the future of our State and Nation. 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, dur-
ing the impeachment trial, this Cham-
ber considered the evidence and heard 
the arguments presented by the House 
managers and White House Counsel. 
During the 12 days of the impeachment 
trial, the Senate heard from the House 
managers for nearly 22 hours, and we 
heard from the White House Counsel 
for nearly 12 hours. This was followed 
by 180 questions asked and answered 
over 2 days, concluding with closing ar-
guments by the House managers and 
White House Counsel. 
Ultimately, there were two questions 
the Senate had to answer when consid-
ering the Articles of Impeachment. 
The first question, for the near-term, 
is should the President be removed 
from office? 
The second question, for the long- 
term health of our Nation, is whether 
we should allow the impeachment proc-
ess to be weaponized and used by a ma-
jority in the House to settle partisan 
political scores? 
My answers to both questions are a 
resounding no. 
That is why I voted against both Ar-
ticles of Impeachment. 
While my Democratic colleagues op-
erated under the presumption of guilt, 
even if one is to assume the worst, the 
reality is the allegations against Presi-
dent Trump were neither criminal nor 
impeachable. They did not come close 
to meeting the standard of treason, 
bribery, 
or 
high 
crimes 
or 
mis-
demeanors set by our Founding Fa-
thers. 
It is remarkable to read the Fed-
eralist Papers and appreciate their 
clairvoyance. Federalist 65, written by 
Alexander Hamilton, was frequently 
quoted throughout these proceedings, 
and for good reason. Hamilton’s warn-
ings to this body of using impeachment 
as a partisan device were borne out. 
Hamilton wrote that impeachment: 
[W]ill seldom fail to agitate the passions of 
the whole community, and to divide it into 
parties more or less friendly or inimical to 
the accused. In many cases it will connect 
itself with the pre-existing factions . . . and 
in such cases there will always be the great-
est danger that the decision will be regulated 
more by the comparative strength of parties, 
than by the real demonstrations of inno-
cence or guilt. 
By placing the impeachment power 
within the House and Senate, Hamilton 
acknowledged that power may wind up 
in the hands of ‘‘the leaders or tools of 
the most cunning or the most numer-
ous faction,’’ which may ‘‘hardly be ex-
pected to possess the requisite neu-
trality towards those whose conduct 
may be the subject of scrutiny.’’ It is 
because of this remarkable power that 
Hamilton argued the Senate had been 
granted the power to try impeach-
ments because the Senate is more like-
ly to preserve ‘‘the necessary impar-
tiality between the INDIVIDUAL ac-
cused, and the REPRESENTATIVES 
OF THE PEOPLE, HIS ACCUSERS?’’ 
It is important to note that the 
Speaker 
of 
the 
House 
previously 
warned about the dangers of a politi-
cally motivated impeachment effort, 
stating in March 2019 that ‘‘impeach-
ment is so divisive to the country that 
unless there’s something so compelling 
and overwhelming and bipartisan, I 
don’t think we should go down that 
path, because it divides the country.’’ 
History has proven that warning to 
be true. One only needs to compare the 
dramatically different outcomes be-
tween the Nixon impeachment inquiry, 
which resulted in resignation, and the 
Clinton impeachment process, which 
resulted in acquittal. 
The Speaker’s warning rings as true 
today as it did when she said it nearly 
1 year ago. Unfortunately, the House 
majority ignored this warning, electing 
to lead a distinctly partisan process 
from beginning to end, based on a po-
litical timeline. 
It began when the House majority re-
fused to provide the President with 
basic due process rights for 71 of the 78 
days of the formal House impeachment 
inquiry. The House majority also re-
fused to provide proper rights to the 
minority, whose requests for an equal 
number of witnesses was denied. 
It is no wonder why House Resolution 
660, which permitted an impeachment 
inquiry, and House Resolution 755, the 
Articles of Impeachment against Presi-
dent Trump, failed to receive a single 
vote from the minority. In fact, the 
only thing that was bipartisan was the 
opposition to the articles. 
The House majority presented a weak 
and completely partisan case for im-
peachment to the Senate. This is why 
the House managers attempted to con-
vince the Senate to endorse its par-
ticular views of separation of powers, 
essentially asking the Senate to do the 
House’s job where it failed: to make a 
compelling case for the President’s re-
moval. 
This is yet another area Hamilton 
addressed. In Federalist 66, Hamilton 
outlined the differing roles and respon-
sibilities between the House and Sen-
ate on impeachment, casting the House 
as the accusers and the Senate as the 
judges: 
The division of them between the two 
branches of the legislature, assigning to one 
the right of accusing, to the other the right 
of judging, avoids the inconvenience of mak-
ing the same persons both accusers and 
judges; and guards against the danger of per-
secution, from the prevalency of a factious 
spirit in either of those branches. As the con-
currence of two thirds of the Senate will be 
requisite to a condemnation, the security to 
innocence, 
from 
this 
additional 
cir-
cumstance, will be as complete as itself can 
desire. 
By dividing the power to accuse and 
the power to judge, the Founding 
Founders further recognized the proce-
dural nature of this process. Appro-
priate procedure would serve to protect 
the Executive from the designs of a 
partisan faction in the House and 
would ensure that removal was not just 
desirable, but truly necessary. 
In this instance, removal was abso-
lutely unnecessary, even if it was desir-
able to the whims of some in the House 
majority since the day the President 
was inaugurated in 2017. 
This addresses the answer to the sec-
ond question I posed on whether the 
Senate will allow the impeachment 
process to become the new normal. 
It would create a dangerous prece-
dent in which the House actively seeks 
opportunities to open impeachment in-
quires to politically weaken and poten-
tially remove the President of the op-
posing party. 
Impeachment is the most powerful 
tool the Founding Fathers gave to us 
to 
defend 
against 
Executive 
mis-
conduct, but it should never be abused. 
It should never be used to settle polit-
ical scores, and it should never be used

as an effort to deny the American peo-
ple the right to decide the President’s 
fate at the ballot box. 
To transform impeachment into a 
partisan political weapon is to dimin-
ish and undermine its critical constitu-
tional role. 
Despite the factions which formed 
during this impeachment trial, I re-
main optimistic about the direction of 
our Nation. For all the bitter partisan 
emotions this impeachment process 
has enflamed, this Congress now has 
the opportunity to move on and focus 
on forging consensus to conduct the 
business of the American people. Con-
gress has recently demonstrated this 
ability—enacting historic criminal jus-
tice reform, agreeing on reforms to im-
prove the delivery of healthcare to our 
brave veterans, and approving a fair 
and free trade deal with America’s two 
largest economic partners, producing a 
win for American workers and con-
sumers. 
I hope, when the record is written of 
this impeachment, that history will 
say that the Senate ultimately re-
tained the high bar which must be met 
to remove a President, that the Senate 
rejected the temptation to normalize 
the impeachment process for partisan 
political 
gain, 
and 
that 
Congress 
turned the page following the Presi-
dent’s acquittal to prioritize the needs 
of the American people and, in turn, 
solve the most pressing challenges fac-
ing our great Nation.

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT J. JACKSON, 
JR. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise 
to express my appreciation for the 
work of Securities and Exchange Com-
mission: Robert J. Jackson, Jr. Com-
missioner Jackson stepped down ear-
lier this month from the SEC, having 
served with distinction since December 
2017. He returns to teaching, having 
made many valuable contributions to 
policy debates at the SEC and beyond. 
Mr. Jackson is no stranger to public 
service. Prior to his work at the SEC, 
he served in the Treasury Department 
as the Nation emerged from the finan-
cial crisis. Mr. Jackson has led by ex-
ample, working diligently to ensure 
the SEC fulfills its three-part mission, 
particularly the protection of investors 
in an increasingly complex market-
place. As an outspoken voice on behalf 
of investors, Mr. Jackson stressed the 
importance of clear and sensible rules 
that put investors first, combined with 
a pragmatic understanding of how mar-
kets work. 
Mr. Jackson brought a law profes-
sor’s analytical approach to his respon-
sibilities as a Commissioner. His care-
ful 
and 
thoughtful 
work 
digging 
through data, developing original re-
search, and presenting it in a clear and 
insightful manner provided the SEC 
and other policymakers with critical 
information and a valuable perspective 
with which to consider some of the 
most difficult questions in securities 
laws. 
Over the years, Commissioner Jack-
son has been a leader on the issue of 
corporate political spending disclosure. 
He has helped to focus the conversation 
on how to think about reasonable and 
material disclosure as our political 
system has become awash in dark 
money. Similarly, Mr. Jackson’s study 
of trends in stock buybacks and the po-
tential for abuse by corporate execu-
tives raised many issues that merit ad-
ditional consideration by regulators 
and lawmakers. 
I would like to lead my colleagues in 
wishing Mr. Jackson the best of luck as 
he returns to academia. I expect that 
he will continue his insightful research 
and scholarship to benefit investors 
and make markets more efficient. The 
SEC 
benefited 
from 
Commissioner 
Jackson’s tenure, and we know his stu-
dents will benefit, too.

TRIBUTE TO KIMBERLY 
HAZELGROVE 
Mr. 
BROWN. 
Madam 
President, 
today 
I 
rise 
to 
honor 
Kimberly 
Hazelgrove for her service and sac-
rifices for our country and her success-
ful efforts to advocate for families like 
her own who lost loved ones serving 
our Nation. 
Kimberly Hazelgrove is a former ser-
geant first class in the U.S. Army. In 
2004, her husband, Chief Warrant Offi-
cer 2 Brian Hazelgrove was killed in a 
helicopter crash near Mosul, Iraq. That 
loss was devastating enough, but after 
his death, Ms. Hazelgrove also lost the 
military benefits her family earned 
serving the United States and that she 
needed to support her family. They lost 
those benefits because of a 1970s-era 
law that causes Gold Star families to 
lose out on financial benefits that their 
spouses paid into and earned. 
For 16 years, Ms. Hazelgrove advo-
cated on Capitol Hill for the repeal of 
that law, the Survivor Benefit Plan- 
Disability and Indemnity Compensa-
tion offset, while raising her family as 
a single mother. She said, ‘‘I was angry 
. . . Very angry for the inequities that 
I was seeing, not only for myself, but 
for a lot of my friends going through it 
and it just lit a fire, and I found a 
stronger voice than I had before.’’ 
My office and I met with Ms. 
Hazelgrove and took up her cause. Gold 
Star families like hers have sacrificed 
so much for this country and nothing 
should get in the way of providing 
them with benefits that they have paid 
into and earned. We worked together 
with colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to write legislation that will fix 
this, and this past December, because 
she never gave up, we got it done. We 
passed a fix in the Senate, and the 
President signed it into law. Because of 
Ms. 
Hazelgrove’s 
perseverance 
and 
strong 
advocacy, 
67,000 
military 
spouses will now get the benefits they 
have earned to support themselves and 
their families. 
Thank you, Kimberly, for raising 
your voice and for all the work you do 
to fight for fellow Gold Star families. I 
am sure my Senate colleagues will join 
me 
in 
honoring 
Ms. 
Kimberly 
Hazelgrove for her exemplary efforts.

REMEMBERING JEFFREY 
HAMMOND LONG 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to pay tribute to Jef-
frey ‘‘Jeff’’ Hammond Long, an out-
standing public servant and friend to 
many. Sadly, Jeff passed away on July 
8, 2018. He was critically injured by a 
truck while riding his bike in Wash-
ington the previous day. Today, in 
honor of what would have been his 38th 
birthday, I wish to recognize Jeff’s leg-
acy of positivity. 
Born in New York City, Jeff enrolled 
at Brunswick School in Greenwich, CT. 
Throughout his many years there, Jeff 
set an example for his fellow students. 
Not only did he mentor younger mem-
bers of the community and cocaptain 
the lacrosse team, but he also served as 
president of the student body. Even 
after graduation, Jeff continued to 
serve the school as a result of the 
foundational experience he had at 
Brunswick. 
Jeff studied at Hamilton College, 
where he was vice president of the stu-
dent body and an Arthur Levitt Schol-
ar. During his time at Hamilton, Jeff 
began his remarkable dedication to 
public service by interning for former 
President Clinton at the Clinton Foun-
dation’s New York office, as well as for 
Secretary Kerry’s Presidential cam-
paign and his U.S. Senate office. 
I had the pleasure of first meeting 
Jeff in 2010. He worked in my Senate 
office for many years, serving as a leg-
islative assistant on the energy, envi-
ronment, and transportation portfolio. 
Jeff routinely demonstrated his ex-
traordinary commitment to helping 
the people of Connecticut and the Na-
tion. A diligent and bright member of 
my team, he always put the needs of 
others before his own, focusing on serv-
ing the people of Connecticut with tire-
less care and patience. 
His incredible wife, Kaylie—another 
Connecticut native and devoted public 
servant—continues to honor his mem-
ory by doing acts of kindness on Jeff’s 
birthday. She and their friends are 
guided by his motto: ‘‘It’s cool to be 
nice.’’ 
Jeff’s natural inclination to support 
others and bring smiles to people’s 
faces touched countless lives from Con-
necticut to DC, and everywhere in be-
tween. He helped everyone around him 
find a positive side to any situation or 
take a moment to appreciate even the 
smallest parts of life. 
I am grateful for the considerate and 
warm outlook Jeff brought wherever he 
went, and I know his memory will for-
ever serve as a model of selflessness 
and unfailing devotion. My wife Cyn-
thia 
and 
I 
extend 
our 
warmest 
thoughts to Kaylie, as well as to Jeff’s 
parents, Nancy and David, and I hope 
my colleagues will join me in acknowl-
edging Jeff’s incredible impact.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DR. PHOEBE STEIN 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
would like to take a few moments to 
thank and congratulate Dr. Phoebe 
Stein for her lifetime commitment to 
advancing the humanities. At the end 
of this week, Phoebe will leave her post 
as the executive director at Maryland 
Humanities, a position she has held for 
more than 11 years. But Maryland’s 
loss is the Nation’s gain. Effective May 
1, Phoebe will succeed Esther Mack-
intosh as president of the Federation of 
State Humanities Councils. The federa-
tion is the national member associa-
tion of the 56 State and jurisdictional 
humanities councils. The Federation’s 
purpose is ‘‘to provide leadership, advo-
cacy, and information to help members 
advance programs that engage millions 
of citizens across diverse populations 
in community and civic life.’’ I can’t 
think of anyone better suited for the 
job. 
Phoebe, a Maryland native, arrived 
at Maryland Humanities in 2008 after 
serving as the director of public affairs 
at the Illinois Humanities Council, now 
called Illinois Humanities. She re-
ceived her B.A. in English from the 
University of Michigan and her M.A. 
and Ph.D. in English from Loyola Uni-
versity of Chicago. 
Phoebe has effectively advocated for 
the humanities at the local, State, and 
Federal level for more than 20 years. 
Even though Phoebe became executive 
director at Maryland Humanities at 
the beginning of the Great Recession, 
she managed to expand the council’s 
partnerships, programs, staff, financial 
support and other resources, and, most 
importantly, its reach. She hosted a 
radio spot, ‘‘Humanities Connection,’’ 
while advancing several of the coun-
cil’s 
flagship 
programs, 
including 
Maryland History Day, Museum on 
Main Street, and One Maryland One 
Book. The organization now offers 
more than 1,000 free events annually in 
partnership with more than 500 organi-
zations in more than 150 communities 
statewide. 
Phoebe has brought Maryland His-
tory Day winners to meet with their 
elected representatives at the Mary-
land State House and here at the U.S. 
Capitol. She helped to foster a respon-
sive environment following the death 
of Freddie Gray in 2015 and launch a 
Humanities Fund for Baltimore. She 
introduced student authors to author 
Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche at One 
Maryland One Book events in 2017. 
Through it all, Phoebe has been a joy-
ful and indefatigable advocate, coming 
up to the Hill or to Annapolis to lobby 
or traveling throughout Maryland to 
bring the humanities to the people. In 
2016, ‘‘The Daily Record’’ rightfully 
recognized Phoebe as one of Maryland’s 
Top 100 Women. 
The National Endowment for the Hu-
manities, NEH, provides funding to 
State 
humanities 
councils 
through 
NEH’s Federal/State Partnership Of-
fice. The councils also receive funding 
from private donations, foundations, 
corporations, and from the States 
themselves. This year, we will cele-
brate the 55th anniversary of the NEH’s 
creation. On September 29, 1965, Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson signed the Na-
tional Foundation on the Arts and the 
Humanities Act into law. The act 
called for the creation of the NEH and 
the National Endowment for the Arts, 
NEA, as separate, independent agen-
cies. More than 200 people filled the 
Rose Garden for the bill signing cere-
mony, including Gregory Peck, Dumas 
Malone, Ansel Adams, Ralph Ellison, 
Walter Gropius, and Paul Mellon. 
President Trump’s fiscal year 2021 
budget 
request 
once 
again 
tendentiously proposes to terminate 
the NEH, the NEA, the Institute of Mu-
seum and Library Services, and the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
In previous years, Congress has ignored 
these proposals, and I am optimistic we 
will do so again this year. I would note 
that Federal funding for the NEH 
peaked in 1994 in nominal terms at 
$177.5 million; in inflation-adjusted 
terms—2019 dollars—Federal funding 
peaked in 1979 at nearly three times its 
current level. 
On a per capita basis, Federal fund-
ing for the NEH amounts to less than 
the cost of a single postage stamp. 
That is a rather paltry investment 
since, as author and essayist Mark 
Slouka wrote in his book, ‘‘Essays 
from the Nick of Time: Reflections and 
Refutations,’’ ‘‘[T]he humanities are a 
superb delivery mechanism for what we 
might call democratic values.’’ He 
went on to say: 
The case for the humanities is not hard to 
make, though it can be difficult—to such an 
extent have we been marginalized, so long 
have we acceded to that marginalization— 
not to sound either defensive or naive. The 
humanities, done right, are the crucible in 
which our evolving notions of what it means 
to be fully human are put to the test; they 
teach us, incrementally, endlessly, not what 
to do, but how to be. Their method is 
confrontational, their domain unlimited, 
their ‘‘product’’ not truth but the reasoned 
search for truth, their ‘‘success’’ something 
very much like Frost’s momentary stay 
against confusion. 
Phoebe Stein understands how im-
portant the humanities are to our indi-
vidual, collective, and civic well-being. 
While we Marylanders will miss her at 
Maryland Humanities, all Americans 
are fortunate that she will be heading 
the federation, where her passionate 
advocacy will extend beyond Balti-
more, the Eastern Shore, and the Cum-
berland Narrows to redound to the ben-
efit of people and communities across 
our Nation.∑

REMEMBERING ANTHONY J. MAY 
∑ Mr. CASEY. Madam President, today 
I wish to honor the distinguished life 
and career of Anthony J. May, who 
passed away on January 20, 2020. 
Tony worked for more than 30 years 
as a political strategist and journalist, 
leaving his mark on Pennsylvania poli-
tics. He used his deep knowledge of 
Pennsylvania history to assist many in 
trying to find the best way forward, in-
cluding during his time as executive di-
rector of the Pennsylvania Democratic 
Party. He served as the communica-
tions director and press secretary for 
my father, Governor Robert P. Casey, 
as well as press secretary for Governor 
Milton J, Shapp and as communica-
tions director under House Speakers K. 
Leroy Irvis and James J. Manderino. 
Most recently, he worked at Triad 
Strategies, a communications and pub-
lic relations firm in Harrisburg, as 
Partner Emeritus. 
Tony also served the public as a jour-
nalist and political analyst for various 
newspapers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and 
New Jersey, and as an editor for the 
Associated Press. In these roles, in ad-
dition to being past chair of the Penn-
sylvania Public Television Network, he 
worked tirelessly to keep the public in-
formed and to support journalists and 
journalism wherever and whenever he 
could. 
Tony was a legend in Pennsylvania 
for decades, and his legacy will be felt 
for years to come. My thoughts and 
prayers are with his wife, Betsy; his 
children, Crispin, Amy, and Cybele; his 
five 
grandchildren 
and 
two 
great- 
grandchildren; and all of Tony’s family 
and friends as they mourn his loss.∑

RECOGNIZING THE WEST FARGO 
PACKATAHNAS 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, the 
West Fargo, ND, dance team, the 
Packatahnas, has returned home from 
the National Dance Team Competition 
in Florida as national high kick cham-
pions. 
This comes after winning champion-
ship titles competing this year with 
the Class A Large Varsity schools in 
North Dakota. It is always cause for 
celebration when students bring home 
a championship title, but this year’s 
award is one of several the team has 
won. 
After more than eight high kick first 
place finishes at the State level in the 
past 25 years, the Packatahnas were 
back-to-back national champions in 
2006 and 2007. Now 14 years later and 
after finishing ahead of 22 other na-
tional teams, it has been especially 
meaningful for these teammates to 
place another trophy in the school’s 
award case. 
The passion, dedication, and time the 
Packatahnas devote to their dance 
team season rival that of other high 
school student athletes. For several 
hours every day, they first work to de-
velop their routines. Then it is prac-
tice, practice, and more practice until 
they are ready for competition. 
At their side throughout this year 
was 
their 
coach, 
Shayla 
Pennick, 
whom they credit for her commitment 
to them in this successful season. 
Shayla knows the thrill they feel as 
champions because she competed with

ished at the top 14 years ago. She de-
serves recognition and thanks for shar-
ing her time and talents to help an-
other team go as far as her high school 
team did. 
Madam President, I join the West 
Fargo High School, the city of West 
Fargo, and the rest of North Dakota in 
congratulating 
these 
talented 
Packatahnas for finishing their season 
as champions. They are an inspiration 
to all of us by demonstrating the good 
that can come from combining a pas-
sion for excellence with plenty of hard 
work.∑

TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JEREMY 
WHITE 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, when 
you do nuclear theory research and 
classified national security work, you 
need a world-class protective security 
force to protect materials, facilities, 
information, and people. Fortunately, 
Idaho National Laboratory, INL, has a 
world-class protective force, Pro Force, 
as was recently affirmed through the 
presentation of the Colonel Sydnor Me-
morial Award. 
Each year, the Colonel Sydnor Me-
morial Award recognizes an excep-
tional participant in the Composite Ad-
versary Team—CAT—Program, which 
trains members of Pro Force teams 
across the Department of Energy’s nu-
clear security complexes to act as 
attackers in simulated force-on-force 
exercises that test the strength of each 
lab’s Pro Force team. This year, that 
recognition was given to INL Pro Force 
captain Jeremy White. White has an 
expansive career in law enforcement, 
including time as a juvenile detention 
officer and a deputy officer in adult 
corrections. Along with his duties as 
Pro Force captain, White also serves as 
Bingham County reserve deputy and is 
a member of the Special Tactics and 
Response—STAR—team, a multijuris-
dictional SWAT team. Before being 
presented the award, White was de-
scribed as an individual who dem-
onstrates ‘‘excellence in the areas of 
character, ability to motivate others, 
physical fitness, tactical skills and 
teamwork’’ by April Stephenson, Dep-
uty Director for Department of Ener-
gy’s Office of Enterprise Assessments. 
As a member of the Senate Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee, I 
am honored to represent people like 
Jeremy White who are so dedicated to 
protecting the energy resources of 
Idaho. Congratulations to Jeremy and 
to all the members of INL’s Pro Force 
team. You make Idaho proud, and I 
wish for your continued success in the 
Pro Force field.∑

RECOGNIZING TALLY MAC SHACK 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize a small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit at the heart of our 
country. It is my privilege to recognize 
a Florida small business that not only 
creates a delicious product, but dedi-
cates time, effort, and money to serv-
ing its community. This week, it is my 
pleasure to honor Tally Mac Shack of 
Tallahassee, FL, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
Despite having a graduate degree in 
criminology from Florida State Uni-
versity and a job with a State agency, 
when the opportunity arose, Justo Cruz 
jumped at the chance to pursue his en-
trepreneurial dream. After attending a 
mac-and-cheese fest in 2017, Justo was 
inspired to create comfort food with a 
gourmet twist. Creating social media 
accounts and a logo, Justo started 
Tally Mac Shack that same day. He 
traded in his 2006 Nissan Armada for an 
old Frito-Lay delivery truck, con-
verting it into the original Tally Mac 
Shack food truck, where he experi-
mented with his mac-and-cheese cre-
ations. 
On October 1, 2017, Tally Mac Shack 
debuted at a food-tasting event and 
sold out within 2 hours. Two-and-a-half 
years later, Tally Mac Shack is 30 em-
ployees strong, boasts two food trucks, 
two brick-and-mortar locations, and 
has established a strong catering pres-
ence 
in 
the 
Tallahassee 
area. 
Partnering with his alma mater, Justo 
established a brick-and-mortar loca-
tion on FSU’s campus and a concession 
stand in its football stadium. 
Since its inception, Tally Mac Shack 
has emphasized the importance of com-
munity 
service. 
The 
business 
has 
partnered with local agencies and orga-
nizations to support a variety of 
causes, including Hurricane Michael 
disaster relief and the Down Syndrome 
Association of Florida. They have also 
supported the Tallahassee Memorial 
Healthcare Cancer Center, the Kearney 
Center for the Homeless, and Fort 
Braden Middle School. During its sum-
mer nonprofit program, Tally Mac 
Shack donates a portion of its profit 
and a free visit from one of its food 
trucks to a local organization. Partici-
pating groups include Big Bend Hos-
pice, Alzheimer’s Project, Inc., Habitat 
for Humanity, and the local Humane 
Society. Additionally, Justo recently 
announced that Tally Mac Shack is an 
official On the Job Training partner 
with Leon High School’s culinary pro-
gram, providing mentorship and job 
training to local students. 
Combined with community involve-
ment, Tally Mac Shack’s modern take 
on a culinary classic was a recipe for 
success 
and 
business 
continues 
to 
boom. Excelling on all fronts, Tally 
Mac Shack was recognized for its com-
munity service as an inaugural winner 
of the 2019 All in Tally Award for going 
‘‘above and beyond to make our com-
munity a better place to live.’’ Within 
its first 18 months, Tally Mac Shack 
was also honored five times as Talla-
hassee’s best food truck. 
Tally Mac Shack is a great example 
of the pivotal role community-oriented 
small businesses play in the U.S. econ-
omy. I commend their efforts to pro-
vide a quality product, while simulta-
neously prioritizing local involvement 
and training to support local jobs. Con-
gratulations to the entire team at 
Tally Mac Shack. I look forward to 
watching your continued growth and 
success.∑

To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-

for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-

tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, with re-
spect to Ukraine is to continue in ef-

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
WITH RESPECT TO CUBA AND OF 
THE 
EMERGENCY 
AUTHORITY 
RELATING TO THE REGULATION 
OF THE ANCHORAGE AND MOVE-
MENT OF VESSELS, AS AMEND-
ED—PM 48 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Cuba 
that was declared on March 1, 1996, in 
Proclamation 6867, as amended by 
Proclamation 7757 on February 26, 2004, 
Proclamation 9398 on February 24, 2016, 
and Proclamation 9699 on February 22, 
2018, is to continue in effect beyond 
March 1, 2020. 
It continues to be United States pol-
icy that a mass migration from Cuba 
would endanger the security of the 
United States by posing a disturbance 
or threatened disturbance of the inter-
national relations of the United States. 
The Cuban government has not dem-
onstrated that it will refrain from the 
use of excessive force against United 
States vessels or aircraft that may en-
gage in memorial activities or peaceful 
protest north of Cuba. Further, the un-
authorized entry of United States reg-
istered vessels into Cuban territorial 
waters continues to be detrimental to 
United 
States 
foreign 
policy 
and 
counter to the purpose of Executive 
Order 12807 of May 24, 1992, which is to 
ensure, among other things, safe, or-
derly, and legal migration. The possi-
bility of large-scale unauthorized en-
tries of United States-registered ves-
sels would disturb the international re-
lations of the United States by facili-
tating a possible mass migration of 
Cuban nationals. For these reasons, I 
have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency de-
clared with respect to Cuba and the 
emergency authority relating to the 
regulation of the anchorage and move-
ment of vessels set out in Proclama-
tion 6867, as amended by Proclamation 
7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proclama-
tion 9699.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. HEINRICH (for himself 
and Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 3338. A bill to establish programs 
to improve family economic security 
by 
breaking 
the 
cycle 
of 
multigenerational 
poverty, 
and 
for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleague from New 
Mexico, Senator HEINRICH, in intro-
ducing the Two-Generation Economic 
Empowerment Act. Our bipartisan bill 
would support an innovative approach 
to fighting poverty, one that focuses on 
addressing the needs of children and 
their 
parents—two-generations 
to-
gether—in order to help break the 
cycle of intergenerational poverty. 
Many current conversations about 
lifting families out of poverty high-
light record low unemployment and the 
booming U.S. economy as proof that we 
are finally headed in the right direc-
tion. I see many encouraging signs, 
such as the U.S. poverty rate finally in 
2018 falling below the pre-recession 
level and Maine experiencing the larg-
est decline in child poverty in the Na-
tion from 2016 to 2017, but I also know 
far too many families still struggle fi-
nancially. Over 38 million people, or 
about one in eight Americans, lived 
below the poverty line in 2018. This 
sadly includes nearly 13 million chil-
dren, 
including 
35,000 
children 
in 
Maine. 
Despite 
recent 
progress, 
Maine’s child poverty rate is still high-
er than all the other New England 
states. 
In addition to recognizing the contin-
ued need to lift up families and provide 
a brighter future for our Nation’s 
youth, the economic motivation for ad-
dressing 
intergenerational 
poverty 
points to one simple fact—we must do 
something different. It is estimated 
that child poverty costs the U.S. be-
tween $800 billion and $1.1 trillion a 
year. For a sense of scale, the high end 
estimate of $1.1 trillion annually is 
similar to the amount Congress appro-
priated in December to fund programs 
across the entire government. 
Our legislation marks an important 
first step toward reevaluating our ap-
proach to poverty-reducing programs 
and encouraging innovative, more ef-
fective uses of taxpayer dollars. We 
support an approach that is aimed at 
equipping both parents and their chil-
dren with the tools they need to suc-
ceed and become self-sufficient. Often-
times, Federal programs intended to 
help low-income individuals address 
certain issues in silos, overlooking the 
fact that the needs of family members 
are usually interconnected. Our bill 
aims to change that. For example, 
helping a mother secure safe, high- 
quality child care can have a positive 
impact on her ability to succeed in the 
workforce, as well as improving her 
child’s ability to be ready for school. 
While that child receives care and an 
education, her mother can be con-
necting with skills training to help her 
improve her income. Connecting var-
ious Federal programs that target both 
parents and children with supports 
aimed at increasing economic security, 
educational success, social capital, and 
health and wellbeing has the potential 
to lift whole families out of poverty. 
Listen to the story of Ambrosia Ross, 
a mother of three from Washington 
County, Maine, who was part of the 
first cohort of participants at Family 
Futures Downeast, a two-generation 
program designed to improve economic 
outcomes 
for 
low-income 
families 
through post-secondary education for 
parents at the same time their children 
access high quality early childhood 
education. In a testimonial about her 
experience, Ambrosia says, ‘‘Family 
Futures Downeast opened up a whole 
new world, not just for me but also for 
my children . . . . Both of my boys 
talk about going to ‘‘Mama’s school’’ 
and assure me that they are going to 
go to college also! They watch me 
doing homework and ask to do theirs 
as well. It means so much to me to 
know that not only has FFD changed 
my life but also set my children on a 
brand new path.’’ In addition to con-
tinuing to attend college full time, 
Ambrosia is putting her new skills and 
education into practice by serving as a 
WIC Breastfeeding Peer Support Coun-
selor. Her sons are also both eager to 
continue 
learning 
and 
her 
young 
daughter is already a ‘‘wanna-be read-
er.’’ 
Family Futures Downeast is just one 
example of the great strides we have 
made in bringing communities and 
service providers together to imple-
ment two-generation strategies. By 
blending federal dollars with the help 
of the State of Maine, Family Futures 
Downeast has reached nearly 230 indi-
viduals in Maine’s most impoverished 
county with astounding results. In 2015 
when the program was just getting 
started, I was proud to support Family 
Future Downeast’s application to par-
ticipate in a federal demonstration 
project aimed at combatting rural 
child poverty, which provided critical 
technical assistance and, with addi-
tional 
support 
from 
the 
John 
T. 
Gorman 
Foundation 
in 
Portland, 
helped the program get off the ground. 
The legislation we are introducing 
today would build on efforts like Fam-
ily Futures Downeast that are increas-
ing opportunities for families in need 
across the country by funding projects 
that work. 
Specifically, 
the 
Two-Generation 
Economic Empowerment Act would 
create 
an 
Interagency 
Council 
on 
Multigenerational Poverty and Eco-
nomic Mobility to better coordinate 
federal efforts aimed at supporting vul-
nerable families and moving them out 
of poverty. The Council would also 
make recommendations to Congress on 
ways to improve coordination of anti- 
poverty programs and to identify best 
practices. While I applaud ongoing ef-
forts across the federal government to 
implement two-generation strategies, 
this 
Council 
is 
needed 
to 
tackle 
logistical challenges, such as lack of 
coordination 
and 
communication 
across federal agencies—and in some 
cases different departments within a 
single agency—and improve the dis-
semination of information and best 
practices. 
Our bill would also authorize a pilot 
program that would provide additional 
flexibility for states and local govern-
ments to improve the administration 
of 
programs 
using 
Two-Generation 
models. It would authorize five states 
to participate in Two-Generation Per-
formance Partnerships, allowing states 
to achieve reductions in poverty by 
blending 
similarly 
purposed 
funds 
across multiple federal programs. Two- 
generation approaches are often cre-
ated ‘‘from the bottom up,’’ meaning 
local organizations and states are at

the forefront of responding to local or 
regional needs. Therefore, our role as 
federal policymakers should be to give 
states and local organizations the flexi-
bility they need to be creative in solv-
ing their unique challenges. For this 
reason, our legislation would reduce 
duplicative reporting and application 
requirements that may deter local 
agencies and organizations from mak-
ing the most effective use of taxpayer 
dollars. To ensure accountability, the 
bill would require that these pilot pro-
grams be targeted at specific, poverty- 
reducing outcomes. 
While federal programs have helped 
many of those living in poverty man-
age day-to-day hardships, they are fall-
ing short of breaking the cycle of pov-
erty that has trapped too many fami-
lies. With this bill, we have the chance 
to make a permanent difference in the 
lives of families and to break the 
multigenerational cycle of poverty. 
Just as a child’s ZIP code should not 
determine his or her future success, so 
should the bureaucratic siloed ap-
proach to poverty not make it so dif-
ficult for families to get the help they 
need to escape poverty. The federal 
government can be an effective partner 
in providing opportunities for parents 
and their children, lifting up families, 
and in turn, building stronger commu-
nities. State and local governments 
can be at the forefront of these efforts, 
and the increased flexibility proposed 
by this bill would help reform practices 
across government. 
In addition to strong support from 
national organizations like Ascend at 
the Aspen Institute, I want to thank 
the Maine Community Action Associa-
tion and the Maine Head Start Direc-
tors Association for endorsing this im-
portant legislation. I also thank Sen-
ator HEINRICH for his continued leader-
ship and urge my colleagues to support 
this innovative approach to moving 
families out of poverty by giving them 
the tools they need to succeed.

RECOGNIZING CHARLES ‘‘RANDY’’ 
RANDAL BENJAMIN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Charles 
‘‘Randy’’ Randal Benjamin, who passed away 
on Wednesday, February 12, at the age of 70. 
Randy was born on February 23, 1949, in 
Pontotoc County, Mississippi. He graduated 
from Hurricane High School in 1967 and later 
answered the call to serve our great nation in 
the United States Air Force. 
In 1970, Randy married Pat Graham, and 
they remained together for over 49 years and 
had two children. He started his business, 
Connect Two, Inc., in 2001 in Pontotoc. Randy 
was an active member at First Baptist Church 
in Pontotoc and set an example of faith for his 
family to follow. He was an avid bass fisher-
man and a proud charter member of the 
Pontotoc Bass Club. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Pat 
Benjamin; his daughter, Tonya Shirley; his 
son, 
Chip 
Benjamin; 
his 
grandchildren, 
Lindsey Claire Shirley, Ryan Shirley, Harper 
Benjamin, and Tripp Benjamin, as well as 
many friends and extended family members. 
Randy’s life was one of service, grace, and 
love for his family and community. He will be 
greatly missed by all whom he encountered.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND 
EFFORTS OF LT. COL. JIM CANNON 
HON. CAROL D. MILLER 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize retired Lieutenant Colonel Jim 
Cannon for his efforts in pioneering the Na-
tional Workforce Awards. Located in Athens, 
West Virginia, this company’s sole purpose is 
to provide national awards for employers that 
want to appreciate, encourage, and motivate 
exceptional employees. Given after fulfillment 
of stringent criteria, these awards include the 
National Economic Welfare Medal, The Na-
tional Productivity Cross, The National Distin-
guished Service Star, and The National Order 
of Job Formation. 
Lieutenant Colonel Cannon has truly dedi-
cated his life to civil service. In 1965, he 
joined the Army and would serve for a total of 
34 years as both an active duty and reserve 
officer. He received the Legion of Merit award 
in 1983 for eighteen years of exceptional meri-
torious conduct. After retiring from the military, 
he worked in the private sector as a Corpora-
tion Manager, yet he still involved himself in 
publics affairs by becoming the Mayor of 
Princeton, West Virginia, in 1984 and serving 
until 1988. 
In 1993, Lieutenant Colonel Cannon be-
came the Vice President of Business and Fi-
nance at Concord University. This is where he 
came up with the idea to create a company 
that honors those that go above and beyond 
for their employers: while at work one unfortu-
nate evening, Concord University’s South 
Tower Residence Hall was caught ablaze by a 
student’s candle. The Athens Fire Department 
quickly put out the fire, but students on two 
floors of the residence hall were displaced be-
cause of structural damage and fire extin-
guisher residue. The custodial staff at Concord 
worked around the clock to make the dorms 
habitable for the students effected, resulting in 
many moving back-in only after 24 hours. 
Lieutenant Colonel Cannon wished he could 
have put a medal on each and every commu-
nity member, including Concord’s Staff and 
the firefighters, that went above the call of 
duty to overcome this terrible accident. This is 
why he started the National Workforce Awards 
in 2015 to honor people across our nation that 
have done similar acts of excellence for their 
employers. I commend the National Workforce 
Awards for encouraging higher productivity, 
more innovation, and a strong, completive 
work ethic. 
May God bless Lieutenant Colonel Cannon, 
and may he continue his work in recognizing 
great Americans throughout our country.

CONGRATULATING 
TRACEY 
CHILDRESS 
AS 
THE 
HOT 
SPRINGS ARKANSAS WOMAN OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Ms. Tracey Childress of 
Hot Springs on her recognition as the Hot 
Springs 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce’s 
2020 
Woman of the Year. 
This award is given yearly by the Chamber 
of Commerce based on the impact that mem-
bers of a community have on their fellow man. 
Since she moved to Arkansas in 1992, Ms. 
Childress has been a vital part of the Hot 
Springs area, specifically in her work with the 
Cooper Anthony Mercy Child Advocacy Center 
where she has served as Director since Janu-
ary 2019. She worked as a forensic inter-
viewer for several years, often cited as one of 
Arkansas’ leading experts on Child First Fo-
rensic Interview Protocol. 
In addition to her work, she is also a re-
spected and active member of her church, a 
state and national forensic interview instructor, 
a certified law enforcement instructor, and a 
beloved mentor in the local YMCA Reach and 
Rise Program. 
Ms. Childress provides this nation with a 
perfect example of what service can accom-
plish in a community both professionally and 
personally. I am proud to call her a friend and 
a fellow Fourth District citizen. I take this time 
to congratulate her on her success as Woman 
of the Year and thank her for her continued 
service to the young people around us.

IN HONOR OF DR. MANUEL 
‘‘MANNY’’ LOPEZ 
HON. JULIA BROWNLEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor the remarkable life of 
Dr. Manuel ‘‘Manny’’ Lopez and his over 50 
years of public service to the City of Oxnard. 
During his time as a dedicated public servant 
and throughout his career, Manny exhibited 
outstanding leadership, innovative community 
interaction, and distinguished professionalism, 
and he paved the way for future leaders to 
continue his unparalleled legacy of service to 
the community. 
Manny was born in Oxnard, California on 
June 1, 1927 to immigrant parents who fled 
the Mexican Revolution. A son of farmworkers, 
Manny would graduate from Oxnard High 
School and Ventura College before finishing 
his undergrad at San Diego State University. 
It was shortly after that he attended the Uni-
versity of California Berkley School of Optom-
etry. In 1962, Manny opened the first bilingual 
optometry practice in the community and 
served patients for over 50 years until his re-
tirement in 2016. 
In 1978, Manny became the first Latino to 
be elected to the Oxnard City Council. He 
served as a member of the Oxnard City Coun-
cil until 1992, when he became the first elect-
ed Latino Mayor of Oxnard. He served as 
Mayor until 2004. After serving as the Mayor 
of Oxnard for over a decade, Manny took a 
four-year break from public service. Manny re-
turned to local government in 2008 when he 
was elected as the Commissioner to the Port 
of Hueneme five-member Board of Harbor 
Commissioners. He served as a Harbor Com-
missioner until his passing in 2020. 
Manny devoted his time to giving back to 
the community and served on many local 
boards including the Oxnard Chamber of 
Commerce Board, Oxnard Community Rela-
tions Commission, City of Oxnard Redevelop-
ment Agency, Oxnard College Foundation, 
Oxnard Planning Commission, Tri-County Op-
tometric Association, and the Boys and Girls 
Club of Oxnard. He dedicated his life to help-
ing those around him and was a founding 
member of several service-oriented and phil-
anthropic groups including the CSUCI Founda-
tion, Sister City Oxnard-Ocotla´n, Ventura 
County 
Community 
Foundation’s 
Destino 
Fund, and the Ventura County Community 
Foundation Women’s Legacy Fund. 
Throughout his life, Manny embodied the 
spirit of giving back, and his more than five 
decades in public service is evidence of his 
passion for making Oxnard a thriving commu-
nity for everyone.

February 25, 2020 
I personally knew Manny to be a kind soul, 
who was a loving father, wonderful husband, 
and respected leader throughout our commu-
nity. I will especially remember Manny for his 
big heart and thoughtfulness. He often pro-
vided me with words of advice and wisdom 
that continue to guide my work in public serv-
ice. 
For these reasons, it is with great honor that 
I offer Dr. Manuel ‘‘Manny’’ Lopez my heartfelt 
appreciation for his years of outstanding serv-
ice to the City of Oxnard and unwavering dedi-
cation to our community during his exemplary 
career. On behalf of the people of Oxnard and 
a very grateful community, whom he served 
with distinction, I express my sincere condo-
lences to his family and friends, and to all who 
knew him.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FOUNDING OF MIS-
SOURI UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE 
AND TECHNOLOGY 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the 150th anniversary of 
the founding of Missouri University of Science 
and Technology (Missouri S&T). Missouri S&T 
was originally established in 1870 as the Uni-
versity of Missouri School of Miners and Met-
allurgy, and it was the first technical institute 
west of the Mississippi River. In the last 150 
years, Missouri S&T has grown into a world- 
class engineering school. While its name has 
changed over time, its focus has remained the 
same: to prepare the best young minds in Mis-
souri and around the world to tackle the chal-
lenging technical demands of the modern era. 
Missouri S&T students achieve a level of 
success that is unmatched, in large part be-
cause of campus programs that emphasize 
practical experience. This enables S&T grad-
uates to combine their studies with real-world 
practice and execution and prepare for the 
workforce. For instance, students can compete 
on one of 18 competitive ‘‘design teams’’ to 
build optimized models of systems such as a 
Baja off-roader or an underwater robot. The 
skills learned in these applied programs ben-
efit S&T students after graduation, and 92 per-
cent of recent graduates find employment or 
gain admission to additional schooling within 6 
months of graduation. 
Being a student at Missouri S&T is both 
work and play. One fun tradition at S&T is to 
put on two full weeks of celebrations for St. 
Patrick’s Day—St. Patrick being the patron 
saint of engineers. This tradition has been 
going on for 112 years, and preparation for 
the two weeks of celebration takes place all 
year, during which Miners count down to the 
next ‘‘Greatest St. Pats Ever.’’ A wagon with 
St. Pat aboard leads the annual parade 
through Rolla with families and alumni lining 
the street to greet the figure. After the two- 
hour parade, festivities kick off with concerts 
and food vendors, and they go through the 
night. 
I’m proud to represent Missouri S&T and 
honored to commemorate the 150th anniver-
sary of its founding. Miners makes our com-
munity better, and after graduation, they work 
in the defense, engineering, technology, and 
other sectors to make our workforce and 
country better. For Missouri S&T, the past 150

GEORGE JENKINS HIGH SCHOOL 
CHEERLEADING CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROSS SPANO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to congratulate the George Jenkins High 
School Cheerleading team for their champion-
ship performance at the state competition in 
Gainesville, Florida. 
George Jenkins High School cheerleaders 
won their first state title while competing in the 
Medium Non-Tumbling Division and beating 
second place by 4.6 points. 
Not only was this the first state title for the 
school in cheerleading, but just the fourth time 
George Jenkins High School has captured a 
title in any sport. 
Prior to this, the Jenkins squad had never 
made it to the finals. However, their strong 
preparation, passion, and unwavering commit-
ment to one another were instrumental in their 
victory. 
The Jenkins cheerleading squad was led by 
their head coach Nashan Davis, who, after 
winning the title, held back tears in stating, 
‘‘The coaches gave them the tools and they 
went out there and did their job today.’’ 
Congratulations once again to the George 
Jenkins Cheerleading team and on their title. 
They earned it and deserved it, and I look for-
ward to seeing them defend it next year.

on May 5, 1941. After basic training, he was 
sent to Pearl Harbor, where he was on the 
morning of Sunday, December 7, 1941. Mr. 
Paredes was heading to mass when the at-
tack began and ran to the first anti-aircraft gun 
he could find and manned it until the attack 
was over, managing to shoot down at least 
one plane. 
Mr. Paredes was then sent to Australia 
where he volunteered to be the nose gunner 
on a B25 that was shot down at sea near Port 
Moresby. Once rescued, he was sent to 
Cairns, Australia and later to Owens Stanley 
Range, New Guinea, where he participated in 
the Kokoda Track Campaign and Battle of 
Buna-Gona with the 7th Division, 32 Infantry. 
Later, Mr. Paredes joined the 2nd Engineer 
Special Brigade from September to October 
1943, where he was wounded transporting 
troops to and from Scarlett Beach. 
After being attached to the Navy and sta-
tioned near Vella Lavella Island in 1943, Mr. 
Paredes participated in the Battle of Tarawa, 
and given a cyanide pill to be taken if cap-
tured. He was later sent to his final combat 
station in the Philippines and discharged in 
September 1945. 
In 1959, Mr. Paredes married his wife 
Artemisa and had four kids, eventually settling 
down in Atwater in the 1970s, working for 
many years as a bricklayer. Though his wife 
passed away in 2007, Mr. Paredes remains 
proud of the family he started with her and 
now has many grandchildren, great, and 
great-great grandchildren. 
Since retiring from the bricklayers’ union in 
the 1980s, Mr. Paredes has remained civically 
engaged. He is a member of Merced Elks 
Lodge No. 1240 and a lifetime member of the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars, where he still 
serves as the bugler in the honor guard. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in honoring the exceptional life of 
Frank Paredes on his 100th birthday. I wish 
him and his family the best as they celebrate 
100 years of a gentleman that has made a dif-
ference and truly exemplifies the values of

HONORING THE PASSAGE OF THE 
19TH AMENDMENT AND THE LEG-
ACY OF SUSAN B. ANTHONY ON 
HER 200TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the passage of the 19th 
Amendment and the legacy of Susan B. An-
thony on her 200th birthday. 
Susan B. Anthony was born on February 
15, 1820 in Adams, Massachusetts. At the 
age of six, she moved with her family to 
Battenville, New York in Washington County. 
Her family were devout Quakers committed to 
social equality and the anti-slavery movement. 
She educated herself on reform issues, read-
ing the early work of her future partner, Eliza-
beth Cady Stanton. 
Their partnership began shortly after they 
first met in person in 1851. In 1852 they 
founded the New York Women’s State Tem-
perance Society. Throughout the rest of her 
life, Susan B. Anthony worked tirelessly for the 
equality of woman and African Americans. 
During her lifetime, women achieved suffrage 
in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and Idaho. Legal 
rights and employment opportunities had been 
greatly expanded in most states. In addition, 
colleges and universities began allowing 
women to enroll and by the time of her death, 
more than 36,000 women were attending 
schools throughout the U.S. 
Susan B. Anthony passed away in 1906 in 
her home in Rochester, saying of national suf-
frage that ‘‘Failure is impossible.’’ The 19th 
Amendment was ratified just 14 years later, in 
1920. I was proud to honor her work by lead-
ing the Women’s Suffrage Centennial Com-
memorative Coin Act through its passage in 
the House of Representatives. This bill was 
signed into law by President Trump on No-
vember 25, 2019. 
The work of Susan B. Anthony was crucial 
to the eventual passage of the 19th Amend-
ment and her legacy is as strong as ever. As 
commemorations go on across the country, I 
am proud to honor her 200th birthday on be-
half of New York’s 21st Congressional District.

LAKELAND HIGH SCHOOL

HON. ROSS SPANO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Lakeland High School 
cheerleading team on their championship per-
formance at the University of Florida in 
Gainesville. 
These students won the Extra Large Non- 
Tumbling Division title at the FHSAA 2A state 
meet despite losing one of their key members 
to injury just prior to the finals. 
Just as spectacular, the Dreadnaughts re-
peated as state champions having won in the 
Large Non-Tumbling Division last year. 
Lakeland High School was led to victory by 
head coach Crystal Abdon who praised her 
team’s grit and perseverance. 
Competitive cheerleading has grown as a 
sport and Lakeland High continues to prove 
themselves as not only one of the best in our 
state, but also one of the top programs in the 
nation and world. 
Again, congratulations to the Lakeland High 
School cheerleading team and staff for this 
victory. Their commitment to one another and 
joy for their sport is admirable, and I, along 
with all of Lake County, are so proud of them 
all.

RECOGNIZING DOROTHY STEIN 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of a dear friend and men-
tor, Dorothy Stein, who will celebrate her 
102nd birthday this year. 
Dorothy was born in 1918 in Owosso, Michi-
gan to Justena (Byrnes) and Matthew Shea. 
While she was still young, the family moved to 
Flint, Michigan, and Dorothy stayed there until 
she was married. She was eventually hired by 
the Flint Journal covering ’society news’ and 
cherished the time she spent reporting there. 
She met her husband, Donald (Don) J. 
Stein, through friends. They married during the 
war but before he enlisted in the Army Air 
Corps. The war ended just as he completed 
his training. 
The couple moved to Detroit and had four 
children, then eleven grandchildren, then 
twenty great grandchildren. She was involved 
with several charities, including Christ Child 
Society. She and Don were also very involved 
in the Academy of the Sacred Heart where 
their three daughters attended school. They 
joined Otsego Ski Club and enjoyed spending 
time there for many years. 
Dorothy played bridge several days a week 
and became extremely skilled. She has been 
a member of the Village Club for decades 
which was the site of much of her bridge play-
ing. She still plays occasionally to this day. 
She drove until she was 98 years old, and she 
continues to bless all with her warm heart and 
beautiful wardrobe. Our community is a better 
place because of Dorothy Stein.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
T. MURPHY 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of John ‘‘Jack’’ T. Murphy of 
Youngstown, Ohio, who passed away peace-
fully on February 20, 2020. 
John was born on December 17, 1931 in 
Youngstown as the son of Irish immigrants, 
Bridget Durkin Murphy and Michael Murphy. 
He married Joanne Mondora on September 
13, 1958, who passed away on May 18, 2012. 
Together, John and Joanne raised seven chil-
dren and taught them all, by their own exam-
ple, how to cherish their family, their heritage, 
their faith and their hometown. 
John graduated from South High School in 
Youngstown in 1950. Upon his graduation 
from high school, he joined the U.S. Air Force 
and proudly served his country in the Korean 
War. After his military service, John performed 
in plays at the Youngstown Playhouse and 
then headed ‘‘out west’’ to pursue an acting 
career. He was cast in numerous roles in 
many performances in North Dakota, but he 
ultimately chose to return to his family and his 
beloved Youngstown. 
Upon his return, John earned his bachelor’s 
degree from Youngstown State University, and 
subsequently earned his master’s degree from 
the University of Akron. John spent his profes-
sional career working for the Youngstown City 
Schools as an Art teacher, Principal and as a 
Truant Officer, retiring in 1993. Also, during 
his professional life, he was a Mill Creek Park 
policeman and proudly served as the 7th 
Ward Councilman in the City of Youngstown 
from 1976 to 1981. He also served as a board 
member on the Mahoning County Children 
Services Board. 
As a proud veteran, John was a member of 
the American Legion for over fifty years. John 
had immense pride in both his Irish and 
Catholic heritage. He was a member of the 
Knights of Columbus and St. Dominic’s Catho-
lic Church and regularly attended mass at St. 
Charles Borromeo Church.

John’s hobbies included fly fishing, wood 
carving, drawing and watching plays and mov-
ies. In addition, after sending all seven of his 
children to Cardinal Mooney High School, he 
became an unwavering fan. John also took 
great pride in the fact that his seven children 
all graduated from Youngstown State Univer-
sity and would always support its sporting 
events, even attending several of the National 
Championship games. His love of Notre Dame 
football was unmatched. Every Saturday dur-
ing every Fall, John would be glued to the tel-
evision watching his beloved team and made 
sure to never miss a game. He also traveled 
to South Bend whenever he had the oppor-
tunity. If he happened to be at an event during 
game time, John could be found with his ear-
phones listening to the game and ready to 
share the status of the game and the score. 
Above all else, though, the most important 
thing to John was his family. He was at his 
happiest when he was attending his grand-
children’s sporting events and activities. He 
was so proud of all of his children and grand-
children, and he found absolute joy in every 
moment spent with them. John especially 
loved to spend every New Year’s Eve with his 
family, when he would ‘‘drop’’ his silver disco 
ball for them as they all counted down the last 
ten seconds to every new year. 
John leaves to cherish his memory, his sis-
ter, Marie Murphy; sister-in-law and brother-in 
law, Adele and George Economus; children, 
Bridget (Chris) Weber, Joanie Murphy, John 
(Linda) Murphy, Jenn (Mike) Ritter, Mollie Kay, 
Liz (Dave) Phillips and Dan (Leslie) Murphy; 
grandchildren, Jackie, Joe and Jake Weber, 
John Murphy, Lynnie, Anthony and Daniel Rit-
ter, Pat, Carolyn and Matthew Kay, Michael, 
Mark and Jack Phillips and Luke, Janine and 
Cara Murphy; his nephew, Dennis Gruber, 
who was like a brother to him and numerous 
other nieces and nephews, known to them as 
‘‘Uncle Jack.’’ 
John was preceded in death by his parents; 
his siblings, Kate Murphy, Jim Murphy, Eliza-
beth Murphy, Hannah Murphy, Peg Tabor, 
Rita Crawford, Betty Murphy, Daniel Murphy 
and Theresa Bartelmay and his beloved wife, 
Joanne. 
Mr. Murphy was a long-time Democratic ac-
tivist, and supporter of mine. He was a great 
public servant and advocate for the Mahoning 
Valley. My deepest condolences go out to the 
family and to all whose lives were touched by 
John.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and service of Mr. James Arrigo 
as he celebrates his 96th birthday. Throughout 
his life, Mr. Arrigo has demonstrated exem-
plary patriotism through his service in World 
War II, and longstanding devotion to his fam-
ily. 
After graduating from North High School in 
1942, Mr. Arrigo enlisted in the United States 
Air Force, proudly serving his country in World 
War II. During the war, he was stationed in 
Japan, working as a bombardier with the 20th 
Air Force 313th Wing. In December of 1945, 
Mr. Arrigo was discharged as a 1st Lieutenant, 
after flying 35 missions over Japan. 
Following completion of his military service, 
Mr. Arrigo returned home to Central New York 
and on April 7, 1947 married Mary Ann Cali. 
Together they lived in North Syracuse and 
raised two children. After many years working 
as a self-employed barber at Jimmy’s Barber-
shop, Mr. Arrigo retired at the age of 82. In 
addition to working as a barber, Mr. Arrigo 
served as a Town of Clay councilman from 
1966 to 1970 and served as an active mem-
ber of the Town of Clay Men of Rotary. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in honoring the life and 
service of Mr. James Arrigo. Mr. Arrigo’s life 
has been one marked by admirable devotion 
to his family and country.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JON 
MYERS 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Jon Myers for his dedicated service 
to Whitley County, Indiana. Hoosiers in my 
hometown of Columbia City and throughout 
Whitley County owe a great debt of gratitude 
to Jon for ushering our region into a more 
prosperous future, and we wish him the very 
best as he retires from his post as president 
of Whitley County Economic Development 
Corporation (EDC). 
Under Jon’s leadership, the Whitley County 
EDC has flourished. As of 2019, Whitley 
County has higher homeownership, a higher 
workforce participation rate, more people with 
health insurance, and fewer residents in pov-
erty than compared to the national average. 
The opportunity and prosperity Whitley County 
enjoy today is due in no small part to Jon’s 
leadership. 
Jon’s career is distinguished, defined by his 
active role in the broader northeast Indiana 
community. Prior to serving on Mitch Daniels’ 
campaign for governor in 2004, Myers helped 
establish 
the 
law 
firm 
of 
Myers 
and 
Hockemeyer and held a senior role with Lin-
coln Life. In 2005, Jon became manager of 
the Indiana EDC office in Fort Wayne, where, 
in the years thereafter, determined to address 
problems facing Whitley County. 
He has worked tirelessly to ensure those liv-
ing in the region have good jobs, can support 
their families and have the best quality of life. 
Although he will no longer lead the Whitley 
County EDC, his legacy will endure, and his 
commitment to the community and state will 
serve as a proud example for others in the 
years to come.

Girls Inc., Girls Inc. Indy opened its doors in 
1969. It has since established programs in 
sixty-one different schools in the Indianapolis 
area with a mission to empower all young 
women to be strong, smart, and bold. The 
people of the Fifth Congressional District of In-
diana are grateful for Girls Inc. Indy, and it is 
my pleasure to congratulate the organization 
in celebration of this special occasion. 
In 1864, the national organization Girls Inc. 
was created in Waterbury, Connecticut to aid 
girls and young women in their navigation of 
society after the Civil War. The new organiza-
tion dedicated itself to creating a safe environ-
ment for young women to further their self- 
confidence, independence, and education. 
Over time, Girls Inc. adapted its programs to 
fit society’s changing social climate while 
maintaining its original values. In 1969, Girls 
Inc. reached Indianapolis. The Girls Inc. Indy 
branch was established, rooted in the funda-
mental values of the national organization but 
designed programs specific to young women 
in the Indianapolis area. Historically girls in our 
country have been excluded from opportuni-
ties due to gender, race, or socio-economic 
status. Recognizing the detrimental effects 
that this has on girls’ self-confidence and men-
tal health, Girls Inc. Indy fights to provide 
young women with a safe place to grow in 
their own capacities and be themselves. 
This nonprofit organization is staffed by de-
velopmental professionals as well as trained 
volunteers, all of whom serve as mentors for 
girls in the program. Staff members are dedi-
cated to providing girls with an emotionally 
stable environment in which they foster edu-
cational, professional, and personal growth. To 
embolden girls in their education and career 
fields, Girls Inc. Indy holds a variety of science 
and STEM initiatives, such as its Eureka! 5- 
year science program for middle school girls 
and its Girls Inc. Day for the inner scientist in 
girls of all ages. In preparing girls for their fu-
ture endeavors, Girls Inc. Indy encourages 
their members to cultivate leadership skills 
and a streak of independence. It has adopted 
programs such as its Young Women in Lead-
ership classes and its economic literacy class-
es for high school girls. However, because 
Girls Inc. Indy recognizes the irreplaceable 
value of high self-esteem, the organization has 
created numerous initiatives that focus on per-
sonal growth. Programs that discuss the defi-
nition of beauty and the importance of conflict 
management and empower young women as 
they embark on their journeys of self-dis-
covery. Girls Inc. Indy has served a wide vari-
ety of young women around Indianapolis, wel-
coming all girls despite age, race, ethnicity, 
and socio-economic background. 
The impact of this organization on our girls 
is immeasurable. In 2017 alone, Girls Inc. Indy 
served 4,299 girls in its programs, reaching 
across four different counties in the Indianap-
olis area. Many of these girls participated in 
more than one program, totaling 8,106 pro-
gram enrollments. 
For fifty years, Girls Inc. of Greater Indian-
apolis has aided the young women of the Indi-
anapolis area in their development, facilitating 
a healthy environment to allow girls to explore 
their personalities, their communities, and their 
future careers. The challenges that young 
women face are constantly evolving, but I am 
confident that Girls Inc. Indy will continue to 
serve a pivotal role in their development for 
another fifty years and more. 
Annually, Girls Inc. Indy recognizes female 
leaders with the Touchstone Award to those 
who have made astounding contributions to 
the Indianapolis community, and have inspired 
all girls to be strong, smart, and bold, enabling 
them to be confident in their abilities, proud of 
who they are, and ready to take their place in 
the world. It was my distinct honor to receive 
this prestigious award in 2008. 
On this 50th Anniversary, I commend Girls 
Inc. Indy on its mission to embolden girls and 
its success in its programs. I wish the organi-
zation, its staff, volunteers and the girls it 
serves all the best in its future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND 
OPENING OF THE LINCOLN PARK 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS HEALTH CEN-
TER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the grand opening of the 
Lincoln Park Public Schools Health Center. 
The new facility will increase access to 
healthcare services, improving the health and 
wellness of many students in our community. 
This endeavor is worthy of commendation. 
Last summer, Lincoln Park Public Schools 
and Henry Ford Health System’s Department 
of Pediatrics announced a partnership that 
would facilitate the creation of a school health 
and wellness center at Lincoln Park High 
School. Months later, we celebrate as that vi-
sion finally comes to fruition and the Lincoln 
Park Public School Health Center opens its 
doors to the community today. The new health 
and wellness center will provide basic primary 
care and behavioral health services to patients 
between the ages of 4 and 21 and special 
education students up to age 26. 
The opening of the Lincoln Park Public 
Schools Health Center exemplifies our com-
munity’s commitment to meeting the increas-
ingly complex health care concerns of stu-
dents across Michigan. The services it will 
offer like nursing care for common illnesses 
and injuries, mental health evaluations, and 
risk reduction counseling will help eliminate 
the barriers that have traditionally prevented 
students in the community from seeking the 
health care services they require. The health 
and wellness center will be a critical resource 
for many and help improve the lives and over-
all health of students in the downriver commu-
nity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the grand opening of the Lin-
coln Park Public Schools Health Center. The 
opening of the new facility will enable our 
community to better meet the needs of our 
students, making it easier for them to access 
the vital healthcare and wellness services they 
need. I am grateful for this partnership be-
tween Henry Ford Health System and Lincoln 
Park Public Schools and the tremendous im-
pact it will have on the students of our com-
munity. 
RECOGNIZING NAOMI REEM 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in recognizing Naomi Reem, an extraor-
dinary woman and a leader in the Washington, 
D.C. Jewish community, who has, for 15 
years, served as Head of School for the only 
Jewish day school in the District, the Milton 
Gottesman Jewish Day School of the Nation’s 
Capital. 
The Jewish community of Washington, D.C. 
is one of the fastest growing and largest in the 
nation. Indeed, according to a February 2018 
article in The Washington Post, the D.C.-metro 
area is now home to the third largest popu-
lation of Jewish people in the country after 
New York and Los Angeles. As we all know, 
a critical part of building strong community is 
access to good education, and Ms. Reem has 
made it her personal mission over the past 
decade and a half to ensure that a vibrant 
Jewish education is available to families in 
and around the city. 
Founded in 1988, Milton, formerly known as 
JPDS-NC, has had just two heads of school in 
its 31-year history. Under Ms. Reem’s leader-
ship, the school received its first independent 
school accreditation; grew from under 200 to 
over 450 students; opened a second, early 
childhood education campus in the District; 
and launched the first Jewish middle school 
program in D.C. in over 40 years. 
Ms. Reem is an expert educator with a 
teaching degree from the Agnon Institute in 
Buenos Aires, Argentina, a bachelor’s degree 
from Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and a 
master’s degree in Jewish Education from He-
brew College in Newton, Massachusetts. She 
has led Milton to adopt numerous curricular 
initiatives in General Studies and Hebrew and 
Judaic Studies, which have earned the school 
a solid reputation, locally and nationally, as a 
forward-looking institution, excellent in all aca-
demic areas. Milton’s reputation has attracted 
major philanthropic support, totaling well over 
$55 million since Ms. Reem joined the school. 
Prior to coming to Milton, Ms. Reem was 
Head of School at Sinai Academy of the Berk-
shires, a day school in Pittsfield, Massachu-
setts, for seven years. Previously, she worked 
at the Gordon Day School in Miami, Florida 
and in several educational settings in Argen-
tina, Israel and the United States. 
Ms. Reem has served on the Board of the 
Association of Independent Maryland and D.C. 
Schools, where she previously chaired two ac-
creditation 
teams 
for 
other 
independent 
schools. She has also served as a mentor at 
the Day School Leadership Training Institute, 
a program sponsored by the AVICHAI Foun-
dation and the Jewish Theological Seminary to 
train new and aspiring heads of schools. Addi-
tionally, Ms. Reem is a member of the Execu-
tives Council for the Jewish Federation of 
Greater Washington and served as its co-chair 
for three years. 
Ms. Reem is a native of Buenos Aires, Ar-
gentina, and left her hometown in Argentina 
when she was 22 years old. She became a 
citizen of the United States on February 2, 
2017.

her early years teaching through her tenure at

oring Naomi Reem for her work and service 
and in wishing her and her school continued 
success.

RECOGNIZING 
PETTY 
OFFICER 
KWAME 
KUSI-APPIAH 
AS 
THE 
2020 
MARGARET 
FLOWERS 
AWARD RECIPIENT 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Petty Officer Kwame Kusi-Appiah as 
the 2020 Margaret Flowers Award recipient. 
This award goes to military members who 
have served their communities, apart from 
their active duty capacity. Petty Officer Kusi- 
Appiah is a member of the United States 
Navy, as well as an upstanding citizen of Flor-
ida’s First Congressional District. 
In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to 
have some of the bravest individuals in our 
nation. Our district has been gifted with a pop-
ulation that is deeply rooted in military service. 
Petty Officer Kusi-Appiah has shown his will-
ingness to serve our nation through his serv-
ice with the Navy, being the Leading Petty Of-
ficer for the Blue Angels’ Supply Department, 
as well as his willing to serve the community 
around him. 
Petty Officer Kusi-Appiah was the Detach-
ment Leading Petty Officer for the 2019 Winter 
Training Detachment, and supported 32 dif-
ferent sites during the year. Even though he 
was on the road for much of the year, he de-
voted 525 hours to the local Big Brothers pro-
gram, the United Service Organization, and 
local elementary Schools. He has also been 
the mentor to a local second grade student. In 
addition to volunteering, Petty Officer Kusi- 
Appiah is the command organizing and certi-
fying official for the Presidential Volunteer 
Service Award, coordinating over 3,000 hours 
of service to the community and producing 7 
awards. 
For all of his admirable contributions to our 
community, I am truly proud to have Petty Of-
ficer Kusi-Appiah as a constituent of Florida’s 
First Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Petty Officer Kwame Kusi-Appiah for his many 
accomplishments, and his commitment to al-
truism and excellence in our district. I thank 
him for all of his service and wish him all the 
best for his continued success.

RECOGNITION OF CHILDREN’S 
DENTAL MONTH 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, February 
has been dedicated as the National Children’s 
Dental Health Month. This is such an impor-
tant cause and I am pleased to help bring 
awareness to the value of good oral health in 
children. Tooth decay is the number one 
chronic infectious disease among children in 
the U.S. The impact of not treating decay can 
lead to other harmful outcomes beyond just 
oral health. As co-chair of the Congressional 
Oral Health Caucus, I am pleased to support 
National Children’s Dental Health Month and 
any activities taking place throughout the 
month of February. 
Give Kids A Smile, which is sponsored by 
the American Dental Association (ADA) is at 
the center of National Children’s Dental Health 
Month. Give Kids A Smile day is an important 
event for all children and dentists throughout 
the country. Because of this program, the ADA 
is able to provide assistance to more than 
6,500 dentists and 25,000 dental team mem-
bers, and other volunteers who proudly give 
their time and effort to make a difference in 
the health of children. Since this program has 
started, volunteers have graciously provided 
services to over 6 million kids across the 
country, and to all 50 states and the District of 
Columbia as well. They have truly made a 
huge impact in their communities and im-
proved the oral health of so many children. 
Throughout 
National 
Children’s 
Dental 
Health Month, dentists and dental team mem-
bers across the country will be providing oral 
health services for children in need, and this 
will continue throughout the year. These serv-
ices 
will 
include 
oral 
health 
education, 
screenings, preventive care and restorative 
services. Some will provide this in their own 
dental practice, others will go right into 
schools and the community to reach the kids 
that need it most. There are also many major 
events at dental hygiene schools where hun-
dreds of kids may receive oral health services. 
Continued public awareness on this issue is 
so critical. On behalf of the Congressional 
Oral Health Caucus, I would once again like to 
state our full endorsement for the month, and 
push for continued care for good oral health of 
children.

REINTRODUCTION 
OF 
LEGISLA-
TION TO AWARD THE CONGRES-
SIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO HU-
MANITARIAN 
AND 
SPORTING 
LEGEND MUHAMMAD ALI 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
as we celebrate Black History Month, I am 
proud to reintroduce legislation to award the 
Congressional Gold Medal to Muhammad Ali 
in recognition of his contributions to our na-
tion. I believe it is long past time to recognize 
an American civil rights activist and sporting 
legend with Congress’ highest honor. Unfortu-
nately, Congress failed to act before The 
Champ’s death in 2016, at the age 74, so I 
ask my colleagues to join me now in honoring 
an American hero. Over the course of his illus-
trious career, Muhammad Ali produced some 
of our nation’s most lasting sports memories. 
From winning a Gold Medal at the 1960 sum-
mer Olympics, to lighting the Olympic torch at 
the 1996 Summer Olympics, his influence as 
an athlete and a humanitarian spanned over 
fifty years. 
Despite having been diagnosed with Parkin-
son’s disease in the 1980s, Ali devoted his life 
to charitable organizations. Ali, and his wife 
Lonnie, were founding directors of the Muham-
mad Ali Parkinson Center and Movement Dis-
orders Clinic in Phoenix, AZ and helped raise 
over $50 million for Parkinson’s research. In 
addition to helping families cope with illness, 
Ali led efforts to provide meals for the hungry 
and helped countless organizations such as 
the Make-A-Wish-Foundation and the Special 
Olympics. 
Muhammad Ali’s humanitarian efforts went 
beyond his charitable activities in the United 
States. In 1990 Muhammad Ali travelled to the 
Middle East to seek the release of American 
and British hostages that were being held as 
human shields in the first Gulf War. After his 
intervention, 15 hostages were freed. Thanks 
to his devotion to diplomatic causes and racial 
harmony, Ali was the recipient of many acco-
lades, including being chosen as a ‘‘U.N. Mes-
senger of Peace’’ in 1998 and receiving the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 from 
President Bush. 
Through his unyielding dedication to his 
sport and to struggling populations around the 
world, Muhammad Ali still serves an example 
of service and self-sacrifice for generations of 
Americans. The Congressional Gold Medal is 
a fitting commemoration of his life and work, 
for which he is deservingly known as ‘‘the 
Greatest.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join me in recognizing one of our nation’s 
most lasting and influential figures by signing 
on to this important legislation.

HONORING THE DAVID A. SOLARI 
POST 151 OF THE AMERICAN LE-
GION 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the David A. Solari Post 
151 of the American Legion on its 100th anni-
versary. 
On November 29, 1919, a meeting was held 
at City Hall in Pittsburg, California to discuss 
a new American Legion Veterans Post. On 
December 18, 1919, the Post received its 
charter and David Irwin became the first Post 
Commander with 47 members. The post was 
named for Private David A. Solari, 91st Divi-
sion, 362 Infantry Regiment, Company G, who 
gave his life in service to his country in the Ar-
gonne Forest of France during World War I. 
Throughout its history, Post 151 has pro-
vided services to countless veterans, growing 
to its largest membership of 567 during the 
Korean War. In service of our veterans, Post 
151 conducts monthly meetings about re-
sources, programs, and benefits for veterans. 
Members of the Post have provided Color 
Guards during parades in Contra Costa Coun-
ty and honored survivors of the Bataan Death 
March. Post 151 has provided Military Honors 
for as many as 40 veterans and their families 
in a single year. Its members also serve their 
community by visiting sick and wounded vet-
erans in the hospital and providing transpor-
tation for veterans to VA hospitals and County 
Veterans Service Offices.

HONORING THE BLACK RIFLE 
COFFEE COMPANY 
HON. ADAM KINZINGER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the great work and inspir-
ing mission of the Black Rifle Coffee Com-
pany, a veteran-owned coffee company com-
mitted to supporting those in uniform in each 
branch of the armed forces, law enforcement, 
and first responders. 
The Black Rifle Coffee Company was found-
ed in 2014 and was inspired by CEO and 
Founder Evan Hafer’s time in the military 
where he recognized the impact something as 
simple as coffee can have on our nation’s 
service members. With a goal of hiring 10,000 
veterans, the Black Rifle Coffee Company has 
expanded greatly from Evan’s basement to dif-
ferent locations across the United States and 
Canada. This growth was made possible by 
Evan and the rest of the owners, all of whom 
are veterans themselves: Tom Davin, Mat 
Best, Jarred Taylor, Richard Ryan, and Logan 
Stark. 
As I have said before, I strongly believe the 
most important part of returning home from 
the military is renewing that mission and 
sense of purpose for our veterans, as well as 
the community around them. It is inspiring to 
see the Black Rifle Coffee Company take the 
initiative to look out for their fellow military 
brothers and sisters—just as they were trained 
to do on the battlefield while protecting our 
freedoms. 
I’m proud to recognize the Black Rifle Cof-
fee Company in this Chamber and thank them 
for their commitment to helping those who 
have put everything on the line for our coun-
try. This team and community of veterans is 
the embodiment of true patriotism, and I look 
forward to watching the mission of the Black 
Rifle Coffee Company continue to grow and 
inspire others to do the same.

NORM HURST RECEIVES THE 
PRESIDENTS’ CHOICE AWARD 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service and commitment of 
Norm Hurst, who received the Presidents’ 
Choice Award from the Victor Valley College 
Foundation on February 22, 2020. 
After serving in the United States Air Force, 
Norm Hurst went on to become a Deputy 
Sheriff for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s 
Department. Within the span of his 32-year 
career in law enforcement, Norm would ulti-
mately be promoted to Deputy Chief. Long be-
fore he was a Deputy Chief, Norm’s associa-
tion with Victor Valley College began when he 
received his Associate of Science degree in 
the Spring of 1974. Not long after receiving his 
Bachelor’s in Criminal Justice, Norm was en-
couraged to begin teaching within Victor Val-
ley College’s Criminal Justice Department. His 
service to the College continued in 2011 when 
he joined the Victor Valley College Foundation 
Board of Directors. Today, Norm continues to 
be an advocate for student success, and 
works tirelessly to fundraise for the Founda-
tion’s scholarships and grants to VVC’s de-
partments. 
Norm Hurst has dedicated decades of his 
life to serving the public. Throughout his ca-
reer in the military, law enforcement, and edu-
cation, he has embodied one of the Air 
Force’s core values—Service Before Self. 
Congratulations, Norm.

HONORING 
THE 
40TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
1980 
WINTER 
OLYMPICS IN LAKE PLACID 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the historic legacy of the Olym-
pic Games in Lake Placid. This week marks 
the 40th Anniversary of the 1980 Winter Olym-
pics, which featured some of the most iconic 
moments in Olympic history. 
The first Olympics held in Lake Placid took 
place in February of 1932. The intervening 
half century saw the massive upheaval of 
World War II and the rise of the Soviet Union. 
The Olympics returned to Lake Placid in the 
winter of 1980 and brought the tensions of the 
Cold War with them. It was during those 
games that the amateur USA Hockey Team 
defeated the heavily favored Soviet Hockey 
Team on their way to a gold medal in what 
was dubbed the ‘‘Miracle on Ice.’’ In addition, 
U.S. speed skater Eric Heiden’s record-setting 
five gold medals helped cement the Thirteenth 
Olympic Winter Games as one for the ages. 
Building this legacy has been an ongoing ef-
fort for over a century. Since long before the 
1932 games, residents of Lake Placid have 
been working hard to make their community a 
destination for winter sports athletes and en-
thusiasts. Lake Placid and surrounding com-
munities have sent at least one athlete to 
every Winter Olympics since the first one in 
1924. In order to maintain that level of suc-
cess, they have worked tirelessly to host other 
major international and national competitions 
that constantly foster new generations of world 
class athletes. It is for that reason that Lake 
Placid was chosen as the host city for the 
2023 World University Games, where over 
2,000 athletes from all over the world will 
come together to compete in 79 events. 
To honor the 40th Anniversary of the 1980 
games, throughout this week there will be doz-
ens of events at all of the facilities celebrating 
athletes from the original winter games and 
athletes moving towards Olympic goals. On 
behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional Dis-
trict, I want to congratulate the entire Lake 
Placid community on this important milestone. 
I look forward to working with local leaders to 
ensure the continued success of Lake Placid 
and its athletes.

to congratulate the girls soccer team of Straw-
berry Crest High School for winning the Class

The team exhibited strength and passion all

and commitment to one another gave them an 
added edge on their run to the district title. 
In the semifinals, the team showcased their 
extraordinary talents by shutting out Tampa

In the championship game against a very 
talented Plant City team, Strawberry Crest 
was resilient in their effort and pitched a fierce 
comeback to ultimately win the game in dou-
ble overtime. 
I congratulate Coach Sean Woodhouse and 
his staff on this title. The time and effort you

IN RECOGNITION OF STAFF SER-
GEANT JOSEPH EUGENE PROKOP 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Staff Sergeant Joseph Eu-
gene Prokop, a native of Scranton, Pennsyl-
vania, who bravely served his country in the 
U.S. Army during World War II and was trag-
ically executed by the German Gestapo along 
with two of his fellow airmen. 
Staff Sergeant Prokop, son of John and 
Anna Prokop, enlisted in the army in 1939 at 
the age of seventeen. In 1945 near the end of 
World War II, while on his fiftieth mission in 
the air corps, the B–17 bomber he was man-
ning took anti-aircraft fire over Frankfurt, Ger-
many and crashed in the city of Hanau. Until 
recently, it was believed that Prokop and the 
rest of the plane’s crew died in the crash. 
However, historians in Hanau recently dis-
covered that Prokop and two of his fellow air-
men—Technical Sergeant Charles Bernard 
Goldstein and Technical Sergeant Warren 
George Hammond—survived the attack but 
were subsequently captured by Hanau police 
and turned over to the Gestapo. Upon learning 
that one of the three men was Jewish, a Ge-
stapo director ordered all three men to be exe-
cuted.

Following this discovery, the German Con-
sulate sought to contact Staff Sergeant 
Prokop’s surviving family to inform them of the 
true cause of his death and extend an offer to 
honor him in his hometown as well as in 
Hanau. 
On February 17, 2020—the seventy-fifth an-

of 
the 
killings—Staff 
Sergeant 
Prokop was honored with a remembrance 
service organized by the General Theodore J. 
Wint Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 25 at his 
gravesite at the Scranton Cathedral Cemetery. 
His sister, Ann Spearmint, was in attendance. 
That same day, the city of Hanau, Germany 
memorialized Prokop and his fellow airmen by 
erecting a plaque at the site of their execution. 
It is an honor to recognize Staff Sergeant 
Prokop, who made the ultimate sacrifice for 
our nation at a perilous time in our world’s his-
tory. May his commitment to defending the 
United States and the democratic world order 
never be forgotten.

SUPERINTENDENT 
OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to announce my constituent, Dr. Gustavo 
Balderas, superintendent of Eugene School 
District 4J, was named Superintendent of the 
Year by the American Association of School 
Administrators. Dr. Balderas now makes three 
Oregon superintendents that have won the 
prestigious award, two of which hail from Or-
egon’s Fourth Congressional District. 
Education has long been a passion for Dr. 
Balderas. He is the proud son of migrant par-
ents from Piedras Negras, Cohauila Mexico— 
who, like many migrants, sought a better life 
for their family in the United States. His par-
ents saw getting an education as a path for-
ward for their son and pushed him to follow 
this track. 
Dr. Balderas is an Oregonian through and 
through—beginning his education in the Nyssa 
School District and Treasure Valley Commu-
nity College in Eastern Oregon, earning a 
bachelor’s degree from Western Oregon Uni-
versity and then a master’s degree from Port-
land State University, and, finally, receiving his 
doctorate from the University of Oregon. He 
has spent nearly all his 30-year career in Or-
egon. 
I am not surprised the American Association 
of School Administrators bestowed their distin-
guished award to Dr. Balderas. He is well- 
known and well-respected throughout the state 
for his leadership in education equity. Dr. 
Balderas is committed to mentoring and pro-
viding counsel and direction to the future lead-
ers of our state’s school districts. 
He has made great strides in increasing the 
diversity of Eugene 4J’s educator workforce. 
Under his leadership, 30 percent of all district 
administrators, including 39 percent of school 
principals, are people of color, more accu-
rately reflecting the district’s 31 percent enroll-
ment among students of color. 
He has also partnered with community orga-
nizations to combat youth and family home-
lessness in our district. 
In accepting his award, Dr. Balderas said: 
‘‘This is a ‘we’ award, not a ‘me’ award’’—ac-
cepting the award on behalf of his community 
rather than himself. I am thrilled that Eugene 
4J has such a dedicated, yet modest, leader 
who recognizes the important work educators 
contribute towards making our public schools 
exceptional. In fact, it was the educators in his 
life that inspired him to follow this path. They 
made him a better student and the role model 
he is today. 
Dr. Balderas’ talents were cultivated in Or-
egon’s public schools, and today our commu-
nity is reaping the rewards from his capacity, 
capability, and commitment. I am honored to 
have an educator of Dr. Balderas’ caliber 
serve our community, and I thank him for the 
outstanding work he has done and will con-
tinue to do on behalf of the students of Eu-
gene 4J and all of public education.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
RILEY 
DOLENCE 
FOR 
HER 
REMARK-
ABLE ACHIEVEMENTS IN CREW 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Riley Dolence for her ac-
complishments in crew. As a four-time world 
record holder, Riley’s impressive achieve-
ments are worthy of commendation. 
Riley Dolence is a student at Trenton High 
School in Michigan. Beyond academics, Riley 
is an accomplished athlete who has recently 
earned a host of awards and accolades for 
her involvement in crew. Since last November, 
Riley has set four world records in her age 
group including the records for most meters 
on the erg in sixty minutes, most meters on 
the erg in four minutes, fastest time to com-
plete a half marathon, and fastest time to 
complete a full marathon. Despite her over-
whelming success, Riley hopes to earn even 
more world records in the coming months. 
Riley Dolence’s success in crew is a testa-
ment to her unrelenting hard work and dedica-
tion to the sport. As a genuine and enthusi-
astic team-player, Riley is regarded by her 
teammates and coaches as a humble and 
passionate leader who motivates others to do 
their best. Even as a junior, Riley already un-
derstand the importance of commitment and 
discipline. She will carry these values through-
out all her future endeavors, and we are con-
fident she will continue to achieve greatness. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Riley Dolence for her remark-
able achievements in crew. It is clear Riley’s 
future is bright, and we all wish her continued 
success in the years ahead.

TRIBUTE TO REVEREND GEORGE 
WALKER SMITH 
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise with admiration and respect to honor and 
remember the tremendous legacy of Reverend 
(Rev.) George Walker Smith, who passed 
away in San Diego on February 15, 2020 at 
the age of 91. 
Rev. Smith was a champion for racial equal-
ity and one of the most impactful educators 
and civic leaders in San Diego’s history. 
Rev. Smith was born on a plantation in 
Haynesville, Alabama in 1928. As the son of 
sharecroppers, he faced adversity early on in 
his life, as the local school he attended was 
segregated, substandard, and only offered 
schooling through the ninth grade. After notic-
ing Smith’s intellectual capacity, the plantation 
owner decided to send Smith to a nearby 
church-run school. Capitalizing on his edu-
cational momentum, Smith attended Knoxville 
College in Tennessee and later matriculated 
on to Pittsburgh Theological Seminary School. 
After completing Seminary School, Rev. 
Smith moved to San Diego with his wife, Eliz-
abeth Irene, in 1956. Once in San Diego, 
Smith founded a Presbyterian church in Gold-
en Hill. Smith’s congregation, Christ United 
Presbyterian Church, later moved to 30th and 
Fir Street in South Park, which he led for dec-
ades. 
While in San Diego, Rev. Smith did not limit 
his talents to the pulpit. In 1963, Smith be-
came San Diego’s first elected black official, 
after winning a seat on the San Diego School 
Board. Smith went on to serve on the school 
board for 16 years and acted as the board’s 
president a total of four times. Rev. Smith left 
an indelible impact on the school board in his 
leadership and successful efforts to recruit a 
diverse faculty, at a time when educators of 
color were few and far between. 
In 1970, Rev. Smith founded the ‘‘Catfish 
Club,’’ a weekly lunch meeting that would be-
come a mainstay for discussions on civic 
issues, local politics, and social justice. The 
‘‘Catfish Club’’ created a safe environment for 
multiple views and approaches, at a time 
when the country and city needed it the most. 
In 1976, he was elected president of the 
National School Boards Association. He also 
served on the National Advisory Commission 
on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Preven-
tion, the White House Committee on Edu-
cation and the Arts, the California School 
Boards Association, the San Diego Commu-
nity College District, and the San Diego Crime 
Commission. He was the first president of the 
Citizens Advisory Review Board, which mon-
itored police practices in the city in the mid- 
1980s. 
As a Member and President of San Diego 
Unified School District, as well as President of 
the National School Board Association, Rev. 
Smith was the strongest voice for the achieve-
ment of all children. He was always probing 
the performance of students who would be 
first in their family to attend college. He be-
lieved strongly in accountability for all adults 
responsible for a path to opportunity for all 
young people. Although Rev. Smith retired 
from his church in 2000, he remained active 
and served as a mentor in the community. 
Rev. Smith is survived by his daughter, son, 
four grandchildren, and a great grandson. 
I was privileged to have the opportunity to 
personally witness and appreciate his drive to 
bring people together in order to create a bet-
ter community. I always admired Rev. Smith’s 
ability to keep education at the center of all he 
did; a wise and thoughtful approach. 
I valued our relationship as I looked to him 
as a mentor on becoming a member of the

school board in 1983. It was always a per-
sonal pleasure to be in his company over the 
years. He always inspired me to go beyond 
expectations and do everything possible to 
make this world a better place. Engaging and 
demanding, Rev. Smith was a noble champion 
for justice. 
While San Diego has lost a giant, I believe 
that his life’s work will serve as a legacy and 
example for future generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you please join me 
in remembering and commemorating the great 
life of Rev. George Walker Smith.

JOEL LEWIS RECEIVES THE 
ALUMNI HALL OF FAME AWARD 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service and commitment of Joel 
Lewis, who received the 2020 Alumni Hall of 
Fame Award from the Victor Valley College 
Foundation on February 22, 2020. 
A dedicated educational advocate, Joel 
Lewis has made constant efforts to give back 
and mentor various students from Victor Val-
ley College (VVC). As an educator at Apple 
Valley High School, Joel distinguishes himself 
with unrivaled dedication and energy for his 
job. His passion for teaching and coaching is 
constantly on display as he often goes above 
and beyond for under-served and develop-
mentally challenged students. He has coached 
for seven seasons at Apple Valley High 
School (AVHS) and three seasons at VVC. As 
a coach to economically disadvantaged stu-
dents, he has personally managed numerous 
booster events and donation drives for AVHS 
Basketball. He credits much of his success to 
his wife and children, his life-long friends, and 
his students. In 2010, Joel and his family 
adopted their son, after seeing his struggles 
and that he had nowhere else to go. Through 
mentorship, patience, and love, he became 
the valedictorian of Apple Valley High School 
and went on to study at Georgetown Univer-
sity. 
On behalf of the United States House of 
Representatives, I would like to congratulate 
Joel Lewis on this award. Joel has led an in-
credible life filled with service and dedication 
to his students and community, and he is most 
deserving of this award.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF RONALD EDWARD KNOTT 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the life of Ronald Edward 
Knott, who passed away at the age of 73 after 
a lifetime of service to his fellow Americans. 
Through his extreme courage and selfless-
ness, Ronald became an indispensable part of 
the state of Michigan. 
Ronald was born on September 24, 1946. 
Upon graduating from Walled Lake High 
School, Ronald joined the United States 
Airforce, where he served two tours in Viet-
nam as a mechanic. Following his military 
service, Ron married his wife Dawn and 
began a career at General Motors. Ron retired 
from GM in 1987 and moved to Mio, where he 
and 
Dawn 
opened 
Knott’s 
Dairy 
Barn. 
Throughout his professional career and into 
retirement, Ron’s dedication to service re-
mained stronger than ever—including service 
as Commander of the Wixom VFW Post 3952 
and the Mio VFW Post 4126. Ron also served 
as Historian for Mio American Legion Post 348 
and as Southeast Michigan District Com-
mander. Ron passed away on February 5, 
2020. He is missed dearly by his family and 
friends, and his legacy will undoubtedly live on 
for generations for come. Ronald’s tireless de-
votion to the public good touched the lives of 
countless Michiganders, and the impact of his 
work cannot be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life of Ronald Edward 
Knott. His legacy will forever live on in his 
family and through the countless lives he 
bettered through his service.

IN CELEBRATION OF THE NAMI 
WASHTENAW COUNTY’S THE AD-
VOCATE GALA: TAKING OFF THE 
MASK 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize NAMI Washtenaw County 
and celebrate its 2020 Advocate Gala: Taking 
Off the Mask. NAMI’s lasting commitment to 
supporting mental health in our community is 
worthy of commendation. 
NAMI Washtenaw County is a nonprofit 
dedicated to improving the lives of those living 
with mental health conditions. Established by 
a group of concerned parents of children with 
mental health conditions, NAMI Washtenaw 
County was created in 1984 to address our 
community’s mental health needs. Since its 
humble beginnings, NAMI Washtenaw County 
has grown significantly and continues to pro-
vide critical mental health educational pro-
grams, support groups, and advocacy work 
that address mental health concerns and work 
to correct the stigmas that are so often at-
tached. Today, NAMI Washtenaw County en-
sures thousands of individuals, families, and 
educators connect with the support and infor-
mation they need. 
The Taking Off the Mask Gala exemplifies 
NAMI Washtenaw County’s continued commit-
ment to addressing mental condition concerns. 
Although mental conditions impact the lives of 
many, people remain afraid, unwilling, or em-
barrassed to talk about mental health in fear 
of the stigma that is attached. Thanks to NAMI 
Washtenaw County’s dedication, tonight’s gala 
will help lift these damaging stigmas and un-
cover the stories of people living with mental 
health conditions that are often hidden behind 
masks. The gala will explore everyday hopes 
and struggles that come with caring for some-
one living with a mental health condition and 
encourage attendees to create an open future 
without stigma, judgement, or embarrassment. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring NAMI Washtenaw County as it 
hosts its Taking Off the Mask Gala. NAMI 
Washtenaw County continues to be critical re-
source to many, and its unrelenting commit-
ment to improving the lives of those living with 
mental conditions makes a real and lasting dif-
ference in our community. We are grateful for 
NAMI Washtenaw County’s meaningful impact 
and wish it continued success in the years 
ahead.

REFLECTIONS ON SENATE JUDG-
MENT NOT TO CONVICT AND RE-
MOVE THE IMPEACHED PRESI-
DENT 
FOR 
ABUSE 
OF 
POWER 
AND 
OBSTRUCTION 
OF 
CON-
GRESS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, on 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020, the United 
States Senate determined not to convict and 
remove from office Donald John Trump, Presi-
dent of the United States, who was impeached 
by the House for high crimes and mis-
demeanors, a decision I firmly believe will be 
judged harshly by history for all time. 
I voted for the two articles of impeachment 
contained in H. Res. 755, the resolution of the 
House of Representatives and I rise to discuss 
in detail the overwhelming evidence assem-
bled by the Committee on the Judiciary and 
the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence, which clearly warranted the con-
clusion that the President abused the powers 
placed in him in trust by the Constitution and 
the American people by endeavoring to coerce 
a foreign government to announce a phony 
corruption investigation of his perceived chief 
election rival so he could remain in office and 
continue his misconduct. 
The President clearly abused his power by 
putting his personal interests above the na-
tional interest and jeopardizing the national se-
curity of the United States and, making it a 
perfect trifecta, enlisting the aid of a foreign 
power to sabotage the 2020 presidential elec-
tion. 
When this scheme was discovered and 
made public, the President launched an all-out 
campaign to impede the ability of Congress to 
learn all the facts and hold the persons re-
sponsible accountable by dishonoring lawful 
subpoenas, refusing to provide requested in-
formation, and directing his subordinates in 
the Executive Branch not to testify or cooper-
ate with Congress. 
The House impeachment managers proved 
these actions to the country and the world be-
yond dispute and clearly showed how the evi-
dence warranted the President’s conviction 
and removal by the Senate. 
Madam Speaker, it is beneficial to the public 
and for history to review the material facts that 
have led to where we are. 
In February 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, 
a stunning display of military aggression un-
seen since the end of World War II when the 
maps of post-war Europe were drawn. 
Five months later, on July 17, 2014, the 
Russia-backed 
Donbass 
People’s 
Militia 
(DPM), an organization consisting of pro-Rus-
sian separatists who have taken up arms 
against the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the

Government of Ukraine, shot down Malaysian 
Airlines Flight 17, killing all 298 persons on 
board, including 80 children and 15 crew 
members. 
Presidential candidate Donald Trump would 
later dispute Russia’s incursion into Ukraine in 
a nationally televised interview on July 31, 
2016, when he said of Russian President 
Vladimir Putin: 
He’s not going into Ukraine, OK, just so 
you understand. He’s not going to go into 
Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. 
You can put it down. You can take it any-
where you want. 
In contrast, the United States, the European 
Union, and the international community, stand-
ing in solidarity with Ukraine, strongly con-
demned Russia’s act of aggression and ex-
pelled it from membership in the G–8, the or-
ganization of the nation’s eight richest, indus-
trialized countries. 
In June 2016, at the Republican National 
Convention held in Cleveland, Ohio to nomi-
nate Donald Trump as its presidential can-
didate, the Platform Committee of the Repub-
lican Party made but a single change in the 
party’s 2016 platform and that was to water 
down the platform to make the Republican 
Party more amenable and sympathetic to Rus-
sia and its interests in reestablishing domi-
nance over Ukraine. 
In November 2016, Donald Trump was nar-
rowly elected the 45th President of the United 
States, surprisingly winning the Electoral Col-
lege 306–224, despite losing the national pop-
ular vote by a record 2,833,220 votes to the 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidate, 
Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, the former U.S. Secretary of 
State and U.S. Senator from New York. 
On January 6, 2017, President-elect Donald 
John Trump was provided the unanimous as-
sessment of the United States that concluded 
that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered 
an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the 
U.S. presidential election in which Russia’s 
goals were to undermine public faith in the 
U.S. democratic process, denigrate Demo-
cratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, 
the determined and resolute foe of Vladimir 
Putin, and facilitate the election of Vladimir 
Putin’s preferred candidate, Donald John 
Trump. 
Russia’s interference in the election proc-
esses of democratic countries is not new but 
a continuation of the ‘‘Translator Project,’’ an 
ongoing information warfare effort launched by 
Vladimir Putin in 2014 to use social media to 
manipulate public opinion and voters in west-
ern democracies. 
Instead of supporting the unanimous as-
sessment of the United States Intelligence 
Community, the President consistently at-
tacked and sought to discredit and undermine 
the agencies and officials responsible for de-
tecting and assessing Russian interference in 
the 2016 presidential election as well as those 
responsible for investigating and bringing to 
justice the conspirators who committed crimes 
against the United States. 
Between March 23, 2018 and February 15, 
2019, the Congress appropriated $391 million 
in security assistance and foreign military fi-
nancing support to Ukraine as follows: $26.5 
million FMF funding on March 23, 2018; $250 
million on September 28, 2018; and $115 mil-
lion on February 15, 2019. 
As documented in the March 2019 Report 
On The Investigation Into Russian Interference 
In The 2016 Presidential Election submitted by 
Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III, the 
Trump presidential campaign benefited from 
Russia’s ‘‘sweeping and systematic’’ inter-
ference in the 2016 election through a sophis-
ticated social media campaign coordinated by 
Russian intelligence officers and by releasing 
documents stolen from Democratic National 
Committee computers and the Clinton cam-
paign. 
While the Special Counsel’s report could not 
conclusively find evidence of a criminal con-
spiracy between entities or persons aligned 
with Russia and the Trump campaign, the re-
port noted that the Special Counsel identified 
ten instances of unlawful conduct by the Presi-
dent that could constitute obstruction of justice 
but as an employee of the Justice Department 
the Special Counsel was bound to abide by 
the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal 
Counsel 1974 Memorandum which prohibits 
charging a President with a crime while he is 
in office. 
On April 21, 2019, presidential candidate 
Volodymyr Zelensky was elected President of 
Ukraine, winning nearly 70 percent of the vote 
in the runoff election. 
On April 25, 2019, Joseph Robinette Biden, 
Jr., a distinguished former U.S. Senator and 
Vice-President of the United States under 
President Barack Obama, announced his can-
didacy for President of the United States. 
On May 6, 2019, the United States Ambas-
sador to Ukraine, Marie Louise Yovanovitch, 
was removed from her duty station and re-
called to the United States, culminating a 
months-long smear campaign conceived and 
coordinated by Rudolph Giuliani, the former 
mayor of the City of New York, acting in his 
capacity as the current President’s personal 
attorney. 
On May 9, 2019, the New York Times re-
ported that Rudy Giuliani was planning to trav-
el to Ukraine to prevail upon the new presi-
dent of that country to launch an investigation 
into alleged corruption by former Vice-Presi-
dent Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and to ig-
nore the widely debunked and discredited con-
spiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, 
that interfered in the 2016 presidential election 
in ‘‘sweeping and systematic fashion.’’ 
Four days later, on May 13, 2019, U.S. At-
torney General William P. Barr announced that 
the U.S. Department of Justice was under-
taking an investigation into the origins of inter-
ference in the 2016 election. 
Madam Speaker, it should be noted that the 
Trump Administration decision to shift respon-
sibility for 2016 election interference from Rus-
sia to Ukraine is contrary to the assessment 
rendered unanimously by the U.S. Intelligence 
Community and furthers the ‘active measures’ 
conspiracy theory hatched in Moscow by Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin and the oligar-
chic regime governing the Russia Federation. 
In fact, a story published December 19, 
2019 in the Washington Post, reports that sen-
ior advisors to the President believe he was 
influenced to perpetuate this crackpot con-
spiracy theory by Vladimir Putin. 
On May 20, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky was 
inaugurated as only the sixth democratically 
elected President of Ukraine but it was note-
worthy that the American delegation attending 
the inauguration was not headed by Vice- 
President MIKE PENCE as originally scheduled 
but by U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who 
replaced the Vice-President at the President’s 
direction and included lower-level functionaries 
Kurt 
Volker, 
Special 
Representative 
for 
Ukraine Negotiations; Gordon Sondland, Am-
bassador to the European Union and a large 
donor to the Trump Inauguration Committee; 
and Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, 
Director of European Affairs at the National 
Security Council. 
Two weeks later, in a nationally televised 
interview broadcast June 13, 2019 on ABC 
News, the President stated that he would ac-
cept damaging information against an electoral 
rival from a foreign government, a position dis-
owned in a public statement issued later that 
day by the Chair of the U.S. Federal Elections 
Commission, which reemphasized to all can-
didates and voters that accepting political help 
from a foreign government would be illegal 
and a violation of federal election law. 
On July 24, 2019, in testimony before the 
Committee on the Judiciary, on which I sit as 
the third senior member of the majority, Spe-
cial Counsel Robert S. Mueller III affirmed the 
findings and conclusions in his voluminous re-
port, including that the ‘‘Russian government 
interfered in the 2016 presidential election in 
sweeping and systematic fashion.’’ 
The very next day, on July 25, 2019, the 
President spoke with President Zelensky by 
telephone in a much-anticipated telephone 
conversation. 
In that call, President Zelensky advised the 
President that Ukraine was ready to purchase 
needed Javelin missiles from the United 
States to defend itself from ongoing armed ag-
gression by Russia. 
In his immediate response to President 
Zelensky’s request for military assistance, the 
President replied: ‘‘I would like for you to do 
us a favor, though’’ and announce the launch 
of a corruption investigation against his most 
feared and formidable electoral rival, former 
Vice-President Biden, his son Hunter Biden, 
and the alleged involvement of Ukraine in the 
2016 election for President of the United 
States. 
The ‘favor’ the President wished of the 
Ukraine President was to be performed not to 
further United States national security policy 
since the national security community was 
unanimous in its collective support of Ukraine 
in its struggle against Russian military en-
croachment but to benefit the President per-
sonally and politically in his capacity as a can-
didate for reelection to the office he currently 
occupies. 
On August 12, 2019, a whistleblower com-
plaint was filed with the Inspector General of 
the Intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, 
who after receiving the complaint followed ap-
plicable procedure and notified in writing the 
Chairman and Ranking Member of the House 
Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower’s 
complaint was ‘deemed credible’ and ‘‘related 
to one of the most important and significant of 
the [Director of National Intelligence]’s respon-
sibilities to the American people.’’ 
On 
September 
11, 
2019, 
after 
many 
months, the White House’s hold on needed 
military aid desperately needed by Ukraine 
was lifted as inexplicably and as swiftly as it 
was imposed. 
Indeed, the only material change in cir-
cumstances that had occurred between the 
imposition and lifting of the hold was the fact 
that the President and his Administration was 
now aware that Congress and the public had 
learned that congressionally appropriated se-
curity assistance to an ally under attack by our

adversary was being withheld by the President 
for no apparent national security reason and 
that Congress had not been notified of the 
withholding by the Administration. 
In September 2019, Members of the House 
of Representatives were alerted to a complaint 
filed by a whistleblower within the Intelligence 
Community. 
The complaint alleged that on a July 25, 
2019 call with the President of Ukraine, the 
President of the United States sought to with-
hold $391 million in desperately needed for-
eign military aid to Ukraine unless and until 
it—either through procurement or manufac-
ture—produced political dirt against former 
Vice-President Biden, who was perceived to 
pose the greatest threat to the current Presi-
dent’s reelection in 2020. 
On September 24, 2019, Speaker NANCY 
PELOSI announced the commencement of an 
impeachment inquiry. 
A key witness was Ambassador William 
Taylor, one of West Point’s most distinguished 
alumna, a Vietnam combat veteran, and the 
former Ambassador and then charge´ d’affaires 
of the United States Embassy in Ukraine, who 
testified under oath that he told Gordon 
Sondland, our Ambassador to the European 
Union that it was ‘‘crazy’’ to withhold security 
assistance to Ukraine for a political campaign. 
Ambassador Taylor also testified that one of 
his staff members in the Embassy in Ukraine 
advised him on July 26, 2019, the day after 
the President’s telephone call with President 
Zelensky, that he clearly overheard a con-
versation that day between Ambassador 
Sondland and the President in which the latter 
asked Ambassador Sondland whether Presi-
dent Zelensky was ‘‘going to do the investiga-
tion.’’ 
That staffer, David Holmes, affirmed the cor-
rectness of Ambassador Taylor’s account and 
went on to testify that in response to the 
President’s question, Ambassador Sondland 
replied to the President that ‘‘[Zelensky] is 
going to do it’’ and that President Zelensky 
‘‘will do anything you ask him to.’’ 
When Mr. Holmes asked Ambassador 
Sondland about the President’s commitment to 
Ukraine, 
he 
testified 
that 
Ambassador 
Sondland replied that the President ‘‘does not 
give a [expletive] about Ukraine and that the 
President only cares about big stuff . . . that 
benefits the President, like the Biden inves-
tigation, that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.’’ 
Indispensable to carrying out the plan to an-
nounce the launch of a phony corruption in-
vestigation into former Vice-President Biden 
was the removal of the then United States 
Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, 
the longest serving female member of the dip-
lomatic corps, and an American diplomat with 
a demonstrated expertise and distinguished 
record of fighting corruption and leading 
Ukraine away from its notorious past when it 
was a satellite of the Soviet Union. 
So, led by Rudy Giuliani, the President’s 
personal lawyer, a smear campaign was con-
ducted against Ambassador Yovanovitch, ac-
cusing her falsely of impugning the President 
and allegedly abetting corruption in Ukraine. 
This led directly to the Ambassador being 
recalled from her duty station and referenced 
in the July 25, 2019 telephone call where the 
President stated to President Zelensky that 
‘‘[Ambassador Yovanovitch] from the United 
States, the woman, was bad news and the 
people she was dealing with in the Ukraine 
were bad news’’ and that ‘‘she’s going to go 
through some things.’’ 
David Hale, who as Undersecretary of State 
for Political Affairs was the third ranking official 
in the State Department, testified that he wit-
nessed the smear campaign against Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch and urged his departmental 
superiors to place a full-page advertisement in 
local Ukrainian press in support of Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch, but this suggestion was re-
fused. 
In her appearance before the Intelligence 
Committee, Ambassador Yovanovitch testified 
that she was aghast that she was personally 
mentioned in a telephone call between the 
President and the President of Ukraine and 
stated that she felt threatened and intimidated 
when she heard the President remark that she 
was ‘‘going to go through some things.’’ 
Ambassador Yovanovitch relived this fear in 
real time when she learned the President was 
live tweeting disparaging things about her as 
she testified, implying, for example, that she 
was somehow in part responsible for the 1993 
situation in Mogadishu, Somalia. 
Three Administration officials with direct 
knowledge of the July 25, 2019 telephone 
called testified under oath before the Intel-
ligence Committee: Jennifer Williams, a State 
Department foreign service officer to the Office 
of Vice-President MIKE PENCE; and Lt. Col. 
Alexander Vindman, NSC Director of Euro-
pean Affairs, who was born in the Ukraine on 
the anniversary of D-Day, immigrated to the 
United States with his father and twin brother 
when he was three years old, was later com-
missioned an officer in the United States Army 
and deployed overseas to South Korea, Ger-
many, and Iraq, where he was wounded in 
combat operations and awarded the Purple 
Heart. 
Ms. Williams characterized the President’s 
conduct on the telephone call as ‘‘unusual,’’ 
inappropriate, and partisan in nature. 
Lt. Col. Vindman was gravely concerned be-
cause the President of the United States was 
requesting a foreign country to investigate an 
American citizen, an act so contrary to na-
tional policy and interest that he immediately 
reported the matter to a senior counsel lawyer 
on the National Security Council. 
The third person witnessing the call was 
Tim Morrison, who at the time of the July 25, 
2019 telephone call was Senior Director for 
Europe and Russia on the National Security 
Council and a former Republican congres-
sional professional staff member, who testified 
that the President’s behavior on the telephone 
call gave him a ‘‘sinking feeling’’ because it 
could easily be characterized as pursuing par-
tisan political interests. 
Mr. Morrison testified that he contacted NSC 
counsel and sought to have the record of the 
telephone call hidden on a secure server to 
avoid discovery by official Washington. 
The testimony of Gordon Sondland, ap-
pointed by the President as the Ambassador 
to the European Union and a million-dollar 
Trump donor, was chilling, especially his testi-
mony that ‘‘everyone was in the loop.’’ 
Ambassador Sondland testified that he com-
municated directly with the President who di-
rected him to work on the Ukraine matter with 
Rudy Giuliani, who had no official role with the 
U.S. government. 
Ambassador Sondland stated under oath 
that Rudy Giuliani pressured the Ukraine gov-
ernment to investigate Burisma, a Ukrainian 
gas company that had Hunter Biden, the 
former vice-president’s son as one of its board 
members. 
Further, Ambassador Sondland testified that 
the President conditioned a White House 
meeting with President Zelensky and the re-
lease of security assistance on his announce-
ment of an investigation designed to blame 
any 2016 presidential election interference on 
Ukraine and thus undermine the unanimous 
assessment of the American Intelligence Com-
munity that Russia interfered in the 2016 elec-
tion to benefit candidate Trump and harm can-
didate Clinton. 
In 
addition, 
according 
to 
Ambassador 
Sondland, the highly sought and desired White 
House visit and security assistance was condi-
tioned on the announcement by President 
Zelensky of an investigation into his perceived 
chief domestic political rival, former Vice-Presi-
dent Joseph R. Biden. 
It takes no great leap in logic to divine that 
the President’s intent and purpose here was to 
replicate his 2016 campaign formula from 
2016: invite foreign meddling, point to an in-
vestigation, and exploit it by rumor and innu-
endo on social media. 
Ambassador Sondland asked rhetorically, 
‘‘Was there a quid pro quo?’’ and then said: 
‘‘As I testified previously, with regard to the re-
quested White House call and White House 
meeting, the answer is yes.’’ 
And according to Ambassador Sondland, 
‘‘[e]veryone was in the loop,’’ including Sec-
retary of State Mike Pompeo; acting White 
House 
chief 
of 
staff 
Mick 
Mulvaney; 
Mulvaney’s senior adviser, Rob Blair; Sec-
retary Pompeo’s counselor, Ulrich Brechbuehl; 
Lisa Kenna, the State Department executive 
secretary; National Security Advisor John 
Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser at 
the time; Bolton’s Deputy National Security 
Advisor Fiona Hill; and NRC senior official 
Timothy Morrison, and even Vice President 
MIKE PENCE who Ambassador Sondland testi-
fied he told in September 2019 that the 
Ukraine aid appeared to be stalled because of 
the demand for investigations. 
Finally, Dr. Fiona Hill, who preceded Tim 
Morrison in the Trump Administration as Na-
tional Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eur-
asia testified that after speaking with and lis-
tening to Ambassador Sondland she came to 
understand that United States policy for 
Ukraine had diverged into one track pursuing 
standard United States policy objectives of 
promoting democracy and the rule of law, 
fighting corruption, and protecting Ukraine 
from Russia; and another track solely con-
cerned with achieving the more narrow per-
sonal and political goal of the President to pre-
vail upon the new Ukrainian president to com-
mit publicly to announcing an investigation of 
supposed interference by Ukraine in the 2016 
presidential election as well as a manufac-
tured wrongdoing by former Vice-President Jo-
seph Biden. 
Dr. Hill testified that her direct supervisor, 
NSA Advisor John Bolton, characterized this 
second track as a ‘‘drug deal’’ which she stat-
ed to Ambassador Sondland that ‘‘I do think 
this is all going to blow up. And here we are.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I will further discuss what 
message this evidence sends to us loud and 
clear.

FURTHER REFLECTIONS ON SEN-
ATE JUDGMENT NOT TO CON-
VICT 
AND 
REMOVE 
THE 
IM-
PEACHED 
PRESIDENT 
FOR 
ABUSE 
OF 
POWER 
AND 
OB-
STRUCTION OF CONGRESS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 25, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, on 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020, the United 
States Senate determined not to convict and 
remove from office Donald John Trump, Presi-
dent of the United States, who was impeached 
by the House for high crimes and mis-
demeanors; a decision I firmly believe will be 
judged harshly by history for all time. 
Madam Speaker it is important to under-
stand the seriousness of a determination by 
the House to exercise the power of impeach-
ment, which under Article I, Section 2, Clause 
5 of the Constitution is vested solely in the 
House of Representatives. 
The purpose of impeachment is not to pun-
ish the person but to protect the people by re-
moving from office an individual whose mis-
conduct and behavior is so dangerous that it 
imperils the liberty of the people, the security 
of the nation, or the vitality of the govern-
mental system. 
In short, impeachment is the passionate out-
cry (crie de coeur) of a people alarmed at a 
pattern of abuses and usurpations that evi-
dence a desire to reduce them to accept ab-
solute despotism or establish tyrannical rule. 
The impeachment power is vested in the 
House of Representatives because it is the 
body designed by the Framers to be the phys-
ical, direct, and immediate representatives of 
the People, reflecting all of their passions and 
hopes and fears and concerns. 
So, when ‘The People’ who established the 
Constitution are acting to preserve and protect 
their governmental system and their security, 
there is no higher or countervailing authority to 
which they must yield. 
A refusal by any authority subordinate to 
‘The People,’ including the President of the 
United States, to cooperate with, or honor a 
request for information from the House of 
Representatives when it is exercising its sole 
power of impeachment is simply another way 
of saying that the person in question is exalt-
ing his or her interests over the sovereign in-
terests of the people, the ultimate repository of 
all political power in a democratic republic 
such as the United States. 
The impeachment inquiry initiated pursuant 
to H. Res. 660 by the House of Representa-
tives systematically and methodically revealed 
the manner in which the President misused 
the power and authority of his office to extort 
a beleaguered and besieged ally to conspire 
with him to sabotage the 2016 presidential 
election so that he could retain the office he 
holds and continue to abuse its powers. 
Every material allegation set forth in the 
whistleblower’s complaint has been verified, 
corroborated, or affirmed by a host of wit-
nesses who overcame opposition and threats 
by the White House and courageously testified 
from which three unassailable conclusions can 
be drawn. 
First, the President violated his oath of of-
fice by placing his personal and political inter-
est above the national interest by scheming to 
get Ukraine to announce a phony investigation 
against a potential election opponent. 
Second, the President betrayed the national 
interest by withholding vital, congressionally 
appropriated security assistance to a belea-
guered and besieged ally facing armed ag-
gression from Russia, America’s implacable 
foe. 
Third, the essential purpose of the scheme 
concocted by the President was to enlist a for-
eign country to help him fix the 2020 presi-
dential election in his favor, the very type of 
interference most feared by the Framers. 
The evidence showed that the President of 
the United States abused the powers vested 
in him in the way the Framers most feared 
and worked hardest to protect against. 
What this means in short is that the evi-
dence showed that the President committed 
the trifecta of the most cardinal political sins 
that can be committed in a democratic repub-
lic. 
If American elections are not free, fair, and 
uninfluenced by foreign actors, then the de-
mocracy is extinguished and citizens are re-
duced to subjects ruled by an authority de-
pendent not on the consent of the governed, 
but on the assistance and beneficence of un-
accountable foreign actors. 
The testimony and evidence led to and sup-
ported a conclusion that the President abused 
his power to extort a foreign nation to conspire 
with him to sabotage an American election 
and undermine democracy so he could retain 
his office to abuse his powers. 
Madam Speaker, Ukraine is not just another 
country but a bulwark for the West against 
Russia, its imperialism, its autocratic ten-
dencies; Ukraine is an ally on the frontline of 
the United States’ containment policy toward 
Russian expansion that has been in place 
since 1947. 
Thus, withholding desperately needed secu-
rity assistance to Ukraine not only harms that 
nation but endangers the security of more 
than 325 million Americans. 
The conduct of the President adduced by 
the evidence illustrates the reason for the 
doomsday clause in Article I, section 2, clause 
5 as the ultimate protector of a people and 
system of government in which America is to 
be ruled by American leaders selected by 
American voters without the assistance of 
non-Americans. 
Madam Speaker, the hallmarks of a demo-
cratic system of government are: (1) an inde-
pendent judiciary; (2) civilian control of the 
military; (3) free and independent political par-
ties; (4) fealty to the rule of law; (5) freedom 
of speech and of assembly; and (6) a free and 
independent press. 
But the lynchpin of a functioning and real 
democracy is free and fair elections. 
As I stated earlier, if American elections are 
not free, fair, and uninfluenced by foreign ac-
tors, then the democracy is extinguished and 
citizens are reduced to subjects ruled by an 
authority dependent not on the consent of the 
governed, but on the assistance and benefi-
cence of unaccountable foreign actors. 
The Framers wanted to ensure that the 
President’s allegiance would always be to the 
nation, which is why the text of the presi-
dential oath is the only one specified in the 
Constitution and why the Emoluments Clause 
(Article 1, Section 9, clause 8) prohibits the 
President from accepting any title of nobility or 
thing of value from any King, Prince, or foreign 
state without the consent of Congress. 
The first President of the United States, 
George Washington, counseling in his famous 
1796 Farewell Address to beware of foreign 
entanglements, said the government some-
times acts to make ‘‘the nation subservient to 
projects of hostility instigated by pride, ambi-
tion, and other sinister and pernicious motives. 
The peace often, sometimes perhaps the lib-
erty, of nations, has been the victim.’’ 
President Washington also pointed out the 
pernicious influence of foreign involvement in 
American elections: 
And it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or de-
luded citizens (who devote themselves to the 
favorite nation), facility to betray or sacrifice 
the interests of their own country, without 
odium, sometimes even with popularity; gild-
ing, with the appearances of a virtuous sense 
of obligation, a commendable deference for 
public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public 
good, the base or foolish compliances of am-
bition, corruption, or infatuation. 
As avenues to foreign influence in innumer-
able ways, such attachments are particularly 
alarming to the truly enlightened and inde-
pendent patriot. How many opportunities do 
they afford to tamper with domestic factions, 
to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead 
public opinion, to influence or awe the public 
councils. Such an attachment of a small or 
weak towards a great and powerful nation 
dooms the former to be the satellite of the lat-
ter. 
Madam Speaker, if we are to have govern-
ment of the people, by the people, for the peo-
ple, then elections must be decided by Ameri-
cans, and only Americans, without the influ-
ence of foreign leaders or nations. 
The only legitimate way political authority is 
conveyed voluntarily and consensually from 
the governed to the governors is through free 
and fair elections uncorrupted by foreign in-
volvement. 
In seeking to entangle Ukraine directly in 
the 2020 presidential election, the actions 
proved by the House Impeachment Managers 
showed that the President acted to further his 
own personal political interests and dis-
regarded his oath registered in Heaven to 
‘‘preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
of the United States.’’ 
Instead of advancing America’s interests, 
Russia, America’s implacable foe since 1945, 
has been emboldened and is benefitting from 
every action that weakens or jeopardizes 
Ukraine’s ability to defend itself from aggres-
sion, beginning with the lukewarm embrace of 
this Administration of NATO, and especially 
Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which deems an 
attack on any NATO member country as an 
attack on all, a commitment that has kept the 
peace in Europe since the end of World War 
II. 
The Framers understood that abuse of 
power is the gravest offense that can be com-
mitted in a democratic republic. 
Criminal offenses, the Framers understood, 
could be adjudicated in the judicial system, 
policy disagreements could be worked out in 
the political system, and concerns over mal-
administration could be addressed and de-
cided or corrected in the electoral system. 
But acts that by their nature injure the very 
system of government itself are different, or 
sui generis, and require a different and more 
immediate remedy, and that is the removal

February 25, 2020 
from the office entrusted to the person or per-
sons causing the injury. 
This is done to protect the people and the 
republic, not to inflict punishment on the per-
son. 
The Framers were well aware that some of 
the most dangerous abuses of power were not 
violations of the criminal code but the actions 
of a tyrant who ruled under the divine right of 
kings and they pledged their lives, honor, and 
sacred fortunes never to countenance such 
abuses or usurpations in their new country. 
Consider if you will a small sample of the 
legal acts of abuse and suffering inflicted on 
Americans in the time of the Framers by their 
rulers, Great Britain’s King George III and the 
British Parliament, which they documented in 
the Declaration of Independence: 
He has obstructed the Administration of Jus-
tice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for estab-
lishing Judiciary powers. 
He has made Judges dependent on his Will 
alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the 
amount and payment of their salaries. 
He has kept among us, in times of peace, 
Standing Armies without the Consent of our 
legislatures. He has affected to render the 
Military independent of and superior to the 
Civil power. 
He has combined with [Parliament] to sub-
ject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitu-
tion, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving 
his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legisla-
tion: 
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops 
among us; 
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from 
punishment for any Murders which they should 
commit on the Inhabitants of these States; 
For imposing Taxes on us without our Con-
sent; For depriving us in many cases, of the 
benefits of Trial by Jury; 
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried 
for pretended offences 
The principle the Framers were asserting is 
that removal of the King and Parliament was 
justified not because they had committed 
criminal violations of the statute book, but be-
cause they had and were exercising their 
power in a manner that threatened the liberty 
and security of the people. 
In short, the Framers were declaring to the 
world that their governors had so abused their 
powers that it ‘‘revealed the character of a ty-
rant who was unfit to be the ruler of a free 
people.’’ 
And to ensure that did not happen again in 
the new nation, the Framers wisely included 
Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 vesting the sole 
power of impeachment in the House of Rep-
resentatives and Article II, Section 4 sub-
jecting the President and Vice President to re-
moval from Office ‘‘on Impeachment for and 
Conviction of Treason, Bribery, or other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 
The actions alleged in H. Res. 755, the im-
peachment resolution, and proved to a cer-
tainty by the House Managers bespeak a 
stunning disregard for the values that sustain 
our country and a contempt for the institutions 
that protect our liberties and national security. 
As alarming is the fact there has been from 
the President no expression of regret, no re-
morse, no contrition, no apology, no atone-
ment, no request for forgiveness, no admis-
sion of wrongdoing or even erroneous judg-
ment, and no attempt at reconciliation. 
Instead, the President continues to double- 
down on his previous actions, still claiming, 
despite all evidence to the contrary, that his 
telephone call with President Zelensky was 
‘‘perfect’’ and inviting other countries, such as 
China, to become involved in our nation’s 
2020 presidential election. 
This means the clear and present threat to 
our democracy that moved the House to act is 
a continuing one, which the Senate should 
have acted to remove. 
Given the disappointing failure to convict 
and remove by the Senate, it is incumbent on 
each Member of this body, and all citizens of 
our great nation, to vigilantly be on guard to 
safeguard our democratic institutions, values, 
and principles against further attack. 
That is what this moment in history de-
mands of us and we dare not I falter or fail in 
this moment of crisis so as was said in an-
other perilous time, ‘‘sail on oh ship of state, 
sail on oh union great; humanity with all its 
fears, with all it hopes of future years, is hang-
ing breathlessly on thy fate.’’ 
I extend my deepest thanks to thank Speak-
er PELOSI for the extraordinary leadership she 
has displayed on behalf of this House, the 
Congress, and the nation during the present 
crisis. 
I also want to acknowledge and thank Judi-
ciary Committee Chairman JERROLD NADLER 
and Intelligence Committee Chairman ADAM 
SCHIFF for the meticulous and thoroughly pro-
fessional manner in which their committees 
discharged the responsibilities entrusted to 
them by H. Res. 660, the impeachment inquiry 
resolution. 
I thank all of the members of the Commit-
tees on the Judiciary and on Intelligence for 
the tremendous contributions they made in 
compiling such a powerful and overwhelming 
evidentiary record for impeachment. 
I especially wish to recognize the extraor-
dinary advocacy of the House Impeachment 
Managers in presenting such a persuasive 
and compelling case for impeachment to the 
Senate sitting as a Court of Impeachment. 
Of course, an enterprise of this magnitude 
could not be carried out successfully without 
the assistance, support, and commitment of 
extremely talented professional staff members 
of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees 
and I thank them for the invaluable service 
they rendered to our nation. 
Finally, I wish to express my deep apprecia-
tion and gratitude to members of my personal 
staff, Gregory Berry, Chief Counsel; Robin 
Chand, Senior Counsel; and Glenn Rushing, 
Chief of Staff, for their expertise and tireless 
efforts in researching and analyzing the un-
precedented factual background, legal issues, 
and constitutional precedents involved in these 
proceedings. 
Madam Speaker, it has been said that what 
we do in life echoes in history, and Scripture 
tells us in Psalms 30:5 that ‘‘weeping may en-
dure for a night but joy cometh in the morn-
ing.’’ 
I am confident that if we hold fast and honor 
the values and principles that we know to be 
right and true and good, then constitutional 
government will be preserved and passed on 
to future generations just as it was to us. 
So, it is with love and reverence for this 
country and its people, that I stood with the 
Constitution and supported the resolution im-
peaching Donald John Trump, President of the 
United States, for high crimes and mis-
demeanors and it is why I disagree with the 
conclusion of the Senate not to convict and re-
move the President from office.
