MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—H.R. 5376 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand that there is a bill at the desk 
that is due for a second reading. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will read the bill by 
title for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 5376) to provide for reconcili-
ation pursuant to title II of S. Con. Res. 14. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceeding. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will be placed on the calendar. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
ABORTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, two 
sets of numbers show the winds blow-
ing in the Democratic direction: first, 
the numbers revealed by the vote last 
night in the State of Kansas and, sec-
ond, new polling data that shows how 
overwhelmingly popular the Inflation 
Reduction Act is in the minds of the 
American people. These numbers show 
winds blowing in Democrats’ direction 
on the issue of choice and on the issue 
of the Inflation Reduction Act. 
Today, I want to talk about both. So 
let me begin with last night’s election 
in Kansas. Last night, in the American 
heartland, the people of Kansas sent an 
unmistakable message to MAGA Re-
publican extremists: Back off women’s 
fundamental rights. In the first vote on 
abortion rights since the MAGA Su-
preme Court’s reprehensible decision to 
take away constitutional rights pro-
tected by Roe v. Wade—and which was 
cheered by many Republicans here in 
the Senate—voters in Kansas decided 
by a double-digit margin to preserve 
the freedom of choice in their State 
Constitution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3874 
August 3, 2022 
What happened in red Kansas last 
night is a reflection of what is hap-
pening across the country and what 
will continue to occur through the No-
vember elections. Voters are revolting 
against the extreme MAGA Republican 
policies that ban abortions with no ex-
ceptions for rape or incest and send 
women and doctors to jail. 
Last night’s election was also a dark 
reminder that MAGA Republicans are 
running the show within the GOP. 
Their views are spreading through the 
party like a cancer—views that are re-
pugnant not only to most Americans 
but, as we saw last night, even to many 
Republican voters. 
And Kansas was just the start. If it is 
going to happen in Kansas, it is going 
to happen in a whole lot of States. The 
strong pro choice turnout we saw last 
night in Kansas will continue well into 
the fall, and Republicans who side with 
these extremist MAGA policies that at-
tack women’s rights do so at their own 
political risk. 
f 
NATO 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on NATO, today the Senate will be vot-
ing on the resolution of ratification for 
the Finnish and Swedish applications 
to join NATO. This is a very important 
vote. The NATO vote is a very impor-
tant vote for American security around 
the world. 
Finland’s and Sweden’s membership 
will strengthen NATO even further and 
is all the more urgent given Russian 
aggression, given Putin’s immoral and 
unjustified war in Ukraine. Putin is 
strengthening the NATO alliance, and 
nothing shows it better than the vote 
we will have this afternoon. With the 
vote, the Senate will come together in 
a bipartisan manner and bolster the 
Western alliance in the face of growing 
authoritarianism. 
When Leader MCCONNELL and I met 
with the Finnish President and the 
Swedish Prime Minister back in May, 
we made a commitment to get this 
done as quickly as possible before the 
August recess, and today we are keep-
ing that commitment by working to-
gether. 
Despite the differences between both 
sides, I have always said that when the 
opportunity arises, Democrats would 
be willing to work with Republicans in 
a bipartisan way to get things done. In 
the past few weeks, we have seen an 
amazing string of bipartisan achieve-
ments—a bipartisanship that hasn’t 
been seen—with the passage of so many 
important bipartisan bills in such a 
short time. 
Together, we secured a historic in-
vestment in American science and in-
dustry. We just passed the largest ex-
pansion of veterans’ benefits in dec-
ades. We passed significant gun legisla-
tion. And, today, we will work together 
to bolster the NATO alliance. 
So, again, under Democratic leader-
ship, we want to work in a bipartisan 
way whenever we can, but when we 
can’t, we will move forward on issues 
like climate and prescription drugs 
that we feel are very important, which 
I will talk about in a minute. 
Finally, as I mentioned yesterday, I 
invited the Ambassadors and other dip-
lomats from Finland and Sweden to 
join us in the Gallery during our de-
bate and votes today. So let’s get this 
done by this afternoon. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
on the Inflation Reduction Act, this is 
the second place where the numbers 
that we read this morning show that 
the Democrats are on the move and 
that Republicans are in retreat. 
Today’s news provides another bevy 
of reminders of why the Inflation Re-
duction Act is not only bold and com-
monsense but is extremely popular 
with the American people. 
This morning, five former Treasury 
Secretaries—including 
former 
Sec-
retary Hank Paulson, who served under 
President George W. Bush—released a 
statement praising the Inflation Re-
duction Act and urging Congress to 
move quickly to secure its passage. 
The bipartisan group wrote that the In-
flation Reduction Act ‘‘will help in-
crease American competitiveness, ad-
dress our climate crisis, lower costs for 
families, 
and 
fight 
inflation—and 
should be passed immediately by Con-
gress.’’ 
The bipartisan group of Treasury 
Secretaries also affirmed what Demo-
crats have been saying for days: The 
Inflation Reduction Act will not—no 
matter how much our Republican col-
leagues argue to the contrary—in-
crease taxes for any family making less 
than $400,000 a year. 
Again, our proposals call for closing 
loopholes that have long enabled the 
biggest companies in America to avoid 
paying their fair share. And even 
former Republican Treasury Secretary 
Hank Paulson is now calling on Con-
gress to pass the Democratic agenda. 
He is in very good company. This 
morning, a poll by Navigator also 
showed the Inflation Reduction Act as 
overwhelmingly 
popular—overwhelm-
ingly popular—in the minds of the 
American people. 
According to this poll, 65 percent of 
Americans support the proposals in the 
bill, compared to only 24 percent who 
oppose. More than double the people 
support the act than oppose it. It in-
cludes 60 percent of Independent voters 
and even 40 percent of Republican vot-
ers. So America is on our side. They 
want us to pass this bill. 
Now, contrast the Democrats’ agenda 
to what we have been hearing from the 
other side. While Democrats want to 
make healthcare more affordable, just 
yesterday the junior Senator from Wis-
consin argued that instead of strength-
ening Medicare and Social Security, we 
should put them on the chopping block. 
Hear that, citizens of Wisconsin, citi-
zens of America? The junior Senator 
from Wisconsin wants to put Medicare 
and Social Security on the chopping 
block. He has argued that the benefits, 
which millions of Americans rely on 
every day, shouldn’t be guaranteed but 
should be subject to partisan infighting 
here in Washington. 
He would like to revoke the guar-
antee of Medicare and Social Security 
and make them discretionary. Well, 
you know what happens when we make 
things discretionary around here? All 
too often they get cut or even elimi-
nated. We don’t want to do that. But 
the Senator from Wisconsin said we 
should. So senior citizens of America, 
listen loud and clear: Senator JOHNSON 
called for making these programs dis-
cretionary. 
For decades, they have not been. 
They have been programs that when 
you become 65, you get it. It is not up 
to the whims of one Congress or an-
other. 
So we will fight as hard as we can to 
prevent the Republicans, led by the 
Wisconsin junior Senator, from pulling 
out the rug from under seniors. We will 
fight the MAGA Republican politicians 
who want to gut these critical pro-
grams. 
It is comments like these that show 
how out of touch the other side has be-
come. While Republicans were per-
fectly willing to blow a $2 trillion hole 
in our deficit in order to give tax cuts 
to the ultrarich and to the big corpora-
tions, now some of them are saying 
Medicare and Social Security should 
no longer be guaranteed. 
Of course, our Democratic proposal, 
the Inflation Reduction Act, is vastly 
different. We will protect healthcare. 
We will lower the price of prescription 
drugs and make energy cheaper while 
making the largest investment in clean 
energy ever. 
These are things that Americans sup-
port. These are things that our country 
needs. And these are things that we are 
going to get done when we pass the In-
flation Reduction Act in the coming 
days. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3875 
August 3, 2022 
Eastern Kentucky. In the last few days, 
I have spoken to State legislators and 
county judge-executives who represent 
our hardest hit counties. 
The Governor reports that Knott 
County has seen the largest loss of life 
so far. County Judge Dobson tells me 
the toll may keep rising in the coming 
days. 
State Representative Chris Fugate 
represents 
Breathitt, 
Owsley, 
and 
Perry Counties. He tells me he is hous-
ing about 85 people in his church. And 
the need for shelter for displaced resi-
dents will only grow. 
State Senator Johnnie Turner rep-
resents five counties, including Knott 
and Letcher. He plans to use his own 
equipment to help clear debris from 
the roads. 
All across Eastern Kentucky, emer-
gency crews are making a herculean ef-
fort to restore access to power, roads, 
and running water. The Kentucky Na-
tional Guard has been on the ground 
and in the air since the outset of this 
emergency, performing breathtaking 
rescues and rendering aid. 
Some of their amazing work was cap-
tured on video. Residents stranded on 
the roofs of submerged houses were 
pulled hundreds of feet into the air on 
a cable and into a helicopter—just ex-
traordinary work. 
I am deeply grateful for the brave 
men and women of the Kentucky Na-
tional Guard and their service to our 
State. 
As professional first responders work 
around the clock, families, friends, and 
neighbors are stepping up as well. One 
man’s actions have attracted national 
attention. On Thursday, an anonymous 
neighbor helped a family of three es-
cape their flooded home. Video footage 
showed a 98-year-old grandmother sit-
ting on a bed fully submerged in water. 
This anonymous rescuer whisked that 
woman, her son, and her grandson to 
safety. All three are now recovering. 
Federal, State, and local officials 
will continue to do everything possible 
and coordinate rescue and relief ef-
forts. All these courageous acts from 
professionals and ordinary Kentuck-
ians alike will continue to provide a 
hopeful glimmer of humanity in this 
dark, dark disaster. 
f 
NATO 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on an entirely different matter today, 
the Senate will approve ratification 
protocols to welcome Finland and Swe-
den as the two newest members of 
NATO. 
I appreciate Leader SCHUMER work-
ing with me to ensure the Senate takes 
this vote before the August recess. And 
for the reasons I have explained for 
months now, the vote this afternoon 
will be as decisive—as decisive—as it is 
bipartisan. 
There is just no question that admit-
ting these robust democratic countries, 
with modern economies and capable, 
interoperable 
militaries, 
will 
only 
strengthen the most successful mili-
tary alive in human history. 
Both countries already participate in 
NATO and American-led missions. Fin-
land already meets NATO’s 2 percent 
spending target, and Sweden is making 
significant investments in modernizing 
its military. 
Even with the capabilities these mili-
taries already have, they will bring 
meaningful, interoperable military ca-
pabilities into the alliance on day 1 and 
improve burden-sharing across the alli-
ance. 
There is also no question that their 
entry is specifically in our interest. 
These are longstanding defense part-
ners of the United States. The Finns 
have been flying F–18s and buying so-
phisticated American munitions since 
the 1990s. The Swedish defense industry 
cooperates closely with ours and incor-
porates 
American 
components 
into 
modern systems like their fighter air-
craft. 
Even closer cooperation with these 
partners will help us counter Russia 
and China. Their accession will make 
NATO stronger and America more se-
cure. 
If any Senator is looking for a defen-
sible excuse to vote no, I wish them 
good luck. This is a slam dunk for na-
tional security that deserves unani-
mous bipartisan support. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on one final matter, Democrats want 
to pass huge, job-killing tax hikes in 
the middle of a recession that they 
themselves created—hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in new taxes on Amer-
ican jobs, American manufacturing, 
American electricity, and American in-
vestment. 
Nonpartisan 
experts 
have 
proven 
these tax hikes will break President 
Biden’s promise not to raise taxes on 
the middle class. The working class 
and the middle class will shoulder 
huge—huge—new burdens. 
And all these tax hikes would buy 
American families no relief whatsoever 
from inflation. Nonpartisan experts say 
Democrats’ bill would make inflation 
actually even worse until 2024 and then 
do basically nothing—nothing—to in-
flation thereafter. In the teeth of the 
inflation crisis, Democrats’ bill would 
make inflation even worse over the 
next 2 years. 
Even the most optimistic estimate, 
the best figures for Democrats, say it 
would take their legislation—listen to 
this—9 years—9 years—to unwind as 
much inflation as the country added 
every week in the month of June—9 
years of runaway taxing and spending 
in order to subtract 1 week’s worth of 
inflation. And that is an optimistic 
projection. 
Obviously, the point of this bill is not 
to reduce inflation. Clearly, this tax-
ing-and-spending spree has a different 
purpose. And when you look at the leg-
islation, the real purpose is absolutely 
clear: This bill is a massive goodie bag 
of far-left environmental activists at 
the expense of working families. 
Democrats want to use their own in-
flation as a pretext to dump hundreds 
of billions of dollars into Green New 
Deal nonsense. This bill declares war 
on American energy independence and 
affordability. It will push working fam-
ilies’ bills higher in order to send cash 
kickbacks to rich elites if they buy 
fancy cars and redo their kitchens. 
Democrats literally want to increase 
working families’ gas bill, electricity 
bill, and heating bill so they can send 
rebates to rich people who buy $80,000 
luxury electric cars. 
I am not making this up. They have 
come up with a huge new tax on Amer-
ican natural gas, which millions of 
Americans use to heat their homes, 
cook their food, and dry their clothes. 
On top of that, natural gas is the Na-
tion’s largest source of electricity. So 
Democrats want to add new taxes on 
top of two of the major bills that mil-
lions of American working families pay 
every month. 
That is not all. There is also a new 
per-barrel tax on American oil and new 
royalties and fees to drive up the cost 
of oil and gas production on Federal 
lands. 
With all the money they collect from 
shaking 
down 
American 
families, 
Democrats want to finance new credits 
for people who can afford to buy fancy 
new cars, stoves, and clothes dryers. 
Why? Because that is really ‘‘green’’— 
subsidizing retail therapy for liberal 
elites to rip out working appliances, 
throw them away, and replace them 
with the latest fashions. 
We have the worst inflation in 40 
years right now. Working families can 
barely afford gas and groceries right 
now. And Democrats’ answer is to offer 
them a mail-in rebate if they buy an 
$80,000 car or remodel their kitchen? A 
specific subsidy for electric car buyers 
that the senior Senator from West Vir-
ginia once called ludicrous is in this 
bill which he has now authored. 
Oh, and the bill tries to skirt a Su-
preme Court victory that West Vir-
ginia just won to stop Democrats’ ille-
gal regulations from crushing the 
State’s economy. The legislation inten-
tionally—intentionally—flouts the vic-
tory that people of West Virginia just 
won a few weeks ago at the Supreme 
Court. 
There are billions of dollars for envi-
ronmental and climate justice block 
grants to directly enrich far-left non-
profits, including explicit language 
that would send taxpayer funding to 
political activism. 
Democrats literally want to raise 
your electric bill in order to pay off 
their own protesters. I guess the people 
who stand in the middle of highways 
during rush hour to make some protest 
gesture now want to receive taxpayer 
money for their trouble. Oh—oh—and 
their bill would send billions of dollars 
to the Secretary of Transportation to 
tear up highways instead of building 
more highways.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3876 
August 3, 2022 
If that is not enough, here is the 
kicker. All of this expensive nonsense 
adds up to no—no—meaningful impact 
whatsoever. All of these hundreds of 
billions of dollars to bankroll new ap-
pliances for rich people will not put so 
much as a dent—a dent—in worldwide 
emissions or temperatures. 
The Washington Post admitted on 
Monday this legislation ‘‘can scarcely 
be expected to have an immediate, 
measurable impact on the warming 
planet.’’ 
Huge developing countries like China 
and India are dramatically increasing 
their emissions every year. Even ac-
cording to liberals’ own modeling, this 
bill that is supposedly worth looting— 
looting—the American people would 
have basically no measurable impact 
on global warming whatsoever. 
Liberal waste, subsidies for the rich, 
and, according to their very own mod-
els, no meaningful impact on the cli-
mate—I guess Democrats think their 30 
percent approval rating on the econ-
omy is actually still too high.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, ‘‘You 
don’t want to take money out of the 
economy when the economy is shrink-
ing.’’ ‘‘You don’t want to take money 
out of the economy when the economy 
is shrinking.’’ Those aren’t my words. 
Those were the words of the current 
Democratic leader in 2008: ‘‘You don’t 
want to take money out of the econ-
omy when the economy is shrinking.’’ 
Well, apparently, it is a philosophy 
the Democratic leader no longer sub-
scribes to because, last week, he intro-
duced legislation to take money out of 
the economy when the economy is 
shrinking. 
The Democrats’ so-called Inflation 
Reduction Act—which is a misnomer if 
ever there was one, since the bill will 
do nothing to help alleviate our cur-
rent inflation crisis—will take hun-
dreds of billions of dollars out of the 
economy in the form of new tax hikes 
and comes just as our economy posted 
a second quarter of negative growth. 
Notably, the bill imposes a $313 bil-
lion tax hike on American businesses, 
with roughly half of that increase fall-
ing on American manufacturers. I 
guess the President’s commitment to 
boosting 
American 
manufacturing 
takes a backseat to raising revenue to 
fund Democrats’ Green New Deal prior-
ities. 
I don’t think I need to tell anyone 
what happens when you raise taxes on 
businesses, particularly when the econ-
omy is shrinking. You get less growth, 
fewer jobs, and lower wages. According 
to an analysis from the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers, in 2023 alone, 
the Democrats’ bill would reduce real 
gross domestic product by more than 
$68 billion and result in 218,108 fewer 
workers in the overall economy—a $68 
billion reduction in GDP and more 
than 218,000 fewer workers. 
And ordinary Americans would bear 
a substantial part of the burden of this 
tax increase. According to data from 
the nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Taxation, the Democrats’ bill would in-
crease the tax burden of Americans 
across every income bracket, with 
more than half of the increased tax 
burden falling on Americans making 
$400,000 or less. Next year alone, the 
Democrats’ bill would increase the tax 
burden on Americans earning less than 
$200,000 by $16.7 billion. 
Democrats are brazenly attempting 
to sell this new tax as somehow closing 
a loophole instead of hiking taxes on 
American businesses, but that isn’t 
even close to being the truth. When 
companies pay less than the current 
corporate tax rate, they are often sim-
ply taking advantage of tax credits 
that Republicans and Democrats put in 
place 
to 
encourage 
investment 
in 
things like research and development 
or the production of new technologies. 
Democrats aren’t closing a loophole 
in the tax bill. Let’s face it. They are 
raising taxes on American businesses 
at a time when our economy has posted 
two consecutive quarters of negative 
growth. They are raising taxes on busi-
nesses that are already struggling with 
historically high inflation. 
Democrats claim they will make 
large companies pay at least a 15-per-
cent minimum tax, but that isn’t true 
either because Democrats have created 
carve-outs to their own minimum tax. 
That is right. Not all companies will 
have to pay the new book minimum 
tax. For instance, green energy compa-
nies and companies that take green en-
ergy tax credits will be allowed to pay 
less than the Democrats’ alternative 
minimum corporate tax rate. In other 
words, if you are a member of or invest 
in the Democrats’ preferred industries, 
you get special tax treatment under 
their legislation. So much for ensuring 
that all companies—all companies— 
‘‘pay their fair share.’’ 
In addition to their $313 billion tax 
hike on American businesses, Demo-
crats’ legislation also raises taxes on 
investment—another bad idea at a time 
when our economy is already shrink-
ing. Perhaps Democrats’ real plan is to 
reduce inflation by slowing our econ-
omy and ensuring that we enter a re-
cession or what is known as stagfla-
tion. 
Democrats’ legislation also raises 
taxes on oil and gas production even as 
Americans continue to struggle with 
high energy prices, including a 75-per-
cent increase in gas prices since Presi-
dent Biden took office. 
Taxes aren’t the only way the Demo-
crats raise revenue in this bill to pay 
for their Green New Deal measures. 
The Democrats’ bill also attempts to 
raise revenue by increasing IRS audits 
and enforcement. The Democrats’ leg-
islation gives the IRS an additional $80 
billion in funding over 10 years—$80 bil-
lion, about six times their annual 
budget. This would allow the IRS to 
hire an additional 87,000 employees, 
meaning that the IRS would have near-
ly—do you believe this?—three times 
as many personnel as U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection, the Agency that is 
charged with overseeing security at 
our Nation’s borders—87,000 new em-
ployees. The IRS’s budget would also 
substantially exceed Customs and Bor-
der Protection’s budget if this legisla-
tion is enacted. 
Now, you might think that given the 
raging crisis at our southern border, 
the Biden administration would be fo-
cused on beefing up funding and per-
sonnel for Customs and Border Protec-
tion instead of the IRS, but you would 
be wrong. Apparently, the need to find 
money for Democrats’ Green New Deal 
trumps the need for a secure border. 
Of the additional $80 billion the 
Democrats’ bill would hand to the IRS, 
57 percent or more than $45 billion 
would go to enforcement and only 4 
percent to taxpayer services. Think 
about that. Four percent for an Agen-
cy, as I said on the floor yesterday, 
that only succeeded in answering about 
1 out of every 50 taxpayer phone calls 
during the 2021 tax season and has re-
peatedly, as we all know, mishandled 
sensitive taxpayer data. 
To name just one instance, confiden-
tial taxpayer information was either 
leaked or hacked from the IRS last 
year and shared with the left-leaning 
ProPublica in order to advance a par-
tisan agenda. More than a year later, 
the IRS still hasn’t provided meaning-
ful followup to Congress or account-
ability to taxpayers for that leak. Yet 
Democrats’ focus is not on improving 
the IRS responsiveness and account-
ability but on boosting the number of 
audits. 
Speaking of those audits, no one 
should think the IRS would be just au-
diting major corporations and billion-
aires. No, this bill would result in a lot 
of audits of small businesses and ordi-
nary Americans. In fact, it is ex-
tremely unlikely the Democrats will be

able to gather the revenue they are 
claiming they can get from increased 
IRS enforcement unless they audit 
Americans making less than $200,000 a 
year. 
Based on data, again, from the Joint 
Committee on Taxation, 78 to 90 per-
cent of the revenue projected to be 
raised 
from 
underreported 
income 
would likely come from those making 
under $200,000. Only 4 to 9 percent 
would come from those making more 
than $500,000. That, again, is from the 
Joint Committee on Taxation. 
I just want to repeat that. Seventy- 
eight to ninety percent of the revenue 
projected to be raised from under-
reported income would likely come 
from those making under $200,000 a 
year. In other words, all this talk 
about audits and, you know, closing 
the tax gap and forcing people to pay 
taxes that are due that they are not 
paying today and implying that some-
how that is all going to apply to high- 
income taxpayers or big corporations 
or big businesses is just flat incon-
sistent with the data and the facts as 
compiled by the Joint Committee on 
Taxation. Up to 90 percent of the rev-
enue projected to be raised from under-
reported income would come from 
those making less than $200,000 a year. 
So, Mr. and Mrs. American Taxpayer, 
get ready. Get ready for the IRS en-
forcement auditor to come to your 
house and to start harassing you so 
that the Democrats can pay for their 
massive tax-and-spending spree. 
After more than a year of high infla-
tion spurred by Democrats’ reckless 
American Rescue Plan spending spree 
passed last year and with an economy 
that has shrunk for the past two quar-
ters, it is hard to believe the Demo-
crats are trying to pass hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in tax hikes, but that is 
exactly what is happening. Once again, 
economic common sense is taking a 
back seat to Democrats’ big spending 
and big government ideology. 
Democrats have already inflicted a 
lot of economic pain on the American 
people, and if this legislation passes, 
there is more to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, today, I 
come to the floor to urge President 
Biden to turn his attention to his dis-
astrous withdrawal from Afghanistan 1 
year ago. I want to direct the Com-
mander in Chief to reflect on a series of 
commitments he made to the Amer-
ican people before and during his reck-
less exit. 
On August 19, 2021, President Biden 
promised U.S. troops would remain on 
the ground until every American who 
wanted to leave Afghanistan was evac-
uated. 
On August 26, 2021, President Biden 
promised to hunt down and avenge the 
deaths of 13 servicemembers killed in 
action by ISIS-K in Kabul. 
In a speech to the United Nations on 
September 21, 2021, the President prom-
ised his administration would hold the 
Taliban accountable to protect the 
rights of Afghan women. 
The Commander in Chief failed to up-
hold his word on all three fronts, and 
American security and prosperity have 
suffered as a result of his broken prom-
ises. 
Today in Afghanistan, Americans 
who want to come home remain left be-
hind, and the administration’s lack of 
transparency concerning both the num-
ber and desire of Americans trapped in 
Taliban-controlled 
Afghanistan 
is 
alarming. 
The President and members of his 
Cabinet repeatedly claimed that the 
number of Americans who wanted out 
of Afghanistan was roughly 100. That 
number was spouted from September 
2021 through the beginning of this 
year—the same number over and over 
again—even though we would hear re-
ports on the television that 40 more 
Americans were out, 200 Americans 
were out, and yet the number remained 
the same. How many Americans re-
main in Afghanistan? The number they 
kept using was 100. 
There is no way around it: President 
Biden broke his promise to the Ameri-
cans who remain and their families 
anxiously awaiting their return. 
Americans have lived and traveled 
abroad with assurances that the United 
States would come to their aid in the 
event of a conflict. No matter how far 
away, the United States is expected to 
have the backs of its citizens. Our 
withdrawal from Afghanistan was a 
cut-and-run 
approach 
that 
greatly 
damaged that guarantee. 
If the world’s greatest superpower 
cannot locate and extract its own citi-
zens from the clutches of seventh-cen-
tury thugs, then far greater tests of 
our sovereignty, security, and pros-
perity will only loom larger. 
As we approach the anniversary of 
the haphazard withdrawal, there is an 
open wound hurting our ability to 
deter the actions of our adversaries. 
President Biden promised vengeance 
on the terrorists who killed 13 Ameri-
cans—including 1 from my hometown 
of Red Oak, IA—at Hamid Karzai Inter-
national Airport. 
He told the American people: 
The United States will never rest. We will 
not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt 
you down to the ends of the Earth, and we 
will—you will pay the ultimate price. 
Again, the Commander in Chief’s 
rhetoric does not match his actions. 
The U.S. military has not targeted or 
conducted 
any 
counterterrorism 
strikes against ISIS-K in Afghanistan 
since America’s withdrawal on August 
31, 2021. Those who planned the cow-
ardly act remain at large. 
It is not like ISIS-K is holed up in 
the Hindu Kush mountains, away from 
population centers. At least 26 ter-
rorist attacks, many of which ISIS-K 
has claimed responsibility for, have 
struck the Afghan people in metropoli-
tan Kabul since our withdrawal. Our 
enemies are not hiding, but far too 
often, America is. 
We are also stuck with a largely un-
realized over-the-horizon counterter-
rorism strategy that has not deterred 
the resurgence of terrorists or avenged 
our lost warriors. 
Our military and covert operators’ 
recent strike was welcome and long 
overdue, but the strike demonstrates a 
capability rarely employed and a pos-
ture toward terrorism far too inexact. 
It was President Biden, after all, who 
said last August that al-Qaida was 
gone from Afghanistan. Folks, that is 
clearly not the case. Ensuring that al- 
Qaida leader al-Zawahiri will never 
harm an American again was a nec-
essary action, but the strike has raised 
serious questions about the security 
situation we have in Afghanistan. The 
President’s so-called and much-prom-
ised over-the-horizon counterterrorism 
strategy has not been a deterrent, like 
it was promised to be. Instead, we are 
seeing a growing threat emanating 
from Afghanistan. 
This is the first U.S. military strike 
in Afghanistan since America left on 
August 31 of last year. In the mean-
time, ISIS-K fighters are flowing into 
the country at alarming rates while al- 
Qaida and the Taliban have clearly 
been working together for the past 
year. At the very least, the Taliban 
and Haqqani Network gave al-Zawahiri 
and 
his 
thugs 
safe 
haven, 
dem-
onstrating ongoing Taliban collusion 
with terrorists. A lone strike does not 
demonstrate a developed capacity to 
prevent 
further 
coordination 
that 
threatens American security. 
Not only has the U.S. capacity to 
protect the homeland been greatly 
damaged, the President’s intent to 
champion human rights as a center-
piece of this administration’s foreign 
policy is also in shambles. 
Last fall, the President repeatedly 
claimed Afghan women were a linchpin 
of his foreign policy priorities in the 
region. Yet, today, after 20 years of 
constitutional democracy and advance-
ment of civil rights, the Taliban has 
unraveled significant hard-won gains 
for the women of Afghanistan. The 
Taliban enforce a fundamentalist in-
terpretation of Islam, prohibit women 
from working, from attending sec-
ondary school, and from traveling any 
distance without being accompanied by 
a male member of their family. Most 
recently, the Taliban has required all 
women to cover themselves from head 
to toe in the burqa. Yet it is reported 
that the President’s team continues to 
bargain with the Taliban concerning 
diplomatic recognition, potential co-
ordination with the U.S. intelligence 
community, and access to $3.5 billion 
in held currency to the Taliban, despite 
these actions. 
Extending official diplomatic engage-
ment and facilitating access to funding 
without guaranteed and meaningful 
liberties for women and girls will le-
gitimize the Taliban rule and further

subject women to a brutal regime. Any 
further effort to surrender leverage to 
the Taliban is a candid reflection of 
the Biden administration’s failure to 
remedy its own hypocrisy regarding 
human rights. 
The administration’s abandonment of 
Americans, inability to serve justice 
for our soldiers killed in action, impas-
sive counterterrorism operations, and 
ignorance of the human rights disaster 
they precipitated in Afghanistan have 
substituted sound strategy for an ad 
hoc response of willful negligence. 
And they know it. 
The Department of State and Depart-
ment of Defense under President Biden 
have refused to cooperate with the Spe-
cial Inspector General for Afghanistan 
Reconstruction. 
The President’s neglect is most pro-
foundly demonstrated through his ad-
ministration’s lack of controls on bil-
lions of dollars of taxpayer and frozen 
funds marked for humanitarian aid 
that have found their way into the 
Taliban’s coffers. 
Since the Taliban and Haqqani Net-
work—the two groups that are ruling 
Afghanistan—are Specially Designated 
Global Terrorists, existing law compels 
the administration to disclose the risk 
of taxpayer money slipping into the 
hands of these two terror groups. 
The licenses issued by the Treasury 
Department over the last year extend 
far beyond acute humanitarian aid for 
food and medicine. They expand the au-
thorization of funding for activities 
from endangered species research to di-
rect payments to support governing in-
stitutions controlled by the Taliban 
and the Haqqani Network. 
I led 15 other Senators in asking the 
Biden administration to detail the 
total financial support provided to Af-
ghanistan and an honest assessment of 
the taxes, the fees, and the import du-
ties syphoned off by the Taliban. More 
than 6 months later, we are still wait-
ing for a comprehensive answer. 
This is completely unacceptable in 
light of recent reporting that Taliban 
authorities are interfering with the de-
livery of humanitarian aid, despite a 
pledge to the United Nations last fall 
that they would not. The people of Af-
ghanistan continue to suffer from food 
insecurity while the Taliban are enjoy-
ing the spoils of America’s generosity. 
Numerous requests for a detailed ac-
counting have gone unanswered by the 
Treasury and State Departments. 
Leaving Americans behind, failing to 
avenge the death of 13 servicemembers, 
and abdicating your promises to Af-
ghan women and girls do not deter 
threats from our shores. 
In testimony to the Senate Armed 
Services Committee on October 26, 
2021, the Under Secretary of Defense 
for Policy stated that ISIS-K and al- 
Qaida have the intent to conduct oper-
ations against the United States, and 
that ISIS-K could generate that capa-
bility in 6 to 12 months and al-Qaida 
within 1 to 2 years. 
Eight months have come and passed, 
and we have yet to learn how Team 
Biden will protect our citizens from 
this threat at home or abroad. In the 
absence of such a framework, threats 
to our national security grow every 
day, risking the lives of Americans at 
home and abroad. 
Folks, we are rapidly approaching 
that 1-year mark—the haphazard with-
drawal from Afghanistan—and we can-
not forget. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
TRIBUTE TO JOE SHULTZ 
Ms. 
STABENOW. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I rise to pay tribute to my long-
time Agriculture, Nutrition, and For-
estry Committee staff director and 
dear friend Joe Schultz, who will soon 
be taking on a new challenge after 
more than 15 years of service in the 
U.S. Senate. 
Now, the first thing I have to say 
about Joe, just to get it out of the way, 
is that he is a proud Ohio native and a 
graduate of the Ohio State University, 
which is an immediate challenge for 
anyone from Michigan, whether you 
are a University of Michigan grad or, 
as I am, a Michigan State University 
grad. In fact, his first job in the Senate 
was working for my colleague and 
friend Senator BROWN of Ohio. 
Senator BROWN swears that Joe was 6 
feet 2 inches and had hair when he 
worked for him, and said it is all about 
the farm bills that somehow changed 
that. 
But somehow I convinced Joe to 
come and work for me on the Agri-
culture Committee, in part, by assur-
ing Senator BROWN that Joe would still 
be working for Ohio because Senator 
BROWN is on the Ag Committee. And I 
am so glad and lucky that I was able to 
do that. 
Joe started as our chief economist. 
He is a great numbers guy, and nobody 
loves spreadsheets as much as Joe. Of 
course, he is so much more than a 
numbers guy, though, and we very 
quickly found that out. 
He always knows every part of farm 
policy, and he is an amazing people 
person—someone you definitely want 
on your team when you go into a farm 
bill 
negotiation, 
which 
have 
been 
known to be tough. 
Joe instinctively knows what peo-
ple’s reactions will be, what they will 
need in order to get an agreement, and 
he has always had his finger on the 
pulse of the Agriculture Committee 
and the community. That is, in large 
part, because agricultural is way more 
than a job for Joe; it is his life. 
He grew up on a farm, a family farm 
in Ohio. He even convinced his wife 
Virginia to have their wedding on the 
family farm. It was beautiful, and I was 
so honored to be in attendance with all 
their family and friends and their 
sheep. 
Now, if you have ever talked with 
Joe, you would probably know that his 
family raised sheep on the farm. And, 
boy, can he tell you some wild stories. 
For years, Joe would have a contest 
on Facebook during lambing season. He 
called it ‘‘Lambageddon.’’ His friends 
would all guess the number of lambs 
that would be born over Presidents Day 
weekend, typically the busiest lambing 
weekend of the year. And, of course, he 
always took time off to be there. Who-
ever got closest to the correct number 
of lambs got bragging rights and the 
opportunity to name a lamb. 
Given his dedication to the family 
flock, nobody on the Ag Committee 
was at all surprised when Joe and Vir-
ginia welcomed two adorable babies, 
Will and Izzy, into their own family— 
twins—a little bit more than a year 
ago. After all, sheep typically have 
twin births, I understand. 
If you have ever worked with Joe, 
one of the first things you notice is his 
wonderful 
positive 
attitude. 
He 
is 
quick to smile, quick to laugh. He al-
ways assumes the best of people. He 
makes everything he is involved in so 
much better. That is true whether you 
are talking about very contentious 
farm bill negotiations—and we have 
had more than a few since 2011—or field 
hearings and meetings with stake-
holders. 
I wonder if he has kept a running 
total of the number of farms he has vis-
ited in Michigan. 
Nobody—and I mean nobody—can 
talk about crop insurance like Joe. He 
knows all the details. 
I will never forget, Brandon Fewins, 
who worked for me for 20 years as my 
Northern Michigan regional manager, 
and is now the USDA Rural Develop-
ment Michigan State Director. Bran-
don told this story about seeing this 
firsthand: He remembered a farm bill 
hearing during which one attendee 
asked a very technical question about 
regulations. Joe gave a very detailed 
answer and then said: Hold on. He then 
consulted the farm bill legislative text 
in front of him, found the applicable 
section, and repeated word for word 
what he had just said off the top of his 
head. 
And then there were the codels. I will 
never forget the trip to Africa in 2014 
with the women Members of the Sen-
ate. I led this first all-women’s codel 
and members of the Agriculture Com-
mittee. We went to five countries on 
two continents in 10 days, and many of 
our stops were in very rural areas. 
The codel focused on food security, 
global hunger, empowering women and 
girls, and agricultural trade. 
Having Joe along was such a huge 
help—help because of his broad knowl-
edge of agricultural issues. And, I have 
to say, he is an amazing travel guide. I 
know every Senator on the trip would 
agree with me, and we are so glad that 
he was a part of the trip. 
One thing I am extremely proud of, 
and I know Joe is too, is the strong 
sense of collegiality he has nurtured 
with our amazing Agriculture Com-
mittee staff and beyond. 
As one former colleague said: Joe is 
the kind of leader who makes working 
long hours under crazy stress tolerable 
and survivable.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
PROTOCOLS TO THE NORTH AT-
LANTIC TREATY OF 1949 ON THE 
ACCESSION 
OF 
THE 
REPUBLIC 
OF FINLAND AND THE KINGDOM 
OF SWEDEN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
now proceed to executive session to 
consider Calendar No. 5, Treaty docu-
ment No. 117–3, with all remaining pro-
visions of the previous order in effect. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Under the previous order, the Senate 
will proceed to executive session to 
consider the following: a treaty, which 
the clerk will state. 
The treaty will be stated. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Treaty document No. 117–3, Protocols to 
the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Ac-
cession of the Republic of Finland and the 
Kingdom of Sweden. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 3 
hours of debate, equally divided be-
tween the two leaders or their des-
ignees, on the treaties and resolution 
of advice and consent to ratification. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ. 
Mr. 
President, 
while I know the Senate and the Amer-
ican people’s attention has been drawn 
in many different directions over the 
past couple of months, and while we 
are still working through numerous 
legislative proposals to address real 
challenges that families across the 
United States are facing, from high 
food prices to gas prices to devastating 
natural disasters exacerbated by cli-
mate change, I am here today to en-
courage my colleagues to support the 
United States taking an important 
step forward in affirming our commit-
ment to freedom, democracy, and col-
lective defense; to send a signal to the 
world that we will unite against those 
actors who seek to destabilize the sup-
ply of food that threatens hunger for 
millions of people all over the world, 
who seek to weaponize energy in the 
middle of an unprecedented heat wave, 
and who think they can simply invade 
a neighbor with no consequences. 
As we grapple with the complex geo-
politics, Putin’s generals are bombing 
Ukrainian cities. His forces are still 
largely blockading Ukrainian ports. 
His 
soldiers 
are 
committing 
war 
crimes. These are not only attacks on 
brave Ukrainians, they are attacks on 
the rule of international law of which 
we all want to live by. They are at-
tacks on the international order. They 
are attacks on one of the most deeply 
held American principles of a nation’s 
right to determine its own destiny. 
And so, I rise today in support of 
strengthening one of the greatest tools 
the United States has to bolster our ef-
forts to protect those very democratic 
values and our citizens: the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization, known as 
NATO, one of the greatest alliances the 
world has ever seen. Welcoming Swe-
den and Finland into the NATO alli-
ance will signal the United States’ on-
going commitment to peace, stability, 
and democracy in Europe and around 
the world. 
Enlarging NATO is exactly the oppo-
site of what Putin envisioned when he 
ordered his tanks to invade Ukraine. 
Indeed, he may have been trying to 
test the resolve of the alliance. And I 
am pleased that we have passed that 
test with overwhelming unity of vision 
and purpose. 
He hoped to quickly gobble up terri-
tory to correct what he has called ‘‘the 
greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 
century,’’ which, in essence, is the dis-
solution of what was the Soviet Union 
with little resistance from the coun-
tries who formally united in a values- 
based front against the ills of that vi-
sion for Europe and for the world. But 
instead of a quick strike, Ukrainians— 
from soldiers to schoolteachers—brave-
ly fought back. 
Instead of a Russian coup in Kyiv, 
President Zelenskyy rallied his nation. 
Instead of a divided West, we have been 
more united than ever. The United 
States, the overwhelming majority of 
Europe, and, indeed, the entire free 
world have come together to support 
Ukraine, to support democracies and 
the rule of law, and to defend against 
brazen authoritarian aggression world-
wide. 
However, 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
Putin’s distorted world view has run 
into the reality of a reenergized North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, this has 
not dissuaded him. This has not tem-
pered his resentment of the West. This 
has not stopped him from using food 
and gas as a weapon of war. This has 
not curbed the threat of further Rus-
sian aggression. And so it is absolutely 
critical that we take this historic step 
today and provide our advice and con-
sent to ratifying the accession proto-
cols for Sweden and Finland to join the 
NATO alliance. 
More than ever, it is crystal clear 
that NATO plays a vital role for the se-
curity of the United States and as a 
bulwark in protecting peace and de-
mocracies throughout the world. 
Seventy years ago, democratic na-
tions of Europe and the United States 
came together to defend the liberty, 
freedom, and individual rights of their 
citizens from the threat of a milita-
rized Soviet Union. Now, as then, this 
defensive alliance serves as a bulwark 
of stability and the rule of law for the 
people of its member states. Partnering 
with our values-based partners serves 
as a force multiplier for our defensive 
military capabilities to protect our 
citizens and advance our interests. 
Indeed, the most famous of the arti-
cles of incorporation of NATO, article 
5, which states that an attack on one 
member is considered an attack on all, 
has been invoked only once—only 
once—when terrorists attacked the 
United States on September 11 and our 
NATO allies rallied behind us. The Ca-
nadian Air Force was patrolling our 
skies, and NATO joined us in our col-
lective efforts abroad to hunt down 
those who had perpetrated the attacks 
of September 11. We should do nothing 
in ratification to suggest that we are 
not committed to article 5. 
The U.S. Constitution reigns supreme 
in all of our actions, so we should not 
so doubt about our commitment, espe-
cially in this time in history. So we are 
dutybound to carefully consider who 
we admit into this alliance. 
Over the course of its seven-decade 
history, admission to NATO has been 
guided by the alliance’s open-door pol-
icy, as outlined in article 10 of NATO’s 
founding document, and specific bench-
marks that every American adminis-
tration has used since the founding of 
NATO: Members must have a func-
tioning democratic political system 
based on a market economy; fair treat-
ment of minority populations; a com-
mitment to resolve conflicts peace-
fully; an ability and willingness to con-
tribute to NATO military operations; 
and a commitment to democratic civil- 
military relations. 
Sweden and Finland meet and exceed 
these benchmarks in every respect. In-
deed, the qualifications of these two 
prosperous, democratic 
nations 
are 
outstanding and will serve to strength-
en the NATO alliance. These are two 
steadfast NATO and U.S. allies with 
strong military and democratic insti-
tutions. They have every reason to par-
ticipate in collective defense against 
potential 
Russian 
aggression, 
and 
NATO has every reason to embrace and 
welcome them into the alliance with-
out delay. 
The people of Sweden and Finland 
and their governments have shown 
themselves to be strongly supportive of 
joining NATO, and in many ways, Fin-
land and Sweden are ideal candidates 
for NATO membership. Both have 
large, technologically advanced, and 
growing militaries that are well-posi-
tioned to integrate into NATO. Both 
have partnered with NATO, contrib-
uting to operations in the Balkans, Af-
ghanistan, and Iraq. And since Russia’s

invasion 
of 
Ukraine, 
they 
have 
strengthened 
their 
relations 
with 
NATO even further. They have been en-
gaging in dialogue and consultations. 
They have been exchanging informa-
tion, and they have been coordinating 
training and exercises. 
In fact, given geography and history, 
Finland 
and 
Sweden 
have 
long 
equipped their militaries and prepared 
their societies for the prospect of Rus-
sian aggression. Their participation in 
NATO would reduce the burden on the 
United States and the whole military 
alliance. Finland already spends more 
than 2 percent of its GDP on its defense 
budget, and Sweden has repeatedly 
publicly committed to reaching that 
target as soon as possible. On top of all 
of this, these are two nations that are 
models of good governance—two na-
tions that respect and promote human 
rights. 
With just a few detractors, I am 
pleased that there will be broad bipar-
tisan support for admitting Sweden 
and Finland into NATO, but let me 
speak to those few detractors. 
Some critics say they don’t want us 
to subsidize these wealthy European 
nations’ security, but, of course, that is 
not the case. They meet or will soon 
meet the 2-percent threshold for mili-
tary spending. We can count on these 
nations to pull their own weight. If 
anything, welcoming Finland and Swe-
den to NATO will reduce the burden on 
the United States. There is a tremen-
dous urgency and a strong case for in-
viting these countries, and we must act 
now. 
For those who say that expanding 
NATO provokes Russia, I would say, 
after the decades of neutrality that 
Finland and Sweden have had, they 
have been provoked by Russia’s aggres-
sions in Ukraine to seek NATO mem-
bership. 
Should we let ruthless autocrats 
threaten the security of democratic na-
tions and American allies or let them 
think they can launch ground inva-
sions against peaceful neighbors with-
out consequences? No. 
Should we let the fears of an irra-
tional dictator guide U.S. foreign pol-
icy? No. 
Should we appease a brutal butcher 
like Putin? No. 
The European public says no; the 
American public says no; and I hope 
the U.S. Senate says no as well. 
So, today, I urge my colleagues to 
vote yes—yes to providing advice and 
consent; yes to supporting these his-
toric treaties; yes to welcoming Fin-
land and Sweden—steadfast, loyal al-
lies and beacons of democracy—to 
NATO; yes to a Europe that is secure 
and prosperous. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4723 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, in the 
month since the Supreme Court struck 
down Roe v. Wade, the assault on re-
productive rights by anti-choice MAGA 
Republicans—well, it has been relent-
less. 
We have seen and heard the horror 
stories of women in States that have 
outlawed 
abortion. 
We 
have 
seen 
women and even young girls—children 
as young as 10—who were raped and un-
able to get an abortion in their own 
States. We have seen examples of 
States looking to restrict—restrict—a 
woman’s ability to travel to other 
States—restrict a woman’s ability to 
travel to other States—to get the med-
ical care, the often lifesaving care, 
they desperately need. In fact, this is 
an issue that Republicans in this 
Chamber objected to when Democrats 
brought up a bill to guarantee the fun-
damental right of women to travel in 
this country in order to seek care. 
MAGA Republicans—oh, wait. They 
want to strip women of their freedoms, 
and they want to strip women of their 
ability to choose what happens to their 
own bodies. If MAGA extremists have 
their way in Congress, they will enact 
a rigid—a rigid—nationwide abortion 
ban which will threaten women and 
their doctors with jail time. 
Look at what is already happening: 
Anti-choice States are working to stop 
women from going to pro-choice States 
to seek care, and now they are even 
going after the doctors—after the doc-
tors—in those States, who are simply 
doing their jobs by taking care of their 
patients. 
This is utterly and completely out-
rageous. We cannot allow this to hap-
pen. That is why Senators MURRAY, 
PADILLA, LUJ´AN, and I introduced legis-
lation to protect doctors in States like 
Nevada—where 
abortion 
remains 
legal—from facing prosecution by anti- 
choice States. 
Let me be clear. No doctor should 
ever be jailed for providing women 
with the reproductive and often life-
saving care they need wherever—wher-
ever—those women are from. 
Our bill, the Let Doctors Provide Re-
productive Health Care Act, would do 
exactly what is in the name. It would 
let 
doctors—medical 
professionals— 
provide reproductive care in States 
like Nevada where abortion is legal, 
without fear of prosecution or fear of 
jail time. 
Our bill would empower the Depart-
ment of Justice to protect women and 
their doctors in pro-choice States from 
anti-choice States’ attempts to pros-
ecute them. This means that if a 
woman from Texas travels to my State 
of Nevada, a pro-choice State, the Ne-
vada doctor she sees cannot—cannot— 
be prosecuted under Texas’s extreme 
abortion ban. 
We need to pass this now, without 
delay and without objections, because 
we must protect women, and we must 
protect their doctors. We must pass the 
Let 
Doctors 
Provide 
Reproductive 
Health Care Act now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today in support of the Let Doc-
tors Provide Reproductive Health Care 
Act. 
I am honored to be here with the 
Senator from Nevada, Senator ROSEN. 
She is one of the sponsors of this bill, 
along with Senator MURRAY and Sen-
ator PADILLA, who is also here, and 
Senator BEN RAY LUJA´ N and myself in 
addition to over 20 of our colleagues. 
We must pass this bill today. Almost 
6 weeks ago—that is all the time it has 
been. It seems like it has been a lot 
longer. It has been only 6 weeks since 
the Supreme Court issued a rule shred-
ding nearly five decades of precedent of 
protecting a woman’s right to make 
her own healthcare decisions. 
Now, because of that decision to 
shred 50 years of precedent, women are 
at the mercy of State laws or new 
State laws or Governors. They literally 
ran to the State capitols—a number of 
legislators—to see who could get there 
first to introduce and pass the most ex-
treme bill. Literally, women are at the 
mercy of State laws that are a patch-
work across the country and that, in 
many cases, leave them with fewer 
rights than their mothers or their 
grandmothers had. 
This is in spite of what the American 
people want, as 70 to 80 percent of 
Americans believe that it is a decision 
that should be made by a woman and 
her doctor and not by politicians—not 
by my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle. They don’t want them mak-
ing their decisions for them. They want 
to make their decisions with their doc-
tors. 
As if it were not proof enough, after 
having come here every single week 
since the Dobbs decision was issued to 
remind people of where the actual pub-
lic is out there, look at what happened 
last night. We heard the majority loud 
and clear in the Sunflower State of 
Kansas. The people of Kansas, in a 
record turnout—doubling the number 
of Kansans who voted in the last mid-
term election—voted 59 to 41 percent to 
protect reproductive freedom. That is 
more than 530,000 Kansans who showed 
up at an odd election time. In the mid-
dle of the summer, on a hot day in Au-
gust, they showed up to protect wom-
en’s rights. For context, fewer than 
460,000 Kansans even cast a ballot in 
the 2018 primary. That is what we are 
dealing with; yet we now have 530,000 
who showed up to vote on one side to 
say: A woman’s right should be pro-
tected in their State. 
This is a wake-up call to my col-
leagues who have been resisting action 
when it comes to allowing women to 
travel, when it comes to allowing 
women to be able to make a choice 
about even contraception, when it 
comes to, in this bill, letting doctors 
provide reproductive healthcare. 
This doesn’t come down to red States 
or blue States, my friends. People 
across the country, as I have argued 
vociferously before—and now I have my 
proof point—whether they be Independ-
ents, Democrats, or moderate Repub-
licans, when they show up, women’s

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3881 
August 3, 2022 
rights are protected. And guess what. 
They are showing up. 
Since this decision came down, I have 
come to the floor of the Senate again 
and again with my colleagues to push 
for 
commonsense 
bills 
to 
protect 
women in this post-Roe world. We have 
tried to preserve a woman’s right to 
travel to other States; that was Sen-
ator CORTEZ MASTO’s bill. We brought a 
bill to the floor to give women reliable 
access to family planning services; that 
was my colleague Senator TINA SMITH’s 
bill. We tried to pass legislation to 
make sure everyone could access con-
traception as well as accurate informa-
tion about contraception. 
We thank all our colleagues for their 
work on these bills, and I want to spe-
cifically mention Senator MURRAY for 
her work. We are not giving up, not 
when so much is on the line. 
Many of the biggest fights for repro-
ductive freedom are happening on 
State and local levels. Women as well 
as their doctors are now in the cross-
hairs. Republican State lawmakers are 
drafting legislation that would make it 
a crime to provide abortion care to a 
patient in another State where it is 
legal. 
Let’s get this straight. They would 
make it a crime, where you can’t get 
an abortion—like that little 10-year-old 
girl couldn’t get an abortion, when she 
was raped, in her own State. She goes 
to another State, and now we have leg-
islators in certain States who are try-
ing to make it a crime for her to do 
that. State legislators in Texas and Ar-
kansas have indicated they are consid-
ering these kinds of laws, and the Gov-
ernor of South Dakota, which shares a 
border with my State, refused to rule 
out a similar law. 
Doctors in Minnesota, where repro-
ductive rights are firmly protected, 
could be prosecuted for providing com-
pletely legal medical procedures for 
people in maybe North Dakota or 
South Dakota or Iowa who come to the 
great State of Minnesota. 
The Let Doctors Provide Reproduc-
tive Health Care Act is a straight-
forward solution. It protects doctors 
giving abortion care in States where it 
is legal and stops extreme attempts to 
investigate or punish them for doing 
their job. 
Women and the providers who help 
them are already facing so much uncer-
tainty because of the Dobbs decision. 
We should all be able to agree that, at 
the very least, States shouldn’t be able 
to target, punish, or arrest out-of- 
State doctors who are following their 
own State laws. 
Today, each and every one of my col-
leagues has the opportunity to make 
clear where they stand. They did that 
in Kansas last night; they were able to 
vote. Now, let’s have a real vote on 
this—not stop the vote, actually get it 
done. 
I see my friend Senator BLUMENTHAL, 
who has been such a leader on this 
issue, out of the State of Connecticut 
is here as well as Senator PADILLA. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
first, I thank my colleague and friend 
from the great State of Minnesota for 
being such a steadfast champion of this 
issue over so many years and such an 
articulate and eloquent spokesman. 
I am proud to join her and other col-
leagues, as we have done, week after 
week since the Dobbs decision, trying 
to protect a woman’s right to decide 
when and whether to have children, a 
woman’s basic control over her own 
body, a woman’s freedom that the 
Dobbs decision stripped away and put 
in the hands of politicians. 
The politicians in robes on the Su-
preme Court, in effect, took those 
rights away from the women of Amer-
ica, after 50 years of precedent and 
after everyone thought these rights 
were absolutely secure. 
When I first introduced the Women’s 
Health Protection Act in 2013, the idea 
that Roe v. Wade would be overruled 
was absolutely unimaginable. We were 
trying to fight the disruption of rights 
piece by piece through State laws that 
required admitting privileges or width 
of hallways or waiting times or other 
kinds of restrictions that constituted 
an unconstitutional burden on women’s 
rights. 
Now, we are in the post-Roe world 
where the unthinkable has become 
real. The unimaginable is with us right 
now, and worse is to come. 
The hit list of this Supreme Court in-
cludes contraception, marriage equal-
ity, the basic right to privacy that is 
enshrined in the Constitution, the 
right to be let alone from government 
interference. 
So my Republican colleagues who 
think we are being alarmists, the un-
thinkable is with us right now. And we 
need to provide assurance and cer-
tainty to the women of America that 
they can travel to seek abortion serv-
ices; that family planning options will 
be available to them; that contracep-
tion rights will be secure. And each 
time we have come to the floor to seek 
that recognition of basic rights, the 
Republicans have blocked us. 
So now we are here on a measure 
called let doctors provide reproductive 
healthcare—Let Doctors Provide Re-
productive Health Care. 
There is a really cruel irony to this 
effort. The doctors and nurses and 
healthcare providers who were our 
heros and remain our heros—even more 
so now—during the pandemic and after-
ward, can be prosecuted criminally for 
trying to save a woman’s life. An abor-
tion that is necessary to that woman’s 
life may be the mission of a doctor who 
then can be prosecuted criminally. 
Now, in Connecticut, we have said— 
our legislature has made it absolutely 
clear that nobody in Connecticut is 
going to be prosecuted, no law enforce-
ment official in Connecticut is going to 
cooperate with Texas or any other 
States that criminalize abortion serv-
ices, no evidence from Connecticut is 
going to be made available to an overly 
zealous or aggressive prosecutor hell- 
bent on going after a doctor or a 
healthcare provider or a woman who 
seeks 
abortion 
services, 
but 
Con-
necticut is the exception. Its safe har-
bor makes it unusual, not common. 
So we need a national law, Let Doc-
tors Provide Reproductive Health Care 
Act, 
that 
protects 
the 
healthcare 
givers and providers of our Nation to 
do their job. The Hippocratic oath is, 
for them, something that goes as deep 
as our oath of office for us. We are 
sworn to uphold the Constitution; they, 
in effect, take an oath to save lives. 
That is their job, and their lives should 
not be in jeopardy, nor should their 
livelihood, simply because they are 
doing their job. 
We have seen, time and time again, 
that this Supreme Court has no respect 
for precedent. We have seen State leg-
islators who have no respect for repro-
ductive rights and healthcare. We can-
not rely on false reassurances made by 
Republican colleagues here or anyone 
around the country because history has 
already shown us that this Supreme 
Court has on its hit list these funda-
mental rights and expanding the re-
strictions on them. 
So I ask my colleagues to join us in 
unanimous consent for this measure. 
That motion will be made shortly. I 
hope that we can join in ensuring that 
individuals have access to quality 
healthcare regardless of their ZIP 
Code, no matter where they live. The 
women of America deserve this basic 
right, and the healthcare providers who 
enable them to protect themselves and 
who save lives deserve the assurance 
that they are not going to be the target 
of a prosecutor hell-bent on making a 
name for himself or a State legislature 
seeking to make political points at the 
expense of a healthcare provider. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, col-
leagues, on January 24, just 51⁄2 weeks 
ago, the Supreme Court overturned 
Roe v. Wade just weeks after Repub-
licans in this Chamber blocked our 
push to codify the right to an abortion 
into Federal law. 
So since January 24, Democrats have 
been fighting to ensure that abortion 
care remains accessible. We pushed to 
pass a bill that would protect the fun-
damental right to travel to States 
where abortion is still legal; Repub-
licans blocked it. We pushed to pass a 
commonsense bill to expand access to 
family planning services; Republicans 
blocked that one too. We pushed to 
codify the right to contraception; Re-
publicans blocked it. At every turn, 
Republicans have taken extreme and 
out-of-touch 
positions 
by 
blocking 
these commonsense bills. 
So today Democrats are standing up 
to protect doctors, nurses, and other 
healthcare professionals who are in-
creasingly under attack just for doing

August 3, 2022 
their jobs and providing legal abor-
tions. 
Colleagues, I am proud to join Sen-
ator MURRAY and our colleagues in this 
effort to pass the Let Doctors Provide 
Reproductive Health Care Act to en-
sure doctors can provide the reproduc-
tive 
healthcare 
that 
women 
need. 
Abortion access, after all, is essential 
healthcare. 
Now, I have seen firsthand the in-
credible work that providers in Cali-
fornia do to provide critical reproduc-
tive care. Most recently, I have visited 
a Planned Parenthood clinic in Los An-
geles. We are already seeing a chilling 
effect among healthcare providers driv-
en by the uncertainty of their legal li-
ability—like the alarming lawsuit that 
was filed against the provider in Indi-
ana who legally helped a 10-year-old 
rape victim terminate her unwanted 
pregnancy. So we must make it clear 
for healthcare providers that abortion 
restrictions cannot be allowed to reach 
beyond the borders of anti-abortion 
States. 
The decision of whether or not to 
have a child is one of the most personal 
decisions that someone can make—for 
the students who choose to finish high 
school before starting a family, for the 
survivors of sexual assault whose abor-
tion reaffirms the right to choose for 
their own bodies, for the parents who 
desperately wanted a child only to 
learn devastating news about dan-
gerous health risks, for patients whose 
lives were saved by an abortion because 
abortion is often critical medical care. 
Access to abortion should not be dic-
tated by politicians and lawyers. 
California and many other States 
across the country refuse to turn the 
clock back to an era when abortions 
were outlawed and dangerous. And, as 
we saw last night in Kansas, the major-
ity of Kansas voters—in fact, the ma-
jority of Americans—agree that women 
should have access to abortion care. 
So we must pass the Let Doctors Pro-
vide Reproductive Healthcare Act to 
protect the courageous women and men 
delivering essential medical care to 
those who need it. 
While Republicans continue to block 
our efforts to protect reproductive 
rights, Democrats won’t back down. In 
the face of these unending attacks on 
reproductive freedom, we will not give 
up the fight to protect a woman’s right 
to safe abortion access. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
want to start by recognizing the over-
whelming victory for the right to abor-
tion in Kansas last night. Since the 
day the Supreme Court struck down 
the right to abortion and upended the 
lives of women across the country, the 
American people have been using their 
voices to speak out against Repub-
licans’ extreme bans. 
And now, for the first time since the 
Dobbs decision, they have had the 
chance to speak with their votes, and 
they sent a message loud and clear: 
People do not want their fundamental 
rights stripped away. They will not for-
get Republicans’ cruelty in dragging us 
back half a century, and when abortion 
is at stake, they are not going to stay 
on the sidelines. 
Last night, the people of Kansas sent 
a message as clear as any I have ever 
seen in politics. Now, today, we are 
going to see if Republicans are finally 
getting that message or if they are 
going to continue to ignore the Amer-
ican people, because Democrats are 
here today with legislation to protect 
doctors providing legal abortion care 
and make sure they can do their jobs, 
practice medicine, and save lives with-
out the threat of legal action. 
I really can’t believe that we need 
this bill at all. We are talking about 
doctors who are following the law and 
simply want to provide care to their 
patients. It is not enough for Repub-
licans that their cruel abortion bans 
have meant appointments that have 
been canceled; prescriptions that have 
been denied; doctors who have been 
forced to wait until patients got sicker, 
to wait until women are actually at 
death’s door before they can provide 
lifesaving care. 
Nope, they are going to go further 
than that. Now they are coming after 
doctors providing legal abortion care 
too. I really can’t emphasize that 
enough. These doctors are following 
the law and are still facing legal 
threats and harassment. 
Right now, in Indiana, a doctor is 
being investigated after providing an 
abortion for a 10-year-old who was 
raped. Think about that. A doctor is 
being investigated after doing their 
job, 
after 
simply 
providing 
healthcare—care that can be lifesaving, 
care that was entirely legal in their 
State, care that, up until the Repub-
licans’ far-right Supreme Court over-
turned Roe, was legal across the coun-
try. 
The fact that Dr. Bernard is being in-
vestigated after just doing her job and 
helping her patient is chilling. 
I want to be very clear. While Dr. 
Bernard’s story may be in headlines 
across the country, she is not the only 
doctor facing threats, and she will not 
be the last. At this very moment, Re-
publican State lawmakers are drafting 
legislation that would make it a crime 
to provide abortion care to a resident 
even in another State where it is legal. 
From talking with doctors back 
home in Washington, I can tell you, 
they are following this closely and 
they are worried. I have heard from 
providers back in Spokane and across 
Washington State who are worried that 
they could face lawsuits that threaten 
their practices and their livelihoods 
just for doing their jobs, just for pro-
viding care that patients need—care 
that is, once again, completely legal in 
my State. 
So Democrats are here today stand-
ing up for doctors. We have been draft-
ing a bill of our own, the Let Doctors 
Provide Reproductive Healthcare Act, 
and we are proud that Dr. Bernard her-
self supports this bill. 
I want to thank my colleagues Sen-
ator 
ROSEN
from 
Nevada, 
Senator 
LUJA´ N from New Mexico, and Senator 
PADILLA from California for their part-
nership and critical work on this bill, 
as well as my colleague Representative 
SCHRIER from my home State of Wash-
ington, who is leading the legislation 
in the House. 
This is another simple bill to address 
a threat we know is far too real. The 
Let 
Doctors 
Provide 
Reproductive 
Healthcare Act will protect doctors 
providing legal abortion care and make 
sure that they can practice medicine 
and save lives without fear of legal 
threats and intimidation. It will make 
clear that the attacks we have seen on 
doctors are unacceptable; that politi-
cians should not be harassing or scar-
ing or investigating or threatening or 
punishing doctors for providing care 
that is perfectly legal, that patients 
want, and that, in many cases, is even 
necessary to save lives. 
Democrats are going to try to pass 
this bill right now because we believe 
no doctor should be punished for caring 
for patients and providing legal abor-
tion care. And if Republicans who have 
claimed they don’t want to punish doc-
tors actually mean it, if those words 
are more than just an empty talking 
point, more than another broken prom-
ise, they will stay out of the way and 
let us get this done today. 
But if they don’t—if they block us 
like they blocked the legislation to 
protect the right to travel across State 
lines for an abortion, or like they 
blocked the legislation to expand fam-
ily planning services, or like they 
blocked legislation to protect the right 
to 
contraceptives—their 
obstruction 
will continue to speak louder than any 
of their hollow claims about actually 
caring for patients or families or 
women. 
And even if they stop us from getting 
this bill done today, they are not going 
to stop us from continuing to put them 
on the record and hold them account-
able for their positions. They are not 
going to stop us from doing everything 
we can to protect the rights and the 
people they are putting in grave dan-
ger. And they are going to have to an-
swer to the people they represent—to 
patients, to providers, to families— 
whose lives they are turning upside 
down. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 4723 and that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration; further, 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Indiana.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3883 
August 3, 2022 
Americans are not going to see eye to 
eye on the issue of abortion. I am glad 
to see that the Supreme Court did what 
it did and returned that decision to the 
people, to the State legislatures. Cur-
rently, Indiana is debating that issue. 
This bill denies State legislators the 
right to make laws protecting life in 
their own States. The bill appears to be 
dealing with traveling freely across the 
Nation to get an abortion, but a literal 
reading of the text proves the true in-
tent of the bill. It is, I think, a back-
door into trying to upend what should 
be neighboring State legislatures’ re-
sponsibility. It should be the people in 
their State that make the decision. 
Let’s look at section 3(a)(3) of the 
bill, stating ‘‘no individual, entity, or 
State may restrict . . . a health care 
provider or any individual entity from 
providing or assisting a health care 
provider with reproductive health care 
services for an individual who does not 
reside’’—who does not reside—‘‘in the 
State in which the services are to be 
provided.’’ 
Sections 3(a)(1) and 3(a)(2) of the bill 
specifically include the phrase ‘‘lawful 
in the State.’’ Why is that omitted 
from the previous clause? I think it is 
because this bill is an attempt to un-
dermine State laws that protect life by 
allowing abortions for anyone who 
crosses State lines and is not a resident 
of that State. 
Not to belabor it, I want to read it 
one more time, slowly. Once again, this 
bill reads: 
No individual, entity, or State may pre-
vent, restrict, impede, or disadvantage . . . 
any individual from providing or assisting 
reproductive health care services for an indi-
vidual who does not reside in the State. 
Senator MURRAY
did not mention 
that it also gives the Department of 
Justice $40 million in grant funding to 
help people sue States that enact poli-
cies to protect life. The Department of 
Health and Human Services is given 
another $40 million in funding for any 
eligible center at Secretary Becerra’s 
discretion. This funding is not pro-
tected by the Hyde amendment. 
We should not spend $80 million to 
undermine State laws on life or impose 
a legislative backdoor for abortion on 
demand across the Nation. For this 
reason, I oppose this bill, and I do ob-
ject to it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we 
have now seen time and again, over the 
last few weeks, that when it comes to 
protecting 
rights 
and 
providing 
healthcare for women and patients and 
families, Republicans’ promises are 
empty and their positions are extreme. 
Democrats just offered a bill to pro-
tect the rights of providers to be able 
to provide abortions in legal States. 
Democrats recently offered a bill to 
protect the right to travel across State 
lines to get an abortion. They blocked 
it. We offered a bill to expand our Na-
tion’s longstanding Family Planning 
Program. They blocked that. We of-
fered a bill to protect the right to con-
traceptives, and they blocked that too. 
Today, again, we offered a bill simply 
to protect doctors performing legal 
abortions, and they blocked that too. 
Each one of these bills was incredibly 
straightforward. Each one of these is 
common sense. Each time, Republicans 
have stood in the way of basic protec-
tions of Americans’ reproductive free-
doms. 
Democrats are not giving up, and, as 
we saw last night, the American people 
are not either. We are going to fight for 
the right to an abortion. We are going 
to fight for doctors who are doing their 
jobs and doing what is best for their 
patients. We are going to fight for 
women making their own decisions 
about their own bodies, their families, 
and their futures. 
And we are going to make sure every-
one knows and no one forgets exactly 
who is standing in the way, exactly 
where Republicans stand in this fight. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Who 
yields time? 
If no time is yielded, time will be 
charged equally to both sides. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am on the floor today with Senator 
JEANNE SHAHEEN from New Hampshire 
to join in a colloquy regarding what is 
happening in Ukraine. This is the 20th 
time in so many weeks that I have 
come to the floor to talk about the ille-
gal, unprovoked, and brutal invasion of 
Ukraine by Russia. 
Today, I look forward to being with 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
SHAHEEN, 
a 
member of the Ukraine Caucus and 
someone with whom I have traveled to 
Ukraine and also to the border of 
Ukraine and Poland to meet with the 
refugees. 
Senator SHAHEEN is going to talk, I 
think, a little about how we got to 
where we are and what we do going for-
ward. I was also recently made aware 
of the fact that we are going to take up 
the NATO ratification vote today. And 
this is to have the United States ap-
prove the addition of Sweden and Fin-
land to the NATO alliance. This is 
great for the alliance. It is great for 
the United States. And I believe it is 
also—otherwise, they wouldn’t be in-
terested—very good for the people of 
Finland and Sweden. 
They add a lot to the NATO alliance. 
They are militarily and economically 
in a position to be valuable contribu-
tors. They also, in the case of Finland, 
share the largest land border with Rus-
sia of any country. They have under-
standable concerns with what they see 
happening in Ukraine. 
I just believe it is very much in our 
national security interests and the in-
terests of people I represent to have, in 
addition, even further strengthening of 
the NATO alliance through the addi-
tion of these two partners. 
Vladimir Putin thought he was going 
to split NATO apart when he began his 
invasion of Ukraine, I believe. And 
today, he is finding just the opposite 
has happened. NATO has come together 
in ways we have never seen. And we 
now have, again, the addition of two 
very strong members of NATO who are 
longtime allies of the United States 
and will add significantly to the NATO 
alliance. 
With regard to Ukraine, let’s start 
with a little history. Ukrainians have 
faced adversity from Russia for hun-
dreds of years. This is not new to them. 
Russia’s oppression of Ukraine is not a 
21st century issue. For 300 years, under 
the brutal rule of the Russian czars, 
Ukrainians were subjected to repeated 
efforts to stamp out their language, 
their culture, and their identity. 
In January of 1918, Ukrainians got 
their first taste of national freedom. 
While Russia was dealing with the 
chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution, 
Ukraine 
declared 
its 
independence 
from the Russian Empire. Unfortu-
nately, this freedom was short-lived. 
Just a few years later, the Bolsheviks 
conquered Ukraine and subsumed it 
into the Soviet Union. 
As an unwilling member of the So-
viet Empire, Ukrainians suffered hor-
rific atrocities at the hands of their So-
viet overlords. In 1932 and again in 1933, 
the Stalinist regime confiscated grain 
harvests across Ukraine and imposed a 
premeditated manmade famine against 
the people of Ukraine. This horrific 
atrocity is known as the Holodomor. 
Millions of men, women, and children 
were starved to death in a deliberate 
effort to break the Ukrainian nation’s 
resistance to communist occupation. 
Stalin even ordered the borders of the 
country to be sealed to prevent anyone 
from escaping this manmade starva-
tion and to prevent the delivery of any 
international food aid. 
In 2018, Senator DURBIN and I intro-
duced a resolution to commemorate 
the 85th anniversary of the Holodomor 
and to recognize the Commission on 
the Ukraine Famine’s findings that the 
Holodomor was a genocide—no ques-
tion. 
I am grateful to Senator SHAHEEN, 
Senator TILLIS, and others who are in 
the Chamber today for cosponsoring 
that resolution. It passed in October of 
2018 unanimously here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
The Holodomor failed to extinguish 
the Ukrainian people’s identity, as 
hard as they tried, but it was not the 
end of the Soviet oppression. In the 
1970s, the Soviet leadership imposed a 
crackdown on Ukrainian intellectuals 
and those with any sort of leanings to-
ward independence or toward the West. 
The prisons and gulags became filled 
with Ukrainian political prisoners as 
the Soviet Union once again tried to 
assault Ukrainian identity. 
But then, in 1991, after years of op-
pression, Ukraine finally broke away 
from its Russian rulers for good. 
Ukraine declared its independence on 
August 24 that year, and in December, 
the declaration was confirmed by a ref-
erendum in which over 90 percent of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3884 
August 3, 2022 
the Ukrainian people voted in favor of 
independence. 
This chart shows the amazing re-
sponse of the people of Ukraine to that. 
Ninety-five percent of the people in the 
Kyiv area, as you can see, supported 
independence. 
By the way, Russians often say that 
Crimea really was not part of Ukraine. 
Well, more than half of the people in 
Crimea were for independence as well. 
But Russia’s crimes against the people 
of Ukraine continue to this day. 
Last week, a video was circulated on-
line of a Russian soldier torturing and 
mutilating a Ukrainian prisoner. Un-
fortunately, it is not an isolated inci-
dent. After this, the Ukrainian soldier 
was shot dead and dragged with a rope 
into a shallow grave by his Russian 
captors. 
We have all seen the pictures from 
Bucha—people 
assassinated, 
people 
with their hands tied behind their 
back. Elsewhere in Ukraine, a Russian 
missile attack struck a prison in 
Donetsk that was housing Ukrainian 
prisoners of war. This chart shows that 
prison and the fact that it was at-
tacked by missiles. 
Many of these soldiers were involved 
in the heroic defense of the Azovstal 
steel factory in Mariupol. They held 
out for weeks against Russian assaults 
on the plant. At least 40 Ukrainian 
POWs, maybe more, were killed in this 
assault. These are POWs. These were 
soldiers who were lawful prisoners of 
war, supposedly protected by the Gene-
va Convention. Russia’s murder of 
these POWs is a war crime. And Russia 
must be held accountable for this and 
all its countless crimes in Ukraine. 
But following its usual playbook, 
Russia is spreading massive amounts of 
disinformation regarding this incident 
and so many others. They claim that 
the Ukrainian forces killed these pris-
oners as a way to discourage other sol-
diers from surrendering. 
This, of course, is nonsense. Among 
other things, Ukraine needs the man-
power. Why would they kill their own 
soldiers instead of getting them back 
in a prisoner swap that everybody as-
sumed was going to happen? It makes 
little sense, but it has never stopped 
Russia from propagating lies to deflect 
blame from its own crimes. And, 
unsurprisingly, the Red Cross still has 
not been granted access to the site by 
Russia, which clearly needs more time 
to cover up the evidence of its involve-
ment before they allow any kind of in-
spection. Let the Red Cross in. 
Those responsible for these atrocities 
must be held to account. This is one 
reason why Senator SHAHEEN and I last 
week cosponsored a resolution to rec-
ognize what is happening in Ukraine as 
genocide. 
Across 
the 
country, 
Ukrainian 
women and children have been sub-
jected to indiscriminate Russian mis-
sile strikes and airstrikes. It has killed 
thousands of innocents; not combat-
ants, noncombatants—children. 
A few weeks ago, I spoke about little 
Liza, a 4-year-old girl with autism who 
was killed by a Russian missile strike 
in Vinnytsia. When Ukrainian First 
Lady Olena Zelenska was in town a 
couple of weeks ago, she spoke about a 
3-year-old boy who just learned how to 
use a prosthetic. Imagine that, an in-
nocent 3-year-old boy who has been 
forced to learn how to use a prosthetic 
limb because of a Russian airstrike on 
civilian targets. 
These stories are hard to hear and 
hard to tell, but the world must know 
about them. This is the reality that all 
Ukrainians are facing. Unsurprisingly, 
the people of Ukraine are responding to 
these atrocities. A possible Ukrainian 
counteroffensive may be unfolding in 
the south, in the direction of Kherson. 
We have heard about this in the pop-
ular media. 
Kherson is here. It is near the Black 
Sea Port of Odesa. This southern part 
of Ukraine is incredibly important for 
Ukraine’s economy, and Russia knows 
that. 
Remember, Kherson was the first 
major Ukrainian city to fall to the 
Russian forces after Russia’s full-scale 
invasion began in February of this 
year. But now, Ukrainian soldiers are 
conducting missile strikes against Rus-
sian military infrastructure in the area 
to weaken Russia’s defenses. They are 
also conducting limited ground attacks 
and liberating parts of this territory 
that Russia has illegally taken. You 
can see that in light blue. 
The 
significance 
of 
recapturing 
Kherson cannot be overestimated. It 
would undo one of Russia’s earliest 
successes in the war. It is also impor-
tant that Ukraine regain control of 
much of its Black Sea coast as pos-
sible. This is the Ukrainian economy’s 
primary connection to the rest of the 
world. Russia, of course, has sought to 
capture this coastline in order to eco-
nomically strangle Ukraine. 
We talked last week about what they 
are doing in Odesa. They finally de-
cided they were going to let ships come 
out of Odesa, and they made an agree-
ment that they would not continue to 
bomb Odesa and certainly not bomb 
any port facilities. Within 12 hours, 
they bombed port facilities in Odesa. 
That is how much the Russian commit-
ment meant. But a ship finally has 
sailed from Odesa, and we hope many 
more will go. 
If Ukraine is successful in its efforts 
here in the south, it will undermine 
President Putin and his attempts to 
make a Russian victory in Ukraine, 
something that the Russians say is in-
evitable. 
While Ukraine is making progress in 
the south, Russia is laying the ground-
work to try to annex occupied land, 
particularly in the east, in this area 
near Donetsk. 
Occupation means that the Russians 
themselves are distributing Russian 
passports, paying salaries in Russian 
rubles, and expediting Russian citizens 
for Ukrainian citizens. There are re-
ports that Russia will stage a sham ref-
erendum in this area to try to legiti-
mize their illegal annexation. 
Senior Kremlin officials have warned 
Russia 
will 
never 
leave 
areas 
of 
Kherson, in the south here, where Rus-
sian forces have been occupying the 
territory. Before the invasion, these 
cities were home to more than 2.5 mil-
lion Ukrainians in this area—2.5 mil-
lion Ukrainians. 
One prominent Kremlin propagandist 
said: 
Ukraine as it was cannot continue to exist. 
This person continued. 
There will not be the Ukraine that we have 
known for many years. It won’t be Ukraine 
any longer. 
Clearly, that is the Russian intent. 
Vladimir Putin has said his ambition is 
even more. It is to fully restore the 
borders of the old Soviet Union. We 
must make sure he knows that Ukraine 
in 2022 is not Ukraine of 1921, which the 
Russian 
Bolsheviks 
conquered 
and 
forced into the Soviet empire. 
We know how to help Ukraine to 
keep this from happening. It is to pro-
vide them what they need to defend 
themselves. We have recently provided 
Ukraine with what we call High Mobil-
ity Artillery Systems, or HIMARS. 
Many of us have been advocating for 
that. We are glad to see that there are 
some HIMARS now in the theater. 
These have been critical to the recent 
Ukrainian military successes. 
So this Congress has made a dif-
ference. We provided funding. We have 
gotten some equipment into the area 
that the Ukrainians need to be able to 
defend themselves and to have some 
sort of a level playing field with Rus-
sia’s much bigger Army. 
Officials have said that with the help 
of these HIMARS, Ukraine has taken 
out Russian high-value targets and de-
stroyed them and saved countless 
Ukrainian lives. These include ammu-
nition depots and targets from long 
distances. HIMARS have also con-
ducted many of these strikes in south-
ern Ukraine, I talked about earlier, to 
make progress here in the Kherson 
area. 
Russians have similar long-range ar-
tillery that previously allowed them to 
fire on Ukrainian forces with impunity. 
They could sit back and fire and level 
cities 
and 
kill 
civilians 
and 
kill 
Ukrainian military personnel. But they 
couldn’t be reached by the Ukrainians. 
Now the Ukrainians have taken them-
selves out of that danger zone because 
these HIMARS can balance the playing 
field and have that longer range and 
the accuracy they need. 
I think there are about 15 in theater 
now. There are also a few from Ger-
many and a few from the UK. But they 
need more. They said they need 40 to 50 
and the munitions to be able to make 
them effective. That is something that 
we should be focused on. We should be 
focused on providing them, again, what 
they need to actually win this conflict. 
I believe we also have to continue to 
provide the Ukrainians with other 
weapons as well, including the Army 
Tactical 
Missile 
System, 
or 
the 
ATACMS. This missile, which can be

August 3, 2022 
launched 
from 
the 
same 
HIMARS 
launchers that we have already been 
giving to Ukraine, has a longer range 
of 300 kilometers. 
In a war like this one that is increas-
ingly becoming an artillery duel, range 
is a decisive factor. These missiles 
would allow Ukraine to turn the tables 
on the Russians, whereas Ukraine used 
to be outranged by the Russian artil-
lery. With the ATACMS missiles, we 
would be able to help Ukraine be able 
to strike important Russian targets 
with impunity themselves. 
This is important because Ukraine is 
now using these weapons in this coun-
teroffensive in Kherson. The Institute 
for the Study of War—a think tank 
here in Washington, DC—has said re-
cently this offensive to take out Russia 
is in the works, and Ukrainians are 
using HIMARS to strike targets effec-
tively 50 miles away. It is helping. We 
made a difference. 
Former 
security 
adviser 
to 
the 
Ukrainian 
Government 
Alexander 
Khara told Newsweek the state of Rus-
sian morale in the south means a coun-
teroffensive ‘‘has an excellent chance 
of success.’’ 
He continued. 
The Russians suffer from poor morale, 
logistical 
troubles, 
and 
the 
horror 
of 
HIMARS. 
So the evidence is clear as to why we 
should continue to send them weapons 
they need to be able to not just survive 
but to win this conflict. 
By the way, we have hundreds of 
HIMARS in our stocks that are cur-
rently not with Active units. So we 
have the ability to help more. 
This war has now crossed over the 5- 
month mark. Since before the invasion 
began, I have come to this floor a num-
ber of times to talk about what needs 
to be done, as has Senator SHAHEEN, as 
have others. I have mentioned the fact 
that we sent billions in military aid 
and 
humanitarian 
assistance 
to 
Ukraine and that it is working. Par-
ticularly, as we see with some of these 
new weapons, it is making a difference. 
It will help these brave warriors and 
their most vulnerable noncombatants— 
the kids and the children—be able to 
survive and be able, in the case of the 
military, to be able to start making 
progress to push out the Russian invad-
ers. 
Democrats and Republicans alike 
have sounded the alarm with bipar-
tisan pushes and legislation to help 
Ukraine. We have urged—with success, 
by the way—that the United States cut 
off our own Russian oil and gas. We are 
now urging the Europeans to do the 
same. 
We have talked about the need for 
more weapons, for more sanctions, to 
remove all of Russia’s banks’ access to 
the global financial system—or the 
SWIFT system—to suspend our tax 
treaty with Moscow, to explore options 
to remove other tax benefits, and to re-
move access to the U.S. market. 
All of this is necessary, on the mili-
tary side, the humanitarian side, the 
economic side, and the sanctions side 
in order to have a victory. I fear some-
times with regard to the military as-
sistance that we have been doing too 
little, too late. 
We can’t continue to do too little, 
too late. This is a struggle. It is a 
struggle between freedom and democ-
racy and the right of self-determina-
tion on the one hand and on the other 
hand, Russian aggression unprovoked, 
a brutal conquest, authoritarianism, 
and tyranny. 
President Putin’s ambitions lie well 
beyond Ukraine. We must continue to 
show him the West continues to stand 
united. We need to show Ukraine the 
world stands with them. This is why it 
is so important that Sweden and Fin-
land have chosen to join NATO, and we 
must support them in that. 
All this, by the way, transcends the 
political spectrum, and I have cer-
tainly seen that. Senator SHAHEEN and 
I have shown that in our work to aid 
Ukraine. It is not a political issue. It is 
not a Republican or Democrat issue. 
We are stepping up in support of our 
democratic ally together. 
As the fight rages on, the persever-
ance and self-determination of Ukrain-
ians seem to grow even stronger. We 
have seen their resilience in the face of 
daily bombardments. We have seen 
their resilience in the face of Russia’s 
broken promises when, counter to their 
commitments, Russia has attacked 
ports, as I said, and humanitarian cor-
ridors. 
The Ukrainian people are fighting for 
their homeland, for their families, for 
their freedom. It is impressive and in-
spiring to see what they are doing. 
The Senate is going to break for an 
August recess here in the next few 
days. Even though we won’t be on the 
floor every week to continue to fight 
for the Ukrainian people, we will do so 
with our work back home, with getting 
more people engaged and involved in 
America to help on the humanitarian 
side. We will continue to promote the 
fact that the U.S. national security in-
terest is served by helping freedom and 
democracy. 
I want to note something President 
Zelenskyy said recently in an address 
to the people of Ukraine. He said: 
Strategically, Russia has no chance of win-
ning this war. And it is necessary to hold on, 
so that even at the tactical levels, the terror 
state feels its defeat. No matter what hap-
pens and no matter what the occupiers’ plans 
are, we must do our job, protect our state 
and take care of each other. 
Let’s help Ukraine finish this mis-
sion, protect their state, their democ-
racy, and take care of each other. Let’s 
give Ukraine the tools it needs to be 
able to do that. After these months of 
fighting and giving aid, the West must 
not falter during Ukraine’s dire time of 
need. We must be there through vic-
tory for the Ukrainian people—victory 
for self-determination, victory for free-
dom. 
I yield to my colleague from New 
Hampshire, Senator SHAHEEN, my part-
ner in this effort. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
am really pleased to be able to come to 
the floor this afternoon to join my col-
league from Ohio, Senator PORTMAN. 
We twice traveled to Ukraine together. 
I have appreciated his leadership as co-
chair of the Ukraine Caucus and his ad-
vocacy for not only legislation to help 
Ukraine but also for these reports 
which weekly have kept the war in 
Ukraine in front of the American peo-
ple, which is so important as we think 
about how we continue support in our 
public 
for 
what 
is 
happening 
in 
Ukraine and this fight that the Ukrain-
ians are so courageously waging. 
I am also pleased to be here with my 
colleague Senator TILLIS, who, along 
with me, cochairs the Senate NATO 
Observer Group, because we are going 
to be voting this afternoon on ratifica-
tion of the accession of Finland and 
Sweden to NATO. Together, we led a 
bipartisan delegation to Madrid last 
month, which included three Demo-
crats and four Republicans, and we 
were able to visit Helsinki and Stock-
holm on our way into Madrid to talk 
about just why it is so important that 
Finland and Sweden are joining NATO. 
I wanted to talk about both of these 
topics this afternoon because they are 
connected. 
As Senator PORTMAN said, there is a 
reason why Finland and Sweden, after 
decades of maintaining neutrality, are 
looking at joining NATO. It is because 
of this unprovoked, brutal war by Rus-
sia against Ukraine. If they are suc-
cessful in Ukraine, we don’t know 
where that will end, so we need to 
make the connection for people. 
A year ago, no one would have 
thought that Sweden and Finland 
would have wanted NATO membership, 
but, of course, a lot has happened in 
that year. 
Vladimir Putin made one of the most 
consequential miscalculations in mod-
ern history. I think it is the biggest 
miscalculation in foreign policy since 
Hitler went into Russia in World War 
II. He went into Ukraine to wage this 
unprovoked, premeditated war upon 
the people of Ukraine. Part of his ra-
tionale was to talk about NATO and 
his opposition to Ukraine’s joining 
NATO but also because he thought he 
would be able to stall the enlargement 
of NATO. He thought he would be able 
to split the NATO allies. In fact, just 
the opposite has happened. The global 
response to punish Putin for this war 
in Ukraine is unprecedented. Putin’s 
barbaric campaign in Ukraine and 
threats to democracy around the world 
have resulted in the strongest iteration 
of NATO to date. 
And now here we are. The United 
States is about to welcome two very 
capable, very qualified and deserving 
members into the alliance, which will 
further strengthen our global coordina-
tion to preserve our rules-based order. 
I have spoken before in this Chamber 
about the strong bipartisan support for

Finland and Sweden’s NATO member-
ship. When Sweden and Finland an-
nounced their intent to apply for 
NATO membership, Senator TILLIS and 
I led a letter to President Biden that 
within about 24 hours was cosigned by 
80 of our colleagues, all pledging to 
support swift ratification of the acces-
sion protocols. 
Just last month, Senator TILLIS and 
I led that delegation to Madrid to the 
NATO summit, and we did it at the re-
quest of both the majority leader, 
SCHUMER, and the minority leader, 
MCCONNELL. 
When meeting with our allies and 
partners, we talked about our commit-
ment to return to the Senate and to 
work hard to swiftly ratify the acces-
sion protocols, and we have done just 
that. We had hoped to be the first body 
to do that ratification. We are going to 
be the 22nd, which I think is very good 
news for NATO and for the effort to en-
sure that Finland and Sweden become 
members of NATO. 
On July 19, the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, on which Senator 
PORTMAN and I sit, unanimously voted 
in support of NATO’s accession proto-
cols. 
Today’s vote is not just important 
for Sweden and Finland and for NATO, 
but it is also important for Ukraine, as 
Senator PORTMAN laid out. The Ukrain-
ian people are on the frontlines of a 
war for democracy and for our collec-
tive shared values—values that under-
pin the heart of the NATO alliance. 
Sweden and Finland’s membership will 
bolster our efforts to hold Putin to ac-
count as he wages this war to eradicate 
Ukrainian culture. 
Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine 
affirmed what we have long known— 
that Vladimir Putin does not respect 
the distinct history, culture, and iden-
tity of the Ukrainian people. His view 
of history, of course, is false. It is dis-
torted, 
and 
it 
is 
deadly. 
His 
unprovoked war in Ukraine is a mani-
festation of his delusional ideas and his 
blatant attempt to wipe Ukraine off 
the map of Europe. But despite the 
challenges to their sovereignty, for 
generations, the Ukrainian people have 
maintained their own traditions, their 
own language, and their own dream of 
independence. 
Putin is waging propaganda cam-
paigns that seek to justify his goals to 
the Russian people. He has deployed de-
liberate, harmful rhetoric of ‘‘de-Nazi-
fying’’ Ukraine. He is pursuing a broad-
er, maniacal agenda to eradicate every-
thing Ukrainian—the land, the people, 
the language, the culture. 
We know that Russia established fil-
tration camps in Russia and Ukrainian 
territory even before the February 24 
invasion. Now reports are that there 
are over 1 million Ukrainians who have 
been forcibly relocated to Russia, in-
cluding about 250,000 children—children 
who 
have 
been 
taken 
from 
their 
Ukrainian parents and sent to Russia. 
We need to call Putin’s actions what 
they are. They are acts of genocide. 
After the horrors of the Holocaust, the 
Rwandan genocide, Yugoslav wars, the 
international 
community 
vowed 
to 
‘‘never again’’ let such immense human 
tragedy happen on our watch. 
We must not let Putin accomplish his 
mission of destroying the Ukrainian 
people 
and 
dismantling 
the 
inter-
national rules-based order which has 
been in place for more than 70 years. 
We must hold him accountable because 
we know that if he is successful, 
Putin’s Russification campaign is not 
going to end with Ukraine. Who will be 
next? The Baltic States? Eastern Euro-
pean countries? Romania? Poland? 
As Americans, we have a moral obli-
gation to work with our allies to hold 
Putin to account, and I am proud that 
this body is doing just that. Last week, 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, of which Senator PORTMAN and 
I are both members, introduced a reso-
lution recognizing Russia’s actions in 
Ukraine as genocide, but, of course, we 
must do more. 
Today’s ratification vote is going to 
be another step in sending a message to 
both Vladimir Putin and the Ukrainian 
people that NATO is unified and that 
we are going to continue to support 
their efforts to push back against this 
brutal dictator. 
I hope that our colleagues will join 
us in celebrating today’s important 
moment of NATO’s enlargement from 
30 to 32 members. This historic acces-
sion is a testament to the global com-
mitment to not be bystanders amid a 
war that violates all international 
norms and seeks to destabilize our 
rules-based order. I hope that our re-
maining NATO allies will move swiftly 
to 
advance 
Sweden 
and 
Finland’s 
NATO membership. 
Amid Russia’s horrific campaign of 
ethnic cleansing against the Ukrainian 
people, we must recognize the impor-
tance of our shared transatlantic val-
ues to push back on Putin’s dangerous 
and bloodthirsty war against Ukraine. 
Again, I am pleased that we are here 
to support both Ukraine and the ratifi-
cation of Sweden and Finland into 
NATO. I am sure we will have a very 
strong bipartisan vote this afternoon, 
and I look forward to continuing to 
work with NATO and with our col-
leagues as we do everything we can to 
support the success of Ukraine against 
Vladimir Putin. 
I yield to my cochair of the Senate 
NATO Observer Group, Senator TILLIS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I 
want to thank my friend and colleague 
Senator PORTMAN for his work and his 
focus on Ukraine, and I want to thank 
my friend and colleague Senator SHA-
HEEN. It has been a real pleasure once 
we started up the Senate NATO Ob-
server Group after it had been dormant 
for some time. Who knew that it could 
have been more timely several years 
ago when we began that process? 
I was thinking—I have used this 
analogy before. I grew up in a family of 
six kids. We, even to this day, have our 
differences and disagreements. I have 
one sister I am pretty sure wouldn’t 
vote for me if she lived in North Caro-
lina. We are not ideologically aligned. 
But I know she loves me, and I know, 
when our family gets threatened, there 
is no difference between us. 
That is what Vladimir Putin saw on 
February 24. He saw the family of na-
tions in NATO come together like he 
couldn’t possibly have imagined, and 
he saw two nations, Finland and Swe-
den, after decades of being nonaligned, 
saying: Enough is enough. Now it is 
time to pick between good and evil. 
And evil is Vladimir Putin, and good is 
Western democracies—Western democ-
racies like Finland and Sweden which 
respect the rule of law, which respect 
the rights of their citizens, which re-
spect the free press, which invest in 
their military, and which will be a net 
exporter of security the day they enter 
NATO. 
As a matter of fact, they are already 
a very valuable asset to NATO. I have 
spoken with many of my colleagues in 
the Department of Defense, many peo-
ple in uniform. They laud the relation-
ship that they have with the military 
in Finland and Sweden. They work to-
gether on exercises. They know that 
Finland has a formidable ground force. 
They know that Sweden has a formi-
dable navy that is going to give us 
added presence in the Baltics and added 
presence in the Arctic. 
The worst possible scenario that 
Putin never anticipated was a com-
pletely unified NATO and the addition 
of 
830 
miles—1,340 
kilometers—of 
NATO border right up against Russia. 
That is what he has gotten for his ille-
gal invasion of Ukraine, and the blood 
of thousands are on Vladimir Putin’s 
hands. 
Now I want to talk a little bit about 
Finland and Sweden, but I also have to 
start with that letter. I remember viv-
idly, Senator SHAHEEN, when we were 
meeting with Swedish diplomats and 
the Defense Minister, and we were say-
ing: What can we do to send a signal to 
the people of Finland and Sweden that 
the United States is absolutely sup-
portive of their accession to NATO? 
And they said: Well, communications 
would be good. 
And we said: Well, we will do a letter. 
In 24 hours, we got 80 signatures. 
Now, the question would be, Why not 
the other 20? Quite honestly, we didn’t 
take the time. Everybody that we went 
to signed on to the letter, but we 
thought it was important to get that 
communication out quickly. 
Today, we are going to see more than 
95 Senators—I think even more than 
that—vote 
for 
ratification 
because 
they understand that Finland and Swe-
den are investing in their military. 
They understand that Finland is al-
ready at 2 percent and continuing to 
invest. They know that Finland has al-
ready put on order 64 F–35 Joint Strike 
Fighters. 
Why is that extraordinary? Finland 
is about half the population of my

August 3, 2022 
State, North Carolina, about 51⁄2 mil-
lion people. They have on order 64 
Joint Strike Fighters. We have fewer 
than 200 in full operation here in the 
United States. If we, on a per capita 
basis, were to have as many Joint 
Strike Fighters as Finland intends to 
have, we would need more than 4,000. 
Now, let’s talk about Sweden. Their 
industrial base is extraordinary. They 
have 
advanced 
fighter 
technology. 
They have advanced submarine tech-
nology. They have an industrial base 
that can be mobilized. They have an in-
dustrial base that is already developing 
platforms that are NATO interoper-
able. 
When they come in, they are not 
going to have to do some sort of NATO 
101. They are going to get to work. 
They are going to continue the work 
they are already doing. 
And, in Sweden’s case, there are 
some members here concerned about 
burden sharing and hitting the 2 per-
cent mark. When we were in Stock-
holm, we talked about this. When we 
met with the diplomatic and Defense 
Ministers, we talked about this. They 
are on their way. They are committed. 
Their government officials are com-
mitted to getting to 2 percent funding, 
and thank goodness. 
Maybe that sends a message to some 
of our other NATO countries that they 
need to get up there. If anything, 
Ukraine has taught us that we have to 
be ready, and we have to be at that 
level of burden sharing. 
But I am not in the least bit con-
cerned with Finland and Sweden meet-
ing their target. They are going to do 
it, and they are going to do it on short 
order. I believe that Sweden will be 
there by 2027, early 2028. 
So now, we have to move forward. 
Now, I am also being a little bit com-
petitive. I am disappointed that we 
weren’t the first nation, but I am also 
very optimistic. I am thrilled that so 
many nations have already recognized 
how valuable they will be as full- 
fledged NATO allies. So we are going to 
be 22nd, but we are doing it in record 
time. Everybody knows here that I de-
scribe this place as a ‘‘Crockpot.’’ It 
takes a long time to cook something in 
the U.S. Senate. 
For us to do this in less than a month 
is absolutely extraordinary, and I hope 
that the people of Sweden and the peo-
ple of Finland recognize that that is 
because the U.S. Senate has full con-
fidence in them. We welcome them 
readily, and we look forward to their 
accession. This step in ratifying the 
treaty is a great step. So I encourage 
all of our Members to consider voting 
for Finland and Sweden. 
The last thing I will leave you with is 
that there are some here who say: Well, 
we can’t really worry about Russia. We 
have to worry about China. 
We have to worry about both, and 
NATO is worried about both. If you 
look at the strategic concept that 
came out of Madrid, you should also 
recognize that there were four coun-
tries from INDOPACOM that were at a 
NATO summit. They recognize that we 
have to look at China and recognize 
the threat. But they also recognize 
that we have an immediate threat in 
Europe, and we have to stand together. 
With NATO, I am very proud of how 
the partners came together, and with 
Sweden and Finland, I am going to be 
even more proud of our alliance when 
they are full-fledged members. And we 
are going to work as hard as we can as 
members of the Senate NATO Observer 
Group to make sure that the remaining 
countries follow suit quickly so that 
we can welcome both of these great na-
tions into the greatest alliance that 
has ever existed. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
rise today to discuss American na-
tional security and the decisions that 
we must make to keep this Nation safe. 
The Senate will vote today on wheth-
er to expand NATO by admitting Swe-
den and Finland. I intend to vote no, 
and I encourage my colleagues to do 
the same, and I want to say a word or 
two as to why. 
Finland and Sweden want to expand 
NATO because it is in their national 
security interest to do so, and fair 
enough. The question that should prop-
erly be before us, however, is, ‘‘Is it in 
the United States’ interest to do so?’’ 
because that is what American foreign 
policy is supposed to be about, I 
thought. 
It is about American security, pro-
tecting American workers, defending 
American jobs, and securing American 
prosperity, and I fear that some in this 
town have lost sight of that. They 
think American foreign policy is about 
creating a liberal world order or nation 
building overseas. With all due respect, 
they are wrong. Our foreign policy 
should be about protecting the United 
States, our freedoms, our people, our 
way of life, and expanding NATO, I be-
lieve, would not do that. 
Listen, we should tell the truth 
about the consequences of the decision 
that we are going to take today. Ex-
panding NATO will require more U.S. 
forces 
in 
Europe—more 
manpower, 
more firepower, more resources, more 
spending—and not just now but over 
the long haul. 
But our greatest foreign adversary is 
not in Europe. Our greatest foreign ad-
versary is in Asia, and when it comes 
to countering that adversary, we are 
behind the game. I am talking, of 
course, about China. The communist 
government of Beijing has adopted a 
policy of imperialism. It wants to 
dominate its neighbors, dictate to free 
nations. It is trying to expand its 
power at every opportunity, and that 
includes power over the United States. 
Beijing wants power over our trade, 
over our jobs, over our economy. They 
want us to come to them and beg for 
market access. They, ultimately, want 
to 
reign 
supreme 
as 
the 
world 
hegemon, the world’s sole superpower. 
And, listen, Chinese leaders have said 
it themselves. This is no mystery. Bei-
jing wants a world in which the United 
States—and all other nations, for that 
matter—are forced to bow before Chi-
na’s might. It is their stated ambition. 
This would be a world in which the 
Chinese Government and its proxies 
would touch every aspect of our lives, 
from Chinese goods dominating our 
markets, to Chinese propaganda flood-
ing our airwaves, to Chinese money 
and influence corrupting American pol-
itics. 
This would be a world in which China 
would be free to expand its use of slave 
labor and to double down on its global 
campaigns of repression. That is the 
world that Beijing wants, and the truth 
is we are not now in a position to stop 
them. 
Let me say that again: The truth is 
we are not now in a position to stop 
them. That is a hard truth, but it is the 
truth, nonetheless, and the American 
people deserve to hear it. Our military 
forces in Asia are not postured as they 
should be. 
The commander of our forces in the 
Indo-Pacific has testified to this on 
multiple occasions. We do not have the 
weapons and equipment we need in the 
region. We don’t have enough advanced 
munitions. Sealift and airlift are far 
short of where they need to be. Attack 
submarines are some of the most im-
portant assets we have in Asia and Eu-
rope, but they are already in short sup-
ply and the fleet is sinking. 
On top of all of that, we do not yet 
have a coherent strategy for stopping 
China’s dominance in the Pacific, be-
ginning with the possible invasion of 
Taiwan, and we are not committing the 
attention and resources we need to de-
velop and implement that strategy. 
Why aren’t we prepared to do what 
we need to do in Asia? Well, because we 
have been distracted for too long—for 
decades—by nation-building activities 
in the Middle East and by legacy com-
mitments in Europe. 
So now, the choice is this: We can do 
more in Europe, devote more resources, 
more manpower, more firepower there, 
or—or—we can do what we need to do 
in Asia to deter China. We cannot do 
both. We cannot do both. 
The Chief of Naval Operations re-
cently testified that the joint force is 
simply not sized to handle two simulta-
neous conflicts. That is the reality. 
Both the 2018 and the 2022 national de-
fense strategies—which were devel-
oped, I might point out, by different 
administrations of different political 
parties—reached the same conclusion. 
We have to choose. It is not enough 
to simply say that China is the pacing 
threat or to say that the risk to Tai-
wan is real. We must do something 
about it. We have to prioritize. We 
have to focus, and that means we have 
to do less in Europe in order to 
prioritize America’s most pressing na-
tional security interest, which is in 
Asia, with regard to China.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3888 
August 3, 2022 
Now, this isn’t to say that the United 
States should abandon NATO, but it is 
to say that our European allies really 
must do more. They must take primary 
responsibility for the conventional de-
fense of Europe and rely on U.S. forces 
for our nuclear deterrent and select 
conventional assets. 
And this is not just so that America 
can focus on China, although that is of 
overriding importance to us. No, this is 
also about NATO’s future. European al-
lies have to step up now or risk leaving 
NATO exposed if the United States and 
our forces are pulled from Europe into 
a conflict in the Pacific. 
Every European ally must make nec-
essary investments now for today’s 
threat environment or risk the worst, 
but NATO isn’t doing that. Our Euro-
pean allies are far from where they 
should be. You know, NATO states 
agreed years ago, back in 2006, to spend 
at least 2 percent of GDP on defense, 
but many NATO members still haven’t 
met that pledge. Meanwhile, the NATO 
Supreme Allied Commander in Europe 
testified a few weeks ago that our al-
lies need to spend more than 2 percent 
just to meet existing—existing—ground 
force requirements, which brings us 
back to Sweden and Finland. 
Both countries are longtime NATO 
defense partners and strong opponents 
of Russian imperialism. Both occupy 
important geography. They are also ad-
vanced economies with capable mili-
taries, and I respect all of that. But 
Finland and Sweden’s admission would 
also bring distinct challenges. Sweden 
still isn’t spending 2 percent of GDP on 
defense, and it doesn’t plan to until at 
least 2028. Finland has announced a 
one-time defense spending boost, but it 
is not clear whether it will sustain 
those 
higher 
investments, 
which, 
again, are the minimum investments 
needed for NATO. 
Now, some say we shouldn’t worry 
about any of this. Some say Finland 
and Sweden can defend themselves and 
won’t require anything through the 
United States or our NATO allies. But 
if that were true, why join NATO? 
The truth is, both countries want 
NATO’s help defending themselves. 
That is why they are applying for 
membership—and fair enough. But be-
cause so many current NATO allies 
have spent years underfunding their 
militaries, it will be the United States 
that will be asked to send forces to 
help defend Sweden and Finland in a 
time of crisis. Even absent a crisis, 
NATO expansion will mean more U.S. 
forces and U.S. firepower in Europe for 
the long term. 
Now, if we want to make NATO 
stronger, the right course is to increase 
the amount that member states spend 
on their own defense—say to 21⁄2 per-
cent—and press our European allies to 
take primary responsibility for Eu-
rope’s conventional defense. But this 
administration—it is going in exactly 
the opposite direction. They had the 
chance to push for greater European 
military spending and investment at 
the recent Madrid summit. They didn’t 
do it. Instead, the Biden administra-
tion has committed the United States 
to massive spending in Ukraine, far 
outpacing our European allies, even as 
they surged tens of thousands of troops 
into that region, apparently for good. 
Now, some say expanding NATO will 
allow the United States to do less in 
Europe. I wish that were true, but how 
can it be when NATO is overdependent 
on American support right now? How 
would 
increasing 
NATO’s 
security 
needs somehow magically enable the 
United States to do less? The fact is, 
NATO expansion will generate new re-
quirements. Sweden has already asked 
the United States to increase its naval 
presence in the Baltic area, for exam-
ple. 
Now, make no mistake, expanding 
NATO means expanded obligations for 
the United States in Europe. That is 
the nature of a security commitment. 
Some say we need to expand NATO in 
Europe to deter China in Asia. But 
China isn’t going to be deterred by the 
number of our commitments in Europe; 
China is going to be deterred by our 
power to deny their imperial ambitions 
in Asia. That is it. That is the whole 
ball game. 
We cannot strengthen our deterrent 
posture in the Pacific if we are sending 
more forces and resources to Europe to 
defend new allies. That is the bottom 
line. 
Finally, some say we can’t beat 
China by retreating from the rest of 
the world, but I am not arguing for re-
treat, and I am not arguing for isola-
tion. What I am arguing for is an end 
to the globalist foreign policy that has 
led our Nation from one disaster to an-
other for decades now. What I am argu-
ing for is the return to a classic nation-
alist approach to American foreign pol-
icy, the one that made this country 
great; a foreign policy that is grounded 
in our Nation’s interests and in the re-
ality of the world as it is, not as we 
wish it was or not as we once hoped it 
would be. 
In years past, NATO was a bulwark 
against an imperial Soviet Union. 
Today, the world’s greatest imperial 
threat is in Asia, and the hour to ad-
dress that threat is growing very late. 
We owe the American people this 
truth. We owe them a clear accounting 
of facts. We owe them the courage to 
make tough choices. Today, I submit 
that means voting against expanding 
NATO and focusing where we must, to 
do what we must, to deter an imperial 
China. This isn’t an easy vote, to be 
sure, but it is the right one for our se-
curity, for our prosperity, for our peo-
ple, for our Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The senior Senator from 
Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I rise today in support of Finland and 
Sweden’s application to join NATO. I 
give my strong support to this applica-
tion. 
I disagree heartily with our colleague 
from Missouri. I know you know, 
Madam President, having worked on 
this issue, as I have—having visited 
these countries, we know how impor-
tant they are to Minnesota and Wis-
consin. 
Minnesota has a special bond with 
the Kingdom of Sweden and the Repub-
lic of Finland, and at the core of this 
bond, at the core of the bond between 
our country and these countries, is 
shared values—values of democracy, 
values of freedom. 
Yes, we have challenges—of course 
we do—in Asia, but I happen to believe 
that when you are a great power like 
the United States of America, you can 
do two things at once. 
Let’s look at what these countries 
add to our security by joining NATO. 
First of all, Finland is over 2 percent 
of their budget on military. Sweden is 
increasing their budget on military. 
Both nations have professional mili-
taries. They have strong and trans-
parent economies, and mostly they be-
lieve in human rights—in freedom, in 
liberty, and equality. They believe in 
democracy. 
I will note specifically that Finland 
has added an extra $2.2 billion in de-
fense spending this year. Greece and 
Poland and Lithuania and Latvia and 
Estonia and Slovakia and Croatia and 
the United Kingdom—above 2 percent. 
So let’s get the facts straight here, 
and let’s talk about what these coun-
tries will add to our security. 
We are at an unparalleled moment in 
history. Since Vladimir Putin’s cruel, 
unjustified invasion of Ukraine, people 
all over the world have been waking up 
out of a 2-year plague, out of a slum-
ber, to realize just how fragile our de-
mocracy is. 
We realized it here in this building 
when, not so long along, insurrection-
ists invaded this Chamber. We didn’t 
just sit back and say: Well, there goes 
our democracy. We stood up. We stood 
up, Democrats and Republicans, in this 
very Chamber. 
When 
President 
Zelenskyy 
of 
Ukraine took to the streets the minute 
that this invasion started and looked 
at a video camera and said: We are 
here, he was saying that to his own 
people to give them the courage to 
stand up against the inhuman barba-
rism of a dictator, but he was also say-

We see it on Ukraine’s frontlines, 
where everyday people took up arms 
and are taking up arms to protect their 
country. It sent a warning shot to ty-
rants around the world who believe 
that free democracies are just up for 
grabs. Ukrainians have shown their 
true colors in bright blue and yellow, 
which just happen to be the colors of 
Sweden. They have shown their true 
colors, and they are showing the world 
what courage is all about. 
Having been in the last group of Sen-
ators from this Chamber who met with 
leaders in Ukraine just a few weeks be-
fore the war started, I can tell you

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3889 
August 3, 2022 
this: The people of Ukraine want to 
choose their own destiny, and the 
moral flame they have lit across the 
world will not be doused. 
Russia’s unprovoked aggression in 
Ukraine has changed how we think 
about the world’s security. That is why 
I strongly support the decision of these 
two great democracies, Sweden and 
Finland, to join the most important 
and defensive alliance in the world— 
NATO. 
When President Biden met in May 
with 
Finnish 
and 
Swedish 
leaders 
about their application to join NATO, 
he said the people of Sweden and Fin-
land—he said to them that they ‘‘have 
the full, total, and complete backing of 
the United States of America.’’ We sup-
ported that. The Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations echoed its support 
with an overwhelming bipartisan vote 
just last month. Our leaders support 
this pact. 
By joining NATO, allies made a sa-
cred commitment to one another that 
an attack on one is an attack on all. 
The only time in history this has been 
invoked was after 9/11, when the United 
States was attacked, and all our allies 
rallied to our side. As Americans, we 
have never and will never forget that. 
In June, we celebrated the anniver-
sary of the end of World War II in Eu-
rope. NATO was formed in the wreck-
age of World War II. When President 
Truman signed the North Atlantic 
Treaty, he expressed the goal of its 
founders ‘‘to preserve their present 
peaceful situation and to protect it in 
the future.’’ And for decades, it has 
been crucial to upholding that peace. 
Now, 73 years later, NATO is as im-
portant as ever, and the recent deci-
sions made by our great friends, the 
great countries of Sweden and Finland, 
are a testament to the continued prom-
ise of this alliance. 
As 
Swedish 
Prime 
Minister 
Andersson said in May: 
With Sweden and Finland as members, 
NATO will also be stronger. We are security 
providers with sophisticated defense capa-
bilities. 
That is correct. 
And we are champions of freedom, democ-
racy, and human rights. 
That is correct. 
As 
Finland’s 
leaders, 
President 
Niinisto and Prime Minister Marin, 
also said: 
NATO membership would strengthen Fin-
land’s security. As a member of NATO, Fin-
land would strengthen the entire defense al-
liance. 
I had the honor of being on a panel at 
the Munich Security Conference with 
President Niinisto, and I saw firsthand 
his commitment to the democracy in 
Finland and to the democracy all over 
the world. 
Finland and Sweden are already 
among our closest partners on a range 
of issues. They are already important 
contributors to the international com-
munity, including in the United Na-
tions, the Organization for Security 
and Co-operation in Europe, and other 
international organizations. 
Finnish and Swedish troops have al-
ready served shoulder to shoulder with 
U.S. and NATO forces in Kosovo, in 
Bosnia. 
In 1994, Sweden and Finland joined 
NATO’s Partnership for Peace pro-
gram, strengthening our official rela-
tionship and coming one step closer to 
being a full-fledged NATO member. 
NATO, Finland, and Sweden have 
partnered together on securing the Bal-
tic Sea region through regular con-
versations and exercises—a practice 
that will be even more important now. 
In 2018, Finland, Sweden, and the 
United States signed a trilateral agree-
ment to deepen defense cooperation 
and promote security in Northern Eu-
rope. 
Both Finland and Sweden are already 
working 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
United States and other allies and 
partners to support brave Ukrainians 
standing up to Vladimir Putin. 
Sweden has responded to Russia’s 
bombing of maternity hospitals with 
millions of dollars of support and hel-
mets and body shields, as well as bil-
lions for the refugees flowing from 
Ukraine. Finland has sent military aid, 
including thousands of assault rifles 
and 70,000 ration packages, and has of-
fered millions of dollars in humani-
tarian aid. 
Both nations also have the potential, 
as I noted, to bring huge assets to this 
alliance, not, as my colleague from 
Missouri implied, to somehow make 
things harder. Are you kidding? Maybe 
he hasn’t seen these countries. I have. 
Finland, after fighting its own terri-
torial wars with the Soviet Union, has 
a reserve force of 900,000 strong. Swe-
den has built its own fighter jets. Both 
countries recently announced upcom-
ing expansion and reform of their mili-
taries. 
As the Arctic region, which holds in-
creasing importance for U.S. and Euro-
pean 
security, 
sees 
encroachments 
from Russia and China—may I add to 
my colleague from Missouri—Sweden 
and Finland are poised to help NATO 
confront these challenges. 
I am here to give my full support for 
Sweden and Finland entering NATO. 
As we made clear, we stand with Swe-
den, we stand with Finland, and we 
stand with democracy. 
Russia’s war in Ukraine—a full-scale, 
unprovoked, 
and 
premeditated 
war 
against a sovereign and democratic 
country—has changed Europe and the 
world, but it has also demonstrated the 
importance and resilience of our trans-
atlantic alliance. We have all wit-
nessed the bravery of the Ukrainian 
people as they fight for their lives, and 
we are proud to stand with them. 
This is about the future of political 
freedom, economic freedom, techno-
logical freedom, and, yes, democratic 
freedom. 
Finland and Sweden taking the step 
of NATO membership will not only 
strengthen their own security but the 
cause of freedom in Europe and around 
the world. 
I would say, when things are tough, 
we keep our friends closer, and I be-
lieve that this strong NATO and the in-
clusion of Sweden and Finland will ac-
tually help us with the rest of the 
world, not just with this conflict in 
Ukraine. 
So I ask my colleague from Missouri, 
who is not here right now, to consider 
that as we look at our alliances and 
how we deal with China. We must 
strengthen our trade alliances. We 
must strengthen our military alli-
ances. Certainly, including Finland and 
Sweden as a member of NATO is one 
big positive step. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate exercises one of our 
unique and most important constitu-
tional responsibilities: debate and rati-
fication of a treaty. 
The NATO accession treaty for Swe-
den and Finland is the most consequen-
tial kind of treaty because it commits 
America to the mutual defense of an-
other country. We commit, along with 
our NATO partners, to come to Swe-
den’s and Finland’s defense if they are 
attacked, just as Finland and Sweden 
will come to our defense if we are at-
tacked. It is a weighty matter, indeed. 
I want to explain why, if one hon-
estly considers all the circumstances 
and weighs all the evidence, I don’t be-
lieve this is a close debate at all. 
If Finland and Sweden join NATO, 
the alliance will unquestionably be 
stronger. The risk of war and of Amer-
ica being dragged into war will de-
crease in Europe, and Vladimir Putin’s 
unprovoked war of aggression against 
Ukraine will backfire in another sig-
nificant, lasting way. 
I note at the outset how unusual this 
moment is. Finland and Sweden are 
historically neutral countries. Sweden 
has refrained from joining military al-
liances since the days of Napoleon. 
Once Finland obtained independence a 
century ago, it also charted a course of 
neutrality, even after the Soviet Union 
invaded Finland during World War II. 
Now these historically neutral coun-
tries have petitioned to join NATO. 
Why? Sweden and, especially, Finland 
have always lived closer to the bear’s 
den, and thus had a different relation-
ship with Moscow than we do. But now 
the Russian bear is rampaging, maul-
ing a sovereign country on its borders 
that is not in the ranks of NATO. Fin-
land and Sweden naturally want to 
avoid Ukraine’s fate. They concluded, 
reasonably 
enough, 
that 
there 
is 
strength in numbers, and they are 
right about that. 
If I were sitting in Stockholm or Hel-
sinki, I would want to join NATO, too. 
But we are here in the United States 
Senate. What matters to us—what 
should matter to us—is what is in it for 
us. Much as we may esteem the Finns 
and the Swedes—and we should; they 
are great people—we need allies who 
enhance our common defense, not ones

who detract from it, allies who can pull 
their own weight and then some. 
Military alliances are not charities, 
but Finland and Sweden aren’t charity 
cases. They bring into NATO their 
well-trained and well-equipped mili-
taries, technologically advanced econo-
mies, and vital geography. 
In particular, Finland is a country of 
warriors, with a long and proud tradi-
tion, to put it bluntly, of fighting and 
killing Russian invaders. In 1939, Rus-
sia launched an unprovoked war of ag-
gression—odd how Russia keeps doing 
that—against Finland, in what has be-
come known as the Winter War. Few 
observers gave small Finland a chance, 
but the outnumbered and outgunned 
Finns shocked the world—not least 
Stalin and the Russian communists— 
by matching the Red Army blow for 
blow. 
Ever wonder where the term ‘‘Molo-
tov cocktail’’ comes from? The Finns 
gave it to us. What they lacked in anti- 
tank weapons, they made up in grit 
and courage. Finnish soldiers rushed 
Soviet tanks and dropped the bottle 
bombs inside them, and they named 
the cocktail after Russia’s deceitful 
Foreign Minister for good measure. 
Then there is the legendary sniper 
Simo Hayha, who killed an estimated 
500 Russian soldiers, among the highest 
number of confirmed sniper kills ever 
recorded in combat. He entered into 
the history books better known by his 
well-earned nickname, ‘‘White Death,’’ 
which also happens to be what every 
Russian general to this day fears from 
another tangle with the Finns. 
The Finns also haven’t forgotten the 
lessons of the Winter War. Still today, 
every adult Finnish man must fulfill a 
period of national service. Almost all 
of them choose the military. Finland 
has a 900,000-man reserve it can draw 
on in times of crisis and can field an 
army of 280,000 when fully mobilized. 
Finland’s reserves are larger than the 
reserves 
of 
France, 
Germany, 
and 
Italy—combined. 
Finland has firepower in addition to 
manpower. According to scholars at 
the Foundation for the Defense of De-
mocracies, Finland has one of the 
strongest artillery forces in Europe, 
with more rocket launchers and howit-
zers than France, Germany, or the 
United Kingdom. It has a strong fleet 
of fighter jets and plans to buy 64 
American-made F–35s by the end of the 
decade. 
For its part, Sweden is an economic 
and industrial powerhouse that will 
add muscle to the alliance. The Swed-
ish Navy is an effective force with ad-
vanced warships and submarines. The 
Swedish firm Saab produces some of 
the world’s finest fighter aircraft, 
radar systems, and weapons. In con-
junction with the British, the Swedes 
manufacture the NLAW anti-tank mis-
sile, which is second only to the Jav-
elin 
in 
killing 
Russian 
tanks 
in 
Ukraine. I would also add that the 
Swedish firm Ericsson, along with the 
Finnish firm Nokia, are among the 
world’s few alternatives to China’s 
Huawei for advanced 5G telecommuni-
cations hardware. 
Finally, I should note that Finland 
and Sweden, unlike too many of our 
European allies, are putting their 
money where their mouths are when it 
comes to their defense. Following Rus-
sia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland 
boosted defense spending by 70 percent 
and will spend more than 2 percent of 
its total economy on its military this 
year. Sweden is in the middle of dou-
bling its defense spending and plans to 
reach that 2-percent goal no later than 
2028. 
For these reasons alone, Finland and 
Sweden are not only worthy additions 
to the alliance but, indeed, will become 
two of the strongest members of the al-
liance from the moment they join. 
But that is not all. They also add key 
geographic advantages to our alliance. 
First, the Swedish island of Gotland 
is an unsinkable aircraft carrier in the 
middle of the Baltic Sea—fewer than 
200 miles from the Russian exclave and 
military base in Kaliningrad. He who 
controls Gotland controls the Baltic, 
which is why Russia tried to seize Got-
land in the 19th century and why Swe-
den garrisoned the island during the 
Cold War. In the event of a conflict 
with Russia, NATO forces on Gotland 
could prevent the Russian Navy from 
transiting the Baltic Sea freely or from 
resupplying Kaliningrad by sea. Got-
land-based forces would also make it 
easier to relieve the Baltic States by 
sea and air in the event of a Russian 
invasion. 
Second, Finland controls the north-
ern shores of the Gulf of Finland, 
through which Russian ships must pass 
to reach St. Petersburg, Russia’s sec-
ond largest city. Our NATO ally Esto-
nia 
already 
controls 
the 
southern 
coastline of this long and narrow wa-
terway that is not even 30 miles wide 
at its smallest point. By adding Fin-
land to the alliance, Russian naval op-
erations through the gulf would be-
come even more difficult. 
Third, the Danish Straits would also 
become, in effect, NATO waters. Rus-
sia’s Baltic Fleet must pass through 
this strategic chokepoint to get in or 
out of the Baltic. Denmark, a NATO 
ally, controls the southern and western 
portions of the straits. Sweden controls 
the northern and eastern shores. By 
adding Sweden to the alliance, we fur-
ther complicate Russia’s naval oper-
ations. 
Fourth, the 800-mile border of Russia 
and Finland rightly complicates Rus-
sia’s war planning and defense in the 
event of conflict. In fact, this border 
would more than double the amount of 
border that Russia must defend. Fin-
land will also threaten Russia’s major 
military installations in the Kola Pe-
ninsula, where Russia’s largest and 
most advanced naval forces are posi-
tioned to break out into the Atlantic 
and threaten the United States. 
So aside from their military strength 
and economic power, Finland and Swe-
den also allow us to turn the Baltic 
into a NATO lake, bottle up Russia’s 
Baltic Fleet, cut off its isolated mili-
tary base at Kaliningrad, and expose 
Russia itself to much greater risk in 
the event of a conflict. 
All things considered, then, one 
might contend that Finland and Swe-
den are the strongest candidates to 
join NATO since its origin in 1949. We 
will soon see that most Senators agree, 
when we vote later today. 
And, really, how can one disagree? 
After all, the last countries to join 
NATO, Montenegro and North Mac-
edonia, were each approved by the Sen-
ate with only two ‘‘no’’ votes. Those 
countries brought their own case for 
accession to NATO. But let’s be honest. 
Who can deny the much stronger cases 
for Finland and Sweden, countries that 
are far larger and far more capable and 
far more strategically situated? 
It would be strange indeed for any 
Senator who voted to allow Monte-
negro or North Macedonia into NATO 
to turn around and deny membership 
to Finland and Sweden. I would love to 
hear the defense of such a curious vote. 
But since some observers have criti-
cized their bid for membership, let me 
address those arguments now. 
The most basic argument isn’t really 
directed at Finland or Sweden, but at 
NATO itself. Some critics say America 
shouldn’t pledge to protect countries 
halfway around the world, but these 
critics are seven decades too late. We 
are already treaty-bound to defend 
more than two dozen nations in Eu-
rope. Whether we support this treaty 
today or not, we will still be treaty- 
bound to defend those nations. So the 
real question today is whether adding 
two capable and strong nations to our 
mutual defense pact will make us 
stronger or weaker. The evidence I 
have shared demonstrates that adding 
Finland and Sweden will indeed make 
it stronger, more likely to deter Rus-
sian aggression and to defeat Russian 
aggression, should it come. 
Next, some opponents contend that 
admitting Finland, in particular, is a 
liability because the United States 
would be committing to the defense of 
its 800-mile border with Russia. This 
argument is both alarmist and back-
ward. It is alarmist because Russia 
hasn’t attacked a NATO member in its 
more than 70-year history, even as it 
has attacked many non-NATO coun-
tries. Given the Russian Army’s pitiful 
performance in Ukraine, they will be in 
no shape to break with that record any 
time soon. And of all European na-
tions, Finland is probably the least 
likely to be attacked by Russia after 
the searing trauma of the Winter War. 
‘‘White death’’ is a strong deterrent. 
Moreover, these critics are thinking 
about this issue backward. As I said 
earlier, it is Russia that has to worry 
about its long border should it attack 
our allies. NATO is a defensive alli-
ance. It always has been, always will 
be. Neither Finland nor any other 
NATO country has any plan or desire

to invade Russia. But should Russia 
ever be tempted to attack NATO, the 
Finnish border creates nearly insur-
mountable war-planning dilemmas for 
the Russian general staff. To borrow 
what U.S. Grant told his commanders 
about Robert E. Lee, rather than wor-
rying about what Russia might do at 
Finland’s border, Russia should be wor-
ried about what NATO would do if Rus-
sia attacks us. Putin seems worried, 
after all. He blustered and threatened 
consequences if Sweden and Finland 
sought NATO membership, but he 
meekly acquiesced once they did. 
Still, other critics say our main stra-
tegic focus should be on China, not 
Russia. I agree. China is the greatest 
long-term threat to the United States, 
but admitting Finland and Sweden to 
NATO enhances our common defense, 
especially our defenses in Europe. A 
NATO that is stronger militarily, eco-
nomically, and geographically in Eu-
rope is a NATO that needs to lean less 
on American power. We ought to wel-
come strong, capable allies in Europe 
who can free up the American military 
to focus more on the Pacific theater. 
That is doubly true when those allies 
have key companies, like Ericsson and 
Nokia, that can also help us beat China 
in the global technology race. 
Others have objected that the major-
ity of NATO members are currently 
failing to pay their fair share toward 
our common defense. I agree here too. 
I 
am 
tired 
of 
freeloading, 
grandstanding friends. But how is that 
a criticism of Sweden or Finland? As I 
said, Finland already pays its fair 
share, and Sweden has charted a clear-
er path there than have many current 
NATO members, and both nations are 
doing so for a reason more durable 
than diplomatic sweet talk—perceived 
danger. 
Some claim that expanding NATO 
will provoke Russian aggression, but 
the fact is, NATO expansion is the re-
sult, not the cause, of Russian aggres-
sion. Countries are banging on NATO’s 
door because of Russia’s behavior. In-
deed, Russian aggression is the cause of 
today’s debate. As I mentioned earlier, 
Sweden and Finland have long his-
tories of neutrality. Vladimir Putin’s 
violence toward his neighbors has now 
made that neutrality untenable in 
their minds. 
Finally, a few critics of NATO expan-
sion love to quote the words of George 
Washington’s Farewell Address. It is 
true our first President warned against 
‘‘permanent alliances,’’ and he rec-
ommended ‘‘as little political connec-
tion as possible’’ with other nations. 
That advice was well-suited for a 
young, weak Republic in 1796. Yet 
Washington didn’t stop writing where 
these critics stopped reading. That 
great statesman foresaw a future when 
America would gain strength, stand up, 
and assert itself. 
Washington continued: 
With me, a predominant motive has been 
to endeavor to gain time to our country to 
settle and mature its yet recent institutions, 
and to progress without interruption to that 
degree of strength and consistency, which is 
necessary to give it, humanly speaking, the 
command of its own fortunes. 
We have gained, since Washington’s 
time, the command of our own for-
tunes. 
One 
of 
the 
pillars 
of 
our 
strength in modern times is our net-
work of allies and partners in the Old 
World. 
These 
beachheads 
and 
lodgments of freedom help us keep the 
awful power of modern war at a dis-
tance. Finland and Sweden are two 
such nations. They have asked to join 
our mutual defense alliance, and they 
are worthy partners. 
I urge my colleagues to grant their 
request, ratify this treaty, and wel-
come two more strong beachheads and 
lodgments into the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, to 
the speaker who has just finished 
speaking, before he leaves the floor, he 
and I share the same initials, TC, and 
in this case, we share the same views 
on an important issue. It is great to 
have the TCs—the Tango Charlies— 
speaking from the same hymn book. 
On a lighter note, some of the con-
versation here today is pretty serious. 
This is a serious matter, but I want to 
make it, maybe, a little bit lighter. 
I am reminded today of the words of 
Harry Truman, our former President, 
who used to say that the only thing 
new in the world is the history we for-
got or never learned. The only thing 
new in the world is the history we for-
got or never learned. 
I want to take, if you will—as Pre-
siding Officer knows, every Tuesday, 
we have our caucus lunch, and the Re-
publicans have theirs. Unfortunately, 
we don’t dine together enough. But, at 
our caucus lunch, we have a history 
moment or a history minute—maybe a 
minute or 2. It is always one of the 
highlights, frankly, of the time we 
spend together. And I want to just look 
back a little bit in time as we take up, 
today, an issue that is right before us. 
As it turns out, the first Swedes and 
Finns came to America about 384 years 
ago. They themselves were from a 
place called Kalmar, Sweden. At the 
time, as we have heard from others 
who have spoken, Sweden and Finland 
were the same country. There was no 
Finland. All the Finns lived in Sweden, 
and they continued to live in Sweden 
for a good long time. I think the Swed-
ish lived—1809. In 1809, the Swedish 
rule over Finland officially came to an 
end, and Finland separated from Swe-
den. 
But when the two ships, the Kalmar 
Nyckel and the Fogel Grip, set sail from 
what was then Sweden, across the At-
lantic Ocean toward the Western Hemi-
sphere, they got close to land and 
ended up sailing north into what later 
would become the Delaware Bay. They 
sailed further north into what would 
become the more narrow channel of the 
Delaware River. They continued to 
sail. They didn’t go as far up as what is 
now 
Philadelphia, 
but 
they 
came 
across an uncharted river that went to 
the west. It was kind of a left turn off 
the Delaware River to the west. They 
sailed for about a mile, maybe a mile 
and a half. 
They decided that they would put 
down their anchors, and there was a 
bunch of rocks—big rocks—along the 
side of that river. They put down their 
anchors and declared that spot to be 
the colony of New Sweden. It is what is 
now Wilmington, DE—the colony of 
New Sweden. They raised their flag and 
said: This is where we are going to 
make our stand. 
That was, I think, maybe the first 
European colony, at least in my State, 
that was created. Later, it was taken 
over, I think, by the Dutch and then 
by, maybe, the British. But, initially, 
it was the Swedes and the Finns who 
colonized that spot. 
Delaware has one of the newest na-
tional parks in America, and it is a dif-
ferent kind of national park. It tells 
the story of Delawareans who were in-
volved in the earlier history of the set-
tlement of our country in leading up to 
the ratification of the Constitution on 
December 7, 1787, which took place in 
Dover, DE, our State capital, and Dela-
ware became the First State. For 1 
whole week, we were the entire United 
States of America. Then we opened it 
up and let in Maryland and Pennsyl-
vania and 47 or so more, including Wis-
consin. I think, for the most part, it 
has turned out pretty well. We have 
had some bumps in the road as the Pre-
siding Officer knows. 
The colony of New Sweden was in 
place for probably about 20 or 25 years. 
Then the Dutch took over, and then 
the British sort of took over the region 
in 1664. When the Dutch created the 
colony of New Sweden in what is now 
Wilmington, DE, they also built a 
church. They built what is now known 
as Old Swedes Church. We have got a 
lot of churches in this country and a 
lot of different faiths. The Old Swedes 
Church is believed to be, maybe, the 
longest continuously serving church in 
America. 
How is that for history? 
It is part of our national park that 
we created. We had somebody working 
on it for years, and we created it a dec-
ade or two ago. Old Swedes Church is 
still there; it is still doing the Lord’s 
work. 
This is a beautiful, beautiful picture. 
This is the Kalmar Nyckel at full sail. 
This is one of two ships that brought 
the Swedes and Finns to America—all 
384 years ago. This is the Swedish flag

tina River.

had headed down the river for about a 
mile, I would have come to this ship 
right on the Christina River. It has set 
sail many places around the world. It is 
really the ship that represents our 
State, which used to be the colony of 
New Sweden. 
We all get to meet people from dif-
ferent places around the world, and I 
have been privileged to meet a lot of 
Swedish Americans. It turns out that 
there are more Swedish Americans 
than there are Swedes in Sweden. Let 
me say that again. There are now more 
Swedish Americans than there are 
Swedes in Sweden. There are a bunch 
of them, and they contribute to our 
country and certainly to our State in 
many, many different ways. I work a 
lot on economic development and al-
ways have as Governor and even now, 
and some of the finest businesspeople I 
have ever met are Swedes, of Swedish 
extraction. 
I have a funny story, if I could. Every 
25 years, the King and Queen of Sweden 
come to revisit the colony of New Swe-
den, and we have a big celebration for 
a couple days right along the banks of 
this river, the Christina River. By the 
way, all those years ago, when the first 
Swedes and Finns came ashore, they 
named the Christina River after their 
child Queen, who at the time was—you 
won’t believe it—12 years old, 12 years 
old. Imagine peaking at the age of 12 
and becoming a Queen or a King. Of 
course, the Christina, that river, is 
named after her. 
I like to point out to women who are 
named Christina—I tell them that 
their heritage, their name, actually 
goes back to all of those years when 
the first Swedes and Finns came here 
and helped to settle our country. 
Anyway, once every 25 years, the 
King and Queen of Sweden come to 
visit us. In 2013, King Carl XVI and 
Queen Silvia of Sweden came to Dela-
ware for several days. We had a huge 
celebration on the banks of the Chris-
tina River, and I had the privilege of 
sitting next to the Queen during din-
ner. It was a big banquet with hundreds 
of people in black tie. It was a beau-
tiful evening with great music and 
wonderful speeches. And she and I just 
had a delightful time talking over din-
ner. 
We talked about the arts. I like 
films, and I believe the Presiding Offi-
cer is a big film buff. One of my early 
favorite directors is Ingmar Bergman, 
a Swede, who made great films for 
many, many years. We talked about his 
films and the films that actually 
touched our lives and helped shape our 
lives. We talked about music. We 
talked about music. 
I said to the Queen of Sweden: Your 
Highness, I don’t know where I got 
this, but for some reason, I make the 
connection between you and the sing-
ing group ABBA. 
Now, Ingmar Bergman is one of the 
greatest film directors of all time. 
ABBA, a Swedish singing group, is, I 
think, maybe the top-selling singing 
group in the history of the world. They 
actually still record from time to time. 
But, anyway, I said to Queen Silvia: 
Is there any connection between ABBA 
and you and your husband? Is there? 
She said: Well, there is. 
I said: Well, what is it? 
And she said: The night before we 
were married in Sweden, there was a 
huge celebration and a concert, an out-
door concert, with tens of thousands of 
people. 
She said: The headline group for the 
concert was ABBA. 
I said: No kidding? Did they sing? 
And she said: That was the night 
they 
debuted 
the 
song 
‘‘Dancing 
Queen.’’ 
It is, maybe, one of the best pop 
songs I have ever heard. I won’t say 
that we sat there and hummed a few 
bars, but maybe we did. 
We have a lot in common with the 
Swedes and the Finns. We share a lot of 
likes and, really, very much apprecia-
tion, if you will, of the arts and of film, 
including music. We are a country that 
prides itself on our free enterprise sys-
tem, but we know how to do it with a 
heart. So do the Swedes. 
Look up the term ‘‘no-brainer.’’ You 
won’t find it in the dictionary, but if 
you look up the term ‘‘no-brainer,’’ it 
would say: this vote today and the 
issue that is before us. 
Why in God’s name wouldn’t we want 
the Swedes and Finns to join us to-
gether? 
LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER is our Con-
gresswoman. We have only one. She is 
our Congresswoman. In Delaware, she 
has a saying that she talks about: 
Sticks tied together can’t be broken. 
Sticks tied together can’t be broken. 
With one stick—phew—you are going 
to break it; but if you pile a bunch of 
them together, you can’t break them. 
The same is true here. The same is true 
here. The admission of Finland and the 
admission of Sweden into NATO makes 
that band of sticks even stronger and 
that much harder to break. 
I am just delighted that we have an 
issue where there has been a fair 
amount of dissension in these Halls, 
and I am delighted that we have some-
thing, I think, we can all pretty 
much—almost all—agree on. It is a 
good thing, and it will be good for our 
country. It is going to be good for Swe-
den, and it is going to be good for Fin-
land. I think it is going to be good for 
our planet. Those of us who are privi-
leged to live in what used to be the col-
ony of New Sweden couldn’t be happier, 
and we are delighted to celebrate. 
To anybody who is listening who 
says: Well, you know, I have never been 
to a national park in Delaware, well, 
we want you to know that we have one 
and that it is a great one that runs 
from one end of the State to the other. 
If you start up north, get off the train 
and walk about a mile, you will be at 
what used to be the home place, the 
starting place, of the colony of New 
Sweden. 
With that, I think I have done 
enough damage here today. I yield to 
the fellow from Alaska. I don’t know if 
he has spent a lot of time on ships or 
boats. I spent a few years as a Navy 
guy, but the marines spend a lot of 
time at sea. They take rides in our 
boats. We are on the same team. I usu-
ally say we wear different uniforms, 
but we are on the same team. 
And, on this, we are on the same 
page, and it is great to be here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, it 
is always good to follow my friend from 
Delaware, Navy Captain CARPER, who 
is a Vietnam vet, a naval aviator—the 
whole works. It is an honor to serve 
with him on the EPW and other com-
mittees. So thank you to my good 
friend from Delaware. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5192 
Madam President, I call up my 
amendment No. 5192 and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Alaska [Mr. SULLIVAN] 
proposes an amendment numbered 5192. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To provide a declaration to the 
Protocol) 
In section 2, strike paragraph (6) and insert 
the following: 
(6) SUPPORT FOR 2014 WALES SUMMIT DEFENSE 
SPENDING BENCHMARK.—The Senate declares 
that all NATO members should spend a min-
imum of 2 percent of their Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) on defense and 20 percent of 
their defense budgets on major equipment, 
including research and development, by 2024, 
as outlined in the 2014 Wales Summit Dec-
laration. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
after World War II, European leaders 
looked to the United States to help 
heal a fractured world and to help pro-
vide safety against increasing com-
munist Russian aggression. As Winston 
Churchill said: 
There I sat with the great Russian bear on 
one side of me with paws outstretched and, 
on the other side, the great American Buf-
falo. 
Well, the Buffalo prevailed, NATO 
prevailed, and the world’s most suc-
cessful and enduring military alliance 
was born. 
In 1949, the Senate ratified the NATO 
treaty by a vote of 82 to 13. President 
Truman was quoted at the signing 
ceremony of the NATO treaty by say-
ing: 
In this pact, we hope to create a shield 
against aggression and the fear of aggression 
. . . For us, war is not inevitable. 
He continued: 
Men with courage and vision can still de-
termine their own destiny. They can choose 
slavery or freedom—war or peace. . . . The 
treaty we are signing here today is evidence 
of the path they will follow. 
That was when President Truman 
signed the first NATO treaty. 
And, indeed, since the formation of 
NATO, no world wars have broken out, 
no country that is a signatory of NATO

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

August 3, 2022 
has been invaded by another country’s 
military forces. In fact, the only time 
NATO’s article V—which is the pillar 
of the alliance, which states that an at-
tack on one is an attack on all—was in-
voked was actually after the terrorist 
attacks on America on 9/11. Our allies 
came to our help to ensure Afghanistan 
wouldn’t harbor terrorists, and we ap-
preciate that help. We appreciate it 
deeply from our NATO allies. 
NATO, however, is more than just a 
military alliance. It is a group of coun-
tries with shared values and beliefs and 
a commitment to the principles of de-
mocracy. All of this, in addition to the 
military alliance, is the heritage of 
NATO. 
President Ronald Reagan summed it 
up succinctly in a speech to our NATO 
allies in 1983: 
What do the Soviets mean by words like 
democracy, freedom, and peace? Not, I’m 
sorry to say, what we mean. 
Replace the word ‘‘Soviet’’ with 
‘‘Russia,’’ and the sentiment, unfortu-
nately, holds true today. We see the 
antithesis of these democratic values 
and shared beliefs of NATO being 
played out in real time before us in the 
streets of Ukraine, where Vladimir 
Putin is leading a brutal assault on 
Ukraine—Russia’s democratic neigh-
bor—and committing atrocities, hor-
rible atrocities, against the brave peo-
ple of that country. 
As 
both 
Presidents 
Truman 
and 
Reagan remarked, members of the 
NATO alliance are like members of the 
same house in the same family—the 
house and the family of democracy. 
So, today, the U.S. Senate will wel-
come the nations of Sweden and Fin-
land into the NATO family. Like any 
family, we may not agree on every-
thing, but when it is most important, 
we will have each other’s back. That is 
the essence of NATO and the core rea-
son for its success. 
Neither Russia nor any other country 
will be able to invade Sweden or Fin-
land, now that they have become mem-
bers of NATO, without its NATO allies 
coming to their support. 
Of course, Finland has experienced 
the Russian invasion. In 1939, where, 
without the help from other nations, 
its greatly outnumbered brave Finnish 
army fought off over 1 million Russian 
forces for 3 months. But that won’t 
happen again to Finland. It won’t hap-
pen to Sweden. They won’t be alone 
now. 
We welcome these countries’ com-
mitment to freedom and their ad-
vanced professional militaries, which 
will make NATO stronger. 
To Finland and Sweden, no longer 
will you be working with NATO. You 
will now be working in and part of the 
greatest defense alliance in history. So 
welcome to these great countries. 
As Churchill once said: 
There is only one thing worse than fight-
ing with allies, and that is fighting without 
them! 
I strongly support the inclusion of 
these two great nations, Sweden and 
Finland, into the NATO alliance. Im-
portant occasions like this are also an 
opportunity to reflect on the obliga-
tions of membership, not just for these 
new NATO members but for all NATO 
members. 
And on the heels of the Russian inva-
sion and annexation of Crimea in 2014, 
the heads of state and representatives 
of the then-28 member countries who 
made up NATO attended a very impor-
tant summit, a NATO summit, in 
Wales. There, they agreed upon a com-
mon goal for all NATO members that 
they would spend a minimum of 2 per-
cent of their gross domestic product on 
defense by 2024. This 2 percent of GDP 
NATO defense spending goal has been 
strongly supported for decades by 
American administrations, both Re-
publican and Democratic: Presidents 
Bush, Obama, Trump, and now Presi-
dent Biden. 
At the time, in 2014, of the NATO 
summit in Wales, 10 of the 28 members 
of NATO met that 2-percent guideline. 
Now, 8 years later in 2022, of the 30 
NATO country members, we only have 
8 of those 30 meeting that 2-percent 
threshold. 
I have a chart here. It lays out the 2- 
percent goal: who is above it, who is 
below it. It is many other countries be-
sides the ones that are listed there. But 
the bottom line is, since Wales and 
that important commitment, there has 
not been much progress in NATO on 
this shared goal and commitment. 
Now, I am a very strong supporter of 
NATO and a very strong supporter of 
the U.S. military, and I want NATO to 
endure for decades to come. But alli-
ances can’t endure if shared commit-
ments and shared burdens are not met. 
This is particularly true for democratic 
alliances like NATO. There must be a 
sense among the citizens of such coun-
tries that all are pulling their weight 
for the collective defense of the alli-
ance, for the collective defense of each 
other. 
So as I mentioned at the outset, I am 
calling up an amendment to the resolu-
tion. My amendment is to make this 
commitment clear. It is to announce 
the U.S. Senate’s expectation for all 
NATO members: the United States, ex-
isting members, and now new mem-
bers—expectations on what has already 
been agreed to by each NATO country 
and its citizens. 
The amendment is simple. It states 
the following: 
The Senate declares that all NATO mem-
bers should spend a minimum of 2 percent of 
their Gross Domestic Product . . . on defense 
and 20 percent of their defense budget on 
major equipment, including research and de-
velopment, by 2024, as outlined in the 2014 
Wales Summit Declaration. 
That is it. It is a simple amendment, 
and I hope it can pass in the next hour 
by voice vote. 
Let me conclude with this: A robust, 
expanded NATO with Finland and Swe-
den as new members is needed now 
more than ever, especially given the 
brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russia. 
We need to fully understand the broad-
er implications of this invasion. We 
have entered a new era of authori-
tarian aggression, led by Russia and 
China’s dictators, who are increasingly 
isolated and dangerous, driven by his-
torical 
grievances, 
paranoid 
about 
their democratic neighbors, and willing 
to use military force and other aggres-
sive actions to crush the citizens of 
such countries. These dangerous dic-
tators, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, 
are increasingly working together to 
achieve their aggressive goals. 
We must wake up to the fact that 
this new era of authoritarian aggres-
sion will likely be with us for decades. 
We need to face it with strategic re-
solve 
and 
confidence. 
The 
United 
States has extraordinary advantages 
relative to the dictatorships of Russia 
and China, if we are wise enough to uti-
lize and strengthen them: our global 
network of allies, our lethal military, 
our world-class supplies of energy and 
other natural resources, our dynamic 
economy, and, most important, our 
democratic values and commitment to 
liberty. 
Xi Jinping and Putin’s biggest weak-
ness and vulnerability is that they fear 
their own people. We should remember 
this and exploit this in the months and 
years ahead. NATO, as an alliance, en-
compasses so many of these powerful 
comparative advantages: a lethal mili-
tary, a global network of allies, dy-
namic economies, and the power of 
democratic values and the commit-
ment to liberty. 
We should all welcome and celebrate 
the addition of Finland and Sweden to 
the NATO alliance, but we should also 
use this moment to recognize the seri-
ousness of the authoritarian threats on 
the rise all over the world and recom-
mit ourselves, all NATO members, to 
our obligations of collective defense, 
moving forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first 
of all, I want to applaud the Senator 
from Alaska for his comments. I agree 
completely with his statements, and I 
think his amendment making it clear 
that we expect the 2 percent to be hon-
ored by all member states is something 
that we all should welcome and agree 
to. 
I thank you for your leadership. I 
also thank you for how you have ar-
ticulated the importance of NATO to 
our national security. 
NATO is a transatlantic security 
partnership that has served our na-
tional security interests so well for so 
many years since the end of World War 
II. 
Today, we are going to have a chance 
to vote to expand the NATO alliance by 
adding Finland and Sweden. I hope all 
my colleagues will support that. 
I will point out that Finland already 
exceeds the 2 percent that Senator

August 3, 2022 
SULLIVAN is talking about, the percent-
age of their GDP that they are spend-
ing on defense. So I think this is an-
other reason why we have countries 
that we want to add to the alliance. We 
have 30 strong now. This will even be 
stronger with Finland and Sweden 
being added to the NATO alliance. 
But what is unique about the two 
countries that we will have a chance to 
vote on in a few moments is that they 
give us added value to our alliance. 
They make our alliance stronger. It is 
in our national security interest to in-
clude Finland and Sweden. They add 
value militarily and economically to 
this alliance. 
The geostrategic location of these 
two countries is critically important to 
our national security. Just think for a 
moment about the threats to the Bal-
tic nations that we have seen by Rus-
sia—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. 
Think about where Poland has been 
threatened because of Russia’s aggres-
sion in Ukraine. 
Adding Finland and Sweden will help 
us round out the security alliance nec-
essary to provide the security that we 
need. Both of these countries are al-
ready committed to interoperability 
with the NATO alliance. They are al-
ready familiar with how NATO’s proc-
ess and procedures are utilized. 
So we have two countries that are 
ready from day one to be active par-
ticipants in the alliance. They both 
participate in regular participation 
and training exercises with NATO and 
U.S. forces. Both Sweden and Finland 
have done that. They have contributed 
troops. Sweden has contributed troops 
to NATO-led operations in Kosovo, to 
Afghanistan, to Iraq. So we have coun-
tries that have already stepped up to 
help us in security and now will be a 
formal part of the security alliance. 
They will add, also, a dimension that 
is important for us in regards to winter 
warfare. The cold response winter war-
fare exercises have been participated 
in. Finland has the arctic capabilities 
that will be critically important to us 
as we move forward. So we are adding 
value to the NATO alliance as well as 
expanding the number of countries. 
I want to mention one other area: 
cyber and misinformation. We have 
two countries that have been very ac-
tive in being victimized by the misin-
formation campaign by Russia. Sweden 
has a Psychological Defence Agency 
that they created in 2016 that is going 
to be important for us. As we know, 
Mr. Putin uses every weapon in his ar-
senal, including misinformation, in 
order to try to bring down democratic 
states. We know that in Sweden’s case, 
they are already taking decisive action 
to counter the misinformation. Finland 
has an anti-fake-news initiative, which 
is actually fascinating. They recognize 
that Russia is trying to invade their 
country through misinformation, and 
they have an active way of defending 
against it. So, as I said earlier, we have 
two countries that will add value to 
the alliance. 
The timing here couldn’t be better. 
We have stood up an international re-
solve to support Ukraine in the inva-
sion by Russia. Expanding NATO at 
this moment is a clear message to Mr. 
Putin that we stand with the demo-
cratic countries of Europe and we are 
prepared to expand our NATO alliance 
to guarantee their protection. 
So these two stalwart, democratic 
nations, Finland and Sweden, have 
been robust partners to the United 
States and Europe on countless fronts. 
They have provided humanitarian aid 
to many countries in need, including 
Ukraine during the unprovoked inva-
sion by Russia. Combined, Finland and 
Sweden provided over $120 million in 
military 
and 
humanitarian 
aid 
to 
Ukraine between February and June of 
2022. 
These two nations have also shown a 
commitment to democratic govern-
ance, ranking third and fourth respec-
tively on the global Democracy Index 
of 2020, according to an economist 
group. So we have two of the leading 
democratic states. 
Finland and Sweden have proven 
time and time again that they have the 
defense capabilities and commitment 
to democracy in Europe to make them 
essential NATO allies. The Senate 
must act now to bolster this global 
peace and security by voting in favor of 
Finland and Sweden’s accession to the 
North Atlantic Treaty. I urge my col-
leagues to do that. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Madam President, I would ask that I 
be permitted to enter comments about 
the 1-year anniversary of the fall of Af-
ghanistan, pointing out that the Biden 
administration has been able to assist 
in the evacuation of so many American 
citizens and people who helped our U.S. 
mission, those who were involved in 
the democratic reforms in that coun-
try, but there is still a mission that we 
need to participate in to save people. 
So I would ask unanimous consent 
that those comments be printed in a 
separate part of the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARDIN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the fol-
lowing Senators be permitted to speak

GRAHAM for up to 5 minutes, Senator 
BLUNT for up to 5 minutes, Senator

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATO 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
rise in strong support of the accession 
of Finland and Sweden into the NATO 
alliance. 
In May, I visited Helsinki and Stock-
holm as part of a Senate delegation to 
encourage the Finnish and Swedish ef-
forts to join the alliance. Our trip, 
however, started in Ukraine. There, 
after a long, secret journey under cover 
of darkness, our contingent of four 
Senators 
met 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy for 2 hours. We discussed the 
military, humanitarian, economic, and 
security 
consequences 
of 
Russia’s 
unprovoked, 
brutal 
war 
against 
Ukraine. I asked President Zelenskyy 
whether he thought Vladimir Putin’s 
attack on his country had had the op-
posite effect of what he had intended. 
For example, the Russian-speaking sec-
tions of eastern Ukraine are now em-
bracing their Ukrainian identity, and 
NATO is more united than ever. Presi-
dent Zelenskyy told me that Putin’s 
war of aggression not only had been 
the opposite of the easy conquest that 
Putin 
had 
expected 
but 
also 
had 
strengthened the NATO alliance and 
the European Union. 
(Mr. HICKENLOOPER assumed the 
Chair.) 
Mr. President, one cannot understand 
how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has 
upended decades and, in the case of 
Sweden, centuries of security policy for 
these countries. For 200 years, Sweden 
has maintained a policy of neutrality, 
but, 
as 
Swedish 
Prime 
Minister 
Andersson put it to me, ‘‘February 24 
changed everything.’’ That was the 
date 
of 
the 
Russian 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. 
Finland, which shares an 830-mile 
border with Russia, likewise concluded 
that Russia’s aggression required a 
dramatic rethinking of its security. To 
demonstrate the reality on the ground, 
the Finnish President took us outside 
of his home and pointed to his right, 
where Tallinn, Estonia, is only 50 miles 
away across the Baltic Sea. He then 
pointed to his left and told us that St. 
Petersburg, Russia, is only 200 miles 
away. 
Our visits to these leaders came just 
as the Parliaments of Finland and Swe-
den were voting to formally request ad-
mission into NATO. We assured their 
leaders that there was strong, bipar-
tisan support in the Senate for their 
accession and that adding their capa-
bilities to the alliance would improve, 
would strengthen our collective defense 
and security. 
This is, indeed, an important point. 
Sweden and Finland will both bring 
enormous geographic advantages and 
military capabilities to NATO. Finland 
is expected to exceed NATO’s 2 percent 
defense spending target this year, and 
Sweden has committed to meeting that 
target as soon as possible. Finland has 
the largest reserve military force in 
Europe and has recently decided to up-
grade its current fleet of American F– 
18 fighter jets with the fifth-generation 
F–35. For the past several years, Swe-
den has been increasing its arms spend-
ing, and the country has advanced de-
fense industrial capabilities. 
The addition of both of these nations 
to 
NATO 
will 
bolster 
deterrence

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3895 
August 3, 2022 
For decades, Finland and Sweden 
have had a strong history of support 
for NATO. Their advanced militaries 
are, for example, interoperable with 
member nations. Both countries also 
have supported NATO-led operations 
over the decades, including in Afghani-
stan, Kosovo, and Iraq. They fre-
quently participate in alliance-led ex-
ercises 
and 
capacity-building 
oper-
ations in Africa and elsewhere. 
During the current crisis in Ukraine, 
Finland and Sweden have been invalu-
able partners to the Ukrainians. They 
have been sending vital military aid to 
Ukraine, as well as humanitarian as-
sistance, 
since 
February, 
including 
anti-ship missiles, rifles, body armor, 
and anti-tank weapons. 
There are a few critics who contend 
that this NATO expansion, which will 
more than double NATO’s direct border 
with Russia, is somehow provocative to 
Vladimir Putin. This assertion ignores 
a clear pattern of Russian aggression 
extending back years. 
In 2008, Russia invaded its neighbor, 
Georgia. 
In 
2014, 
Russia 
invaded 
Ukraine for the first time, occupying 
and seizing Crimea and areas of eastern 
Ukraine. Then, earlier this year, of 
course, Russia launched the largest and 
most devastating land war in Europe 
since World War II without any jus-
tification or provocation when it in-
vaded the free and democratic nation 
of Ukraine. 
This expansion of NATO is warranted 
precisely because of Russian provo-
cations across the region. 
As always, NATO and the United 
States have no desire to see a war with 
Russia, but we will defend the territory 
and sovereignty of each of its members. 
Russia’s brutal and unprovoked inva-
sion 
of 
Ukraine 
has 
permanently 
changed the European security envi-
ronment. Enlarging NATO to include 
two of our most capable and supportive 
European allies, Finland and Sweden, 
is a necessary and deliberative re-
sponse. 
I urge all of my colleagues, in a 
strong vote, to join me in the swift 
ratification of Finland and Sweden’s 
accession into NATO. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, one, I 
want to associate myself with the com-
ments of Senator COLLINS from Maine. 
That was a great story about why we 
should all be happy today with Finland 
and Sweden and why this makes a lot 
of sense. 
There is one person I want to thank 
whom I don’t usually give a big shout- 
out to: President Putin from Russia. 
Without you, we wouldn’t be here. You 
have done more to strengthen NATO 
than any speech I could ever hope to 
give. 
John McCain, I wish you were alive 
today to celebrate because what we 
have been able to accomplish here 
through Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is 
to remind everybody in the world, 
when it comes to bullies, you better 
stand up to them before it is too late. 
So our friends in Finland and Sweden 
have decided to join NATO. That is a 
good thing. 
But let me put Ukraine in perspec-
tive right quick. Our military leaders 
and our experts told us: After the inva-
sion, 4 days, they would be in Kyiv. 
Well, they miscalculated. They over-
estimated the capabilities of the Rus-
sians, and they certainly undercal-
culated the resolve of the Ukrainian 
people. 
We are 160 days into this fight. 
Ukraine is still standing, bloodied but 
unbowed; NATO is bigger; crippling 
sanctions on the Russian economy; the 
ICC is investigating war crimes com-
mitted by Putin and his cronies. You 
have 100 U.S. Senators—we can’t agree 
on Sunday being a day off—have agreed 
that Russia should be a State sponsor 
of terrorism under U.S. law. 
So 160 days into this fight, I am tell-
ing you right now, things are looking 
pretty good for the good guys. And I 
say that knowing how much suffering 
has gone on in the Ukraine. But today, 
we are here to admit two new members 
of NATO. 
NATO has been the strongest force 
for good, I think, on the planet since 
1949. It is a group of countries orga-
nized around democratic concepts that 
have pledged to one another mutual de-
fense—an attack on one is an attack on 
all. It has deterred war. It has been a 
stabilizing influence in Europe since 
the end of World War II. And along 
comes Putin. 
So NATO today is going to be bigger 
than it was before the invasion. NATO 
today is going to have more military 
resources than before the invasion by 
Russia into Ukraine. 
Again, I want to thank President 
Putin. You have done something for 
the democratic world that we have not 
been able to do for ourselves. 
To NATO, as an organization, keep 
your eye on the ball; pay your 2 per-
cent. 
To my friends who suggest that ex-
panding 
NATO 
makes 
us 
weaker 
against China, what movie are you 
watching? How can you believe for one 
moment abandoning Ukraine or show-
ing less of a commitment to European 
stability will make China more afraid 
of us and less likely to invade Taiwan? 
The best thing we could do right now 
as a world—particularly, the demo-
cratic world—is to become stronger in 
the face of aggression, to make NATO 
bigger. And we are going to accomplish 
that in a few minutes. 
To all my colleagues who have come 
down here and spoken on behalf of the 
admission of these two countries, God 
bless you; you are on the right side of 
history. 
One regret I do have is my great 
friend Senator McCain could not see 
today come about because he would be 
exceedingly pleased that the demo-
cratic world has rallied in the face of 
the aggression by Putin. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
join my colleagues in my appreciation 
for the expansion of NATO—as others 
have said, the greatest alliance, maybe 
in history, certainly in the last 200 
years, an alliance that has served great 
benefits and now is growing. NATO has 
been there since 1949. 
The two countries that we are going 
to be voting to admit today have re-
sisted since 1949 being part of NATO, 
but with the recent actions, they de-
cided you now have to choose a side. 
Now, they are not countries that 
have been on the sideline just hoping 
nothing would happen. They are coun-
tries that had significant defense ca-
pacities, significant military capabili-
ties. They will be net security contrib-
utors to NATO. They bring to the alli-
ance these advanced capabilities. They 
bring a neighborhood understanding of 
Russia, greater than maybe almost any 
other country, particularly Finland, 
which has been mentioned has an 800- 
plus mile border that will double the 
NATO border with Russia. They have 
been defending that border since World 
War II, and the Russians understand 
their capacity to defend it. 
They, frankly, bring good real estate 
and good location. I wish I had a map 
here on the floor with me, but I don’t. 
The Baltic really becomes a NATO sea. 
And that is an important thing—Nor-
way already in NATO, Sweden joining 
NATO, Finland joining NATO; right 
across from the three Baltic countries 
that are much more in need of assist-
ance than these two countries that are 
joining an alliance that will give them 
that assistance. It is an incredible day 
for NATO. 
The Baltic Sea, the Arctic—I have 
heard more on this floor and in this 
country about the Arctic in the last 5 
years than I think we have talked 
about in the previous 25 years. The 
Arctic basically becomes NATO terri-
tory with the sole exception of Russia. 
The United States, Canada, Norway, 
Sweden, Finland become the countries 
that are bound not only in the neigh-
borhood of the Arctic but also in a sup-
portive alliance. 
We have been hearing about how 
China wants to become an Arctic 
power. I think the change in NATO 
makes it incredibly harder for China to 
become an Arctic power or for Russia 
to become an Arctic abuser. And we are 
seeing that happen right here. 
Again, great capability. The Swedes 
have an Air Force, a Navy. They have 
the best cyber offensive and defensive 
capability in Europe—that large indus-
trial base. Finland just agreed to buy 
64 F–35s to replace their F–18s. 
Both countries have been working 
with us in military exercises for years. 
They are virtually immediately inter-
operable. They bring capacity to the 
NATO alliance that it doesn’t have 
without them. 
I am grateful that they are joining. 
Finland is already at the 2 percent goal

of their commitment to their own na-
tional defense. Sweden will be there by 
2028. 
Senator DURBIN, who is here on the 
floor with me, and I met with both of 
these countries recently. And they are 
absolutely committed that this is the 
moment when the NATO alliance takes 
on new meaning, not only to their two 
countries but I think to—and not only 
Western Europe but, frankly, to the 
world. 
This is an alliance that stands for 
shared values, that stands for border 
integrity, that stands for being sure 
that those things go into the future. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote for 
this today. I am glad we are able to be 
among the first. We were hoping we 
would be the first country to approve 
the admission into NATO of these two 
countries, but we will be among the 
first. I think it sends a signal to the 
world and hopefully to all Americans 
that not only is NATO important, but 
it will be stronger with Sweden and 
Finland than it has ever been. And I 
look forward to the opportunity to cast 
this vote today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to oppose the Paul amendment to the 
resolution of advice and consent to 
ratification for the extension of the Re-
public of Finland and the Kingdom of 
Sweden to NATO. 
Like virtually all of my colleagues, I 
support the admission of Sweden and 
Finland into NATO. Their commitment 
to democracy, their military capabili-
ties, and their resolve in the face of 
Russian aggression is welcome. 
With Russia’s unprovoked attack on 
Ukraine, NATO has been united in pro-
viding support for the Ukrainians to 
defend themselves. NATO is also united 
in its adherence to the revisions of the 
NATO treaty. The world is watching to 
see if there are any cracks in that com-
mitment, particularly with respect to 
its provisions for mutual defense. 
We must not in any way appear to be 
going wobbly on article 5. I fear that 
the Paul amendment would do just 
that. Further, Senator PAUL’s amend-
ment is unnecessary. The NATO treaty 
specifically states this: 
This Treaty shall be ratified and its provi-
sions carried out by the Parties in accord-
ance with their respective constitutional 
processes. 
That is in the NATO treaty itself. 
So adding the language of the Paul 
amendment would only add confusion 
and potentially communicate to the 
world that this body seeks something 
in addition to the adherence to the 
constitutional process that the treaty 
already requires. 
Now, it is well and good for Congress 
to consider war powers and our role in 
military conflicts. But doing so as part 
of the accession of Sweden and Finland 
to NATO while Ukraine is under attack 
and while Russia may potentially be 
eyeing violence against NATO nations 
is surely not the time. 
Our commitment to NATO and arti-
cle 5 must be clear and unambiguous. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, the 
United States has not once ratified 
NATO protocols with a reservation. 
I am going to say that again to make 
sure I got it right. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, the 
United States has not once ratified 
NATO protocols with a reservation. 
Now should be no different. Doing so 
could send the wrong message to the 
people of Ukraine, to our other friends 
and allies. It could even be propa-
gandized as a nod to Putin. 
I urge my colleagues to vote down 
Senator PAUL’s amendment. Our mes-
sage must be clear: We stand with 
NATO, with article 5, and with the ad-
mission of Finland and Sweden into 
our alliance. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 5 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I hope 
that my remarks are even less. 
I stand in solid support of the acces-
sion of Finland and Sweden into NATO. 
Just a few weeks ago, I was fortunate 
enough to visit Lithuania. It is a coun-
try that means a lot to me and my 
family. I met with the former Presi-
dent Valdas Adamkus. 
Adamkus, a Lithuanian immigrant 
to the United States, had a distin-
guished record in our government’s 
service here and then returned to Lith-
uania after his retirement from the 
U.S. Federal Government and ran suc-
cessfully for President. 
He had the vision to realize that the 
future of Lithuania and the Baltic 
States was in the European Union and 
NATO 
and 
worked 
strenuously 
to 
achieve those goals, and I was happy to 
be joining him in that effort. 
Now, this moment in history really 
complements his leadership because 
the accession of Finland and Sweden to 
NATO is a confirmation that the Baltic 
Sea is safer than ever when it comes to 
the West. If Vladimir Putin thought 
that by invading Ukraine he could 
somehow inhibit the future of NATO or 
in some way limit its future, the oppo-
site has occurred. 
NATO is stronger than ever. And the 
United States’ commitment to NATO 
is stronger than ever. The fact that 
only a handful of Senators from either 
political party are even questioning 
the accession of Sweden and Finland 
are good indications to me that we 
have bipartisan support for this NATO 
coalition now more than ever—and we 
should, first, for the Ukrainians and, 
secondly, for the United States and its 
future. 
Those who are speaking against the 
accession of Finland and Sweden sug-
gest that we ought to focus our atten-
tion on Asia. Well, we cannot ignore 
Asia. It is an important part of our 
near-term future. And we have got to 
show strength throughout the world. 
Why don’t we start right now? With 
this accession of Finland and Sweden, 
the strengthening of the NATO alliance 
says to any adversary of the United 
States, even to China and its future, 
that this country does business with 
other countries in the world on an 
arm’s-length basis and a respectful 
basis and can deal with democracies in 
a constructive way in building their 
economies for the future. 
I will gladly join in the support of 
the accession of Finland and Sweden to 
NATO. I believe it not only strengthens 
that alliance when it comes to this war 
in Ukraine, it prepares us for chal-
lenges in the future, and it is the right 
thing for America’s security. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today, I 
rise and urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of the Accession Protocols for 
Finland and Sweden to join NATO. 
This is probably one of the easiest 
votes I will ever make in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
I have listened to arguments about 
Asia, somehow that it comes in here. 
Look, we can walk and chew gum at 
the same time. Certainly, we need to 
look at what is going on in Asia, pay 
attention to what is going on in Asia, 
but what we are talking about here is 
the defense of the North Atlantic. 
This organization was put together 
many years ago. It has grown over 
those years to be 30-strong. And now 
we are going to add two more. 
I have characterized NATO as the 
most successful political and military 
alliance in the history of the world; 
certainly the most powerful alliance in 
the history of the world. And today we 
have the opportunity to expand the al-
liance by including Finland and Swe-
den. 
Over the years, we have added var-
ious countries, and debates could be 
had about those countries as to wheth-
er or not they are sufficient to join 
NATO and be part of the article 5 ‘‘an 
attack on one is an attack on all’’ alli-
ance. But on Finland and Sweden, 
there really is little, if any, argument. 
These are two very successful coun-
tries. 
This accession process is an impor-
tant chance for the United States to 
demonstrate leadership in NATO—we 
have over the years, and we will con-
tinue to do so—and the United States’ 
commitment to its modernization and 
to its future. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee has carefully consulted and co-
ordinated with our NATO allies, the 
Governments of Sweden and Finland, 
and with the administration to ensure 
this process could move as efficiently 
as possible. I can tell you that, person-
ally—and others have done the same 
over recent years and particularly over 
recent months, have pressed Finland 
and Sweden to change their view as to

August 3, 2022 
whether or not they should remain 
neutral and instead move into the 
NATO alliance. 
On February 24, we all know the 
world shook. Things changed dramati-
cally. After Putin’s unprovoked attack 
on Ukraine, Sweden and Finland, I am 
sure, woke up and said: You know, that 
could be us next, but it won’t be us if 
we join NATO. So their polling in their 
country changed dramatically on Feb-
ruary 24 as to whether or not NATO 
membership was appropriate for them. 
They have now enthusiastically said 
that NATO is appropriate for them, 
and we have shown in this body bipar-
tisan support for Finland and Sweden 
joining NATO. 
Finland and Sweden will make model 
members of the NATO alliance. Both 
have strong and capable militaries in 
place now and are already net contrib-
utors to the security alliance. As was 
pointed out earlier by Senator COLLINS 
here, they have been very active in 
NATO, even though they are not mem-
bers of NATO, by participating in var-
ious drills that have taken place and 
also by participating in the duties that 
NATO does strengthening the eastern 
flank of NATO. They have also dem-
onstrated interoperability with NATO, 
which is extremely important, and the 
commitment necessary to join the alli-
ance. 
I would say that today, with what is 
going on in Ukraine, Finland and Swe-
den joining the alliance is even more 
important. When the shooting is over 
in Ukraine, it won’t be over. NATO is 
going to reexamine what they need to 
do to strengthen themselves, and cer-
tainly one of those will be an examina-
tion of hardening the eastern flank. 
Finland and Sweden, obviously, are on 
the eastern flank and will add consider-
ably to that. Not only that, it is going 
to cost more to defend the eastern 
flank simply because of what Russia 
has done. Finland and Sweden will be a 
contributor, as will everybody. 
Adding these two nations as full 
members of our alliance will further 
deter any temptation by Russia to en-
gage in military adventurism in the 
Baltic and Arctic regions. I believe 
Russia is already deterred when we say 
and our NATO allies say and European 
nations say to Putin: Not one square 
inch. Whether it is on the eastern bor-
der of one of the Baltic States or 
whether it is downtown London or in 
the United States, an attack on any of 
the NATO countries is an attack on all 
of them, and the response will be swift. 
Today’s ratification of Finland and 
Sweden as new members of NATO will 
both send a strong message of trans-
atlantic unity to Putin and strengthen 
NATO against Russia’s ongoing threat. 
NATO has pulled together regionally to 
push back on Russia, and it is obvious 
that need has not gone away. 
I want to urge my colleagues to vote 
yes. This is a really easy vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5191 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today, the 
Senate will vote to expand the NATO 
alliance to include Sweden and Fin-
land. A crucial question that should be 
answered is whether Sweden and Fin-
land’s accession to NATO is in Amer-
ica’s best interests and whether their 
joining will cause more or less war. 
Well, for every action, there is a re-
action. What do our adversaries say? 
Putin’s immediate response to it was 
that Russia ‘‘does not have a problem’’ 
with Sweden or Finland applying for 
NATO but that ‘‘the expansion of mili-
tary infrastructure into this territory 
will of course give rise to reaction and 
response.’’ So from Russia’s perspec-
tive, they likely will tolerate Sweden 
and Finland in NATO but likely will 
not tolerate certain weapons systems 
in Finland or Sweden. 
Advocates of NATO expansion said 
we can’t be held hostage to Russia’s 
threats. Perhaps. But if a country an-
nounces they will do X if you do Y, 
shouldn’t 
someone 
at 
least 
con-
template the potential scenarios? The 
Russians have already announced that 
placing certain weapons systems in 
Finland is a redline. Whether the red-
line is justified is not the issue. The 
issue is, knowing your adversary’s po-
sition, is it worth the risk of pushing 
missiles into Finland? 
The world has changed since Putin 
invaded Ukraine. Arguments that ad-
mitting Sweden and Finland to NATO 
could provoke Russia are less potent 
now since Putin’s war shows he can be 
provoked by actions short of Ukraine’s 
actual admission to NATO. 
Diplomats, though, should try to en-
vision how the Ukraine war might end. 
One 
possible 
end 
would 
be, 
as 
Zelenskyy 
has 
stated, 
a 
neutral 
Ukraine not militarily aligned with ei-
ther the West or the East. Neutrality 
doesn’t have to always be a weakness. 
Neutral nations can serve as inter-
mediaries in conflict resolution. Often, 
our discussions with Iran use neutral 
Sweden as a conduit. When all nations 
are aligned, who will be the mediators? 
The world will soon lose the important 
roles played by a neutral Finland and 
Sweden. 
But Putin’s invasion in Ukraine has 
changed the world. In this new world, I 
am less adamant about preventing 
NATO’s expansion with Sweden and 
Finland, but I am still adamant about 
the reality that NATO’s expansion will 
come at a cost. 
I am here today to propose a reserva-
tion to ensure that this expansion will 
not come at the expense of losing our 
ability to determine where and when 
the United States goes to war. My res-
ervation merely reasserts that article 5 
of the NATO treaty does not supersede 
Congress’s 
constitutional 
responsi-
bility to declare war before the United 
States commits troops to war. 
The Founders designed the separa-
tion of war powers to ensure that the 
decision to engage in hostilities would 
be made only after serious delibera-
tion. According to our Constitution, 
the United States would resort to war 
only after the collective wisdom of the 
people’s elected representatives deter-
mine war is in the best interest. We 
know this because our Founders told us 
so. 
At the Pennsylvania ratifying con-
vention, James Wilson stated that the 
proposed Constitution would not allow 
one man or even one body of men to de-
clare war. 
In Federalist No. 69, Alexander Ham-
ilton explained that the President 
would be restricted to conducting the 
armies and navies, which Congress 
alone would raise and fund. 
The Father of our Constitution, 
James Madison, argued: 
In no part of the Constitution is more wis-
dom to be found than in the clause which 
confides the question of war or peace to the 
legislature. 
Some have argued that a vote for my 
amendment is to go wobbly on NATO’s 
article 5 commitment. I would argue 
that the Gold Star parents and our men 
and women in the field don’t want Con-
gress to go wobbly on the Constitution. 
There is no more serious question 
that we are entrusted to answer than 
whether to commit the men and 
women of the armed services to war. 
We cannot delegate that responsibility 
to the President, to the courts, to an 
international body, or to our allies. 
This is our constitutional responsi-
bility, one that we have freely taken 
and one that our constituents expect us 
to uphold. 
I also want to assure my colleagues 
here that adoption of my reservation 
will not jeopardize the NATO treaty. 
Some will argue that while the sub-
stance 
of 
my 
reservation 
is 
unobjectionable, the process of adopt-
ing the reservation threatens the ex-
pansion of NATO. Nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth. 
It is true that reservations must be 
accepted by the other parties, but the 
other parties are NATO allies. The 
other parties are NATO allies who are 
all dependent on us to come to their 
rescue. Do you think they are going to 
lecture us on obeying our own Con-
stitution? We should expect those al-
lies to respect article 11 of the NATO 
treaty, which states that the provi-
sions of the treaty are to be carried out 
in accordance with each country’s re-
spective constitutional process. 
Additionally, my reservation does 
not require any other country to take 
action or renegotiate the treaty. The 
reservation will be deemed accepted if 
our allies do not object after a period 
of 12 months. 
I call on my colleagues to support my 
proposal to reaffirm that our Constitu-
tion and the NATO treaty are abun-
dantly clear: Our international obliga-
tions do not supersede Congress’s re-
sponsibility to declare war. It is in our 
Constitution. It is the supreme law of 
the land, and we should today reassert 
that we will obey the Constitution 
above all else.

TION’’. 
In section 1, strike ‘‘declarations of section

At the end, add the following: 
SEC. 4. RESERVATION. 
The advice and consent of the Senate 
under section 1 is subject to the following 
reservation: Article 5 of the North Atlantic 
Treaty does not supersede the constitutional 
requirement that Congress declare war be-
fore the United States engages in war. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as 
we bring to an end this debate about 
the accession treaty for Sweden and 
Finland, I have been listening in my of-
fice to my colleagues’ comments, and I 
think it has all been very constructive. 
But I do have a different view—a view 
on some points that have been made 
that I think are wrong—and before this 
body casts a vote, I think they should 
understand why. 
I appreciate Senator PAUL’s focus on 
Congress’s prerogatives with respect to 
war powers. Like Senator PAUL, I have 
a deep respect for the critical role that 
the Constitution assigns to Congress in 
this area, and I believe our democracy 
is stronger for it. But I rise to convey 
that Senator PAUL’s amendment is un-
necessary, 
unprecedented, 
and, 
if 
adopted, will be deeply damaging to 
NATO and our relationship with NATO 
allies. 
That is why the Foreign Relations 
Committee, in marking up these trea-
ties, overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan 
vote, voted down a substantively iden-
tical amendment offered by Senator 
PAUL. 
The amendment before us today is 
not necessary. There is no question 
that the North Atlantic Treaty and the 
Finland and Sweden protocols do not 
and cannot supersede the Constitution. 
No treaty can. This is a well-estab-
lished and well-understood point that 
the Supreme Court has reaffirmed. 
The amendment, however, would be 
deeply damaging to our core national 
security interests. Neither the United 
States nor any other NATO ally has 
ever insisted on a reservation—a state-
ment that would limit and call into 
question our adherence to NATO obli-
gations. But that is exactly what this 
amendment does. 
If adopted, it would be shared with 
all NATO members and would signal to 
them that we are limiting our obliga-
tions to NATO with regard to article 5 
of the NATO treaty. If we go down this 
road, we can expect that other coun-
tries will do so, as well, gutting the 
core commitment that NATO members 
make to each other. 
Particularly 
at 
this 
time, 
with 
Putin’s rampage in Ukraine, his energy 
war against Europe, and his constant 
saber-rattling, it would be self-defeat-
ing to do anything that casts doubt on 
our rock-solid commitment to NATO 
and our NATO allies. 
So let me reiterate: There is no ques-
tion that neither the treaties we are 
voting on today nor any treaty can su-
persede the Constitution. That position 
is clear in law and clear in logic: The 
Constitution is supreme. 
From there, we have one task before 
us: providing advice and consent to 
Finland and Sweden’s accession in a 
manner that strengthens the NATO al-
liance and strengthens our allies. The 
amendment before us would do the op-
posite. 
And for those reasons, I oppose that 
amendment and urge all my colleagues 
to do so as well. 
Finally, let me address some of the 
other critics of Sweden and Finland’s 
accession to the NATO alliance. Each 
day we fail to act we send a message of 
indecision and division. Some Repub-
lican critics oppose Sweden and Fin-
land joining NATO because they are 
worried about the cost to the United 
States, but that is simply untrue. Swe-
den and Finland will reduce these 
costs. 
Instead, we should be asking: What is 
the cost of delaying NATO expansion? 
What is the cost of debating protection 
for Europe’s democracies? What is the 
cost of denying security to Sweden and 
Finland? 
I will tell you, these eleventh-hour 
concerns standing in the way of this 
process only serve Putin’s interest. 
Other critics want an amendment un-
dermining article 5 of the NATO char-
ter, which says an attack on one NATO 
member is an attack on all. But as I 
said before, this was overwhelmingly 
rejected by both sides of the aisle in 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. 
And then there are still others who 
say we shouldn’t accept Sweden and 
Finland into NATO because China, not 
Russia, is our greatest foreign policy 
threat. Let me just say one thing, if 
you want to make sure you defeat the 
China challenge, the first thing you 
want to do is defeat Russia in Ukraine. 
Xi Jinping is looking at what is hap-
pening in Ukraine. He is looking at 
what the West is doing in Ukraine. And 
he is making calculations as it relates 
to Taiwan and elsewhere in the world. 
You want to make sure that you defeat 
Russia in Ukraine. 
And let me also say, as someone who 
has worked on foreign policy for three 
decades and who is intimately aware of 
the danger and risk that China poses, 
we have to be able to meet that chal-
lenge in multiple dimensions. Some-
times we face more than one threat at 
the same time. Sometimes our values 
and commitments compel us to stand 
up for what we believe in, and this is 
one of those times. Putin’s regime con-
tinues to push and probe for weakness, 
and NATO is the best institution we 
have to check his push for power across 
the continent. 
Over the course of the last 70 years 
that NATO has existed, it has used an 
open-door policy when it comes to ac-
cepting new member countries. These 
countries must be functioning democ-
racies. They must treat minorities fair-
ly. They must resolve conflicts peace-
fully and be able to contribute to the 
NATO alliance. And this criteria de-
scribes Sweden and Finland to a tee. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote yes 
to accept these prosperous democracies 
into NATO. Vote yes to reduce the cost 
on the United States and the entire 
military alliance. Vote yes to embrac-
ing the values and modern militaries of 
Sweden and Finland. Vote yes to hav-
ing these two democracies join us. Vote 
yes to strengthening the North Amer-
ican Treaty Organization today. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
Russia’s brutal and unprovoked war of 
choice 
against 
Ukraine 
has 
now 
reached its 5th month. But while Vladi-
mir Putin had hoped his war would di-
vide the Atlantic alliance, it has in 
fact brought us closer together. Today, 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion is stronger than ever, so strong in 
fact that new states are being brought 
into the fold. I am proud to vote today 
in favor of approving Finland and Swe-
den’s entry into NATO. Their member-
ship at this moment is critical to coun-
tering Putin’s threats to global secu-
rity—and especially to nearby, vulner-
able nations. As I have already stated 
publicly with the bipartisan members 
of the Senate NATO Observer Group, 
Finland and Sweden are longstanding 
security and economic partners who al-
ready share the collective values that 
guide our alliance, and I welcome the 
addition of these two highly capable 
countries—and the people of Finland 
and Sweden—to NATO. Their decision 
to join NATO further reveals how 
Putin has made a huge strategic blun-
der, further strengthening the bonds 
among democratic nations determined 
to resist his authoritarian reach. 
Ahead of this vote on adding Finland 
and Sweden to NATO, I would like to 
address Senator PAUL’s amendment re-
garding article 5 of the North Atlantic 
Treaty and the Constitution. Let’s be 
perfectly clear: There is no question 
that the protocols of any treaty do 
not—and cannot—supersede the provi-
sions of the U.S. Constitution. That 
premise has governed U.S. foreign pol-
icy since our founding. And it is in 
keeping with that long tradition of fi-
delity to the Constitution that I rise in 
strong opposition to Senator PAUL’s

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3899 
August 3, 2022 
amendment. This amendment is unnec-
essary, and it ignores the ultimate su-
premacy of the Constitution over for-
eign treaties. Not only that, but this 
amendment even goes so far as to ig-
nore the substance of the North Atlan-
tic Treaty itself. Article 11 of the trea-
ty explains that ‘‘its provisions [shall 
be] carried out by the Parties in ac-
cordance with their respective con-
stitutional processes’’—affirming the 
ultimate supremacy of the U.S. Con-
stitution in governing the actions of 
the United States. Given these facts, it 
is clear that Senator PAUL’s amend-
ment, which would send the United 
States and the entire NATO commu-
nity down a dangerous and unprece-
dented path, is predicated on faulty 
reasoning. 
What is more, Senator PAUL’s amend-
ment regarding article 5 and the Con-
stitution threatens to weaken the 
NATO Alliance itself. The article 5 pro-
vision outlining the collective defense 
obligations of NATO members con-
stitutes one of the central principles of 
the North Atlantic Treaty. The core 
premise of article 5 is very simple: An 
attack against one NATO country 
should be treated as an attack against 
all NATO countries. The strength of 
the NATO alliance depends upon the 
shared understanding of and respect for 
this special obligation by each and 
every 
member 
state. 
But 
Senator 
PAUL’s amendment suggests that each 
member state would be able to offer 
their own, differing interpretation of 
article 5, opening the door to confu-
sion, ambiguity, and potential disorder 
among NATO members. Since the start 
of the NATO alliance, the Senate has 
voted eight times to admit a total of 18 
new members, and on no such prior oc-
casion was an understanding or res-
ervation like this added. To do so now 
would only raise doubts about the na-
ture of our article 5 commitment to 
Sweden and Finland. 
For these reasons, I strongly urge the 
Senate 
to 
reject 
Senator 
PAUL’s 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I just 
spoke an hour ago on the floor, and I 
am a very strong proponent of Sweden 
and Finland joining NATO. I am also a 
very strong supporter of NATO, and I 
want the alliance to endure for decades 
to come. But alliances can’t endure if 
shared commitments and burdens are 
not met. 
This is particularly true for demo-
cratic alliances, where there must be a 
sense among the free citizens of such 
countries that all are pulling their 
weight for the collective defense and 
shared goals they all agree to. 
So the amendment I just called up an 
hour ago, No. 5192, is meant to make 
this clear. It simply states that the 
U.S. Senate expects all NATO members 
to spend a minimum of 2 percent of 
GDP on defense spending as agreed at 
the NATO summit in Wales in 2014. 
This will make NATO stronger, as will 
the accession of Finland and Sweden as 
new members. 
And I ask for a voice vote on this 
amendment. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 5192 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is on 
agreeing to the Sullivan amendment. 
The amendment (No. 5192) was agreed

VOTE ON RESOLUTION OF RATIFICATION 
(NO. 117–3) 
The question occurs on the adoption 
of resolution of ratification, as amend-
ed. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
since its creation over 70 years ago, no 
alliance in human history has done 
more to advance the cause of freedom 
and democracy than NATO. 
Today, at a moment when democracy 
in Europe is under attack, as bellig-
erent autocrats, like Putin, clamor for 
European dominance, the U.S. Senate 
is voting in overwhelming bipartisan 
fashion to approve Finland’s and Swe-
den’s accession to the NATO alliance. 
This is important substantively and as 
a signal to Russia that they cannot in-
timidate America or Europe. 
(Applause.) 
Thank you, Roger. 
Putin has tried to use his war in 
Ukraine to divide the West. Instead, to-
day’s vote shows our alliance is strong-
er than ever. 
I applaud the leaders of Sweden and 
Finland, who made a bold choice to de-
part from their long-held position with 
respect to NATO. I am confident they 
will be excellent partners in this alli-
ance. 
I thank Leader MCCONNELL. Back in 
May, we met with the Finnish Presi-
dent and the Swedish Prime Minister 
and promised to approve their acces-
sion as quickly as possible. Today, we 
are keeping that promise. 
I also want to thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for springing 
into action on this matter, especially 
Senator MENENDEZ, the chair of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
who did such a good job with his rank-
ing member, Senator RISCH, as well as 
Senators SHAHEEN
and TILLIS, who 
have been our leaders in reaching out 
to NATO, for their leadership roles. 
Senators MENENDEZ and RISCH ensured 
their committee acted quickly. 
On a broader note, in the past few 
months, we have seen an amazing 
string of bipartisan achievements in 
this 
Chamber—achievements 
rarely 
seen in such fast succession. We passed 
the first gun safety bill in 30 years, ap-
proved the largest investment in U.S. 
science and technology in generations, 
gave veterans the largest expansion of 
benefits in decades, and today, we are 
strengthening the NATO alliance. All 
of this, every bit of this, was done on a 
bipartisan basis. I have always said 
this Senate Democratic majority would 
be willing to work with the other side 
whenever 
possible, 
and 
these 
past 
months have been some of those mo-
ments. 
Finally, to the Swedish and Finnish 
diplomats who have worked for months 
to reach this moment, rest assured, 
you have many friends in this Cham-
ber. We promise to get this done, and 
we will always, always stand by your 
side as allies defending each other. 
I thank my colleagues for their work. 
Madam President, I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There is a sufficient second.

Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present 
concurring therein). 
SECTION 1. SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUB-
JECT TO DECLARATIONS AND CON-
DITIONS. 
The Senate advises and consents to the 
ratification of the Protocols to the North At-
lantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the 
Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Swe-
den, which were signed on July 5, 2022, by the 
United States of America and other parties 
to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 (Treaty 
Doc. 117–3), subject to the declarations of 
section 2 and the condition of section 3. 
SEC. 2. DECLARATIONS. 
The advice and consent of the Senate 
under section 1 is subject to the following 
declarations: 
(1) Reaffirmation That United States Mem-
bership in NATO Remains a Vital National 
Security Interest of the United States.—The 
Senate declares that— 
(A) for more than 70 years the North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization (NATO) has served 
as the preeminent organization to defend the 
countries in the North Atlantic area against 
all external threats; 
(B) through common action, the estab-
lished democracies of North America and Eu-
rope that were joined in NATO persevered 
and prevailed in the task of ensuring the sur-
vival of democratic government in Europe 
and North America throughout the Cold 
War; 
(C) NATO enhances the security of the 
United States by embedding European states 
in a process of cooperative security planning 
and by ensuring an ongoing and direct lead-
ership role for the United States in European 
security affairs; 
(D) the responsibility and financial burden 
of defending the democracies of Europe and 
North America can be more equitably shared 
through an alliance in which specific obliga-
tions and force goals are met by its mem-
bers; 
(E) the security and prosperity of the 
United States is enhanced by NATO’s collec-
tive defense against aggression that may 
threaten the security of NATO members; and 
(F) United States membership in NATO re-
mains a vital national security interest of 
the United States. 
(2) Strategic Rationale for NATO Enlarge-
ment.—The Senate declares that— 
(A) the United States and its NATO allies 
face continued threats to their stability and 
territorial integrity; 
(B) an attack against Finland or Sweden, 
or the destabilization of either arising from 
external subversion, would threaten the sta-
bility of Europe and jeopardize United States 
national security interests; 
(C) Finland and Sweden, having established 
democratic governments and having dem-
onstrated a willingness to meet the require-
ments of membership, including those nec-
essary to contribute to the defense of all 
NATO members, are in a position to further 
the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty 
and to contribute to the security of the 
North Atlantic area; and 
(D) extending NATO membership to Fin-
land and Sweden will strengthen NATO, en-
hance stability in Europe, and advance the 
interests of the United States and its NATO 
allies. 
(3) Support for NATO’s Open Door Pol-
icy.—The policy of the United States is to 
support NATO’s Open Door Policy that al-
lows any European country to express its de-
sire to join NATO and demonstrate its abil-
ity to meet the obligations of NATO mem-
bership. 
(4) Future Consideration of Candidates for 
Membership in NATO.— 
(A) Senate Finding.—The Senate finds that 
the United States will not support the acces-
sion to the North Atlantic Treaty of, or the 
invitation to begin accession talks with, any 
European state ( other than Finland and 
Sweden), unless— 
(i) the President consults with the Senate 
consistent with Article II, section 2, clause 2 
of the Constitution of the United States (re-
lating to the advice and consent of the Sen-
ate to the making of treaties); and 
(ii) the prospective NATO member can ful-
fill all of the obligations and responsibilities 
of membership, and the inclusion of such 
state in NATO would serve the overall polit-
ical and strategic interests of NATO and the 
United States. 
(B) Requirement for Consensus and Ratifi-
cation.—The Senate declares that no action 
or agreement other than a consensus deci-
sion by the full membership of NATO, ap-
proved by the national procedures of each 
NATO member, including, in the case of the 
United States, the requirements of Article 
II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of 
the United States (relating to the advice and 
consent of the Senate to the making of trea-
ties), will constitute a commitment to col-
lective defense and consultations pursuant 
to Articles 4 and 5 of the North Atlantic 
Treaty. 
(5) Influence of Non-NATO Members on 
NATO Decisions.—The Senate declares that 
any country that is not a member of NATO 
shall have no impact on decisions related to 
NATO enlargement. 
(6) Support for 2014 Wales Summit Defense 
Spending Benchmark.—The Senate declares 
that all NATO members should spend a min-
imum of 2 percent of their Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) on defense and 20 percent of 
their defense budgets on major equipment, 
including research and development, by 2024. 
as outlined in the 2014 Wales Summit Dec-
laration. 
SEC. 3. CONDITION. 
The advice and consent of the Senate 
under section 1 is subject to the following 
conditions 
(1) Presidential Certification.—Prior to the 
deposit of the instrument of ratification, the 
President shall certify to the Senate as fol-
lows: 
(A) The inclusion of Finland and Sweden in 
NATO will not have the effect of increasing 
the overall percentage share of the United 
States in the common budgets of NATO. 
(B) The inclusion of Finland and Sweden in 
NATO does not detract from the ability of 
the United States to meet or to fund its mili-
tary requirements outside the North Atlan-
tic area. 
SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. 
In this resolution: 
(1) NATO Members.—The term ‘‘NATO

Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3901 
August 3, 2022 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about the nomination 
of Robert Gordon. Earlier this year, 
Mr. Gordon had strong bipartisan sup-
port in the Finance Committee when 
his nomination came to a vote. Mr. 
Gordon is President Biden’s nominee to 
serve as the Department of Health and 
Human Services Assistant Secretary 
for Financial Resources, and he has a 
long history of dedication to public 
service. 
More recently, he served as director 
of the Department of Health and 
Human Services for the State of Michi-
gan. He played a central role in the 
State’s pandemic response and man-
aged an agency of 14,000 employees and 
a multibillion-dollar budget. 
Before that, he held senior roles in 
the U.S. Department of Education and 
the Office of Management and Budget, 
where he championed evidence-based 
policymaking to use taxpayer dollars 
wisely. 
Earlier in his career, Mr. Gordon 
served as a senior official at the New 
York City Department of Education. 
He was a senior aide on Capitol Hill, a 
law clerk for Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, and a White House aide. 
In his time at the White House, he 
supported 
the 
development 
of 
the 
AmeriCorps program. 
In his long career in public service, 
he has worked to ensure that govern-
ment programs work for those they 
serve and that they do so through re-
sponsible use of taxpayer dollars. Such 
experience is essential to the work of 
the Assistant Secretary for Financial 
Resources at the Department of Health 
and Human Services. 
HHS has responsibility for critical 
programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and 
the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram, just to name a few. The Assist-
ant Secretary for Financial Resources 
must ensure that these programs and 
many others under the umbrella of the 
Department remain strong for future 
generations. 
I ask unanimous consent that, as if 
in executive session, the Senate con-
sider the following nomination: Cal-
endar No. 762, Robert Michael Gordon, 
to be Assistant Secretary of Health and 
Human Services; that the Senate vote 
on the nomination, without inter-
vening action or debate; that if con-
firmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table and that the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, since last 
year, I have been asking for a commit-
ment from my Democratic colleagues 
that any future reconciliation legisla-
tion in this Congress will not incor-
porate policies that will reduce access 
to care in nonexpansion States, such as 
Tennessee. 
Specifically, my concern is that the 
reconciliation 
legislation 
that 
the 
House of Representatives passed last 
fall, which is the very vehicle for the 
reconciliation bill currently being dis-
cussed in the Senate, included provi-
sions that cut DSH and uncompensated 
care pool payments for nonexpansion 
States. This would result in less 
healthcare for vulnerable populations 
in my State, it would accelerate hos-
pital closures, and it would disadvan-
tage rural communities. These are 
places and populations for which we 
are trying to secure more quality 
healthcare, not less. 
Because I still have not received con-
firmation that these provisions will 
not be included in the final text of the 
partisan reconciliation bill, I cannot 
consent to expediting confirmation of 
this nominee and, therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I want to 
respond, at least preliminarily, to my 
friend from Tennessee. I appreciate his 
advocacy for hospitals in his home 
State of Tennessee. So given that he is 
seeking this assurance about these dis-
proportionate share hospital payments, 
my understanding is that the reconcili-
ation bill we are about to consider this 
week does not contain any provisions 
that are directly relevant and any pro-
vision that would impact these dis-
proportionate share hospitals or un-
compensated care pool funding. 
So given that and given that he is 
seeking this specific assurance about 
the pending reconciliation bill—and I 
think it is evident or will become evi-
dent that the bill does not contain 
these DSH provisions or uncompen-
sated care payment cuts—I would ask 
him just this question, if he would en-
tertain this question: If the Senate 
does pass a reconciliation bill, which I 
hope will be by the end of this week, 
and that bill is then subsequently en-
acted into law, will he lift his objection 
and allow this and other relevant HHS 
nominations to be confirmed by unani-
mous consent? 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I 
would like to respond to my friend 
from Pennsylvania. 
That is a very reasonable request. We 
are getting ready to go through a proc-
ess of which I have not yet seen the 
text—an amendment process that is 
hard to anticipate—and dread to think 
that there would be another wrap-
around, that that could happen as well. 
But assuming that we get to an end 
point and this language that I have dis-
cussed is not in the bill—the same lan-
guage that the House included is not in 
this bill—I would be more than happy 
to lift my objection. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
REMEMBERING JACKIE WALORSKI 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I come to 
the floor this evening, first, wanting to 
take a moment to join Senator BRAUN 
in remembering a good friend to each 
of us, our colleague Congresswoman 
JACKIE
WALORSKI. 
She 
tragically 
passed away in a horrible car accident 
earlier today. 
I, for one, am truly devastated. I 
know that JACKIE loved the State of In-
diana. She loved the Hoosiers through-
out the State. She had an incredible 
sense of humor, incredibly smart, and 
was so talented in many ways. And she 
will be missed. 
I join countless Hoosiers, and I know 
that Senator BRAUN is, in praying for 
her husband Dean, for her entire fam-
ily, and for all those who came to love 
and respect JACKIE. 
I know that so many throughout the 
State are mourning her passing this 
evening, and so many will have impor-
tant things to say about their inter-
action with her and how fond they were 
of her. 
It also should be said that two other 
Hoosiers passed in this horrible acci-
dent, members of her dedicated staff: 
Emma Thomson and Zach Potts. We 
pray for all of them. 
f 
CONDEMNING THE ATTACK THAT 
OCCURRED IN GREENWOOD, INDI-
ANA, ON JULY 17, 2022 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, today, we 
are also on the floor to talk about a 
different tragedy in the State of Indi-
ana. On July 17, there was a terrible 
shooting that occurred at the Green-
wood Park Mall, just miles from my 
home, which resulted in the death of 
three innocent victims. 
Now, it could have easily been one of 
my neighbors or our friend, or, I re-
mind myself, it could have been a 
member of my family who passed away 
there in the food court on that very 
day. 
As this resolution that we are intro-
ducing today states, the U.S. Senate 
condemns this shooting and any vio-
lent action that seeks to bring harm to 
other individuals. We grieve the loss of 
fellow Hoosiers Victor Gomez and 
Pedro and Rosa Pineda, and we pray 
for their families. But we are also 
grateful for the heroes on the scene 
that day, for the first responders, our 
healthcare workers, as well as a young 
man named Eli Dicken. 
Eli was in the food court that 
evening. He was legally carrying his 
own firearm, and when the shooting 
began, he used his weapon to bring 
down the shooter. Were it not for his 
poise during those brief moments, his 
brave and selfless actions, this shoot-
ing would have been far worse. So I ask 
all my fellow Americans to remember 
the victims and the heroes of this trag-
edy, and I urge passage of this resolu-
tion.

ator from Indiana.

August 3, 2022 
REMEMBERING JACKIE WALORSKI 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, earlier 
today, in the normal course of the day, 
I get the tragic news that my good 
friend, one of the first persons I met 
when I was exploring the idea of be-
coming a Senator, JACKIE WALORSKI, 
was tragically killed in a car accident. 
All of us are on the road a lot, and 
you spend those hours—endless, some-
times—and you never imagine that one 
day that could happen. When I heard 
that, it is like the ultimate gut punch. 
Emma Thomson, Zach Potts, died 
along with her—three Hoosiers whom 
we will miss. It is hard to come up with 
the words to say: How did that happen 
and how do you get through it? 
But for most of us, and especially in 
my case with JACKIE, she was one of 
the first great Hoosiers I got to know 
on my own journey. She will be missed 
and our condolences to all of the fami-
lies. 
f 
CONDEMNING THE ATTACK THAT 
OCCURRED IN GREENWOOD, INDI-
ANA, ON JULY 17, 2022 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the memory of the vic-
tims of a senseless act of violence in 
Greenwood, IN, a southern suburb of 
Indianapolis. 
The lives taken that day were enjoy-
ing what should have been a fun July 
day with family and friends. In a mo-
ment’s notice, lives were changed for-
ever when a deranged killer tragically 
took the lives of three people. This is 
happening far too often, and so often it 
seems to have something to do with 
mental illness. This is just another ex-
ample of how it plays out in the real 
world. 
They will never be forgotten. 
This resolution also expresses hope 
for the full recovery of those injured in 
the attack as well. 
I want to mention the victims by 
name. I think that is important: Pedro 
Pineda, Rosa Mirian, Rivera de Pineda, 
and Victor Gomez. You have to remem-
ber the people, their names, because 
this happens far too often. 
Within a mere 15 seconds of the 
shooter opening fire, a citizen by the 
name of Elisjsha Dicken, a 22-year-old 
from Seymour, IN, down in my part of 
the State, rose and stopped the ram-
page. Thank goodness for him. If not 
for his courageous action, the violence 
surely would have been much worse. I 
am proud to acknowledge the man, the 
young man, for defending himself and 
others in a valiant act of bravery in 
the face of unimaginable danger. 
Hoosiers are united in mourning for 
those lost in this senseless attack, and 
we pray for their families to find peace 
in the memory of their loved ones. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of S. Res. 740, 
which is at the desk. I further ask that 
the resolution be agreed to, the pre-
amble be agreed to, and that the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 740) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’)

f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. RES. 741 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent the Senate pro-
ceed to the immediate consideration of 
S. Res. 741, which is at the desk. I fur-
ther ask that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, and that 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have 
read and reread the Senator from Kan-
sas’s resolution. As best I can deter-
mine, it is a declaration of war. For 
that reason, it should be taken very se-
riously. He says, in the earliest stages 
of the preamble, to express the sense of 
the Senate regarding the constitu-
tional right of State Governors to repel 
the dangerous ongoing invasion at the 
U.S. southern border. 
The operative language at the end of 
his resolution on this decoration of war 
relates to a provision in the Constitu-
tion which is rarely quoted. It is sec-
tion 10 of article I. I would like to read 
it into the record. It says: 
No State shall, without the Consent of 
Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep 
Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, 
enter into any Agreement or Compact with 
another State, or with a foreign Power, or 
engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in 
such imminent Danger as will not admit of 
delay. 
I am trying to understand the think-
ing of the Senator from Kansas, but 
here is the best I could come up with. 
He says that what is happening at the 
southern border with our immigration 
issues is, in his words, ‘‘actual invasion 
of the United States.’’ And then goes 
on to say: 
Governors of all 50 States possess the au-
thority and power as Commander in Chief of 
their respective States to repel the invasion 
described in paragraph 2. 
So as best I can determine, the Sen-
ator from Kansas is suggesting that 
each Governor has the power to ini-
tiate military action. It doesn’t say 
who the enemy will be or who the tar-
get will be. But according to this provi-
sion in the Constitution, these Gov-
ernors can enter into compacts with 
other States for this military action or 
with a foreign power. 
I don’t know if the Senator from 
Kansas has thought this through, this 
idea that the State of Kansas would 
team up with the State of Arizona and 
declare war on Nicaragua. Is that what 
he is thinking because Nicaraguans are 
presenting themselves to the border? I 
would suggest that I have never seen a 
declaration of war that calls on the 
States to take such action, and the 
only time—the only precedent in our 
history was a sad one that involved the 
Civil War in the United States. 
I don’t know if the Senator is antici-
pating similar State action—State by 
State or combination of States—at-
tacking a foreign power. For that rea-
son and many others, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise to ask passage by unanimous con-
sent, my resolution to express the 
sense of the Senate that the unprece-
dented crisis at the southern border 
constitutes an invasion of the United 
States of America and that it is the 
constitutional right of State Governors 
to repel the dangerous ongoing inva-
sion across the southern border. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this resolution because the Federal 
Government has failed—intentionally 
or unintentionally—to uphold its obli-
gations to protect the States from in-
vasion under article 4, section 4 of the 
U.S. Constitution. 
During 
his 
campaign 
to 
become 
President, Joe Biden made it clear to 
the entire world that if he became 
President, America would be open—not 
open for business but that our southern 
border would be open, wide open, for 
anyone and everyone to violate our Na-
tion’s immigration laws and to take 
advantage of America’s generosity. 
Yes, it would be wide open for drug 
smugglers, convicted murderers, do-
mestic abusers, and sex offenders, open 
for terror suspects. 
In 2019, Joe Biden called for ‘‘all 
those people seeking asylum’’ to imme-
diately surge to the border. He pledged 
free healthcare for illegal immigrants 
and pledged support for sanctuary cit-
ies. One of his first actions as Presi-
dent was ending proposed legislation to 
Congress that would provide a path to 
citizenship for 10 to 12 million illegal 
aliens residing in the United States. 
On his first day in office, he halted 
construction of President Trump’s bor-
der wall and halted the ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ program. 
This open border—opened by Joe 
Biden—has resulted in an unprece-
dented, unrelenting massive wave of il-
legal aliens entering our country. 
Last year, Border Patrol made more 
than 1.7 million arrests of illegal immi-
grants 
along 
the 
southern 
border, 
which is the highest level ever re-
corded, and is on pace to arrest more 
than 2 million illegal immigrants along 
our border during this fiscal year. 
And now that Joe Biden is prepared 
to end the title 42 policy that enabled

us to expel many of those crossing the 
border back into Mexico, the vast ma-
jority of those violating our country’s 
immigration laws will be released into 
the interior of our Nation where Demo-
crats will insist they remain for the 
rest of their lives. 
Last year, the number of drug over-
dose deaths in the United States 
topped 
100,000—fentanyl 
being 
the 
cause of two-thirds of them. In fact, 
fentanyl is now the No. 1 cause of 
death of Americans, ages 18 to 45. 
Last year, Border Patrol seized at 
the southern border 11,000 pounds of 
fentanyl, 5,400 pounds of heroin, 191,000 
pounds of meth, 97,000 pounds of co-
caine, and 10,000 pounds of ketamine— 
many, many, many multiples of the 
amounts needed to kill every man, 
woman, and child in the United States. 
Now, if you speak to Border Patrol 
agents trying to deal with the crisis, 
they will tell you the Biden adminis-
tration has completely forbidden them 
to enforce immigration law. They have 
been made ushers and nursemaids for 
illegal immigration. 
This invasion is wreaking havoc on 
communities all across our country, 
and it simply cannot go on any longer. 
It is long past time for States to pro-
tect their interests because Joe Biden 
has made it clear the Federal Govern-
ment will not. 
President Biden’s dereliction of duty 
and failure to take care that the laws 
be faithfully executed at our southern 
border has directly put the citizens of 
all 50 States in danger and has resulted 
in loss of life. 
Let me be crystal clear. The violent 
activity and smuggling of drugs, hu-
mans, guns, and other illicit goods car-
ried 
out 
by 
drug 
cartels 
and 
transnational criminal organizations 
meet the definitions of ‘‘actually in-
vaded’’ under clause 3 of section 10 of 
article I of the U.S. Constitution; and 
‘‘invasion’’ under section 4 of article IV 
of the U.S. Constitution; and Gov-
ernors of all 50 States possess the au-
thority and power as commander in 
chief of their respective States to repel 
the invasion described in paragraph 2. 
I encourage the passage of this reso-
lution to stand in solidarity with the 
Governors of these United States who 
must take matters in their own hands 
to protect their citizens against this 
invasion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
f 
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with 
me today is Mr. Wesley Davis, one of 
my able aides in my office. I would like 
to talk for a few minutes about crime. 
It is up. It is way up. The largest city 
in my State is New Orleans, and New 
Orleans is on track to becoming the 
murder capital of the world. In my 
State and in my city of New Orleans, 
we have seen a 136-percent rise in 
homicides, a 101-percent rise in shoot-
ings, 
and 
a 
194-percent 
rise 
in 
carjackings. And this is not just a Lou-
isiana and a New Orleans problem. 
Baton Rouge, LA—Baton Rouge, of 
course, is my capital city—and Shreve-
port are not much better. And violent 
crime is also on the rise in major cities 
from the west coast to the east coast. 
We hear a lot about Chicago, of 
course, and New York City, but from 
May of 2021 to May of 2022, crime was 
up 23 percent in Seattle. It was up 21 
percent in Washington, DC. 
And I would respectfully suggest this 
is no coincidence. For almost 2 years 
now—2 years, long time—some people 
in positions of authority in our country 
have been calling to defund the police, 
to dismantle the police. And they have 
been disrespecting the police. 
Many of our public officials—not all 
of them, but some happen to be mayors 
in major cities—they believe that cops 
are a bigger problem than criminals. 
They do. 
They believe that when a cop shoots 
a criminal, it is automatically the 
cop’s fault. When a criminal shoots a 
cop, it is the gun’s fault. And we also 
have prosecutors, district attorneys— 
not all of them but too many of them 
who live by the motto: Hear no evil, 
see no evil, and prosecute no evil. And 
we can now see the result of that atti-
tude. 
It is an anti-law enforcement atti-
tude. Now, look, I know cops aren’t 
perfect. I get it. Some of our police of-
ficers get out of line intentionally. And 
when they do, they should be punished. 
But do you know when a radical 
jihadist who happens to be a Muslim 
blows up a school full of school chil-
dren, we are told don’t blame all Mus-
lims because of the acts of a few. 
And, gosh, I agree with that, and I 
know the Presiding Officer does too. 
How come the same rule doesn’t apply 
to cops? I don’t understand. This anti- 
law 
enforcement 
sentiment, 
under-
standably, has resulted in lower morale 
among cops. Duh. It has led to massive 
resignations. It has led to massive 
early retirements. 
It has in my State, and it has in most 
other States. It turns out that when 
you spend years vilifying police offi-
cers and making it harder for them to 
do their job, some of them no longer 
want to stay. That is not surprising. 
In the city of New Orleans, we have 
fewer than 1,000 police officers. We 
need 2,000. This year alone, more than 
100 police officers have already quit. 
That is around the same number of po-
lice officers who resigned, retired, or 
were fired in 2020. And these statistics 
are nationwide; it is not just New Orle-
ans. 
The Dallas Police Department is 
down 550 law enforcement officials. In 
Portland, OR, the department is look-
ing to fill more than 100 positions for 
cops. 
A headline from last week said: 
As officers leave in droves, New Orleans 
PD’s response times soar to 2.5 hours. 
That is not the way our country 
should work. 
Now, you can talk about defunding 
the police all day, and I don’t want to 
paint with too broad a brush here—not 
everyone does. But too many people do. 
But the reality is that defunding the 
police results in delayed responses to 
9-1-1 phone calls. It demoralizes cops. It 
causes a lack of good recruits, and it 
causes our communities to be less safe. 
I don’t know why this is—if I make it 
to Heaven, I am going to ask—but 
there is some people in our society— 
not just in America but throughout the 
world—these people are not sick; they 
are not mixed up; they are not con-
fused. It is not that their mother or 
their father did not love them enough. 
They are just antisocial. 
I don’t know why, but they are. And 
they hurt other people. And they steal 
other people’s stuff. And they can’t live 
in society. And to protect us from 
them, we have to have law enforce-
ment. It is just that simple. 
So here is, in my opinion, what we 
do, because it is hard not to notice that 
what we are doing right now is not 
working. I don’t mean to be cruel, but 
a lot of Americans look around at the 
people 
who 
are 
disrespecting 
and 
defunding the police—or trying to—and 
the attitude of those Americans is, 
look, don’t bother to send in the 
clowns; they are already here. 
The American people want and de-
serve better. What should we do? No. 1, 
we have to empower our cops. And 
when they make a mistake inten-
tionally, when they intentionally vio-
late their oath, they should be pun-
ished. But that is a small minority of 
our law enforcement officials. So we 
need to empower our cops. 
As I said, we have too many people in 
positions of authority who really think 
cops are a bigger problem than crimi-
nals. We have to pay our cops. We have 
got to hire more of them. We have got 
to stand behind them. 
When they make a split-second deci-
sion, they shouldn’t be thinking, Oh, 
my God, I might lose my family and 
my home and my job. When they act in 
good faith and they have to make a 
split-second decision, we have to stand 
behind them. And we have to tell our 
police officers to enforce all laws—not 
just the big ones, the little ones. And 
we have to get rid of the ‘‘hear no evil, 
see no evil, prosecute no evil’’ prosecu-
tors. 
It is also important that we ask our-
selves another question: Why is it that 
so many young offenders—especially in 
our inner cities—why is it that so 
many of these young criminals are 
more likely to grow up and go to prison 
than own a home or get married? Why 
is that? 
Because that is true, and that is an 
embarrassment. And I will give you 
one reason: Because their schools suck. 
They do. Too many of our schools are 
failure factories. We need to fix them. 
We need to find out which of our teach-
ers can teach and pay them. We need to 
find out which of our teachers can’t 
teach and either teach them how or 
tell them to find a new line of work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3904 
August 3, 2022 
I can’t recite to you the first six 
Presidents of the United States in 
proper order, but I will never forget, 
ever, my first, second, third, fourth, 
fifth, and sixth grade teachers. Teach-
ers matter. We need to have no-excuses 
schools. I believe every child can learn; 
I do. It is tougher for some than others, 
but I believe that every child can learn. 
And I think we need a new rule: I 
don’t care how old you are—I don’t 
care—you are not going to get out of 
the third grade until you can read and 
write. No exceptions. None. 
And also, I think we have to give our 
public schools some competition. We 
need more charter schools. We need 
more school choice. We need to em-
power our parents. Give them vouch-
ers. Give those public schools some 
competition. It will make all of our 
schools better. 
I want to end this way: Look, it is 
hard to be a cop. It is hard to be a cop. 
And cops are like all the rest of us; 
they are not perfect. They make mis-
takes. 
But only a small, small, small per-
centage 
intentionally 
violate 
their 
oath. We need to empower those that 
abide by their oath because they are 
the ones keeping our communities safe. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT 
AGREEMENT—Executive Calendar 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask

consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate proceed to executive ses-
sion to consider Calendar No. 1100, 
Roopali H. Desai, of Arizona, to be U.S. 
Circuit judge for the Ninth Circuit; 
that there be 10 minutes for debate, 
equally divided in the usual form, on 
the nomination; that upon the use or 
yielding back of time, the Senate vote 
on the nomination without intervening 
action or debate; that if confirmed, the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table; that any 
statements related to the nomination 
be printed in the RECORD; that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action and the Senate re-
sume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO RECIPIENTS OF THE 
CONGRESSIONAL AWARD 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I wish to congratulate this 
year’s winners of the Congressional 
Award. Established by Congress in 1979, 
the award recognizes the achievements 
of young Americans between the ages 
of 14 and 23 years old and celebrates 
their accomplishment in four program 
areas: voluntary public service, per-
sonal development, physical fitness, 
and expedition/exploration. 
The award challenges participants to 
set goals in an area that interests 
them, encourages them to pursue new 
interests, and helps them grow along 
the way. If they are successful in their 
pursuit, they earn bronze, silver, and 
gold certificates and medals. Through 
this long-running program, generations 
of young Americans have learned new 
skills, earned greater confidence, and 
positioned themselves for future suc-
cess. 
On Friday, August 5, Gold Medal re-
cipients will gather for a virtual cere-
mony to receive their Congressional 
Award. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I 
would like to congratulate all of the 
winners for their accomplishments and 
for the example they set for their 
peers. Among this impressive group, 
my State of Kentucky is home to nine 
gold medalists. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that a list of this year’s recipients 
of the Congressional Award Gold Medal 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

NATO 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent to have the following ar-
ticle printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
A UNIFIED SENATE, AND A UNIFIED NATO— 
OPINION 
(By Senator Angus King (I–Maine)) 
Six months ago, President Vladimir Putin 
ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine 
with no provocation, breaking a European 
peace that has lasted since the Allies turned 
back Adolph Hitler’s attacks during World 
War II. Today, this new dictator with delu-
sions of grandeur is threatening global 
peace, and history shows that we cannot 
stand by and hope for the best. The free 
world must defend our shared values; that 
begins with presenting a united front. 
This week, the U.S. Senate took a historic 
step to meet that responsibility by voting to 
approve Sweden and Finland’s applications 
to join the NATO Alliance. The vote was 
overwhelming, and bipartisan—in total, the 
applications were approved by a vote of 95 to 
1. The result shows that Putin’s egregious 
and brutal power-grab has unified the U.S. 
Senate—just as it has unified the broader 
global community. 
Since the war in Ukraine began, thousands 
of innocent Ukrainians have been killed, 
millions have been forced from their homes, 
and billions around the globe have been 
forced to shoulder increased costs on fuel 
and food. The damage wrought by Putin’s 
forces is nothing short of horrific—but if 
Putin expected the rest of the world to roll 
over and accept his invasion, he miscalcu-
lated. Badly. 
If you want evidence of this miscalcula-
tion, you need look no further than the state 
of 
North 
Atlantic 
Treaty 
Organization, 
which has been reinvigorated in light of 
Putin’s aggression and is only getting 
stronger. A wide range of countries have 
come together to provide military and hu-
manitarian aid to help Ukrainians stand 
strong. Beyond supporting Ukraine during 
the current crisis. NATO members have also 
reaffirmed their commitment to one another 
in the event of further Russian aggression. 
The crisis also prompted Sweden and Fin-
land—two proud and strong nations that 
have long remained neutral—to seek acces-
sion into NATO. The addition of the two Nor-
dic nations will make NATO stronger and 
more unified in the face of Putin’s misguided 
and murderous ambitions to rebuild the So-
viet Union. 
I saw the potential benefits of these new 
additions earlier this year, when I traveled 
to Finland as part of a bipartisan congres-
sional delegation (called a CODEL) shortly 
after they formally requested NATO mem-
bership. My colleagues and I met with the 
nation’s president and his top defense offi-
cials to discuss the nation’s position in the 
current state of play. Finland has a long his-
tory of dealing with Russia—a necessity, 
given the two nations’ shared 800–mile bor-
der. They also have a very capable military, 
as does Sweden. 
Combined, the two nations will strengthen 
the defensive capabilities of NATO—and I 
must stress the importance of NATO’s defen-
sive nature. NATO’s charter does not require 
member nations to enter into proactive mili-
tary activities; rather, military action is 
only invoked in collective defense. This is 
why Russian accusations of new threats 
posed by a larger NATO are flat-out false; 
the only way these new additions could cre-
ate conflict between Russia and NATO is if 
Russia intends to launch yet another violent 
invasion of a peaceful neighbor. 
On the heels of the Senate’s overwhelming 
vote, I am hopeful that Finland and Swe-
den’s applications will move forward swiftly. 
The lone NATO member that has expressed 
hesitancy to admit the new members, Tur-
key, has also demonstrated a willingness to 
waive its concerns if certain conditions are 
met. Our bipartisan CODEL also traveled to 
Turkey shortly after we left Finland, seek-
ing to talk through their concerns and ad-
dress their needs through tangible actions. 
My Senate colleagues and I left our meetings 
optimistic that the differences between Tur-
key and the Nordic nations can be resolved— 
and it now appears this is the case. 
This week’s vote and our trip to Eastern 
Europe has made one thing abundantly clear: 
the free world stands united against Vladi-
mir Putin’s would-be empire building, and is 
ready to respond against his illegal and im-
moral military attacks. NATO, the United 
States, and the U.S. Senate will not allow 
him to destroy freedom-loving nations; we 
will stand with our allies, as we have in the 
past, united against deposition. 
(At the request of Mr. SULLIVAN, the 
following statement was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD.) 
f 
NATO 
∑ Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, due to 
unforeseen circumstances I was unable 
to be present today for votes on amend-
ment No. 5192 to the Resolution of Ad-
vice and Consent to Ratification for 
the Accession of the Republic of Fin-
land and the Kingdom of Sweden to 
NATO. I offer this statement for the 
RECORD in support of amendment No. 
5192 and in support of the underlying 
resolution. 
Amendment No. 5192, offered by my 
good friend from Alaska, Mr. DAN SUL-
LIVAN, would amend existing language 
in the Resolution of Advice and Con-
sent to say, ‘‘the Senate declares that 
all NATO members should spend a min-
imum of 2 percent of their gross domes-
tic product on defense and 20 percent of 
their defense budgets on major equip-
ment, including research and develop-
ment, by 2024, as outlined in the 2014 
Wales Summit Declaration.’’ This lan-
guage is stronger and clearer than the 
current resolution language, and it 
would deliver a clear message to the 
President that Congress expects him to 
engage our allies on alliance spending 
obligations. 
Finally, the Resolution of Advice and 
Consent to Ratification for the Acces-
sion of the Republic of Finland and the 
Kingdom of Sweden to NATO would 
add two excellent allies who will be 
significant contributors to the NATO 
Alliance. Finland and Sweden both pos-
sess fully funded, modern, self-suffi-
cient, highly capable militaries. Their 
addition to the NATO alliance will help 
to share the burden of NATO defense

The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin, Bethesda, MD. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this sale will not re-
quire the assignment of any U.S. Govern-
ment personnel but will require one (1) con-
tractor representative, Full-Time Equivalent 
(FTE) position to Greece to continue follow- 
on support and sustainment to Greece’s S– 
70B/S–70B6 helicopters.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
United Arab Emirates—Terminal High Alti-
tude Area Defense (THAAD) System Mis-
siles and THAAD Fire Control and Commu-
nication Stations 
The Government of the United Arab Emir-
ates (UAE) has requested to buy ninety-six 
(96) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense 
(THAAD) missile rounds; two (2) THAAD 
Launch Control Stations (LCS); and two (2) 
THAAD Tactical Operations Stations (TOS). 
Also included are repair and return, system 
integration and checkout, and spare and re-
pair parts; support and testing equipment; 
publications and technical documentation; 
construction activities; encryption devices; 
secure communication equipment; other re-
quired COMSEC equipment; and other re-
lated elements of logistical and program sup-
port. The total estimated program cost is 
$2.245 billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
an important regional partner. The UAE is a 
vital U.S. partner for political stability and 
economic progress in the Middle East. 
The proposed sale will improve the UAE’s 
ability to meet current and future ballistic 
missile threats in the region, and reduce de-
pendence on U.S. forces. The UAE will have 
no difficulty absorbing this equipment into 
its armed forces, as it currently employs the 
THAAD system. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Space Systems Corporation, Sunny-
vale, CA. It is anticipated the purchaser will 
request offsets. Any offset agreement will be 
defined in negotiations between the pur-
chaser and the contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the UAE. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 22–32 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Terminal High Altitude Area De-
fense (THAAD) system is the first weapons 
system with both endo- and exo-atmospheric 
capability specifically developed to defend 
against ballistic missiles. The higher alti-
tude and theater-wide protection offered by 
THAAD provides more protection of larger 
areas than lower-tier systems alone. THAAD 
is designed to defend against short, medium 
and intermediate range ballistic missiles. 
The THAAD system consists of four major 
components: Fire Control/Communications 
System (comprised of the Tactical Oper-
ations Station, Launch Control Station, and 
System Support Group), Radar, Launchers 
and Interceptors. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems, which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
UAE can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of the 
United Arab Emirates.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Javelin Weapon System is a me-
dium-range, 
man 
portable, 
shoulder- 
launched, fire and forget, anti-tank system 
for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. 
It may also be mounted on a variety of plat-
forms 
including 
vehicles, 
aircraft 
and 
watercraft. The system weighs 43.5 pounds 
and has a maximum range in excess of 4,500 
meters. The system is highly lethal against 
tanks and other systems with conventional 
and reactive armors. The system possesses a 
secondary capability against bunkers. 
2. Javelin’s key technical feature is the use 
of fire-and-forget technology which allows 
the gunner to fire and immediately relocate 
or take cover. Additional special features are 
the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an 
advanced tandem warhead and imaging in-
frared seeker, target lock-on before launch, 
and soft launch from enclosures or covered 
fighting positions. The Javelin missile also 
has a minimum smoke motor thus decreas-
ing its detection on the battlefield. 
3. The Javelin Weapon System is com-
prised of two major tactical components, 
which are a reusable Light Weight Command 
Launch Unit (LWCLU) and a round con-
tained in a disposable launch tube assembly. 
The LWCLU incorporates an integrated day- 
night sight that provides a target engage-
ment capability in adverse weather and 
countermeasure environments. The LWCLU 
may also be used in a stand-alone mode for 
battlefield surveillance and target detection. 
The LWCLU’s thermal sight is a 3rd genera-
tion Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sen-
sor. To facilitate initial loading and subse-
quent updating of software, all on-board mis-
sile software is uploaded via the LWCLU 
after mating and prior to launch. 
4. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is UNCLASSI-
FIED. 
5. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
6. A determination has been made that the 
United Kingdom can provide substantially 
the same degree of protection for the sen-
sitive technology being released as the U.S. 
Government. This sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
7. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of the 
United Kingdom.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Saudi Arabia—PATRlOT MIM–104E Guidance 
Enhanced Missile-Tactical Ballistic Mis-
siles (GEM-T) 
The Kingdom ofSaudi Arabia has requested 
to buy three hundred (300) PATRIOT MIM– 
104E Guidance Enhanced Missile-Tactical 
Ballistic missiles (GEM-T). Also included are 
tools and test equipment; range and test pro-
grams; support equipment to include associ-
ated publications and technical documenta-
tion; training equipment; spare and repair 
parts; New Equipment Training; Transpor-
tation; Quality Assurance Team support; 
U.S. Government and contractor technical 
assistance; engineering, and logistics support 
services; Systems Integration and Checkout 
(SICO); field office support; International 
Engineering Services Program Field Surveil-
lance Program; and other related elements of 
logistics and program support. The total es-
timated cost is $3.05 billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a partner country that is a force for 
political stability and economic progress in 
the Gulf region. 
The proposed sale will improve the King-
dom of Saudi Arabia’s capability to meet 
current and future threats by replenishing 
its dwindling stock of PATRIOT GEM-T mis-
siles. These missiles are used to defend the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s borders against 
persistent Houthi cross-border unmanned 
aerial system and ballistic missile attacks 
on civilian sites and critical infrastructure 
in Saudi Arabia. These attacks threaten the 
well-being of Saudi, International, and U.S. 
citizens (approximately 70,000) residing in 
the Kingdom. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
will have no difficulty absorbing these mis-
siles into its armed forces.

normally requests offsets. Any offset agree-
ment will be defined in negotiations between 
the purchaser and the contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to note that, during this coming 
recess, we will mark the somber occa-
sion of the 1-year anniversary of the 
fall of Kabul and the Taliban takeover 
of Afghanistan. I want to draw the at-
tention of the Senate and the Amer-
ican people to one of our most urgent 
priorities in Afghanistan: providing im-
mediate assistance for Afghan citizens 
that risked their lives to further U.S. 
interests and whose lives now stand in 
jeopardy should we not act soon. 
Nine days—in the short span of 9 
days after seizing control of the first 
province to fall on August 6, 2021— 
Nimruz—a whirlwind of chaos ensued. 
The world watched as, one by one, all 
of the country’s provinces fell to 
Taliban forces until finally reaching 
the capital Kabul on August 15. With 
little resistance from the Afghan forces 
we had trained and equipped over two 
decades, the Taliban simply entered 
and took control. In terrified despera-
tion, many Afghans gathered what 
they could carry with them and fled. 
People left their whole lives behind— 
their houses, their jobs, their friends 
and family—risking their lives to flee 
the country in the wake of the Taliban 
takeover. Shocking images of Afghans 
clinging to U.S. evacuation flights as 
they took off could not have shown a 
clearer picture of the despair of so 
many Afghans. 
Amid this panic, the Biden adminis-
tration 
acted 
swiftly 
to 
evacuate 
American personnel and most Amer-
ican citizens. 
We joined our international allies to 
call for a new Afghan Government that 
is united, inclusive, and representative, 
including with full participation of 
women. We joined international voices 
to reaffirm our commitment to ensur-
ing rights of women and girls in Af-
ghanistan. And along with our NATO 
allies, we committed to evacuate at- 
risk Afghans. 
And make no mistake, we as Ameri-
cans remain committed to all these 
priorities. We stand united with our al-
lies to further these goals and ensure a 
stable and secure Afghanistan. Central 
to the Taliban’s beliefs is the Pashtun 
code of ethics, ‘‘Pashtunwaly,’’ in 
which ‘‘nang’’—which means honor— 
stands as the central tenet. It is with 
‘‘nang’’ in mind that we call on the 
Taliban to honor their commitment to 
provide an accountable and inclusive 
government. We urge them to honor 
their original and oft-repeated promise 
to uphold human rights and support 
education for women and girls—com-
mitments that recent reporting sug-
gests they are not fulfilling. 
We call on them to honor their com-
mitment to provide a safe and secure 
Afghanistan for all Afghans. We join 
our allies in the international commu-
nity in these calls for action. 
Yet in the aftermath of the fall of Af-
ghanistan, there remains one priority 
for the U.S. alone to undertake: ensur-
ing the well-being of Afghan citizens 
who put their lives on the line to serve 
our country. These are the Afghans 
who worked at our Embassy and other 
diplomatic facilities, served as our 
translators, helped us engage with the 
Afghan Government, and provided us 
information and assistance. They are 
the Afghans that served and studied in 
U.S.-affiliated centers and universities. 
They are the Afghans who worked tire-
lessly to promote our principles as 
journalists working for U.S.-affiliated 
outlets, like the Afghan services of 
RFE/RL, Radio Azadi, and Ghandara. 
Without their assistance, U.S. lives 
would have been lost. Without their 
support, we would have been unable to 
talk about our U.S. values and prior-
ities to the Afghan people. 
Without them, we would not have 
been able to work with the Govern-
ment of Afghanistan to promote our 
shared goal of regional stability and se-
curity. To these individuals and their 
families, we owe a great debt for their 
assistance. The 77,000 Afghans cur-
rently in the pipeline for special immi-
grant visas, the 44,000 that await proc-
essing for their P1/P2 visas, and yet an-
other almost 5,000 that seek humani-
tarian parole, these individuals are all 
counting on us. So I call on the State 
Department to make renewed efforts to 
expedite these cases. 
I would like to recognize that, to 
date, our government has made enor-
mous strides in this herculean effort; 
tens of thousands of these individuals 
were evacuated from Afghanistan fol-
lowing the collapse of the government. 
Yet tens of thousands more remain 
stranded in limbo, both in Afghanistan 
as well as in third countries—among 
others, in Pakistan, Qatar, UAE, Geor-
gia, Albania, and the Kyrgyz Republic. 
They wait patiently, many of them 
running through their personal sav-
ings, many unable to work. 
We continue to support these individ-
uals, oftentimes maintaining a delicate 
dialogue with the host countries about 
the long-term plans for these individ-
uals. 
I would like to share with you the 
story of one such individual whose life 
hangs in the balance. It is with her per-
mission that I share this story, and I 
will call her ‘‘Arezo’’ to safeguard her 
anonymity. Arezo is a bright young Af-
ghan woman of Hazara heritage who 
studied at a U.S. university and later 
worked for an international human 
rights NGO. By all accounts, up until 
the collapse of Afghanistan, she was 
one of the many Afghans working to 
build a bright future for Afghanistan. 
When Kabul fell, like so many others, 
Arezo shred all the documents tying 
her in any way to the United States. 
She knew that if the Taliban discov-
ered this connection, both her life and 
her family’s lives could be at risk. 
While attempting to flee, Arezo and 
her brother were discovered by the 
Taliban and taken in for questioning 
about their reasons for wanting to 
leave the country. Arezo’s brother was 
savagely beaten. Arezo was subjected 
to a humiliating virginity test. They 
were both taken into custody for sev-
eral weeks, during which they endured 
brutal and inhumane treatment, often 
ridiculed by the Taliban guards for 
their Shi’a faith as ‘‘untrue Muslims.’’ 
While incarcerated, Arezo witnessed 
the brutal rape of a 12-year-old girl at 
the hands of the Taliban. The crime of 
this child? She had been imprisoned for 
riding in local transport without a 
male family member escort. Miracu-
lously, after external pressure, Arezo 
was released, but not without the 
threat hanging over her head that the 
Taliban would keep tabs on her. Arezo 
now waits for the United States to 
process her visa. Hers is one of the over 
44,000 cases that remain backlogged, 
while her life hangs in the balance. 
I tell you this: It is in our direct, im-
mediate interest to dedicate and re-
allocate resources to resolve pending 
cases like those of Arezo.

August 3, 2022 
Until we resolve their cases, we con-
tinue to expend enormous U.S. re-
sources to support them in third coun-
tries, with no clear end in sight. We 
continue to ask much of our bilateral 
partners that have generously agreed 
to take in these evacuees. Our Embas-
sies and government Agencies will con-
tinue to struggle with the overload 
caused by the burden of managing 
these extra cases. But most impor-
tantly, we owe it to these individuals 
who put their own lives on the line for 
our county to process their cases 
quickly. 
It is no accident that I chose the 
name ‘‘Arezo’’ as a stand-in for the 
young Afghan woman who, like so 
many others, awaits our action. Arezo 
is a Hazara name that means ‘‘hope’’ or 
‘‘faith.’’ And like so many others, she 
has taken it on faith that the U.S. Gov-
ernment will make good on its promise 
to take care of the Afghans like her 
that have served—and continue to 
serve—U.S. interests and who still be-
lieve in the American dream and still 
believe that America will fulfill her 
promises. 
I encourage that at all levels of gov-
ernment, we work to identify resources 
to reallocate towards this goal. We 
have the resources, but we must redi-
rect these resources and make it a top 
priority. I call on our State Depart-
ment and USCIS colleagues to elevate 
the task of processing cases to a high 
priority status. I propose that we con-
vene in committee to discuss addi-
tional ways that Congress can support 
the successful resolution of their cases 
and permanent resettlement. On the 
eve of the 1-year anniversary of an ig-
nominious American withdrawal from 
Afghanistan, after a two-decade effort, 
I urge that across all lines of govern-
ment, we recognize this priority and 
work promptly to resolve the cases of 
the many Afghans who have put their 
lives on the line for our country.

PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER 
SUPPORT ACT 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, 
this week, the U.S. Senate acted, 
unanimously, to honor our Nation’s 
dedicated law enforcement officers, 
firefighters, and emergency responders 
by passing the Public Safety Officer 
Support Act, known as PSOSA. 
I was proud to author the bipartisan 
Public Safety Officer Support Act and 
want to thank Senator CORNYN and 
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman 
DURBIN for their steadfast leadership 
and hard work in helping pass this 
vital legislation that seeks to mod-
ernize the Public Safety Officers’ Bene-
fits Program by recognizing that, when 
a public safety officer dies by suicide, 
there should be a rebuttable presump-
tion that the loss should be designated 
as a line of duty death. 
I look forward to President Joe Biden 
signing the bipartisan Public Safety 
Officer Support Act into law and re-
main confident in the U.S. Department 
of Justice’s readiness to effectively im-
plement this important new law. My 
confidence is rooted in the Depart-
ment’s 
productive 
engagement 
and 
helpful technical assistance that was 
provided throughout the development 
of the final version of PSOSA. 
Of course, the Public Safety Officer 
Support Act would never have passed 
without the steadfast support and dedi-
cation of a wide range of organizations, 
such as the Fraternal Order of Police, 
National Association of Police Organi-
zations, Federal Law Enforcement Offi-
cers Association, Sergeants Benevolent 
Association NYPD, National Associa-
tion of Attorneys General, National 
District Attorneys Association, Major 
County Sheriffs Association, National 
Sheriffs Association, National Border 
Patrol Council, United States Capitol 
Police 
Labor 
Committee, 
BLUE 
H.E.L.P., The Wounded Blue, American 
Psychological Association, American 
Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 
International Union of Police Associa-
tions, 
International 
Association 
of 
Chiefs of Police, National Prison Coun-
cil, National Narcotics Officers Asso-
ciations’ Coalition, American Federa-
tion of State, County and Municipal 
Employees, National Association for 
Children’s Behavioral Health, Inter-
national 
Society 
for 
Psychiatric 
Nurses, Meadows Mental Health Policy 
Institute, Depression and Bipolar Sup-
port Alliance, SMART Recovery, Ken-
nedy 
Forum, 
Inseparable, 
National 
Council for Mental Wellbeing, National 
Association for Rural Mental Health, 
American Mental Health Counselors 
Association, National Association of 
Social Workers, Postpartum Support 
International, National Association of 
State and Mental Health Program Di-
rectors, American Association for Psy-
choanalysis in Clinical Social Work, 
and the Association for Behavioral and 
Cognitive Therapies. 
This impressive array of support for 
PSOSA reflects the importance and ur-
gency of fixing a specific flaw in the 
Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Pro-
gram. Under current law, despite pub-
lic safety officers facing a heightened 
risk 
for 
developing 
posttraumatic 
stress and having trauma-induced sui-
cides, family member survivors of po-
lice officers and firefighters that com-
mit suicide are excluded from the pro-
gram. This means that surviving fami-
lies are often left without any Federal 
support, State and local survivor annu-
ities, or continued access to their loved 
ones’ health insurance. 
Comparatively, 
the 
U.S. 
Armed 
Forces recognizes that servicemember 
suicides are line-of-duty deaths. More 
than 90 percent of the 1,107 Active-Duty 
Army suicides between 2005 and 2012 
were determined to be in the line of 
duty. Just like our servicemembers, 
our first responders should be recog-
nized and supported for the mental dis-
tress they endure while protecting our 
communities and responding to emer-
gencies. That includes supporting their 
surviving families after they are gone. 
Once signed into law and imple-
mented, the bipartisan Public Safety 
Officer Support Act will finally provide 
grieving families the benefits their 
loved ones earned while serving their 
communities as public safety officers 
and, equally important, help us elimi-
nate the harmful stigma and infliction 
of emotional distress and pain on sur-
vivors that stems from misguided and 
outdated policies that refuse to des-
ignate public safety officer suicides as 
line of duty deaths. 
Now, I want to be clear. Ensuring 
that public safety officer suicides are 
considered line of duty deaths for pur-
poses of participating in the Public 
Safety Officers’ Benefits Program is 
about honoring a fallen police officer’s 
or firefighter’s life of service. It is 
about honoring these Americans and 
caring for their families, just as we do 
when a public safety officer dies from 
heart disease or COVID in the line of 
duty. 
Simply put, our bipartisan law will 
ensure surviving families of fallen pub-
lic safety officers receive the support 
their loved ones earned through a life 
of service. 
We are seeking to ensure eligibility 
for the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits 
Program no longer allows the manner 
of death to negate a career devoted to 
public service and serving one’s com-
munity. And that is why it is also im-
portant to emphasize that a presump-
tion of a line of duty death is not an 
absolute. 
Just as committing suicide should 
not deny a public safety officer and 
their family a line-of-duty death des-
ignation, in and of itself, taking one’s 
life would not entitle a disgraced pub-
lic safety officer who violated their 
oath of office to receive a Public Safe-
ty Officers’ Benefits Program benefit. 
It is our intent that the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice will review and take 
into account the potential contributing 
factors to the officer or firefighters’ 
death or injury and consult the agency 
investigating the cause and manner of 
death and the agency of the police offi-
cer or firefighter, just as the Depart-
ment’s Bureau of Justice Assistance 
Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Pro-
gram Office is empowered to do in all 
other claims submitted to the program. 
Moving forward, I hope enactment of 
the Public Safety Officer Support Act 
inspires the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial Fund and other 
State and local law enforcement me-
morials to update their respective line- 
of-duty death criteria to match the 
Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Pro-
gram. After all, our Nation’s support of 
first responder families is particularly 
critical following the tragic loss of a 
police officer, a firefighter, or an emer-
gency responder, and these grieving 
families deserve to be included among 
the families of the fallen. 
In closing, I want to take a moment 
to recognize the incredible courage, re-
silience, and strength of the late Offi-
cer Jeffrey Smith’s widow, Erin Smith,

Smith. Their collective determination 
and commitment to fixing an unjust 
system to prevent future families of 
the fallen from having to experience 
the emotional pain and financial harm 
resulting from the denial of a line-of- 
duty death designation, played a piv-
otal role in the development and pas-
sage of the Public Safety Officer Sup-

I commend Erin, Richard and Wendy

with comfort and confidence that his 
tragic loss was not in vain.

TRIBUTE TO NIELS HANSEN 
Mr. 
BARRASSO. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I rise in recognition of the lead-
ership and accomplishments of Wyo-
ming Rancher and Public Lands Coun-
cil President Niels Hansen. 
This is Niels’ final year as a member 
of the Public Lands Council executive 
council. He will be honored on Friday, 
August 26 at their 2022 Annual Meeting 
Banquet hosted in Cody, WY. Niels has 
served on the PLC’s executive council 
since 2016. He also served as Wyoming’s 
delegate to the PLC’s sage grouse task 
force. Niels is a consistent and strong 
voice for ranching and the western way 
of life. His work has had a tremendous 
impact on public land policy, both na-
tionally and in Wyoming. 
Niels is the third generation operator 
of PH Livestock. Located in the high 
desert near Rawlins, WY, the ranch’s 
need for proper management and re-
source 
conservation 
is 
paramount. 
Niels’ great uncles, Peter and Jim Han-
sen, came to Rawlins from Denmark in 
the early 1900s to start their own 
ranches. His father joined them in 1927 
and later took over for Jim. Niels and 
his sister Anna, were the first born in 
the United States and continue the leg-
acy of their family and their land. 
As Niels describes, ‘‘We do not try to 
maximize anything, but we try to opti-
mize everything. We work to operate in 
balance with nature by making any ad-
justments needed to keep the ranch 
producing a consistent, predictable 
manner 
while 
protecting 
the 
land 
where we live.’’ 
Niels built a reputation as someone 
who brings stakeholders together to 
find the best possible solutions. PH 
Livestock operates on the Bureau of 
Land Management checkerboard that 
is spread throughout southern Wyo-
ming. He brought the agriculture in-
dustry, energy industry, and Federal 
and State agencies to the same table to 
address the challenges of maintaining 
and improving the land. 
Niels has worked with the University 
of Wyoming and the BLM for over 20 
years to monitor and collect data on 
his land. This data builds the founda-
tion to develop the best practices for 
the rangeland. Niels constantly shares 
his dedication and knowledge to advo-
cate for sound policy. He served as 
chairman of the Wyoming State Graz-
ing Board and president of the Wyo-
ming Stock Growers Association. Niels 
has testified in front of congressional 
committees many times. He testified 
in 2018, during my time as chairman of 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee. Niels promotes coopera-
tion between Federal agencies and 
landowners. He gives a firsthand per-
spective of the effects of regulations on 
the people it impacts the most. 
Niels’ ability to build relationships 
and success in conservation was recog-
nized in 2011 when he was inducted into 
the 
Wyoming 
Agriculture 
Hall 
of 
Fame. PH Livestock received the BLM 
Rangeland Management Stewardship 
award in 2000. In 2004, the ranch was a 
cowinner of the Wyoming Stock Grow-
ers Association Stewardship Award. 
Niels understands the importance of 
family and tradition to a successful 
ranch. He has two children with his 
wife, Barbara. Their daughter Steph-
anie is married to Reese Irvine, and 
they have two sons, Eli and Caleb. 
Their son John and his wife Tawsha 
Lubbers have two sons, Niels Kai and 
Jep. Niels’ sister, Anna Helms, is his 
business partner and helps manage the 
ranch with her two children, Travis 
and Heidi, along with Travis’ son Dane. 
Niels instilled in his family a love of 
the land to ensure future generations 
will enjoy their ranch. 
It is a great honor to recognize this 
exceptional member of our Wyoming 
community. As I mentioned upon his 
induction to the Wyoming Agriculture 
Hall of Fame, ‘‘Wyoming lands—both 
public and private—are better because 
of his service.’’ My wife Bobbi joins me 
in extending our gratitude and well 
wishes to Niels Hansen on his future 
endeavors.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO GREG TABOR 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize U.S. Marshal Greg 
Tabor whose dedication to law enforce-
ment and community service will be 
deeply missed following his retirement. 
Marshal Tabor’s devotion to public 
safety is grounded in his years of serv-
ing and protecting the people of Arkan-
sas. 
Greg Tabor earned his police officer 
certificate from the Arkansas Law En-
forcement Training Academy. He began 
his career as a firefighter and emer-
gency medical technician in Eureka 
Springs. He worked for a local com-
pany before launching his law enforce-
ment 
career 
with 
the 
Washington 
County Sheriff’s Office. He joined the 
Fayetteville Police Department in 1985 
and honorably served for 34 years, with 
13 years as chief of police. In addition, 
he served as chairman of the board for 
the Fourth Judicial District Drug Task 
Force. 
He continued his public service as 
chief of police at the Northwest Arkan-
sas National Airport. In 2020, I was 
honored to support his confirmation to 
serve as U.S. Marshal for the Western 
District of Arkansas. 
Given his long and distinguished ca-
reer in law enforcement, it is no sur-
prise he excelled in the position. 
As U.S. Marshal, Tabor helped direct 
law enforcement responses to local, re-
gional, and Federal investigations and 
preserve public safety. His career pre-
pared and served him well during his 
tenure leading the service’s Western 
District of Arkansas branch and car-
rying on its storied legacy in The Nat-
ural State. 
His dedication serves as an inspira-
tion for all Arkansans. I applaud his 
leadership, perseverance and commit-
ment to serving our State and uphold-
ing law and order. His guidance and ex-
perience have helped us build a better 
Arkansas. 
We can be proud of Marshal Greg Ta-
bor’s lifelong service. He has embodied 
what it means to serve and protect and 
deserves our thanks for bettering com-
munities in our State. 
He is a true public servant whose im-
pact will be felt for years to come. It 
has been an honor to work with him 
during his service, and I wish him all 
the best in his next endeavor.∑

RECOGNIZING RUDY’S A COOK’S 
PARADISE 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to 
honor Rudy’s A Cook’s Paradise as the 
Idaho Small Business of the Month for 
August 2022. 
Constructed in 1904, the oldest con-
tinually operating retail store in Twin 
Falls first housed Price Hardware. 
Rudy Ashenbrener purchased the store 
after returning from his time as a 
fighter pilot instructor in World War 
II. It remained a hardware store until 
2002, when Rudy’s son Tom and his wife 
Megan took over the business, renamed 
it Rudy’s A Cook’s Paradise, and 
turned it into a world of gourmet cook-
ing. 
Today, Rudy’s offers one of the larg-
est selections of kitchen gadgets in the 
northwest, including cooking utensils 
and cookware, wine, beer, and more. 
The store features a test kitchen where 
they offer classes on food techniques, 
artisanal bread baking, and how to 
throw a dinner party. The 118-year-old 
building also boasts a vast collection of 
wine and beer in its lava rock cellar. 
Rudy’s beloved staff goes beyond serv-
ing aspiring chefs, providing southern 
Idaho with opportunities to experience 
new products, tastes, and techniques. 
From its home on Main Avenue, Rudy’s 
has found its way into the hearts of 
many Idahoans. 
Congratulations to Tom and Megan 
Ashenbrener and all of the employees

TRIBUTE TO REBECA SOSA 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to recognize the work of a 
wonderful 
Floridian, 
Miami-Dade 
County Commissioner Rebeca Sosa. 
Born in Camaguey, Cuba, Commis-
sioner Sosa and her family escaped the 
island following the Communist Revo-
lution and fled to Puerto Rico, where 
she grew up. She received her bach-
elor’s degree in secondary education 
from the University of Puerto Rico, be-
fore earning another degree in elemen-
tary education from Saint Thomas 
University in Miami Gardens. She has 
been an educator for more than 30 
years and is currently a teacher-train-
er 
for 
Miami-Dade 
County 
Public 
Schools. 
Since 2001, Commissioner Sosa has 
also served on the Miami-Dade County 
Commission as the District Six com-
missioner. In 2012, she was elected by 
her colleagues as chairwoman of the 
county commission, where she served a 
2-year term. Before her time on the 
county commission, she spent 7 years 
serving as the mayor of the city of 
West Miami. 
Commissioner Sosa has spent her ca-
reer working to improve the lives of 
Floridians living in the city of Miami, 
Coral Gables, West Miami, Hialeah, 
and Miami Springs. Having fled Cuba, 
she understands the value of freedom 
and has sought to create a community 
in Miami-Dade County that promotes 
opportunity and prosperity. 
In her decades of public service, Com-
missioner Sosa has done immense good 
for the residents of Miami-Dade Coun-
ty. 
As mayor of West Miami, she helped 
the city recover from a 52 percent 
budget deficit and secured more than $5 
million in grants for capital improve-
ment projects and improvements to the 
city’s drainage and park systems. 
As a county commissioner, she sup-
ported transportation projects as she 
championed Port Miami, signed a sis-
ter port agreement with the Puerto 
Rico Ports Authority, and worked to 
increase the number of international 
flights out of Miami International Air-
port. Commissioner Sosa has also used 
her position to help improve care for 
Florida’s seniors by creating the Elder 
Affairs Advisory Board and sponsoring 
legislation to form what would become 
the Elder Abuse Task Force. Addition-
ally, her work to protect Florida’s en-
vironment has been recognized by 
many, and her successful efforts to se-
cure funding for community projects 
and parks has improved the lives of 
Floridians 
throughout 
Miami-Dade 
County. 
What is more, as a member of the 
Cuban diaspora, Commissioner Sosa 
has used her position to fight for de-
mocracy and human rights in Cuba and 
to stand against the abuses of the ille-
gitimate communist Cuban regime. 
Last year, she led the county commis-
sion to unanimously declare July 11, 
2021, to be ‘‘Patria y Vida/SOS Cuba 
Day’’ in Miami-Dade County. 
And all along the way, she has sought 
to improve the economic conditions of 
Miami, and to support small businesses 
owners and create jobs for Florida fam-
ilies. 
I want to recognize Commissioner 
Sosa for all of her work to support Flo-
ridians living in Miami-Dade County 
and thank her for friendship and dec-
ades of public service. Miami-Dade 
County and the State of Florida are 
better off because of her service to the 
community and to the State, and Flo-
ridians wish her the best of luck as she 
leaves the county commission.∑

SENATE RESOLUTION 741—TO EX-
PRESS THE SENSE OF THE SEN-
ATE REGARDING THE CONSTITU-
TIONAL RIGHT OF STATE GOV-
ERNORS TO REPEL THE DAN-
GEROUS 
ONGOING 
INVASION 
ACROSS 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. MARSHALL submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 741 
Whereas, during a 2019 Democratic presi-
dential primary debate, President Biden 
called for ‘‘all those people seeking asylum’’ 
to ‘‘immediately surge to the border’’; 
Whereas, during a 2019 Democratic presi-
dential primary debate, President Biden 
raised his hand when candidates were asked 
if their health plans will provide coverage 
for illegal immigrants; 
Whereas, during a 2020 Democratic presi-
dential primary debate, President Biden 
pledged support for ‘‘sanctuary cities’’ when 
he stated that illegal immigrants arrested by 
local police should not be turned over to 
Federal immigration authorities; 
Whereas, on January 20, 2021, one of Presi-
dent Biden’s first actions as President was 
sending proposed legislation, the U.S. Citi-
zenship Act, to Congress, which would pro-
vide a path to citizenship for an estimated 
10,000,000 to 12,000,000 illegal immigrants who 
are currently residing in the United States; 
Whereas, on January 20, 2021, President 
Biden also issued a ‘‘Proclamation on the 
Termination Of Emergency With Respect To 
The Southern Border Of The United States 
And Redirection Of Funds Diverted To Bor-
der Wall Construction’’, which halted con-
struction of physical barriers along the 
international border between the United 
States and Mexico, and he later terminated 
existing border wall construction contracts 
and failed to obligate more than $1,000,000,000 
that Congress had lawfully appropriated for 
border wall construction; 
Whereas, on January 20, 2021, President 
Biden also halted enrollments in the Migrant 
Protection Protocols policy, which is also 
known as the ‘‘remain in Mexico’’ program; 
Whereas on February 6, 2021, U.S. Sec-
retary of State Antony Blinken suspended 
and terminated the Asylum Cooperative 
Agreements with the Governments of El Sal-
vador, of Guatemala, and of Honduras; 
Whereas in March 2022, the Department of 
Homeland Security began implementing the 
interim final rule titled ‘‘Procedures for 
Credible Fear Screening and Consideration 
of Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and 
CAT Protection Claims by Asylum Offi-
cers’’✖ which authorizes U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services to consider the asylum 
applications of individuals subject to expe-
dited removal and violates the law enacted 
by Congress that requires asylum seekers to 
offer evidence to persuade a judge in an im-
migration court; 
Whereas, during fiscal year 2021, U.S. Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement exe-
cuted 59,000 deportations, which represents 
the lowest number of deportations since fis-
cal year 2008, and fewer than 1⁄3 as many de-
portations as the number of people who were 
deported during fiscal year 2020, and is sig-
nificantly lower than the 226,000 to 410,000 re-
movals that occurred every fiscal year since 
2008; 
Whereas, during fiscal year 2021, U.S. Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement— 
(1) arrested 48 percent fewer convicted 
criminals than had been arrested during the 
prior fiscal year; 
(2) deported 63 percent fewer criminals 
than had been deported in the prior fiscal 
year; and 
(3) issued 56 percent fewer ‘‘detainer re-
quests’’ to local authorities than had been 
issued in the prior fiscal year; 
Whereas, during fiscal year 2021, U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection made more than 
1,700,000 arrests of illegal immigrants along 
the international border between the United 
States and Mexico, which is the highest level 
ever recorded, and is on pace to arrest more 
than 2,000,000 illegal immigrants along such 
border during fiscal year 2022; 
Whereas, on April 1, 2022, President Biden 
announced the termination of a public 
health policy used to expel potentially in-
fected illegal immigrants during the COVID– 
19 pandemic (commonly known as ‘‘title 42’’); 
Whereas, on September 30, 2021, Depart-
ment 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
Secretary 
Alejandro Mayorkas issued a memorandum 
titled ‘‘Guidelines for the Enforcement of 
Civil Immigration Law’’, which stated that 
an alien’s illegal status in the United States 
should not be the sole basis of an enforce-
ment action and prioritized for apprehension 
and removal aliens who are a threat to na-
tional security, public safety, or border secu-
rity; 
Whereas, on October 12, 2021, Secretary 
Mayorkas 
issued 
a 
memorandum 
titled 
‘‘Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to 
Protect the American Labor Market, the 
Conditions of the American Worksite, and 
the Dignity of the Individual’’, which in-
cluded Department-wide guidance to cease 
mass worksite operations, among other in-
structions; 
Whereas, on October 27, 2021, Secretary 
Mayorkas 
issued 
a 
memorandum 
titled 
‘‘Guidelines for Enforcement Actions in or 
Near Protected Areas’’, which listed numer-
ous protected areas where the enforcement 
of Federal immigration law should not 
occur; 
Whereas, in May 2022, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection arrested 239,416 illegal im-
migrants along the international border be-
tween the United States and Mexico, which 
is the highest number of arrests ever re-
corded in a single month; 
Whereas President Biden’s fiscal year 2023 
budget request aims to shift the Department 
of Homeland Security’s border management 
away from enforcement and toward ‘‘effec-
tively managing irregular migration along 
the Southwest border’’; 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion has apprehended illegal immigrants 
from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nica-
ragua, Cuba, Haiti, Brazil, other Central and 
Latin American nations, Turkey, India, Rus-
sia, and other nations outside of the Western 
Hemisphere; 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Patrol 
has apprehended 50 people since October 1, 
2021 along the international border between 
the United States and Mexico who are listed 
on the Federal Bureau of Investigations’ ter-
rorist screening database; 
Whereas, U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion arrested more than 7,000 illegal aliens in 
fiscal year 2022 who have been convicted of 1 
or more crimes in the United States or 
abroad, including— 
(1) 219 convicted sexual criminals; 
(2) 45 who were convicted of homicide or 
manslaughter; 
(3) 195 who were convicted of illegal weap-
ons possession, transport, or trafficking; 
(4) 561 who were convicted of burglary, rob-
bery, larceny, theft, or fraud; and 
(5) 711 who were convicted of assault, bat-
tery, or domestic violence; 
Whereas, during fiscal year 2021, U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection seized— 
(1) 11,203 pounds of fentanyl; 
(2) 5,400 pounds of heroin; 
(3) 191, 824 pounds of methamphetamine; 
(4) 97,638 pounds of cocaine; and 
(5) 10,848 pounds of ketamine; 
Whereas, provisional data from the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics of the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
estimates that there were 107,622 drug over-
dose deaths in the United States during 2021, 
an increase of nearly 15 percent from the es-
timated 93,655 deaths in 2020, with overdose 
deaths involving opioids increasing from an 
estimated 70,029 in 2020 to an estimated 80,816 
in 2021, and overdose deaths from synthetic 
opioids 
(primarily 
fentanyl), 
psychostimulants 
(such 
as 
methamphet-
amine), and cocaine also increasing during 
2021. 
Whereas clause 1 of section 10 of article I of 
the United States Constitution states, in 
part, ‘‘No State shall, without the Consent of 
Congress . . . engage in War, unless actually 
invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will 
not admit of delay.’’; 
Whereas section 4 of article IV of the 
United States Constitution states, in part, 
‘‘The United States shall guarantee to every 
State in this Union a Republican Form of 
Government, and shall protect each of them 
against Invasion’’; 
Whereas, in the context of known security 
concerns due to a lack of proper vetting 
processes and systems, and in conjunction 
with how the mass unlawful movement of 
people across the border of the United States 
directly empowers and enriches cartels and 
transnational gangs, the totality of such ac-
tivity constitutes an invasion; 
Whereas, on October 26, 2021, Arizona State 
Representative Jake Hoffman sent a letter 
to Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich 
requesting a formal legal opinion deter-
mining whether President Biden has violated 
his obligations to protect Arizona from inva-
sion under section 4 of article IV of the 
United States Constitution; and 
Whereas, on February 7, 2022, Arizona At-
torney General Mark Brnovich issued a for-
mal legal opinion, which states, in part— 
(1) ‘‘The on-the-ground violence and law-
lessness at Arizona’s border caused by car-
tels and gangs is extensive, well-docu-
mented, and persistent. It can satisfy the 
definition of ‘actually invaded’ and ‘inva-
sion’ under the U.S. Constitution.’’; and 
(2) ‘‘Arizona retains the independent au-
thority under the State Self-Defense Clause 
to defend itself when actually invaded.’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate finds that— 
(1) President Biden’s dereliction of duty 
and failure to take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed at our southern border 
has directly put the citizens of all 50 States 
in danger and has resulted in loss of life; 
(2) the violent activity and smuggling of 
drugs, humans, guns, and other illicit goods 
carried out by drug cartels and transnational 
criminal organizations, and the crossing of 
the international border between legal ports 
of entry by significant numbers of individ-
uals contrary to the laws of the United 
States, meet the definitions of— 
(A) ‘‘actually invaded’’ under clause 3 of 
section 10 of article I of the United States 
Constitution; and 
(B) ‘‘invasion’’ under section 4 of article IV 
of the United States Constitution; and 
(3) Governors of all 50 States possess the 
authority and power as Commander-in-Chief 
of their respective States to repel the inva-
sion described in paragraph (2).

maintain the health of the ocean, including 
through kelp farming, which absorbs carbon 
dioxide from seawater; 
Whereas throughout history, Presidents of

lean protein that is low in saturated fat and

porated into foods such as pho, gnocchi, 
doughnuts, cocktails, ice cream, and butter;

world; 
Whereas lobsters have inspired artists in 
the United States and throughout the world 
for hundreds of years;

skincare, fertilizers, and biodegradable golf 
balls;

States enjoy lobster rolls to celebrate sum-
mer, from beaches to backyards and from 
fine-dining restaurants to lobster shacks; 
and

well, bringing families and friends together: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 25, 2022, as ‘‘Na-
tional Lobster Day’’; and

‘‘(1) APPLICATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph 
(B), in the case of a biological product that 
would (but for this subsection) be an ex-
tended-monopoly drug (as defined in section 
1194(c)(4)) included as a selected drug on the 
list published under subsection (a) with re-
spect to an initial price applicability year, 
the rules described in paragraph (2) shall 
apply if the Secretary determines that there 
is a high likelihood (as described in para-
graph (3)) that a biosimilar biological prod-
uct (for which such biological product will be 
the reference product) will be licensed and 
marketed under section 351(k) of the Public 
Health Service Act before the date that is 2 
years after the selected drug publication 
date with respect to such initial price appli-
cability year. 
‘‘(B) REQUEST REQUIRED.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall not 
provide for a delay under— 
‘‘(I) paragraph (2)(A) unless a request is 
made for such a delay by a manufacturer of 
a biosimilar biological product prior to the 
selected drug publication date for the list 
published under subsection (a) with respect 
to the initial price applicability year for 
which the biological product would have 
been included as a selected drug on such list 
but for subparagraph (2)(A); or 
‘‘(II) paragraph (2)(B)(iii) unless a request 
is made for such a delay by such a manufac-
turer prior to the selected drug publication 
date for the list published under subsection 
(a) with respect to the initial price applica-
bility year that is 1 year after the initial 
price applicability year for which the bio-
logical product described in subsection (a) 
would have been included as a selected drug 
on such list but for paragraph (2)(A). 
‘‘(ii) INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS.— 
‘‘(I) IN
GENERAL.—A request made under 
clause (i) shall be submitted to the Secretary 
by such manufacturer at a time and in a

the term ‘partnership’ means a syndicate, 
group, pool, joint venture, or other organiza-
tion through or by means of which any busi-
ness, financial operation, or venture is car-
ried on by the manufacturer of the biological 
product and the manufacturer of the bio-
similar biological product. 
‘‘(2) RULES DESCRIBED.—The rules described 
in this paragraph are the following: 
‘‘(A) DELAYED SELECTION AND NEGOTIATION 
FOR 1 YEAR.—If a determination of high like-
lihood is made under paragraph (3), the Sec-
retary shall delay the inclusion of the bio-
logical product as a selected drug on the list 
published under subsection (a) until such list 
is published with respect to the initial price 
applicability year that is 1 year after the ini-
tial price applicability year for which the bi-
ological product would have been included as 
a selected drug on such list. 
‘‘(B) IF NOT LICENSED AND MARKETED DURING 
THE INITIAL DELAY.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—If, during the time period 
between the selected drug publication date 
on which the biological product would have 
been included on the list as a selected drug 
pursuant to subsection (a) but for subpara-
graph (A) and the selected drug publication 
date with respect to the initial price applica-
bility year that is 1 year after the initial

product for which the manufacturer sub-
mitted 
the 
request 
under 
paragraph 
(1)(B)(i)(II) (and for which the Secretary pre-
viously made a high likelihood determina-
tion under paragraph (3)) has not been li-
censed and marketed under such section 
351(k), the Secretary shall, at the request of 
such manufacturer— 
‘‘(I) reevaluate whether there is a high 
likelihood (as described in paragraph (3)) 
that such biosimilar biological product will 
be licensed and marketed under such section 
351(k) before the selected drug publication 
date that is 2 years after the selected drug 
publication date for which such biological 
product would have been included as a se-
lected drug on such list published but for 
subparagraph (A); and 
‘‘(II) evaluate whether, on the basis of 
clear and convincing evidence, the manufac-
turer of such biosimilar biological product 
has made a significant amount of progress 
(as determined by the Secretary) towards 
both such licensure and the marketing of 
such biosimilar biological product (based on 
the items described in paragraph (3)(B)) since 
the receipt by the Secretary of the request 
made by such manufacturer under paragraph 
(1)(B)(i)(I). 
‘‘(ii) SELECTION
AND
NEGOTIATION.—If the 
Secretary determines that there is not a 
high likelihood that such biosimilar biologi-
cal product will be licensed and marketed as 
described in clause (i)(I) or there has not 
been a significant amount of progress as de-
scribed in clause (i)(II)— 
‘‘(I) the Secretary shall include the bio-
logical product as a selected drug on the list 
published under subsection (a) with respect 
to the initial price applicability year that is 
1 year after the initial price applicability 
year for which such biological product would

1-YEAR
DELAY.—If the Sec-
retary determines that there is a high likeli-
hood that such biosimilar biological product 
will be licensed and marketed (as described 
in clause (i)(I)) and a significant amount of 
progress has been made by the manufacturer 
of such biosimilar biological product towards 
such licensure and marketing (as described 
in clause (i)(II)), the Secretary shall delay 
the inclusion of the biological product as a 
selected drug on the list published under sub-
section (a) until the selected drug publica-
tion date of such list with respect to the ini-
tial price applicability year that is 2 years 
after the initial price applicability year for 
which such biological product would have 
been included as a selected drug on such list 
but for this subsection. 
‘‘(C) IF NOT LICENSED AND MARKETED DURING 
THE YEAR TWO DELAY.—If, during the time pe-
riod between the selected drug publication 
date of the list for which the biological prod-
uct would have been included as a selected 
drug but for subparagraph (B)(iii) and the se-
lected drug publication date with respect to 
the initial price applicability year that is 2 
years after the initial price applicability 
year for which such biological product would 
have been included as a selected drug on 
such list but for this subsection, the Sec-
retary determines that such biosimilar bio-
logical product has not been licensed and 
marketed— 
‘‘(i) the Secretary shall include such bio-
logical product as a selected drug on such 
list with respect to the initial price applica-
bility year that is 2 years after the initial 
price applicability year for which such bio-
logical product would have been included as 
a selected drug on such list; and 
‘‘(ii) the manufacturer of such biological 
product shall pay a rebate under paragraph 
(4) with respect to the years for which such

graphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) shall be 
applied as if the term ‘payment amount 
benchmark period’ were defined under sub-
section (g)(3) as the first calendar year be-
ginning after the day on which the drug was 
first marketed and subparagraph (B) of para-
graph (3) shall be applied as if the term

dosage form, the Secretary shall establish a 
formula for determining the rebate amount 
under paragraph (1) and the inflation ad-
justed payment amount under paragraph (3)

longer considered to be a selected drug under 
section 1192(c), for each applicable period (as 
defined under subsection (g)(7)) beginning 
after the price applicability period with re-
spect to such drug, subparagraphs (A) and 
(B) of paragraph (4) shall be applied as if the 
term ‘payment amount benchmark period’ 
were defined under subsection (g)(3) as the 
last year beginning during such price appli-
cability period with respect to such selected 
drug and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) 
shall be applied as if the term ‘benchmark 
period CPI–U’ were defined under subsection 
(g)(4) as if the reference to ‘January 2021’ 
under such subsection were a reference to 
‘January of the last year beginning during 
such price applicability period with respect 
to such drug’. 
‘‘(6) RECONCILIATION
IN
CASE
OF
REVISED 
AMP REPORTS.—The Secretary shall provide 
for a method and process under which, in the 
case of a manufacturer of a part D rebatable 
drug that submits revisions to information 
submitted under section 1927 by the manu-
facturer with respect to such drug, the Sec-
retary determines, pursuant to such revi-
sions, adjustments, if any, to the calculation 
of the amount specified in this subsection for 
a dosage form and strength with respect to 
such part D rebatable drug and an applicable 
period and reconciles any overpayments or 
underpayments in amounts paid as rebates

be subject to, in accordance with a process 
established by the Secretary pursuant to 
regulations, a civil money penalty in an 
amount equal to 125 percent of the amount 
specified in subsection (b) for such drug for 
such period. The provisions of section 1128A

amounts of penalties or additional assess-
ments) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money 
penalty under this subsection in the same 
manner as such provisions apply to a penalty 
or proceeding under section 1128A(a).

OR JUDICIAL RE-
VIEW.—There shall be no administrative or

The 
Subcommittee 
on 
Emerging 
Threats and Spending Oversight of the 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs is authorized to 
meet during the session of the Senate 
on Wednesday, August 3, 2022, at 2:30

PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Heidi 
Zisselman, a fellow in my office, be 
granted floor privileges through Au-
gust 4, 2022. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if 
there is no further business to come be-
fore the Senate, I ask that it stand ad-
journed under the previous order, fol-
lowing the remarks of Senator SAND-
ERS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, my 
understanding is that the so-called In-
flation Reduction Act may be coming 
to the floor in the coming days, and 
there are some people who think it is 
still worth supporting. There are oth-
ers who think that it is not. But what-
ever your views on this bill may be, let 
us be clear. As currently written, this 
is an extremely modest piece of legisla-
tion that does virtually nothing to ad-
dress the enormous crises that working 
families all across this country are fac-
ing today. 
This reconciliation bill falls far short 
of what the American people want, 
what they need, and what they are beg-
ging us to do. Given that this is the 
last reconciliation bill that we will be 
considering this year, it is the only op-
portunity that we have to do some-
thing significant for the American peo-
ple that requires only 50 votes and that 
cannot be filibustered. In other words, 
this is the opportunity, because on 
anything significant, we are not going 
to get 60 votes. So this, in my view, is 
a moment that should not be squan-
dered. 
Let us do what we too rarely do here 
in the Congress or in the corporate 
media, and that is to take a hard look 
at the reality of what is going on in our 
country today. Very often, we sit here, 
and we argue about this, we argue 
about that, but we don’t take a look at 
what is going on in America today, es-
pecially among working people and 
low-income people who do not have 
paid lobbyists here trying to get us to 
pass legislation to benefit them. 
People back home are just too busy 
working 50, 60 hours a week, trying to 
make it on Social Security, trying to 
deal with their student debt. They 
don’t have the lobbyists here that the 
drug companies and the insurance com-
panies and the fossil fuel industry has. 
What is going on in America today? 
For a start, in the richest country in 
the history of the world, half of our 
people live paycheck to paycheck, and 
because of inflation, a bad situation 
has been made worse. Millions of peo-
ple today are wondering how they are 
going to pay their rent, how they are 
going to buy the food to feed their 
kids, how they are going to pay off 
their debt. That is what is going on for 
half of the people in our country. I 
know we don’t talk about it. They have 
no representation here, no lobbyists, 
no nothing. But that is the reality. 
Does this reconciliation bill address 
their needs? Does it raise the minimum 
wage to a living wage or do we con-
tinue to allow so many workers to try 
to get by on 10, 12, 13 bucks an hour? 
Does this bill make it easier for 
workers who want to join a union to be 
able to do so or they continue to be at-
tacked by their employers, making it 
hard to form a union? No, this bill does 
nothing to address that reality. 
At a time when, tragically, this 
country has the highest rate of child-
hood poverty of almost any major 
country on Earth, does this bill extend 
the $300-a-month-per-child tax credit 
that was so important to millions of 
families last year? Does it address that 
issue? Does it say that, maybe, there is 
something wrong when millions of chil-
dren in this country are dealing with 
hunger and with other basic human 
needs? No, not a word in this bill ad-
dresses that. 
In my State of Vermont and around 
this country, families are paying on av-
erage about $15,000 a year for childcare, 
if they are lucky enough to find a slot. 
And $15,000 a year is one-third of the 
salary of a family making $45,000. I 
don’t know how people can afford 
childcare. And, meanwhile, childcare 
workers earn horrifically low wages 
and have poor benefits. 
At a time when we have the highest 
rate of childhood poverty of any major 
country on Earth, does this bill address 
the dysfunctionality of our childcare 
system? No, not a word. And, again, 
this is a reconciliation bill, where we 
only need 50 votes to make these 
changes. 
At a time when over 70 million Amer-
icans are uninsured or underinsured, 
when we spend twice as much per cap-
ita on healthcare as the people of al-
most any other major country while 
insurance companies make tens and 
tens of billions of dollars a year in 
profit, when 60 million people a year 
die because they can’t afford to get to 
a doctor when they are sick because 
they are uninsured or underinsured, 
does this bill do anything to help us 
create 
a 
rational, 
cost-effective 
healthcare 
system 
that 
guarantees 
healthcare for all as a human right, 
something that every other major 
country on Earth does? No, the bill 
does nothing to address the extraor-
dinary healthcare crisis that we face. 
At a time when 45 million Americans 
are struggling to pay student debt and 
when hundreds of thousands of bright 
young people every year are unable to 
fulfill their dreams, unable to get a 
higher education because they cannot 
afford the high cost of higher education 
in this country, does this bill do any-
thing to make it easier for young peo-
ple to get a higher education? No, it 
does not. It doesn’t do a thing. It 
doesn’t do a thing on student debt. 
Fifty-five percent of senior citizens 
in our country are trying to survive on 
incomes of $25,000 a year or less. It is 
just something hard for me to under-
stand. It really is. Think about being 
80, 90 years of age, trying to make it on 
$25,000 a year. Maybe your spouse has 
died. I don’t know how you do it, but 
more than half of our people in our 
country who are seniors are trying to 
do that. 
Many of these seniors cannot afford 
to go to a dentist, and in Vermont— 
and, I suspect, in Arizona, as well— 
there 
are 
senior 
citizens 
walking 
around without teeth in their mouth or 
with teeth that are rotting. There are 
seniors all over this country who can-
not communicate with their kids or 
grandchildren because they can’t afford 
a hearing aid. They can’t watch TV be-
cause they can’t afford a decent pair of 
glasses. 
Is there anything in the currently 
written bill to expand Medicare to do 
what some 75 or 80 percent of the 
American people think we should do, 
and that is expand Medicare to cover 
dental care for seniors, hearing aids, 
and eyeglasses? No, the bill doesn’t 
touch that at all. 
When we talk about our seniors and 
disabled Americans, does this legisla-
tion do anything to help the millions 
who would prefer to stay in their 
homes rather than be forced into nurs-
ing homes? It is an issue I hear quite

frequently in Vermont: We cannot find 
help for someone to come to my house 
to help my mother or my disabled fa-
ther. Does this bill address the crisis of 
home healthcare, a very serious crisis? 
No, not a word. 
I think there is no disagreement that 
we have a major housing crisis in 
America. Some 600,000 Americans are 
homeless, and nearly 18 million house-
holds are spending an incredible 50 per-
cent of their limited incomes for hous-
ing. Everybody acknowledges that we 
have a major housing crisis and that 
rents are soaring. Does this bill that 
supposedly represents the needs of the 
American people even deal with hous-
ing? In one word, no, it doesn’t. 
I understand that in our politics 
today, super PACs and billionaires play 
an enormous role in what we do here 
and what we don’t do. Just yesterday, 
we saw the power of billionaire super 
PACs selecting corporate candidates 
who represent their interests and de-
feating candidates who represent work-
ing families. That is the way the polit-
ical system is, and it has been made 
worse since Citizens United. 
But right now, in our country—and I 
know we don’t talk about it very 
much; I hear almost no discussion on 
the floor—we have more income wealth 
inequality than at any time in 100 
years. How do the American people feel 
knowing that three people own more 
wealth than the bottom half of Amer-
ican society? Does that sound like the 
America we believe in, the America we 
think we should be? 
We talk about Russia and Putin and 
the oligarchy over there. It is true. An 
oligarchy robs the country blind. 
We have an oligarchy here as well. 
Three people own more wealth than the 
bottom half of American society. The 
top 1 percent owns more wealth than 
the bottom 92 percent, and 45 percent 
of all new income goes to the top 1 per-
cent. And what we have seen during 
the pandemic is billionaires becoming 
much richer while working people by 
the thousands die because they have to 
go to work to make a living. 
Today, CEOs of large corporations 
make 350 times more than their aver-
age workers. That is what is going on 
in America. I know we don’t want to 
talk about it because we don’t want to 
offend the people who fund our cam-
paigns. It makes them uncomfortable 
to talk about how much inequality we 
have in this country, but that is the re-
ality. 
Not only do we have income and 
wealth inequality, but we have another 
issue we don’t talk about much—or 
maybe a little bit. We have more con-
centration of ownership than at any 
time in the modern history of this 
country. In sector after sector after 
sector, we have a handful of giant mul-
tinational corporations, often engaging 
in price-fixing, that control what is 
produced and how much we pay for it. 
I think many Americans now notice 
that, at a time when we are paying in-
creased costs at the gas pump, in-
creased costs at grocery stores for food, 
surprise, surprise, surprise, these large 
corporations 
are 
making 
record-
breaking profits. Paying five bucks for 
a gallon of gas? Well, the good news is 
that ExxonMobil and these other cor-
porations are making huge profits. 
Unbelievably, three Wall Street firms 
now control assets of over $20 trillion. 
That is the GDP of the United States of 
America being controlled by three Wall 
Street firms. Is that of concern to any-
body? Think it might be something we 
might want to talk about in a rec-
onciliation bill? Nah, can’t do that. 
These are very powerful guys, and we 
are not supposed to offend the wealthy 
and the powerful. 
These three Wall Street firms are the 
major stockholders in 96 percent of 
S&P 500 companies. Check out the 
companies of the products that you 
buy. Find out who owns them. Find out 
who owns the companies that you are 
familiar with. Time and time and time 
again, you will find that the major 
stockholders 
are 
these 
three 
Wall 
Street firms: BlackRock, State Street, 
and Vanguard. 
Does this bill do anything to even 
begin addressing the enormous con-
centration of ownership in our country 
and make our economy more competi-
tive? Not a word. 
So my point is that we are living in 
a moment of unprecedented crises. This 
bill does virtually nothing to address 
any of them, and this is the oppor-
tunity because, theoretically, it could 
be done with 50 votes here in the Sen-
ate. If all of the Democrats voted for 
it—if any Republicans voted for it, it 
would be great—plus the Vice Presi-
dent, we could do it. We could do it, 
but as currently written, it is not being 
done. 
Now, let me say a few words about 
what is in this legislation, a bill which 
has some good features. There are some 
good things in it, but it also has some 
very bad features. 
The good news is that the reconcili-
ation bill finally begins to address the 
outrageous price of some of the most 
expensive 
prescription 
drugs 
under 
Medicare. As you know, we pay, by far, 
the highest prices in the world for our 
prescription drugs, and for those under 
Medicare, this begins to address that 
issue. 
Under this legislation, Medicare, for 
the first time, would be able to nego-
tiate with the pharmaceutical industry 
to lower drug prices. That is the good 
news. 
The bad news is that we will not see 
the impact of these negotiated prices 
until 2026—4 years from now. Why? Got 
me. I don’t know, but it will not go 
into effect until 4 years from now. 
By the way, the pharmaceutical in-
dustry is the most powerful entity here 
in DC, and if you think, during those 4 
years, that whatever modest provisions 
are in this bill they will not attack and 
get out, you would be mistaken. They 
will certainly work hard to do that, 
and they have 4 years to do that—4 
years to come up with an entire pricing 
structure—because if you are not cov-
ering all of the drugs, they can come 
up with me-too drugs that look alike, 
that sound alike, and that can evade 
these price controls. 
Moreover, with the possible excep-
tion of insulin—and that is not clear 
yet—this bill does nothing to lower 
prescription drug prices for anyone 
who is not on Medicare. 
Under this bill, at a time when phar-
maceutical companies are making out-
rageous profits, the drug companies 
will still be allowed to charge the 
American people, by far, the highest 
prices in the world for prescription 
drugs. 
Now, if we had the courage to seri-
ously address this issue, we would 
know exactly what to do. It is very, 
very simple. For over 30 years, the Vet-
erans Health Administration has been 
negotiating with the pharmaceutical 
industry to lower the price of prescrip-
tion drugs. Moreover, for decades, vir-
tually every major country on Earth 
has done exactly the same thing. That 
is why, in Canada, drug prices and, in 
Mexico, drug prices and, in Europe, 
drug prices are much lower than in the 
United States. 
The result of Medicare not negoti-
ating prices has been that, today, 
Medicare pays twice as much for the 
same exact prescription drugs as the 
VA, and Americans, in some cases, pay 
10 times more for a particular drug 
than the people in Canada or in other 
countries. 
How insane is it that you have one 
Federal Agency, called the VA, that 
pays 50 percent of what Medicare pays? 
I mean, how crazy is that? 
So, when it comes to reducing the 
price of prescription drugs under Medi-
care, we don’t have to reinvent the 
wheel. We could simply require Medi-
care to pay no more for prescription 
drugs than the VA pays—end of discus-
sion. It is a rather simple solution. If 
we did that, we could save Medicare 
some $900 billion over the next decade. 
That is nine times more savings than 
the rather weak negotiation provision 
in this bill—nine times more. They get 
$100 billion. We would save $900 billion. 
By the way, that money could be 
used to add comprehensive dental, vi-
sion, and hearing benefits to every sen-
ior in America; it could be used to 
lower the Medicare eligibility age to at 
least 60; and it could be used to extend 
the solvency of Medicare. 
That is why I will be introducing an 
amendment to do just that and to 
make sure that Medicare pays no more 
for prescription drugs than the VA. It 
is not a very radical idea, and I would 
hope that that amendment gets wide-
spread support. 
In terms of the Affordable Care Act, 
this legislation will extend subsidies 
for some 13 million Americans who 
have private health insurance plans, as 
a result of the ACA, over the next 3 
years. Without this provision, millions 
of Americans would see their premiums

skyrocket, and some 3 million Ameri-
cans could lose their health insurance 
altogether. 
This is a good provision, and I sup-
port it, but let us not kid ourselves. 
The $64 billion cost of this provision 
will go directly into the pockets of pri-
vate health insurance companies that 
made over $60 billion in profit last year 
and paid their CEOs exorbitant com-
pensation packages. 
It would also do nothing to help the 
more than 70 million Americans who 
are uninsured or underinsured, and it 
would do nothing to reform a dysfunc-
tional healthcare system that is not 
designed to make people well but is de-
signed to make the stockholders of pri-
vate health insurance companies even 
richer. 
Let me talk about the issue of cli-
mate change for a moment as it is 
dealt with in this bill. 
This legislation provides $370 billion 
over the next decade to combat climate 
change and to invest in so-called en-
ergy security programs. 
The good news is that, if this legisla-
tion, as written, is signed into law, it 
would provide far more funding for en-
ergy efficiency and sustainable energy 
than has ever been invested before. 
Given the existential crisis that we 
face—given the fact that we are fight-
ing to make sure that this planet re-
mains habitable and healthy for young-
er generations—this, clearly, is not 
enough of an investment, but it is a 
step forward. 
It provides serious funding for wind, 
solar, batteries, heat pumps, electric 
vehicles, energy-efficient appliances, 
and low-income communities that have 
borne the brunt of climate change. 
That is the good news. 
However, the bad news is that this 
legislation includes a huge giveaway to 
the fossil fuel industry—the people who 
are causing the climate crisis. 
Now, it might seem a bit incongruous 
to people as to why we are rewarding 
the people whose emissions are driving 
the temperature of the Earth up and 
causing massive destruction, but that 
is, in fact, what this bill does. 
Under this legislation, the fossil fuel 
industry will receive billions of dollars 
in new tax breaks and subsidies over 
the next 10 years on top of the $15 bil-
lion in tax breaks and corporate wel-
fare that they already receive every 
year. This is above and beyond what 
they currently get. 
In my view, if we are going to make 
our planet healthy and habitable for 
future generations, which I would hope 
that every sane human being believes 
we should, we cannot provide billions 
of dollars in new tax breaks to fossil 
fuel companies that are destroying the 
planet. On the contrary, we should end 
all of the massive corporate welfare 
that the fossil fuel industry already en-
joys. 
Under this legislation, up to 60 mil-
lion acres of public waters—60 million 
acres of public waters—must be offered 
up for sale each and every year to the 
oil and gas industry before the Federal 
Government could approve any new off-
shore wind development. To put this in 
perspective, 60 million acres is the size 
of Michigan. 
Let me read to you the headline that 
appeared in a July 29 article in 
Bloomberg called: ‘‘Exxon . . . Loves 
What Manchin Did for Big Oil in $370 
Billion Deal.’’ 
According to Bloomberg, the CEO of 
ExxonMobil called the reconciliation 
bill a ‘‘step in the right direction’’ and 
was ‘‘pleased’’ with the ‘‘comprehen-
sive set of solutions’’ included in the 
reconciliation bill. 
Barron’s 
recently 
reported 
that 
ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental 
Petroleum are just a few of the fossil 
fuel companies that would benefit the 
most under this bill. 
Now, if the CEO of ExxonMobil—a 
company that, perhaps, has done more 
than any other entity on Earth to 
cause climate change—is ‘‘pleased’’ 
with this bill, I think all of us should 
have some very deep concerns about 
what is in this legislation. 
Further, under this bill, up to 2 mil-
lion acres of public lands must be of-
fered up for sale each and every year to 
the oil and gas industry before leases 
can move forward for any renewable 
energy development on public lands. 
In total, this bill will offer the fossil 
fuel industry up to 700 million acres of 
public lands and waters to oil and gas 
drilling over the next decade—far more 
than the oil and gas industry could 
possibly use. 
That is not all. The fossil fuel indus-
try will not just benefit from the provi-
sions in this reconciliation bill. A deal 
has also been reached to make it easier 
for the industry to receive permits for 
their oil and gas projects. 
This deal would approve a $6.6 billion 
Mountain Valley Pipeline—a fracked 
gas pipeline that would span 303 miles 
from West Virginia to Virginia and po-
tentially on to North Carolina. This is 
a pipeline that would generate emis-
sions equivalent to that released by 37 
coal plants or by over 27 million cars 
each and every year. Well, to my mind, 
that is a heck of a way to address the 
climate crisis. 
Let me quote from a July 29 letter 
from over 350 environmental organiza-
tions, including the Sunrise Movement, 
Food & Water Watch, 350.org, and the 
Climate Justice Alliance, addressed to 
the President and the Senate majority 
leader, expressing concerns about this 
bill. 
This is what they say: 
Any approval of new fossil fuel projects or 
fast-tracking of fossil fuel permitting is in-
compatible with climate leadership. Oil, gas 
and coal production are the core drivers of 
the climate and extinction crises. There can 
be no new fossil fuel leases, exports, or infra-
structure if we have any hope of preventing 
ever-worsening climate crises, catastrophic 
floods, deadly wildfires, and more—all of 
which are ripping across the country as we 
speak. We are out of time. Therefore, we’re 
calling on you— 
the President and majority leader— 
to fulfill your promise to lead on climate, 
starting with denying approvals for the 
Mountain Valley Pipeline, rejecting all new 
federal fossil fuel leases onshore, in the Gulf 
of Mexico, in Alaska, and everywhere else, 
and preventing any fast-tracked permits for 
fossil fuel projects. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the 
letter 
by 
these 
360 
environmental 
groups written on July 29. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JULY 29, 2022. 
Re Hold the line against fossil fuel expan-
sion. 
DEAR
PRESIDENT
BIDEN
AND
MAJORITY 
LEADER SCHUMER: As frontline communities 
and organizations with millions of members 
and supporters, we thank you for your tire-
less efforts to secure a climate deal with 
meaningful renewable energy investments. 
At the same time, we respectfully urge you 
to reject any handouts to the fossil fuel in-
dustry. Put simply: you cannot address the 
climate emergency by sacrificing commu-
nities, expanding fossil fuel production and 
embracing fossil fuel industry scams like 
carbon capture, fossil fuel hydrogen, and car-
bon offsets. 
Any approval of new fossil fuel projects or 
fast-tracking of fossil fuel permitting is in-
compatible with climate leadership. Oil, gas 
and coal production are the core drivers of 
the climate and extinction crises. There can 
be no new fossil fuel leases, exports, or infra-
structure if we have any hope of preventing 
ever-worsening climate crises, catastrophic 
floods, deadly wildfires, and more—all of 
which are ripping across the country as we 
speak. We are out of time. Therefore, we’re 
calling on you to fulfill your promise to lead 
on climate, starting with denying approvals 
for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, rejecting 
all new federal fossil fuel leases onshore, in 
the Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska, and every-
where else, and preventing any fast-tracked 
permits for fossil fuel projects. 
Permitting new fossil fuel projects will 
further entrench us in a fossil fuel economy 
for decades to come—and constitutes a vio-
lent betrayal of your pledge to combat envi-
ronmental racism and destruction. Today’s 
high gasoline and energy prices cannot be 
solved with promises of future oil and gas 
production. Climate chaos harms every per-
son in America, but our communities bear 
the brunt of the deadly impacts of the toxic 
fossil fuel industry: primarily Indigenous, 
Black, Latinx, AAPI and other communities 
of color, as well as low-wealth communities. 
Young people, women, and so many others 
that turned out to elect you and gave you 
your mandate to govern need climate hope, 
not 
climate 
setbacks. 
New 
fossil 
fuel 
projects will also lock workers into a dying 
industry and delay the growth in sectors 
that will support jobs of the future. 
Critically, none of these negotiations af-
fect the need for President Biden to imme-
diately declare a climate emergency and use 
his existing authority to reject fossil fuel 
projects. Declaring a climate emergency will 
unlock President Biden’s full set of powers 
to not only release Defense funding to build 
renewable and just energy systems, but also 
confront fossil fuels head-on by stopping 
crude oil exports. With non-emergency pow-
ers, President Biden can reject new oil and 
gas leases, and deny all fossil fuel infrastruc-
ture that harms countless communities 
across the country. Unleashing executive 
powers should be pursued in concert with— 
and not instead of—passing critical climate 
legislation, and vice versa.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, here is 
what the Center for Biological Diver-
sity had to say on this bill: 
This is a climate suicide pact. It’s self-de-
feating to handcuff renewable energy devel-
opment to massive new oil and gas extrac-
tion. The new leasing required in this bill 
will fan the flames of the climate disasters 
torching our country, and it’s a slap in the 
face to the communities fighting to protect 
themselves from filthy fossil fuels. 
In my view, we have got to do every-
thing possible to take on the greed of 
the fossil fuel industry, not give bil-
lions of dollars in corporate welfare to 
an industry that has been actively de-
stroying our planet. And I will be in-
troducing an amendment to do just 
that. 
Finally, this bill has a tax provision 
in it. Under this bill, corporations will 
be required to pay a minimum tax of 15 
percent. That is good news because we 
have many, many large, profitable cor-
porations in this country, including 
companies like AT&T, Federal Express, 
and Nike, which, in a given year, make 
billions in profit and don’t pay a nickel 
in Federal income tax. This provision 
has been estimated to raise $313 billion 
over the next decade. 
Further, under this bill, the IRS will 
finally begin to receive the funding 
that it needs to audit wealthy tax 
cheats. Each and every year, the top 1 
percent are able to avoid paying more 
than $160 billion in taxes that they le-
gally owe because the IRS does not 
have the resources or staffing they 
need to conduct audits of the ex-
tremely wealthy. This bill will begin to 
change that. 
This bill would also make very mod-
est changes to the so-called carried in-
terest loophole that has allowed bil-
lionaire hedge fund managers on Wall 
Street to pay a lower tax rate than a 
nurse, a teacher, or a firefighter, and 
that is a good thing. 
But the bad news is that this bill 
does nothing to repeal the Trump tax 
breaks that went to the very wealthy 
and large corporations. Trump’s 2017 
tax bill provided over a trillion dollars 
in tax breaks to the top 1 percent and 
large corporations, and this bill does 
nothing to repeal that. 
Let’s not forget, it is very likely that 
Congress will be doing a so-called tax 
extenders bill at the end of this year 
that could provide corporations up to 
$400 billion over the next decade in new 
tax breaks. If that occurs, that would 
more than offset the $313 billion in cor-
porate revenue included in this bill. 
So that is where we are today. This 
legislation 
virtually 
ignores 
every 
major crisis facing working families 
who are struggling so very hard to stay 
alive today. It ignores childcare, pre-K, 
the expansion of Medicare, affordable 
housing, home healthcare, higher edu-
cation, raising the minimum wage, and 
more. It ignores all of those issues. 
This is legislation, which at a time of 
massive profits in the pharmaceutical 
industry, takes a very modest step, 
which goes into effect 4 years from 
now, to lower or control the price of 
medicine. 
So this bill has, as I have indicated, 
some good and important provisions. 
At the same time, it has some pretty 
bad provisions, including massive give-
aways to the fossil fuel industry. 
This is a bill of more than 700 pages, 
which was made public after a number 
of months of secret negotiations. In my 
view, now is the time for every Member 
of the Senate to study this bill thor-
oughly and to come up with amend-
ments and ideas as to how we can im-
prove it, and I intend to play an active 
role in that process. 
I yield the floor.
