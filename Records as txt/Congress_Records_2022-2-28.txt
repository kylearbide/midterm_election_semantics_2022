PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, You were working on us 
before we even knew to look for You. 
You have put people, situations, and 
events in our lives to draw us to your-
self, that we would come to know You 
and appreciate Your steadfast love for 
us. 
Continue to open our eyes that we 
may see Your masterful hand at work. 
As we gaze about us, may we look with 
Your eyes to see how You are reflected 
in the faces of those who share in cre-
ation with us. 
Give us the insight to understand 
how certain challenges we have faced 
have strengthened us to serve You bet-
ter, to understand that our pain has 
given us empathy that we would be 
better suited to attend to the suffering 
of others. 
Enable us to seize the opportunities 
You have put before us that allow us to 
participate in Your creative purpose, 
to appreciate and respect Your willing-
ness to trust us with your handiwork. 
In responding to You, may we prove 
to be good and faithful stewards in the 
care and tending of the gracious gifts 
we have received by Your hand. 
We offer this prayer in Your most 
holy name. 
Amen.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will take this occasion to update 
the Speaker’s announced policies of 
January 4, 2021, regarding the require-
ment to wear masks in the Hall of the 
House during the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
Consistent with updated guidance 
from the Attending Physician, the 
Chair wishes to inform Members that 
masks are no longer required in the 
Hall of the House. The Chair would fur-
ther note that all Members and staff 
may continue to wear masks at their

nounced policies that are in conflict. 
The Chair appreciates the attention 
of Members to this matter and expects 
Members to continue to respect the 
health and safety of other Members 
and staff during this ongoing pan-
demic, including by following current 
and future guidance of the Attending

SUPPORTING PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKY 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, last week, 
I led a bipartisan group to visit Lith-
uania and the OSCE meeting in Vi-
enna, Austria. 
In Lithuania, we met with the lead-
ers and assured them of America’s Ar-
ticle 5 responsibilities and commit-
ments in case Russia comes into Lith-
uania. They are very concerned. 
We met with our troops, who are 6 
kilometers away from Russian troops 
stationed in Belarus. We then went to 
the OSCE in Vienna, and we led a 
strong response to support Ukraine and 
oppose an unbelievable invasion by the 
cruel Vladimir Putin. 
The European community is united, 
except for Russia and Belarus, in op-
posing the intrusion. Vladimir Putin is 
not operating in a rational manner. His 
KGB history and his extreme response 
to COVID have driven him to a delu-
sional, paranoid, and dangerous state. 
It concerns all. 
I appreciate the actions of our Presi-
dent in supporting our country. I sup-
port President Zelensky, who is the 
Maccabee of his era, but the candle has 
only lasted so long. We need to get him 
more oil.

ENERGY INDEPENDENCE MEANS 
NATIONAL SECURITY 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, right now, we are witnessing 
the violent acts of a Russian dictator 
in Eastern Europe. Vladimir Putin is 
attempting to rehang the Iron Curtain, 
murdering innocent women and chil-
dren who stand in his path. 
To help put an end to the war, Amer-
ica must stand united with the free 
people of Ukraine and continue to pro-
vide them with the lethal aid that they 
need to defend themselves. 
It is time for the United States to 
stop the flow of Russian oil to the rest 
of the world and impose harsh sanc-
tions against Russia and its leaders. 
Vladimir Putin and corrupt Russian 
oligarchs must know that they will pay 
a steep price for their unwarranted ag-
gression. It is time for President Biden 
to allow for America to become energy 
independent again and share our re-
sources across the world. 
Energy independence means national 
security. Now is the time to promote 
American energy, and now is the time 
to stand with the Ukrainian people.

HONORING IOWA STATE 
WRESTLING CHAMPIONS 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the accom-
plishments of seven young men from 
Iowa’s Second Congressional District. 
Timothy 
Koester 
of 
Bettendorf, 
Marcel Lopez of New London, Hunter 
Garvin of Iowa City West, Eric Kinkaid 
of Camanche, Blaine Frazier and C.J. 
Walrath of Burlington Notre Dame, 
and Ben Kueter of Iowa City earned the 
title of State champion at the Iowa 
State wrestling championships earlier 
this month. 
Wrestling holds a special place in the 
homes of many across Iowa, and these 
young men should be incredibly proud 
of their achievements. Through hard 
work and dedication, these student- 
athletes were able to dominate their 
competition and bring home victory to 
their school, family, and community. 
These young men proved that the 
possibilities are endless if you work 
hard enough. Congratulations to all of 
our State champions.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
FAILURES 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, President 
Zelensky of Ukraine is a rock-ribbed 
leader who will fight and deliver for his 
country, and Americans are standing 
with the Ukrainians, who are fighting 
so bravely for their country. 
It is damning that Americans can’t 
say the same for the person who is sup-
posed to be the leader of the free world 
as we can for President Zelensky. 
Our leader kneecapped American en-
ergy production by eliminating the 
Keystone XL pipeline and empowered 
Putin by waiving sanctions on the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline in Europe. Due to 
that abysmal decision, the U.S. is now 
explicitly not targeting Russia’s en-
ergy sector with sanctions. It is as if he 
wanted America to be dependent on 
Putin and autocrats in Russia indefi-
nitely. 
We could have done more to stop 
what has happened in Ukraine. Ameri-
cans support the Ukrainians and want 
to see a change in our energy policy. 
What is happening now is damaging 
our country and our standing in the 
free world.

‘‘SIX 
TRIPLE 
EIGHT’’ 
CONGRES-
SIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 321) to award a Congressional 
Gold Medal to the members of the 
Women’s Army Corps who were as-
signed to the 6888th Central Postal Di-
rectory Battalion, known as the ‘‘Six 
Triple Eight’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 321 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ ‘Six Triple 
Eight’ Congressional Gold Medal Act of 
2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt signed into law legislation that es-
tablished the Women’s Army Corps (referred 
to in this section as the ‘‘WAC’’) as a compo-
nent in the Army. The WAC was converted 
from the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘WAAC’’), 
which had been created in 1942 without offi-
cial military status. First Lady Eleanor Roo-
sevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune, the found-
er of the National Council of Negro Women, 
advocated for the admittance of African- 
American women into the newly formed 
WAC to serve as officers and enlisted per-
sonnel. 
(2) Dubbed ‘‘10 percenters’’, the recruit-
ment of African-American women to the 
WAAC was limited to 10 percent of the popu-
lation of the WAAC to match the proportion 
of African-Americans in the national popu-
lation. Despite an Executive order issued by 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 ban-
ning racial discrimination in civilian defense 
industries, the Armed Forces remained seg-
regated. Enlisted women served in seg-
regated units, participated in segregated 
training, lived in separate quarters, ate at 
separate tables in mess halls, and used seg-
regated recreational facilities. Officers re-
ceived their officer candidate training in in-
tegrated units but lived under segregated 
conditions. Specialist and technical training 
schools were integrated in 1943. During 
World War II, a total of 6,520 African-Amer-
ican women served in the WAAC and the 
WAC. 
(3) After several units of White women 
were sent to serve in the European Theater 
of Operations (referred to in this section as 
the ‘‘ETO’’) during World War II, African- 
American organizations advocated for the 
War Department to extend the opportunity 
to serve overseas to African-American WAC 
units. 
(4) In November 1944, the War Department 
approved sending African-American women 
to serve in Europe. A battalion of all Afri-
can-American women drawn from the WAC, 
the Army Service Forces, and the Army Air 
Forces was created and designated as the 
6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion 
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘6888th’’), 
which 
was 
nicknamed 
the 
‘‘Six 
Triple 
Eight’’. 
(5) Army officials reported a shortage of 
qualified postal officers within the ETO, 
which resulted in a backlog of undelivered 
mail. As Allied forces drove across Europe, 
the 
ever-changing 
locations 
of 
servicemembers hampered the delivery of 
mail 
to 
those 
servicemembers. 
Because 
7,000,000 civilians and military personnel 
from the United States served in the ETO, 
many of those individuals had identical 
names. For example, 7,500 such individuals 
were named Robert Smith. One general pre-
dicted that the backlog in Birmingham, Eng-
land, would take 6 months to process and the 
lack of reliable mail service was hurting mo-
rale. 
(6) In February 1945, the 6888th arrived in 
Birmingham. Upon their arrival, the 6888th 
found warehouses filled with millions of 
pieces of mail intended for members of the 
Armed Forces, United States Government 
personnel, and Red Cross workers serving in 
the ETO. 
(7) The 6888th created effective processes 
and filing systems to track individual 
servicemembers, organize ‘‘undeliverable’’ 
mail, determine the intended recipient for 
insufficiently addressed mail, and handle 
mail addressed to servicemembers who had 
died. Adhering to their motto of ‘‘No mail, 
low morale’’, the women processed an aver-
age of 65,000 pieces of mail per shift and 
cleared the 6-month backlog of mail within 3 
months. 
(8) The 6888th traveled to Rouen, France, in 
May 1945 and worked through a separate

backlog of undelivered mail dating back as 
far as 3 years. 
(9) At the completion of their mission, the 
unit returned to the United States. The 
6888th was discontinued on March 9, 1946, at 
Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. 
(10) The accomplishments of the 6888th in 
Europe 
encouraged 
the 
General 
Board, 
United States Forces, European Theater of 
Operations to adopt the following premise in 
their study of the WAC issued in December 
1945: ‘‘[T]he national security program is the 
joint responsibility of all Americans irre-
spective of color or sex’’ and ‘‘the continued 
use of colored, along with white, female mili-
tary personnel is required in such strength 
as is proportionately appropriate to the rel-
ative population distribution between col-
ored and white races’’. 
(11) With the exception of smaller units of 
African-American nurses who served in Afri-
ca, Australia, and England, the 6888th was 
the only African-American Women’s Army 
Corps unit to serve overseas during World 
War II. 
(12) The members of the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ 
received the European African Middle East-
ern Campaign Medal, the Women’s Army 
Corps Service Medal, and the World War II 
Victory Medal for their service. 
(13) In 2019, the Army awarded the 6888th 
the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to in-
clude 
extraneous 
material 
in 
the 
RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The 855 women of the 6888th Central 
Postal 
Directory 
Battalion, 
better 
known as the Six Triple Eight, were 
given a mission to sort a 2-year back-
log of mail consisting of millions of 
letters. But these women did more 
than just sort and distribute this back-
log in record time. As the largest con-
tingent of African-American women to 
serve overseas during World War II, the 
Six Triple Eight demonstrated success-
fully that African-American women 
could and should be included in the 
ranks of the military. 
Throughout their time overseas, the 
Six Triple Eight had a motto: ‘‘No 
mail, low morale.’’ Beginning in Feb-
ruary 1945, with their arrival in Bir-
mingham, England, the Six Triple 
Eight perfected their sorting processes, 
setting up three 8-hour shifts running 7 
days a week. At peak efficiency, they 
processed for delivery 65,000 pieces of 
mail per shift. 
Army leadership estimated it would 
take between 6 months and a year to 
clear the backlog of mail. The women 
of the Six Triple Eight did it in 3 
months. 
The Six Triple Eight were then 
moved to Rouen, France, where they 
continued their mission, often working 
in cold, dark, and damp conditions and 
alongside German prisoners of war and 
French civilians. 
Finally, this group of women was 
moved to Paris, where they remained, 
sorting and distributing mail to Amer-
ican troops through May 1946. In all, 
the Six Triple Eight were estimated to 
have distributed 17 million pieces of 
mail. 
Yet, despite their important con-
tributions to boosting troop morale 
and their work to dispel racist stereo-
types within the military of the value 
and dedication of African-American 
women in the armed services, the ac-
complishments of the women of the Six 
Triple Eight went unrecognized for dec-
ades. This bill is small, but it is a sig-
nificant step toward ensuring the Six 
Triple Eight’s contributions are ac-
knowledged and widely celebrated. 
The bill directs the United States 
Mint to strike a Congressional Gold 
Medal in honor of the women of the Six 
Triple Eight Central Postal Directory 
Battalion in recognition of their pio-
neering military service and contribu-
tions to increasing the morale of all 
American personnel stationed in Eu-
rope by ensuring no mail from loved 
ones was left undelivered. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of S. 321, the ‘‘Six 
Triple 
Eight’’ 
Congressional 
Gold 
Medal Act. 
Mr. Speaker, with our world so inter-
connected today, we can sometimes 
forget how big the role of mail played 
in our daily lives before electronic 
technology came about. This especially 
rings true for those who left home to 
defend our Nation in times of war. 
As stated by the Smithsonian’s Na-
tional Postal Museum: ‘‘For members 
of the Armed Forces, the importance of 
mail during World War II was second 
only to food. The emotional power of 
letters was heightened by the fear of 
loss and the need for communication 
during times of separation.’’ 
The importance of morale-boosting 
letters was well-known back home in 
the United States, and many answered 
the call to send letters to the U.S. mili-
tary fighting in the Great War. How-
ever, getting these letters to the Amer-
icans on the front lines was an arduous 
task. 
By February 1945, warehouses in Bir-
mingham, England, had a backlog of 
millions of pieces of mail. This is 
where the Six Triple Eight Central 
Postal 
Directory 
Battalion 
forever 
changed history. 
Going back a bit, on July 1, 1943, 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed into 
law legislation that established the 
Women’s Army Corps, better known as 
WACs. Early on, this corps consisted of 
only White women, and even when Af-
rican-American women were admitted 
into the WACs, the recruitment was 
limited to only 10 percent. 
Additionally, those who did enlist 
served in segregated units; they par-
ticipated in segregated training; and

they lived in segregated areas. Despite 
the overt racism and segregation, a 
total of 6,520 brave African-American 
women served in the Women’s Army 
Corps. 
In November 1944, despite slow re-
cruitment of volunteers, a battalion of 
817—and later, 824—enlisted personnel 
and 31 officers, all African-American 
women drawn from the WAC, the Army 
Service Forces, and the Army Air 
Forces, was created and eventually des-
ignated as the Six Triple Eight Central 
Postal Directory Battalion. 
Upon arriving in Birmingham, the 
unit got right to work creating effec-
tive processes and filing systems to 
track servicemembers and organize 
‘‘undeliverable’’ mail. They were so ef-
ficient that they cleared a 6-month to 
a year backlog in only 3 months. 
Spurred on by their motto, ‘‘No mail, 
low 
morale,’’ 
these 
brave 
women 
cleared an average 65,000 pieces of mail 
per shift, ensuring that our service-
members had the ability to hear from 
loved ones back at home and to sustain 
the high morale that was needed. 
Since World War II, the Six Triple 
Eight has received the European Afri-
can Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, 
the 
Women’s 
Army 
Corps 
Service 
Medal, and the World War II Victory 
Medal for their service. Today, we 
should add the Congressional Gold 
Medal to this distinguished list. 
I would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to thank Representative GWEN 
MOORE from Wisconsin, the author of 
H.R. 1012, for her work to bring rec-
ognition to these brave women. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask my friend from Ohio—and I thank 
him for his remarks—if he has any 
other speakers. If not, I was hoping Ms. 
MOORE would be here, but I am pre-
pared to close. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I believe we are in a period of dueling 
reserves, trying to accommodate col-
leagues who are en route. But I would 
elaborate. As a prior enlisted service-
member, never serving in a field of 
combat, just getting a letter from 
home when you were away on a deploy-
ment, or even from the very moment 
you went to basic training, in those 
days, you didn’t have cell phones, text 
messages, emails, instant messages, 
web chat rooms and all these things, so 
your lifeline was the postal service. 
Frankly, I owe to the mail service 
that delivered letters to me while I was 
a cadet at West Point a big part of the 
courtship that led to me marrying my 
wife. We dated the whole time we were 
there. We looked forward to letters. We 
did have pay phones back then, so you 
would wait in line for the pay phone 
that augmented the letters. 
It is heroic what these women did, as 
we think about other things that have 
changed, thankfully, the period of time 
where it was looked upon with skep-
ticism that women could serve in our 
military, or African Americans, men or 
women, in any other way could serve. 
The idea that they were segregated in 
every way through this whole period of 
history is, I think, shocking to people 
today. 
But this was really a key piece of our 
history in allowing this transition. So 
I think it is fitting that they are recog-
nized with the Congressional Gold 
Medal, and I encourage, once again, all 
of our colleagues to support this bill. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his personal 
remarks about how important the 
mail—receiving 
mail 
and 
receiving 
communication—is. 
There were 7 million people in the 
European theater during World War II, 
and there were many names that were 
exactly the same that these women had 
to sort through. In fact, there were 
some 7,500 individuals named ‘‘Robert 
Smith,’’ and they had to figure out pre-
cisely who was to receive what mail. 
They did this, and they did this in very 
difficult environments and were able to 
provide the morale that was so key to 
all of these soldiers, sailors, and air-
men and -women in their service. 
So I suggest to my friend from Ohio 
that we close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
DAVIDSON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
would just conclude by saying yes, I 
am prepared to close, and I urge all of 
my colleagues to support S. 321. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. MFUME). 
b 1500 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the distinguished gentleman for 
yielding a little bit of time here at the 
conclusion of this discussion. I want to 
thank particularly the gentlewoman 
from Wisconsin for coming up with this 
bill on the House side and obviously 
those on the Senate side that support 
it. 
I can’t say enough about the need 
here to do the right thing in awarding 
this Congressional Gold Medal to the 
members of the Women’s Army Corps 
who were assigned to the 6888th Cen-
tral Postal Directory Battalion. It was 
a total of 855 Black women. 
It was 1944 and 1945. They went to 
serve their country with distinction 
and to make sure that that war would 
somehow guarantee rights to all Amer-
icans, many of the rights that they did 
not have themselves. 
They were the largest contingent of 
Black women to be deployed overseas, 
and they worked 7 days a week. As was 
stated earlier, 7 days a week was not 
even enough for many of those who 
witnessed what they were doing. 
The Army, by its own admission, fig-
ured that the work that would be be-
fore them would take months and 
months and months. We all know now, 
as a result of history, that was not the 
case. They worked tirelessly to support 
the mail that was going both ways at a 
time when we didn’t have internet and 
we didn’t have all of the ways to com-
municate today. 
So I congratulate them as a sterling 
group. There are just a few that are 
still alive, well into their nineties 
today. I urge passage of this very, very 
important piece of legislation. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado has the only 
time remaining. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Would the gen-
tleman 
consider 
yielding 
to 
Mr. 
LATURNER? 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Ohio be-
cause I thought we were all finished, 
but obviously there are other speakers 
and there is time on both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the 
gentleman from Ohio seek unanimous 
consent to reclaim his time? 
Mr. DAVIDSON. I do. 
The Speaker pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman reclaims his 
time and is recognized. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Kan-
sas (Mr. LATURNER). 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of this legislation to award 
a Congressional Gold Medal to the 
Women’s Army Corps 6888th Central 
Postal Directory Battalion. 
In 1943, President Franklin D. Roo-
sevelt signed legislation that created 
the Women’s Army Corps, and with the 
help of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt 
and Mary McCloud Bethune, the oppor-
tunity to serve in overseas units was 
soon extended to African-American 
women and the Six Triple Eight unit 
was born. 
The Six Triple Eight began their 
service in 1945 and were stationed in 
areas throughout England and France. 
Despite 
the 
dangerous 
conditions, 
these brave women helped sort and de-
liver millions of vital pieces of mail to 
soldiers on the front lines and helped 
quickly eliminate a 6-month backlog 
at several mail stations. 
I am honored to help introduce this 
legislation to award the Six Triple 
Eight with the highest honor in Con-
gress, the Congressional Gold Medal, 
for their heroic service to our Nation. 
I want to thank my colleague, Con-
gresswoman MOORE, for leading this ef-
fort in the House and my fellow Kan-
san, Senator MORAN, for helping get 
this bill across the finish line in the 
Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill that gives these heroic 
women the recognition they deserve. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE), the spon-
sor of this bill. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding, 
and I want to thank my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle who have worked

tirelessly to get the supermajority nec-
essary to consider S. 321 to award a 
Congressional Gold Medal to the Wom-
en’s Army Corps 6888th Central Postal 
Directory Battalion. 
Let me just say that I am so pleased 
to be a sponsor of this bill, particularly 
as we end Black History Month, hon-
oring these women, and as we begin 
Women’s History Month. The intersec-
tion of those two things is certainly a 
very appropriate time to mention the 
Six Triple Eight. 
You have heard about the heroic ef-
forts of this only-Black-female bat-
talion in history that served in World 
War II who are being honored here 
today. They are being honored because 
their heroic efforts enabled them, as a 
central battalion for the delivery of 
mail, to give people that little measure 
of a piece of home when they were 
away. 
I just have to ask my colleagues: 
When there are 7,500 Robert Smiths 
who weren’t able to get their mail dur-
ing World War II, who did they call? 
The Six Triple Eight, Black women. 
When they were coming under fire 
and there were 17-and-a-half million 
pieces of mail that were backlogged 
and couldn’t be sent to these soldiers, 
who they did call? Oh, yeah, the Six 
Triple Eight. 
When mothers were worried that 
their sons and wives were worried that 
their husbands had lost connection, 
who kept that connection going? The 
Six Triple Eight. 
Their motto was ‘‘no mail, low mo-
rale.’’ They weren’t just sorting mail. 
They were, in the words of Judi Glaeser 
printed in the Niagara Gazette on May 
21, 2021: 
Their work was more than sorting mail. It 
was ministering to the souls of soldiers, 
making sure they received that piece of 
home that reminded them that they were 
not forgotten. 
Today, we are not forgetting them. 
I say, in the name of my constituent, 
who is still alive and will be enjoying 
her 98th birthday on March 5, Anna 
Mae Robertson, I congratulate her on 
this gold medal. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Wisconsin. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, I just want to enter into the RECORD 
the names of First Lieutenant Fannie 
Griffin McClendon of Arizona; Corporal 
Lena Derriecott Bell King of Las 
Vegas, 
Nevada; 
Private 
Catherine 
Romay Davis of Alabama; Private 
Hilda Griggs of New Jersey; and Pri-
vate Crensencia Garcia of the Bronx, 
New York, who are still alive. 
And to the son of their leader, Major 
Charity Adams, I thank the Major for 
leading the Six Triple Eight to this 
great victory today. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. I 
thank the sponsor of this bill and the 
passion she always brings to this floor. 
I also thank the sponsor of the bill in 
the Senate, Senator MORAN from Kan-
sas. I thank everybody for their hard 
work in ensuring the women of the Six 
Triple Eight receive the recognition 
they so richly deserve. 
As Drexel University historian Greg-
ory S. Cooke notes: They knew what 
they did would reflect on all other 
Black people. The Tuskegee Airmen, 
the Six Triple Eight, represented all 
Black people. Had they failed, all 
Black people would be seen to have 
failed. That was part of the thinking 
going into the war. The Black battal-
ions had the burden that their role in 
the war was about something much 
bigger than themselves. 
The women of the Six Triple Eight 
fought a battle indeed greater than the 
warehouses stacked to the ceiling with 
bags and bags of undelivered mail and 
ensuring our Nation’s soldiers received 
letters from back home. It was also a 
battle for equality and for recognition 
and respect from their fellow Ameri-
cans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I rise in support of S. 
321, the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ Congressional Gold 
Medal Act, which would award Congressional 
Gold Medals to the members of the Women’s 
Army Corps who were assigned to the 6888th 
Central Postal Directory Battalion, known as 
the ‘‘Six Triple Eight.’’ 
S. 321, the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ Congressional 
Gold Medal Act, directs the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives and the President 
pro tempore of the Senate to arrange for the 
award of a Congressional Gold Medal in honor 
of the women of the 6888th Central Postal Di-
rectory Battalion in recognition of their pio-
neering military service, devotion to duty, and 
contributions to increase the morale of per-
sonnel stationed in the European theater of 
operations during World War II. 
On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. Roo-
sevelt signed into law legislation that estab-
lished the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) as a 
component of the Army. 
First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary 
McLeod Bethune, the founder of the National 
Council of Negro Women, advocated for the 
admittance of African-American women into 
the newly formed WAC to serve as officers 
and enlisted personnel. 
As a result of their efforts, the ‘‘Six Triple 
Eight’’ formed an all-Black battalion of the 
Women’s Army Corps. 
The 6888th had 855 Black women, both en-
listed and officers, and was led by Major Char-
ity Adams. 
Most of the 6888th worked as postal clerks, 
but others were cooks, mechanics and held 
other support positions, making the 6888th a 
self-sufficient unit. 
During World War II, there was a significant 
shortage of soldiers who were able to manage 
the postal service for the U.S. Army overseas. 
The 6888th left the United States on Feb-
ruary 3, 1945, sailing on Iˆle de France and ar-
rived in Glasgow on February 12. 
When the 6888th arrived in Birmingham on 
February 15, 1945, ‘‘they saw letters stacked 
to the ceiling of the temporary post office, 
some letters had been in the offices for as 
long as two years.’’ 
Army officials believed that undelivered mail 
was ‘‘hurting morale.’’ 
Early in the operation, a White general sent 
a White officer to ‘‘tell them how to do it right,’’ 
but Major Adams responded, ‘‘Sir, over my 
dead body, sir!’’ 
The battalion finished what was supposed to 
be a six-month task in three months in May 
1945. 
The women of the 6888th worked in three 
different shifts, seven days a week, processing 
and delivering mail—a morale booster—to the 
troops in Europe. 
The 6888th was a segregated unit, sleeping 
and eating in different locations from the 
White, male soldiers. 
European ‘‘locals’’ treated them better than 
other American soldiers did, which was the ex-
perience of most Black troops who served dur-
ing WWI and WWII. 
Once the backlog in Birmingham had been 
dealt with, the 6888th were shipped across the 
Channel to Le Havre in May 1945 and were 
sent to Rouen, where they dealt with another 
backlog of mail, with some letters being three 
years old. 
In February 1946, the unit returned to the 
United States where it was disbanded at Fort 
Dix, New Jersey. 
There was no public recognition for their 
service at the time. 
On February 25, 2009, the battalion was 
honored at the Women in Military Service for 
America Memorial at Arlington National Ceme-
tery. 
Alyce Dixon and Mary Raglan, two former 
unit members were honored by President 
Barack Obama and first lady, Michelle Obama 
in 2009. 
The extraordinary accomplishments of this 
unit are deserving of official congressional rec-
ognition and the United States is eternally 
grateful to the soldiers of the 6888th Central 
Postal Directory Battalion during World War II, 
which saved lives, boosted morale and made 
significant contributions to the defeat of the 
Axis powers. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legisla-
tion and urge all Members to vote for S. 321, 
the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ Congressional Gold 
Medal Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
PERLMUTTER) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, S. 321. 
The question was taken.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 3706. This bill makes important 
corrections to the recently passed Se-
cure Rural Schools reauthorization. 
Without these corrections, counties 
would not have the choice of electing 
to receive SRS payments or electing to 
receive Federal timber harvest re-
ceipts. Rather, they would have to take 
SRS payments. 
Furthermore, the current reauthor-
ization does not allow counties to elect 
their allocations in advance of their 
fiscal year 2021 payments, meaning all 
eligible counties would receive 80 per-
cent Title I funds, 20 percent Title II 
funds, and no Title III funds. 
While Title I payments, used for 
roads and schools, will be the bulk of 
the payment either way, it is impor-
tant to ensure that counties get access 
to Title III funds. Title III funds are 
important because they can be used for 
specified county purposes. These pur-
poses can include law enforcement on 
Federal land, search and rescue, and 
wildfire risk reduction. 
This fix will help timber-dependent 
counties across the country and ensure 
continued support for roads, schools, 
law enforcement, and environmental 
benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 3706. Under longtime Federal law, 
counties located within the National 
Forest System have received a share of 
revenues generated through the sale of 
timber harvested from those Federal 
lands. 
This revenue has been critical for for-
ested counties to support schools, 
roads, law enforcement, search-and- 
rescue operations, and other local ac-
tivities that benefit both our forests 
and rural communities. 
However, with the sharp decline in 
timber harvesting across the National 
Forest System since the early 1990s, 
rural counties have seen revenues for 
schools and other important local serv-
ices plummet as a result. 
To offset this lost revenue, Congress 
created the Secure Rural Schools pro-
gram in 2000 to provide additional fund-
ing to participating counties based on 
their average historical timber pay-
ments. 
In my own district in north Florida, 
Putnam County and Marion County 
have received a combined total of more 
than $624,000 through the Secure Rural 
Schools program, thanks to the sale of 
timber harvested out of the Ocala Na-
tional Forest. 
b 1515 
In rural counties like Putnam, this 
funding provides support for the coun-
ty’s schools, roads, and other critical 
services. It is no different in Marion 
County. 
The recent infrastructure bill, signed 
into law this past November, reauthor-
ized the Secure Rural Schools for the 
next 3 years. However, due to a draft-
ing error, this reauthorization did not 
lock in the payment allocations that 
participating counties last elected in 
2013. 
Consequently, 
payments 
for 
this 
spring will revert to their default lev-
els in permanent law. This means that 
county allocations will revert to 80 per-
cent for Title I, 20 percent for Title II, 
and zero percent for Title III. 
To correct this problem, S. 3706 will 
lock in the 2013 elections for the com-
ing year. In doing so, the bill will pro-
vide certainty and consistency for 
county payments that will be made in 
the coming months. 
Fundamental errors like this dem-
onstrate how flawed and rushed the 
process was to pass the infrastructure 
bill this last year. It also demonstrates 
the need for committee consideration 
and why committees should not be by-
passed before bringing a bill to the 
floor. 
However, given the great importance 
of county payments to both forested 
counties and rural school districts 
around the Nation, I support this com-
monsense technical fix and urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
As we continue to consider how to 
best steward our national forests and 
support forested communities, I would 
like to add that increasing timber har-
vesting across the National Forest Sys-
tem will better support these counties 
and reduce the need for this program in 
the long run. 
Regardless of what the critics say, 
timber harvesting will encourage forest 
health and will help prevent the dev-
astating 
wildfires 
that 
have 
torn 
through America’s forests in recent 
years. Our forests are an important pil-
lar for our rural economies and provide 
much-needed revenue to our local 
counties and schools, like those in my 
own district. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time and urge 
adoption of this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CORREA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 3706. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1157 
February 28, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
854, the Methamphetamine Response 
Act of 2021. 
Today, our Nation continues to face 
a devastating epidemic of substance 
use and overdose deaths, an epidemic 
that has only been exacerbated by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. During the pan-
demic, we have surpassed the tragic 
milestone of 100,000 drug overdose 
deaths in a 1-year period. 
Although opioids account for a sig-
nificant number of overdose deaths, 
methamphetamine overdoses have been 
rising at alarming rates in recent 
years. Recent data from the National 
Institutes of Health found that meth-
amphetamine overdose deaths nearly 
tripled from 2015 to 2019. 
Further, the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration reports that methamphet-
amine continues to be readily available 
throughout the United States. In 2019, 
the DEA seized over 53,000 kilograms of 
methamphetamine. That was a 55 per-
cent increase over 2018. Recent data 
also suggests that seizures of meth-
amphetamine have increased during 
the pandemic. The threat of this drug 
is compounded by the common mixing, 
or cutting, of drugs, such as cocaine, 
with methamphetamine. 
To address the widespread avail-
ability and the shocking increases in 
methamphetamine-involved 
overdose 
deaths, this legislation would designate 
methamphetamine as an emerging drug 
threat. 
By making this designation, Mr. 
Speaker, S. 854 would require the Office 
of National Drug Control Policy to im-
plement a methamphetamine response 
plan. As part of this plan, ONDCP and 
partner agencies would develop a com-
prehensive assessment of the emerging 
drug 
threat, 
establish 
quantifiable 
goals to combat the threat, implement 
performance measures, and identify the 
funding levels needed to implement the 
plan. 
The House companion of this bill was 
considered and passed by the Energy 
and Commerce Committee with bipar-
tisan support in July of last year. I 
commend the sponsors of the House 
companion, 
Representatives 
PETERS 
and CURTIS, for their leadership. 
This legislation is another step for-
ward in our ongoing efforts to end the 
substance use epidemic that is dev-
astating our families and communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 854, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
854, the Methamphetamine Response 
Act. The companion version of this 
bill, H.R. 2051, was led by Representa-
tives 
PETERS, 
CURTIS, 
and 
HARSHBARGER in the House. 
Methamphetamine is a highly addict-
ive stimulant that is illicitly traf-
ficked throughout the United States. 
This dangerous substance is associated 
with psychosis, cardiovascular dysfunc-
tion, infectious disease transmission, 
and overdose. The Drug Enforcement 
Administration even issued a public 
safety alert for the first time in 6 years 
in September 2021 warning Americans 
about the increase in the lethality of 
fake 
prescription 
pills 
containing 
fentanyl and methamphetamine. 
In response to recent trends and 
alarming increases in methamphet-
amine-involved overdose deaths, S. 854 
would designate methamphetamine as 
an emerging drug threat and would di-
rect the Office of National Drug Con-
trol Policy to develop a methamphet-
amine response plan. The development 
and the implementation of this plan 
will help coordinate efforts across the 
Federal Government to more effec-
tively 
address 
this 
emerging 
drug 
threat. 
I will say, we absolutely have to have 
this in place, but it stops at the source. 
I was able in early January to go to the 
border, and I was outside of El Paso— 
actually in New Mexico, but outside of 
El Paso. The Border Patrol agents took 
me to the point where, on January 20, 
2021, they ceased building the wall; and 
they said this is where a lot of the 
drugs are flowing through, and they 
were talking about meth, and they 
were also talking about fentanyl. 
Fentanyl, as we know, mostly origi-
nates in China, but it comes through 
Mexico, so it is just a failure of so 
many 
different 
policies. 
It 
comes 
through Mexico and comes across the 
border. They said because of the vol-
ume of people coming up through the 
border without the remain in Mexico 
policy and the wall that it is numbers. 
If hundreds of people are coming, and 
we can catch 20 percent of them; and 
you can put fentanyl—I know we are 
talking about methamphetamine, but 
it 
comes 
together—you 
can 
put 
fentanyl in a water bottle and bring it 
through. 
We are doing this bill today, which is 
great, but if the CR expires on March 
11, illicit fentanyl and fentanyl ana-
logues will be street-legal in the 
United States. This committee needs 
to bring the HALT Fentanyl Act to the 
floor 
and 
permanently 
ban 
illicit 
fentanyl. Seventy percent of all over-
dose deaths in Kentucky in 2020 were 
from illicit fentanyl. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill. This is a serious bill. I actually 
had a sheriff from Nelson County, Ken-
tucky, who was visiting, and he said: 
We can tell the price—because they do 
the controlled buys—in the amount of 
money I have to use to buy meth, the 
cost, I can tell you what has happened 
at the border because if it is low, it 
means we are flooded with it because 
the border is not in control, and right 
now the price is so low, the only thing 
that my drug enforcement officers have 
said to me is that, well, there is no 
longer any meth labs or many meth 
labs, if any, in rural Kentucky because 
so much is coming from Mexico it has 
put them out of business. So they don’t 
have to go clean up meth labs as they 
find them, but it is a tough consola-
tion. 
We need to pass this bill, and we also 
need to pass the HALT Fentanyl Act. 
We need to get control of our southern 
border to keep these drugs from flow-
ing into the country illegally to begin 
with. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no additional 
speakers, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for this bill, which is bipar-
tisan, so we can send it to the Presi-
dent. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of S. 854, the ‘‘Methamphet-
amine Response Act of 2021’’ which des-
ignates methamphetamine as an emerging 
drug threat (a new and growing trend in the 
use of an illicit drug or class of drug). 
It also directs the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy to implement a methamphet-
amine response plan. 
Methamphetamines are a highly addictive 
substance that can cause considerable health 
adversities which can sometimes result in 
death. 
Meth not only changes how the brain works, 
but also speeds up the body’s systems to dan-
gerous, sometimes lethal, levels—increasing 
blood pressure and heart and respiratory 
rates. 
People who repeatedly use meth may also 
experience anxiety, paranoia, aggression, hal-
lucinations, and mood disturbances. 
According to the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse, the misuse of methamphetamine re-
mains an extremely serious problem in the 
United States. 
In some areas of the country, it poses an 
even greater threat than opioids, and it is the 
drug that most contributes to violent crime. 
According to data from the 2017 National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 
over 14.7 million people (5.4 percent of the 
population) have tried methamphetamine at 
least once. 
NSDUH also reports that almost 1.6 million 
people used methamphetamine in the year 
leading up to the survey, and it remains one 
of the most commonly misused stimulant 
drugs in the world. 
According to a report commissioned by the 
CDC in 2018, the age-adjusted rate of drug 
overdose deaths involving methamphetamine 
in the United States more than tripled from 0.6 
per 100,000 population in 2011 to 2.1 in 2016. 
The rate increased on average by an as-
tounding 29 percent per year. 
Jane Carlisle Maxwell from the University of 
Texas found in 2021 that methamphetamine 
still outnumbers other drugs in the four drug 
reporting systems, and it continues to in-
crease, a pattern consistent with that seen in 
other states. 
Over the years, the proportion of meth-
amphetamine items seized has changed. 
In 2005, methamphetamine represented 21 
percent of all items identified by DEA labora-
tories; in 2019, methamphetamine comprised 
50 percent of all the items examined. 
Methamphetamine admissions to treatment 
programs increased from 3 percent of all ad-
missions in 1995 to 11 percent in 2007, 
dropped to 8 percent in 2009, and then rose 
to 22 percent of admissions in 2020. 
The race-ethnic composition has changed in 
terms of Hispanic representation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1158 
February 28, 2022 
In 1995, 91 percent were White, 2 percent 
were Black, and 5 percent were Hispanic. Of 
the 2020 admissions, 90 percent were White, 
7 percent were Black, and 18 percent were 
Hispanic. 
Forty-one percent of the admissions were 
ages 26–35. 
In 1994, 59 percent of the clients were 
male, as compared to 45 percent male in 
2020. 
Based on the results of Maxwell’s previous 
research, females use methamphetamine for 
energy, to lose weight, and to counter depres-
sion. 
There is a significant need to consider gen-
der issues in methamphetamine treatment, 
which could certainly be taken into account by 
the Office of National Drug Control Policy in its 
response plan. 
Additionally, the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy should make treatment for 
methamphetamine addictions the center of its 
response plan. 
The National Institute on Drug Abuse has 
found that the most effective treatments for 
methamphetamine addiction at this point are 
behavioral therapies, such as cognitive-behav-
ioral and contingency management interven-
tions. 
For example, the Matrix Model—a 16-week 
comprehensive behavioral treatment approach 
that combines behavioral therapy, family edu-
cation, individual counseling, 12-step support, 
drug testing, and encouragement for non-drug- 
related activities—has been shown to be ef-
fective in reducing methamphetamine misuse. 
Contingency 
management 
interventions, 
which provide tangible incentives in exchange 
for engaging in treatment and maintaining ab-
stinence from methamphetamines, have also 
been shown to be effective. 
Motivational Incentives for Enhancing Drug 
Abuse Recovery (MIEDAR), an incentive- 
based method for promoting cocaine and 
methamphetamine 
abstinence, 
has 
dem-
onstrated efficacy among methamphetamine 
misusers through NIDA’s National Drug Abuse 
Clinical Trials Network. 
It is, therefore, clear and obvious that treat-
ment should be the center of ONDC’s re-
sponse plan, not incarceration. 
Incarcerating those addicted to drugs has 
clearly not worked considering methamphet-
amine users continue to use throughout our 
country despite the present criminal penalties. 
This bill is of the utmost importance to me 
considering 
the 
major 
threat 
methamphetamines pose in Houston. 
The DEA via Operation Crystal Shield, an 
operation to ramp up enforcement to block the 
further distribution of methamphetamines into 
America’s neighborhoods, has designated the 
city of Houston one of eight major transpor-
tation hubs for methamphetamines. 
The flow of methamphetamines in Houston 
is significant, with major busts by authorities 
not being out of the ordinary. 
Just two weeks ago, Click2Houston reported 
an umpire was arrested after authorities say 
he was in possession of drugs while working 
around children at a youth baseball tour-
nament in the Houston area this week. 
When authorities arrived at the scene, depu-
ties say they found 2.7 grams of crystal meth 
inside the umpire’s vehicle. 
Additionally, in May 2021, authorities seized 
1,789 pounds of methamphetamines in the 
north Houston area, as well as large quantities 
of other narcotics. 
According to authorities, the street value of 
the seizure was approximately $3.4 million. 
The city of Houston is under attack, and the 
belligerent parties are drug traffickers and their 
henchmen. 
They alone are ruining the lives of countless 
Americans, but this bill creates a comprehen-
sive response to ensure that no more lives are 
lost. 
It is for that reason, Mr Speaker, that I am 
urging my colleagues to support the Meth-
amphetamine Response Act of 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 854. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 1543. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 1543, the Suicide Training and 
Awareness Nationally Delivered for 
Universal Prevention Act, also known 
as the STANDUP Act. 
Americans are facing a growing men-
tal health crisis, and that crisis is hit-
ting our Nation’s youth particularly 
hard right now. While the challenges of 
COVID–19 amplified this crisis, chil-
dren and young people in the U.S. have 
been experiencing rising rates of men-
tal health conditions and suicide for 
years, particularly among youth of 
color and LGBTQI+ young people. 
Between 2008 and 2018, the suicide 
rate among adolescents and young peo-
ple increased by nearly 60 percent. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, suicide is the sec-
ond leading cause of death among chil-
dren and young people between the 
ages of 10 and 24. 
Black youth are nearly twice as like-
ly as White youth to die by suicide, and 
the rate of suicide amongst American 
Indian and Alaska Native youth is 21⁄2 
times the overall national average. 
Meanwhile, the suicide rate among 
young Hispanic women increased dra-
matically in the decade leading up to 
the pandemic. 
Additionally, LGBTQI+ youth are at 
greater risk for depression and suicide. 
According to a 2020 survey, 50 percent 
of LGBTQ youth considered attempting 
suicide in the prior year. 
All of these trends are alarming, so 
much so that pediatric experts have de-
clared the state of children’s mental 
health a national emergency. Last De-
cember, 
Surgeon 
General 
Murthy 
issued an advisory on the youth mental 
health crisis. 
Today, the House is continuing its 
critical work of considering legislation 
to address the crisis. The STANDUP 
Act would require State and Tribal 
education agencies to establish and im-
plement a suicide awareness and pre-
vention training policy for middle- and 
high-school students. The policy would 
be required for any agency receiving 
funding through the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration, or SAMHSA’s Project AWARE 
funds, and it would need to be evidence 
based, as well as culturally and linguis-
tically appropriate. 
b 1530 
Last May, Mr. Speaker, we passed 
the House companion of this bill with 
bipartisan support here on the House 
floor after it passed out of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee last Con-
gress. I commend the lead House spon-
sors 
of 
the 
bill, 
Representatives 
PETERS and BILIRAKIS, for their leader-
ship on this issue. 
As chairman of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, I strongly support 
legislation that will help bring aware-
ness and promote best practices on sui-
cide prevention among our Nation’s 
youth. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 1543, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of S. 1543, the 
Suicide Training and Awareness Na-
tionally Delivered for Universal Pre-
vention Act, or STANDUP Act. 
The House version of this bill, H.R. 
586, was led by Representative SCOTT 
PETERS along with Energy and Com-
merce Committee colleagues BILIRAKIS, 
BLUNT ROCHESTER, UPTON, and TONKO. 
It passed this Chamber unanimously 
last May. 
This legislation helps promote sui-
cide awareness and facilitates preven-
tion training for students and young 
Americans. For the last decade, suicide 
has been the second-leading cause of 
death for Americans ages 10 to 24 and 
the 10th leading cause of overall deaths 
in the United States. 
Initiatives that empower students 
with knowledge of the warning signs 
and resources for prevention can help 
in preventing suicide, which this legis-
lation will help to accomplish. 
The pandemic has greatly impacted 
the mental health of Americans across 
the country. It is critical that we con-
tinue addressing these growing chal-
lenges and work to prevent youth sui-
cide 
while 
promoting 
the 
mental 
wellness of all. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support of this bill. It is bipartisan, 
and again, we would be sending it to 
the President with our action today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1543. 
The question was taken; and (two-

rules were suspended and the bill was

tion for the FDA was established by 
Congress in 2007 to advance the mission 
of the FDA and catalyze innovation, 
modernize medical product develop-
ment, and improve safety. 
The NIH and FDA are authorized to 
transfer funding to their respective 
foundations, but that limit has not 
been increased since 2007. 
This bill, S. 1662, would increase the 
transfer authority for both founda-
tions, allowing the foundations to con-
tinue and expand upon the important 
work they have been doing. For exam-
ple, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
they have done important work to en-
hance the FDA and NIH’s work on 
COVID–19 vaccines and diagnostics. 
This bill will help build upon our on-
going efforts to advance biomedical re-
search 
and 
promote 
better 
public 
health outcomes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 1662, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak 
about S. 1662, the Supporting the Foun-
dation for the National Institutes of 
Health and the Reagan-Udall Founda-
tion for the Food and Drug Administra-
tion Act. The companion version of 
this bill, H.R. 3743, was led by Energy 
and Commerce Committee colleagues 
Representatives HUDSON and ESHOO and 
passed the House in December. 
Unleashing biomedical innovation in 
the United States is critical in saving 
lives and maintaining our global com-
petitiveness. We saw how important it 
was to invest in creating new treat-
ments during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
and we need to carry that momentum 
into the future. 
S. 1662 authorizes increased transfer 
authorities from the FDA and NIH to 
the Reagan-Udall Foundation and the 
Foundation for NIH, respectively. Al-
lowing FDA and NIH to transfer addi-
tional resources to these public-private 
partnerships will give the Reagan- 
Udall Foundation and the Foundation 
for the NIH more flexibility to meet 
the growing research demands and ac-
celerate future medical innovations. 
And I close with this: I was in Brus-
sels last week. I am on the NATO Par-
liamentary Assembly. I was with our 
allies as everything took place that we 
all saw in Europe. 
This is the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. We have done some won-
derful work on these bills, and they are 
important. But I will tell you, as I just 
talked about innovation and world 
leadership, it reminded me of this. We 
were energy independent a couple of 
years ago, and I will tell you, people in 
my part of the country, and I am sure 
all over the country, are struggling 
with what they are paying for gas. But 
I will tell you this: I was with our Eu-
ropean allies, and they are terrified 
about what this is going to do to the 
oil markets. 
What we are doing now is just not 
sanctioning the Russian oil because we 
are all terrified of that. So hopefully, 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
will have the opportunity to look at 
the policies, why we are no longer en-
ergy independent and how we can move 
forward. 
I saw the President’s Press Sec-
retary, Ms. Psaki, talking on an inter-
view show yesterday. They asked her 
was the President going to do some-
thing to relieve fossil fuels, and her an-
swer was, well, this just shows why we 
shouldn’t be dependent on fossil fuels. 
Well, the answer is this is why we 
shouldn’t be dependent on foreign fossil 
fuels when we have them available to 
ourselves. Of course, the interviewer 
didn’t ask the following question: Well, 
maybe that is the case, but what are 
we going to do in the next weeks, 
months, and through the summertime? 
We all know, because we see it on the 
television, that it is a dire situation. 
But when you look them in the eyes 
and you see it in their faces—the 
Ukrainians were eligible to come to 
this 
meeting, 
but 
obviously, 
they 
weren’t there. We did have Zoom meet-
ings with them. But we looked at our 
European allies, and it is a tough situa-
tion. 
We can make it better. We can make 
it better for ourselves. We can make it 
better for them. I think it is the right 
thing to do. 
So, hopefully, we will have the oppor-
tunity to move forward. But the bills 
that we are talking about today in my 
subcommittee are important, and I rec-
ommend this bill be passed, as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, again, 
there is bipartisan support for this bill, 
which I also believe would be going to 
the President, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of S. 1662, Supporting the Foundation 
for the National Institutes of Health and the 
Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and 
Drug Administration Act, to increase funding 
for the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food 
and Drug Administration and for the Founda-
tion for the National Institutes of Health. 
The Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food 
and Drug Administration is an independent 
501(c)(3) organization created by Congress 
‘‘to advance the mission of the FDA to mod-
ernize medical, veterinary, food, food ingre-
dient, and cosmetic product development, ac-
celerate innovation, and enhance product 
safety.’’ 
The Foundation embodies FDA’s vision of 
collaborative innovation to address regulatory 
science challenges of the 21st century and as-
sist in the creation of new, applied scientific 
knowledge, tools, standards, and approaches 
the FDA needs to evaluate products more ef-
fectively, predictably, and efficiently, and 
thereby enhance the FDA’s ability to protect 
and promote the health of the American pub-
lic. 
The Foundation serves as a crucial conduit 
between FDA and the public, providing a 
means for FDA to interact directly with stake-
holders, including industry and consumers. 
The Foundation for the National Institutes of 
Health (FNIH) has created hundreds of cross- 
discipline consortia and partnerships whose 
initiatives have generated new ideas, over-
come obstacles and achieved groundbreaking 
biomedical research results. 
The FNIH has created an environment 
where trust and the exchange of new ideas 
can thrive, resulting in scientific innovations. 
The FNIH and its partners have successfully 
generated and implemented new research 
models that are lowering the cost and accel-
erating the progress of biomedical research 
nationwide and across the globe. 
Article I, section 8 of the Constitution grants 
Members of Congress the powers and the au-
thority to ‘‘promote Science and useful Arts.’’ 
As Members of Congress, it is our duty to 
award funding to these institutions, so they 
may continue their groundbreaking work in 
their respective fields. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legisla-
tion and urge all Members to vote for the S. 
1662, Supporting the Foundation for the Na-
tional Institutes of Health and the Reagan- 
Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1662. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1161 
February 28, 2022 
(1) Throughout United States history, soci-
ety has used (in conjunction with skin color) 
hair texture and hairstyle to classify individ-
uals on the basis of race. 
(2) Like one’s skin color, one’s hair has 
served as a basis of race and national origin 
discrimination. 
(3) Racial and national origin discrimina-
tion can and do occur because of long-
standing racial and national origin biases 
and stereotypes associated with hair texture 
and style. 
(4) For example, routinely, people of Afri-
can descent are deprived of educational and 
employment opportunities because they are 
adorned with natural or protective hair-
styles in which hair is tightly coiled or 
tightly curled, or worn in locs, cornrows, 
twists, braids, Bantu knots, or Afros. 
(5) Racial and national origin discrimina-
tion is reflected in school and workplace 
policies and practices that bar natural or 
protective hairstyles commonly worn by peo-
ple of African descent. 
(6) For example, as recently as 2018, the 
U.S. Armed Forces had grooming policies 
that barred natural or protective hairstyles 
that servicemembers of African descent com-
monly wear and that described these hair-
styles as ‘‘unkempt’’. 
(7) The U.S. Army also recognized that pro-
hibitions against natural or protective hair-
styles that African-American soldiers are 
commonly adorned with are racially dis-
criminatory, harmful, and bear no relation-
ship to African-American servicewomen’s oc-
cupational qualifications and their ability to 
serve and protect the Nation. As of February 
2021, the U.S. Army removed minimum hair 
length requirements and lifted restrictions 
on any soldier wearing braids, twists, locs, 
and cornrows in order to promote inclusivity 
and accommodate the hair needs of soldiers. 
(8) As a type of racial or national origin 
discrimination, discrimination on the basis 
of natural or protective hairstyles that peo-
ple of African descent are commonly adorned 
with violates existing Federal law, including 
provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), section 1977 of the Re-
vised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981), and the Fair 
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.). However, 
some Federal courts have misinterpreted 
Federal civil rights law by narrowly inter-
preting the meaning of race or national ori-
gin, and thereby permitting, for example, 
employers to discriminate against people of 
African descent who wear natural or protec-
tive hairstyles even though the employment 
policies involved are not related to workers’ 
ability to perform their jobs. 
(9) Applying this narrow interpretation of 
race or national origin has resulted in a lack 
of Federal civil rights protection for individ-
uals who are discriminated against on the 
basis of characteristics that are commonly 
associated with race and national origin. 
(10) In 2019 and 2020, State legislatures and 
municipal bodies throughout the U.S. have 
introduced and passed legislation that re-
jects certain Federal courts’ restrictive in-
terpretation of race and national origin, and 
expressly classifies race and national origin 
discrimination as inclusive of discrimination 
on the basis of natural or protective hair-
styles commonly associated with race and 
national origin. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Federal Government should ac-
knowledge that individuals who have hair 
texture or wear a hairstyle that is histori-
cally and contemporarily associated with Af-
rican Americans or persons of African de-
scent systematically suffer harmful dis-
crimination in schools, workplaces, and 
other contexts based upon longstanding race 
and national origin stereotypes and biases; 
(2) a clear and comprehensive law should 
address the systematic deprivation of edu-
cational, employment, and other opportuni-
ties on the basis of hair texture and hair-
style that are commonly associated with 
race or national origin; 
(3) clear, consistent, and enforceable legal 
standards must be provided to redress the 
widespread incidences of race and national 
origin discrimination based upon hair tex-
ture and hairstyle in schools, workplaces, 
housing, federally funded institutions, and 
other contexts; 
(4) it is necessary to prevent educational, 
employment, and other decisions, practices, 
and policies generated by or reflecting nega-
tive biases and stereotypes related to race or 
national origin; 
(5) the Federal Government must play a 
key role in enforcing Federal civil rights 
laws in a way that secures equal educational, 
employment, and other opportunities for all 
individuals regardless of their race or na-
tional origin; 
(6) the Federal Government must play a 
central role in enforcing the standards estab-
lished under this Act on behalf of individuals 
who suffer race or national origin discrimi-
nation based upon hair texture and hair-
style; 
(7) it is necessary to prohibit and provide 
remedies for the harms suffered as a result of 
race or national origin discrimination on the 
basis of hair texture and hairstyle; and 
(8) it is necessary to mandate that school, 
workplace, and other applicable standards be 
applied in a nondiscriminatory manner and 
to explicitly prohibit the adoption or imple-
mentation of grooming requirements that 
disproportionately impact people of African 
descent. 
(c) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to 
institute definitions of race and national ori-
gin for Federal civil rights laws that effec-
tuate the comprehensive scope of protection 
Congress intended to be afforded by such 
laws and Congress’ objective to eliminate 
race and national origin discrimination in 
the United States.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to 
limit definitions of race or national origin 
under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
2000a et seq.), the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 
3601 et seq.), or section 1977 of the Revised 
Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981). 
SEC. 9. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Creating a Respect-
ful and Open World for Natural Hair 
Act, or the CROWN Act, is a critically 
important civil rights bill that would 
explicitly prohibit discrimination on 
the basis of hair texture or hairstyles 
commonly associated with a particular 
race or national origin. It would do so 
in areas of the law where discrimina-
tion on the basis of race and national 
origin are already prohibited, such as 
employment, education, and housing. 
To be clear, it is my view that exist-
ing civil rights statutes already make 
such hair-based discrimination unlaw-
ful. The Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity 
Commission 
agrees, 
having 
issued guidance interpreting title VII 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to pro-
hibit such discrimination as a form of 
race discrimination in certain cir-
cumstances. Unfortunately, some Fed-
eral courts have erroneously rejected 
this interpretation. The CROWN Act 
simply fixes these courts’ misinter-
pretation of Federal civil rights law. 
This fix is urgently needed. Accord-
ing to a 2019 study conducted by the 
JOY Collective, Black people are ‘‘dis-
proportionately burdened by policies 
and practices in public places, includ-
ing the workplace, that target, profile, 
or single them out for natural hair 
styles’’ and other hairstyles tradition-
ally associated with their race, like 
braids, locs, and twists. 
The study also found that 80 percent 
of Black women believed that they had 
to change their hair from its natural 
state to fit in at the office and that 
they were 83 percent more likely to be 
judged harshly because of their looks. 
While this study illustrates the prev-
alence of hair discrimination, it is the 
people behind those numbers that 
make this legislation so vital. For ex-
ample, a Texas student was told that 
he would not be able to walk at gradua-
tion because his dreadlocks were too 
long; a Florida boy was turned away 
from his first day of school because his 
hair was too long; and a New Orleans- 
area girl was sent home from school for 
wearing braids. 
Similarly, numerous Black employ-
ees have been told to change their hair 
because it violated their employer’s 
dress code. Some have even been denied 
employment 
altogether 
because 
of 
their hairstyles. 
In view of these disturbing facts, 14 
States have enacted statutes prohib-
iting discrimination on the basis of an 
individual’s natural hairstyle—in every 
case with bipartisan support and some-
times even with the unanimous support 
of both parties. 
While I applaud these States for tak-
ing action, this is a matter of basic jus-
tice that demands a national solution 
by Congress. That is why I strongly 
support the CROWN Act. The House 
passed a nearly identical measure last 
Congress, and I hope that we will do so 
again today. 
I thank the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey, Representative BONNIE WATSON 
COLEMAN, for her leadership and for in-
troducing this important bill this Con-
gress. I urge all Members to support 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, racial discrimination is 
wrong; it is un-American; and it is con-
trary to our ideals. Our Federal civil 
rights laws recognize these facts. The 
laws are clear, and courts have been 
consistent that disparate treatment of 
one individual when compared to an-
other cannot be based on race, color, or 
national origin. 
A person also cannot use a pretextual 
reason as cover for taking a discrimi-
natory action prohibited by our civil 
rights laws. The Supreme Court settled 
that issue in 1973. As early as 1976, Fed-
eral courts held that discrimination on 
the basis of a hairstyle associated with 
a certain race or national origin may, 
in fact, constitute racial discrimina-
tion. 
In other words, under current law, if 
a person’s hairstyle or hair texture is 
associated with a person’s race or na-
tional origin and is used as a pretext 
for discrimination, that conduct is un-
lawful. 
These decades of precedent make the 
bill that we are debating today unnec-
essary and duplicative. In fact, the 
chairman of the committee just said 
that 3 minutes ago. 
The problem raised by the Democrats 
is one solved by enforcing our existing 
laws, not by making this conduct ille-
gal for a second time. 
The Democrats may have recognized 
this fact if they had held legislative 
hearings on this bill this Congress, but 
they didn’t. So, the Committee on the 
Judiciary didn’t have the opportunity 
to hear from experts about the legisla-
tion or how it comports with existing 
law. That is just one example of the de-
ficient process that brought this bill to 
the floor today. 
At markup, Republican members of 
the Committee on the Judiciary raised 
multiple concerns about this bill’s po-
tential impact. For example, schools, 
employers, and other entities covered 
by Federal civil rights laws may have 
race-neutral policies that everyone 
must follow. These policies are some-
times necessary to ensure an employee 
can adequately and safely do their job, 
such as a prohibition on hairstyles that 
could prevent a firefighter from prop-
erly wearing a respirator or a helmet. 
This bill, however, may jeopardize 
these policies because it creates a blan-
ket prohibition on adverse treatment 
because of certain hairstyles or hair 
textures. 
These concerns and the Democrats’ 
deficient process caused every Repub-
lican Member to oppose this bill at 
markup. Instead of working to address 
these problems, the Democrats are 
bringing this bill, which was reported 
on a party-line vote, to a vote under 
suspension of the rules. The Democrats 
are prioritizing this legislation, a bill 
to prohibit conduct already unlawful 
under our law, for political messaging 
reasons. 
This bill does not address any of the 
serious problems our country currently 
faces. Think about the crime problem; 
the 40-year-high inflation problem; the 
2 million illegal immigrants that have 
come across our border in 1 year’s time 
alone; and, of course, not to mention 
the situation going on in Ukraine as we 
speak. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-
pose this bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN), spon-
sor of this bill. 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairman of our 
committee for allotting me this time 
to speak on a bill that I think is very 
important. 
Mr. Speaker, I do rise today to defend 
the right of Black people to exist as 
their authentic selves. 
Mr. Speaker, 58 years after the pas-
sage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ra-
cial discrimination still runs rampant.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1163 
February 28, 2022 
Far too often, Black people, especially 
Black women and girls, are derided or 
deemed unprofessional simply because 
their hair does not conform to White 
beauty standards. 
Our natural hair is as innate a qual-
ity of Black people as the presence of 
melanin in our skin. Discriminating 
against our hair is no different than 
discriminating against the color of our 
skin. 
Hair discrimination forces Black peo-
ple to choose between employment and 
existing authentically. 
Black women are 80 percent more 
likely to alter their hair to fit in at 
work. It is no different at school, where 
Black students are disproportionately 
suspended for unapproved hairstyles. 
Fortunately, with the support of 
groups like the CROWN Coalition, 
State legislatures across the country 
have 
banned 
hair 
discrimination. 
State-level progress is an important 
step in the right direction, but it is not 
enough. 
Mr. Speaker, I have reintroduced the 
CROWN Act to end hair discrimination 
at the Federal level. My bill would 
eliminate an undue burden that Black 
women face every day. 
The methods Black women use to 
manipulate their hair are not only 
costly and time-consuming but also 
damaging to their hair. Nobody should 
have to sacrifice their time, their 
money, and the health of their hair for 
the sake of complying with racist 
standards of professionalism. 
Further, the CROWN Act is a nec-
essary step toward protecting Black 
beauty and culture. Prohibiting hair 
discrimination is only the beginning. 
Even if this bill becomes law, we have 
a long road ahead toward a truly inclu-
sive society. 
As Members of Congress, we must 
pass legislation that promotes diver-
sity 
over 
discrimination 
and 
inclusivity 
over 
intolerance. 
And 
through our work with other organiza-
tions like the CROWN Coalition and 
the Screen Actors Guild, we can change 
the culture and build an America 
where everyone, from our essential 
service workers to our most beloved 
television stars, can live authentically. 
I thank those groups for doing every-
thing in their power to raise awareness 
of this important but often ignored ra-
cial justice issue. 
The CROWN Act is long-overdue civil 
rights legislation. I hope my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle will support 
it and send it to the President’s desk 
without delay. 
No one should be forced to alter their 
appearance to be accepted. It is time 
that Congress recognizes that, and I 
ask for their support. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), 
a member of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chairman for 
yielding, and I thank, with deep appre-
ciation, Congresswoman BONNIE WAT-
SON COLEMAN. 
I am delighted to be an original co-
sponsor, and I thank the Committee on 
the Judiciary for really standing for 
these issues that are uniquely engaged 
in the Constitution and equality and 
justice but that would get no light of 
day had our chairman and our sub-
committee chairpersons not thought 
that it was valuable and important. 
Mr. Speaker, let me say to my 
friends on the other side of the aisle, I 
am very glad for their recitation of the 
civil rights laws. And they are right: 
They are extremely important in pro-
tecting the civil rights of those who 
have been infringed upon. But they are 
not perfect, and they are not perfect as 
evidenced by the continuous, stark dis-
crimination regarding hairstyles, par-
ticularly 
with 
African-American 
women and others. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just say, I realize 
that this is a tough business. But wear 
hairstyles such as what I wear and note 
the social media calling you monkeys 
over and over again. 
So, it is not just the fact that you 
wear a style that could be called a 
crown; it is the advantage that others 
who want to racially divide—do you 
know who they do it to? Our children. 
It is evident that there is a need for 
the CROWN Act because it prevents 
discrimination on the texture of hair 
or 
hairstyles 
commonly 
associated 
with a particular race or national ori-
gin in areas of the law where discrimi-
nation on the basis of race and na-
tional origin is already prohibited, but 
it is not precise. This law is precise. 
Black people are disproportionately 
burdened by policies and practices in 
public places, including the workplace, 
that target, profile, or single them out. 
But others are engaged as well. The 
CROWN study found that Black wom-
en’s hair is more policed in the work-
place, therefore contributing to a cli-
mate of group control. But I have seen 
cases as a member of the Committee on 
Homeland Security of Black women 
coming back from the Caribbean and 
their hair being searched, or they are 
being targeted as having something in 
that hair. That is insulting and offen-
sive, and it is not constitutional as it 
relates to equal justice under the law. 
The findings also say that 80 percent 
of Black women believe that they had 
to change their hairstyle. But, again, 
the young people who in the midst of 
their competition in the State of 
Texas, boys, girls, were required to, in 
an 
outrageous 
manner, 
cut 
their 
dreadlocks before they could compete. 
How heartbreaking that is. How de-
stroyed those children were. And a 
young man had to go all the way to the 
Federal court because he refused to cut 
his dreadlocks. Why should he? 
Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful that 
the military saw the outrage some 
years ago. In 2014, Secretary Hagel in-
dicated a review of military policy. 
The Marine Corps, in 2015, followed suit 
and issued a regulation to permit loc- 
and-twist hairstyles. 
So it is, in fact, very crucial to know 
that it is Native Americans; it is men; 
it is women. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am very grateful to the chairman for 
the time. I thank him so very much. 
Again, this is an outstanding tennis 
player. This is a young man. These are 
styles that are neat and certainly ac-
ceptable. This is a Native American. 
Again, a Black woman. 
And here is the ultimate insult in my 
State. This young man, before he could 
compete, had to have his dreadlocks 
cut. 
Mr. Speaker, the CROWN Act is im-
perative; it is needed; and I can assure 
you, it will not impact any medical at-
tention that you need because the 
CROWN Act is about hair and hair does 
not impact your medical needs. 
Mr. Speaker, we need the CROWN 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
committee on the Judiciary, Homeland Secu-
rity, and on the Budget, and an original co-
sponsor of this important legislation, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2116, the ‘‘Creating a 
Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair 
Act of 2021’’ (‘‘CROWN Act). 
This necessary legislation explicitly prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of hair texture or 
hairstyles commonly associated with a par-
ticular race or national origin in areas of the 
law where discrimination on the basis of race 
or national origin is already prohibited. 
It has long been my position that discrimina-
tion based on hair texture and hairstyle is a 
form of impermissible race discrimination. 
According to a 2019 report, known as the 
CROWN Study, which was conducted by the 
JOY Collective (CROWN Act Coalition, Dove/ 
Unilever, National Urban League, Color of 
Change), Black people are ‘‘disproportionately 
burdened by policies and practices in public 
places, including the workplace, that target, 
profile, or single them out for their natural hair 
styles—referring to the texture of hair that is 
not permed, dyed, relaxed, or chemically al-
tered. 
The CROWN Study found that Black wom-
en’s hair is ‘‘more policed in the workplace, 
thereby contributing to a climate of group con-
trol in the company culture and perceived pro-
fessional barriers’’ compared to non-Black 
women. 
The study also found that ‘‘Black women are 
more likely to have received formal grooming 
policies in the workplace, and to believe that 
there is a dissonance from her hair and other 
race’s hair’’ and that ‘‘Black women’s hair-
styles were consistently rated lower or ‘less 
ready’ for job performance.’’ 
Among the study’s other findings are that 80 
percent of Black women believed that they 
had to change their hair from its natural state 
to ‘‘fit in at the office,’’ that they were 83 per-
cent more likely to be judged harshly because 
of their looks. 
The study indicated that Black women were 
1.5 times more likely to be sent home from the

workplace because of their hair, and that they 
were 3.4 times more likely to be perceived as 
unprofessional compared to non-African-Amer-
ican women. 
Eight years ago, the United States Army re-
moved a grooming regulation prohibiting 
women servicemembers from wearing their 
hair in dreadlocks, a regulation that had a dis-
proportionately 
adverse 
impact 
on 
Black 
women. 
This decision was the result of a 2014 order 
by then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel to 
review the military’s policies regarding hair-
styles popular with African-American women 
after complaints from members of Congress, 
myself included, that the policies unfairly tar-
geted black women. 
In 2015, the Marine Corps followed suit and 
issued regulations to permit lock and twist 
hairstyles. 
The CROWN Study illustrates the preva-
lence of hair discrimination but numerous sto-
ries across the country put names and faces 
to the people behind those numbers. 
In 2017, a Banana Republic employee was 
told by a manager that she was violating the 
company’s dress code because her box braids 
were too ‘‘urban’’ and ‘‘unkempt.’’ 
A year later, in 2018, Andrew Johnson, a 
New Jersey high school student, was forced 
by a white referee to either have his 
dreadlocks cut or forfeit a wrestling match, 
leading him to have his hair cut in public by 
an athletic trainer immediately before the 
match. 
That same year, an 11-year-old Black girl in 
Louisiana was asked to leave class at a pri-
vate Roman Catholic school near New Orle-
ans because her braided hair extensions vio-
lated the school’s policies. 
The next year, two African-American men in 
Texas alleged being denied employment by 
Six Flags because of their hairstyles—one had 
long braids and the other had dreadlocks. 
And earlier this year, there were news re-
ports of a Texas student who would not be al-
lowed to walk at graduation because his 
dreadlocks were too long. 
The CROWN Act prohibits discrimination in 
federally funded programs and activities based 
on an individual’s hair texture or hairstyle if it 
is commonly associated with a particular race 
or national origin, including ‘‘a hairstyle in 
which hair is tightly coiled or tightly curled, 
locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, 
and Afros.’’ 
The legislation also provides that the prohi-
bition will be enforced as if it was incorporated 
into Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
which prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
race, color, or national origin in federally-fund-
ed programs, and that violations of Section 
3(a) will be treated as if they were violations 
of Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for the pas-
sage of H.R. 2116, the CROWN Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA), a member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman and, of course, the 
sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of, and as a proud sponsor of, the 
CROWN Act. 
For far too long, people with hair-
styles or hair textures associated with 
their race or their nationality have 
faced discrimination. Yes, there are 
laws on the books, but it does not pro-
tect DeAndre Arnold, who was a senior 
at Barbers Hill High School in the 
Houston area. He was told to cut his 
dreadlocks in order to attend prom and 
his graduation ceremony. 
Imagine, you work all those years be-
cause they tell you that you need to 
graduate, and then he is told you have 
to cut your dreadlocks. 
For DeAndre, his hairstyle was im-
portant to him because it was part of 
his Trinidadian culture and about who 
he is. 
This is wrong. It must never ever 
happen again. The way that individuals 
choose to style their hair is a direct 
representation of their culture and of 
who they are. When individuals are 
told to alter, cut, or change their hair-
style, what they are really being told is 
to alter their culture and their being. 
This must end. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor 
this bill. I urge my colleagues here 
today to support it, to vote for it, and 
let’s make this wrong a right. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK), 
the newest Member of Congress. 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to represent 
every person of African descent across 
this country and in Florida’s 20th Con-
gressional District with natural hair. 
I call on my colleagues from the U.S. 
Senate to pass the CROWN Act to pro-
hibit discrimination on the basis of 
hair texture or hairstyle that is com-
monly associated with a particular 
race or national origin. 
Lawsuits initiated by Black workers 
alleging discrimination against their 
natural hair in the workplace have 
filled courthouses for more than 40 
years. This legislation will provide us 
with the freedom to wear our crowns 
without discrimination. 
We must understand that hair dis-
crimination is rooted in systemic rac-
ism. Anti-Black hair sentiment on U.S. 
soil has existed for centuries. 
As Members of Congress, we have a 
legal and ethical obligation to push 
back against the Eurocentric beauty 
perpetuated across TV and in the 
media. 
Hair discrimination is race discrimi-
nation. Unfortunately, some employers 
discriminate against people of African 
descent who wear natural hair even 
though the employment policies in-
volved are not related to workers’ abil-
ity to perform the job. 
The notion that some of these poli-
cies are race-neutral policies and, 
therefore, not covered under the 1964 
Civil Rights Act, which outlaws dis-
crimination based on race, sex, color, 
religion, and national origin, is absurd 
and lacks merit. 
As a mother of African-American 
children, I want our beautiful daugh-
ters and sons in my district to feel 
comfortable in their skin without re-
taliation. Sadly, Black students are 
three to six times more likely to be 
suspended or expelled from school. 
Today, there remain regressive move-
ments that continue to criminalize 
natural Black hairstyles under the aus-
pices of preparing them for the real 
world. 
We must, instead, teach our children 
to embrace their natural beauty and 
understand that their humanity is not 
tied to their hair. 
To the organizations that have con-
sistently advocated for the passage of 
this critical piece of legislation, we 
thank you for your commitment.

consin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-

for her stewardship over this bill. I also 
want to thank AYANNA
PRESSLEY, 
ILHAN OMAR, and so many women who 
rose up to support this, not only this 
session but last session as well. I want 
to 
thank 
State 
representative 
LaKeshia Myers in my State in the 
city of Milwaukee for the ordinances 
and the bills that they have passed, 
which are similar to the CROWN Act. 
Mr. Speaker, just let me say, with 
my short 2 minutes here, that my 
being instilled with low self-esteem 
started before I got to kindergarten, 
and it all revolved around my nappy 
hair and the way it just coiled. Two 
minutes is not long enough to carry 
you on this journey of what it is like to 
have your employers tell you that you 
are making them look bad because of 
the way your hair looks, and having 
hot combs, lye, chemicals, and being 
burned so that you can look White. 
When I ran for this office in 2005 be-
cause I had so many pictures with my 
hair coifed in a European style, my 
handlers wouldn’t let me change it. 
After 20 hours a day of campaigning 
every day, I had to figure out how to 
straighten my hair out. Thank God for 
the CROWN Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank God for being 
able to stand here under the e pluribus 
unum as my authentic, nappy-headed 
self.

isiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, my great home State of Lou-
isiana is where the tignon laws origi-
nated. These laws mandated that Black 
women of Louisiana cover their beau-
tiful hair, making it illegal to expose 
our hair. Imagine that. 
All Americans should have the right 
to wear their hair that naturally grows

out of their heads without fear. We, as 
Members of Congress, must act to ban 
any discrimination against natural 
hair. Whether it is locs, curls, braids, 
or twists, Black Americans have the 
right to exist as their authentic selves 
and wear their natural hair with pride. 
The CROWN Act would give and de-
fend the right by prohibiting discrimi-
nation on the basis of hair texture or 
hairstyle in employment, education, 
and several other important spheres. 
This legislation has been heavily vet-
ted and has already been passed in sev-
eral States. 
I am proud to have authored in ad-
vance the CROWN Act as a member of 
the Louisiana State Senate, but not 
complete the process before I was 
elected to Congress. This is particu-
larly special for me. For the people of 
Louisiana and for people across the Na-
tion, Federal action is needed. 
Studies show that 80 percent of Black 
women feel they have to change their 
hairstyles to simply fit in to the work-
place, that natural hair is somehow un-
professional. This is unacceptable. 
I am calling on this Chamber to do 
the right thing, that all elected offi-
cials stand up and do what is right by 
the people of America. This includes 
those who may not live in your district 
and those who have different life expe-
riences. 
For the overwhelming majority of 
our country’s existence, racial dis-
crimination in its various forms has 
been legal. Today, we can continue to 
move this Nation forward. 
Today, the House will vote to make 
discrimination based on hairstyles a 
thing of the past and make our work-
places more inclusive and truly free for 
people to express themselves. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, what is Congress 
doing today? What is the people’s 
House—under the Democrat majority— 
what is the House of Representatives 
up to today? Passing a bill to prohibit 
conduct that is already unlawful under 
the law. Discrimination based on hair-
style is already unlawful. 
That is what the Congress, what the 
House of Representatives, is going to 
pass today. Think about it. That is the 
priority today when we have gone in 
literally 1 year’s time from a secure 
border to complete chaos. Two million 
illegal crossings in 1 year on our bor-
der. In fact, we don’t really have a bor-
der. 
We have gone from safe streets to 
record crime in every major urban area 
in 1 year’s time. They are focused on a 
bill to make conduct that is already 
unlawful, unlawful again, I guess. 
We went from energy independence 
to the spectacle of the President of the 
United States begging OPEC to in-
crease production. We have gone from 
stable prices to a 40-year high inflation 
rate, and Democrats are focused on 
this bill. 
This past summer we had the debacle 
that was the exit from Afghanistan. As 
we speak, the Ukrainian people are 
fighting for their lives, and Democrats 
are passing a bill to prohibit conduct 
already unlawful under Federal law, a 
bill that says you can’t discriminate 
based on hairstyle, which is already 
unlawful. 
We have had a year now where Demo-
crats attack every liberty we enjoy 
under the First Amendment, every sin-
gle one. There are still some locations 
in America where a full congregation 
cannot meet on a Sunday morning. 
There are some places where you still 
can’t assemble and can’t petition. 
The Democrats have kept the Capitol 
closed to the American people, their 
own darn Capitol. How are you sup-
posed to come in and petition your 
Member to redress your grievances if 
you are not even allowed in your Cap-
itol that your tax dollars pay for? Of 
course, we know what they have done 
to freedom of speech and the attacks 
there. Their focus today is on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Let’s focus on the issues that I think 
the vast majority of the American peo-
ple want us to focus on like crime, like 
the 40-year high inflation rate, like the 
border problem, and like the fact that 
we were an energy independent country 
just a few months back. Let’s focus on 
those issues. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, while racism and 
discrimination sometimes appear in 
overt forms, they can also manifest 
themselves in more subtle ways. One 
way is through discrimination based on 
natural hairstyles and hair textures as-
sociated with people of a particular 
race or national origin. 
As we have discussed on this floor, 
this is intolerable and it is not taken 
care of by current law, despite the 
statements from the other side not-
withstanding. The CROWN Act would 
make explicit that the civil rights laws 
prohibit such discrimination. It is a 
matter of basic fairness and justice. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support this important legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 2116, the Cre-
ating a Respectful and Open World for Natural 
Hair Act, commonly known as the CROWN 
Act. I am honored to co-lead this bill with Rep. 
WATSON
COLEMAN, Rep. PRESSLEY, Rep. 
OMAR and Rep. MOORE, which will take direct 
aim at prohibiting race-based hair discrimina-
tion for African Americans and people of Afri-
can descent. 
Hair discrimination creates illogical barriers 
to advancement in the workplace or equal 
treatment in schools for people of African de-
scent. For example, our sons and daughters 
are penalized in school for natural hair styles 
deemed as ‘‘messy’’ and ‘‘unruly.’’ We’ve seen 
students humiliated and unfairly disciplined be-
cause their braided hair extensions or locs 
have been judged as a violation of the dress 
code. In the workplace, a study found that 
women with curly afros, braids or twists, are 
often perceived as ‘‘less professional’’ than 
Black women with straightened hair. These 
perceptions have real impacts on their ability 
to be promoted or get raises. 
I have been fighting to end this discrimina-
tory practice for years. In 2014, the women of 
the Congressional Black Caucus urged the 
Army to rescind Army regulation 670–1, which 
prohibited many hairstyles worn by African 
American women and other women of color 
and I led an amendment included in the FY15 
Defense Appropriations Bill to ban funding for 
this discriminatory rule. Due to our advocacy, 
a few years later the U.S. Navy removed their 
discriminatory policy allowing women, particu-
larly women of color, to wear their hair in 
dreadlocks, large buns, braids, and ponytails. 
This laid the groundwork for California to 
become the first state to ban discrimination 
against African Americans for wearing natural 
hairstyles at school or in the workplace with 
the passage of The Creating a Respectful and 
Open Workplace for Natural hair (CROWN) 
Act. We should be able to show up as our 
whole selves—and passing the CROWN Act is 
a major step in that direction. 
We owe it to our children to take action here 
in Congress to break down these barriers, and 
make sure that they are able to build the fu-
ture they deserve. I urge my colleagues to 
vote yes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, Homeland Security, and on the Budget, 
and an original cosponsor of this important 
legislation, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
2116, the ‘‘Creating a Respectful and Open 
World for Natural Hair Act of 2021’’ (‘‘CROWN 
Act). 
This necessary legislation explicitly prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of hair texture or 
hairstyles commonly associated with a par-
ticular race or national origin in areas of the 
law where discrimination on the basis of race 
or national origin is already prohibited. 
It has long been my position that discrimina-
tion based on hair texture and hairstyle is a 
form of impermissible race discrimination. 
According to a 2019 report, known as the 
CROWN Study, which was conducted by the 
JOY Collective (CROWN Act Coalition, Dove/ 
Unilever, National Urban League, Color of 
Change), Black people are ‘‘disproportionately 
burdened by policies and practices in public 
places, including the workplace, that target, 
profile, or single them out for their natural hair 
styles—referring to the texture of hair that is 
not permed, dyed, relaxed, or chemically al-
tered.’’ 
The CROWN Study found that Black wom-
en’s hair is ‘‘more policed in the workplace, 
thereby contributing to a climate of group con-
trol in the company culture and perceived pro-
fessional barriers’’ compared to non-Black 
women. 
The study also found that ‘‘Black women are 
more likely to have received formal grooming 
policies in the workplace, and to believe that 
there is a dissonance from her hair and other

race’s hair’’ and that ‘‘Black women’s hair-
styles were consistently rated lower or ‘less 
ready’ for job performance.’’ 
Among the study’s other findings are that 80 
percent of Black women believed that they 
had to change their hair from its natural state 
to ‘‘fit in at the office,’’ that they were 83 per-
cent more likely to be judged harshly because 
of their looks. 
The study indicated that Black women were 
1.5 times more likely to be sent home from the 
workplace because of their hair, and that they 
were 3.4 times more likely to be perceived as 
unprofessional compared to non-African-Amer-
ican women. 
Eight years ago, the United States Army re-
moved a grooming regulation prohibiting 
women servicemembers from wearing their 
hair in dreadlocks, a regulation that had a dis-
proportionately 
adverse 
impact 
on 
Black 
women. 
This decision was the result of a 2014 order 
by then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel to 
review the military’s policies regarding hair-
styles popular with African-American women 
after complaints from members of Congress, 
myself included, that the policies unfairly tar-
geted black women. 
In 2015, the Marine Corps followed suit and 
issued regulations to permit lock and twist 
hairstyles. 
The CROWN Study illustrates the preva-
lence of hair discrimination but numerous sto-
ries across the country put names and faces 
to the people behind those numbers. 
In 2017, a Banana Republic employee was 
told by a manager that she was violating the 
company’s dress code because her box braids 
were too ‘‘urban’’ and ‘‘unkempt.’’ 
A year later, in 2018, Andrew Johnson, a 
New Jersey high school student, was forced 
by a white referee to either have his 
dreadlocks cut or forfeit a wrestling match, 
leading him to have his hair cut in public by 
an athletic trainer immediately before the 
match. 
That same year, an 11-year-old Black girl in 
Louisiana was asked to leave class at a pri-
vate Roman Catholic school near New Orle-
ans because her braided hair extensions vio-
lated the school’s policies. 
The next year, two African-American men in 
Texas alleged being denied employment by 
Six Flags because of their hairstyles—one had 
long braids and the other had dreadlocks. 
And earlier this year, there were news re-
ports of a Texas student who would not be al-
lowed to walk at graduation because his 
dreadlocks were too long. 
The CROWN Act prohibits discrimination in 
federally funded programs and activities based 
on an individual’s hair texture or hairstyle if it 
is commonly associated with a particular race 
or national origin, including ‘‘a hairstyle in 
which hair is tightly coiled or tightly curled, 
locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, 
and Afros.’’ 
The legislation also provides that the prohi-
bition will be enforced as if it was incorporated 
into Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
which prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
race, color, or national origin in federally-fund-
ed programs, and that violations of Section 
3(a) will be treated as if they were violations 
of Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for the pas-
sage of H.R. 2116, the CROWN Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
WATSON COLEMAN). The question is on 
the motion offered by the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. NADLER) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 2116, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, on

title 18, United States Code, to specify 
lynching as a hate crime act, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 55 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act is long-overdue legis-
lation that would correct a historical 
injustice by finally specifying lynching 
as a crime under Federal law. 
Our Nation endured a shameful pe-
riod during which thousands of African 
Americans were lynched as a means of 
racial 
subordination 
and 
enforcing 
white supremacy. These violent inci-
dents were largely tolerated by State 
and Federal officials, and they rep-
resent a stain on our Nation’s legacy. 
Today, we acknowledge this disgrace-
ful chapter in American history, and 
we send a clear message that such vio-
lent actions motivated by hatred and 
bigotry will not be tolerated in this 
country. 
The term ‘‘lynching’’ generally refers 
to premeditated public acts of vio-
lence—often resulting in death—car-
ried out by a mob in order to punish an 
alleged transgressor or to strike fear 
among a targeted group. 
Throughout history, lynching has 
been employed as an extreme form of 
informal group social control and has 
often been conducted with the display 
of a public spectacle for maximum in-
timidation. 
This legislation is named in honor of 
Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African- 
American youth from Chicago, who 
was lynched in a particularly gruesome 
fashion while visiting an uncle in Mis-
sissippi in 1955. His murder and the 
antilynching movement that followed 
set the stage for the creation of the 
civil rights movement that we recog-
nize today. 
Though lynching touches all races 
and religions and occurs throughout 
the United States, it has been most 
common in the South and was targeted 
primarily at Blacks. 
During the period between the Civil 
War and World War II, thousands of Af-
rican Americans were lynched in the 
United States. These violent incidents 
profoundly impacted race relations and 
shaped the geographic, political, social, 
and economic conditions of African- 
American communities in ways that 
are still evident today. 
The first Federal antilynching legis-
lation was introduced in 1900, almost 
120 years ago, by Congressman George 
Henry White, the only African-Amer-
ican Member of Congress at that time. 
Unfortunately, neither his bill nor any 
antilynching bills that were introduced 
in the decades that followed managed 
to pass Congress. 
The Department of Justice has used 
other laws to prosecute some civil 
rights-era crimes and hate crimes that 
were described as lynching in public

discourse, but there is no Federal law 
explicitly prohibiting lynching. 
Today, we act to correct this histor-
ical injustice. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RUSH) 
for his leadership on this important 
issue and for his attention to history. 
In memory of Emmett Till and in 
memory of all the victims of lynching 
throughout our history, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the bill before us 
today recalls a dark period in our Na-
tion’s history. Lynching is an espe-
cially horrible act of violence. It was 
and is as wrong as wrong can be. 
Last century, lynchings were a com-
mon atrocity committed by the Ku 
Klux Klan against the Black commu-
nity. From the 1880s to the 1960s, ap-
proximately 
4,743 
individuals 
were 
lynched in the United States, of whom 
3,400 victims were African American. 
The bill before us today will make 
lynching a hate crime under the Fed-
eral code. There should be no doubt 
that our Nation condemns lynching in 
the strongest possible terms, which is 
why I was surprised that the bill re-
ported out of committee minimized the 
importance of the gravity of the crime 
of lynching. I am pleased, however, 
that the majority is bringing this 
version to the floor rather than the 
text reported out of committee. 
The bill reported out of committee 
simply criminalized conspiracies to 
commit any type of hate crime no mat-
ter how insignificant the injury. The 
bill before us today criminalizes a con-
spiracy if death or serious bodily in-
jury occurs. 
Madam Speaker, I hope we can all 
stand with one voice and condemn the 
atrocity of lynching. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1615 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 55, the Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act, which amends title 
18, section 249 of the United States 
Code to make lynching a hate crime 
under Federal law punishable by up to 
30 years imprisonment. 
But before I go any further, let me 
acknowledge Congressman BOBBY RUSH 
who has been steadfast in the years 
that I have known him pushing day 
after day because Mamie Till and Em-
mett came from Chicago, from Illinois, 
going down to Mississippi, as Black 
children typically did, to see relatives 
in Mississippi, in Georgia, in Florida, 
in Texas, and in Alabama. He went 
down in 1955. 
I thank Congressman RUSH for his 
leadership and persistence. We tried to 
get this in the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act, but I think we are where 
we want to be, a freestanding bill. 
In 1989 a civil rights memorial was 
dedicated in Montgomery, Alabama, 
the birthplace of the modern civil 
rights movement, one of the efforts of 
Bryan Stevenson, to memorialize these 
individuals who were hanged. It honors 
the lives and memories of 40 martyrs 
who were slain during the movement 
from 1954 to 1968, including Emmett 
Till. We know that many more people 
lost their lives to racial violence dur-
ing that era. As we were studying H.R. 
40, the Reparations Commission, we de-
termined 4,000—and most of those who 
were lynched were African Americans— 
the killers of 13 of the 40 martyrs 
whose names were inscribed on the me-
morial had not been prosecuted or con-
victed, and it is dedicated to those 
martyrs. 
In 10 of the 40 deaths, defendants 
were either acquitted by all-White ju-
ries or served only token prison sen-
tences. We also know there are many 
cases that still cry out for justice that 
involve hanging in particular of Afri-
can Americans. These unsolved crimes 
represent a continuing stain on our Na-
tion’s honor and mock its commitment 
to equal justice under the law. The leg-
islation before us is intended to help 
remove that stain once and for all. 
The 40 victims selected for inclusion 
in the civil rights memorial fit at least 
one of three criteria: they were mur-
dered because they were active in the 
civil 
rights 
movement; 
they 
were 
killed by organized hate crimes as acts 
of terror aimed at intimidating Black 
and civil rights activists; and their 
death, like the death of Emmett Till, 
helped to galvanize a movement by 
demonstrating the brutality faced by 
African Americans in the South. 
That young boy aged 13 was hanged. 
These individuals were hanged. Several 
were White; 33 were Black. They were 
students, 
farmers, 
ministers, 
truck 
drivers, a homemaker, and a Nobel lau-
reate. But, Madam Speaker, there are 
many, many other victims besides the 
40 who were remembered in the memo-
rial. The Southern Poverty Law Center 
reports through its research that ap-
proximately 75 other people died vio-
lently between 1952 and 1968 under cir-
cumstances suggesting that they were 
victims of racial violence. For most of 
them, the reason their names were not 
added to the memorial is because they 
were not enough; because the killings 
of African Americans were often cov-
ered up or not seriously investigated. 
There is little to doubt that many 
slayings were never recorded by au-
thorities. 
The crux of the matter is that lynch-
ing, even up to today, 2022, was not a 
Federal crime, and the heinous and evil 
act of lynching another human being 
was not a Federal crime that could be 
prosecuted. These are the ways that we 
can address this question by a Federal 
antilynching bill once and for all, mak-
ing it a crime to lynch anyone in the 
United States. 
So let me thank Mamie Till for being 
a courageous and wonderful civil rights 
activist driven by the heinous and hor-
rible killing and hanging of a 13-year- 
old boy. 
This is both mother and son in a 
much nicer time, and this is a mother 
who is expressing pain at the funeral of 
her child. And this, of course, is a pho-
tograph of what a 13-year-old, hand-
some, little boy looked like after he 
was beaten, lynched, dragged, and 
thrown in the water. This has to stop. 
Now with this legislation we will fi-
nally have an antilynching legislation 
that makes illegal the idea of lynching. 
Let me say that this idea of lynching 
is not an old act. 1981 was one of the 
most recent acts of lynching a fellow 
human being. So it is extremely impor-
tant that we have this law that once 
and forever says that if it is not in the 
Constitution in terms of the exact lan-
guage, it is tied to the Constitution, 
the 13th Amendment, which is the pro-
hibition of slavery, the 14th Amend-
ment which is due process. And I can 
assure our colleagues that we have not 
completed the thoughts of both of 
those amendments without having H.R. 
55 which helps to ensure that justice is 
rendered and that lynching forever is 
stopped and that we realize that it is 
both a devastating and deadly act. But 
it is the ultimate indignity of taking 
another human being and hanging 
them like a piece of whatever one 
would like to imagine, like meat in a 
meat locker. 
Let us stop that now. Let America 
stand as a place of human rights and a 
place of dignity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support H.R. 55. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding 
time to me. I am grateful that we are 
going to be voting today on this 
version of this bill. I think it is a 
much-improved version as opposed to 
the one that came out of committee. I 
am grateful to all those who worked 
hard on this to try to make this a bet-
ter bill, and I am grateful for that. 
I think when we reflect upon this bill 
and the history of our Nation—this Na-
tion we all love and cherish—we recog-
nize that we have to cure and acknowl-
edge some issues and problems that we 
have had. And this is not the least of 
those for sure, but it is an important 
thing to recognize. 
I appreciated the chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee mentioning George 
Henry White who was the first person 
to introduce an antilynching piece of 
legislation. George Henry White was 
from North Carolina. He was a Repub-
lican Representative. He was the only 
African American who was a Member 
of Congress at the time. After he left 
Congress in the early part of the last 
century, 1901, it would be 28 years be-
fore another African American came

into these important Halls of law and 
legislation. 
One thing that Congressman White 
was very bold about was to fight and 
stand against disenfranchisement, to 
fight disenfranchisement and also to 
fight mob violence which took an in-
credible amount of courage and dis-
cipline, and I appreciate that and his 
history. 
I am hopeful that we will make this 
a unanimous vote. I hope that we will 
record that vote for our posterity and 
for all Americans to know and recog-
nize that the United States House of 
Representatives could come together 
as yet we may disagree on so many 
things, but on this issue that we can 
come together unitedly. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the op-
portunity to speak on this, and I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of the Em-
mett Till Antilynching Act. Sadly, 
more than 6,500 Black Americans were 
lynched between 1865 and 1950. My 
home State of Texas sadly—sadly—has 
the third highest number of lynchings 
in history. There were 468 documented 
deaths by lynching in Texas between 
1885 and 1942. However, many histo-
rians believe that closer to 5,000 Mexi-
cans and Mexican Americans died by 
lynching around this time. 
Few actions are crueler, more hei-
nous, and more inhumane than some-
one being lynched. Yet to this day— 
and shamefully so—lynching does not 
have a Federal hate crime legislation. 
Since 1900 there have been more than 
200 attempts to codify lynching as a 
Federal crime, but each attempt was 
unsuccessful. 
Today we can correct this historical 
injustice. By passing this bill, we can 
begin the closing of this terrible and 
shameful chapter in America’s history. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to co-
sponsor this bill, and I urge all my col-
leagues to support it here today. I am 
pleased to hear the other side of the 
aisle talk about a unanimous vote. 
What we need is a unanimous vote to 
support this bill. It is time. It is time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. CAR-
TER). 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, this bill would, incredibly and 
tragically, for the first time make 
lynching a Federal hate crime in 
America. 
Despite more than 200 attempts to 
pass antilynching legislation through 
Congress over the past 120 years, lynch-
ing has never been designated as a Fed-
eral crime. 
And this isn’t just a horror of the 
past. Unfortunately, we still see these 
horrible instances. This is reality still 
today because murders are prosecuted 
at the local level, this historical injus-
tice meant that 99 percent of lynching 
perpetrators escaped punishment. 
This bill is long overdue. Today I will 
be voting for Representative BOBBY 
RUSH’s antilynching bill to finally 
close this dark chapter of our history. 
We cannot bring back Emmett Till or 
the thousands of others whose precious 
lives were lost in the horrible acts of 
racial 
terror, 
but 
passing 
this 
antilynching act is a historic step for-
ward justice and a signal that our Na-
tion will finally reckon with this dark 
chapter of our history. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time, and I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would just say that I hope we do have 
a unanimous vote and support this 
good piece of legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, with this legisla-
tion, we can right a great historical 
wrong by finally specifying lynching as 
a crime under Federal law, more than 
120 years after the first antilynching 
bill was introduced in Congress. Al-
though this proposal should have been 
law a long time ago, it is never too late 
to do the right thing. 
The shameful era when lynchings 
were commonplace in this country— 
particularly in the South—is thank-
fully over, but we have seen disturbing 
echoes of this gruesome practice in re-
cent years—most recently in the brutal 
murder of Ahmaud Arbery. This legis-
lation sends a clear message that such 
violent actions motivated by hatred 
and bigotry will not be tolerated in 
this country. 
The Nation is in the midst of a na-
tional conversation and a national 
awakening on issues of race and jus-
tice. As we reckon with our past and 
look to the future, it is important that 
we place lynching where it properly be-
longs—in criminal code alongside other 
hate crimes that have caused so much 
pain and suffering over the years. 
I want to thank Congressman BOBBY 
RUSH for his tireless efforts in bringing 
this legislation forward and all the 
other Members whose efforts have 
paved the way for passage of this bill 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 55, the ‘‘Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act,’’ which amends the Title 18, 
Section 249 of the United States Code to 
make lynching a hate crime under federal law 
punishable by up to 30 years imprisonment. 
Madam Speaker, in 1989, the Civil Rights 
Memorial was dedicated in Montgomery, Ala-
bama, the birthplace of the modern Civil 
Rights Movement. 
The Memorial honors the lives and memo-
ries of 40 martyrs who were slain during the 
movement from 1954 to 1968, including Em-
mett Till. 
But we know that many more people lost 
their lives to racial violence during that era. 
In fact, at the time the Memorial was dedi-
cated, the killers of 13 of the 40 martyrs 
whose names are inscribed on the Memorial 
had not been prosecuted or convicted. 
In 10 of the 40 deaths, defendants were ei-
ther acquitted by allwhite juries or served only 
token prison sentences. 
We also know there are many cases that 
still cry out for justice. 
These unsolved crimes represent a con-
tinuing stain on our nation’s honor and mock 
its commitment to equal justice under law. 
The legislation before us is intended to help 
us remove that stain once and for all. 
The 40 victims selected for inclusion in the 
Civil Rights Memorial fit at least one of three 
criteria: (1) they were murdered because they 
were active in the civil rights movement; (2) 
they were killed by organized hate groups as 
acts of terror aimed at intimidating blacks and 
civil rights activists; or, (3) their deaths, like 
the death of Emmett Till, helped to galvanize 
the movement by demonstrating the brutality 
faced by African Americans in the South. 
The 40 persons who fit the selection criteria 
ranged in age from 11 to 66. 
Seven were white, and 33 were black. 
They were students, farmers, ministers, 
truck drivers, a homemaker and a Nobel lau-
reate. 
But Madam Speaker, there are many, many 
other victims besides the 40 who are remem-
bered on the Memorial. 
The Southern Poverty Law Center reports 
that its research uncovered approximately 75 
other people who died violently between 1952 
and 1968 under circumstances suggesting that 
they were victims of racial violence. 
For most of them the reason their names 
were not added to the Memorial is because 
not enough was known about the details sur-
rounding their deaths. 
Sadly, the reason so little is known about 
these cases is because they were not fully in-
vestigated or, in some cases, law enforcement 
officials were involved in the killings or subse-
quent cover-ups. 
And because the killings of African Ameri-
cans were often covered up or not seriously 
investigated, there is little reason to doubt that 
many slayings were never even recorded by 
the authorities. 
The reason justice had not been served was 
the callous indifference, and often the criminal 
collusion, of many white law enforcement offi-
cials in the segregated South. 
There simply was no justice for African 
Americans during the civil rights era. 
The whole criminal justice system—from the 
police to the prosecutors, to the juries, and to 
the judges—was perverted by racial bigotry. 
African Americans were routinely beaten, 
bombed and shot with impunity. 
Sometimes, the killers picked their victims 
on a whim. 
Sometimes, they targeted them for their ac-
tivism. 
In other cases, prominent white citizens 
were involved, and no consequences flowed. 
Herbert Lee of Liberty, Mississippi, for ex-
ample, was shot in the head by a state legis-
lator in broad daylight in 1961. 
It is, of course, fitting and proper that this 
legislation bears the name of Emmett Till, 
whose slaying in 1955 and his mother’s deci-
sion to have an open casket at his funeral 
stirred the nation’s conscience and galvanized 
a generation of Americans to join the fight for 
equality.

Sadly, hundreds of them were killed in that 
struggle, and many of the killers, like those of 
Emmett himself, were never successfully pros-
ecuted. 
Madam Speaker, over the past half century, 
the United States has made tremendous 
progress in overcoming the badges and 
vestiges of slavery. 
But this progress has been purchased at 
great cost. 
Examples of unsolved cases include the 
1968 ‘‘Orangeburg Massacre’’ at South Caro-
lina State University where state police shot 
and killed three student protesters; the 1967 
shooting death of Carrie Brumfield, whose 
body was found on a rural Louisiana road; the 
1957 murder of Willie Joe Sanford, whose 
body 
was 
fished 
out 
of 
a 
creek 
in 
Hawkinsville, Georgia; the 1946 killing of a 
black couple, including a pregnant woman, 
who was pulled out of a car in Monroe, Geor-
gia, and dragged down a wagon trail before 
being shot in front of 200 people. 
Solving cases like these is part of the great 
unfinished work I of America. 
Madam Speaker, 53 years ago, Medgar 
Evers was murdered in Jackson, Mississippi; 
justice would not be done in his case for more 
than twenty years. 
But that day was foretold because the 
evening before the death of Medgar Evers, on 
June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy 
addressed the nation from the Oval Office on 
the state of race relations and civil rights in 
America. 
In his historic speech to the nation President 
Kennedy said: 
‘‘We are confronted primarily with a moral 
issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as 
clear as the American Constitution. 
‘‘One hundred years of delay have passed 
since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet 
their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. 
They are not yet freed from the bonds of injus-
tice. They are not yet freed from social and 
economic oppression. And this Nation, for all 
its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully 
free until all its citizens are free.’’ 
H.R. 55 will help ensure that justice is re-
ceived by victims of lynching and in doing so, 
this legislation will help this Nation fulfill its 
hopes and justify its boast that in America all 
persons live in freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support this leg-
islation and urge all Members to join me in 
voting for its passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 55, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

INDIANA HUNT-MARTIN POST 
OFFICE BUILDING 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2142) to designate the facility 
of the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 170 Manhattan Avenue in Buf-
falo, New York, as the ‘‘Indiana Hunt- 
Martin Post Office Building’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2142 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. INDIANA HUNT-MARTIN POST OFFICE 
BUILDING. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 170 
Manhattan Avenue in Buffalo, New York, 
shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Indi-
ana Hunt-Martin Post Office Building’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Indiana Hunt-Martin 
Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DONALDS) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2142, to designate the facil-
ity of the United States Postal Service 
located at 170 Manhattan Avenue in 
Buffalo, New York, as the Indiana 
Hunt-Martin Post Office Building. 
Mrs. Indiana Hunt-Martin was born 
on May 30, 1922, in Georgia. Her family 
moved to western New York when she 
was in elementary school, and she was 
one of only two Black students in her 
high school class. 
She aspired to a business career but 
faced limited opportunities and had to 
take jobs picking peaches and cleaning 
restrooms at a TNT factory. 
In 1944, Mrs. Hunt-Martin joined the 
newly formed Women’s Army Corps. 
The Women’s Army Corps had more 
than 800 Black female soldiers serving 
in the 6888th Central Postal Directory 
Battalion, known as the Six Triple 
Eight. The Six Triple Eight was the 
only 
all-African-American 
Women’s 
Army Corps. 
Mrs. Hunt-Martin was one of the 
original 500 African-American female 
soldiers who were chosen to sail across 
the Atlantic. The soldiers feared they 
would not make it alive because they 
were being chased by a German U-boat. 
Fortunately, they arrived safely in 
Liverpool, England. 
In England, the soldiers were as-
signed to horrific conditions, staying 
in dilapidated schools infested with 
rats and parasites. Regardless of the 
conditions, 
the 
Six 
Triple 
Eight 
cleared a backlog of more than 17 mil-
lion pieces of mail and packages in 
only 3 months. 
They were then relocated to Rouen 
and Paris, France, where they contin-
ued adhering to their motto, ‘‘No mail, 
low morale.’’ 
In February 1946, the Six Triple 
Eight returned to a segregated United 
States. The unit received honorable 
discharges when they were disbanded 
but no recognition of their accomplish-
ments. 
Mrs. Hunt-Martin went on to have a 
distinguished career at the New York 
Department of Labor, working there 
for 41 years and retiring in 1987. 
She met her husband at the New 
York Department of Labor, with whom 
she had a loving daughter, Janice Mar-
tin. 
Throughout the years, Mrs. Hunt- 
Martin was an active life member of 
several 
veterans 
organizations 
and 
mentored 
young 
African-American 
women who chose to serve in the mili-
tary. 
She was inducted into the New York 
State Veterans Hall of Fame and re-
ceived several service medals. 
Mrs. Hunt-Martin passed away peace-
fully on September 21, 2020, at the age 
of 98. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
join me in honoring this American hero 
by naming the post office at 170 Man-
hattan Avenue as the Indiana Hunt- 
Martin Post Office Building. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this bill, which would name a post of-
fice in New York after Indiana Hunt- 
Martin. 
Mrs. 
Hunt-Martin 
was 
born 
in 
Uvalda, Georgia, during a time when 
opportunities 
for 
Black 
Americans 
were very limited. Her family moved to 
western New York, where she was one 
of two Black students at Niagara Falls 
High School. 
In 1944, Mrs. Hunt-Martin joined the 
only 
all-African-American 
Women’s 
Army Corps, the 6888th Central Postal 
Directory Battalion, known as the Six 
Triple Eight. 
She was then chosen to serve over-
seas in England, where she worked 
with fellow soldiers under harsh and 
challenging workspace conditions. 
In only 3 months, they cleared a 2- 
year backlog of mail destined for near-
ly 7 million members of the United 
States military and others serving in 
the European theater. This was cer-
tainly an important contribution to

the war effort, which the Six Triple 
Eight recognized with the motto: ‘‘No 
mail, low morale.’’ 
In 1946, Mrs. Hunt-Martin returned to 
the United States and received an hon-
orable discharge. She then worked at 
the United States Department of Labor 
for 41 years. During this service, she 
met her husband and had a daughter, 
Janice Martin. 
After her service to the Nation, Mrs. 
Hunt-Martin became an active member 
of several veterans organizations and 
mentored young Black women who 
served in the military. 
Sadly, on September 21, 2020, Indiana 
Hunt-Martin passed away. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this bill to honor Indiana Hunt-Mar-
tin’s exemplary life of service. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. HIGGINS), the author of 
this important bill. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
2142, legislation designating the Cen-
tral Park Post Office in Buffalo, New 
York, as the Indiana Hunt-Martin Post 
Office Building. 
It is fitting that consideration of this 
bill celebrating the life and service of 
an American trailblazer take place 
today during Black History month and 
upon Women’s History Month. 
Born in 1922, Indiana Hunt-Martin 
moved to Niagara Falls as a child and 
graduated from Niagara Falls High 
School before joining the Women’s 
Army Corps in 1944. 
Following enlistment, she traveled 
by railroad to Fort Oglethorpe in Geor-
gia, where she underwent training. 
She recalled encounters with seg-
regation as she traveled south: a train 
stop in Washington, D.C., where pas-
sengers were separated into railcars 
based on race; separate restrooms and 
drinking fountains; and fellow military 
members getting in trouble for refusing 
to sit in the back of the bus. 
Indiana Hunt-Martin was a member 
of the Six Triple Eight Central Postal 
Directory Battalion within the Wom-
en’s Army Corps, the first Black female 
battalion and the only all-women bat-
talion to be deployed overseas. 
The unit sorted and redirected mil-
lions of backlogged letters and pack-
ages sent to soldiers, working around 
the clock to deliver approximately 
65,000 pieces of mail each shift. 
Indiana Hunt-Martin served this Na-
tion selflessly and was honorably dis-
charged from the United States Army 
on November 10, 1945. 
After the war, she worked for the 
New York State Department of Labor 
for 41 years, retiring in 1987. 
In addition to serving her country, 
she served her community through nu-
merous veterans, church, and neighbor-
hood organizations. 
In 2014, we had the distinct privilege 
of presenting her with the medals she 
earned while serving in the United 
States Army, including the Women’s 
Army Corps Service Medal, the Euro-
pean-African-Middle Eastern Campaign 
Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, 
and the Honorable Service Lapel award 
for her service during World War II. 
The idea for this legislation was 
brought to us by Korean war veteran 
Sandi Williams, who serves as presi-
dent and founder of the United Vet-
erans of Buffalo. 
The bill has the bipartisan support of 
the entire New York congressional del-
egation, the Bennett-Wells American 
Legion Auxiliary Post, the Johnetta R. 
Cole AMVETS Post, the Jesse Clipper 
American Legion Post, and many oth-
ers. 
From 1978 until her passing, Indiana 
Hunt-Martin frequented the post office 
on Manhattan Avenue in Buffalo week-
ly to purchase stamps, pick up mail, 
and send letters. 
There are post offices named for 
Presidents and famous celebrities, but 
I might argue that there would be none 
more fitting than the one paying trib-
ute to the legacy of Indiana Hunt-Mar-
tin and her service to our country. 
I am proud to lead this effort, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me in ap-
proving this legislation. 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, with 
no further speakers, I urge passage of 
H.R. 2142, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2142, to 
honor Ms. Indiana Hunt-Martin, a member of 
the 
Women’s 
Army 
Corps 
(WAC) 
groundbreaking 6888 Central Postal Directory 
Battalion (Six Triple Eight), the only all-black 
WAC battalion deployed overseas during 
WWII. 
As a cosponsor of this bill and the author of 
the House measure to award a Congressional 
Gold Medal to all the women of the Six Triple 
Eight that the Congress will soon enact, Ms. 
Hunt-Martin’s story is the story of most of the 
women who served in the 6888. 
According to her daughter, ‘‘she was born in 
a time and place where share cropping, lynch-
ing, and hatred of people, especially males of 
color were everyday occurrences.’’ 
Yet, she was not deterred from serving her 
country. Born in Georgia, she moved to New 
York in the 1920’s when she was still a young 
child. After graduating high school, she read 
about an effort by First Lady Eleanor Roo-
sevelt and Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, the 
founding president of the National Council of 
Negro Women, to ensure that women of color 
could join the war effort as part of the WAC. 
So she applied. And waited. And after, her 
application was apparently ‘‘lost’’, she did not 
give up. She applied again, was accepted, 
and enlisted. 
She was subsequently chosen to serve in 
the Six Triple Eight. And served honorably 
with that groundbreaking unit. 
After her military service, she worked for the 
New York State Department of Labor, retiring 
after some 40 years of service. In 2014, in a 
story that is very familiar to me, she reached 
out to her local congressman, Mr. HIGGINS, for 
help getting the medals she had earned 
through her service so many decades earlier. 
This story is familiar to me because my own 
constituent, Ms. Anna Mae Robertson, who 
also served with the Six Triple Eight, similarly 
reached out to my office around the same 
time to help her get the service medals she 
had earned. 
This evening, I will have the honor of 
hosting Ms. Hunt-Martin’s daughter in my of-
fice as we celebrate the passage of this bill 
and my Six Triple Eight Gold Medal bill (H.R. 
1012/S. 321). While Ms. Hunt-Martin and the 
vast majority of the women who served with 
the 6888 may no longer be with us, today we 
make sure that their service and sacrifice is 
not forgotten. 
As noted by Debbera Ranson, the com-
mander and founder of the Johnetta R. Coles 
AmVets post in Buffalo, NY, ‘‘There are so 
many times when African American soldiers 
have done wonderful things but it takes for-
ever for them to get recognized. Many times, 
the honors that they eventually received—if 
they even do—is way after they have passed. 
And so, as we do these different honors, at 
least family members will be able to enjoy 
knowing that their loved ones have been hon-
ored.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2142. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
REPRESENTATIVE 
JAMES 
HAGEDORN 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the Minnesota delega-
tion as we honor the life and mourn the 
passing of our colleague, Jim Hagedorn 
of Blue Earth, Minnesota. 
Public service was a defining feature 
in the life of Representative Hagedorn. 
As a young man, he worked here in the 
House for 7 years as a legislative as-
sistant 
with 
Congressman 
Arlan 
Stangeland. He then served as a legis-
lative and congressional affairs officer 
for two U.S. Department of Treasury 
agencies, the Financial Management 
Service and the Bureau of Engraving 
and Printing. 
Since 2019, Congressman Hagedorn 
represented the cities, 
towns, 
and 
farms of southern Minnesota’s First 
Congressional District. 
On the Small Business and Agri-
culture Committees, Jim worked to ex-
pand broadband access to rural commu-
nities, as well as provide additional 
support for farmers and ranchers dur-
ing the pandemic. 
Even as Jim bravely endured the per-
sonal challenge of cancer treatment, he 
did so with dignity and grace. Jim con-
tinued to serve our country and his 
constituents. 
Despite our policy differences on 
many issues, Jim and I were united in 
the common goal of achieving greater 
opportunities for future generations of 
Minnesotans. 
I offer my deepest condolences to 
Jim’s family, his friends, his staff, and 
the people of the First Congressional 
District during this difficult time. 
Minnesota’s 
Congressional 
district 
delegation is grateful for Congressman 
Hagedorn’s service to our country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER). 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I too, 
rise today to honor our dear friend, 
Congressman 
Jim 
Hagedorn. 
It 
is 
amazing that in this day and age with 
all of our differences, proud Minneso-
tans, regardless of our political per-
spective, can stand together in memory 
of one of our great colleagues, and we 
thank everybody in this Chamber for 
doing the same. 
It is fitting that we hold this tribute 
on the House floor. I never saw Jim 
more proud than when he was here in 
this Chamber representing the State of 
Minnesota and the communities that 
he loved so much. 
Jim showed us the best of Minnesota. 
Born in Blue Earth, as Betty told you, 
Jim was born in 1962, and he grew up on 
his family’s farm near Truman, Min-
nesota. The son of former Minnesota

H1172 
February 28, 2022 
Congressman Tom Hagedorn, Jim was 
raised with a lifelong commitment to 
serve. 
After graduating from George Mason 
University, Jim followed in his father’s 
footsteps and pursued a life of public 
service. Jim began his career as a staff-
er to Minnesota Representative Arlan 
Stangeland and then he went on to 
work for the U.S. Treasury and Bureau 
of Engraving and Printing before fi-
nally being elected to the House of 
Representatives in 2018. 
During his time in the House, Jim 
served the First District of Minnesota 
every day with an unwavering passion 
and a positive attitude that brightened 
the Halls of Congress and brought the 
best of Blue Earth to Washington. 
We will all miss Jim dearly, and we 
pray for his family during this difficult 
time. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of the Minnesota delegation and 
on behalf of the great State of Min-
nesota, I respectfully ask that we rec-
ognize the life of Congressman Jim 
Hagedorn with a moment of silence. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
those present in the Chamber, as well 
as Members and staff throughout the 
Capitol, to please rise for a moment of 
silence in remembrance of the late 
Honorable Jim Hagedorn of Minnesota.

Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2022 
No. 36 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Our Father in Heaven, You are our 
place of safety during our seasons of 
trouble. We trust You for security, 
clinging to Your precious promises 
that energize us to persevere. You are 
all we have, and You supply all our 
needs. You are near, so nothing should 
intimidate us. Please surround our Na-
tion and world with the shield of Your 
divine protection. May the weapons 
that come against those who trust in 
Your might fail to prosper. 
Today, show our lawmakers the 
paths that lead to life. Teach them to 
serve You with reverential awe as You 
provide them with the courage to 
please You in all they say and do. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

OFFICER

READING OF WASHINGTON’S 
FAREWELL ADDRESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to the order of the Senate of January 
24, 1901, as amended by the order of 
February 10, 2022, the Senator from 
Vermont, Mr. LEAHY, will now read 
Washington’s Farewell Address. 
Mr. LEAHY, at the rostrum, read the 
Farewell Address, as follows: 
To the people of the United States 
FRIENDS
AND FELLOW-CITIZENS: The 
period for a new election of a citizen to 
administer the executive government 
of the United States being not far dis-
tant, and the time actually arrived 
when your thoughts must be employed 
in designating the person who is to be 
clothed with that important trust, it 
appears to me proper, especially as it 
may conduce to a more distinct expres-
sion of the public voice, that I should 
now apprise you of the resolution I 
have formed, to decline being consid-
ered among the number of those out of 
whom a choice is to be made. 
I beg you at the same time to do me 
the justice to be assured that this reso-
lution has not been taken without a 
strict regard to all the considerations 
appertaining to the relation which 
binds a dutiful citizen to his country— 
and that, in withdrawing the tender of 
service which silence in my situation 
might imply, I am influenced by no 
diminution of zeal for your future in-
terest, no deficiency of grateful respect 
for your past kindness, but am sup-
ported by a full conviction that the 
step is compatible with both. 
The acceptance of, and continuance 
hitherto in, the office to which your 
suffrages have twice called me have 
been a uniform sacrifice of inclination 
to the opinion of duty and to a def-
erence for what appeared to be your de-
sire. I constantly hoped that it would 
have been much earlier in my power, 
consistently with motives which I was 
not at liberty to disregard, to return to 
that retirement from which I had been 
reluctantly drawn. The strength of my 
inclination to do this, previous to the 
last election, had even led to the prepa-
ration of an address to declare it to 
you; but mature reflection on the then 
perplexed and critical posture of our 
affairs with foreign nations, and the 
unanimous advice of persons entitled 
to my confidence, impelled me to aban-
don the idea. 
I rejoice that the state of your con-
cerns, external as well as internal, no 
longer renders the pursuit of inclina-
tion incompatible with the sentiment 
of duty or propriety and am persuaded, 
whatever partiality may be retained 
for my services, that in the present cir-
cumstances of our country you will not 
disapprove my determination to retire. 
The impressions with which I first 
undertook the arduous trust were ex-
plained on the proper occasion. In the 
discharge of this trust, I will only say 
that I have, with good intentions, con-
tributed towards the organization and 
administration of the government the 
best exertions of which a very fallible 
judgment was capable. Not unconscious 
in the outset of the inferiority of my 
qualifications, experience in my own 
eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of 
others, has strengthened the motives 
to diffidence of myself, and every day 
the increasing weight of years admon-
ishes me more and more that the shade 
of retirement is as necessary to me as 
it will be welcome. Satisfied that if 
any circumstances have given peculiar 
value to my services, they were tem-
porary, I have the consolation to be-
lieve that, while choice and prudence 
invite me to quit the political scene, 
patriotism does not forbid it. 
In looking forward to the moment 
which is intended to terminate the ca-
reer of my public life, my feelings do 
not permit me to suspend the deep ac-
knowledgment of that debt of gratitude 
which I owe to my beloved country for 
the many honors it has conferred upon 
me, still more for the steadfast con-
fidence with which it has supported me 
and for the opportunities I have thence 
enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable 
attachment by services faithful and 
persevering, though in usefulness un-
equal to my zeal. If benefits have re-
sulted to our country from these serv-
ices, let it always be remembered to 
your praise and as an instructive exam-
ple in our annals that, under cir-
cumstances in which the passions agi-
tated in every direction were liable to

February 28, 2022 
mislead, 
amidst 
appearances 
some-
times dubious, vicissitudes of fortune 
often discouraging, in situations in 
which not unfrequently want of success 
has countenanced the spirit of criti-
cism, the constancy of your support 
was the essential prop of the efforts 
and a guarantee of the plans by which 
they were effected. Profoundly pene-
trated with this idea, I shall carry it 
with me to my grave as a strong incite-
ment to unceasing vows that Heaven 
may continue to you the choicest to-
kens of its beneficence; that your 
union and brotherly affection may be 
perpetual; that the free constitution, 
which is the work of your hands, may 
be sacredly maintained; that its admin-
istration in every department may be 
stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, 
in fine, the happiness of the people of 
these states, under the auspices of lib-
erty, may be made complete by so care-
ful a preservation and so prudent a use 
of this blessing as will acquire to them 
the glory of recommending it to the ap-
plause, the affection, and adoption of 
every nation which is yet a stranger to 
it. 
Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a 
solicitude for your welfare, which can-
not end but with my life, and the ap-
prehension of danger natural to that 
solicitude, urge me on an occasion like 
the present to offer to your solemn 
contemplation, and to recommend to 
your frequent review, some sentiments 
which are the result of much reflec-
tion, of no inconsiderable observation, 
and which appear to me all important 
to the permanency of your felicity as a 
people. These will be offered to you 
with the more freedom as you can only 
see in them the disinterested warnings 
of a parting friend, who can possibly 
have no personal motive to bias his 
counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encour-
agement to it, your indulgent recep-
tion of my sentiments on a former and 
not dissimilar occasion. 
Interwoven as is the love of liberty 
with every ligament of your hearts, no 
recommendation of mine is necessary 
to fortify or confirm the attachment. 
The unity of government which con-
stitutes you one people is also now 
dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a 
main pillar in the edifice of your real 
independence, the support of your tran-
quility at home, your peace abroad, of 
your safety, of your prosperity, of that 
very liberty which you so highly prize. 
But as it is easy to foresee that, from 
different causes and from different 
quarters, much pains will be taken, 
many artifices employed, to weaken in 
your minds the conviction of this 
truth; as this is the point in your polit-
ical fortress against which the bat-
teries of internal and external enemies 
will be most constantly and actively 
(though often covertly and insidiously) 
directed, it is of infinite moment that 
you should properly estimate the im-
mense value of your national Union to 
your collective and individual happi-
ness; that you should cherish a cordial, 
habitual, and immovable attachment 
to it; accustoming yourselves to think 
and speak of it as of the palladium of 
your political safety and prosperity; 
watching for its preservation with jeal-
ous anxiety; discountenancing what-
ever may suggest even a suspicion that 
it can in any event be abandoned; and 
indignantly frowning upon the first 
dawning of every attempt to alienate 
any portion of our country from the 
rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties 
which now link together the various 
parts. 
For this you have every inducement 
of sympathy and interest. Citizens by 
birth or choice of a common country, 
that country has a right to concentrate 
your affections. The name of American, 
which belongs to you in your national 
capacity, must always exalt the just 
pride of patriotism more than any ap-
pellation derived from local discrimi-
nations. With slight shades of dif-
ference, you have the same religion, 
manners, habits, and political prin-
ciples. You have in a common cause 
fought and triumphed together. The 
independence and liberty you possess 
are the work of joint councils and joint 
efforts—of common dangers, sufferings, 
and successes. 
But these considerations, however 
powerfully they address themselves to 
your 
sensibility, 
are 
greatly 
out-
weighed by those which apply more im-
mediately to your interest. Here every 
portion of our country finds the most 
commanding 
motives 
for 
carefully 
guarding and preserving the Union of 
the whole. 
The North, in an unrestrained inter-
course with the South, protected by 
the equal laws of a common govern-
ment, finds in the productions of the 
latter great additional resources of 
maritime and commercial enterprise 
and precious materials of manufac-
turing industry. The South in the same 
intercourse, benefitting by the agency 
of the North, sees its agriculture grow 
and its commerce expand. Turning 
partly into its own channels the sea-
men of the North, it finds its particular 
navigation invigorated; and while it 
contributes, in different ways, to nour-
ish and increase the general mass of 
the national navigation, it looks for-
ward to the protection of a maritime 
strength to which itself is unequally 
adapted. The East, in a like intercourse 
with the West, already finds, and in the 
progressive improvement of interior 
communications by land and water will 
more and more find a valuable vent for 
the commodities which it brings from 
abroad or manufactures at home. The 
West derives from the East supplies 
requisite to its growth and comfort— 
and what is perhaps of still greater 
consequence, it must of necessity owe 
the secure enjoyment of indispensable 
outlets for its own productions to the 
weight, influence, and the future mari-
time strength of the Atlantic side of 
the Union, directed by an indissoluble 
community of interest as one nation. 
Any other tenure by which the West 
can hold this essential advantage, 
whether derived from its own separate 
strength or from an apostate and un-
natural connection with any foreign 
power, must be intrinsically precar-
ious. 
While then every part of our country 
thus feels an immediate and particular 
interest in union, all the parts com-
bined cannot fail to find in the united 
mass of means and efforts greater 
strength, greater resource, proportion-
ably greater security from external 
danger, a less frequent interruption of 
their peace by foreign nations; and, 
what is of inestimable value! they must 
derive from union an exemption from 
those broils and wars between them-
selves 
which 
so 
frequently 
afflict 
neighboring countries not tied together 
by the same government, which their 
own rivalships alone would be suffi-
cient to produce, but which opposite 
foreign alliances, attachments, and in-
trigues would stimulate and embitter. 
Hence likewise they will avoid the ne-
cessity of those overgrown military es-
tablishments, which under any form of 
government are inauspicious to liberty, 
and which are to be regarded as par-
ticularly hostile to republican liberty. 
In this sense it is, that your Union 
ought to be considered as a main prop 
of your liberty, and that the love of the 
one ought to endear to you the preser-
vation of the other. 
These considerations speak a persua-
sive language to every reflecting and 
virtuous mind and exhibit the continu-
ance of the Union as a primary object 
of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt 
whether a common government can 
embrace so large a sphere? Let experi-
ence solve it. To listen to mere specu-
lation in such a case were criminal. We 
are authorized to hope that a proper 
organization of the whole, with the 
auxiliary agency of governments for 
the respective subdivisions, will afford 
a happy issue to the experiment. It is 
well worth a fair and full experiment. 
With such powerful and obvious mo-
tives to union affecting all parts of our 
country, while experience shall not 
have 
demonstrated 
its 
imprac-
ticability, there will always be reason 
to distrust the patriotism of those who 
in any quarter may endeavor to weak-
en its bands. 
In contemplating the causes which 
may disturb our Union, it occurs as 
matter of serious concern that any 
ground should have been furnished for 
characterizing parties by geographical 
discriminations—northern and south-
ern—Atlantic and western; whence de-
signing men may endeavor to excite a 
belief that there is a real difference of 
local interests and views. One of the 
expedients of party to acquire influ-
ence within particular districts is to 
misrepresent the opinions and aims of 
other districts. You cannot shield 
yourselves 
too 
much 
against 
the 
jealousies and heart burnings which 
spring from these misrepresentations. 
They tend to render alien to each other 
those who ought to be bound together 
by fraternal affection. The inhabitants

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S813 
February 28, 2022 
of our western country have lately had 
a useful lesson on this head. They have 
seen in the negotiation by the execu-
tive—and in the unanimous ratifica-
tion by the Senate—of the treaty with 
Spain, and in the universal satisfaction 
at that event throughout the United 
States, a decisive proof how unfounded 
were the suspicions propagated among 
them of a policy in the general govern-
ment and in the Atlantic states un-
friendly to their interests in regard to 
the Mississippi. They have been wit-
nesses to the formation of two treaties, 
that with Great Britain and that with 
Spain, which secure to them every-
thing they could desire, in respect to 
our foreign relations, towards con-
firming their prosperity. Will it not be 
their wisdom to rely for the preserva-
tion of these advantages on the Union 
by which they were procured? Will they 
not henceforth be deaf to those advis-
ers, if such there are, who would sever 
them from their brethren and connect 
them with aliens? 
To the efficacy and permanency of 
your Union, a government for the 
whole is indispensable. No alliances, 
however strict, between the parts can 
be an adequate substitute. They must 
inevitably experience the infractions 
and interruptions which all alliances in 
all times have experienced. Sensible of 
this momentous truth, you have im-
proved upon your first essay by the 
adoption of a Constitution of govern-
ment 
better 
calculated 
than 
your 
former for an intimate Union and for 
the efficacious management of your 
common concerns. This government, 
the 
offspring 
of 
our 
own 
choice 
uninfluenced 
and 
unawed, 
adopted 
upon full investigation and mature de-
liberation, completely free in its prin-
ciples, in the distribution of its powers 
uniting security with energy, and con-
taining within itself a provision for its 
own amendment, has a just claim to 
your confidence and your support. Re-
spect for its authority, compliance 
with its laws, acquiescence in its meas-
ures, are duties enjoined by the funda-
mental maxims of true liberty. The 
basis of our political systems is the 
right of the people to make and to 
alter their constitutions of govern-
ment. But the Constitution which at 
any time exists, until changed by an 
explicit and authentic act of the whole 
people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. 
The very idea of the power and the 
right of the people to establish govern-
ment presupposes the duty of every in-
dividual to obey the established gov-
ernment. 
All obstructions to the execution of 
the laws, all combinations and associa-
tions under whatever plausible char-
acter with the real design to direct, 
control, counteract, or awe the regular 
deliberation and action of the con-
stituted authorities, are destructive of 
this fundamental principle and of fatal 
tendency. They serve to organize fac-
tion; to give it an artificial and ex-
traordinary force; to put in the place of 
the delegated will of the nation the 
will of a party, often a small but artful 
and enterprising minority of the com-
munity; and, according to the alter-
nate triumphs of different parties, to 
make the public administration the 
mirror of the ill concerted and incon-
gruous projects of faction, rather than 
the organ of consistent and wholesome 
plans digested by common councils and 
modified by mutual interests. However 
combinations or associations of the 
above description may now and then 
answer popular ends, they are likely, in 
the course of time and things, to be-
come potent engines by which cunning, 
ambitious, and unprincipled men will 
be enabled to subvert the power of the 
people and to usurp for themselves the 
reins of government, destroying after-
wards the very engines which have lift-
ed them to unjust dominion. 
Towards the preservation of your 
government and the permanency of 
your present happy state, it is req-
uisite not only that you steadily dis-
countenance irregular oppositions to 
its acknowledged authority but also 
that you resist with care the spirit of 
innovation upon its principles, however 
specious the pretexts. One method of 
assault may be to effect in the forms of 
the Constitution alterations which will 
impair the energy of the system and 
thus to undermine what cannot be di-
rectly overthrown. In all the changes 
to which you may be invited, remem-
ber that time and habit are at least as 
necessary to fix the true character of 
governments as of other human insti-
tutions, that experience is the surest 
standard by which to test the real 
tendency of the existing constitution 
of a country, that facility in changes 
upon the credit of mere hypotheses and 
opinion exposes to perpetual change 
from the endless variety of hypotheses 
and opinion; and remember, especially, 
that for the efficient management of 
your common interests in a country so 
extensive as ours, a government of as 
much vigor as is consistent with the 
perfect security of liberty is indispen-
sable; liberty itself will find in such a 
government, with powers properly dis-
tributed and adjusted, its surest guard-
ian. It is indeed little else than a name, 
where the government is too feeble to 
withstand the enterprises of faction, to 
confine each member of the society 
within the limits prescribed by the 
laws, and to maintain all in the secure 
and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of 
person and property. 
I have already intimated to you the 
danger of parties in the state, with par-
ticular reference to the founding of 
them on geographical discriminations. 
Let me now take a more comprehen-
sive view and warn you in the most sol-
emn manner against the baneful effects 
of the spirit of party, generally. 
This spirit, unfortunately, is insepa-
rable from our nature, having its root 
in the strongest passions of the human 
mind. It exists under different shapes 
in all governments, more or less sti-
fled, controlled, or repressed; but in 
those of the popular form it is seen in 
its greatest rankness and is truly their 
worst enemy. 
The alternate domination of one fac-
tion over another, sharpened by the 
spirit of revenge natural to party dis-
sension, which in different ages and 
countries has perpetrated the most 
horrid enormities, is itself a frightful 
despotism. But this leads at length to a 
more formal and permanent despotism. 
The disorders and miseries which re-
sult gradually incline the minds of men 
to seek security and repose in the abso-
lute power of an individual; and sooner 
or later the chief of some prevailing 
faction, more able or more fortunate 
than his competitors, turns this dis-
position to the purposes of his own ele-
vation on the ruins of public liberty. 
Without looking forward to an ex-
tremity of this kind (which neverthe-
less ought not to be entirely out of 
sight) the common and continual mis-
chiefs of the spirit of party are suffi-
cient to make it the interest and the 
duty of a wise people to discourage and 
restrain it. 
It serves always to distract the pub-
lic councils and enfeeble the public ad-
ministration. It agitates the commu-
nity with ill founded jealousies and 
false alarms, kindles the animosity of 
one part against another, foments oc-
casionally riot and insurrection. It 
opens the door to foreign influence and 
corruption, which find a facilitated ac-
cess to the government itself through 
the channels of party passions. Thus 
the policy and the will of one country 
are subjected to the policy and will of 
another. 
There is an opinion that parties in 
free countries are useful checks upon 
the administration of the government 
and serve to keep alive the spirit of lib-
erty. This within certain limits is prob-
ably true—and in governments of a mo-
narchical cast patriotism may look 
with indulgence, if not with favor, 
upon the spirit of party. But in those of 
the popular character, in governments 
purely elective, it is a spirit not to be 
encouraged. From their natural tend-
ency, it is certain there will always be 
enough of that spirit for every salutary 
purpose. And there being constant dan-
ger of excess, the effort ought to be by 
force of public opinion to mitigate and 
assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it 
demands a uniform vigilance to pre-
vent its bursting into a flame, lest in-
stead of warming it should consume. 
It is important, likewise, that the 
habits of thinking in a free country 
should inspire caution in those en-
trusted with its administration to con-
fine themselves within their respective 
constitutional spheres, avoiding in the 
exercise of the powers of one depart-
ment to encroach upon another. The 
spirit of encroachment tends to con-
solidate the powers of all the depart-
ments in one and thus to create, what-
ever the form of government, a real 
despotism. A just estimate of that love 
of power and proneness to abuse it 
which predominates in the human 
heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the

truth of this position. The necessity of 
reciprocal checks in the exercise of po-
litical power, by dividing and distrib-
uting it into different depositories and 
constituting each the guardian of the 
public weal against invasions by the 
others, has been evinced by experi-
ments ancient and modern, some of 
them in our country and under our own 
eyes. To preserve them must be as nec-
essary as to institute them. If in the 
opinion of the people the distribution 
or modification of the constitutional 
powers be in any particular wrong, let 
it be corrected by an amendment in the 
way which the Constitution designates. 
But let there be no change by usurpa-
tion; for though this, in one instance, 
may be the instrument of good, it is 
the customary weapon by which free 
governments are destroyed. The prece-
dent must always greatly overbalance 
in permanent evil any partial or tran-
sient benefit which the use can at any 
time yield. 
Of all the dispositions and habits 
which lead to political prosperity, reli-
gion and morality are indispensable 
supports. In vain would that man claim 
the tribute of patriotism who should 
labor to subvert these great pillars of 
human happiness, these firmest props 
of the duties of men and citizens. The 
mere politician, equally with the pious 
man, ought to respect and to cherish 
them. A volume could not trace all 
their connections with private and pub-
lic felicity. Let it simply be asked 
where is the security for property, for 
reputation, for life, if the sense of reli-
gious 
obligation 
desert 
the 
oaths, 
which are the instruments of investiga-
tion in courts of justice? And let us 
with caution indulge the supposition 
that morality can be maintained with-
out religion. Whatever may be con-
ceded to the influence of refined edu-
cation on minds of peculiar structure, 
reason and experience both forbid us to 
expect that national morality can pre-
vail in exclusion of religious principle. 
It is substantially true that virtue or 
morality is a necessary spring of pop-
ular government. The rule indeed ex-
tends with more or less force to every 
species of free government. Who that is 
a sincere friend to it can look with in-
difference upon attempts to shake the 
foundation of the fabric? 
Promote then, as an object of pri-
mary importance, institutions for the 
general diffusion of knowledge. In pro-
portion as the structure of a govern-
ment gives force to public opinion, it is 
essential that public opinion should be 
enlightened. 
As 
a 
very 
important 
source 
of 
strength and security, cherish public 
credit. One method of preserving it is 
to use it as sparingly as possible, 
avoiding occasions of expense by culti-
vating peace, but remembering also 
that timely disbursements to prepare 
for danger frequently prevent much 
greater 
disbursements 
to 
repel 
it; 
avoiding likewise the accumulation of 
debt, not only by shunning occasions of 
expense, but by vigorous exertions in 
time of peace to discharge the debts 
which unavoidable wars may have oc-
casioned, not ungenerously throwing 
upon posterity the burden which we 
ourselves ought to bear. The execution 
of these maxims belongs to your rep-
resentatives, but it is necessary that 
public opinion should cooperate. To fa-
cilitate to them the performance of 
their duty, it is essential that you 
should practically bear in mind that 
towards the payment of debts there 
must be revenue; that to have revenue 
there must be taxes; that no taxes can 
be devised which are not more or less 
inconvenient and unpleasant; that the 
intrinsic embarrassment inseparable 
from the selection of the proper objects 
(which is always a choice of difficul-
ties) ought to be a decisive motive for 
a candid construction of the conduct of 
the government in making it, and for a 
spirit of acquiescence in the measures 
for obtaining revenue which the public 
exigencies may at any time dictate. 
Observe good faith and justice to-
wards all nations; cultivate peace and 
harmony with all; religion and moral-
ity enjoin this conduct, and can it be 
that good policy does not equally en-
join it? It will be worthy of a free, en-
lightened, and, at no distant period, a 
great nation, to give to mankind the 
magnanimous and too novel example of 
a people always guided by an exalted 
justice and benevolence. Who can doubt 
that in the course of time and things 
the fruits of such a plan would richly 
repay any temporary advantages which 
might be lost by a steady adherence to 
it? Can it be, that Providence has not 
connected the permanent felicity of a 
nation with its virtue? The experiment, 
at least, is recommended by every sen-
timent which ennobles human nature. 
Alas! is it rendered impossible by its 
vices? 
In the execution of such a plan noth-
ing is more essential than that perma-
nent, inveterate antipathies against 
particular nations and passionate at-
tachments for others should be ex-
cluded and that in place of them just 
and 
amicable 
feelings 
towards 
all 
should be cultivated. The nation which 
indulges towards another an habitual 
hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in 
some degree a slave. It is a slave to its 
animosity or to its affection, either of 
which is sufficient to lead it astray 
from its duty and its interest. Antip-
athy in one nation against another dis-
poses each more readily to offer insult 
and injury, to lay hold of slight causes 
of umbrage, and to be haughty and in-
tractable when accidental or trifling 
occasions of dispute occur. Hence fre-
quent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, 
and 
bloody 
contests. 
The 
nation, 
prompted by ill will and resentment, 
sometimes impels to war the govern-
ment, contrary to the best calculations 
of policy. The government sometimes 
participates in the national propensity 
and adopts through passion what rea-
son would reject; at other times, it 
makes the animosity of the nation sub-
servient to projects of hostility insti-
gated by pride, ambition and other sin-
ister and pernicious motives. The peace 
often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, 
of nations has been the victim. 
So likewise, a passionate attachment 
of one nation for another produces a 
variety of evils. Sympathy for the fa-
vorite nation, facilitating the illusion 
of an imaginary common interest in 
cases where no real common interest 
exists and infusing into one the enmi-
ties of the other, betrays the former 
into a participation in the quarrels and 
wars of the latter, without adequate in-
ducement or justification. It leads also 
to concessions to the favorite nation of 
privileges denied to others, which is 
apt doubly to injure the nation making 
the concessions, by unnecessarily part-
ing with what ought to have been re-
tained and by exciting jealousy, ill 
will, and a disposition to retaliate in 
the parties from whom equal privileges 
are withheld. And it gives to ambi-
tious, corrupted, or deluded citizens 
(who devote themselves to the favorite 
nation) facility to betray or sacrifice 
the interests of their own country 
without odium, sometimes even with 
popularity, gilding with the appear-
ances of a virtuous sense of obligation, 
a commendable deference for public 
opinion, or a laudable zeal for public 
good, the base or foolish compliances 
of ambition, corruption, or infatuation. 
As avenues to foreign influence in in-
numerable ways, such attachments are 
particularly alarming to the truly en-
lightened and independent patriot. How 
many opportunities do they afford to 
tamper with domestic factions, to prac-
tice the arts of seduction, to mislead 
public opinion, to influence or awe the 
public councils! Such an attachment of 
a small or weak towards a great and 
powerful nation dooms the former to be 
the satellite of the latter. 
Against the insidious wiles of foreign 
influence (I conjure you to believe me, 
fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free 
people ought to be constantly awake, 
since history and experience prove that 
foreign influence is one of the most 
baneful foes of republican government. 
But that jealousy to be useful must be 
impartial; else it becomes the instru-
ment of the very influence to be avoid-
ed, instead of a defense against it. Ex-
cessive partiality for one foreign na-
tion and excessive dislike of another 
cause those whom they actuate to see 
danger only on one side, and serve to 
veil and even second the arts of influ-
ence on the other. Real patriots, who 
may resist the intrigues of the favor-
ite, are liable to become suspected and 
odious, while its tools and dupes usurp 
the applause and confidence of the peo-
ple to surrender their interests. 
The great rule of conduct for us in re-
gard to foreign nations is, in extending 
our commercial relations, to have with 
them as little political connection as 
possible. So far as we have already 
formed engagements, let them be ful-
filled with perfect good faith. Here let 
us stop. 
Europe has a set of primary inter-
ests, which to us have none or a very

remote relation. Hence she must be en-
gaged in frequent controversies, the 
causes of which are essentially foreign 
to our concerns. Hence therefore it 
must be unwise in us to implicate our-
selves, by artificial ties, in the ordi-
nary vicissitudes of her politics or the 
ordinary combinations and collisions of 
her friendships or enmities. 
Our detached and distant situation 
invites and enables us to pursue a dif-
ferent course. If we remain one people 
under an efficient government, the pe-
riod is not far off when we may defy 
material injury from external annoy-
ance; when we may take such an atti-
tude as will cause the neutrality we 
may at any time resolve upon to be 
scrupulously respected; when bellig-
erent nations, under the impossibility 
of making acquisitions upon us, will 
not lightly hazard the giving us provo-
cation; when we may choose peace or 
war, as our interest guided by justice 
shall counsel. 
Why forgo the advantages of so pecu-
liar a situation? Why quit our own to 
stand upon foreign ground? Why, by 
interweaving our destiny with that of 
any part of Europe, entangle our peace 
and prosperity in the toils of European 
ambition, rival-ship, interest, humor, 
or caprice? 
It is our true policy to steer clear of 
permanent alliances with any portion 
of the foreign world—so far, I mean, as 
we are now at liberty to do it, for let 
me not be understood as capable of pa-
tronizing infidelity to existing engage-
ments (I hold the maxim no less appli-
cable to public than to private affairs, 
that honesty is always the best pol-
icy)—I repeat it therefore, let those en-
gagements be observed in their genuine 
sense. But in my opinion it is unneces-
sary and would be unwise to extend 
them. 
Taking care always to keep our-
selves, by suitable establishments, on a 
respectably defensive posture, we may 
safely trust to temporary alliances for 
extraordinary emergencies. 
Harmony, liberal intercourse with all 
nations, are recommended by policy, 
humanity, and interest. But even our 
commercial policy should hold an 
equal and impartial hand: neither seek-
ing nor granting exclusive favors or 
preferences; 
consulting the natural 
course of things; diffusing and diversi-
fying by gentle means the streams of 
commerce but forcing nothing; estab-
lishing with powers so disposed—in 
order to give to trade a stable course, 
to define the rights of our merchants, 
and to enable the government to sup-
port them—conventional rules of inter-
course, the best that present cir-
cumstances and mutual opinion will 
permit, but temporary, and liable to be 
from time to time abandoned or varied, 
as experience and circumstances shall 
dictate; constantly keeping in view, 
that it is folly in one nation to look for 
disinterested favors from another— 
that it must pay with a portion of its 
independence for whatever it may ac-
cept under that character—that by 
such acceptance it may place itself in 
the condition of having given equiva-
lents for nominal favors and yet of 
being reproached with ingratitude for 
not giving more. There can be no great-
er error than to expect or calculate 
upon real favors from nation to nation. 
It is an illusion which experience must 
cure, which a just pride ought to dis-
card. 
In offering to you, my countrymen, 
these counsels of an old and affec-
tionate friend, I dare not hope they 
will make the strong and lasting im-
pression I could wish—that they will 
control the usual current of the pas-
sions or prevent our nation from run-
ning the course which has hitherto 
marked the destiny of nations. But if I 
may even flatter myself that they may 
be productive of some partial benefit, 
some occasional good, that they may 
now and then recur to moderate the 
fury of party spirit, to warn against 
the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to 
guard against the impostures of pre-
tended patriotism—this hope will be a 
full recompense for the solicitude for 
your welfare by which they have been 
dictated. 
How far in the discharge of my offi-
cial duties I have been guided by the 
principles which have been delineated, 
the public records and other evidences 
of my conduct must witness to you and 
to the world. To myself, the assurance 
of my own conscience is that I have at 
least believed myself to be guided by 
them. 
In relation to the still subsisting war 
in Europe, my proclamation of the 22d 
of April 1793 is the index to my plan. 
Sanctioned by your approving voice 
and by that of your representatives in 
both houses of Congress, the spirit of 
that measure has continually governed 
me, uninfluenced by any attempts to 
deter or divert me from it. 
After deliberate examination with 
the aid of the best lights I could ob-
tain, I was well satisfied that our coun-
try, under all the circumstances of the 
case, had a right to take—and was 
bound in duty and interest to take—a 
neutral position. Having taken it, I de-
termined, as far as should depend upon 
me, to maintain it with moderation, 
perseverence, and firmness. 
The considerations which respect the 
right to hold this conduct it is not nec-
essary on this occasion to detail. I will 
only observe that, according to my un-
derstanding of the matter, that right, 
so far from being denied by any of the 
belligerent powers, has been virtually 
admitted by all. 
The duty of holding a neutral con-
duct may be inferred, without anything 
more, from the obligation which jus-
tice and humanity impose on every na-
tion, in cases in which it is free to act, 
to maintain inviolate the relations of 
peace and amity towards other nations. 
The inducements of interest for ob-
serving that conduct will best be re-
ferred to your own reflections and ex-
perience. With me, a predominant mo-
tive has been to endeavor to gain time 
to our country to settle and mature its 
yet recent institutions and to progress 
without interruption to that degree of 
strength and consistency which is nec-
essary to give it, humanly speaking, 
the command of its own fortunes. 
Though in reviewing the incidents of 
my administration I am unconscious of 
intentional error, I am nevertheless 
too sensible of my defects not to think 
it probable that I may have committed 
many errors. Whatever they may be, I 
fervently beseech the Almighty to 
avert or mitigate the evils to which 
they may tend. I shall also carry with 
me the hope that my country will 
never cease to view them with indul-
gence and that, after forty-five years of 
my life dedicated to its service with an 
upright zeal, the faults of incompetent 
abilities will be consigned to oblivion, 
as myself must soon be to the man-
sions of rest. 
Relying on its kindness in this as in 
other things, and actuated by that fer-
vent love towards it which is so nat-
ural to a man who views in it the na-
tive soil of himself and his progenitors 
for several generations, I anticipate 
with pleasing expectation that retreat, 
in which I promise myself to realize 
without alloy the sweet enjoyment of 
partaking in the midst of my fellow 
citizens the benign influence of good 
laws under a free government—the ever 
favorite object of my heart, and the 
happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual 
cares, labors and dangers.

ADDRESS

first, I want to compliment Senator

wonderful reading of George Washing-
ton’s Address. This is a tradition in the 
Senate, and I am very glad we are con-

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now, on world affairs, today I chose the

REMEMBERING RICHARD C. BLUM 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, I was deeply saddened this morn-
ing to learn of the passing of my friend, 
and our dear colleague, Dick Blum, 
husband of over 40 years to our friend 
and colleague Senator FEINSTEIN. Sen-
ator FEINSTEIN is our Senate colleague, 
but Dick Blum was also a colleague be-
cause he was a friend and adviser to so 
many of us. 
In his 86 years, Dick truly led a re-
markable life. He was a force of nature, 
gifted with a winning smile and keen 
intellect that he applied to the benefit 
of California, America, and even inter-
national causes, including the Amer-
ican Himalayan Foundation, because 
he cared so much about those folks. 
Every now and then, he would call me 
with his frequently insightful—often 
brilliant—ideas. The only problem was 
his enthusiasm was so intense, it was 
sometimes hard to get him off the 
phone. 
He was a strong and wonderful part-
ner to Senator FEINSTEIN, and he 
fought valiantly against illness in the 
final chapters of his life—a life so well 
lived. 
Our thoughts are with our friend Sen-
ator FEINSTEIN. She and he were so 
close. She was so dependent on him and 
he on her. And so our thoughts are 
with her during this time of mourning. 
We join her in both our grief and in re-
membering Dick’s wonderful legacy. 
I talked with Senator FEINSTEIN this 
afternoon. And I told her that when my 
father passed away a few months ago, I 
felt a loss, but some of the pain—a lit-
tle bit—was sad because I would feel I 
was so close to him, he is still with me. 
And I told her that is how I believed 
Dick will be with her. And she told me 
that gave her a little solace, so that 
made me feel OK. 
f 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now, next, on Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson, on Friday, Joe Biden—Presi-
dent Biden—made history, wonderful 
history, by announcing his nominee to 
replace Stephen Breyer on the U.S. Su-
preme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson. 
As promised, President Biden named, 
for the first time in history—the first 
time in history—a Black woman to sit 
on the High Court. As promised, his 
nominee is beyond qualified and bril-
liant. And as promised, the Senate will 
now begin the work of quickly con-
firming Judge Jackson to the Supreme 
Court of the United States of America. 
Appointing individuals to the High 
Court, as we all know, is truly one of 
the awesome responsibilities of any 
President. And in choosing Judge Jack-
son, President Biden has hit a home 
run with an evenhanded and so gifted 
jurist. 
More importantly, I congratulate 
Judge Jackson for this historic honor— 
one that reflects her skills, her accom-
plishments, and, above all, her dedica-
tion to our democracy. I have been 
doing a lot of reading on Judge Jack-
son over the last month, and I cannot 
recall any one of her colleagues, any-
one from her private life, or anyone in 
the public sphere say anything nega-
tive about her. It is amazing. That is 
how fine a person she is and how fine a 
mind she has. Judge Jackson encap-
sulates the two b’s: brilliant and be-
loved. That is a rare combination. And 
her nomination is a cause for immense 
celebration. 
I will be meeting with Judge Jackson 
Wednesday when she comes to the Cap-
itol for the first time. Meanwhile, I am 
working with Chairman DURBIN
to 
schedule 
confirmation 
hearings 
on 
Judge Jackson as soon as we can. Once 
the Judiciary Committee completes its 
consideration of Judge Jackson, I will 
move to have her nomination come im-
mediately to the floor of the Senate so 
the Senate wastes no time fulfilling its 
constitutional duty. We are going to 
have a fair but speedy process where 
Members from both sides will get to 
ask their questions and explore the 
judge’s record. 
Of course, Judge Jackson is no 
stranger to the Senate. This will be the 
fourth 
time—the 
fourth 
time—she 
comes before this body. In each pre-
vious instance, Republicans and Demo-
crats together voted in favor of her 
various nominations. We voted last 
year to confirm Judge Jackson to the 
influential DC Circuit Court of Ap-
peals, and she received support from all 
50 Democrats and 3 Republicans. And, 
of course, the first time she came be-
fore us as a district court judge, it was 
a voice vote, which meant no one ob-
jected to her getting on the Federal 
bench—no one in the Senate, anyway. 
Judge Jackson’s various nominations 
have won bipartisan support in the 
past, and her nomination now merits 
bipartisan support in the present. I 
hope both sides can work together in a 
fair and speedy way to make it happen. 
I will have more to say on Judge 
Jackson’s remarkable profile in the 
days and weeks ahead, but today, I 
want to congratulate her on her nomi-
nation. I thank President Biden for se-
lecting her, and I look forward to meet-
ing with her on Wednesday when she 
arrives at the Capitol. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Today is the fifth 
day since Russian President Vladimir 
Putin undermined decades—decades— 
of stability in Europe by launching an 
unprovoked, immoral, and terribly vio-
lent, vicious assault on Ukraine. This 
evening, the Senate will receive a clas-
sified update from the administration 
that Senator MCCONNELL and I have re-
quested, and we will be briefed on the 
situation on the ground and the steps 
that President Biden has taken to help 
the Ukrainian people. 
In the coming weeks, the Senate will 
also work on a bipartisan basis and in 
lockstep with the Biden administration 
to build a robust assistance package 
for Ukraine. The administration has 
asked for a $6.4 billion package of hu-
manitarian aid, of economic aid, and of 
the kind of military aid that will help 
the Ukrainians defend themselves, and 
we intend to work on a bipartisan basis 
to include it in the upcoming omnibus 
bill. 
Already, the reports of civilian cas-
ualties in Ukraine are just tragic. At 
least 350 civilians have been killed ac-
cording to the Ukrainian Government. 
But amidst the violence, one thing is 
clear: the Ukrainian people are giving 
Putin a tougher fight than he, in his 
monomaniacal 
overconfidence, 
bar-
gained for. 
There are two people in particular 
who deserve recognition in these early 
days: President Zelenskyy and Presi-
dent Biden. On the one hand, President 
Zelenskyy is facing the worst night-
mare any head of state can face: a full 
assault on his country’s sovereignty. 
But his bravery and defiance is inspir-
ing. Many said he should leave the 
country. Putin thought he would run 
away. He said: Even though I may be 
their No. 1 target, I am staying. What 
courage. What strength. And it gave 
the Ukrainian people and all the people 
in the Western world courage and 
strength as well to unite and do every-
thing we can, each in our own way, to 
help the Ukrainian people keep their 
independence, their freedom, and their 
sovereignty. President Zelenskyy is ad-
mired all around the globe and most by 
the Ukrainian people whom he stood so 
strong for.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S817 
February 28, 2022 
President Biden also deserves cred-
it—credit that is due him for success-
fully bringing democracies together 
against Putin with crushing sanctions 
and an outpouring of security assist-
ance. Today, President Putin is more 
isolated than ever before while democ-
racies have rallied together, and this is 
much to the credit of President Biden. 
He has done an amazing job. 
Here in the United States, we stand 
unflinchingly 
with 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine. Twenty-one years ago, in the 
aftermath of 9/11, Americans rallied to-
gether after our democracy was at-
tacked here at home. Today, as democ-
racy is under assault, we must come 
together in solidarity with the Ukrain-
ian people. We should all be together 
supporting this country’s efforts. 
When I said the President did an 
amazing job, here is one thing I was re-
ferring to: No one thought that the Eu-
ropeans would go along with removing 
parts of the SWIFT system from the 
Russian 
financial 
system; 
no 
one 
thought that we would sanction the 
Russian Central Bank—two of the most 
powerful weapons we have, but the Eu-
ropeans were going to be reluctant. Be-
cause President Biden was strong, was 
patient, was persistent, and didn’t let 
himself get pushed around by would-be 
critics, that is now happening. Over the 
next several months—even now, today, 
but even more so as time goes on— 
those are going to have severe effects 
on President Putin. 
So he deserves a lot of credit, and I 
just hope we will all, all of us, come to-
gether, just as we did after 9/11 when 
freedom was under assault in our own 
country, and rally, united in sup-
porting the President and what he is 
doing. 
f 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. On the Women’s 
Healthcare Protection Act, later today, 
the Senate is going to vote on a simple 
yet urgent question: Will this Chamber 
agree to begin debate on protecting a 
women’s 
right 
to 
make 
her 
own 
healthcare choices? 
Across the country, it is a dark, dark 
time for women’s reproductive rights. 
Last year, we saw the most—the 
most—abortion restrictions passed by 
State legislatures in a single year. 
Some of them were almost vicious—the 
vigilantism of Texas’s law. I call it vi-
cious vigilantism. Many of these new 
laws are downright extreme, effec-
tively extinguishing women’s ability to 
even exercise their rights at all. The 
new, extreme restrictions fly largely in 
the face of public opinion. They also fly 
in the face of commonsense health 
practices. Frankly, they fly against 
common decency itself, and sadly it 
seems like the Supreme Court is close 
to drastically restricting this long-es-
tablished right in the coming months. 
So the Senate today is going to take 
action because abortion has never been 
more at risk in America. Indeed, this 
will be the first time the Senate takes 
a 
vote 
on 
a 
stand-alone 
bill 
to 
proactively codify Roe. Let me say 
that again. This will be the first time 
that the Senate takes a vote on a 
stand-alone bill to proactively codify 
Roe. Every American—every Amer-
ican—deserves to know where his or 
her Senator stands on an issue as im-
portant as the right to choose, and to-
day’s vote will do that. 
From the moment that Roe was de-
cided in 1973, the most extreme ele-
ments of the Republican Party have 
plotted its demise. The Federalist Soci-
ety was founded with the intent of cul-
tivating a generation of judges loyal to 
conservative causes. 
Sadly, it seems like the Supreme 
Court is posed to severely limit abor-
tion rights in the coming months. That 
is why this bill is essential. 
Congress must codify into law what 
most Americans have long believed— 
that abortion is a fundamental right 
and that women’s decisions over wom-
en’s healthcare belong to women, not— 
not—to extremist rightwing legisla-
tures. 
We must vote in favor to hold a de-
bate on this bill. I will proudly, strong-
ly vote yes. I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
f 
POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, on postal, 
this week, the Senate is also going to 
keep working to pass long-overdue 
postal reform to strengthen mail deliv-
eries, take care of our postal workers, 
and put the post office on a path to 
long-term stability. 
I want to be clear that this bill has 
enough bipartisan support to ulti-
mately become law. It is the product of 
weeks and months of good-faith nego-
tiation by my colleagues, especially 
my friend Senator PETERS. We could 
have passed postal reform at the end of 
the last work period were it not for the 
capricious obstruction from the Sen-
ator from Florida. Nevertheless, postal 
reform remains on the right track, and 
I expect we will be able to send it to 
the President’s desk very soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
last week, Putin again invaded the sov-
ereign territory of a neighboring coun-
try. Sadly, it was long clear that at-
tempts to invoke genteel international 
norms would not move this self-styled 
czar. 
Putin only cares about norms insofar 
as he wants to rewrite them. He only 
cares about the peaceful international 
order insofar as he wants to disrupt it. 
Like his Soviet predecessors, Putin 
has always rejected the postwar order 
that held up states’ sovereignty and 
territorial 
integrity 
as 
sacrosanct. 
Putin and Xi of China both want to re-
place this peaceful order with spheres 
of influence. 
They want to bend other countries to 
their will and redraw borders by force. 
Make no mistake, this crisis does not 
and will not end with Ukraine. And the 
reason isn’t simply that appetites grow 
with eating. Confrontation with the 
West is Putin’s main objective. 
He wants to restore the Russian em-
pire. He said explicitly, he wants NATO 
rolled back to its 1997 borders. We have 
a dictator trying to dismember a U.S. 
partner, trying to decapitate its demo-
cratically elected government. 
Does anybody really think it stops 
here? Does anybody think that Europe, 
or for that matter, Taiwan, will be safe 
if the world lets this stand? 
We will only deter further Russian 
and Chinese aggression if Putin is 
made to pay a significant price. Mas-
sive and sustained sanctions that un-
dermine his ability to wage war, now 
and into the future, will be necessary. 
But sanctions alone will not suffice. 
Russia has massive currency reserves. 
It has options to blunt economic pain 
and to impose countercosts on America 
and our partners, at least in the near 
term. The sanctions that would hurt 
Moscow the most would also have a 
significant impact on our friends in Eu-
rope. So there will continue to be re-
sistance to maximalist sanctions. 
To date, the Biden administration 
has sent mixed messages about its own 
sanctions policy. For months, we heard 
that prospective sanctions were being 
drafted to deter Putin’s aggression. 
But last week, the President said he 
and his advisers never thought sanc-
tions would deter Russia. Now, they 
are finally imposing sanctions but 
short of everything that is available. 
So to what end exactly? What is the 
administration’s coherent plan? I be-
lieve we should have used more of these 
tools prior to this brutal escalation to 
deter Putin and to weaken his capacity 
to wage war. Now, we must use these 
tools aggressively to impose massive 
costs for Putin’s aggression, to dem-
onstrate to other aggressors that we 
mean business, and to degrade Putin’s 
longer-term ability to threaten NATO 
and compete with the West. 
But ultimately, sanctions are no sub-
stitute for military power. They are no 
substitute for the steps we must take

February 28, 2022 
to help Ukraine now and to defend our-
selves in the future. Moscow and Bei-
jing will only be deterred from aggres-
sion if they see concretely that mili-
tary force cannot achieve their objec-
tives and the cost of military aggres-
sion will be too high. 
In the immediate term, we must en-
sure the Ukrainians can adequately de-
fend themselves and impose costs on 
Russia that prove prohibitive. The ad-
ministration brags about giving $650 
million to Ukraine last year, but the 
manner in which it did so deserves 
scrutiny. 
When Putin built up forces along 
Ukraine’s border last spring, the Biden 
administration delayed an arms assist-
ance package, literally, for months. 
A headline from last June read: 
‘‘White House freezes Ukraine military 
package that includes lethal weapons.’’ 
Even as Putin began directly threat-
ening Ukraine last fall, an assistance 
package languished for weeks at the 
White House before it was approved. 
This 
weekend, 
the 
administration 
rushed to announce another $350 mil-
lion in military assistance. For which 
weapons? On what timeline? And how 
will the weapons reach the brave 
Ukrainians who have lost ground? 
So Congress must use its oversight 
tools 
to 
ensure 
we 
are 
providing 
Ukraine the weapons it needs as quick-
ly as possible. The same goes for help-
ing to shore up our NATO allies’ de-
fenses along the eastern flank. And we 
need to identify what shortfalls, red-
tape, and limiting factors have slowed 
our assistance, so we are better pre-
pared to help the next partner in need. 
As I have warned repeatedly, we can-
not afford to move at the speed of bu-
reaucracy. 
Beyond 
the 
immediate 
crisis 
in 
Ukraine, American Presidents, begin-
ning with President Biden, must re-
commit our Nation to the longer-term 
challenges that we face. Seventy-two 
years ago, Harry Truman led the West 
in rebuffing the Communist assault in 
South Korea, as well as contesting So-
viet domination over Europe. 
America made sure NATO would not 
be a toothless political alliance, but 
rather a capable military fighting 
force. This meant sustained investment 
in 
American 
and 
allied 
military 
strength. Defense funding was the pre-
condition for impactful diplomacy that 
kept the Cold War from going hot. 
Now, it is this President’s job to seri-
ously meet the growing threats posed 
by Russia and China. The United 
States and our allies and partners must 
understand that the core of our com-
petition with Russia and China is the 
military dimension. 
President Biden’s first budget pro-
posed to actually cut defense spending 
in real terms. Congress had to take bi-
partisan action to beef up the NDAA to 
correct his error. Clearly, more invest-
ment is needed. Congress must keep 
strengthening defense capabilities as 
we work on appropriations. 
But President Biden must lead by ex-
ample. The President’s next budget re-
quest must include at least a 5-percent 
increase in defense spending above in-
flation. 
Russia and China have prioritized 
military modernization literally for 
decades. 
They have invested in specific tools 
like long-range aerial defenses and 
hypersonic weapons that are designed 
to push the U.S. and our allies further 
away from the fight. 
We are actually behind in this com-
petition. 
We 
are 
actually 
behind. 
Hypersonic 
weapons, 
nuclear 
force 
modernization, power projection, glob-
al presence—these things cost money. 
It is a small price to pay for keeping 
security threats off of our shores. I 
have criticized NATO allies who failed 
to contribute fully to our collective se-
curity, but I am a strong supporter of 
the transatlantic alliance. I am encour-
aged by how our partners have re-
sponded, however belatedly, to the 
growing threat posed to our collective 
security. 
For example, special praise to the 
courageous 
decision 
by 
Chancellor 
Scholz this weekend to seek an emer-
gency appropriation of 100 billion euros 
for the German military. This effec-
tively 
doubles 
Germany’s 
military 
budget this year—doubles Germany’s 
military budget this year. 
He wants Germany to fulfill its 
pledge to spend 2 percent of GDP on de-
fense. He wants to build liquefied nat-
ural gas terminals and make other en-
ergy investments to finally dial down 
Germany’s dependence on Russia. 
If our wary European friends are fi-
nally shaking off their slumber and 
getting serious, then certainly the 
United States of America can do the 
same. 
President Biden must lead the charge 
and lead it now. 
f 
ABORTION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on an entirely different matter, 
with a cascade of major crises testing 
our country, Senate Democrats are 
prioritizing a show vote on mandating 
9 months of abortion on demand across 
America. 
Senate Democrats want to go on 
record supporting the radical and mas-
sively unpopular proposition that we 
should have functionally no restric-
tions on abortion whatsoever. Demo-
crats already have the United States, 
one of just seven nations in the entire 
world that allows elective abortions 
after 20 weeks. This radical fringe pol-
icy places us in company like China 
and North Korea. 
But now, Senate Democrats want to 
go even further than Chairman Xi and 
Kim Jong-Un. Ninety-one percent of 
Americans support some restrictions 
on abortion during the third trimester. 
The public overwhelmingly disagrees 
with Democrats’ extreme obsession on 
this issue. 
But yet again, our colleagues wish to 
demonstrate that the radical left fringe 
runs today’s Democratic Party. 
As the world prays for Ukraine and 
debates consequences for Putin, as 
American families contend with vio-
lent crime, open borders, and runaway 
inflation, Washington Democrats want 
to spend their time arguing for unlim-
ited abortion on demand. 
So I want to thank the majority 
leader for making it so clear where his 
party’s priorities lie. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JAMES M. INHOFE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on yet another matter, last week, 
our distinguished colleague, the senior 
Senator from Oklahoma, the ranking 
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, announced he will retire from 
the Senate at the end of this Congress. 
By this autumn, Senator JIM INHOFE 
will have been a stalwart champion for 
Oklahomans and a hugely impactful 
Senator for 28 years. He has led crucial 
committees, shaped major legislation, 
and helped keep the needs and concerns 
of middle America at the forefront of 
this institution and its work. 
The fruits of JIM’s labors are appar-
ent across his beloved home State and 
our whole country. Most recently, atop 
the Armed Services Committee, he has 
been a remarkable advocate for fellow 
veterans, for today’s servicemembers, 
and for the needs of our national secu-
rity. 
We will have much more to say about 
Senator INHOFE’s storied service as we 
move through the remainder of this 
year and this Congress. But for now, I 
just want to congratulate our col-
league, his wife Kay, and their 20 kids 
and grandkids on a well-earned retire-
ment, to which they are now looking 
forward. 
And I am very glad to have the Sen-
ator’s wisdom and leadership to call 
upon for 10 more months, especially at 
a time such as this.

REMEMBERING RICHARD C. BLUM 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, on one final 
matter, I was saddened to hear this 
morning that Richard Blum, the hus-
band of my friend and colleague Sen-
ator FEINSTEIN, has passed away fol-
lowing his fight with cancer. 
For 30 years, Elaine and I have been 
privileged to cross paths with DIANNE 
and Dick in a number of ways, both 
professional and personal. It was al-
ways a great pleasure to break bread 
together, compare notes, and catch up. 
Our colleague’s very loving husband 
was, simply put, a fascinating person. 
He was highly successful, adventure-
some, brave, and curious. For years, he 
moved seamlessly between such things 
as creating major value in the highest 
ranks of the private sector and study-
ing Tibetan Buddhism. His passion for 
the Himalayas led him to befriend both 
the Dalai Lama and Sir Edmund Hil-
lary. I understand he even made his 
own attempt on Mount Everest. 
Dick’s appetites for adventure, for 
philanthropy, for civic engagement,

and business success all seemed to be

of projects that were both interesting 
and impacted his community for the

I know all Senators are grieving with 
and praying for our colleague Senator

Resumed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-

will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 139, 
H.R. 3755, a bill to protect a person’s ability 
to determine whether to continue or end a 
pregnancy, and to protect a health care pro-
vider’s ability to provide abortion services. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Illinois. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD C. BLUM 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
want to begin my remarks by joining 
Senator MCCONNELL in expressing my 
condolences to our friend and colleague 
Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN on the pass-
ing of her husband and partner Richard 
Blum. 
Dick Blum was a trailblazer in the 
Senate family, one of the first men to 
join the Senate Spouses club. He was 
proud of Senator FEINSTEIN’s historic 
career in public service. 
He was a success at business and in-
vested his wealth in easing human suf-
fering—from the streets of San Fran-
cisco to some of the poorest corners of 
the globe. He founded the American Hi-
malayan Foundation to assist the peo-
ple of the Himalayas. He also founded 
the Blum Center for Developing Econo-
mies at UC Berkeley to help teach stu-
dents about microlending, social enter-
prise, and other ways for poor people in 
developing nations to lift themselves 
from poverty. 
A story in today’s Los Angeles Times 
contained an anecdote that captured 
well Dick’s good humor and generous 
spirit. 
He said that in all the conversations 
he had over the years with Buddhist 
friends in the Himalayas, no one had 
ever convinced him of the likelihood of 
reincarnation. Maybe that is why he 
worked so hard to achieve so much 
good in this one lifetime he was given. 
He did more to ease human suffering 
than others might do in a dozen life-
time opportunities. 
To Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN, their 
beloved daughters and grandchildren, 
and all who knew and loved him, Loret-
ta and I offer our condolences. 
Dick Blum’s friendship was a gift, 
and his memory will be a blessing. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Madam President, on another note, 
there was a historic announcement last 
Friday when President Joe Biden an-
nounced Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
as his choice to serve as Associate Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court. I am going 
to speak about her nomination at 
length tomorrow, but a few words now. 
She is an extraordinary person. To 
become 
the 
first 
African-American 
woman nominated to serve on the Su-
preme Court, you have to be the best— 
and she has proven throughout her life 
that she is. 
She was a clerk to the retiring Jus-
tice Stephen Breyer, whose seat she 
now aspires to. She worked in the prac-
tice of law in so many different aspects 
and then on three different occasions 
came before this U.S. Senate for ap-
proval, advise and consent. On all three 
occasions, she emerged with bipartisan 
support, and we certainly hope to see 
that revisited again. 
She has authored some 500 different 
opinions, so there will be no mystery 
about her jurisprudence or her judicial 
philosophy. She has also been a person 
who has come before our committee as 
recently as last year when she was ap-
proved by the committee in June to 
serve on the DC Circuit Court. 
I think she is an exceptional choice, 
and I want to make sure that the hear-
ing that is given to her is respectful, 
fair, and professional. I have reached 
out to Senator GRASSLEY, my friend 
and the ranking member on the com-
mittee, to work toward that goal, and 
I hope all members of the committee 
will join us. 
UKRAINE 
Madam President, on a separate 
topic, I just returned from the Munich 
Security Conference and a visit to our 
NATO allies in Poland and Lithuania. 
On the latter part of that trip, I was 
joined by Senator CHRIS COONS of Dela-
ware and Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN of 
New Hampshire. 
Many here in this Chamber have 
heard me talk about my connection 
with my mother’s birth in Lithuania 
and the fact that I have cared about 
that country in a special way ever 
since I have served in Congress. 
Life was bleak and oppressive for the 
Lithuanian people and all the others in 
Eastern Europe living under the boot 
heel of the Russian czar. Countries 
such as Poland, which saw such devas-
tation during World War II, found 
themselves suffering decades of com-
munist dictatorship following the war. 
So it was no surprise that when the So-
viet Union finally collapsed, these na-
tions were determined to join the com-
munity of democracies and NATO. In 
fact, the Baltic States of Lithuania, 
Latvia, and Estonia helped lead this 
historic path to freedom. 
I remember so many aspects of it. In 
the shivering cold winter of 1991, mil-
lions of people joined hands to form a 
human chain, connecting all three na-
tions in the Baltic area. They called for 
change. Then in January 1991, the Sovi-
ets sent their tanks into Lithuania and 
Latvia and other places. The net result 
was deadly. Those Soviet tanks killed 
13 innocent people, and hundreds were 
injured in Lithuania. What were they 
asking for? Freedom. A chance to vote 
for their own future. Well, soon, the 
Baltic States stepped out even further 
and courageously declared independ-
ence from the Soviet Union. They 
wanted to reclaim their freedom. 
I remember visiting Lithuania in 
those days, seeing sandbags stacked up 
outside the Parliament, which they 
called the Seimas, and schoolkids who 
were taking a break from class to come 
pray the Rosary in front of those barri-
cades, light a couple candles—basically 
to be there for their country at that 
moment of testing. 
If this sounds familiar with what we 
are hearing in Ukraine today, it is. 
Those earlier days of independence 
had many brave souls coming forward 
with nothing but determination. Their 
small ‘‘arsenal of freedom,’’ as they 
called it, which they brought me in the 
backdoor to show me, consisted of a 
broom closet with about 8 or 10 rifles in 
it. They were ready to stare down the 
Soviets if necessary. 
I was so honored on this trip recently 
to visit with one of the champions of 
the restoration of freedom and Lithua-
nia’s 
Vytautas 
Landsbergis. 
Dr. 
Landsbergis is a music professor and 
was a leader of their revolution back to 
freedom in Lithuania. At 95 years of 
age, he remains a fierce champion of 
democracy, as he was in those early 
days confronting the Soviets. 
I also met with former Lithuanian 
President Valdas Adamkus, who left 
Lithuania for Chicago as a teenager 
and returned decades later to serve two 
terms as President and shepherd his 
nation, Lithuania, into the European 
Union and NATO. 
I visited military bases in both Po-
land and Lithuania, where I met U.S. 
troops supporting the NATO mission to 
protect the young democracies from 
Russian aggression. Among the service-
members were several from my State 
of Illinois—from Latham, IL, which is 
near Decatur; Montgomery, IL, near 
Aurora; and Kankakee. They came and 
told stories of their service in the Reg-
ular Army and how they were now 
working in Lithuania to prepare their 
armies for any possible battles in the 
future. It has been a wonderful, strong 
relationship. 
In Poland, when you mention you are 
from Illinois, virtually every military 
officer says they have been our friends 
for a long time, and they have been be-
cause for over 20 years, the Illinois Na-
tional Guard has been a direct contact 
with the Polish military forces, mod-
ernizing them and preparing them for 
any challenges that might come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S820 
February 28, 2022 
Eastern European allies know the 
Russian threat far better than we do. 
Look at these maps of Russian troop 
movements in and around Ukraine and 
the borders of our NATO allies. As you 
can see here, Russia, Kyiv, Kharkiv, 
Mariupol, they are in the news vir-
tually on a constant basis. 
You can see those troop movements, 
hundreds of thousands of troops that 
are moving from the Russian front into 
Ukraine these days. With the Russian 
troops now flooding into Belarus in the 
area of the far corner here, they are es-
sentially taking over that country too. 
Nations on the other side—Poland 
you can see on that map—Poland, Lith-
uania, and Latvia understand that the 
threat today is very real for them. 
They share a 60-mile border that con-
nects 
the 
Russian 
territory 
of 
Kaliningrad with Belarus. And the 
Suwalki gap is one that they are very 
concerned about keeping peaceful. It is 
a real threat, and they worry that the 
Russians are going to take this oppor-
tunity in Ukraine to extend their 
forces into Poland and into Lithuania 
and into Latvia. 
Poland in particular is already gener-
ously hosting hundreds of thousands of 
Ukrainian refugees pouring across the 
border. It is an inspiration to me to see 
this country of Poland reach out to ac-
cept these Ukrainian refugees. The 
United States has to step into this pic-
ture with humanitarian assistance for 
Poland and all the other countries, 
Moldova, Romania, and others taking 
in Ukrainian refugees. We have to help 
them feed, clothe, and shelter these 
people during this period of invasion by 
the Russians. 
Russia is unleashing a brutal war of 
choice against a free nation that wants 
to choose its own path, the path of de-
mocracy, and the result is sickening. 
This shows what is going on in the 
subways in Ukrainian cities. People are 
bringing their children to escape the 
bombing that Putin is initiating above. 
We have many millions of people in 
that country in peril, and some are 
taking their kids and trying to escape 
to a safe place like Poland. 
There has been terrible destruction 
that has gone on there as well. We have 
seen it on television right in the—this 
lady was in front of her own home at 
the time a rocket attacked it on Feb-
ruary 25. 
This is a picture which I saw in this 
morning’s Washington Post. It is a 
most touching scene. You can barely 
see this father down here, covered in 
blood, bringing his daughter to this 
paramedic. The paramedic really tried 
to perform CPR on this little girl who 
was injured in the shelling by Putin 
and his troops. Unfortunately, she did 
not survive. That is the reality of what 
Vladimir Putin is doing today. The 
American people know it, and the 
strength and courage of the people in 
Ukraine resisting these advances is an 
example to the world. 
We are seeing demonstrations of sup-
port across all of the world, the people 
of Ukraine. The Eiffel Tower, Empire 
State Building—I have to move some of 
these charts around. This one was espe-
cially 
impressive, 
the 
Brandenburg 
Gate in Berlin. Look at the crowds sup-
porting the people of Ukraine. 
It isn’t lost on us because we have a 
wonderful Ukrainian community in 
Chicago. Here they are at the church 
on Chicago Avenue just this last week-
end, and they have been coming back 
on a regular basis. I was there on Fri-
day. I spoke to many of these same 
people about the situation which they 
are facing in Ukraine. They would 
come up to me afterwards and say they 
have been on the telephone with mem-
bers of their family who are frightened 
for their lives, didn’t know if they 
could survive this aggression by Vladi-
mir Putin. 
When you think about what he has 
done, sadly, he has failed on so many 
fronts. How could he get so many 
things so wrong? 
He has unified NATO and support for 
NATO in a way which was unimagi-
nable just a few years ago. NATO 
stands 
unified 
now 
in 
defense 
of 
Ukraine and in confronting the aggres-
sion of Vladimir Putin. 
He has also unified the European 
Union. Countries like Sweden and 
Switzerland, which famously have been 
neutral in most of these conflicts, are 
now openly supporting the European 
Union’s efforts to put pressure on 
Vladimir Putin—sanctions that will 
stop him from this aggression in 
Ukraine. 
He has certainly, in the process, de-
stroyed the reputation of his country 
as a reliable partner in the future. The 
Germans had entered into an agree-
ment for a gas pipeline. Many of us 
questioned it from the start, but that 
was their decision—Nord Stream 2, 
drawing natural gas from Russia into 
Germany. Well, that pipeline is closed 
down now. Chancellor Scholz has an-
nounced he is looking for other serv-
ices, such as LNG, to replace the gas 
resources which were supposed to be 
sent in from Russia for a long time to 
come. It is going to lead to our energy 
independence in Europe—independence 
certainly from the unpredictable and 
unimaginable Vladimir Putin. 
I remember not so many years ago— 
30 years, as a matter of fact—when 
countries like the Baltics and Poland 
were finally given an opportunity for 
freedom. There were extraordinary ex-
amples of courage in each of those 
countries. I was lucky to be there to 
witness some of it. But what we are 
seeing now today in Ukraine is excep-
tional. The military experts thought 
they would last a matter of hours. 
Now, it is days, and maybe it is weeks. 
I hope it is months and even longer be-
cause they have the courage to stand 
up. Ordinary citizens who are showing 
up at recruiting offices for homeland 
defense are being given Kalashnikovs 
and other weapons sent out to stop the 
Russians. You can see that they are in-
spiring the world, as they should. It is 
a reminder to all of us that Vladimir 
Putin and his brand of aggression has 
been seen so many times in history. 
Someone like him or Lukashenka in 
Belarus think they are so powerful 
that they are above accountability, but 
that is not the case. We have got to 
make certain, as we go forward, that 
we stand with the people of Ukraine; 
that they know we are their friends; 
that we aspire to the same values. 
And I want to thank President Biden 
for his leadership. I am going to be 
calling on him with many others. The 
first thing that I am going to do is send 
a letter, which will be headed out this 
evening, signed by colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle. What we are asking 
the President to do—and it is within 
his authority—is to grant temporary 
protected status to Ukrainians now on 
visas in the United States. Some of 
them are tourists; some of them are 
students; and some are on work visas, 
but oftentimes, those visas expire, and 
they are supposed to return home to 
their own countries at the moment of 
expiration. If there are circumstances 
in those home countries, the President 
has the authority to give temporary 
protected status to allow them to stay 
in the United States. 
The Senators who are joining me in 
this letter will ask President Biden to 
extend temporary protected status to 
the people of Ukraine who are on visas 
in the United States and are present in 
our country. That, to me, is a way to 
give him them some peace of mind. We 
certainly wouldn’t want them to re-
turn to that war scene that we have 
seen over and over broadcast on tele-
vision. 
And there is more to do, whether it is 
humanitarian assistance in countries 
like Poland or where it is lethal aid to 
help the insurgents in Ukraine defend 
their country, the United States needs 
to be there. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
H.R. 3755 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, this 
evening, the U.S. Senate will be voting 
on the most extreme legislation on 
abortion ever considered in the history 
of this body. The deceptively named 
‘‘Women’s Health Protection Act’’ is 
more accurately called the ‘‘Abortion 
on Demand Until Birth Act.’’ No won-
der it is being held on a Monday, as we 
call these the flyback votes, in the 
midst of this crisis in Ukraine—that it 
be tonight that they want to slip in 
this vote, the most extreme abortion 
vote ever—ever—considered in the his-
tory of this body. 
This bill would force every single 
State to be a late-term abortion State. 
This bill allows abortion up until the 
very moment of birth itself. That is 
simply infanticide. 
This legislation goes beyond codi-
fying the wrongly decided Roe v. Wade 
case and would ban many lifesaving 
State laws currently in effect that 
limit abortion and enjoy the broad sup-
port from Americans, I might add.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S821 
February 28, 2022 
When our Founding Fathers laid out 
the founding principles of America in 
the Declaration of Independence, they 
talked about life; they talked about 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
The bottom line is, you can’t have lib-
erty and you can’t have happiness, or 
even the pursuit of it, without first 
having that inalienable right given by 
God, and that is the right to life. 
The ‘‘Abortion on Demand Until 
Birth Act’’ would impose a horrifying 
abortion regime across the land that 
violates the right to life and is com-
pletely contrary to the kind of Nation 
America is and aspires to be. 
In this bill’s America, every State, 
despite the voices of its own citizens, 
would become New York or California, 
where abortion is celebrated and un-
born children are denied the most basic 
human rights. In this bill’s America, a 
pregnant mother could elect to have a 
birth-day abortion for a full-term, 8- 
pound baby on the day of the baby’s 
due date. In this bill’s America, late- 
term abortions could be committed on 
demand through brutal dismember-
ment procedures in which the unborn 
child bleeds and feels excruciating pain 
as she dies from being pulled apart, 
limb from limb. 
In this bill’s America, an unborn 
baby could be cruelly targeted for abor-
tion because the parents learned she 
was a girl or that she might have Down 
syndrome. In this bill’s America, par-
ents would not know or have any say 
over whether their young daughter has 
a life-altering abortion. In this bill’s 
America, vulnerable women and girls 
could receive dangerous, do-it-yourself 
chemical abortion drugs by mail with-
out ever seeing a doctor in person. 
In 
this 
bill’s 
America, 
pregnant 
mothers would be denied the oppor-
tunity to see the ultrasounds of their 
babies. In this bill’s America, a doctor 
or a nurse who doesn’t want to perform 
an abortion could be forced to do so in 
violation of his or her deeply held 
moral or religious beliefs. That is spe-
cifically struck out in this bill—the re-
ligious exemption. 
In this bill’s America we would be 
only one of seven countries—seven—in-
cluding brutal regimes like North 
Korea and China, that would allow 
abortion-on-demand after 5 months of 
pregnancy. 
In this bill’s America, a baby bald 
eagle or a baby sea turtle still in its 
eggshell would be protected under Fed-
eral law while an unborn child at any 
stage of pregnancy could be brutally 
killed with no repercussions for the 
abortionists. In a nutshell, this radical 
bill would make the United States of 
America one of the most dangerous 
places in the world to be an unborn 
child. 
According to a Marist poll just last 
month, the overwhelming majority of 
Americans reject abortion-on-demand 
up to birth and especially its imposi-
tion by the Federal Government on the 
States—71 percent of Americans, in-
cluding 70 percent of Independents and 
49 percent of Democrats, want abortion 
to be limited, at most, to the first 3 
months of pregnancy. 
Sixty-one percent of Americans say 
abortion should either be illegal or the 
policy decision should be up to the 
States. Rather than listen to the 
American people—who don’t want late- 
term abortion or a Federal abortion 
mandate—the ‘‘Abortion on Demand 
Until Birth Act’’ would enshrine in 
Federal law the most far-reaching 
goals of the predatory abortion indus-
try. 
We are just a few weeks or months 
away from a pivotal point in our Na-
tion’s history. I pray in the Dobbs Mis-
sissippi late-term abortion case that 
we will see the Supreme Court right a 
historic injustice and overturn Roe v. 
Wade. This will return the power to 
protect unborn children to the people’s 
representatives at the State and the 
Federal levels, to modernize our laws 
to catch up with great advances in 
science, technology, and medicine that 
indisputably show the humanity of a 
child in the womb. 
I would challenge anybody listening 
to these remarks tonight to take their 
smartphone 
and 
Google 
‘‘15-week 
baby’’ or ‘‘20-week baby’’ and press on 
‘‘Images’’ and look at that image. 
Instead, the ‘‘Abortion on Demand 
Until Birth Act’’ ignores the science 
entirely and would erase unborn chil-
dren and even the most modest protec-
tions of their right to life in the laws of 
every single State. It is completely in-
defensible. It is extreme. It is an egre-
gious violation of the most funda-
mental of all human rights, and that is 
the right to life. 
I pray and I urge my colleagues to re-
ject this horrific, barbaric, extreme 
legislation that the Senate will vote on 
here in the next couple of hours and 
take a stand for defending the most 
vulnerable among us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, a 
week ago, the Senate went on a short 
1-week recess back in our State. It was 
already scheduled for us to be in our 
State getting a chance to be able to 
just interact with people at home. It 
was a good week to be able to interact 
with a lot of people back home for me 
personally. But we all watched as we 
were scattered around the country in 
the past week, Russia rolled tanks into 
Ukraine. And we watched in horror as 
Russian aircraft flew over Ukrainian 
cities, as they fired their missiles into 
Ukrainian apartment complexes, as 
they have slaughtered their neighbors 
because Putin wanted their land and to 
dominate the region. 
All of us, as we got back together 
this week, were ready to be able to 
speak to the issues with Ukraine, ready 
to be able to stand with the people of 
Ukraine, ready to be able to talk about 
the sanctions and what was going to 
happen and how we were going to actu-
ally respond to the Russians murdering 
their neighbors and a dictator thug 
trying to dominate the region. 
But instead of that, my Democratic 
colleagues decided not to talk about 
Ukraine when we got back together, 
but instead they want to talk about ex-
panding abortion in America. 
How incredibly tone-deaf is that? 
The whole world is talking about 
Ukraine and the repression they are ex-
periencing, and the U.S. Senate is talk-
ing about how do we get more abor-
tions in America? That is what we are 
going to vote on? That is what we are 
going to debate, is how do we increase 
abortions in America when the world 
sees what is happening in Ukraine? 
What in the world? How tone-deaf 
can we be? 
This body should be the place we are 
actually debating the biggest issues of 
the day, and, apparently, to my Demo-
cratic colleagues, the biggest issue of 
the day is how many more abortions 
can we give in America because that 
seems to be bigger than Ukraine, big-
ger than 7.5 percent inflation, bigger 
than $30 trillion in debt, bigger than 
anything. The most important thing is, 
how can we take the life of more chil-
dren? 
What has this body become when 
there is an obsession with abortion? 
This is the most pro-abortion President 
this country has ever had and the most 
pro-abortion Democratic Party our 
country has ever seen. 
It is now impermissible to be a Dem-
ocrat and to support the life of chil-
dren. You are pushed out of the party. 
And it has moved from where it used to 
be that the vast majority of Democrats 
were pro-life Democrats. Then it was 
fewer and fewer and fewer. And now it 
has moved from you can’t just not be 
pro-life, now you have to actually be 
pro-abortion—well beyond pro-choice. 
Now you have to find ways to increase 
abortions in America to be accepted in 
the party. 
This is not where America is. 
The bill that is being brought to the 
floor in just minutes from now—in the 
middle of a war in Ukraine—is not 
about protecting Ukrainians. It is not 
even about protecting children in our 
country. It is about destroying chil-
dren in our country. 
This bill is being advertised as we are 
just going to codify Roe. It is not just 
going to codify Roe. This is talking 
about stripping away every protection 
from every child in the womb from any 
State in the country. 
This particular bill prohibits paren-
tal notification. If a child wants to get 
an abortion, this bill says to the par-
ents: You don’t get to know if your 
child is having an abortion. 
By the way, name another medical 
procedure that the parents are not al-
lowed to be able to know about for 
their own child. 
This takes away waiting periods. It 
takes away health and safety standards 
for abortion clinics. Abortion clinics in 
every State can’t have health and safe-
ty standards because, for those clinics

that take the lives of children, we 
don’t care what they look like or about 
the health and safety standards of 
them. 
It takes away ultrasound require-
ments. This bill literally says to ex-
pectant moms: You don’t need to know 
what is going on in your body. We will 
just take care of it for you. 
So no State is allowed to be able to 
inform a mom of what is actually hap-
pening in her own body because the 
goal of this is not getting information 
to moms; the goal of this is to increase 
abortions because all that happens 
with an ultrasound is the giving of in-
formation to the mom and letting her 
choose. Oh, no. That is not acceptable 
because she may choose life, and this 
bill is determined to increase the num-
ber of abortions in America. 
I remember a time when my Demo-
crats used to talk about safe, legal, and 
rare. Now, they just want it safe, legal, 
and common. What have we become? 
This bill is the ‘‘1 Minute from Infan-
ticide’’ bill. It mandates abortion in 
every State up to the moment of birth. 
That is North Korea. That is China. It 
is not the United States of America ex-
cept for this Senate. They want to be 
more like North Korea and China, ap-
parently, and to be able to follow their 
great humanitarian example and be a 
nation that takes the lives of children 
rather than protects each child as pre-
cious. 
They look in the womb and see a 
business model. I look in the womb and 
see 10 fingers and 10 toes and a beating 
heart and a functioning nervous sys-
tem and DNA that is different than the 
mom’s or the dad’s DNA. In every defi-
nition of science, that is a unique per-
son and a unique child, but it only 
seems to be a nuisance to some. I don’t 
think children are a nuisance; I think 
children are precious. 
On a day when we should be talking 
and debating about protecting life in 
Ukraine, this body, instead, and my 
Democratic colleagues don’t want to 
talk about Ukraine; they just want to 
talk about abortion—again. It is heart-
breaking that that is where we are. 
It is also heartbreaking that this 
body has become this focused when the 
rest of the country is saying: How can 
we add limits to abortion? 
The latest poll reads that 71 percent 
of Americans want at least some re-
strictions on abortion, but, oh, no, not 
in this body. Apparently, there are peo-
ple who disagree with the American 
people, and they say: No limits—any 
moment, any time, any child. 
I don’t believe a single person in this 
Chamber should vote for this bill, not 
only because of what it does to the 
States but because of what it does to 
just decent people. If you are an indi-
vidual, working in a hospital today 
who, when you were hired, said, ‘‘I 
went into the medical profession to 
save life, not take it,’’ and when you 
were hired as a nurse or as a doctor, 
you said, ‘‘I don’t want to perform 
abortions,’’ that is allowed right now 
under law. It wouldn’t be under this. If 
you go into the medical profession, you 
will perform abortions when the Demo-
crats in DC tell you to perform abor-
tions, because they want more. 
Conscience protections are taken 
away in this bill. People of conscience, 
people of faith, who say ‘‘I don’t want 
to take the lives of children’’ will be 
required or they will lose their jobs. 
Oh. By the way, if you try to slow 
someone down from getting an abor-
tion, this bill actually gives someone 
the right to sue you if you try to limit 
them from having an abortion. 
This is, by far, the most extreme pro- 
abortion bill that has ever been put in 
front of Congress—ever. It was done 
when we should have been debating 
Ukraine, but Ukraine is not impor-
tant—abortion is. So my Democratic 
colleagues did this instead, today, as 
the callback vote in their response to 
Putin’s aggression. Well, I disagree. I 
disagree. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
at a time when Vladimir Putin is kill-
ing Ukrainians, my Democratic col-
leagues want to kill more unborn 
American children for any reason up 
until the moment the baby takes its 
first breath—up until the moment the 
baby takes its first breath. Indeed, this 
bill should be called the ‘‘Abortion on 
Demand Until Birth Act.’’ 
This is the most egregious, horrific 
attack on the lives of unborn children 
and the health of moms in American 
history. In fact, if my Democratic col-
leagues had their way, this baby whom 
I delivered years ago could have been 
murdered—aborted—the moment prior 
to this cesarean section. 
Listen, just for a moment, to what 
this bill would do. 
No. 1, it goes far and beyond Roe v. 
Wade by invalidating State laws that 
protect the unborn child and the health 
and the well-being of moms. It would 
likely lead to taxpayer-funded abor-
tions at home and abroad. 
It would tie up faith-based hospitals 
in courts for their not offering abortion 
services. 
This bill fully blows open the door to 
sex-based abortions. 
It eliminates the requirement for in-
formed consent or parental consent. 
It eliminates conscience protections. 
I can tell you, as a physician myself, I 
wouldn’t be surprised if half of the 
medical students in the Nation and 
half of the nursing students in the Na-
tion would quit medical school or nurs-
ing school if they were going to be 
forced into participating in abortions. 
This bill has a total disregard for 
women’s health. Instead of the stand-
ards of a surgery center, this bill would 
allow for these services to be offered in 
a garage or in a backroom apartment. 
The bill provides the right to provide 
abortions by any healthcare provider. 
No longer would it take a physician to 
do abortions. It would allow nurse mid-
wives, nurse practitioners, and physi-
cian assistants to do abortions. 
I had to take care of women who had 
gone through miscarriages at every 
gestational age. This is not a job for a 
nurse midwife, a physician assistant, a 
nurse practitioner. Before we would let 
residents take care of this type of a 
miscarriage, they would have gone 
through 4 years of medical school, and 
they would have been, most likely, in 
their second or third year of training 
before we would have entrusted them 
with this type of procedure. Again, for 
a woman who has had a miscarriage, 
the risks of infection, of hemorrhage, 
and creating infertility are too great. 
This bill would allow States to go un-
restricted as to any type of telehealth 
abortions—abortion by phone. In my 
opinion, it is malpractice to prescribe 
such a medicine without examining the 
patient, seeing how big the uterus is, 
seeing what the size of the baby is. 
This procedure is wrought with com-
plications. I am the person who had to 
take care of those complications. Wich-
ita, KS, was home to one of the biggest 
abortion clinics in the country, and 
just 2 hours down the road was Great 
Bend. Time after time, patients would 
show up in our emergency room with 
complications from the procedure or 
this pill. 
I 
never—I 
never, 
ever—imagined, 
when I would come to the Senate, that 
I would be fighting harder on the Sen-
ate floor to save the lives of moms and 
babies than I did in the emergency 
room and the delivery room. 
Before I close, I want to say a heart-
felt thanks to all of the pro-life advo-
cates across the country who have 
worked so hard, especially those folks 
who are part of Kansans for Life and 
all the pro-life advocates in Kansas 
who have worked so hard to pass pre-
vious legislation to protect the lives of 
moms and unborn babies that this bill 
would wipe out with one swoop. I am so 
proud of the Kansans for Life and their 
advocacy of the Value Them Both 
amendment—again, protecting the life 
of the mom and the baby. 
Our work is not done yet. We can’t 
let up. We have more work to do. I can 
promise you I have only just begun to 
fight to protect the lives of unborn ba-
bies and to protect the health and well- 
being of mothers. 
I urge my colleagues tonight to vote 
no on this most extreme anti-life legis-
lation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. SMITH. Madam President, I rise 
in support of the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act. 
I am here today because I believe, as 
do most in this country, that people 
should have the freedom to receive the 
reproductive healthcare they need, in-
cluding abortion. The Women’s Health 
Protection Act would protect that free-
dom. 
Now, I am the only Senator in this 
body who has ever worked for Planned

Parenthood. I learned firsthand in that 
job that, if people don’t control their 
reproductive lives, they don’t control 
anything in their lives. Working at 
Planned Parenthood in Minnesota was 
an honor, and I had the opportunity to 
hear the stories of patients, each with 
individual, unique, personal reasons for 
receiving an abortion. This is still the 
case for the patients who visit all of 
these clinics today. 
Here is one story about a woman 
named Liz from Edina, MN. 
At Liz’s 18th-week ultrasound ap-
pointment, Liz’s doctor told her that 
her pregnancy was incompatible with 
life. She would either miscarry or the 
baby would die moments after birth. 
Because of this diagnosis, Liz decided 
to have an abortion. It was an agoniz-
ing experience for her, but she was able 
to make the decision on her own terms. 
Another story I want to share today 
comes 
from 
a 
patient 
from 
Min-
neapolis. 
At the age of 20, they were in an abu-
sive relationship and found themselves 
7 
weeks 
pregnant. 
They 
went 
to 
Planned Parenthood for their abortion, 
and that abortion helped them to break 
from their affiliation with their abuser. 
They eventually got back on their feet, 
and they could pursue their dream of 
going to law school and starting a mar-
keting firm and having a family with 
somebody who they loved. 
These are the stories of people facing 
one of the most important decisions we 
humans will ever make: whether to be-
come a parent. They were able to make 
these decisions freely and for them-
selves. We should all have this free-
dom. We should all be able to make 
these decisions for ourselves, free from 
politicians and judges looking over our 
shoulders and deciding for us. A major-
ity of Americans agree with this. They 
agree that abortion should be legal, 
and they understand that reproductive 
healthcare, 
including 
abortion, 
is 
healthcare. 
Yet, today, the reproductive rights of 
women in this country are at their 
greatest risk since Roe v. Wade was de-
cided decades ago, and it is no mystery 
as to how we got here. What is hap-
pening today is the culmination of a 
nearly 40-year effort by conservatives 
in the Republican Party to radically 
remake the courts. It is 2022, and that 
moment is here. The Supreme Court 
seems poised to overturn Roe, and if 
that happens, half the States in this 
country will ban abortion entirely— 
half the States. 
In 
anticipation 
of 
this 
moment, 
rightwing Republican State legisla-
tures have been working to pass laws 
that will gut women’s healthcare and 
severely restrict our freedom. What 
this means is that women’s freedom 
and autonomy over our own bodies— 
our right to reproductive healthcare, 
the healthcare that we need—will basi-
cally depend on who we are and where 
we live. Make no mistake. Abortion 
care will always—it will always—be 
available to women who have money. It 
will be poor women and women of color 
who will lose this right. 
This is why the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act is so important. We need to 
listen to the voices of the majority of 
Americans who agree: Women deserve 
the freedom and the dignity to make 
their own decisions about their own 
bodies and their own lives. But the re-
ality is, we can no longer rely on the 
courts to protect this right. That is 
why we need to pass the Women’s 
Health Protection Act. 
In a few minutes, we will vote on this 
bill, which would protect the right to 
abortion in every State. It would ad-
vance racial justice. It would limit the 
structural barriers to accessing abor-
tion care and protect everybody’s free-
dom to make the best decisions for 
themselves, for their health, for their 
families, and for their futures. 
Colleagues, I urge you to vote to pass 
the Women’s Health Protection Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
‘‘SIX TRIPLE EIGHT’’ CONGRESSIONAL GOLD 
MEDAL ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise 
this afternoon to celebrate the passage 
of the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act. This bill honors 
the women of the only all-Black, all-fe-
male unit to serve overseas during 
World War II as part of the 6888th Cen-
tral Postal Directory Battalion. 
Passage of this legislation is long 
overdue and will award the Congres-
sional Gold Medal to these brave 
women of the Six Triple Eight for their 
devotion to duty, military service, and 
their extraordinary efforts to boost the 
morale of personnel stationed in Eu-
rope during World War II. 
Today, it is easy to connect with our 
loved ones through text, emails, or so-
cial media. Communication is more 
convenient, and consequently, many of 
us take the ease of that communica-
tion for granted. But during World War 
II, the only connection people like my 
mom and dad had while my father was 
deployed in Europe was our mail sys-
tem. The mail delivered love and inspi-
ration to our troops huddled in fox-
holes and fighting for our freedom. The 
mail kept them going through the dark 
and troubled times of World War II. 
The mail anchored our troops and con-
nected them to home. 
The women of the Six Triple Eight 
delivered the mail although the deck 
was stacked against them from the 
start. While crossing the Atlantic to 
Europe, the troop convoy carrying the 
Six Triple Eight encountered German 
U-boats, forcing the convoy to take de-
fensive actions and change course. 
Shortly after their arrival in the Euro-
pean theater, a German V1 dove at 
them, forcing them to take cover out 
of fear of being bombed. 
Physical dangers aside, the women of 
the Six Triple Eight faced sexism and 
racism. In Birmingham, England, the 
very same soldiers the Six Triple Eight 
were committed to helping spread vial 
rumors just because they were Black 
women. 
On top of the physical dangers and 
the social injustice they faced were the 
challenges of the mail mission itself. 
Handling and sorting the mail was no 
easy task. The Six Triple Eight found 
warehouses crammed from floor to 
ceiling with mail whose delivery was 
long, long overdue, sometimes over 
years. They found giant rats tearing 
apart the undelivered Christmas care 
packages. There was little, if any, or-
ganization. They had to sort this mail 
in 
poor 
working 
conditions—ware-
houses that were poorly lit, damp, and 
without heat. 
Undeterred, the women of the Six 
Triple Eight rolled up their sleeves and 
dug in. Fixing the mail backlog was es-
timated to take at least 6 months, pos-
sibly even a year. The Six Triple Eight 
organized the millions of letters and 
packages in just 3 months. They firmly 
believed in the motto ‘‘no mail, low 
morale.’’ 
Their diligence, their commitment to 
excellence, dignity, and class, and their 
relentless drive to get the mail into the 
hands of the troops won them admira-
tion throughout the European theater. 
Their actions boosted the spirits of 
thousands of soldiers like my dad by 
reconnecting them with their family 
and friends back home and giving them 
a renewed vigor to fight. 
I want to thank Representative GWEN 
MOORE
and 
Representative 
JAKE 
LATURNER for leading this effort in the 
House, and I want to thank my col-
leagues in both the House and Senate 
who have supported this bill and made 
awarding the Congressional Gold Medal 
to these brave women possible. There 
were lots of challenges: Black women 
serving in the military—only ones 
seemingly willing to volunteer to go to 
Europe to meet the needs of those who 
serve. 
I would also like to thank COL Edna 
Cummings for her dedication to make 
certain the stories of the Six Triple 
Eight are remembered and honored. 
In 2018, I was at Fort Leavenworth in 
Kansas to dedicate the Six Triple Eight 
monument. I was honored to meet 
these women and was inspired to make 
certain more Americans knew of their 
incredible service during World War II. 
Of the over 300 members of the Six 
Triple Eight, I would like to recognize 
and thank the surviving members and 
make sure their names are included in 
the 
CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD: 
Hilda 
Griggs, Anna Robertson, Romay Davis, 
Cresencia 
Garcia, 
Fannie 
Griffin 
McClendon, and Lena Kings. 
The Six Triple Eight served our coun-
try selflessly and were a crucial asset 
in the war effort. This is one more way 
our Nation can say to these incredible 
women: Thank you for your service. We 
respect you, and we love you. 
It is my honor to celebrate the pas-
sage of this bill today.

invasion of Ukraine. Putin—I condemn 
him, and he is even being condemned 
by his own people in Russia and a 
growing alliance around the world. 
There is nothing that justifies Russia 
invading Ukraine. This is the most sig-
nificant intrusion from one country 
into another since the beginning of the 
1930s in what resulted in World War II. 
I pray for the safety of the Ukrainian 
people 
and 
a 
rapid 
end 
to 
this 
unprovoked war. 
As we hear stories about their brav-
ery and resolve, I am inspired by their 
dedication to defend their freedom. The 
United States is making it clear we 
stand with and support them. 
This war is a terrible tragedy, but it 
is also a wake-up call for the United 
States of America. When it comes to 
defense spending, energy production, 
and humanitarian assistance, our com-
mitments to these issues demonstrate 
our commitment to global security. 
We must recognize that we have ad-
versaries who seek to use force to re-
cover claimed territory, possess weap-
ons of mass destruction, and otherwise 
destabilize our country and our allies 
and partners. For those of us in Con-
gress, to ignore these threats would be 
derelict in our duty to preserve Amer-
ican security and prosperity. We would 
be derelict to the people of the United 
States of America. 
This recognition begins with a strong 
national defense. It is unacceptable 
that we have failed to pass appropria-
tions for the Pentagon, State Depart-
ment, and other national security 
Agencies essential to protecting and 
projecting our strength abroad. As a 
result, new programs necessary to 
meeting the challenges in the years to 
come are stuck in limbo. 
In classified briefings for the Appro-
priations Committee, we have heard 
about the advances the militaries of 
our adversaries are making, and it is 
alarming. 
For 6 months, Congress has imposed 
a spending freeze while other countries 
press ahead. When the latest con-
tinuing resolution expires in 10 days, 
we need an agreement on this spending, 
and we should not allow and we cannot 
afford another delay. 
As we prepare to receive President 
Biden’s budget for the coming fiscal 
year, it will be important that his top- 
line figure for our Nation’s defenses ex-
ceed inflation. MacKenzie Eaglen at 
the 
American 
Enterprise 
Institute 
writes that $2 to $4 billion is being lost 
per month to cover inflationary costs, 
reducing the buying power of our mili-
tary. President Biden must take this 
into account. 
He famously said: ‘‘Show me your 
budget, and I’ll tell you what you 
value.’’ When it comes to our national 
spending, our enemies are watching 
also. Our values extend to our concern 
for the people impacted by this war. 
Russia’s war with Ukraine is already a 
humanitarian calamity. Children have 
been killed and wounded and families 
split apart as some flee and some loved 
ones stay. As of today, this conflict has 
created more than 400,000 refugees, and 
the U.N. predicts that number can 
climb to 5 million. 
I commend our European allies for 
their response in welcoming refugees, 
and I expect our own Nation will be 
generous with financial support for 
those seeking safety. But this war will 
have a humanitarian consequence that 
goes beyond those directly impacted by 
the fighting. 
Ukraine and Russia account for more 
than one-quarter of the world’s wheat 
production. It is impossible to believe 
that such production won’t be im-
pacted by the fighting and sanctions, 
especially as we have seen their ports 
close. This will make food shortages 
around the world more severe. No gov-
ernment in the world is as generous 
with its resources for international 
food assistance as the United States, 
but I again point out the excess pro-
duction of our American farmers that 
can be shared. There really is no excess 
production; the need is so great, what-
ever we produce will feed people. Our 
government 
should 
utilize 
the 
re-
sources of its farmers and promote sta-
bility where hungry societies are frag-
ile. 
Russia’s aggression must also be a 
wake-up call to our dependence on for-
eign oil. Prior to the invasion, the 
United States was directly paying Rus-
sia, our third largest supplier of oil, 
around $70 million per day for oil and 
refined products, or over 700,000 barrels 
of petroleum products per day. We are 
financing with our oil purchases the 
ability of Russia to do harm around the 
world. 
Combined with our European allies, 
who are even more dependent on Rus-
sian energy, Putin’s profit before the 
invasion was $330 million each day. We 
are subsidizing aggression in Moscow, 
and it extends to the Middle East as 
well. This must end. 
I believe in an ‘‘all of the above’’ ap-
proach to energy production, and our 
oil and gas producers must play a role. 
The Biden administration should rein-
state the Keystone XL Pipeline and 
promote commonsense solutions that 
boost jobs at home and keep money out 
of the pockets of our adversaries. It 
also would be helpful in our battle 
against inflation here in the United 
States. 
Each of these challenges can be met 
if we in the Senate are unified in pur-
pose. The American people and the 
world view this body as divided, unable 
to come together on many important 
issues. I don’t believe it has to be that 
way. I certainly stand willing and able 
to work with my colleagues to find 
common ground as we respond to this 
invasion. 
We know lots of examples we can 
point to where we do work together 
and pass critical legislation. We must 
find 
compromise 
and 
immediately 
move on sanctions legislation. We must 
pass defense appropriations. We must 
focus on an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy 
strategy to address our dependence 
upon foreign oil. We have done it be-
fore, and we can do it again. 
Winston Churchill—in my view, the 
most inspiring leader of the 20th cen-
tury—I thought of him as I watched 
Ukraine’s own inspirational President 
and the response of his people. I share 
today a quote from Churchill that 
meets the occasion: 
Very few wars have been won by mere 
numbers alone. Quality, will power, geo-
graphical advantages . . . the command of 
the sea, and, above all, a cause which rouses 
the spontaneous surgings of the human spirit 
in millions of hearts—these have proved to 
be the divisive factors in the human story. 
Americans—Americans 
of 
all 
stripes—share that human spirit with 
Ukrainians today. 
I ask God to bless Ukraine and its 
people, and God bless the United States 
of America as we do our part to sup-
port their people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
following Senators be permitted to 
speak prior to the scheduled vote: My-
self for up to 5 minutes, Senator MUR-
RAY for up to 5 minutes, and Senator 
SCHUMER up to 3 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 3755 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, we will be voting in just a few 
minutes on the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act, which I have proudly spon-
sored, first introduced in 2013. I want to 
thank particularly Senator SCHUMER 
for his leadership and Senator MURRAY 
for enabling us to have this historic 
vote. It is historic, the first vote that 
we will take guaranteeing the right of 
a provider to provide abortion care, 
which is healthcare, and the right of a 
patient to receive that care. There are 
very few votes that we will take in the 
U.S. Senate in the course of our career 
that will have as profound and dra-
matic an impact on the lives of all 
Americans. 
Yes, reproductive healthcare is wom-
en’s healthcare by and large, but it is 
human healthcare. Women’s rights are 
human rights. And the decisions that 
women make about when and whether 
to become pregnant are intensely per-
sonal. They should not be interfered 
with by any of us, anyone from the 
government, anyone else. That right is 
protected by the Constitution. Today’s 
vote comes at a time of unparalleled 
attack on equal access to abortion care 
in this country. 
I clerked for Justice Harry Blackmun 
on the U.S. Supreme Court in the term 
after he wrote the majority opinion in 
Roe v. Wade. And at that time, we all 
believed that the decision would put an 
end to this controversy, this debate, 
once and for all. And yet here we are, 
five decades later; what was then un-
thinkable now has happened. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has volun-
tarily taken a case that calls into ques-
tion a woman’s right to choose. And

S825 
February 28, 2022 
the U.S. Supreme Court seems to be on 
track, based on its refusal to stop im-
plementation of the Texas 5-week ban 
on abortion, to overturning Roe v. 
Wade. 
Now, the U.S. Supreme Court will 
never say that ‘‘we hereby overturn 
Roe v. Wade.’’ This majority, influ-
enced by rightwing ideology, will, in 
effect, overturn it without saying so 
because across the street in Dobbs v. 
Jackson Women’s Healthcare Organiza-
tion, the question of whether Mis-
sissippi’s ban on abortion after 15 
weeks is constitutional is squarely be-
fore the Court. And, make no mistake, 
if the Court upholds that Mississippi 
law, Roe v. Wade will no longer be the 
law of the land. Planned Parenthood v. 
Casey will no longer be the law of the 
land. Fifty years of jurisprudence will 
be gone without ever telling us that 
Roe is overturned. The Court will move 
that goalpost, and Roe will fall. And at 
least 20 States, through trigger laws, 
are prepared to immediately prohibit 
abortion completely and entirely. 
If you don’t understand this threat, 
just ask the women of Texas. They are 
currently living in a State without pro-
tections of Roe. That dangerous anti- 
abortion law, SB 8, contains a 6-week 
abortion 
ban—6 
weeks—far 
before 
many women even know that they are 
pregnant. And even worse, the law’s di-
visive bounty hunter provision depu-
tizes a woman’s neighbors, friends, 
family, and acquaintances. 
Last year alone, 19 States enacted 106 
restrictions, 
including 
12 
abortion 
bans. For the first time ever, States 
enacted more than 100 abortion restric-
tions in a single year. My bill—the 
Women’s Health Protection Act—would 
put an end to this relentless and ever- 
growing attack on reproductive rights. 
It would create a Federal statutory 
right for healthcare providers to pro-
vide abortion care. It would provide a 
right for patients to receive that care, 
free from medically unnecessary re-
strictions that single out and impede 
abortion access. 
Let’s not forget for one moment the 
reality on the ground. The reality is 
for millions of Americans, their fu-
tures—in some cases, their lives—de-
pend on accessible abortion care. And 
the implications and ramifications af-
fect men as well as women, families as 
well as moms. 
We have had enough meddling by 
politicians and politically motivated 
judges getting between Americans and 
their personal healthcare decision. We 
have had enough with the shameful as-
saults on people’s freedoms and fu-
tures. We can’t go back, and we need 
this action now. It is time. It is time to 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
UKRAINE 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
want to first briefly address what is 
happening in Ukraine. The Ukrainian 
people are being plunged into a deadly 
and devastating war. We are already 
seeing hundreds of thousands of refu-
gees fleeing the destruction and leav-
ing their lives behind. We have seen 
heartbreaking 
images 
of 
children 
huddled in basements—all of this trag-
edy for no other reason than the cruel 
ambition of one dictator. 
Make no mistake, every life lost, 
every community torn apart, the fault 
for this conflict lies solely at the feet 
of Vladimir Putin. 
I strongly support continued efforts 
to inflict severe sanctions on Russia 
for this unjustified war of aggression. 
Russia must pay a crushing price for 
invading 
a 
sovereign 
democracy 
unprovoked. This is a time for our 
country and the world to remain 
united in strong support of Ukraine 
and firmly against Putin. 
So today I am thinking of my con-
stituents with friends and family and 
loved ones in Ukraine, and my heart is 
with the Ukrainian people who only 
want peace. I want them to know I will 
continue to do everything in my power 
to make sure the United States is 
doing 
its 
utmost 
to 
support 
the 
Ukrainian people. 
H.R. 3755 
Now, Madam President, I want to ad-
dress the vote we are about to take. 
And I will start with a few simple ques-
tions for my colleagues: Do you trust 
women? Do you trust patients? Do you 
trust doctors? Do you believe every 
American should be able to make deep-
ly personal decisions about pregnancy 
and parenting according to their own 
beliefs without the government inter-
fering? 
Well, if you answer yes to those ques-
tions, then your job tonight is pretty 
easy, vote for the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act. What this bill does is sim-
ple. It follows the Constitution in near-
ly a half a century of precedent and 
gives patients the right to get an abor-
tion and doctors the right to provide 
abortion care no matter where in 
America that patient or that doctor 
lives. 
We might ask: Well, why do you need 
a bill like this if the right is already in 
the Constitution? Sadly, we need this 
bill because too many extreme right-
wing politicians, too many well-funded 
conservative interest groups, and too 
many conservative lawyers jammed 
into our judicial system at every level 
clearly do not trust women or patients 
or doctors. 
Now, you might say that assertion is 
unfair. But I am looking at actions not 
words, and here is what I see. In 2021 
alone, Republican legislators across 
the country passed more than 100 abor-
tion restrictions. In Texas, there is a 
law that has been in effect for nearly 6 
months 
that 
bans 
abortion 
before 
women even know they are pregnant. 
And not only that, Texas has empow-
ered citizens to sue one another person-
ally for the ‘‘crime’’ of helping some-
one get an abortion or providing abor-
tion care. 
The 
Supreme 
Court 
has 
already 
rubberstamped this appalling divisive 
law, and there is a very real threat 
that in a matter of months, they will 
end the constitutional right to abor-
tion in Roe v. Wade. 
What Republicans like to say, if Roe 
v. Wade is gone, that abortions will 
end. That is not true. Abortions will 
still happen. People will find a way, 
but many won’t have safe options, and 
their health and even their lives will be 
at risk. Even more so than today, 
women who don’t have the money or 
the time off or some other way—don’t 
have the means—won’t be able to get 
them. 
And this cruelty will fall hardest on 
women of color, women who have low 
incomes, women in rural parts of the 
country, and the LGBTQ community. 
To me and to many Democrats here 
today, that is just so wrong. A person’s 
ability to make the right decision for 
themself about pregnancy and par-
enting shouldn’t only be available to 
the rich or depend on what ZIP Code 
you live in. 
Unfortunately, that is the future the 
Republican Party wants for America, 
but it is not what Democrats want, and 
it is certainly not what my constitu-
ents in Washington State want. And it 
is actually not what the vast majority 
of Americans across the country want 
either. 
Sometime in the next few months, we 
will very likely see a historic reversal 
of a fundamental right Americans have 
known for nearly 50 years regarding 
one of the most personal decisions any 
individual can make—a right genera-
tions of women and Americans have 
grown up depending on and want to see 
it protected. 
That means that this vote tonight is 
historic as well. This is each Senator’s 
chance to stand up for an individual’s 
right to decide what to do with their 
own body and their own future. To-
night the Democratic position is clear: 
We trust women and patients, and we 
believe that Roe should be the law of 
the land. 
I hope Senate Republicans vote with 
us. But if they don’t, make no mistake, 
72 million Americans of reproductive 
age today may soon lose a constitu-
tional 
right 
every 
generation 
has 
known since Roe was decided in 1973. 
And if they do, they are going to know 
exactly who is responsible—the Repub-
lican Party.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S826 
February 28, 2022 
considering today, the Women’s Health 
Protection Act, is the first time—the 
first time—the Senate has taken an af-
firmative vote on stand-alone legisla-
tion to enshrine the right to an abor-
tion in law. 
And it is needed now more than ever, 
as reproductive rights are on the chop-
ping block in the legislatures, in the 
courts, and, most dreadfully perhaps, 
even in the Supreme Court. The right 
to choose is intensely personal, and, by 
and large, the American people support 
the protections enshrined in Roe. So 
Americans deserve to know where their 
Senators stand on this crucial issue. 
This vote—because we are in the ma-
jority—will, for the first time, accom-
plish that. The other side did not want 
to put this vote on the floor. 
When the House passed abortion 
rights legislation last fall, I said the 
Senate would act, and now we are hold-
ing a vote. I want to thank Senators 
Blumenthal, Baldwin, and Murray for 
their leadership in pushing the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act. And it is 
with strong enthusiasm that I will vote 
yes. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, 
this is the fourth time I have come to 
the floor of the Senate in the past 
month to talk about the crisis in 
Ukraine and to talk about what we can 
do here in the U.S. Congress to try to 
help the great people of Ukraine. 
Today, I come to the floor to express 
my solidarity with the courageous peo-
ple of Ukraine, who, as we speak, are 
under attack in Kyiv and Kharkiv, and 
in so many other cities and towns 
throughout Ukraine. 
Russia’s attack on Ukraine is a bru-
tal, unprovoked invasion of a democ-
racy—an ally and a sovereign nation. It 
must not be allowed to stand or it will 
create a precedent that unravels the 
international order that has kept the 
peace in Europe for nearly 80 years. 
Earlier today, Senator DURBIN and I 
organized a meeting of the Ukraine 
Caucus. We are the cochairs. We had 
Ambassador Markarova come, who is 
the 
Ukrainian 
Ambassador 
to 
the 
United States. Along with her came a 
member of the Rada, their Parliament, 
who happened to be in the United 
States when the attack began. They 
spoke with emotion about their coun-
try, about what they needed—Stinger 
missiles, Javelin missiles—to be able 
to fight against superior Russian air 
power and Russian tanks. 
But they also spoke with compassion 
about the people of Ukraine, about the 
sacrifice and the courage that they are 
showing. From the woman who has 
never fought before who now has an 
AK–47 and is defending her family in 
her apartment building to the Presi-
dent 
of 
the 
Republic, 
President 
Zelenskyy, all of them are showing 
courage in defending their homeland, 
their way of life, and democracy. 
I also just left a briefing that was an 
opportunity to hear from the Secretary 
of State, the Secretary of Defense, and 
other American officials about what we 
are doing as a country and to give us 
an update on their view as to what is 
happening in Ukraine. 
Just as the conversation with Am-
bassador Markarova and a member of 
the Rada was inspiring to hear about 
the courage and the resilience of the 
people of Ukraine, the briefing with 
our American officials was sobering. 
It was encouraging to see America 
stand up to protect freedom; but also, 
an understanding that the Russian 
forces outnumber those in Ukraine— 
and certainly their equipment, tech-
nology, their planes, and their tanks, 
and their ships are going to make this 
a very, very difficult battle. 
Thankfully, the world is rallying on 
this side of freedom. That is encour-
aging and inspiring. 
I was in Cleveland, OH, last night at 
a prayer vigil and then a rally. Over 
1,000 people showed up. Many were 
Ukrainian 
Americans 
who 
live 
in 
Northeast Ohio—it is a strong commu-
nity—but many were not. Many were 
from other countries: Latvia, Lith-
uania, Estonia, Poland, people who 
have family from Romania, Bulgaria, 
people from the entire region—includ-
ing some from Russia—but all standing 
firmly with the people of Ukraine. 
As was said last night at the prayer 
vigil: Tonight, we are all Ukrainians. 
Tonight, we are all Ukrainians. 
There were also demonstrations and 
rallies all around the country yester-
day. We are told over 40 cities had ral-
lies to support Ukraine and the people 
of Ukraine. 
Last night, I heard stories about fam-
ily members who are in harm’s way. 
Again, people with their voices choked 
with emotion were talking about what 
is going on, what they are hearing from 
their family members back in Ukraine. 
One guy who I know told me that his 
brother-in-law back in Ukraine who, 
again, has never picked up a weapon 
before in his life, has joined the mili-
tary. He is probably about my age. He 
has joined the military to put his life 
at risk for his country and for his 
neighbors. 
The people of Ukraine did nothing to 
cause this invasion—nothing. Their 
only desire is to live in peace. As Am-
bassador Markarova said this after-
noon: Ukrainians never attack any-
body. We just want to live in peace. 
Allow us to determine our own fate, 
our own destiny. 
That is what Vladimir Putin cannot 
abide, and that is what we in America 
and the rest of the free world must sup-
port Ukrainians in doing, to allow 
them to have the future that they 
choose through a duly elected govern-
ment. The freedoms and democracy and 
prosperity that we take for granted so 
often in this country, they relish. 
In 2014, at the Maidan, once again 
they threw off the shackles of a Rus-
sian-backed government. They know 
what it is like to live under the thumb 
of Russia, under the thumb of the So-
viet Union before that. They don’t 
want to go back. In 2014, they made a 
conscious decision to go forward, look-
ing to the West, to stand with us. 
I was there while the Maidan was 
still smoldering. The tires were still 
smoldering. People were still there, 
gathered. Even though the Russian- 
backed government had been removed, 
they still weren’t sure what would hap-
pen. Then an election occurred, a 
democratic election. And a President 
was elected. And a parliament, a Rada, 
was elected. And they began to fight 
for not just the freedom of Ukraine and 
the democracy in Ukraine but the rule 
of law to get rid of some of the oligar-
chical structure that Russia had left, 
the corruption. And now this, after so 
much progress. Since 2014, they have 
fought and fought and fought to be like 
us. And now this. 
Hundreds of innocent Ukrainians— 
men, women, and children—have al-
ready lost their lives in this invasion. 
Nobody knows the exact number. But 
we saw footage today on CNN, on FOX, 
on the networks, of apartment build-
ings that had been attacked by mis-
siles. We heard from the Ambassador 
that two five-story apartment build-
ings had been attacked today, and 
women and children had lost their 
lives. 
This humanitarian crisis, of course, 
is pouring refugees into other countries 
as well. Hundreds of thousands of peo-
ple have escaped to Poland, mostly 
women and children. Romania is also 
taking its share of refugees. 
But make no mistake: Ukrainians 
are fighting. They are fighting back 
bravely. And they have inflicted great 
costs already on their Russian invad-
ers. 
I commend those brave Ukrainians 
and Armed Forces who picked up arms 
against these great odds and have al-
ready denied President Putin his ini-
tial objective and immediate occupa-
tion. 
I want to particularly commend the 
brave leadership of Ukraine President 
Vladimir Zelenskyy. His defiance in 
the face of evil is what leads free coun-
tries and societies through difficult 
and dark days like Ukraine is experi-
encing right now. When it was sug-
gested to him that the West would like 
to help him to find a way to escape, his 
response this week was: ‘‘I need ammu-
nition, not a ride.’’ ‘‘I need ammuni-
tion, not a ride.’’ 
This has been a rallying cry not only 
for the people of Ukraine but around 
the world. Unfortunately, Ukraine is 
used to this Russian aggression. They 
have suffered already during an 8-year 
war on Ukraine since 2014, since the 
Revolution of Dignity, since the events 
under Maidan I talked about earlier. 
Fourteen thousand Ukrainian citizens 
have lost their lives at the hands of 
Russian snipers, Russian military, and 
artillery. 
I have been to the front. They call it 
the line of contact. It is the border now 
between Ukraine and these so-called 
occupied territories, the Donbas. ‘‘Line 
of contact’’ is a euphemism. It makes 
it sound like there are gloves touching 
at the contact. It is a line of war, and 
it has been for 14 years. Again, 14,000 
Ukrainians have lost their lives. 
I had to wear the helmet and the flak 
jacket because there were snipers that

day taking pot shots at Ukrainian sol-
diers. But I saw with those Ukrainian 
soldiers the patriotism, the nation-
alism that I knew would lead them to 
fight; that the miscalculation by Presi-
dent Putin was that, somehow, Russia 
would be greeted as victors. Some even 
said that he thought he would be greet-
ed with flowers. Instead, they are being 
greeted with AK–47s. And having been 
there on the frontlines, you knew this 
would happen. These Ukrainians are 
not going to give up their country. 
When President Putin decided to in-
vade Ukraine in 2014 and seize Crimea 
and come into the Donbas, it was clear 
that Russia was not a rational actor 
but one motivated by the irrational 
dreams of recreating an empire at all 
costs. The world warned Russia to 
stand down then, and they refused. And 
the sanctions were too weak. This 
time, the world again has warned 
Vladimir Putin to stand down. Instead, 
he has ordered airstrikes into the cap-
ital city of Kyiv. Now there are reports 
of Russian military deliberately strik-
ing 
hospitals, 
kindergartens, 
and 
apartment complexes, as I talked about 
a moment ago. 
These are war crimes, and the world 
is watching. I would say to Russian of-
ficials tonight, Russian commanders, 
there is another way. Stop this atroc-
ity. The world is watching, and the war 
crimes are being recorded. You can 
refuse these orders—and you must for 
the sake of humanity. Why would you 
want to kill your neighbors in Ukraine 
who are innocent and just want to have 
the opportunity to lead their life as 
they see fit? 
These are not just war crimes; they 
are a clear violation of Russia’s inter-
national commitments under the Buda-
pest Memorandum, the Minsk agree-
ments, the U.N. Charter, international 
law—as was the decree issued earlier in 
February, about 2 weeks ago, by Presi-
dent Putin, which recognized the inde-
pendence of parts of Ukraine, the 
Donetsk 
People’s 
Republic, 
the 
Luhansk People’s Republic. He did so 
as a pretext to ordering the Russian 
military to conduct so-called peace-
keeping missions in occupied Ukrain-
ian territories. 
We now see that this was one more 
case of disinformation. The lies and 
disinformation will continue, as they 
did today. But they are taking in fewer 
and fewer people because people can 
see what is happening. This is the age 
of digital communications, where peo-
ple can see videos in realtime of the 
war crimes being committed. 
I was among those advocating for 
tougher sanctions upfront, preinvasion, 
believing that might dissuade Russia 
from launching a full-scale assault. I 
cosponsored legislation to do just that 
and had hoped Congress would pass bi-
partisan legislation mandating tough 
financial sanctions, Nord Stream 2 
sanctions, assistance to combat cyber 
attacks, disinformation, in addition to 
advanced military aid. 
I honestly don’t know whether it 
would have kept Vladimir Putin from 
making this terrible mistake, but I 
thought it was something we should 
have done. We chose not to. And we are 
where we are. And now, we are seeing 
not just the United States but the rest 
of the world step forward with these 
tough sanctions. 
And I congratulate the Biden admin-
istration for getting the rest of the 
world on board, as they have. There is 
more to do. We have now targeted Rus-
sian banks, Russian elites with sanc-
tions, placed limits on high-tech com-
merce and Russia’s ability to do busi-
ness in dollars. All are welcome. In par-
ticular, the Treasury Department’s im-
position of economic measures that 
target the core infrastructure of Russia 
and more than 50 percent of the total 
banking system in Russia will have a 
devastating economic effect over time. 
Already today, they closed down their 
markets in Russia, their stock market. 
They are saying that foreign reserve 
cannot leave the country. So it is al-
ready having an impact. 
In addition, the administration’s an-
nouncement that they will sell 250 
M1A2 battle tanks to Poland, I com-
mend. I have been pushing for that for 
some time. These are the best tanks in 
the world. And Poland wanted them, 
and it is great we are now delivering 
those. 
We have now deployed more U.S. 
troops to Germany and Eastern Europe 
to enhance NATO defenses. That is nec-
essary, in my view. We are not in 
Ukraine but in the countries around 
Ukraine to ensure that, should Vladi-
mir Putin expand this war—and who 
knows whether he will or not—he will 
meet 
even 
stiffer 
resistance 
from 
NATO. 
We must make it part of a deliberate, 
coordinated strategy to enhance the 
military readiness of our Eastern Euro-
pean allies and do so quickly. 
I also applaud the United States 
working with our European allies— 
with Australia, with Canada, with 
South 
Korea, 
Japan, 
Taiwan, 
and 
Singapore on a coordinated export con-
trol response. Combined, by the way, 
these four Asian countries I named ac-
count for over 70 percent of the world’s 
semiconductor production. A ban on 
semiconductors, on chips, would be 
very costly to Russia’s ability to arm 
and resupply its military. We must be 
sure this action comes to fruition. This 
must happen. 
However, these are just first steps, in 
my view. We can and should do more. 
And I think there is a bipartisan con-
sensus now here on Capitol Hill to do 
just that. Let me offer a few more sug-
gestions. 
I welcome the news from this week-
end that we are going to be joined by a 
number of allies in sanctioning Rus-
sia’s central bank and cutting off a 
number of their institutions from the 
SWIFT financial system. We are still 
seeing details of these plans. But as of 
now, it looks like they still have some 
carve-outs in this plan for certain fi-
nancial institutions when it comes to 
SWIFT. I think it is a better idea to 
put all of Russia’s banks on this sanc-
tioning list. 
As for the central bank, I am glad we 
are getting global cooperation, but who 
we really need to step up to the plate 
is China. I am told China holds 14 per-
cent of Russia’s finances in reserves. 
China needs to know that this is a deci-
sion point. Will they stand against this 
tyranny that the global community is 
standing against or not? 
I believe we should also target Rus-
sia’s trade sector by revoking our per-
manent normal trade relationship, or 
PNTR, with Russia. In other words, the 
United States should no longer give 
Russia unrestricted access in trade to 
our country. This would have the effect 
of raising tariffs on goods from Russia 
to the rates at which they were before 
Russia joined the World Trade Organi-
zation and received this special status, 
PNTR, from the U.S. Congress. 
When I was U.S. Trade Representa-
tive, I helped negotiate this agreement, 
and it does give them certain privileges 
with regard to our economy. Free trade 
with the United States is a privilege, 
not a right. After Russia joined the 
WTO in 2012, Congress passed legisla-
tion to expand trade between our coun-
tries by eliminating tariffs on some of 
these imports. But as easily as we 
granted PNTR, Congress can take it 
away. Invading a sovereign nation, a 
democracy no less, is certainly grounds 
for us to take away that privilege. And 
we have the right to undo it under the 
WTO rules for national security rea-
sons. 
It would not be unprecedented. In 
1992, Congress revoked market access 
for Serbia and Montenegro as a result 
of their aggression in the wake of the 
breakup of Yugoslavia. 
Today, I will be introducing bipar-
tisan legislation to revoke unrestricted 
market access for countries who invade 
their neighbors, period. I call upon our 
trading partners to invoke their own 
national security rights at the WTO 
and similarly take away market access 
Russia, until this point, has enjoyed in 
their economies. 
This should be ended, this market ac-
cess, unless and until Ukraine’s terri-
torial integrity and sovereignty are as 
they were prior to the Russian inva-
sion. 
I was also glad to see the Germans 
have reversed their policy of not allow-
ing arms that were originally produced 
in Germany to be sent to Ukraine. This 
is a big deal. They are now joining our 
other allies that have sent weapons in 
the past and are sending more now. 
Germany is allowing another ally, 
the Netherlands, to send rocket-pro-
pelled grenades. I have been critical of 
Germany. I have been critical of Ger-
many on this very floor—also, when I 
was at the Munich conference in Ger-
many last week. I wish they had taken 
these steps sooner, but I commend 
them for taking these steps now. 
We also need to increase shipments of 
lethal military arms to Ukraine, to the

Baltics, to Poland, Romania—as well 
as increasing defense spending here at 
home. This weekend, the administra-
tion authorized an additional $350 mil-
lion 
in 
lethal 
defensive 
arms 
for 
Ukraine. That is a positive develop-
ment, and we need to get those weap-
ons there immediately. I understand 
that some have gone. Others have not. 
These Javelins and Stingers and other 
military equipment need to be in 
Ukraine as soon as possible. The Am-
bassador told me today they need them 
badly, and there is absolutely no time 
to lose. 
I understand the administration has 
also recently requested $6.4 billion in 
aid for Ukraine in an emergency sup-
plemental. I don’t know if that is 
enough. With hundreds of thousands of 
Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Poland 
and 
other 
countries 
supporting 
Ukraine, we need to provide these al-
lies with help to deal with this crisis. 
I also want to take a hard look at the 
amount we are spending on arming 
Ukraine and our allies. Now is the time 
to provide them with what they need. 
An aid package should increase our le-
thal defensive assistance, provide crit-
ical support to combat enhanced cyber 
attacks 
against 
Ukraine 
and 
disinformation, and prepare for a ref-
ugee flow out of Ukraine into Europe. 
By the way, we also need to enhance 
our own tools against cyber security 
right here in this country. Russia’s 
cyber warfare against America con-
tinues, and it could increase. There is 
legislation actually on the floor this 
week to do just that, the Cyber Inci-
dent Reporting for Critical Infrastruc-
ture Act and two other pieces of legis-
lation, FedRAMP and FISMA, our leg-
islation to help protect our critical in-
frastructure on the private sector side 
but also protect our sensitive govern-
ment information, national security 
data. So we can do something this 
week by passing that legislation. 
Finally, Ukraine and Georgia should 
be allowed to begin the process to be-
come part of NATO. You may remem-
ber it has been 14 years since NATO 
told Ukraine and Georgia they were in 
line for NATO membership. It was back 
in 2008. 
I do not believe this invasion would 
have happened had Ukraine been part 
of NATO, period. I was told when I pro-
moted this idea over the last several 
years that we couldn’t do it because it 
would make Russia mad. I don’t know 
what the reason is now. 
These two countries, Ukraine and 
Georgia, along perhaps with Sweden 
and Finland, if they are interested—I 
understand the Finnish Parliament is 
going to take this up tomorrow—could 
join the so-called MAP process, or Mu-
tual Action Plan, in NATO, laying out 
the specific roadmap for entry. It is 
time to put Ukraine on that final track 
toward NATO membership. 
Let 
me 
remind 
everyone 
that 
Ukraine is not asking us to fight their 
wars for them. In fact, the world con-
tinues to watch and see images of 
Ukrainian forces and regular civilians 
picking up arms and defending their 
homeland. They are just asking for 
enough help to defend themselves. 
This is about the fight for freedom, 
and it is taking place right now at this 
time in the country of Ukraine. It is 
taking place in places all around the 
world. I am told that today there is a 
move toward more authoritarianism; 
that more people live under authori-
tarian regimes than under democratic 
regimes, based on some analysis; that 
it is shifting in the wrong direction. 
Well, why then would we not stand 
by Ukraine? Because Ukraine is mov-
ing in the right direction. In 2014, they 
moved from being under the Russian 
thumb, authoritarianism, to democ-
racy, and now Russia is trying to re-
verse that. We must stand for freedom. 
Why? Because it is in our interests. 
Ultimately, we are the beacon of 
hope for opportunity for the rest of the 
world because of our freedoms here, but 
they are tenuous, and they depend on 
the allies around the world who also 
treasure freedom. 
There are two quotes from two U.S. 
Presidents that come to mind. One is 
from a Republican and one is from a 
Democrat. The Democrat is John F. 
Kennedy. And these are words that he 
actually never spoke, but he wrote 
them. And it was from a speech that he 
was meant to give on the afternoon 
that he was assassinated in Dallas. He 
was to say, at this time: 
[I]n this country, in this generation, [we] 
are—by destiny rather than choice—the 
watchmen on the walls of world freedom. 
We are the watchmen on the walls of 
world freedom. 
Senator 
KENNEDY
served 
in 
this 
Chamber. President Kennedy was right. 
Just as he stood up to the Cuban Mis-
sile Crisis, he understood that by des-
tiny rather than choice, it is up to us. 
Ronald Reagan famously said that 
you get ‘‘[p]eace through [s]trength.’’ 
To me, that is one of the great tru-
isms of our last couple of decades in 
this country; that we have to have a 
strong military if we want to have 
peace because only by the projection of 
force can we ensure that we can keep 
peace around the world. 
He also said: 
We know only too well that war comes not 
when the forces of freedom are strong, but 
when they are weak. It is then that tyrants 
are tempted. 
Think of the situation in Ukraine. It 
is then that tyrants are tempted. 
There is strong bipartisan support 
now for Ukraine. And this week, we 
should work hard to ensure that we 
pass this supplemental appropriations 
bill we talked about that includes the 
assistance for Ukraine but also to 
strengthen 
our 
ability 
to 
protect 
against cyber attacks; also to do what 
we can in terms of trade—cutting off 
the normal trade status with Russia, 
tightening up the sanctions on the cen-
tral bank we talked about. 
There is so much more we can and 
should do. But I find there is no lack of 
resolve right now from this Congress in 
its support for Ukraine and their peo-
ple—their people who are just choosing 
a democratic and free future, free from 
tyranny. 
The Ukrainian dream is now under 
attack by a brutal dictator who wants 
to remake Europe and disrupt the 
international order that has kept the 
peace for nearly 80 years. It is time for 
this Congress to speak with one voice. 
Freedom in Eastern Europe depends 
upon it, but so does global freedom and 
our freedom. Our allies and our adver-
saries are watching. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, first I 
would like to associate myself with the 
comments of the Senator from Ohio, 
Senator PORTMAN. He was eloquent, as 
always, about a pressing issue—not 
only the defense budget issues but the 
heroism of the Ukrainian people and 
the implications it should have for us 
in this Chamber this week and beyond. 
Thank you, Senator PORTMAN. 
Madam President, it is a little after 4 
a.m. in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, 
and President Zelenskyy is still fight-
ing, Ukrainians are still fighting, and 
Americans need to know their stories. 
Ukrainians need us to tell their stories. 
This story starts, of course, with an 
unjust, unprovoked invasion. The peo-
ple of Ukraine posed no threat. They 
provoked no violence. They lived freely 
on Russia’s southwest border with 
their iconic wheat fields. 
Many of us have been to Ukraine. We 
made friends there, but we also have 
Ukrainian American friends back in 
our States. 
Living freely on the southwest border 
of Russia was enough to provoke the 
small man—the tyrant of Russia—to 
hatred. It is bizarre. They lived in free-
dom. So Putin decided he was threat-
ened. 
Vladimir Putin, Russia’s desperate 
Nebuchadnezzar, 
thought 
he 
could 
crush Ukraine. He thought he could 
break their spirit. He thought he could 
put his boot on their neck. He actually 
thinks that freedom makes people soft; 
so he thought this would be easy. 
He was wrong. Over the last week, 
Ukrainians have shown us their fight-
ing spirit. They have shown the world 
their fighting spirit. They are standing 
firm against onslaught after onslaught, 
including the relentless targeting of 
now-civilian populations. 
Outmanned 
and 
outgunned, 
the 
Ukrainian Army is making Putin pay 
pints of blood for every inch his army 
advances. The truth is, Putin didn’t ex-
pect to encounter much resistance. He 
looked back on his experience in the 
Donbas, where he took big swaths of 
territory with a few dozen bullets, and 
he was convinced that the Ukrainian 
people would fold in the face of his 
giant army. He has been caught off 
guard, and his plans have been set 
back. 
He didn’t anticipate the bravery. He 
didn’t anticipate the passion. He didn’t

anticipate the heroism. He didn’t an-
ticipate 
the 
Ukrainian 
people. 
He 
didn’t anticipate the way ordinary vil-
lagers would stand and rise up against 
their occupiers, like the one small 
woman who approached a group of Rus-
sian soldiers and began handing them 
handfuls of sunflower seeds. Why? She 
told them it was so that flowers—some-
thing beautiful—could grow on the 
places where their bodies rot after they 
were killed in the Ukraine. 
She spoke for all Ukrainians. She 
spoke for the Kyiv grandmas arming up 
with 
AK–47s. 
She 
spoke 
for 
the 
grandpas who are having to reenlist in 
their late years. She spoke for the stu-
dents now learning how to make Molo-
tov cocktails. She spoke for fathers 
who have to kiss their children good-
bye as they head back to the frontlines 
of battle. And she is speaking propheti-
cally in advance for the mothers who 
are going to bury their sons. 
The truth is, Putin has been embar-
rassed over the last 5 or 6 days by the 
Ukrainians. 
Modern tyrants have developed a few 
strategies to fight truth-telling. The 
Chinese Communist Party’s version is 
trying to suppress all information—to 
choke it off, to make sure no one says 
anything that is true. Others, like in 
Russia, decide to blast a billion lies 
through state-run media, hoping that 
they can just blot out the truth and 
sow so much confusion and nonsense 
that people can’t find the needle in the 
haystack that is the truth. 
But in the middle of this crisis, these 
strategies are failing because people 
are hungry for stories. People need sto-
ries. We need stories. The best and the 
most powerful stories are almost al-
ways the true stories. And, right now, 
Ukraine is retelling an age-old story of 
good and evil. And the reason their 
story is so powerful is because they are 
telling the true story. If we were to 
stand 
here 
tonight—and 
Senator 
PORTMAN and I and many others have 
been in the SCIF today for many, many 
hours. I have been there four or five 
times, and most of us have been there 
the last hour and a half, 2 hours. And if 
we were to tell every story of Ukrain-
ian bravery, the Senate wouldn’t have 
time to get anything else done this 
week. 
But there is one store that stands out 
over the course of this last week, since 
Putin began his unjust invasion. It has 
given rise for the courageous Ukrain-
ian resistance to find for themselves a 
new motto, and this is the story of 
Snake Island. 
There is this little island in the 
Black Sea, near the mouth at the bot-
tom of the Danube Delta. It is called 
Snake Island, and it is really small, 
but it is both strategically and sym-
bolically important because it marks 
the boundary of Ukraine’s territorial 
waters. Ukraine has always stationed a 
small number of border guards on this 
island to keep watch. 
In 
2019, 
the 
current 
President, 
Zelenskyy, went to this tiny little 
piece of rock and he declared: ‘‘This is-
land, like the rest of our territory, is 
Ukrainian land, and we will defend it 
with all our might.’’ 
Nobody in 2019 knew he was speaking 
prophecy. But, right now, over the 
course of the last week, the world has 
seen and the world has heard the story. 
The world has heard the recording of 
what those 13 Ukrainian heroes did last 
Thursday as they sought to defend that 
little piece of rock because it was sym-
bolically important, as all of Ukraine 
was, that it is not Russia. 
Shortly 
after 
Putin 
ordered 
his 
troops to attack Ukraine, two Russian 
naval vessels approached Snake Island 
and their intent was to seize it. The 
Russian 
commander 
ordered 
the 
Ukrainian border guards that they 
must surrender. He thought he could 
intimidate them. But like their com-
mander in chief, the dictator—the liar 
Putin—he was wrong. They couldn’t in-
timidate these men. So he announced 
that they needed to surrender or they 
would be fired upon. The Snake Island 
guards refused to give an inch. One 
Ukrainian, after conversing with some 
of his colleagues a little bit—on a re-
cording many of you may have now 
heard—decided to turn up the volume 
and he announced: ‘‘Russian warship, 
idi nahui’’—‘‘idi nahui.’’ 
Russians decided to open fire on the 
island, pounding it with heavy ord-
nance and, eventually, troops would 
storm the beach and capture the garri-
son. But that one sentence—‘‘Russian 
warship, idi nahui’’—that is now the 
rallying cry of the Ukrainian resist-
ance. It was heard this morning when a 
Georgian gas station on the sea decided 
that it wouldn’t refuel the Russian 
ship. And when the Russian ship said, 
‘‘What are you talking about?’’ they 
said: No, you are the bad guys. 
The Russians said: Why can’t we put 
politics aside? Just let us buy some 
gas. 
These Georgians decided to repeat 
the new Ukrainian motto back to the 
gas station and said: Get the hell out of 
here. 
And the gas station pulled away and 
said: Russian warship, you guys look 
strong enough. Why don’t you row? 
That sentence sums up the spirit of 
countless courageous, brave Ukrain-
ians and what they are doing as they 
stand in the face of the much larger in-
vading forces. 
Snake Island is incomprehensible to 
a man like Vladimir Putin. He doesn’t 
understand human dignity. He doesn’t 
understand courage. He doesn’t under-
stand principle. He is too small. He 
doesn’t understand why people would 
fight for freedom. This is a man who 
spent the last 30 years—20 of them 
now—as the ruler fighting to return 
Russia to tyranny, fighting to take 
away the freedom of his people, fight-
ing to take away the liberty and free-
dom of those on Russia’s borders. He 
doesn’t want any of his near neighbors 
to know freedom. He thinks tyranny is 
the order of things. And, again, he is 
wrong. 
Unlike Putin, though, our people— 
the reason so many Americans have 
been rallying to the Ukrainian cause 
over the course of the last week—our 
people fully understand the spirit of 
Snake Island. We may not know Snake 
Island geographically, but we under-
stand what is beating in the hearts of 
the people who now wanted to echo 
that motto. 
We breathe freedom. We believe in 
the ideas of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. We strive to create a more 
perfect Union here, where everyone is 
recognized as having been created 
equal. We often fail in our execution, 
but it is our aspiration to affirm uni-
versal human dignity and the destiny 
of people to be free, for we believe that 
every human is created in the image of 
God, and there is nothing government 
can do to erase that. 
We have no love for strong men and 
tyrants. We understand the men of 
Snake Island in a way that Vladimir 
Putin cannot, for we believe in human 
dignity. We believe in universal rights. 
We believe in freedom from oppression. 
What we love, Vladimir Putin hates. 
Today, Ukraine is standing against a 
dictator who rejects each and every 
one of the principles that we have af-
firmed in our credo founding docu-
ments. The defenders of Snake Island 
and, indeed, all the members of the 
Ukrainian resistance now are looking 
to add their names to the list of heroes, 
from the warriors of Thermopylae to 
the activists who brought down the 
Iron Curtain. This heroism is timeless. 
Loving freedom didn’t make Snake 
Island’s defenders weak. Though they 
were outgunned, they were strong. The 
Ukrainians are fighting for a reason: 
love of country, hatred of oppression, 
and the aim they have to pass on a free 
Ukraine to their children for genera-
tions to come. 
This national resistance, expressed so 
eloquently by these guards of Snake Is-
land, has also come to find itself em-
bodied in another one of the great new 
heroes on the global stage, and that is 
President Zelenskyy. Just a few years 
ago, this man was an actor and a come-
dian. Now, though, he has shown such 
bravery that we see his name listed 
alongside heroes and great statesmen 
like Winston Churchill and Charles de 
Gaulle. 
As Russian troops bore down on Kyiv, 
Zelenskyy could have chosen to flee his 
country. You might have read some re-
ports that the U.S. State Department 
allegedly offered to evacuate him and 
his family. But, instead, Zelenskyy 
chose that he would stay on the 
frontlines and lead his people. ‘‘The 
fight is here,’’ he said. ‘‘I need ammu-
nition, not a ride.’’ 
Putin, meanwhile, is off hiding in a 
bunker, trembling in fear of his own 
people. People are marching in the 
streets to oppose his pointless war, and 
his only response is to try to choke off 
their speech and to imprison them. 
Zelenskyy, on the other hand, fights 
shoulder to shoulder with the men and

women who are trying to defend his 
country. You may have seen him 
breaking bread with some guys this 
morning. He has put his life on the line 
for his country, and he is not backing 
down, and his bravery has changed the 
world this week. 
We don’t know how things are going 
to unfold over the course of the next 
weeks and months, but Zelenskyy has 
changed the trajectory this week of 
Germany, of Finland, of Sweden, of 
Switzerland, and of kids all over the 7.8 
billion-person planet. Zelenskyy is a 
symbol, and as a courageous man, he 
has already changed the world. He is a 
bigger man than Putin. The whole 
world knows that. Putin’s own army 
knows that. Even Putin’s cronies now 
know that. 
But it is not just the Ukrainians who 
are going to be burying their dead. 
Russians are going to be burying many 
of their sons, as well. Thousands of 
Russians—many 
of 
whom 
are 
conscripts—will have died needlessly 
for Vladimir Putin’s lies and his van-
ity. 
Putin told Russian parents that their 
sons were off on training exercise and 
that they would be welcomed as heroes 
at the end of these exercises. He didn’t 
tell them they would be shot, lit on 
fire, blown to bits. He didn’t say these 
things because he is a liar. 
While we applaud the bravery of 
Ukrainians, we should not overlook the 
humanity of these Russians who will 
also die, for the West’s battle—free-
dom’s battle—is not with Russian 
moms who didn’t even know their boys 
were being deployed, women who would 
not desire to have the dictator Putin 
send their sons to ruin. Human beings 
are made in the image of God and are 
dying, and Vladimir Putin alone bears 
responsibility. 
His evil ambitions are destroying not 
just Ukrainian bodies and souls but 
also Russian bodies and souls, and this 
conflict, this chosen war of aggression 
by Vladimir Putin, is disgusting, and if 
he actually cared for anything bigger 
than his ego, if he actually cared for 
his people, if he actually cared for his 
nation, the generations of Russians 
whom this war is going to impoverish, 
then he would find an off-ramp now. 
That is what a bigger man would do. 
Ukraine, on the other hand, is not 
the aggressor here. We are seeing a 
people fighting for their survival be-
cause Putin has given them no other 
choice, and his thugs will keep on kill-
ing innocents until they are expelled 
from Ukraine’s borders. 
We obviously don’t know how history 
will unfold here, but we do know that 
truth is on the Ukrainians’ side, and 
the truth is this: that the boys of 
Snake Island and President Zelenskyy 
and the broader Ukrainian national re-
sistance are mounting a defense of free-
dom unlike anything the West has seen 
since the end of the Cold War. 
And that is why this story of Snake 
Island matters. It is why Zelenskyy’s 
bravery is so important, not just for 
Ukraine but for the whole world. And 
it is why that little woman’s sunflower 
seeds are so inspired—for ordinary 
Ukrainians are responding to Putin’s 
aggression with extraordinary heroism. 
We should be in awe of what our 
friends are accomplishing. Make no 
mistake though, war is not an abstrac-
tion. Our 21st century jargon about ki-
netic action and lethal force tries to 
paper over a reality as old as Cain and 
Abel. War is young men and young 
women struggling for a last gasp of air 
while their blood soaks into the mud. 
War is started by the old but usually 
waged by the young, and no one in 
their right mind would ever wish for 
war, for it is ugly. But the cause can be 
necessary, 
and, 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
Ukrainian cause is just. Their war for 
their country, for their freedom, and 
for their kids’ futures is just. The 
Ukrainians are willing to shed their 
blood for their cause, but, as impor-
tantly, they are willing to soak the 
streets with the blood of Russians, who 
have been sent by the comfortable ty-
rant Putin, who sends his people to die 
pointlessly far from home while he 
consumes the billions that he has sto-
len from those same people. 
Let’s be steely-eyed about the com-
ing days and weeks, because things to-
night, at 4:30 in the morning, in 
Ukraine, are ugly, and they are going 
to 
get 
much, 
much 
worse. 
But 
Ukraine’s heroes, despite of the dark 
nights that are ahead—their heroes— 
deserve our reverence. While it is ugly 
in Ukraine, their stories need to be 
told around the world by free people 
who believe in human dignity, for there 
is a great pantheon of freedom fighters 
across time, men and women who have 
died fighting tyrants, and we should 
tell their story. We must celebrate 
their cause, and we should arm them 
with as many Javelins and Stingers 
and rifles as they can possibly use. 
We should ship them rations and 
ammo, and we should share actionable 
intelligence in realtime with them so 
they can try to repel the invading 
force, for as long as they are fighting 
tyrants, America stands with them and 
America will arm them, and I am con-
vinced that this Senate will rise to the 
call to arm these Ukrainian freedom 
fighters in memory of those boys from 
Snake Island and all those who are 
joining their throng. 
Glory to Ukraine. Glory to her he-
roes. America stands with you.

MORNING BUSINESS 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION 
ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 49 
years ago, the Supreme Court issued 
its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade. 
By an overwhelming, 7–2 vote, the Jus-
tices declared that a woman’s choice to 
have an abortion is a constitutionally 
protected right. 
For nearly five decades, the Supreme 
Court’s holding in Roe v. Wade has en-
sured that millions of Americans can 
access their essential, reproductive 
healthcare rights. But today, Roe v. 
Wade is hanging by a thin thread. A 
majority of the current conservative 
Court appears poised to overturn Roe 
at the first opportunity. It is up to 
Congress to safeguard the protections 
guaranteed under Roe v. Wade by pass-
ing the Women’s Health Protection 
Act, also known as WHPA. 
For decades, abortion opponents have 
waged a relentless assault on women’s 
right to choose. And for decades, the 
Supreme Court—even with conserv-
ative majorities—has protected the 
core principles of Roe. But the tides 
are turning rapidly. 
In December, the Justices heard oral 
arguments in the case of a Mississippi 
law banning nearly all abortions after 
15 weeks of pregnancy. Because the 
Mississippi law is clearly unconstitu-
tional under Roe and its progeny, it 
was blocked by lower courts. But this 
Supreme Court, with its far-right ma-
jority, granted review anyway. And in 
their questioning, several conservative 
Justices seemed ready to overturn Roe. 
This threat to women’s health and 
freedom is unprecedented. In the words 
of U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth 
Prelogar, who argued before the Su-
preme Court on behalf of the Federal 
Government: ‘‘The Court has never re-
voked a right that is so fundamental to 
so many Americans and so central to 
their ability to participate fully and 
equally in society.’’ 
Even without the threat from the Su-
preme Court, the right of women to 
control their reproductive health and 
lives is under attack. Last year, law-
makers in 47 States introduced more 
than 560 laws imposing new restric-
tions on reproductive rights. 
In the face of this unprecedented as-
sault on reproductive rights, Congress 
must step up and pass WHPA. WHPA 
would protect the right to access repro-
ductive healthcare, free from medically 
unnecessary restrictions, no matter 
where you live. 
I commend Senator BLUMENTHAL— 
the lead sponsor—and all of my col-
leagues who support this important 
and necessary measure, and I hope we 
will have bipartisan support in passing 
it. 
(At the request of Mr. SCHUMER, the

WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION 
ACT 
∑ Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I am proud to be an original cosponsor 
of the Women’s Health Protection Act 
and pleased to submit my remarks re-
garding this critical legislation. I re-
gret that I am unable to attend the full 
Senate vote on this bill today due to a 
death in the family. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
would guarantee the right to an abor-
tion. The bill would allow a patient to 
access an abortion and ensure pro-
viders are able to deliver those services

without the burden of medically unnec-
essary restrictions. 
Now more than ever, we need to pro-
tect this fundamental right. Nearly 50 
years after the Supreme Court guaran-
teed the right to safe and legal abor-
tion in Roe v. Wade, reproductive 
rights are under direct attack. 
States are introducing laws at an 
alarming rate that seek to dramati-
cally limit or outright ban abortion ac-
cess. Some of these restrictive laws ban 
abortion after the 6th week of preg-
nancy, before many people know they 
are pregnant. 
Even more concerning, we may no 
longer be able to rely on the Supreme 
Court to protect reproductive rights. 
The Supreme Court recently finished 
hearing oral arguments in a case about 
Mississippi’s restrictive abortion law. 
Many Americans, including myself, are 
worried that the Supreme Court could 
significantly diminish or altogether 
overturn Roe v. Wade. 
The repercussions of such a decision 
would be devastating. According to the 
Guttmacher Institute, more than half 
of U.S. States are poised to ban or se-
verely restrict abortion access if this 
landmark decision is overturned. I re-
member what it was like prior to Roe 
v. Wade. I understand the heart-
breaking and often unsafe situations 
that pregnant individuals face. 
We must respond by passing the 
Women’s Health Protection Act. Con-
gress must do everything it can to en-
sure that individuals are able to access 
critical medical care and make the 
best decisions possible for their health. 
I am proud to cosponsor this important 
bill, and I won’t stop fighting to pro-
tect fundamental reproductive rights.∑ 
f 
THE WOMEN’S HEALTH 
PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. KING. Madam President, I voted 
to proceed to the consideration of the 
Women’s Health Protection Act today 
with some reluctance, not because of 
any doubts about the substance of the 
bill—I have been a strong supporter of 
reproductive choice throughout my 
public life—but because of concern 
about and disagreement with some of 
the 
provisions 
of 
its 
introductory 
‘‘Findings’’ section. 
Several of these provisions assert 
that opposition to reproductive serv-
ices, including abortion, is rooted in 
racism and misogyny. I don’t believe 
that this is true, and I do believe that 
it is unfair and insulting to the mil-
lions of Americans whose opposition to 
abortion is rooted in their faith and 
deeply held moral principles. While I 
disagree with their conclusion—that it 
is appropriate for the government to 
impose these beliefs on others who do 
not share them and thereby intrude 
into the personal medical choices of all 
women—I don’t question their motives 
and strongly disagree with the lan-
guage of the bill that does so. 
My vote today was not a vote on the 
final passage of the bill, but only to 
bring it to the Senate floor for debate 
and amendment. Had the motion suc-
ceeded, I, along with many of my col-
leagues, would have voted to remove 
this inflammatory and unnecessary 
language from the bill. 
Fundamentally, this issue is about 
who should have the power to make 
this most personal and difficult choice, 
the government or individual women in 
consultation with their doctors. While 
respecting the motives of those who 
disagree, I think that power should 
rest with the woman. 
f 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION 
ACT 
Ms. SINEMA. Madam President, I 
strongly believe a woman’s healthcare 
decisions should be between her, her 
doctor, and her family, which is why I 
voted to advance today’s bill. If it ad-
vanced, I would have offered an amend-
ment to remove editorial language that 
has no legislative effect and needlessly 
disparages everyday Americans based 
on their deeply and sincerely held be-
liefs. On issues so important and per-
sonal to many Americans, both parties 
should seek respectful understanding 
instead of ascribing motives or insult-
ing those who hold different beliefs. 
f 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION 
ACT 
Mr. 
OSSOFF. 
Madam 
President; 
today, I voted that the Senate should 
proceed to consider H.R. 3755, the Wom-
ens 
Health 
Protection 
Act, 
which 
would codify in Federal law the privacy 
of women’s reproductive healthcare es-
tablished by the Supreme Court’s Roe 
v. Wade decision. 
I support the privacy of women’s 
healthcare, 
codification 
of 
Roe 
v. 
Wade, and proceeding to consideration 
of this measure. Should the Senate pro-
ceed, however, nonbinding commentary 
in the bill’s preamble as currently 
drafted wrongly and unfairly impugns 
the motives and integrity of fellow 
Americans who view this issue dif-
ferently. 
I represent a State with a broad di-
versity of views, and I respect that di-
versity. I respect the opinions of my 
constituents even when I do not share 
them, and I recognize that good people 
may arrive at different opinions in 
good faith. 
So should the Senate proceed to con-
sider this measure, as I will vote that 
it should, it must remove from the pre-
amble to this bill divisive rhetoric that 
wrongly accuses Georgians who hold a 
different view than mine of having 
views rooted in misogyny. In a country 
so politically polarized and divided, we 
must recommit to tolerance and mu-
tual respect.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Australia—LAIRCM Line Replaceable Units 
(LRUs) 
The Government of Australia has re-
quested the possible sale of AN/AAQ 24(V)N 
Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures 
(LAIRCM) component systems required to 
support an ongoing upgrade of its large Air 
Mobility Platforms, which include C–17As, 
KC–30As, and C–130Js. As such, the Govern-
ment of Australia has requested to buy twen-
ty-seven (27) AN/AAQ 24(V)N Large Aircraft 
Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) System 
Processor 
Replacements 
(LSPR) 
(27 
in-
stalled, 0 spares); and thirty (30) Guardian 
Laser Turret Assemblies (GLTA) (30 in-
stalled, 0 spares). Also included are LAIRCM 
Control 
Indicator 
Unit 
Replacements 
(CIURs); Advanced Threat Missile Warning 
Sensors (ATWs); Smart Card Assemblies 
(SCAs); High Capacity Cards/User Data Mem-
ory 
Cards 
(HCCs/UDMs) 
(installed 
and 
spares); Simple Key Loaders; initial spares, 
consumables, and repair/return support; sup-
port and test equipment; integration and 
test support; personnel training, publica-
tions and technical documentation; U.S. 
Government and contractor 
engineering, 
technical and logistics support services; and 
other related elements of logistical and pro-
gram support. The estimated total value is 
$122 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
The proposed sale will improve Australia’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by providing modern protection for 
large air mobility platforms. These counter-
measures are crucial to defeating modern 
threats. Australia will have no difficulty ab-
sorbing these articles into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be Northrup 
Grumman Corporation, Rolling Meadows, IL; 
and The Boeing Company, Long Beach, CA, 
and San Antonio, TX. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of 0.5 Full-Time 
Equivalent (FTE) additional U.S. Govern-
ment representatives and 0.5 FTE U.S. con-
tractor representatives to support Australia 
from the U.S. for a duration of five (5) years 
to support program management and engi-
neering activities necessary to field and sus-
tain LAIRCM on multiple Royal Australian 
Air Force platforms. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer 
Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Ex-
port Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AN/AAQ–24(V)N LAIRCM system is 
a self-contained, directed-energy counter-
measures system designed to protect aircraft 
from infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles. 
The LAIRCM system features digital tech-
nology 
micro-miniature 
solid-state 
elec-
tronics. The system operates in all condi-
tions, detecting incoming missiles and jam-
ming infrared-seeker equipped missiles with 
aimed bursts of laser energy. The LAIRCM 
system consists of the Guardian Laser 
Transmitter 
Assembly 
(GLTA), 
LAIRCM 
System 
Processor 
Replacement 
(LSPR), 
multiple Advanced Threat Missile Warning 
Sensors (ATW), the Control Interface Unit 
Replacement (CIUR), and the Classified 
Memory Card User Data Module. The AN/ 
PYQ–10 Simple Key Loader is also a nec-
essary device. 
2. The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assem-
bly (GLTA) is a laser transmitter pointer/ 
tracker subsystem designed to track the in-
bound threat missile and point the laser jam 
source at the missile’s seeker. The GLTA 
automatically deploys the countermeasure. 
3. The LAIRCM System Processor Replace-
ment (LSPR) analyzes the data from each 
Missile Warning Sensor and automatically 
deploys the appropriate countermeasure via 
the GLTA. The LSPR contains Built-in-Test 
(BIT) circuitry. 
4. The AN/PYQ–10 Simple Key Loader is a 
portable, hand-held device used for securely 
receiving, storing, and transferring data be-
tween compatible cryptographic and commu-
nications equipment. 
5. The Advanced Threat Missile Warning 
Sensors (ATW) detect and declare threat 
missiles. The sensors are mounted on the air-
craft exterior to provide omni-directional 
protection. The sensors detect the rocket 
plume of missiles and send appropriate data 
signals to the LSPR for processing. 
6. The Control Interface Unit Replacement 
(CIUR) displays the incoming threat for the 
pilot to take appropriate action. The CIUR 
also provides operator interface to program 
the LAIRCM system to initiate built-in-test 
(BIT), to display system status, and to pro-
vide the crew with bearing to threat missile 
launch. 
7. The Classified Memory Card User Data 
Module contains the laser jam codes. The 
Classified Memory Card User Data Module is 
loaded into the LSPR prior to flight; when 
not in use, the Classified Memory Card User 
Data Module is removed from the LSPR and 
put in secure storage. 
8. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
9. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
10. A determination has been made that 
Australia can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
11. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to the Government of 
Australia.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Kuwait—Design and Construction of the Ku-
wait Ministry of Defense Headquarters 
Complex 
The Government of Kuwait has requested 
to buy planning, design, construction, and 
associated procurement of Kuwait Ministry 
of Defense (KMOD) Headquarters Complex in 
Kuwait. This includes provisions for all 
physical building and infrastructure con-
struction costs. The U.S. Army Corps of En-
gineers will provide life cycle design, con-
struction, and project management, engi-
neering services, technical support, facility 
and 
infrastructure 
assessments, 
surveys, 
planning, programming, design, acquisition, 
contract administration, construction man-
agement, and other technical services. The 
overall project includes over twenty facili-
ties, including primary headquarters facili-
ties for both civilian and military leader-
ship, as well as any and all engineering stud-
ies, designs, construction, and construction 
management services necessary in order to 
provide a fully functioning headquarters 
complex. The estimated total cost is $1 bil-
lion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by helping to improve the 
infrastructure of a Major Non-NATO ally 
that has been an important force for polit-
ical stability and economic progress in the 
Middle East. 
This proposed sale will improve Kuwait’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by modernizing the KMOD head-
quarters and associated infrastructure. Ku-
wait will have no difficulty absorbing this 
infrastructure, support, and associated serv-
ices into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this infrastructure 
and support will not alter the basic military 
balance in the region. 
No principal contractor has been identified 
for this sale. Contracts funded by this case 
are likely to be competitive acquisitions. 
The host nation has the ability to limit com-
petition if they so choose, but has not re-
quested to do so at this time. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of as many as ten (10) 
additional U.S. Government or U.S. con-
tractor representatives to Kuwait for a dura-
tion of up to seven (7) years to provide con-
struction management and oversight. It may 
be possible to utilize locally available labor 
to provide some oversight services in lieu of 
the assignment of U.S. personnel to the pro-
gram. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

On December 4, 2020, Congress was notified 
by Congressional certification transmittal 
number 0B–21 of a clarification of eighteen 
(18) FMU–139D/B Fuzes as MDE items. This 
transmittal further reported a clarification 
of the description for AIM–9X Guidance 
Units from ‘‘four (4) Sidewinder AIM–9X 
Block II Tactical Guidance Units’’ to ‘‘four 
(4) Sidewinder AIM–9X Block II+ (plus) Tac-
tical Guidance Units.’’ The total MDE re-
mained $4.08 billion. The total case value re-
mained $6.58 billion. 
This transmittal reports an extension of 
operation and sustainment costs for Switzer-
land’s F–35 (non-MDE articles and services). 
There is no additional MDE being reported 
with this notification; as such, the total 
MDE value remains $4.08 billion. The total 
cost of the new non-MDE articles and serv-
ices is $1.95 billion. The total case value will 
increase to $8.53 billion. 
(iv) Significance: This notification is pro-
vided due to the increased costs associated 
with the request for a longer period of Oper-
ations and Sustainment costs, as modified by 
the Swiss government from their original re-
quest. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity of the United States by helping to im-
prove the security of a friendly European na-
tion that continues to be an important force 
for political stability and economic progress 
in Europe. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensi-
tivity of Technology Statement contained in 
the original notification applies to articles 
and services here. 
(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: 
February 18, 2022.

TRIBUTE TO DR. SALLY ROCKEY 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is 
my privilege to recognize and honor 
Dr. Sally Rockey, the inaugural execu-
tive director of the Foundation for 
Food and Agriculture Research, and a 
pioneer in Federal research, on the oc-
casion of her well-earned retirement. 
Dr. Rockey’s career has improved 
countless people’s lives through re-
search, and she continues this mission 
today. She has been a leader in the ad-
vancement of research programs in 
both agriculture and biomedicine. She 
spent almost 20 years with the U.S. De-
partment 
of 
Agriculture 
managing 
competitive research grant programs, 
and she was with the National Insti-
tutes of Health—NIH—for 11 years as 
the NIH Deputy Director for Extra-
mural Research, where she led the op-
erations of the world’s largest extra-
mural research program. 
Together with Senator Pat Roberts, I 
established the Foundation for Food 
and Agriculture Research in the 2014

farm bill. Under Dr. Rockey’s leader-
ship, the foundation has become a sig-
nificant force in the agriculture re-
search community by developing inno-
vative private-public partnerships to 
fund rigorous food and agriculture re-
search. During Dr. Rockey’s 6 years at 
the helm, the foundation awarded more 
than 250 grants in collaboration with 
over 550 partners. Her engagement with 
a broad swath of partners helps lever-
age $1.40 for every dollar allocated by 
Congress. To put this into perspective, 
with Congress’ investment of $385 mil-
lion over 10 years, along with the 
matching funds, the Foundation for 
Food and Agriculture Research is on 
track to invest nearly a billion dollars 
in agriculture research, an impressive 
feat for a new initiative and a testa-
ment to Dr. Rockey’s leadership. 
Dr. Rockey’s legacy is not only auda-
cious research—and the lives that are 
impacted by this research—but also the 
invaluable support the foundation pro-
vides to the next generation of sci-
entists. During her tenure, the founda-
tion established several programs that 
specifically prepare today’s young sci-
entists to address the food and agri-
culture challenges of tomorrow. 
Dr. Rockey’s future-focused perspec-
tive has led the foundation to create 
AgMission. 
Founded 
in 
partnership 
with U.S. Farmers and Ranchers in Ac-
tion and World Farmers Organization, 
AgMission is an unprecedented global 
collaboration of farmers, ranchers, and 
scientists co-creating and rapidly ex-
panding innovation, adaptation, and 
the adoption of climate-smart tech-
nologies. 
AgMission 
embodies 
our 
shared vision that agriculture can be 
mobilized to address the climate crisis. 
I want to personally congratulate Dr. 
Rockey on the conclusion of her spec-
tacular career in public service and 
wish her the best of luck on the start 
of the next chapter of her life. 
We wish you well, Sally.

By Mr. KAINE: 
S. 3712. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 and the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974 to provide for periodic automatic 
reenrollment 
under 
qualified 
auto-
matic contribution arrangements, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing the Auto Reenroll Act 
of 
2022, 
alongside 
Representative 
KATHY MANNING, who has introduced 
companion legislation in the House of 
Representatives. 
Enacting 
this 
bill 
would improve financial security for 
Americans by strengthening their pri-
vate retirement savings. 
Nearly 7 in 10 Americans working in 
the private sector have access to em-
ployer-sponsored retirement plans, but 
a quarter of those with access do not 
participate in those plans. This means 
less money saved for retirement. Often, 
it means leaving money on the table, 
in the form of employer-matching con-
tributions. Encouraging more employ-
ees to participate in their workplace 
plans would increase their overall com-
pensation and improve their financial 
security and retirement outlook. 
The Auto Reenroll Act of 2022 would 
boost participation through a simple 
change to the automatic enrollment 
safe 
harbor. 
Automatic 
enrollment 
plans have been tremendously success-
ful at encouraging workers to partici-
pate in employer-sponsored plans, but 
employees who opt out of participating 
at the beginning of their tenure will 
likely never reconsider that decision. 
This bill would build on the success of 
auto enrollment by having employers 
reenroll nonparticipants once every 3 
years, providing them another oppor-
tunity to consider participation. This 
would encourage those employees to 
reassess their nonparticipation as their 
financial situation evolves. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this commonsense legislation to bol-
ster private retirement savings. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. MURKOWSKI): 
S. 3713. A bill to codify the essential 
holdings of Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 
(1973)) and Planned Parenthood of 
Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey 
(505 U.S. 833 (1992)); to the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Reproductive 
Choice Act with my colleague and 
friend Senator LISA MURKOWSKI, which 
would codify the protections for repro-
ductive rights established by the Su-
preme Court’s decisions in Roe v. Wade 
in 1973 and affirmed by Planned Par-
enthood v. Casey in 1992. We are intro-
ducing the Reproductive Choice Act as 
a substitute amendment to the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act before us 
today and as a standalone bill for fu-
ture consideration. 
Unfortunately, the Women’s Health 
Protection Act goes far beyond codi-
fying Roe and Casey. Among other 
issues, this legislation would severely 
weaken 
protections 
afforded 
to 
healthcare providers who refuse to per-
form abortions on religious grounds. 
Rather than just codifying Roe’s pro-
tections, the bill would undercut Fed-
eral and State laws that have been in 
place for decades and call into question 
basic conscience protections. 
The Reproductive Choice Act that 
Senator MURKOWSKI and I are intro-
ducing today would simply codify the 
essential holdings of the U.S. Supreme 
Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade 
and 1992 decision in Planned Parent-
hood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. 
Casey. Our bill carefully tracks the Su-
preme Court’s language and would pro-
vide reassurance to women that the re-
productive rights they have relied on 
for nearly 50 years will continue to be 
the law of the land. 
Specifically, the Reproductive Choice 
Act would make clear in Federal law 
that States may not impose an ‘‘undue 
burden’’ on the ability of a woman to 
choose whether or not to terminate a 
pregnancy prior to viability. It would 
still allow States to enact regulations 
to further the health or safety of a 
woman seeking to terminate a preg-
nancy, while stating that regulations 
that have the purpose or effect of pre-
senting a ‘‘substantial obstacle’’ to a 
woman seeking to terminate a preg-
nancy would be considered an ‘‘undue 
burden.’’ 
As is currently permitted under Roe 
and Casey, our legislation would allow 
individual States to impose restric-
tions on terminating a pregnancy after 
fetal viability, except when necessary 
to preserve the life or health of the 
woman. Notably, unlike the Women’s 
Health Protection Act, our bill would 
not restrict laws regarding conscience 
protections, including laws that pro-
tect healthcare providers who refuse to 
provide pregnancy termination serv-
ices for moral or religious reasons. 
Women should be assured privacy in 
making their reproductive choices, and 
I oppose efforts to overturn the U.S. 
Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. 
Wade. It is my hope that the Reproduc-
tive Choice Act will be enacted to en-
sure that women in this country are 
able to make their own reproductive 
choices as established in the landmark 
Roe decision.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 528—DESIG-
NATING FEBRUARY 16 OF EACH 
YEAR 
AS 
‘‘INTERNATIONAL 
BLACK 
AVIATION 
PROFES-
SIONALS DAY’’ 
Mr. OSSOFF submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 528 
Whereas, since the birth of aviation, Black 
Americans have made and continue to make 
significant contributions to flight, space ex-
ploration, and the aviation industry as a 
whole, despite significant adversity; 
Whereas aviation trailblazers like Emory 
C. Malick, the first licensed Black pilot, 
James H. Banning, the first Black pilot to 
fly across the United States, and Bessie 
‘‘Queen’’ Coleman, the first licensed Black 
woman pilot, barnstormed through barriers 
such as racism and sexism to have careers in 
aviation; 
Whereas Black American visionaries like 
William J. Powell, Jr., established the Bessie 
Coleman Flying Club, sponsored the first all- 
Black American airshow, wrote the book en-
titled ‘‘Black Wings’’, produced a documen-
tary film entitled ‘‘Unemployment, the 
Negro and Aviation’’, and worked tirelessly 
to mobilize Black American youth to pursue 
careers in aviation; 
Whereas Cornelius Coffey, a skilled Black 
American auto mechanic who dreamed of 
flying, and Willa Brown, the first Black 
woman to earn both a pilot’s license and a 
commercial license and the first Black 
woman to become an officer in the Illinois 
Civil Air Patrol, organized a group of Black 
air enthusiasts, established training classes 
and a school of aeronautics, and helped pro-
mote the 1939 flight of Chauncey Spencer and 
Dale White from Chicago to Washington, 
D.C., to campaign for an end to racial seg-
regation in aviation; 
Whereas the Tuskegee Army Airfield, after 
which the Tuskegee Airmen were named, be-
came a vital center for Black American serv-
icemen and servicewomen to train as me-
chanics, control-tower operators, and pilots 
of military aircrafts, launching the careers 
of many notable Black aviators, including 
General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., Amelia 
Jones, Linkwood Williams, Lieutenant Colo-
nel Lee A. Archer, Major Charles Hall, Briga-
dier General Charles McGee, and many oth-
ers; 
Whereas the Red Tails of the 99th Fighter 
Squadron and later the 332d Fighter Group 
known as the Tuskegee Airmen made pio-
neering contributions to the United States 
war effort during World War II and the sub-
sequent drive to end racial segregation in 
the Armed Forces; 
Whereas, in 1958, Ruth Carol Taylor be-
came the first Black regional flight attend-
ant in the United States; 
Whereas, in 1956, Patricia Banks-Edmiston 
filed, and, in 1960, ultimately won, a dis-
crimination case against Capital Airlines, 
paving the way for her to become the first 
Black commercial flight attendant in the 
United States; 
Whereas these historic firsts opened the 
skies for Black flight attendants, including 
Joan Dorsey, Diane Hunter, Patricia Grace 
Murphy, Undra Mays, Sheila Nutt, and Mar-
garet Grant; 
Whereas Oscar Wayman Holmes was the 
first Black air traffic controller and served 
as the first Black aircraft pilot and the first 
Black commissioned officer in the Navy, and 
Eleanor Williams became the first Black 
woman air traffic controller in 1971; 
Whereas Black scientists have played an 
integral role in the United States, reaching 
the stars through the brilliance and for-
titude 
of 
historically 
overlooked 
and 
unappreciated figures, including Katherine 
Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jack-
son, whose contributions in astrophysics al-
lowed the United States to send humans into 
space; 
Whereas Black Americans finally soared 
amongst 
the 
stars 
when 
Guion 
‘‘Guy’’ 
Bluford and Mae Jemison became the first 
Black American man and woman, respec-
tively, to venture into space; 
Whereas the research of Black Americans 
like physician Vance H. Marchbanks and 
psychophysiologist Patricia Cowings made it 
safer for astronauts to travel to space; 
Whereas Black American inventors helped 
revolutionize air and space travel, including 
through the long-distance airplane designed 
by Charles W. Chappelle, contributions by 
Gladys West to the development of the Glob-
al Positioning System (GPS), technology 
created by George Robert Carruthers that al-
lowed for photography in space, and the 
power source created by Lonnie Johnson for 
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration’s Galileo mission to Jupiter; 
Whereas Maynard Holbrook Jackson, Jr., 
the first Black mayor of the City of Atlanta, 
Georgia, is renowned for his major initiative, 
a diversity and inclusion plan to ensure 
Black business owners had the opportunity 
to participate in the expansion of Hartsfield- 
Jackson Atlanta International Airport into 
a major transportation hub, ahead of sched-
ule and under budget, all while paving the 
way for minority-owned businesses to sup-
port the aviation industry through construc-
tion, management, and concessions programs 
at airports across the United States; 
Whereas, on February 12, 2009, on a flight 
from Atlanta to Nashville, Captain Rachelle 
Jones Kerr, First Officer Stephanie Grant, 
and flight attendants Robin Rogers and 
Diana Galloway made history as the first all- 
female, all-Black American flight crew; 
Whereas Casey Grant, an author, aviator, 
and pioneer in her own right as one of the 
earliest Black flight attendants, has made it 
her mission to honor the legacy and con-
tributions of Black pioneers in aviation 
through her books entitled ‘‘Stars in the 
Sky’’ and ‘‘Stars and Beyond’’ and her ef-
forts to introduce a new generation of young 
Black individuals across the United States 
and in Ghana to the field of aviation; 
Whereas organizations, including the Orga-
nization of Black Aerospace Professionals, 
the Black Aviation Airline Pioneers, the Sis-
ters of the Skies, the Bessie Coleman Avia-
tion All-Stars, and the Black Flight Attend-
ants of America, Inc., continue to preserve 
the legacy of Black Americans in aviation; 
Whereas Black Americans have long served 
in every aspect of aviation, from skycaps, 
who greet travelers arriving at the airport, 
and ticketing agents, who ensure itineraries 
are in order, to ground crew, mechanics, and 
many others, who make the aviation indus-
try safe and reliable; 
Whereas the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion provides opportunities to eligible stu-
dents from historically underrepresented 
backgrounds in the fields of aviation, aero-
nautics, and science, technology, engineer-
ing, and math (STEM) through the STEM 
Aviation and Space Education Program by 
recruiting 
candidates 
from 
historically 
Black colleges and universities for programs 
such as the Minority Serving Institutions In-
tern Program; and 
Whereas public and private sector efforts 
to recruit, retain, and promote talented 
Black Americans through increased empha-
sis on intentional diversity, equity, and in-
clusion initiatives, programs, and commit-
ments and investments in programs that ex-
pose underrepresented groups to careers in 
aviation will ultimately help diversify the 
workforce for decades to come: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates February 16 of each year as 
‘‘International Black Aviation Professionals 
Day’’; 
(2) encourages the observation of ‘‘Inter-
national Black Aviation Professionals Day’’ 
through the recognition and celebration of 
the contributions of Black aviation profes-
sionals; and 
(3) requests that the President issue a 
proclamation calling upon the people of the 
United States— 
(A) to recognize the stories and contribu-
tions of Black American aviation profes-
sionals who broke barriers, innovated, and 
took aviation to greater heights; 
(B) to provide enhanced curriculum in 
schools, libraries, and other places of learn-
ing to educate all people of the United States 
with respect to the contributions of Black 
aviation pioneers; and 
(C) to support greater opportunities for 
Black Americans in all areas of aviation.

REINTRODUCTION OF THE RESO-
LUTION 
EXPRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR THE DESIGNATION OF THE 
LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY EACH 
YEAR AS ‘‘RARE DISEASE DAY’’ 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to reintroduce this resolution with my 
colleague Rep. RICHARD HUDSON of North 
Carolina. Our resolution supports the designa-
tion of Rare Disease Day on the last day of 
February. I am pleased that this resolution has 
been endorsed by the National Organization 
for Rare Disorders (NORD) and am thankful 
for their leadership on these critical issues 
over many years. 
Nearly one in ten Americans live with one or 
more of the roughly 7,000 known rare dis-
eases. More than half of those struggling with 
rare diseases—defined as affecting less than 
200,000 people—are children. Sadly, many 
rare diseases and conditions are serious, life- 
threatening, and lack effective treatments. 
These are not just statistics: I am sure most 
of us know at least one family member or 
friend who has been affected by or struggled 
with the unique challenges of rare diseases. 
Moreover, as we observe Black History 
Month, it’s important to know that African 
Americans and other minorities are especially 
vulnerable to rare diseases, including Sickle 
Cell Anemia and Sarcoidosis. These diseases 
and conditions—including Thalassemia and 
Hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis—dis-
proportionately affect African Americans. De-
spite these unique obstacles, African Ameri-
cans have an inspiring tradition of both com-
batting rare diseases and improving medical 
science. 
One great example is Dr. Charles Drew, an 
African American scientist who helped found 
the modern ‘‘blood bank,’’ which helped dra-
matically expand blood transfusions. A faculty 
member at Howard University, Dr. Drew’s pio-
neering work in blood transfusions took place 
against the backdrop of segregation and dis-
crimination. During his time overseeing the 
Red Cross’s blood plasma donation program, 
Dr. Drew was prohibited from donating his 
own blood because of the color of his skin. 
Despite these obstacles, Dr. Drew’s work im-
proved the practice of blood transfusions, 
which is now a lifeline for many individuals 
struggling today with rare diseases. The ex-
amples of Dr. Drew and countless other re-
searchers, physicians, nurses, activists, and 
patients underscore the importance of bringing 
additional awareness to rare diseases. 
Despite 
the 
many 
challenges, 
some 
progress has been made. More than 840 
drugs and biologics have been approached by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
the treatment of rare diseases. However, Con-
gress must do more to combat rare diseases. 
In addition, more work needs to be done to 
bring attention to the needs of those who 
struggle with rare diseases, and to celebrate 
their courage. That’s why Rep. HUDSON and I 
are reintroducing this important resolution. 
Each year, many individuals with rare dis-
eases and their loved ones celebrate Rare 
Disease Day to share their stories and edu-
cate communities of researchers, health pro-
fessionals, governments, and community orga-
nizations about how rare diseases affect them. 
More than 100 countries observe Rare Dis-
ease Day. Our resolution expresses support 
for the designation of the last day of this 
month as Rare Disease Day. Congress should 
recognize this work and improve our efforts to 
address the challenges facing the rare disease 
patient community. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join us in supporting Rare Disease Day’s des-
ignation on the last day of February to better 
champion people with rare diseases. I urge 
the House to support this resolution.

RECOGNIZING 
TAMPA’S 
LOCAL 
TRAILBLAZER, 
ROOSEVELT 
‘‘ROCKY’’ RATLIFF, III, IN HONOR 
OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
this Black History Month, I am proud to cele-
brate local trailblazers who have dedicated 
their lives to lifting up our community. I rise 
today in immense gratitude of Roosevelt 
‘‘Rocky’’ Ratliff, III, a lifetime public servant. 
Born in Perry, Fla., at 2 pounds and 11 
ounces, he gained the name Rocky by his de-
livery nurse because he was a fighter, despite 
his low birthweight. His parents, Roosevelt Jr. 
and Gloria, taught him that hard work and 
doing your very best in everything you do 
pays off. He moved to Tampa in 1984 and re-
ceived his bachelor’s degree in criminology 
from St. Leo University—becoming the first in 
his family to attain a college degree. He also 
attended Bethune Cookman University, where 
he was a member of the Marching Wildcats 
Band. 
Mr. Ratliff joined the Tampa Police Depart-
ment in 1998, patrolling the seven public 
housing properties that existed at the time. He 
led with his ‘‘Boots on the Ground’’ philosophy 
that stressed the importance of patrolling 
neighborhoods on foot to deter crime and fos-
ter invaluable relationships with the neighbors. 
This philosophy helped him work his way up 
the ranks to corporal, sergeant, lieutenant, and 
captain before retiring as a major in 2018. He 
had a reputation for building strong community 
relationships throughout the City of Tampa. 
Because of his initiative, our communities be-
came a safer place to live, work and play. 
Major Ratliff pioneered the Community Ori-
ented Program (COPs) in all three Districts 
and helped resolve community complaints and 
disturbances in city parks by serving as the li-
aison to the Parks & Recreation Department. 
After 30 years, Major Ratliff retired but contin-
ued his community involvement through men-
toring. He is a member of the Pi Iota Chapter 
of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. that started 
a mentoring program at Just Elementary 
School for 20 young men in the fourth and fifth 
grades called the Gentlemen’s Club. This pro-
gram is vital in helping young men develop the 
proper skills needed to guide them throughout 
life and furthering their education. In addition, 
he is CEO of Strategic Community Engage-
ment Consulting, LLC. He, along with Derrick 
Brooks Charities, developed a Community-Po-
lice Relationships (CPR) Zoom Forum to focus 
on addressing concerns between law enforce-
ment and our Black and Brown communities. 
The Forum has been a major success 
throughout Florida. For decades, City of 
Tampa and Hillsborough County employees 
supported an annual local MLK tribute through 
a scholarship fund and downtown march, and 
Major Ratliff was part of that effort during his 
tenure at the Tampa Police Department. In 
2018, he became a member of the MLK Pa-
rade Foundation. Today, the MLK Foundation 
hosts one of the largest MLK parades in the 
southeastern United States and engages with 
businesses, community organizations and en-
tertainment—over the past few years, numer-
ous bands from Historically Black Colleges & 
Universities have participated in the annual 
parade. In fact, 2022 was the first time ever 
that the largest HBCU bands in the country, 
Florida’s own Bethune Cookman University 
and Florida A&M University, marched to-
gether. 
Major Ratliff is married to Antoinette and is 
the proud father to four daughters, Tyrhonza, 
Bianca, Asia and Markayla. 
Major Ratliff has always answered the call— 
the call to keep our community safe and the 
call to preserve our community’s African 
American history. Madam Speaker, on behalf 
of a grateful nation and Tampa Bay commu-
nity, I am proud to recognize the service and 
leadership of Major Roosevelt ‘‘Rocky’’ Ratliff, 
III.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
VICTIMS 
OF THE SUMGAIT AND BAKU PO-
GROMS 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to mark the 34th anniversary of the pogrom 
against the Armenian residents of the town of 
Sumgait, Azerbaijan. 
On February 27, 1988, and for three days 
following, Azerbaijani mobs assaulted and 
killed Armenians—leaving hundreds of civil-
ians dead and injured and women and girls 
were raped. Some victims were thrown from 
windows and burned alive. Tens of thousands 
were forced to flee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E182 
February 28, 2022 
After two years, it was estimated that only 
40,000 of the 250,000 Armenian residents of 
Baku remained in Azerbaijan. On January 13, 
1990, organized Azerbaijani mobs turned on 
them, too, killing hundreds and injuring many 
more. 
The pogroms came as a direct result of 
years of vicious, racist anti-Armenian propa-
ganda by Azerbaijani authorities, dehuman-
izing the Armenian residents of Azerbaijan and 
laying the groundwork for mass violence. Az-
erbaijani authorities made little effort to punish 
those responsible, instead attempting to cover 
up the atrocities and deny the government’s 
role in instigating the attacks. 
On such an anniversary, we honor the vic-
tims of this ghastly injustice, and pledge to 
speak out against hatred so that history will 
not repeat itself. But tragically, more than 
three decades later, that is exactly what has 
happened. Beginning on September 27, 2020, 
and over 44 days, Azerbaijani forces once 
again targeted and murdered innocent Arme-
nians in Nagorno-Karabakh, also known as 
Artsakh, and displaced tens of thousands 
more. Today, Azerbaijani aggression against 
the people of Armenia and Artsakh continues. 
Armenian soldiers are still illegally detained 
and subject to torture while thousands of civil-
ians still live in danger. Religious and cultural 
Armenian sites that have fallen under Azer-
baijani control are under constant threat. 
These are the horrific consequences when 
aggression and hatred grow unchecked—and 
it is why, whether these crimes against hu-
manity occurred one year, thirty years, or a 
hundred years ago, we can never allow them 
to go unrecognized. More than that, it is why 
the United States must fully step into its role 
as a defender of democracy and peace 
around the world. We must not relent in our 
calls for the safe and unconditional release of 
the remaining Armenian prisoners of war and 
captured civilians, for the end of U.S. assist-
ance to the Aliyev regime, and for stronger ef-
forts to support democracy in Armenia and a 
free, independent Artsakh. 
So on this tragic anniversary, let us pause 
to remember those who suffered in the atroc-
ities of the Sumgait and Baku pogroms. But let 
us also recommit ourselves and our nation to 
doing everything we can, today, to bring lib-
eration to our Armenian brothers and sisters 
abroad, once and for all.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF 
JAMES CAPONITI 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize one of my remarkable constitu-
ents, James Caponiti, on the occasion of his 
retirement from the American Maritime Con-
gress and for his unwavering service of nearly 
half a century to the U.S. Merchant Marine. 
James’ multi-decade career spans an ex-
traordinary period which he began as a newly 
minted analyst at the Department of Com-
merce and which he concluded as Acting Dep-
uty Administrator of the Maritime Administra-
tion. From the Nixon administration to navi-
gating today’s challenges of declining U.S. 
shipping, James worked to bolster the U.S. 
Merchant Marine’s invaluable role in upholding 
our national security interests. For example, 
when he served as a Commerce Fellow on 
the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries 
Committee, James provided instrumental in-
sight and guidance in crafting legislation that 
implemented the Maritime Security Program. 
As the Chairman of NATO’s Planning Board 
for Shipping, he led efforts that emphasized 
the immense value of a robust domestic mer-
chant fleet to our European allies. 
He also served as the Executive Director 
and President of the American Maritime Con-
gress, a non-profit and research education as-
sociation dedicated to supporting the U.S. 
Merchant Marine. As Executive Director and 
President, James provided over 38 years of 
industry knowledge in showcasing the impor-
tant nature of maritime services to policy staff 
in Congress and the White House. He also 
spearheaded efforts to revitalize the U.S. fleet, 
increase the share of food-aid required on 
U.S. flagged vessels, educate shareholders on 
Export-Import Bank mandates, expand diver-
sity and inclusion within the U.S. Merchant 
Marine and promote sustainability efforts to 
mitigate the effects of climate change. 
James faithfully dedicated himself to the 
best interests of his country. His unshakable 
commitment to improving the quality of life of 
all mariners and strengthening the security in-
terests of our country embodies true American 
patriotism. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in honoring the remarkable service 
and wonderful legacy of my constituent, 
James Caponiti.

RECOGNIZING MONA GARIMELLA, 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH ESSAY 
CONTEST WINNER 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
exemplary work of Mona Garimella, an 11th 
grade student at Maggie Walker Governor’s 
School in Richmond, Virginia, and the high 
school winner of the Black History Month 
essay contest I hosted earlier this month. Ms. 
Garimella wrote a powerful essay on the leg-
acy of my former colleague, John Lewis, and 
the importance of getting into ‘‘good trouble.’’ 
I am inspired by Ms. Garimella’s words, and I 
encourage young people across our country to 
reflect on what this month means to them. 
Since its creation less than 50 years ago, 
Black History Month has been a time to honor 
and reflect upon the remarkable achievements 
of the African-American community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mona Garimella’s excep-
tional work in celebration of Black History 
Month. 
VA04 HIGH SCHOOL BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
ESSAY CONTEST 
(By Mona Garimella) 
‘‘Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, 
and help redeem the soul of America.’’ 
Former U.S. Representative John Lewis once 
said this, a man who continuously fought for 
equality and civil rights throughout his life-
time. Lewis’s work as an activist and gov-
ernment official made courageous strides in 
our society that were of the topmost neces-
sity. In a time of pure hate and discrimina-
tion against African American people, Lewis 
led significant protests, such as the iconic 
Freedom Fighters protests against Boynton 
v. Virginia. He continued his legacy as a lead-
er in multiple nonviolence activist groups 
and also when he eventually came to Con-
gress. Today, Representative Lewis’s life-
time work of ‘‘good trouble’’ represents the 
necessity for society to continuously fight 
for what is right and never be afraid to speak 
up for the greater good, as it is our job as 
American individuals to hold the govern-
ment accountable and remain steadfast in 
our morals so that we can prevent the tragic 
prejudices in our history from occurring 
again. 
It is hard to stand up for what is right. To 
speak up and defy social norms is something 
that takes courage to do, but it is of utmost 
importance that we do so; one must use their 
freedom of speech to get in ‘‘good trouble’’ 
and stand up for what is right. After years of 
inhumane police brutality against African 
Americans and the tragic murder of George 
Floyd in 2020, the Black Lives Matter move-
ment gained a surge of popularity larger 
than it had ever seen. Individuals of all col-
ors and backgrounds were using their right 
to protest to create good trouble and be loud. 
They made it clear that the violence and 
mistreatment of Black people in our country 
have been inhumane for centuries now. It 
was sickening how certain racial prejudices 
are still present today and even supported by 
some law enforcement officials. Some news 
sources viewed these protests as ‘‘violent,’’ 
but the activists continued using their 
voices because they knew it was the only 
way people would listen. As seen in Lewis’s 
civil rights work and the Black Lives Matter 
movement, protests are important to bring 
the necessary change to our society that is 
long overdue, particularly in civil rights 
issues because the country needs to hear the 
stories of Black people in order to truly un-
derstand the systemic issues with our legal 
systems. Thus, it is only through the contin-
uous use of speech to create ‘‘good trouble’’ 
that our country can at least somewhat 
right the wrongs in our legal system, as the 
people wronged by the system deserve at 
least that much. 
As students, along with using our voices, it 
is imperative that we remain unified in our 
efforts so that we can create greater change. 
If we all come together to share stories and 
further learn about other perspectives while 
living as a minority in America, we can 
truly create substantial change. John Lewis 
was known to be both a man of action and a 
man of words. Our words have so much value 
and power, and we must use language as a 
collective body of young activists to learn 
and come together to share these stories. In-
deed using one’s voice can also be viewed in-
dividualistically, such as through voting. 
However, the beauty of our democracy is 
that freedom of speech along with the right 
to assemble and protest are foundational ele-
ments of our country that promote commu-
nity buy-in. Voting is important, but it is 
our strength in numbers that can truly move 
our nation to change, and it is our job as 
young activists and the next generation to 
start being more mindful of the stories of 
those hurt by our nation so that we can 
come together and push through these issues 
collectively. 
When John Lewis was repeatedly jailed for 
his protests and civil rights work, he contin-
ued to use his voice because he knew our na-
tion still had a long way to go. When Black 
Lives Matters protesters were criticized for 
being too loud, the activists continued to 
lead their efforts because they knew that

they could not stop now; evidently, the fight 
against racial prejudice is a life-long battle. 
While it is not justifiable nor acceptable, we 
as individuals carry implicit biases and prej-
udices against other groups of people. How-
ever, it is our duty as informed citizens and 
sympathetic human beings that we continue 
to educate ourselves and create ‘‘good trou-
ble’’ so that we can continuously learn. It is 
only through acts of good trouble that we, as 
a society, can progress to a state of being 
where individuals do not fear being pulled 
over by a cop—one where Black people do 
not have to worry about being unfairly 
stereotyped and having to face inhumane 
treatment because of that. This is the abso-
lute bare minimum, yet this is where our so-
ciety has fallen behind. Because of individ-
uals like Representative John Lewis, we 
were able to dismantle a series of racist laws 
our nation shamelessly agreed upon at one 
point in time, but it is our duty today to 
continue that fight and John Lewis’s legacy 
to truly mend the wounds we have created.

ANIMAL ASSISTED THERAPY 
PROGRAMS OF COLORADO 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Animal Assisted Therapy 
Programs of Colorado for receiving the 2021 
Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s Non-Profit of 
the Year Award. 
The Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s Non- 
Profit of the Year is recognized for their sup-
port of Arvada and its citizens through 
impactful programs, services and overall in-
volvement within the community. Nominees 
are also evaluated on local partnerships and 
collaboration. 
Animal Assisted Therapy Programs of Colo-
rado supports Arvada by making the benefits 
of animal-assisted therapy available to every-
one, regardless of their ability to pay. It is one 
of the first counseling centers in the country to 
specifically integrate teams of professional 
therapists and their therapy animals to facili-
tate the therapy process. The program specifi-
cally aims to serve economically, physically, 
and/or mentally disadvantaged individuals and 
families. AATCP also provides many opportu-
nities for members of the surrounding commu-
nity to become involved as volunteers, taking 
care of the animals, the property, and the on-
site organic garden that produces much of the 
fresh produce consumed by the therapy ani-
mals. 
Congratulations to Animal Assisted Therapy 
Programs of Colorado for this honor and I 
thank them for their contribution to our com-
munity.

IN RECOGNITION OF MULTIFOCAL 
MOTOR 
NEUROPATHY 
(MMN) 
MONTH 2022 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, today I 
recognize the month of February as Multifocal 
Motor Neuropathy (MMN) Awareness Month. 
Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) is a 
rare disorder in which focal areas of multiple 
motor nerves are attacked by one’s own im-
mune system. Typically, MMN is slowly pro-
gressive, resulting in asymmetrical weakness 
of a patient’s limbs. Patients frequently de-
velop weakness in their hand(s), resulting in 
dropping of objects or sometimes inability to 
turn a key in a lock. The weakness associated 
with MMN can be recognized as fitting a spe-
cific nerve territory. There is essentially no 
numbness, tingling, or pain. Patients with 
MMN can have other symptoms, including 
twitching, or small random dimpling of the 
muscle under the skin which neurologists call 
fasciculations. 
The clinical course of MMN is chronically 
progressive without remission. The prevalence 
of this very rare disease is estimated to be 0.6 
cases in every 100,000 people, which makes 
it even rarer than GBS, a spontaneously self- 
limiting disorder in which 1–2/100,000 cases 
occur each year in North America and Europe. 
It is now established that intravenous 
immunoglobin (IVIg), a preparation of anti-
bodies obtained from healthy volunteers, can 
be readily given through an arm vein and pro-
vides benefit to patients with MMN. It is the 
only treatment for this disorder that is ap-
proved by the Federal Drug Administration 
(FDA) and regulatory agencies in Europe and 
Canada. IVIg can lead to improved motor 
function in most patients with MMN, with the 
response varying from minimal to very large. 
Early treatment shortly after symptom onset is 
always more effective. The treatment usually 
does not completely reverse all of the symp-
toms, and those patients who do respond will 
require repeated treatments to maintain their 
improvement. 
Founded over 40 years ago, the GBS|CIDP 
Foundation International is the preeminent 
global nonprofit organization supporting indi-
viduals and their families affected by Guillain- 
Barre´ syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory 
demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and re-
lated syndromes such as multifocal motor neu-
ropathy (MMN) through a commitment to sup-
port, education, research, and advocacy. 
On behalf of my constituent Brenda Perales, 
an MMN patient, member of the Board of Di-
rectors of the GBS|CIDP Foundation Inter-
national, and Co-Chair efforts to raise aware-
ness of MMC, I call on my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the month of February as 
Multi focal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) Aware-
ness Month.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE APPLETON 
NOON LIONS CLUB 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the 100th Anniversary of the 
Appleton Noon Lions Club. 
The Appleton Noon Lions Club was char-
tered on March 1, 1922, when 25 Appleton 
business leaders came together with a mis-
sion to serve their community. As the Appleton 
Noon Lions Club celebrates this milestone, we 
must look back on the club’s numerous 
achievements in the City of Appleton, the 
State of Wisconsin, and around the world. 
The Appleton Noon Lions Club has consist-
ently upheld and honored the mission of all 
Lions Clubs which is to serve. Over 1.4 million 
men and women who are members of Lions 
Clubs throughout the world are dedicated to 
serving their communities in times of need and 
the Appleton Noon Lions Club is no exception. 
From the beginning, the club has offered aid 
to the local Appleton Schools through sup-
porting countless educational and recreational 
initiatives, from musical instruments to play-
ground equipment. 
Throughout the years, the Lions have dedi-
cated their time to ensuring that their commu-
nities are equipped with the resources they 
deserve. I commend the outstanding and un-
wavering support that the Appleton Noon 
Lions Club has shown to Northeast Wisconsin. 
One of the many worldwide missions for the 
Lions is to prevent avoidable blindness and 
improve the quality for individuals who are vis-
ually impaired. With a focus to carry out this 
mission, the Appleton Noon Lions Club has 
completed over 70,000 vision screenings of 
students in Appleton and Menasha schools 
and collected over 8,000 used eyeglasses and 
500 hearing aids for the Lions Eye Glass Re-
cycling Center. Not only do the Lions support 
the visually impaired, but they also support 
other organizations that give back to the com-
munity. 
For 25 years, the Lions have offered tools 
and resources to assist older adults at their 
Senior Expo where they raised $250,000 for 
local charitable organizations. Through these 
initiatives and their 100 years of service, the 
Appleton Noon Lions Club is a true credit to 
their community and to Northeast Wisconsin. 
I invite all Members of this body to join me 
in celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the Ap-
pleton Noon Lions Club. The Appleton Noon 
Lions Club is a wonderful organization and is 
deserving of the highest degree of recognition.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. JANICE B. 
YOST 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Janice B. Yost, a pas-
sionate advocate whose efforts to improve 
health care and health outcomes has saved 
countless lives over the course of the last two 
decades. 
In 1999, after serving in leadership roles at 
both health care and educational organiza-
tions, Dr. Yost relocated from South Carolina 
to run a new organization in Worcester, Mas-
sachusetts, the Health Foundation of Central 
Massachusetts. A prolific grant developer, Dr. 
Yost helped the Health Foundation allocate 
over $50 million in grants throughout her 23- 
year career. Dr. Yost was able to develop re-
sults-oriented grantmaking and grant imple-
mentation, which enabled her to successfully 
push for significant changes in health care pol-
icy. 
Dr. Yost has worked hard to focus the 
Health Foundation’s mission not only on 
health care, but also on social determinants of 
health. Her ethos requires looking at the whole 
of a person’s life to determine the state of 
their health, and she engrained that belief in

the work of the Health Foundation from its 
start. As a result, she has been a catalyst for 
systemic and policy changes in everything 
from community development and affordable 
housing to food insecurity and nutrition. 
Madam Speaker, the impact of Dr. Yost’s 
advocacy in the field of public health cannot 
be understated. She has helped the founda-
tion fund grants supporting everything from re-
entry programs for formerly incarcerated peo-
ple to initiatives to address childhood trau-
ma—Dr. Yost has been relentless in her pur-
suit to help others. 
Dr. Yost is driven by a genuine desire to do 
good. She has beautifully blended the work of 
philanthropy, government, and the nonprofit 
sector in a way that alters the trajectory of 
people’s lives and serves as a model for pub-
lic health across the country. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress and all the people in whose 
lives Dr. Yost has made positive and immeas-
urable differences, it is my great privilege to 
thank and recognize Dr. Janice B. Yost for her 
service to the people of Massachusetts and 
her tireless efforts to create a more just and 
equitable world.

RECOGNIZING 
TAMPA’S 
LOCAL 
TRAILBLAZER, 
ROBERT 
SCOTT, 
JR., IN HONOR OF BLACK HIS-
TORY MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
this Black History Month, I am proud to cele-
brate local trailblazers who have lifted up our 
community and those who dedicate their time 
and talent to preserve local African American 
heritage. I rise today in immense gratitude of 
Robert Scott, Jr., a lifetime public servant. Mr. 
Scott was born in 1954 and it was during an 
impressionable age when he witnessed seg-
regation, brutality, marches, resisting through 
nonviolence and the numerous assassinations 
of national civil rights activists and prominent 
figures, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
Malcom X, as well as Robert F. and John F. 
Kennedy. But he also witnessed the change 
and improvements that emanated. His parents 
were Robert, an insurance agent and Doris 
Scott, a school principal. He graduated from 
Chamberlain High School and then from Be-
thune Cookman University with a bachelor’s 
degree in business administration. He also 
graduated from the University of South Florida 
Institute of Government Executive Fellows 
Program. 
Mr. Scott started with the City of Tampa as 
a personnel analyst and retired after 30 years 
as Division Manager of its Solid Waste De-
partment in 2010. During his decades of serv-
ice, he witnessed improvements in leadership 
and was proud to be part of diversifying lead-
ership within city government. For decades, 
City of Tampa and Hillsborough County em-
ployees supported an annual local MLK tribute 
through a scholarship fund and downtown 
march, and Mr. Scott was part of that effort 
during his tenure at the City of Tampa. He 
also served on the City of Tampa Black His-
tory Committee. He is now the owner of Scott 
Travel Agency, which specializes in group and 
cruise travel to all regions of the world. He un-
derstands that learning about other cultures 
provides a better perspective of how to treat 
people. Mr. Scott was one of the founders that 
established the MLK Foundation to build a 
family-friendly parade that started in 2015, 
fund scholarships for deserving students and 
honor community heroes that uphold the leg-
acy of Dr. King. Today, the MLK Foundation 
hosts one of the largest MLK parades in the 
southeastern United States and engages with 
businesses, community organizations and en-
tertainment—over the past few years, numer-
ous bands from Historically Black Colleges & 
Universities have participated in the annual 
parade. In fact, 2022 was the first time ever 
that the largest HBCU bands in the country, 
Florida’s own Bethune Cookman University 
and Florida A&M University, marched to-
gether. He hopes Tampa’s MLK parade in-
spires all cities throughout the state to host 
their own in an effort to unify entire commu-
nities. 
Mr. Scott has been a member of First Union 
Missionary Baptist Church for 48 years. He is 
a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity 
and a 32nd degree Mason. He has served on 
other boards and committees such as the Na-
tional Safety Council Executive Board, Amer-
ican Cancer Society, Gasparilla Parade, Super 
Bowl committee, and is a Certified Manager of 
the Solid Waste Association of North America. 
He is married to his beautiful wife, Barbara, 
and has four children, Michael, Pavonne, Rob-
ert III and Jason. 
Mr. Scott understands fully how remem-
bering our history, no matter how dark, can be 
used towards a better future. He also knows 
that preserving our own heritage is just as im-
portant as learning about other heritages from 
all over the world. Madam Speaker, on behalf 
of a grateful nation and Tampa Bay commu-
nity, I am proud to recognize the service and 
leadership of Robert Scott, Jr.

OBSERVING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE KHOJALY TRAG-
EDY 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, our 
friends in Azerbaijan paused last week to 
commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 
Khojaly tragedy and it is right that we join our 
allies in this remembrance. 
Since the beginning of the armed conflict 
between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the late 
1980s, it is reported that the Khojaly tragedy, 
which happened on February 25 and 26, 
1992, was the deadliest in this conflict, result-
ing in hundreds of lives lost, families dev-
astated, and the town destroyed. 
Although a cease-fire was negotiated in 
1994, the conflict is ongoing and flares peri-
odically, most recently in 2020. It remains my 
hope and prayer that the barriers to peace 
that have persisted for the last three decades 
can be resolved. 
2022 also marks the 30th anniversary of the 
U.S. and Azerbaijan establishing diplomatic re-
lations. Since then, Azerbaijan has been a key 
partner in the War on Terror, and the two na-
tions share a Trade Relations Agreement and 
a Bilateral Investment Treaty. 
The anniversary of this tragedy is an appro-
priate time to remember the lives of all the 
men, women, and children who were killed, 
and to recommit to working together to pre-
vent such atrocities from occurring again. 
Long-term peace, security, and regional co-
operation are in the best interests of the entire 
region of the South Caucasus and the world.

IN MEMORY OF MRS. ROBENA 
GAINES FLAKES 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to a phe-
nomenal woman of God, dedicated early child-
hood educator, and beloved role model, Mrs. 
Robena Gaines Flakes. Sadly, Mrs. Flakes de-
parted to her eternal reward on Saturday, Feb-
ruary 5, 2022. A homegoing service cele-
brating the life of this exceptional woman was 
held on Saturday, February 12, 2022, at 11:00 
AM at Good Hope Missionary Baptist Church 
located at 5230 Lee Road 235 in Phenix City, 
Alabama. 
Mrs. Robena Gaines Flakes was born in 
Phenix City, Alabama in 1935. After grad-
uating from South Girard High School, she 
went on to study Early Childhood Education at 
Morris Brown College and Columbus State 
University. She also attended American Bap-
tist Theology College at the Friendship Baptist 
Church campus in Columbus, Georgia. 
Mrs. Flakes was a loving mother to her chil-
dren and was a supportive wife to her late 
husband, Rev. Dr. Johnny H. Flakes, Jr. She 
was the compassionate first lady to his con-
gregations at Fourth Street Missionary Baptist 
Church in Columbus, Georgia and Good Hope 
Missionary Baptist Church in Phenix City, Ala-
bama. Together they used their deep and 
abiding faith in the Lord to make a tremen-
dous impact on their community, state, and 
nation. Their son, Rev. Dr. Johnny H. Flakes, 
III now pastors Fourth Street Missionary Bap-
tist 
Church 
and, 
in 
addition, 
previously 
pastored 
Good 
Hope 
Missionary 
Baptist 
Church as did his father before him. 
Mrs. Flakes was also the Founding Director 
of the Fourth Street Daycare Center (now the 
Robena Gaines Flakes Daycare) which was 
established in 1993. During her tenure as Di-
rector, the center expanded its roster from 56 
children to over 150 children. She also ex-
panded the facility as well as its programs and 
services to include an after-school program for 
elementary school students. It was also the 
first daycare to receive the ‘‘Center of Distinc-
tion Award’’ from the state of Georgia. She 
served in this capacity for 12 years until she 
retired as Director in 2005 and went on to 
serve as a Consultant. 
Mrs. Flakes received several accolades and 
awards for her work with the youth. These 
awards include the Rosa Parks Women of 
Courage Award from the Gamma Tau Omega 
Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. 
and the Gracious Ladies of Georgia Award. 
She also served as President of The East Ala-
bama Women’s Association. 
Mrs. Flakes accomplished many things in 
her life but none of these would have been

and support of her late husband, their chil-
dren, Rev. Dr. Johnny H. Flakes, III, Merle J. 
Flakes, and Sencira Flakes; along with their 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Prov-
erbs 11:25 says, ‘‘A generous person will 
prosper; whoever refreshes others will be re-
freshed.’’ ‘‘Mama Flakes’’, as she was affec-
tionately known, gave her life to God and 
dedicated herself to the service of others. On 
a personal note, when I came to Columbus, 
Georgia in 1972, she nurtured me as if I were 
one of her children. And, for that, I will be for-
ever grateful. Furthermore, during my two dec-
ades as a member of the congregation and 
choir at Fourth Street and throughout my ca-
reer, she and her husband shared advice, 
counsel, and wisdom with me and were al-
ways supportive of my career in public serv-
ice. I can say without reservation that she was 
one of the most passionate and warmhearted 
individuals I have ever met. I am proud to con-
sider Mama Flakes and the Flakes family as 
part of my extended family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more 
than 730,000 people of the Second Congres-
sional District of Georgia, and people all 
across the nation, in paying tribute to Mrs. 
Robena Gaines Flakes, for her selfless service 
to youth, the Church, and to humankind. We 
extend our deepest condolences to her family, 
friends, and all who mourn her loss. We pray 
that we will all be consoled and comforted by 
an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the 
days, weeks, and months ahead.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Arvada Economic De-
velopment Association (AEDA) for receiving 
the 2021 Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s Be-
hind the Scenes Award. 
The Chamber’s Behind the Scenes Award is 
given to an organization or individual who is 
an unsung hero in our community and is truly 
focused on ensuring the Arvada community 
and businesses are thriving. 
The Arvada Economic Development Asso-
ciation team has exhibited leadership and col-
laboration through their willingness to partner 
and support the Arvada Chamber of Com-
merce and the local businesses they serve. 
The staff and board members of AEDA offered 
their time and talent to ensure the appropriate 
resources were allocated throughout Arvada in 
order to have an optimal impact on the busi-
ness community as a whole. Through this in-
vestment, they have supported the economic 
recovery of the local business community dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic, critical shifts to 
the local workforce system, and helped ad-
vance business education programs. These 
are a few of the countless examples of how 
AEDA has shown their commitment to their 
partners, local businesses and our community 
all while continuing to make Arvada one of the 
best places to do business. 
Congratulations to Arvada Economic Devel-
opment Association for this honor, and I thank 
them for their contribution to our community.

SALIM 
BAMOUE, 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH ESSAY 
CONTEST WINNER 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
exemplary work of Salim Bamoue, an 8th 
grade student at Vernon Johns Middle School 
in Petersburg, Virginia, and the middle school 
winner of the Black History Month essay con-
test I hosted earlier this month. Mr. Bamoue 
wrote a powerful essay on the legacy of my 
former colleague John Lewis and why his life-
long work on voting rights is still important 
today. I am inspired by Mr. Bamoue’s words, 
and I encourage young people across our 
country to reflect on what this month means to 
them. 
Since its creation less than 50 years ago, 
Black History Month has been a time to honor 
and reflect upon the remarkable achievements 
of the African-American community. Madam 
Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing Salim Bamoue’s exceptional work 
in celebration of Black History Month. 
VA04 HIGH SCHOOL BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
ESSAY CONTEST 
(By Salim Bamoue) 
The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever devised by human beings for breaking 
down injustice and destroying the terrible 
walls which imprison people because they 
are different from others.—Martin Luther 
King Jr. Many people consider voting to be 
the most prominent voice us citizens have in 
office. While this is true, people of color do 
not have equal opportunity to voice their 
opinions. John Lewis fought for most of his 
life to preserve the voting rights of his Afri-
can American brothers and sisters. John 
Lewis’s impact on voting rights can not be 
taken away. He has influenced changes that 
have been made and changes to be made in 
American society for years to come. The 
struggle for voting rights has always been 
long and arduous, and John Lewis despite all 
the adversity, fought through it so that mi-
norities in America had equal opportunity to 
vote in the United States of America. 
John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940 
in a heavily segregated Alabama. He was 
born into terrible circumstances as he would 
grow up to be a victim of prejudice. When 
Jim Crow laws were in full effect and white 
superiority was preached everywhere and 
blacks were brutally persecuted due to the 
forceful stereotypes and rhetoric spread by 
white supremacists. Most people of color 
were gaslighted into believing they were ac-
tually inferior to whites. This genuinely ap-
plied to most things a normal American cit-
izen would do. Voting especially was a huge 
issue. The issue of voting disproportionately 
benefited whites in a way which might have 
seemed minute. John Lewis saw this and de-
cided his activism to the issue of voting 
rights. One of John Lewis’ most prominent 
and notable moments in his life was Bloody 
Sunday. On March 7th, 1965, John Lewis and 
other activists were brutally beaten for pro-
testing their voting rights. Voting rights 
have always been complicated. This did not 
deter John Lewis though as he’s been fight-
ing for this up until his passing. 
John Lewis’ legacy is still integral in our 
fight for voting rights. A bill is being worked 
on in his name to secure the votes of African 
American citizens. While for the most part 
the disparity between whites and blacks isn’t 
as notable, we are still currently struggling 
to attain our voting rights in a way in which 
we feel secured and just as considered as our 
white counterparts. John Lewis has fought 
for many years to attain voting rights for his 
people, even becoming a U.S. Representative 
so that people may look up to him and strive 
for what he strived for. The future looks 
promising as this new bill that may be 
passed in his name may directly affect black 
voters in such a way that more and more 
black voters are accounted for. 
Throughout history, people of color have 
notably been on the short end of the stick 
and we still struggle to attain even our vot-
ing rights, But late John Lewis has dedi-
cated his life to the cost in order to give 
black people an equal voice as to who we 
should place in our offices. The current state 
of the bill working on to be passed in John 
Lewis’s name doesn’t look so good as it has 
failed the senate vote twice and is exempt 
from filibuster, but that doesn’t mean we sit 
down and act as if we cannot find a com-
promise or some sort of way to finally secure 
our voting rights as we as black Americans 
should always strive to secure the rights 
given to us and the fruits of our liberty. So 
I call upon black Americans to keep on fight-
ing the persecution even through the face of 
adversity. There is always a light at the end 
of the tunnel.

IN RECOGNITION OF RARE 
DISEASE DAY 
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Rare Disease Day and 
to recognize the extraordinary challenges 
faced by Americans with rare diseases. 
A disease is considered rare when it affects 
fewer than 200,000 people in the United 
States. Rare diseases are far more common 
than they sound. Over 7,000 different rare dis-
eases have been identified to date. Unfortu-
nately, only 10 percent of rare diseases have 
FDA-approved treatments. 
To combat rare disease, we must not only 
make significant investments in research and 
treatments but address the racial disparities 
that exist within the rare disease community. 
While 25 to 30 million Americans have a rare 
disease, there are significant racial differences 
and people of color are particularly vulnerable 
to some rare conditions like sickle cell dis-
ease. From diagnosis to treatment, people of 
color face significant barriers to care. For ex-
ample, on average it takes a rare disease pa-
tient 6 years to achieve a correct diagnosis, 
but for patients of color it can take even 
longer. Additionally, despite making up more 
than 38 percent of the U.S. population, people 
of color comprise only 16 percent of research 
study participants. Underrepresentation in re-
search studies leads to a lack of under-
standing of effective treatments. 
Health equity should factor into every aspect 
of the rare disease landscape, from diagnosis 
to research and treatment. I commend the 
work of organizations such as the Rare Dis-
ease Diversity Coalition (RDDC), comprised of 
rare disease experts, health and diversity ad-
vocates, and industry leaders dedicated to ac-
celerating and advancing health equity for rare 
disease patients of color. Last November, the

RDDC, together with Global Genes, hosted

vened a diverse network of rare disease 
stakeholders to explore and address gaps in 
diagnoses faced by patient of color. 
Madam Speaker, as the proud Sponsor of 
H. Res. 948, a resolution recognizing Rare 
Disease Day and those individuals living with 
rare diseases, I urge my colleagues to join me 
in acknowledging the importance of health eq-
uity and the desperate need for robust rare 
disease research.

RECOGNIZING 
TAMPA’S 
LOCAL 
TRAILBLAZER, LILLIAN COOPER 
STRINGER, IN HONOR OF BLACK 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
this Black History Month, I am proud to cele-
brate local trailblazers who have lifted up our 
Tampa Bay community. I rise today in im-
mense gratitude for Lillian Cooper Stringer, a 
lifetime public servant who has been a leader 
to help ensure safety, dignity and vitality for 
thousands of neighbors. Born in Bartow, Fla., 
Mrs. Stringer moved to Tampa—into public 
housing—at a young age. Her mother did not 
complete middle school and she was one of 
five siblings. Precocious, in third grade Mrs. 
Stringer received the highest grade for English 
composition in all of Hillsborough County. The 
accolades and recognition she received from 
this became a pivotal moment that catapulted 
her into a true understanding that higher edu-
cation was key to lifting herself out of poverty. 
She worked hard to earn good grades and re-
main an active student, including as a dancer 
and member of the Middleton High School Ti-
ger’s drill team. 
In 1978, Mrs. Stringer received her bach-
elor’s degree in Radio, Television, Film Com-
munication and English Education from the 
University of Maryland College Park Campus. 
Mrs. Stringer had stints with landmark local or-
ganizations before joining Tampa Housing Au-
thority, including Hillsborough Community Col-
lege, Hyatt Regency and WFLA. 
She found a special calling where she cur-
rently serves as the Director of Community Af-
fairs for the Tampa Housing Authority, one of 
the largest housing authorities in the state and 
the state administrator for Assisted Housing/ 
Section 8. Since starting in 1990, she has 
served the agency in various capacities, in-
cluding all areas of resident initiatives; social 
services; inter-agency involvement; staff em-
ployee and resident training; as well as serv-
ing as a local and national housing advocate 
and agency spokeswoman. With little to no 
senior engagement available when she started 
with Tampa Housing Authority, she launched 
initiatives to improve senior safety and healthy 
community living—what she has erected and 
developed serves as a national model and will 
leave a lasting legacy. She developed numer-
ous programs for Tampa Housing Authority’s 
older residents through Elderly Services Initia-
tives to keep senior citizens engaged, includ-
ing the foster-grandparent supports and inter-
generational programs that connect seniors 
with youth. She also developed and coordi-
nated plans for the first on-site clinic at an el-
derly property and created ‘‘Senior Spotlight,’’ 
a column that highlights the accomplishments 
of elderly residents. She coordinated the first 
‘‘Senior Cabaret,’’ an event designed to pro-
vide an opportunity for the elderly to interact, 
socialize and meet elderly residents from other 
properties. 
Catapulting students in public housing into 
successful lives through education, as she 
herself did, became a passion and for years 
she coordinated a scholarship that also 
equipped students with luggage and laptops 
as they were sent off to college. She managed 
the first Family Day Care Homes, which pro-
vides an opportunity for qualified, unemployed 
seniors to keep no more than six young peo-
ple in their home environment, as well as the 
Youth Sports and Cultural Program, Resident 
Enterprise Assistance Program, Revolving 
Loan Program and the agency’s Recycling 
Center. 
Mrs. Stringer’s current and prior member-
ships include Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, 
Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, 
local chambers of commerce, Public Relations 
Society of America, American Association of 
University Women, Florida Bar Grievance 
Committee, Metropolitan Ministries Advisory 
Board and Leadership Tampa Bay. She even 
owned her own boutique, Chez Lilly, from 
2007 to 2011. Mrs. Stringer has been married 
for 40 years to former Judge Thomas E. 
Stringer and she is mother to Roderick Eu-
gene Cooper. 
Mrs. Stringer’s accomplishments did not 
come by mere accident or simply because 
they were part of her job duties. Rather, Mrs. 
Stringer has gone above and beyond her pro-
fessional obligations because her personal ex-
perience, passion for dignity, and commitment 
to preserving Tampa’s African American herit-
age led her to approach community engage-
ment in new, innovative ways. Madam Speak-
er, on behalf of a grateful Nation and Tampa 
Bay community, I am proud to recognize the 
service and leadership of Lillian Cooper 
Stringer.

HONORING MAYOR CHARLES 
BUJAN OF PORT ARANSAS, TX 
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, today I would 
like to pay my respects to a true public serv-
ant in the 27th Congressional District, Port 
Aransas Mayor Charles Bujan, who passed 
away on February 9th, after a battle with pan-
creatic cancer. 
Born and raised in Port Aransas, Mayor 
Bujan began his public service to his beloved 
community in 2007, when he was first elected 
as a councilman. In 2016, he was then elected 
Mayor of Port Aransas. 
As Mayor, he led the city through recovery 
efforts stemming from the damage caused by 
Hurricane Harvey. I remember meeting with 
Mayor Bujan on multiple occasions and he 
never missed an opportunity to advocate for 
the city that he led. I am proud to have 
worked with him over the years to revitalize 
the community of Port Aransas. 
My thoughts and prayers are with the family 
of Mayor Bujan and the community of Port 
Aransas during this difficult time.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Barber-Nichols for receiv-
ing the 2021 Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s 
Business of the Year Award. 
The Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s Busi-
ness of the Year Award recognizes a business 
that has established a reputation for providing 
a superior level of customer service while 
using ingenuity and innovation to overcome 
challenges. Not only does Barber-Nichols 
excel as a company but it also continues to 
support the community by participating in local 
activities and partnering with local non-profit 
organizations. 
Barber-Nichols is accelerating the delivery 
of innovative turbomachinery systems through 
collaborative customer relationships merged 
with integrated engineering and manufacturing 
to explore the universe and ensure sustain-
able energy. Barber-Nichols experienced 10 
percent+ year-over-year revenue growth from 
$30 million in 2017 to $60 million in 2021, 
supporting local Colorado jobs by growing 
from 100 to 160+ employees. In addition, Bar-
ber-Nichols remains committed to developing 
a next-generation skilled manufacturing work-
force in Colorado by sponsoring young talent 
directly out of trade schools. Barber-Nichols 
employees also show their commitment to the 
community they call home by volunteering with 
a variety of local organizations such as Adopt- 
A-Street City of Arvada, Community Table Ar-
vada Food Bank, Habitat for Humanity, Jeffer-
son County Schools Art Program, Children’s 
Hospital, Foothills Animal Shelter, and others. 
Congratulations to Barber-Nichols for this 
honor and I thank them for their contribution to 
our community.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
MATTHEW BRADY 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Matthew Brady, who peace-
fully entered eternal life on Thursday, Feb-
ruary 10, 2022. Nicknamed by family and 
friends as ‘‘Fred, Brady, and Big Uncle,’’ Mat-
thew Brady was a larger-than-life figure that 
left a positive impact on the lives of those he 
met. 
The son of Frank and Emma Brady, Mat-
thew Brady was born on Monday, February 7, 
1938, in Youngstown, Ohio. Matthew would 
graduate from South High School in 1956, 
where he was known as an all-around athlete 
and the community’s star football player. He 
would opt out of a football scholarship and join 
the workforce at Youngstown Sheet and Tube 
Company until 1961, where he would enlist 
into our nation’s army, where he would serve 
until he was honorably discharged in 1963 and 
returned to work as a steelworker. Matthew 
would eventually earn his stationary steam en-
gineering license in 1978 and continue to work 
in the steel industry until 1981. He would tran-
sition over to a 35-year career as a stationary 
steam engineer until his retirement with the 
Trumbull Memorial Regional Hospital in 2013. 
Outside of his professional life, Matthew 
was a linchpin of entertainment and gaining 
understanding with those close to him. He 
would entertain his seven children with several 
versions about how he and Laura Cooke, his 
wife of 57 years, met. Each tale would be fun-
nier than the previous one. His love for read-
ing books and newspapers helped his far- 
reaching knowledge continue to grow, possibly 
allowing him to be tricked into writing a few 
political science and history papers for college 
students. 
In all, Matthew Brady was a quiet, humble, 
hardworking man who cared for those he 
loved since he was young. The epitome of 
selflessness, Matthew would become the care-
taker of his mother, an older brother that was 
incapacitated by the war, and a niece while in 
high school. Matthew would continue to be 
their caretaker of his mother and brother until 
their passing 40 years later. That love and 
care will be what our community misses the 
most. 
Matthew will be dearly missed by his wife 
Laura Thornton Brady and his children Tisha 
P. Brady; Pia N. Brady; Jada M. Brady; 
(Andre) Ian Brady; Avery (wife Patrice) Brady; 
Leah A. Brady; and Aaron A. Brady. He was 
also greatly loved by his four grandchildren 
Julien and Justin Aina, Hannah Brady, and 
Ava Brady, the niece he adored and reared 
(Lenore ‘‘Buggs’’ Brady of Bryans Road Mary-
land, his sister-in-law DeLois Grant Brady, 
brother-in-law Ronald Thornton and his many 
nieces and nephews. He is preceded in death 
by his parents; and siblings, Frank (June) 
Brady, Jr., Edward Brady, Norman (Bobby) 
Brady, Helen Brady Traylor, Herbert (Billy) 
Brady, Margaret Brady, Eleanor (Betty) Brady 
Owens; and most recently by his youngest 
brother Samuel (Dickie) Brady. 
RECOGNIZING 
VETERAN 
REMMIE 
CHEW, U.S. MARINE CORPS, AND 
HIS VOLUNTEER WORK 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to recognize and 
honor Mr. Remmie Chew for his service to our 
country and his continuing service to our Rich-
mond community. 
Mr. Chew served in the United States Ma-
rine Corps for sixteen years, and was sta-
tioned across the globe, from Okinawa, Japan 
to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. He now 
continues his service in the Richmond commu-
nity with his non-profit organization, A Serv-
ant’s Heart Ministry, that collects goods and 
distributes them to those experiencing home-
lessness. 
His inspiration for his non-profit came while 
getting his master’s degree at Virginia Union 
University’s School of Theology in 2020. As a 
fellow alumnus of that venerable institution, I 
have the utmost respect for the way Mr. Chew 
lives the values we learned. As churches and 
others serve meals, it was important to Mr. 
Chew to provide food, clothing, and other es-
sential items to the people of Richmond, wher-
ever they may be. 
Instead of looking for praise, Mr. Chew finds 
reward with helping and making connections 
with our communities. Mr. Chew’s dedication 
to others, both in our Richmond communities 
and to our nation during his time in the U.S. 
Marine Corps, exemplifies his selfless service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Remmie Chew for his 
devotion and service to the public good, to our 
communities, and to our Nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 70TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
MARINE 
CORPS LOGISTICS BASE IN AL-
BANY, GEORGIA 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the men and 
women who have served and currently serve 
at the Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB) in 
Albany, Georgia. On Thursday, March 1, 
2022, base personnel, Armed Services vet-
erans, and local dignitaries will celebrate the 
facility’s 70th anniversary. 
Over the last 70 years, the brave men and 
women who have served at MCLB, Albany 
have made significant contributions in defend-
ing our homeland and safeguarding our lib-
erties. 
On March 1, 1952, MCLB, Albany was com-
missioned as the Marine Corps Depot of Sup-
plies. By 1954 the station was sufficiently 
complete with warehouses and administration 
buildings to assume supply support for Ma-
rines east of the Rocky Mountains and in the 
Atlantic area. In 1967, the base became a 
Storage Activity and Depot Maintenance Activ-
ity. 
On January 17, 1990, the Commandant of 
the Marine Corps designated the Commanding 
General, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany 
to also be Commander, Marine Corps Logis-
tics Bases. The reorganization placed control 
of Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Cali-
fornia; Blount Island Command, Jacksonville, 
Florida, as well as Marine Corps Logistics 
Base, Albany under this single command. 
Over the last several decades, MCLB, Al-
bany has provided exceptional support to the 
Marine Air Ground Task Forces sent to South-
west Asia. The MCLB, Albany military and ci-
vilian team’s hard work and dedication, com-
bined with equal efforts from MCLB, Barstow 
and Blount Island Command have reaped out-
standing results for our nation’s Armed Serv-
ices. 
In 2021, MCLB, Albany won in the Fiscal 
Year 
2021 
SECNAV 
Energy 
Excellence 
Award’s small installation category for its 
achievements in policy implementation, reduc-
tions in energy and water intensity, cybersecu-
rity, and overall commitment to energy security 
planning. This vital Net Zero Initiative from 
MCLB, Albany reduced the energy cost 
aboard the installation and helped the base 
nearly reach its goal in FY 2020 of covering all 
critical building energy loads in the event of an 
outage by increasing its sources of on-site 
generation. 
Madam Speaker, I have had the pleasure of 
traveling to many U.S. military installations 
around the world and the Marine Corps Logis-
tics Base in Albany, Georgia is one of the fin-
est military bases I have ever had the pleas-
ure of visiting. 
Through my ongoing interaction with MCLB, 
Albany personnel, one of the things I have 
come to admire about our nation’s Marines is 
that their commitment to serving our country 
does not end once they separate from Active 
Duty. In their everyday life and actions off 
base, the personnel at MCLB, Albany have re-
mained faithful to serving their fellow Marines, 
their community, and their nation. They have 
truly exemplified the U.S. Marine Corp’s motto, 
Semper Fidelis. 
MCLB, Albany Marines hold themselves to a 
higher standard—that service to our nation is 
a lifelong commitment, not just a tour of duty. 
Whether it is going on to work as police-
men, fire fighters, teachers, or business pro-
fessionals, a MCLB, Albany Marines’ commit-
ment to making our nation better remains at 
the fundamental core of what not only makes 
them great during their Armed Services ca-
reer, but what will also make them invaluable 
members of our society once their military ca-
reers end and their transition into civilian life 
begins. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 people of the Second Congressional 
District of Georgia in paying tribute to the men 
and women who have served at the Marine

HONORING JAMES HONG 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize James Hong, a venerable actor with 
one of the most prolific acting careers in Holly-
wood history. I was fortunate enough to meet 
with Mr. Hong in advance of his induction to 
the Hollywood Walk of Fame where he will re-
ceive his very own star commemorating his 
outstanding career. For nearly seven decades, 
Mr. Hong has been gracing our screens with 
his legendary performances, amassing over 
672 credits since the outset of his career. At 
92 years old, Mr. Hong has no intentions of 
slowing down. 
Mr. Hong was born in 1929 in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota to parents who immigrated from 
China. His father owned a local herb store, 
one of only two stores within the city’s China-
town. It was within these walls that Mr. Hong’s 
passion for the arts was cemented when, on 
weekends, local Chinese workers gathered at 
his father’s store and watched as a young Mr. 
Hong put on performances for them. 
While dreams of being an entertainer re-
mained strong as ever, Mr. Hong’s parents 
urged him to become an engineer, so he en-
rolled at the University of Minnesota to study 
civil engineering. But his studies were inter-
rupted when he was drafted to the Korean 
War. While at training at Camp McClellan in 
Alabama, Mr. Hong did some impressions for 
his fellow soldiers and quickly caught the at-
tention of the Camp’s General. Mr. Hong was 
ordered to remain at the base to provide en-
tertainment to the troops and coordinate public 
relations with the community, preventing him 
from being deployed to Korea during the war. 
After his service, Mr. Hong completed his 
civil engineering degree at the University of 
Southern California and worked for the County 
of Los Angeles in road repair. Then in 1954, 
Mr. Hong appeared on Groucho Marx’s radio 
show, ‘‘You Bet Your Life,’’ where he did im-
pressions, including of Groucho himself. His 
appearance was so popular that the radio 
show received the second largest amount of 
fan mail for any episode. This appearance 
kickstarted Mr. Hong’s incredible career in 
Hollywood and was one of the first of what 
would become hundreds and hundreds of 
credits, including ‘‘Chinatown,’’ ‘‘Blade Run-
ner,’’ ‘‘Bonanza,’’ ‘‘Big Trouble in Little China,’’ 
‘‘Soldier of Fortune,’’ ‘‘Mulan,’’ ‘‘Seinfeld,’’ 
‘‘The Big Bang Theory’’ and so many more. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Hong often faced dis-
crimination on set, and many of the roles he 
was given were stereotypical, demeaning por-
trayals of Chinese people. Faced with the dif-
ficult choice of playing a character that was 
written in a racist manner or not working at all, 
Mr. Hong ultimately decided to continue his 
acting career, but worked tirelessly to bring 
complexity to roles that so frequently lacked 
humanity. 
Taking his own experiences of discrimina-
tion, Mr. Hong set out to make the entertain-
ment industry more accessible and humane, 
and to help expose Asian American and Pa-
cific Islander (AAPI) actors to opportunities. 
When given a script for the 1962 film ‘‘The 
Confessions of an Opium Eater,’’ Mr. Hong 
was taken aback by the stereotypical, negative 
depictions of Asian characters. So, he orga-
nized a group to approach the director to 
argue that a rewrite of the script was needed 
to make its AAPI characters more human. 
Even though the director ultimately refused a 
rewrite, Mr. Hong remained committed to ad-
vocating for better, more just representation. 
These experiences eventually inspired Mr. 
Hong and fellow actor Mako Iwamatsu to form 
an acting troop for Asian American actors, 
which eventually turned into the renowned the-
ater group, East West Players. Since its cre-
ation, East West Players has played an instru-
mental role in showcasing productions formu-
lated, designed and executed by AAPI cre-
ators. On top of that, East West Players fos-
tered a space for AAPI artists to express 
themselves freely and form a community. Mr. 
Hong’s dedication to shedding light on the 
abilities and accomplishments of AAPI artists 
is clear from the group’s alumni which include 
names like George Takei, John Cho, Daniel 
Dae Kim, Randall Park and countless others. 
As one of the most accomplished actors in 
Hollywood history, James Hong has enter-
tained and brought joy to innumerable viewers 
across the country and world. Not only has 
Mr. Hong committed his entire professional life 
to entertainment but has likewise dedicated 
himself to uplifting the abilities and careers of 
AAPI actors and has therefore paved the way 
for future generations of performers to come. 
It can be said with certainty that Mr. Hong has 
made an immeasurable, positive impact in the 
performing arts. It is my distinct honor to com-
memorate his career and life.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF LILLIE E. PERKINS 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
deep sadness and immense gratitude that I 
stand to join the many family, friends, and col-
leagues who have gathered to remember Mrs. 
Lillie E. Perkins, a New Haven institution in 
our education community. I have often spoke 
of our nation’s need for talented, creative edu-
cators ready to help our children learn and 
grow. Lillie was not only that kind of educator, 
but she was also that kind of community lead-
er. She inspired your students and colleagues 
alike and will be deeply missed by all of those 
fortunate enough to have known her. 
At the tender age of 7 Lillie knew that she 
was ‘‘born to teach.’’ In pursuit of this dream, 
she earned her bachelor’s degree at Fayette-
ville State University before moving to Con-
necticut with her husband, James, and earning 
her master’s degree from the University of 
Connecticut and an Administrative Sixth Year 
Certificate from Southern Connecticut State 
University. She and James raised their daugh-
ters, Tiara and Sharon, and Lillie began her 
thirty-six-year career with the New Haven Pub-
lic School system. Lillie was an extraordinarily 
gifted teacher with a passion and compassion 
that was felt by the students in her classroom 
as well as kids across the community. 
In addition to her work in the classroom, 
Lillie’s invaluable contributions to young peo-
ple and the community have left an indelible 
mark. Early in her career she recognized the 
need for young people to have the opportunity 
to express themselves in a positive way after 
school hours. Whether with the Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King Choir, the Helene Grant School 
Choir, or the remarkable Unity Boys Choir, 
she found ways for these young people from 
across Greater New Haven to come together 
and achieve extraordinary accomplishments 
for which they can be very proud. I have had 
the opportunity to hear the angelic voices of 
the Unity Boys Choir and have seen first-hand 
the light in their eyes that comes with the ex-
citement and adoration of the crowds they are 
entertaining, Lillie touched their lives in a very 
special way—not only allowing them to share 
their musical talents with others but teaching 
them the importance of and satisfaction in giv-
ing back to the community. 
Lillie’s engagement in the community also 
extended beyond her service to the school 
system. She volunteered her time and ener-
gies to a number of other programs commu-
nity initiatives including the Mayor’s Youth 
Service Program, the Toys/Teas/Toys Closets 
program at Yale Children’s Hospital, the 1995 
Special Olympic World Garnes in Connecticut, 
the Kids Protection Network Program, Chris-
tian Community Action’s Food program, and 
the New Haven Board of Young Adult Police 
Commissioners. Lillie was also an active 
member of Bible Gospel Church as well as the 
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and served as a 
community assistant for senior citizens. The 
myriad of awards and commendations she re-
ceived over the lifetime are a testament to the 
difference she made in the community and the 
lives of others. 
With her passing, New Haven has lost a 
much cherished and invaluable member of our

mark, not only on the community she called 
home but on the hearts of the thousands 
whose lives she touched. It is my honor to rise 
today to pay tribute to the life of Lillie E. Per-
kins and extend my deepest condolences to 
her daughters, Tiara and Sharon, as well as 
her extended network of family, friends, and 
colleagues. As much as she will be missed, it 
is heartening to know that the legacy of serv-
ice and compassion she leaves will continue

RECOGNIZING MR. ZACK BUTLER 
AS THE SANTA ROSA COUNTY 
TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Mr. Zack Butler as the Santa Rosa 
County Teacher of the Year. For several 
years, Mr. Butler has served Santa Rosa 
County schools with talent, passion, and an 
unwavering commitment to good education. 
In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to 
have some of the best teachers in the Nation. 
It is recognized that the teaching profession is 
one of the most difficult yet rewarding profes-
sions in existence. Mr. Butler has performed 
his teaching duties exceptionally, while also 
going above and beyond to be an asset to his 
school district. 
Mr. Butler’s gifts and talents are used for far 
more than simply educating his students. Mr. 
Butler goes above and beyond to truly teach 
life lessons as well as traditional education, to 
students who have more difficulty learning 
than others; he tailors his lessons and edu-
cational style to fit each individual child. I com-
mend him for his steadfast willingness to 
serve those that matter most—the students 
and youth of our Nation. 
For all of his admirable contributions to our 
community, I am truly proud to have Mr. Butler 
as a constituent in Florida’s First Congres-
sional District. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Mr. Zack Butler for his many accomplish-
ments, and his commitment to excellence, pro-
fessionalism, innovation, and collaboration in 
the Santa Rosa County School District. I thank 
him for his service and wish him all the best 
for his continued success.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
BATTALION CHIEF STEVE WORDEN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Battalion Chief Steve 
Worden of the Dearborn Fire Department on 
the occasion of his retirement. His honorable 
years of service to our community is worthy of 
commendation. 
Battalion Chief Worden began his career at 
the Dearborn Fire Department in April 1997, 
beginning as a Firefighter 1. In 2002, he was 
promoted to Firefighter 2 and then to the role 
of Fire Engineer in 2006. Due to his excel-
lence in service, he was named Lieutenant in 
2006 and then Captain in 2012. He was pro-
moted to his current role as Battalion Chief in 
May 2019. Known for his selflessness, he was 
named Firefighter of the Year by the Service 
Optimist Club in 2012, Department Firefighter 
of the Year in 2012, and Firefighter of The 
Year by the Michigan American Legion in 
2014. He is also the recipient of numerous 
awards, including the Gino Polidori Community 
Service Award and the John D. Dingell Medal 
of Freedom Memorial Commendation. 
An active member of the Dearbon Commu-
nity, Battalion Chief Worden has spent count-
less hours leading the Dearborn Firefighters 
Burn Drive that supports burned and sick chil-
dren throughout Southeast Michigan. He was 
named Chairman of the organization in 2006 
and since then has helped raise hundreds of 
thousands of dollars for burn centers and 
other local groups. As a result of his hard 
work, families have gotten medical equipment, 
food, and clothing that they truly need. He 
continues to reside here in Southeast Michi-
gan with his wife and children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in Battalion Chief Steve Worden for a ca-
reer of exemplary service to the Dearborn Fire 
Department. 
I 
join 
with 
Battalion 
Chief 
Worden’s family, friends, and colleagues in ex-
tending my gratitude to him for his honorable 
service in protecting our community, and thank 
him for his role in serving the people of the 
City of Dearborn for the past three decades.

RECOGNIZING THE BAKERSFIELD 
CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Bakersfield City School 
District as they celebrate the grand opening of 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School. 
Bakersfield City School District was estab-
lished in 1867 with 17 students. Today, it is 
the largest elementary school district in Cali-
fornia and serves over 30,000 students in the 
Central Valley. 
The Bakersfield City School District is a 
model of educational excellence, equity, and 
innovation. They’ve received several awards 
for their work, most recently the silver award 
in the 2022 Magna Awards Program. The 
school district also received the California Ex-
emplary District Award in 2018, 13 Golden 
Bells awarded by the California School Boards 
Association, and seven schools in the district 
received the California Distinguished Schools 
Award. 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary 
School is the 44th school established in the 
Bakersfield City School District. Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. Elementary School uses a 
STEAM-focused educational curriculum. Their 
teaching methods are not only helping stu-
dents prepare for industries of the future like 
engineering, 
technology, 
math, 
art, 
and 
science, but they are helping children of all 
backgrounds access new ways of learning. 
Thanks to the work being done by the teach-
ers and faculty of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
Elementary, the children in our communities 
will be better prepared to tackle the challenges 
of the future, develop new technologies, and 
advance our community forward. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing Bakers-
field City School District and their important 
work to provide high-quality education in the 
Central Valley.

RECOGNIZING 
TAMPA’S 
LOCAL 
TRAILBLAZER, HOWARD A. HAR-
RIS III, IN HONOR OF BLACK HIS-
TORY MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
this Black History Month, I am proud to cele-
brate local trailblazers, and those who dedi-
cate their time and talent to lifting up their 
neighbors. I rise today in immense gratitude of 
Howard A. Harris III, who after a long career 
that took him throughout the country, came 
home to his family to enjoy retirement and 
serve his community by honoring the legacy of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Mr. Harris was born 
in Tampa and his parents, Howard Harris, Jr. 
and Ethel, instilled the importance of edu-
cation. His father, who also served in the U.S. 
Army and attended Howard University on the 
GI Bill, was principal of several elementary 
schools throughout Hillsborough County, and 
Mr. Harris remembers as a young child send-
ing his father off at the airport gate to Colum-
bia University in New York City to receive his 
master’s degree. Mr. Harris is the grandson of 
Marion and Booker T. Washington. He is the 
father of five sons, Dorian, Brian, Michael, 
Johnathan and Stephen. Mr. Harris graduated 
from Jesuit High School and went on to re-
ceive his bachelor’s degree in electrical engi-
neering from Howard University. He also re-
ceived his master’s degree in business admin-
istration from the University of Michigan. 
Mr. Harris worked in the defense, aerospace 
and automotive industries that took him to Los 
Angeles, Orlando, Washington, D.C. and De-
troit. But he always wanted to return to his 
family and the hometown he loves to make a 
positive difference, and he returned to Tampa 
in 2001. In 2021, he retired from IT Manage-
ment with Hillsborough County government 
after 17 years. After serving as president of 
the local chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, 
Mr. Harris turned his attention to honoring the 
legacy of one of his lifelong heroes, Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. When the opportunity arose to 
expand Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. celebra-
tions, Mr. Harris jumped at the chance. For 
decades, City of Tampa and Hillsborough 
County employees supported an annual local 
MLK tribute through a scholarship fund and 
downtown march. Mr. Harris was one of the 
founders that established the MLK Foundation 
to build a family-friendly parade that started in 
2015, fund scholarships for deserving students 
and honor community heroes that uphold the 
legacy of Dr. King. Today, the MLK Founda-
tion hosts one of the largest MLK parades in 
the southeastern United States and engages 
with businesses, community organizations and 
entertainment—over the past few years, nu-
merous bands from Historically Black Colleges

parade. In fact, 2022 was the first time ever 
that the largest HBCU bands in the country, 
Florida’s own Bethune Cookman University 
and Florida A&M University marched together. 
Mr. Harris’ return to Tampa proved invalu-
able to our community and the ideals of edu-
cation and service instilled in him. It was 
where he chose to fulfill the calling for the next 
chapter for his family and continue a life of 
service. Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grate-
ful nation and Tampa Bay community, I am 
proud to recognize the service and leadership 
of Mr. Howard A. Harris III.

RITA LAWRENCE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Rita Lawrence for receiving 
the 2021 Arvada Chamber of Commerce’s 
Chamber Champion Award. 
The Chamber Champion Award is given to 
an organization or individual who has gone 
above and beyond in their support of the Ar-
vada Chamber and who has served as a lead-
er and champion promoting the good work 
and priorities of the Chamber. 
Rita serves in many roles at the Chamber, 
including on its Board of Directors and Execu-
tive Committee, the Networking KAPS Council, 
Annual Dinner Action Team and more. Rita 
has a long tenure as a member of the Cham-
ber joining in 2011 and jumping right in as a 
leader and active volunteer. Rita serves as a 
role model and impressive community leader. 
Her work has benefited the Chamber and the 
business community as a whole. 
Again, congratulations to Rita Lawrence for 
this honor and I thank her for her contribution 
to our community.

TRIBUTE TO THE KIWANIS CLUB 
OF BURBANK 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 100th anniversary of the 
Kiwanis Club of Burbank, California. 
The Kiwanis Club of Burbank, founded in 
1922, is the first and oldest service club in 
Burbank. The mission of Kiwanis Clubs world-
wide is to improve the world one child and one 
community at a time, and to that end, the Bur-
bank club has been faithful to that mission and 
their steadfast commitment to Burbank’s chil-
dren. Their initial service project was paving 
the dirt road in front of Burbank High School. 
The club sponsored one of the first Key Clubs 
at the high school in 1926, and since the 
1920’s, the club has sponsored a Boy Scouts 
of America troop. 
As an all-volunteer organization, the Kiwanis 
Club of Burbank serves the youth of our com-
munity with a vast array of programs, projects, 
youth groups and events; and through these 
many programs and projects, strive to teach 
children leadership skills, good citizenship and 
fostering the spirit of service. Projects include 
many music, drama and art projects in the 
Burbank Unified School District, the Youth 
Leadership Conference, Relay for Life, Bur-
bank Singing Star Contest, YMCA Youth in 
Government, and Kiwanis Cares about Chil-
dren, which helps disaster-stricken families in 
the Burbank area. The club also provides 
youth scholarships and teacher recognition, 
sponsors K-KIDS at the Boys and Girls Club, 
serves meals to seniors, holds food drives for 
food pantries, hosts innovative fundraisers 
such as the Kiwanis Family Fun Day Golf Ball 
Drop, and supports numerous non-profit orga-
nizations such as the Burbank Temporary Aid 
Center, Burbank Kids Community Dental Clin-
ic, and the Burbank YMCA. 
For one hundred years, through world wars 
and the current worldwide pandemic, Kiwanis 
Club of Burbank members have continuously 
provided outstanding service to the commu-
nity, and particularly the children of Burbank, 
California. 
I consider it a great privilege to recognize 
the Kiwanis Club of Burbank and I ask all 
Members to join me in congratulating the club 
upon its centennial anniversary.

IN RECOGNITION OF RARE DIS-
EASE DAY AND THE RARE DIS-
EASE DIVERSITY COALITION 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Rare Disease Day to stand with 
the courageous women and men who have 
been diagnosed with rare diseases and honor 
those who have lost their battle to these ter-
rible illnesses. 
An estimated 1 in 10 Americans are afflicted 
with rare diseases, and people of color suffer 
disproportionately from these illnesses. De-
spite their great overall number, rare disease 
patients are the ‘‘orphans’’ of the healthcare 
systems, often denied diagnosis, treatment, 
and the benefits of research. Due to the low 
prevalence of each disease, medical expertise 
is rare, knowledge is scarce, care offerings in-
adequate, and research limited. 
We applaud the advocates, medical profes-
sionals, and caregivers who dedicate their 
lives to providing resources to those diag-
nosed with rare diseases. One such advocate 
is the Rare Disease Diversity Coalition, an or-
ganization born out of a commitment to help 
address the extraordinary challenges faced by 
rare disease patients of color and a dedication 
to serve as a catalyst for progress. The 
RDDC’s depth and breadth of expertise come 
from the diversity of the over 50 coalition 
members and affiliates; which include the 
Asian-Pacific Islander American Health Forum, 
EveryLife Foundation, Health Equity Collabo-
rative, MANA, A National Latina Organization, 
National Black Nurses Association, National 
Hispanic Medical Association, National Med-
ical Association, Patient Advocate Foundation, 
and the Black Women’s Health Imperative. 
This coalition can help society seize the mo-
mentum for change on racial inequities and 
drive progress on the continuing struggles re-
garding health equity and rare diseases. Last 
fall, the RDDC hosted the RARE Health Equity 
Summit Fall in partnership with Global Genes. 
This Summit brought together stakeholders 
from the rare disease community to discuss 
persistent gaps in diagnostic challenges for 
historically underserved and underrepresented 
patient communities and to align strategies to 
address health inequities of the rare disease 
community. 
It is up to us to continue fighting for cures 
and ensure that every American, especially 
those of color, has access to the quality care 
they need. Still, our Nation has a long way to 
go before rare diseases no longer threaten 
American lives and devastate communities of 
color. 
As we observe Rare Disease Day, I ask my 
colleagues in Congress to stand with me in 
support of real and significant progress with 
rare diseases; to unite in supporting treat-
ments and breakthroughs with rare diseases; 
to ensure that more people have access to 
quality, affordable health care; and to lifting 
the inequitable health burden that falls on 
communities of color. We must commit to end-
ing rare diseases and improving the lives of all 
those affected by these illnesses.

JOHN SELLARS RETIREMENT 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the long and storied career of John 
Sellars, Executive Director of the History Mu-
seum on the Square. 
A native of Springfield, Missouri, John has 
always held a special place in his heart for the 
Ozarks. Even when his job took him away 
from his hometown, he remained loyal to the 
community. He originally volunteered at the 
History Museum on the Square when it first 
opened in 1976, and he continued to help until 
he moved in 1989. He was working at Coca- 
Cola at the time, but later moved onto Canada 
Dry. He eventually got a job with Pepsi and 
retired from there as a Regional Manager in 
2004. Work had moved him all over the coun-
try, but in retirement, he came back to Spring-
field, and almost immediately returned to the 
History Museum on the Square. He joined the 
board of directors, before being elected board 
president, and eventually became the Execu-
tive Director of the museum in 2005. 
The History Museum on the Square is a 
natural fit for John. He has a true love of his-
tory, and especially the history of Springfield. 
He passionately shares this history through his 
work at the museum. Not only that, but John 
has also been involved in several other char-
ities throughout his life, constantly finding 
ways to give back to his community. 
Madam Speaker, John Sellars has lived an 
incredible life, and since retiring from Pepsi, 
has spent his time giving back to his commu-
nity. I wish him and his family all the best as 
he retires from the History Museum on the 
Square.
