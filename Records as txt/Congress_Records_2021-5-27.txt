Let us pray. 
Eternal God, hear our prayers and be 
merciful to us. We find protection in 
the shadow of Your wings. Our longings 
lie open before You. You know the de-
sires of our hearts. 
Sanctify the motives of our law-

Lord, deliver them from the deceptive

Do not leave or forsake us, for You 
are the hope for our tomorrows. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEM-
PORE. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate opens this morning after a 
very late night of amendment votes on 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act—USICA; those are the initials— 
five in total, four of which of these 
amendments were sponsored by Repub-
licans. So far on this bill, the Senate 
has held votes on no fewer than 18 
amendments, 4 from Democrats and 14 
from Republicans, and there are more 
to come. 
As I mentioned yesterday, in a land-
mark moment for bipartisanship in the 
Senate, we even adopted an amend-
ment from Senator RAND
PAUL
by 
voice vote. Yes, that is right. I said the 
two words together. RAND PAUL; voice 
vote—four words. I said the two con-
cepts 
together: 
RAND
PAUL; 
voice 
vote—four words. 
Now, the media will tell you that if 
you are talking process, you are losing, 
but the process was really important 
here. For years, Senators have been 
clamoring for a more open process and 
more amendment votes. I can’t tell you 
how many speeches I have heard on the 
floor about the virtues of regular order. 
Well, this competition bill ought to be 
the answer to my colleagues’ prayers. 
The bill has moved through regular 
order, flying through various Senate 
committees with staggering bipartisan 
votes. The entire Senate opted to take 
up the bill by a vote of 86 to 11. 
Here on the floor, we have held the 
kind of vigorous, bipartisan, open 
amendment process that Senators have 
been calling for. Some of these votes 
were tough for our side. In the old 
days, we would have said no. We said 
yes, we will vote for them, but let’s 
keep moving forward, and we are. 
Listen to this. It is only May, rough-
ly 5 months since Democrats took the 
majority in this Chamber, and already 
more amendments have received roll-
call votes than during any of the past 
4 years. Let me repeat that so people 
hear it from one end of the Capitol to 
the other, particularly on this side of 
the aisle. In 5 months, more amend-
ments have received rollcall votes in 
this Democrat-led Senate than during 
any of the years in which Donald 
Trump was President and Senator 
MCCONNELL was majority leader. 
We have considered the competition 
bill in an exceedingly bipartisan way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3548 
May 27, 2021 
There will be a few final steps to take, 
a few final amendments to consider, 
but I hope my Republican colleagues 
have seen our commitment to devel-
oping, drafting, and perfecting this leg-
islation in total concert with the other 
side of the aisle. 
With cooperation from our Repub-
lican colleagues, we can finish the bill 
today, and I hope we do. That is our in-
tention, because despite the lack of at-
tention it has garnered from the press, 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act will be one of the most significant 
pieces of bipartisan legislation we pass 
in a very long time. It could be a mo-
ment in history that future genera-
tions look back on as a turning point 
for American leadership in the 21st 
century. 
Everyone knows the Federal Govern-
ment’s commitment to science and 
technology has been slipping for dec-
ades. We have become complacent at 
the top of the global heap, and our po-
sition as the world’s economic leader is 
teetering. We now spend less than 1 
percent of our GDP on basic scientific 
research. 
The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party, as a percentage, spends more 
than twice that. We have put ourselves 
in the very precarious position of po-
tentially falling behind the rest of the 
world in technologies and industries 
that will define the next century. If 
that happens, the days of America 
leading the world in scientific innova-
tion and the days of America being the 
leading economic and military power 
in the world may be over. 
This is a moment when the U.S. Sen-
ate can arrest the decline and lay the 
foundation, instead, for another Amer-
ican century. That is why this is a mo-
ment in history that future genera-
tions could well look back on as a turn-
ing point for American leadership in 
the 21st century. 
By investing in science and tech-
nology and shoring up critical indus-
tries like semiconductors, boosting our 
universities, laboratories, and busi-
nesses, we can keep America on top 
and outcompete the world in industries 
of the future. That is just what this 
legislation would do. Our two parties 
have worked very hard on it. I think 
we have made a number of notable im-
provements to the bill. It is time to 
move forward together and pass this 
bill. 
f 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, on another matter that should 
also be just as bipartisan in the Senate: 
the Commission to investigate the Jan-
uary 6 attack on the Capitol. 
We all know that January 6 was one 
of the lowest moments in our democ-
racy and one of the lowest moments in 
the grand, grand history of our 200-and- 
some-odd-year experiment—noble ex-
periment—in democracy. An outgoing 
President of the United States, fresh 
off an electoral defeat—a significant 
electoral defeat—did something that no 
other President in recent history has 
done. Rather than accept the results of 
the election and support the peaceful 
transfer of power—a hallmark of our 
democracy that has inspired democ-
racies all over the world—former Presi-
dent Trump unabashedly lied, repeat-
edly, about the results of the election 
and fomented an armed rebellion at the 
U.S. Capitol. 
We are all witnesses to those events. 
We all heard the lies. We lived through 
their terrible consequences. Lest we 
forget, 140 police officers were injured 
in the attack, and 5 Americans would 
eventually lose their lives. 
In the weeks since, faith in our elec-
tions has plummeted. More than half of 
the Republican Party now believes that 
the 2020 elections were rigged and that 
Joe Biden isn’t the actual President of 
the United States. Republican State 
legislatures across the country, cap-
tured by Donald Trump’s Big Lie, are 
tripping over themselves to restrict ac-
cess to the ballot box. Arizona Repub-
licans, in an ‘‘election audit,’’ have 
been searching for traces of bamboo fi-
bers in the 2020 ballots—chasing a ba-
nanas-crazy, rightwing internet con-
spiracy that China had ballots im-
ported to tip the scales for Biden. That 
is how insane this has become—hunt-
ing for bamboo in ballots. 
We need to put a stop to this cancer 
in the Republican Party. We need to 
stand up to the Big Lie. We must get at 
the truth and do everything in our 
power to restore Americans’ faith in 
our elections and this grand, ongoing, 
noble experiment of democracy. 
In that light, a national, bipartisan, 
independent Commission to report on 
the events of January 6 is exactly what 
the doctor ordered. We have to inves-
tigate, expose, and report on the truth. 
We need to establish a trusted record of 
what really transpired on January 6 
and the events that preceded it. That is 
what this Commission is designed to do 
in a bipartisan, straight-down-the-mid-
dle manner. 
Now, I have gone through all the 
silly excuses that we have heard from 
our Republican colleagues about why 
the Commission isn’t needed or is too 
early or will go on for too long or needs 
to be modeled after the 9/11 Commis-
sion, even though it already is. The 
truth of the matter seems to be that 
Senate Republicans oppose the Com-
mission because they fear that it might 
upset Donald Trump and their party’s 
midterm messaging. 
I am not speculating. It was reported 
in POLITICO yesterday that the Sen-
ate Republican leader warned his Con-
ference that a January 6 Commission 
could hurt the Republicans politically. 
Well, too bad. This is too important. 
For the sake of Americans’ faith in 
our democracy, there must be a full, 
thorough, and trusted account of what 
happened on January 6. Senate Repub-
licans must decide if they are on the 
side of truth or on the side of Donald 
Trump’s Big Lie. 
I yield the floor. 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nomination: Cal-
endar No. 135; that the nomination be 
confirmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action; and that the Sen-
ate then resume legislative session. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The nomination considered and con-
firmed is as follows: 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
Christine Elizabeth Wormuth, of Virginia, 
to be Secretary of the Army, vice Ryan 
McCarthy. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senate will now resume leg-
islative session. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
PUBLIC SAFETY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
from coast to coast, American families 
are facing an explosion of violent crime 
on their streets and in their neighbor-
hoods. The year 2020 saw homicides 
skyrocket nationwide—the sharpest 1- 
year increase in decades—and 2021 is al-
ready shaping up to be even worse. 
Last year, Seattle saw a 61-percent 
increase in murders citywide. In 2020, 
Minneapolis saw homicides hit levels 
not seen since the 1990s, and, so far, 
2021 is about doubling last year’s pace. 
Here in Washington, DC, 2020 saw 
homicides hit a 16-year high, and, 
again, 2021 is already on an even worse 
trajectory. The situation is devolving 
all across the country. In my home-
town of Louisville, as one report put it: 
‘‘[T]he number of slayings in 2020 
dwarf[ed] 
anything 
Louisville 
has 
seen—obliterating 
the 
previous 
record.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3549 
May 27, 2021 
Crime and delinquency have many 
causes. In some ways, the pandemic 
likely contributed, but it is impossible 
to ignore that these terrible trends are 
coming precisely as so-called ‘‘progres-
sives’’ have decided it is time to de-
nounce and defund local law enforce-
ment. Seattle, for example, cut police 
funding by 20 percent. Minneapolis 
defunded cops by millions of dollars. 
The District of Columbia’s city council 
approved $15 million in cuts. These 
boneheaded decisions are the direct re-
sult of an anti-law enforcement fad 
that has swept through the political 
left like a wildfire. 
Perhaps just as important as these 
funding cuts is the wave of hostile sen-
timent that has come with them. Har-
vard scholars have found that, after 
high-profile incidents reduce the trust 
that the public and politicians put in 
the police, the cities in question re-
ceive less active policing and, subse-
quently, see an increase in crime, in-
cluding homicides. 
In other words, in the wake of ter-
rible incidents like we saw last sum-
mer, local leaders should look for ways 
to build bridges and rebuild trust be-
tween the vast majority of brave and 
honorable officers and their commu-
nities. 
Oh, no. Instead, from city councils to 
the Halls of Congress, many on the far 
left decided to crank the knob all the 
way up on anti-cop rhetoric all across 
the board: 
Not only do we need to disinvest from po-
lice but we need to completely dismantle the 
Minneapolis Police Department. 
Policing in our country is inherently and 
intentionally racist . . . No more policing, 
incarceration, and militarization. 
Incredulous people asked whether 
this nonsense was ever meant seri-
ously. 
Helpfully, one Member of Congress 
clarified: 
‘‘Defunding 
police 
means 
defunding police.’’ 
That is a clarifying comment. 
A small set of politicians may see 
selfish opportunities for fame or fund-
raising if they defame and defund the 
police, but American families are pay-
ing a deadly price. 
Defunding the police isn’t just a ter-
rible idea for overall public safety; it is 
also a uniquely awful strategy for ra-
cial justice. One study recently con-
firmed: ‘‘Larger police forces save 
lives, and the lives saved are dispropor-
tionately Black lives.’’ 
So, look. I am not sure exactly how 
the rantings of far-left Twitter about 
crime and policing became official 
Democratic Party dogma in so many 
places across America. What I do know 
is that ordinary Americans cannot bear 
much more of this, and that goes dou-
ble for the most vulnerable neighbor-
hoods. 
f 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, last week, the Sen-
ate took up sweeping legislation that 
touches on big issues that span many 
committees—from economic policy to 
national security, to scientific re-
search, and beyond. 
Eighty-six Senators voted to proceed 
to this debate, me included. That 
wasn’t because the legislation was 
ready to go. It happened because there 
is broad bipartisan agreement that 
America needs to upgrade our competi-
tiveness with China. There was broad 
agreement that this subject deserved a 
robust debate and amendment process. 
Since then we have voted on some 
amendments, but as of this moment, 
the Senate’s bipartisan work is simply 
not completed. 
The Democratic leader indicated that 
if the chairman and ranking members 
worked together, if committees put 
their heads together, their work would 
get consideration out here on the floor. 
Well, Chairman WYDEN and Ranking 
Member CRAPO of the Finance Com-
mittee have a bipartisan provision that 
is ready to go. They have already done 
the hard work. They have reached a so-
lution, but thus far the Democratic 
leader has refused to include it in his 
substitute and has not allowed the Sen-
ate to vote on it separately. 
These are long-term issues we are 
considering. We need to get this right. 
And during the time this legislation 
has been on the floor, we have had en-
tire days come and go without any 
votes at all on the bill. 
In several instances, the Democratic 
leader chose to pivot away from this 
legislation and devote floor time to 
nominations. 
So there is no excuse for shutting off 
debate prematurely before the Senate 
has been able to have its say. 
So we will have to see how today 
unfolds, what additional amendments 
the Democratic leader lets the Senate 
consider, how open a process he per-
mits. 
Republicans don’t want some big 
fight over this. We would like to see an 
outcome—a bipartisan outcome. Even 
now, discussions are continuing behind 
the scenes. 
But the Democratic leader should not 
try to force a cloture vote prematurely 
to stifle the Senate before Members are 
satisfied that our work is finished. 
There is nothing unusual about a mi-
nority party denying cloture to secure 
more amendment votes. I have been 
here a while. This happens all the time. 
Six years ago, even after about two 
dozen amendment votes, Democrats 
blocked cloture on a Keystone Pipeline 
bill until the Senate took a dozen more 
amendment votes on top of that. 
Just last year, even as the economy 
was tanking around us, the Democratic 
leader blocked cloture multiple times 
on the CARES Act—emergency legisla-
tion. Why? He wanted more changes. 
But I hope it doesn’t come to that 
today. I hope the Democratic leader 
lets the Senate be the Senate so we can 
finish this important legislation. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now one final matter. As my colleagues 
know, I have been clear and unflinch-
ing in my own statements about Janu-
ary 6. But as I have also repeated, 
there is no new fact about that day we 
need the Democrats’ extraneous Com-
mission to uncover. 
The Department of Justice is deep 
into a massive criminal investigation. 
Four hundred and forty-plus people 
have already been arrested. Hundreds— 
hundreds—have been charged. Even 
more arrests are said to be planned. 
And the Attorney General indicates 
this investigation will remain a top 
focus. Multiple Senate committees are 
conducting their own bipartisan inquir-
ies. And, obviously, the role of the 
former President has already been liti-
gated 
exhaustively—exhaustively—in 
the high-profile impeachment trial we 
had right here in the Senate several 
months ago. 
I do not believe the additional extra-
neous Commission that Democratic 
leaders want would uncover crucial 
new facts or promote healing. Frankly, 
I do not believe it is even designed to 
do that. 
That is why the Speaker’s first draft 
began with a laughably rigged and par-
tisan starting point and why the cur-
rent language would still lock in sig-
nificant unfairness under the hood. 
So I will continue to support the 
real, serious work of our criminal jus-
tice system and our own Senate com-
mittees, and I will continue to urge my 
colleagues to oppose this extraneous 
layer when the time comes for the Sen-
ate to vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3550 
May 27, 2021 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
AUTOMATED VEHICLES 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, from 
the beginning, the story of the U.S. 
auto industry has been one of inge-
nuity, of taking risks, and of pushing 
forward. 
At the dawn of the 20th century, 
most Americans could hardly com-
prehend the idea of the automobile. 
Yet, 20 years later, they had become 
nearly ubiquitous in American life, 
thanks to the insistence of entre-
preneurs like Henry Ford on making 
the automobile affordable for the ma-
jority of Americans. 
The democratization of the auto-
mobile, rather than the invention of 
the automobile itself, is, in my opin-
ion, one of most remarkable and 
uniquely American success stories. 
Automobiles allowed Americans to 
capitalize on the economic dynamism 
of the roaring twenties and helped 
Americans move and adapt during the 
Great Depression. 
They contributed greatly to the 
American 
industrial 
base 
and 
the 
know-how needed to fight and win the 
Second World War and help propel the 
United States to its current status as a 
preeminent global economic and mili-
tary power. 
Visionary investments like the Inter-
state Highway System made cars a sta-
ple in American economic and cultural 
life. And cars certainly made it a lot 
easier to get to and from rural Amer-
ica. In a place like rural South Dakota, 
with limited public transportation, the 
automobile, often a pickup or an SUV, 
is typically the only way to get 
around. 
Today, 
the 
automobile 
industry 
stands on the brink of a new techno-
logical revolution, which promises to 
dramatically transform mobility once 
again. 
Over the past three decades, the 
internet has transformed our economy 
and our way of life, and the next gen-
eration of the internet, 5G, which is 
currently being deployed across the 
Nation, will enable a host of new inno-
vations, including a revolution in vehi-
cle technology: automated vehicles or 
what we call AVs. 
AVs will change the way that we 
move in numerous ways, making the 
transportation system safer, more effi-
cient, and more accessible. 
Individuals whose mobility is cur-
rently limited, for example, Americans 
with disabilities, could gain new inde-
pendence with the deployment of auto-
mated vehicles, allowing them to work 
or visit friends and family safely and 
easily. 
I am proud that my proposed AV 
amendment to the Endless Frontier 
Act was recently endorsed by the Na-
tional Federation of the Blind, and I 
ask for unanimous consent that the 
letter of endorsement be inserted in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
NATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND, 
May 11, 2021. 
Hon. MARIA CANTWELL, 
Chair, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, 
Science, & Transportation, Washington, 
DC. 
Hon. ROGER WICKER, 
Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
& 
Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR CANTWELL AND RANKING MEM-
BER WICKER: The National Federation of the 
Blind, the nation’s transformative civil 
rights organization of the blind, supports 
and endorses the amendment to the Endless 
Frontier Act filed with the committee by 
Senator Thune on May 10, 2021. Specifically, 
we support the portions of the amendment 
that will create an exemption classification 
for manufacturers who provide transpor-
tation access for people with disabilities and 
prohibit discriminatory licensing practices 
for highly automated vehicles. 
Subsection (d)(2)(C) of the amendment 
would create an exemption category under 
the federal motor vehicle safety standards 
located in Section 30113 of title 49 United 
States Code that would ‘‘provide transpor-
tation access for individuals with disabil-
ities, including non-visual access for individ-
uals who are blind or visually impaired.’’ 
This addition to the law will provide the in-
centive needed for automobile manufactur-
ers to ensure that the unique requirements 
for Americans with disabilities to be able to 
operate automated vehicles are considered in 
the early stages of development. 
Subsection (e)(3) of the amendment would 
mandate that a state ‘‘may not issue a motor 
vehicle operator’s license for the operation 
or use of a highly automated vehicle in a 
manner that discriminates on the basis of 
disability.’’ This will ensure that current re-
quirements necessary to obtain a driver’s li-
cense, like a vision test, will not be required 
in order to operate or use a highly auto-
mated vehicle. We are pleased to see this 
subsection included in the amendment be-
cause highly automated vehicles will pilot 
themselves (SAE Level 4 and Level 5), mak-
ing a vision requirement arbitrary and dis-
criminatory. 
Highly automated vehicles have the poten-
tial to revolutionize the transportation land-
scape, especially for individuals with disabil-
ities. However, those same individuals with 
disabilities who stand to gain the most from 
the creation and proliferation of highly auto-
mated vehicles could be left out of this new 
frontier if specific actions are not taken. 
Senator Thune’s amendment to the Endless 
Frontier Act is an important step to ensure 
that America’s journey toward automotive 
automation is fully inclusive of those who 
will benefit most. 
Sincerely, 
MARK A. RICCOBONO, 
President. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, imag-
ine a farmer in rural South Dakota 
who can no longer drive to get to town 
for appointments, prescriptions, or gro-
ceries—enter the automated vehicle. 
This technology has potential to 
keep people in their homes and com-
munities longer. 
Moreover, AVs have potential to 
greatly increase roadway safety. Cur-
rently, there are an average of more 
than 35,000 traffic fatalities on our Na-
tion’s roadways each year, including 
pedestrian, motorcycle, and bicycle fa-
talities. Automated vehicles could dra-
matically—dramatically—reduce 
that 
number. Distracted driving, driving 
while 
impaired—automated 
vehicles 
could eliminate those dangers. 
For automated vehicle technology to 
advance, it is imperative that the regu-
latory framework catch up with pri-
vate-sector innovation. That is why I 
have pushed for the enactment of AV 
legislation over the years and why I 
had hoped—I had hoped—that we would 
be voting to add my automated vehi-
cles amendment to the legislation be-
fore the Senate today. 
I have spent nearly 5 years—5 years— 
working in a bipartisan manner on a 
legislative framework to govern the 
testing and deployment of automated 
vehicles. The amendment I offered to 
the bill before us today is an amend-
ment that I had hoped to be able to 
offer with bipartisan support. It would 
have paved the way for expanded test-
ing and deployment of automated vehi-
cles in the United States under the 
oversight of the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration. 
And let me emphasize that oversight 
point. My amendment would ensure 
that automated vehicles would not— 
not—touch pavement without the Na-
tional Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration’s certification that they are 
at least as safe as a conventional vehi-
cle. The data gathered from the vehi-
cles deployed as a result of this amend-
ment would be crucial to the develop-
ment of future motor vehicle safety 
standards for AVs. 
Unfortunately, bipartisan agreement 
on my amendment collapsed when spe-
cial interests expressed their opposi-
tion, despite major efforts to accom-
modate their concerns. And I am deep-
ly 
disappointed 
that, 
once 
again, 
Democrats yielded to pressure from 
special interests against the best inter-
ests of our economy and the American 
people. 
Advancing AV technology is not just 
a vehicle safety issue. It is also an 
issue of U.S. leadership and global com-
petitiveness. Investing in the produc-
tion of AV technology here in the 
United States would not only strength-
en the resilience of the auto industry 
but also the Nation’s industrial base 
and our national security. 
The auto industry touches nearly 
every American State. For example, 
Horton in Britton, SD, manufactures 
engine 
cooling 
systems, 
providing 
steady, good paying jobs for that com-
munity and strengthening the local 
economy. The same story repeats itself 
countless times in communities all 
across the Nation. 
Providing millions of jobs and invest-
ing billions annually, the American 
auto industry is a critical component 
of the nation’s economy. Right now,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3551 
May 27, 2021 
U.S. companies lead the world in AV 
technology, but other nations, like 
China, are seizing upon regulatory in-
action and striving to take the lead. If 
we don’t move forward with automated 
vehicle technology, we will soon see 
some other nation leading the AV revo-
lution. 
The legislative package before us 
today is designed to bolster the global 
competitiveness of the United States. 
It is pretty difficult to understand 
why this reasonable and, I might add, 
no cost AV amendment that would lead 
to untold benefits for our Nation’s 
transportation system, does not fit in. 
How can a bill making strong invest-
ments in artificial intelligence, quan-
tum computing, and advanced manu-
facturing exclude a legislative frame-
work for AVs? 
Are we really going to back down 
from leading the world in automated 
innovation and technology and cede 
the future of this industry to nations 
like China? Will we really ignore the 
enormous—enormous—safety 
benefits 
of these vehicles just to suit Demo-
crats’ political convenience? 
More than a century ago, when the 
automobile was invented, there were 
plenty of skeptics, but America’s auto-
mobile pioneers did not let that stop 
them. They seized the moment and 
pressed forward and ushered in a trans-
portation revolution. We can do that 
again today or we can cede this mo-
ment to nations like China and let the 
American automobile industry fall per-
manently behind. That is the choice in 
front of us. I hope we will choose to 
seize this moment and pass the legisla-
tion we need to usher in another Amer-
ican transportation revolution. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

lowing findings: 
(A) The People’s Republic of China is the 
global leader in mining, refining, and compo-
nent manufacturing of rare earth elements, 
producing approximately 85 percent of the 
world’s supply between 2011 and 2017. 
(B) In 2019, the United States imported an 
estimated 80 percent of its rare earth com-
pounds from the People’s Republic of China. 
(C) On March 26, 2014, the World Trade Or-
ganization ruled that the People’s Republic 
of China’s export restraints on rare earth 
minerals violated its obligations under its 
protocol of accession to the World Trade Or-
ganization, thereby harming United States 
manufacturers and workers. 
(D) The Chinese Communist Party has 
threatened to leverage the People’s Republic 
of China’s dominant position in the rare 
earth market to ‘‘strike back’’ at the United 
States. 
(E) The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue is 
an effective partnership for reliable multi-
lateral financing, development, and distribu-
tion of goods for global consumption, as evi-
denced by the Quad Vaccine Partnership an-
nounced on March 12, 2021. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(A) the People’s Republic of China’s domi-
nant share of the global rare earth mining 
market is a threat to the economic stability, 
well being, and competitiveness of key in-
dustries in the United States; 
(B) the United States should reduce reli-
ance on the People’s Republic of China for 
rare earth minerals through— 
(i) strategic investments in development 
projects, production technologies, and refin-
ing facilities in the United States; or 
(ii) in partnership with strategic allies of 
the United States that are reliable trading 
partners, including members of the Quad-
rilateral Security Dialogue; and 
(C) the United States Trade Representative 
should initiate multilateral talks among the 
countries of the Quadrilateral Security Dia-
logue to promote shared investment and de-
velopment of rare earth minerals. 
(b) REPORT REQUIRED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 120 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the United States Trade Representative, in 
consultation with the officials specified in 
paragraph (3), shall submit to the appro-
priate committees of Congress a report on 
the work of the Trade Representative to ad-
dress the national security threat posed by 
the People’s Republic of China’s control of 
nearly 2⁄3 of the global supply of rare earth 
minerals.

paragraph (1) shall include— 
(A) a description of the extent of the en-
gagement of the United States with the 
other countries of the Quadrilateral Security 
Dialogue to promote shared investment and

actment of this Act and ending on the date 
of the report; and

FROM
DU-
TIES.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Subject to subsection 
(d), the Trade Representative shall establish 
and maintain a process for exclusion re-
quests from duties under section 301(b) un-
less the Trade Representative determines 
and certifies to the appropriate congres-

clusion process— 
‘‘(A) would impair the ability of the United

move unreasonable or discriminatory prac-
tices burdening commerce in the United 
States; or 
‘‘(B) is impractical due to the low value of 
the duties imposed.

tification, the Trade Representative shall 
brief the appropriate congressional commit-

ESS.—

clusion process required under subsection 
(b)(1), the Trade Representative shall con-
sider whether and which criteria described in

‘‘(2) CRITERIA DESCRIBED.—The criteria de-
scribed in this paragraph for exclusion of ar-
ticles from duties under section 301(b) in-
clude the following:

clusion would result in severe economic 
harm to the requester. 
‘‘(B) Whether the article or a reasonable 
substitute is not commercially available to 
the requester. 
‘‘(C) Whether the imposition of the duty 
with respect to the article would unreason-
ably increase consumer prices for day-to-day 
items consumed by low- or middle-income 
families in the United States. 
‘‘(D) Whether the imposition of the duty 
would have an unreasonable impact on man-
ufacturing output of the United States. 
‘‘(E) Whether the imposition of the duty 
would have an unreasonable impact on the 
ability of an entity to fulfill contracts or to 
build critical infrastructure. 
‘‘(F) Whether the failure to grant the ex-
clusion is likely to result in a particular en-
tity or entities having the ability to abuse a 
dominant market position. 
‘‘(d) EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DUTIES.—This 
section shall not apply to duties imposed 
under section 301(b) pursuant to a dispute 
resolution process under the World Trade Or-
ganization.

OF NOTICE.—Subject to 
subsection (d), not later than 90 days after 
imposing any duty under section 301(b), the 
Trade Representative, in consultation with 
such other Federal agencies as the Trade 
Representative considers appropriate, shall 
publish a notice in the Federal Register re-
garding the criteria that the Trade Rep-
resentative will apply and the evidence it 
will evaluate in determining whether a re-
quest for exclusion from such duty satisfies 
the requirements of the exclusion process 
under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
‘‘(1) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘appropriate congressional 
committees’ means— 
‘‘(A) the Committee on Finance of the Sen-
ate; and 
‘‘(B) the Committee on Ways and Means of 
the House of Representatives. 
‘‘(2) SEVERE ECONOMIC HARM.—The term ‘se-
vere economic harm’, with respect to an ex-
clusion from duties requested by a United 
States entity, includes circumstances under 
which failure to grant the exclusion would—

portion of the workers employed by the enti-
ty becoming totally separated from employ-
ment. 
‘‘(3) SMALL ENTITIES.—The term ‘small en-
tities’ has the meaning given the term ‘small 
entity’ in section 601 of title 5, United States

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3568 
May 27, 2021 
(1) 
IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding 
any 
other provision of law, the United States 
Trade Representative shall establish a proc-
ess pursuant to which United States entities 
and associations of those entities may re-
quest the exclusion of articles from duties 
described in paragraph (2). 
(2) DUTIES
DESCRIBED.—The duties de-
scribed in this paragraph are duties imposed 
pursuant to the investigation initiated under 
section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 
2411) on August 18, 2017, and with respect to 
which notice was published in the Federal 
Register on August 24, 2017 (82 Fed. Reg. 
40213). 
(3) IMPLEMENTATION
OF
EXCLUSION
PROC-
ESS.—In implementing the process estab-
lished under paragraph (1) for exclusion of 
articles from duties described in paragraph 
(2), if the exclusion of the article can likely 
be administered by U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection— 
(A) the Trade Representative shall exclude 
that article from the imposition of such a 
duty if the Trade Representative determines, 
following a request from a United States en-
tity or an association of those entities, that 
the failure to grant the exclusion would re-
sult in severe economic harm to the re-
quester; 
(B) unless the Trade Representative deter-
mines that granting the exclusion would im-
pair the ability of the United States to main-
tain effective pressure to remove an unrea-
sonable or discriminatory practice burdening 
United States commerce, the Trade Rep-
resentative shall exclude that article from 
the imposition of such a duty if the Trade 
Representative determines following a re-
quest from a United States entity or an asso-
ciation of those entities that— 
(i) the article or a reasonable substitute is 
not commercially available to the requester; 
(ii) the imposition of the duty with respect 
to the article would unreasonably increase 
consumer prices for day-to-day items con-
sumed by low- or middle-income families in 
the United States; 
(iii) the imposition of the duty would have 
an unreasonable impact on manufacturing 
output of the United States; 
(iv) the imposition of the duty would have 
an unreasonable impact on the ability of an 
entity to fulfill contracts or to build critical 
infrastructure; or 
(v) the failure to grant the exclusion is 
likely to result in a particular entity or enti-
ties having the ability to abuse a dominant 
market position; and 
(C) the Trade Representative may identify 
other 
criteria 
relevant 
to 
determining 
whether the article shall be excluded from 
the imposition of such a duty. 
(4) TIMEFRAME
OF
EXCLUSION
AND
RE-
NEWAL.— 
(A) PERIOD OF EXCLUSION.—An exclusion of 
an article requested under paragraph (1)

to be paid. 
(B) RENEWAL.—The Trade Representative 
shall allow applications for renewal of an ex-
clusion under paragraph (1) to be submitted

TO
ACT.—If the Trade Rep-
resentative fails to decide an exclusion re-
quest under subparagraph (A)(ii) during the 
appropriate period set forth under that sub-
paragraph, the exclusion request will be 
deemed to have been granted until the date 
that is 30 days after the Trade Representa-
tive publishes in the Federal Register a deci-
sion not to grant the request. 
(5) WRITTEN REASONING.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—If the Trade Representa-
tive denies a request for an exclusion under 
paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall

tion under subparagraph (A) shall be sup-
ported by substantial evidence from the ad-
ministrative record.

OF
AUDIT.—Each audit re-
quired by subparagraph (A) shall—

clusion; and 
(IV) 
making 
determinations 
regarding 
whether to grant an exclusion; 
(ii) examine the information provided to 
applicants prior to seeking an exclusion, as 
well as throughout the exclusion application

an exclusion request under paragraph (1). 
(B) SEVERE
ECONOMIC
HARM.—The Trade 
Representative shall prescribe regulations 
regarding the definition of severe economic 
harm under paragraph (8), including by set-
ting forth the evidence necessary to estab-
lish that a business is unprofitable, that 
workers will be separated, and other cir-
cumstances in which severe economic harm 
may be demonstrated.

SEC. 73006. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LEADER-
SHIP AT WORLD TRADE ORGANIZA-
TION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The United States had led the forma-
tion, as well as reform, of rules governing 
the multilateral trading system since World 
War II. 
(2) The United States is a founding member 
of the World Trade Organization (in this sec-
tion referred to as the ‘‘WTO’’) and a key ar-
chitect of the organization. 
(3) The United States secured important 
commitments in the WTO to facilitate trade 
in goods and services, to prevent the applica-
tion of non-scientific restrictions on United 
States agriculture, and to protect United 
States intellectual property. 
(4) The United States uses the rules of the 
WTO to benefit workers, farmers, fishers, 
and businesses in the United States by facili-
tating access to the 90 percent of the world’s 
consumers who live outside the borders of 
the United States. 
(5) The fundamental purpose of the WTO is 
to create space for members to negotiate 
with each other, and the WTO reserves to 
those members exclusively the right to nego-
tiate and adopt rules that reduce and elimi-
nate trade barriers and discriminatory treat-
ment. 
(6) The prompt settlement of disputes in 
which a member of the WTO considers that 
its rights are being impaired by the actions 
of another member is essential to the func-
tioning of the WTO and the maintenance of

a proper balance between the rights and obli-
gations of members. 
(7) The WTO’s dispute settlement function, 
including in particular the Appellate Body, 
has increasingly failed to enforce the rules of 
the WTO in a timely manner, and has 
usurped the negotiating prerogative of mem-
bers by creating new obligations and rights 
that are inconsistent with or not included in 
the rules negotiated by members. 
(8) The creation of those obligations and 
rights undermines— 
(A) the WTO’s negotiating function by dis-
couraging members from making conces-
sions; and 
(B) the WTO’s dispute settlement function 
by encouraging overuse of the process and 
undermining its legitimacy, including by 
preventing free market economies from re-
sponding to globally trade distortive prac-
tices by nonmarket economies. 
(9) The WTO does not have sufficient rules 
to discipline the distortive economic policies 
of nonmarket economies, such as policies re-
lating to excess capacity and forced tech-
nology transfer, the special treatment those 
economies afford to state-owned enterprises, 
and their massive and opaque industrial sub-
sidies. 
(10) There is long-standing bipartisan sup-
port in Congress to reform the WTO to ad-
dress those failings. 
(11) The current presidential administra-
tion, as well as prior administrations, raised 
concerns about the failings described in this 
subsection and have made reform of the WTO 
a top priority of United States trade policy. 
(12) The United States urges WTO members 
to work constructively with the United 
States to assess the reasons why the existing 
WTO rules have proven inadequate in order 
to create an atmosphere within the WTO 
that is conducive to the development of new 
rules less subject to jurisprudential drift. 
(13) The guiding principle for reform of the 
WTO, and the lens through which WTO mem-
bers should consider specific reform pro-
posals, is the restoration of the WTO’s capa-
bility and capacity for negotiation among 
members. 
(14) The United States has achieved its 
trade policy objectives through active lead-
ership at the WTO, and an absence of that 
leadership would be filled by nonmarket 
economies that are hostile to a host of 
United States interests. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) while the United States finds value and 
usefulness in the WTO, in order to fulfill the 
needs of the United States and other free and 
open economies in the 21st century, signifi-
cant reforms are needed; 
(2) the United States must therefore con-
tinue to demonstrate leadership to achieve 
reforms that restore the effectiveness of the 
WTO’s— 
(A) negotiating function; 
(B) dispute settlement function so that it 
transparently, efficiently, and fully enforces 
outcomes negotiated by members rather 
than usurping their primacy by creating new 
rights or obligations; and 
(C) rules for special and differential treat-
ment to ensure those rules promote advance-
ment for truly developing countries, rather 
than becoming tools for globally competitive 
countries, like the People’s Republic of 
China, to engage in protectionism and mar-
ket distortions; 
(3) the efforts to reform the negotiating 
function of the WTO should revitalize the ne-
gotiating function by providing confidence 
to members that the WTO operates accord-
ing to the rules as negotiated and adopted by 
members; 
(4) a revitalized negotiating function must 
include new rules that reflect the 21st cen-
tury economy, further combat anticompeti-
tive and protectionist barriers, and ensure 
disputes are efficiently resolved; 
(5) the United States Trade Representative 
should continue to lead efforts to work with 
WTO members to pursue reforms at the WTO 
that— 
(A) ensure the dispute settlement mecha-
nism faithfully applies the rules adopted by 
members, including by undertaking meas-
ures to ensure the WTO’s Appellate Body 
does not create new rights and obligations; 
(B) improve public confidence in dispute 
settlement by promoting greater trans-
parency and efficiency in the conduct of pro-
ceedings; 
(C) redress the consistent failure by cer-
tain members to satisfy their notification 
obligations under various WTO agreements, 
including through measures that strengthen 
accountability; 
(D) ensure rules for special and differential 
treatment are appropriately reserved for 
countries whose state of development and 
global competitiveness actually warrants 
such flexibility; 
(E) create new rules and structures that 
can serve the interests of the United States 
while promoting peace, prosperity, good gov-
ernance, transparency, effective operation of 
legal regimes, the rule of law, and free enter-
prise; and 
(F) expand upon the trilateral negotiations 
currently underway with Japan and the Eu-
ropean Union; and 
(6) the United States Trade Representative 
should explore and assess specific reform 
proposals, including— 
(A) pursuing plurilateral agreements that 
further the interests of the United States 
while limiting the benefits accruing to coun-
tries that are not parties to those agree-
ments; 
(B) efforts to ensure that incorrect inter-
pretations by the Appellate Body, including 
with respect to the Agreement on Safe-
guards, the Agreement on Implementation of 
Article VI of the General Agreement on Tar-
iffs and Trade 1994, and the Agreement on 
Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, are 
corrected, and not to be deemed preceden-
tial; 
(C) new rules and norms to address prac-
tices of nonmarket economies, such as prac-
tices relating to state-owned enterprises, 
which certain countries often utilize for ob-
jectives that cause severe trade distortions; 
and 
(D) better implementation of existing 
rules, such as the prohibition in paragraph 4 
of Article XIV of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade on currency manipulation, 
to ensure that those rules are effective to 
preserve the rights of free market econo-
mies.

Mr. CRAPO. Madam President and 
Members of the Senate, what we are 
going to be voting on shortly here, 
Senate Amendment No. 1562, is an ex-
ample of the bipartisanship that can be 
achieved if we put in the hard work to 
work out the details and the dif-
ferences between us on very critical 
issues. 
This is not just an amendment on 
one topic; this is an entire title, the Fi-
nance Committee’s title. The chairman 
of the Finance Committee, Senator 
WYDEN, and I have worked for months

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

together to identify that intersection— 
which is a big one, as you will see—be-
tween Republicans and Democrats here 
in the Senate on trade policy to help us 
to put together a package of strong 
trade policy that will help us to stand 
up our efforts in pushing back against 
China in one of the most critical are-
nas that we face: trade, our economy, 
and working against the very nefarious 
activities that China is engaged in to 
try to undercut us economically and to 
undercut our American companies in 
our trade relationships. 
Senator WYDEN and I worked hard to-
gether to get this done, and I am glad 
that we now have a package that can 
be put forward. As I said, it is not just 
one provision; this is an entire trade 
title. Let me summarize just some of 
the things that are in it. 
It provides a comprehensive approach 
to combat China’s manufacturing im-
balances, threats to free and fair trade, 
and illicit activity, which undermine 
America’s leadership in innovation. 
This legislation will level the playing 
field for American consumers and com-
panies, including workers, farmers, 
fishers, families, and taking aim at 
China’s worst practices. 
The amendment itself carries a bi-
partisan approach into a Senate-wide 
effort to ensure that the United States 
is positioned effectively to compete on 
a fair playing field globally—not just 
with China, globally, but especially 
with China. 
It bolsters efforts to prohibit goods 
made with forced labor from reaching 
the United States by strengthening our 
Customs and Border Protection en-
forcement efforts and through better 
use of the Seafood Import Monitoring 
Program. 
It provides modernized trade enforce-
ment tools to U.S. Trade Representa-
tives to address anti-competitive dig-
ital trade and censorship practices, 
like China’s great firewall, by requir-
ing the USTR to identify trading part-
ners that disrupt digital trade. 
It appoints a USTR official to over-
see information communication tech-
nology and provides advance notice and 
text of proposals for any digital trade 
agreements 5 days before they are ta-
bled to facilitate our efforts here in 
Congress to oversee an effective trade 
policy. 
It requires a review of trade in essen-
tial supplies, including the sources of 
imports, and analysis of any vulnera-
bilities, as well as additional tools for 
businesses in the United States seeking 
reliable suppliers. 
It strengthens oversight over U.S. 
trade policy by providing an inspector 
general to the USTR and by ensuring 
the application of section 301 tariffs re-
lated to China are calibrated to provide 
the 
necessary 
leverage 
to 
support 
American competition while ensuring 
U.S. 
competitiveness 
in 
manufac-
turing. 
It reauthorizes, critically, the mis-
cellaneous tariff bill—what has been 
called the MTB—and improved general-
ized system of preferences, the GSP. 
That will promote human rights, the 
environment, women’s economic em-
powerment, and the rule of law and 
digital trade, and restarts and reforms 
the critical section 301 product exclu-
sion process. These things might sound 
complicated, but it is our way of stand-
ing up our American competitors in a 
very 
anti-competitive 
environment 
dealing with China. 
It expands the duties of the Inter-
agency Center on Trade Implementa-
tion, Monitoring, and Enforcement to 
include investigations of practices, dif-
fuse impacts on the economy and work-
ers of the United States where there is 
systemic impacts on the resiliency of 
multiple 
critical 
domestic 
supply 
chains. Standing up and building out 
our supply chains is critical in this 
economic competition. 
It requires the U.S. Trade Represent-
atives to initiate talks with the Quad 
countries to develop a strategy on crit-
ical minerals to counter China’s domi-
nant share of that global supply. 
It requires the CBP to submit a re-
port to Congress on achieving supply 
chain transparency. CBP is seeking 
greater supply chain transparency to 
address merchandise made with forced 
labor, with counterfeits, and through a 
21st Century Customs Framework Ini-
tiative. 
It requires the USTR to brief Con-
gress on the findings of a forthcoming 
report by the Comptroller General of 
the United States related to that crit-
ical 301 exclusion process. 
It directs the USTR to enter into ne-
gotiations with allies to stop the im-
portation of goods made with stolen in-
tellectual property into the United 
States and allied countries. The theft 
of American intellectual property is 
becoming critical to our ability to be 
effectively competitive against China. 
This list goes on. This is a major Fi-
nance Committee title that will sig-
nificantly strengthen U.S. competitive-
ness in response to the malign activi-
ties that we continuously see growing 
from China. I encourage all of my col-
leagues to support this important 
amendment. 
Before I finish, I want to say what I 
was going to say at the beginning of 
my remarks, and I alluded to it briefly. 
Senator WYDEN and I have had a very 
close and strong negotiation going on, 
and I appreciate deeply the ability that 
we have to work together in a bipar-
tisan fashion to build this, and we will 
be building other very important poli-
cies for this country. I just wanted to 
thank my colleague Senator WYDEN for 
his partnership in this effort. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I, 
too, want to express my appreciation 
to Senator CRAPO. We are partners in 
the Senate Finance Committee. As 
Senator CRAPO really touched on, we 
know that sometimes around here in 
the Senate, it is hard to get Senators 
to agree on the proper way to butter a 
piece of toast. But what Senator CRAPO 
and I have tried to show—and I believe 
this amendment does it—is that the 
Senate is going to come together on 
the urgency of outcompeting China, 
and that is what our legislation is all 
about. 
Senator CRAPO ticked off a number of 
the key measures. Obviously we feel 
very strongly. We spent weeks looking 
at it in hearings and in discussions—at 
how China rips off our intellectual 
properties, steals technology, sends 
dangerous counterfeits to our market, 
and how it undercuts manufacturers 
with overproduction and unfair sub-
sidies. The fact is, the Chinese have de-
ployed massive subsidies, incentivized 
overproduction in key manufacturing 
sectors like steel, aluminum, and solar 
panels, that undercuts our competi-
tors. They have shaken down American 
firms for intellectual property and sto-
len cutting-edge technology. 
Worst of all, colleagues, is the prac-
tice of forced labor, which we looked at 
in the Senate Finance Committee. It is 
morally repugnant on its own, and it is 
also a very substantial threat to Amer-
ican jobs. 
I do want to spend a moment on an 
area where we are going to be doing a 
lot more work, and I am going to have 
plenty to say about it before this bill 
becomes law; and that is, as my friend 
from Idaho just talked about, the Chi-
nese Government’s great firewall. It 
blocks more than 10,000 American 
websites and digital platforms, and 
others are subjected to extreme censor-
ship. Americans who are blocked can 
only watch as Chinese homegrown 
competitors then rip off their very best 
ideas, thrive in the absence of real 
competition, and then grow into tech 
behemoths themselves. 
The catch is, as those Chinese-grown 
tech giants get bigger and bigger, using 
ripped-off American tech and ideas, 
they are also exporting their govern-
ment’s intolerance of free speech. 
So in the case of the great firewall, 
we now have trade enforcement tools 
that really go back to the Dark Ages. 
Literally, some of them date back to 
some cases in the middle of the last 
century, and that, in no way, leaves us 
in a good position. 
As Senator CRAPO and I have found— 
and we agreed in a bipartisan manner 
on this—it leaves us ill-prepared to 
handle the fast-moving world of digital 
trade, where there are a lot of high- 
skill, high-wage jobs on the line. 
So, for now, I hope Members of the 
Senate will strongly support this bipar-
tisan amendment. 
As Senator CRAPO said, we have a lot 
of other things we are going to tackle. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, I think 
what we talked about yesterday, in 
terms of clean energy, can build on 
ideas of both political parties. Senator 
CRAPO has a very good idea for tech- 
neutral, private sector competition for 
clean energy. That is his idea. I am a 
Democrat, and I am acknowledging my 
colleague’s good ideas. So we have a lot 
to work with.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3838 
May 27, 2021 
But for today, when we pass this 
amendment, the Crapo-Wyden amend-
ment, we are signaling that the entire 
Senate 
is 
coming 
together 
on 
a 
straightforward proposition, that we 
want to tell our constituents that we 
understand 
the 
urgency 
of 
outcompeting China, and that it is 
going to take key tools, which is what 
we have developed in the Senate Fi-
nance Committee. 
I urge all Senators to vote for this bi-
partisan amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1802 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I want 
to take a moment to speak on my 
amendment, and I won’t take very 
long. 
First of all, really, my comments are 
geared toward somebody who might be 
watching or will maybe watch a video 
of this later because usually there 
aren’t a lot of mysteries here on the 
floor of Senate. And when these amend-
ments come up, everybody kind of 
knows the way it is going to go. And 
this amendment that I am about to put 
forward here is probably not going to 
pass. I am pretty certain it won’t or we 
wouldn’t have gotten a vote on it. That 
is just the way it is. 
But that is OK because—it is not OK, 
but it is OK in the sense that I still 
want to take this opportunity to talk 
about this and have a vote on it. 
Let me just say this: If you go back 
2, 3 years, I believe not the first but 
one of the first people here who talked 
about the need to do what much of this 
bill does was me. I have been talking 
now for 2 or 3 years about the need for 
the American Government to step for-
ward and partner with the private sec-
tor. I have been talking about the need 
for industrial policy. 
You can’t compete with a nation- 
state if the nation-state is not involved 
in the competition. And that is what 
we are involved in—a nation-state com-
petition. And it does involve a massive 
amount of Chinese investment in re-
search and development. 
And we have to step up to the plate. 
The days of believing that on some of 
these items the private market on its 
own will solve it, it is not possible at 
this scale and scope. 
I point to Operation Warp Speed. 
Would the private market have eventu-
ally given us a vaccine? It would have. 
But we needed it now. We stepped for-
ward. We provided the money. The pri-
vate sector responded. And today we 
are standing around here with no 
masks on, and much of the country is 
getting back to normal because we 
have vaccines. 
You could criticize a lot of things 
about what America did in the begin-
ning of the pandemic, but we have done 
vaccines better than anyone in the 
world, and that would not have been 
possible 
without 
industrial 
policy, 
which is the partnership of government 
and business to solve an urgent crisis 
of a national concern. 
Well, when it comes to research, de-
velopment, technology, that is perhaps 
the single greatest requirement before 
us today in terms of the future. The 
21st century is going to be defined by 
this definition between China—this 
competition between China and the 
United States. And it is a competition 
we simply cannot win unless we step 
forward and match it. 
But another part of the Chinese ap-
proach to this is not simply to invest 
but to steal. As many of you know, I 
have been on the Intelligence Com-
mittee now for 10 years. I was acting 
chairman of it for a number of months 
and now the vice chairman in a com-
mittee that I think—maybe I am preju-
diced in this view, but I think it is the 
best functioning committee here. I am 
sure some would disagree. But I think 
we do a lot of good work. 
And it comes on topic—and I spend a 
lot of time reading all of the intel-
ligence every single day. Let me just 
describe my experiences over the last 
few years. It is a horror show. 
The Chinese are stealing our intellec-
tual property. And it is not just, oh, 
they reverse engineered someone’s soft-
ware; they steal the money the tax-
payers are investing in basic research 
and development. 
We have a graph here. I have it up. 
The print is too small to see on cam-
era, but I will describe it to you. Here 
is how they operate, use our univer-
sities. They prioritize—they steal pri-
ority 
technologies, 
leverage 
inter-
national openness of U.S. markets, uni-
versities, and institutes. They play sci-
entists, researchers in universities, 
U.S. National Labs, for access to 
emerging and foundational research 
and access to dual-use export control 
technologies. 
It goes on to say, Chinese state- 
owned enterprises’ front and shell com-
panies partner with universities for ac-
cess to IP, research data, technology, 
penetrate U.S. company supply chains. 
This is their strategy. 
Now, we were about to put $200 bil-
lion of American taxpayer money in 
more of that, in more of those activi-
ties. And you don’t think that they are 
going to do all of that against us? They 
are. And so it is incumbent upon us to 
make sure that we have in place safe-
guards so they cannot keep doing this 
to us. 
What is the point of putting up $200 
billion of American public taxpayer 
money on pursuing all of this research 
if we are going to allow the Chinese to 
steal it? Nobody here wants them to 
steal it. 
And I know there have been improve-
ments done in terms of upping the se-
curity. What I want you to understand 
is that this is not a minor security 
threat. This is the No. 1 priority of Chi-
nese intelligence. This is their No. 1 
priority. This is what all of their agen-
cies and all of their government is 
geared toward doing. And we are going 
to put all this money in there and hope 
that the safeguards we put in place are 
going to work. 
I hope they do. But what if they 
don’t? What if a year from now we find 
out, or you are going to read in an arti-
cle 2 years from now, whatever, that 
says: The Chinese have stolen a quar-
ter—25, 30 percent of the IP developed 
by the money that has been put for-
ward in the bill that was passed? Then 
we are all going to feel pretty stupid 
around here. 
That is the only thing I am aiming 
at. All I am asking in this amendment 
is that, at least in the initial stages of 
this program, that the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, the DNI, the DNI’s 
office, and the FBI have an opportunity 
to review these grants to ensure that 
they do not have embedded, in the 
place we are giving the money to, a sci-
entist, a researcher at one of these Na-
tional Labs or that there isn’t some 
shell company involved. 
Now, I know the argument. I have 
heard the argument against it from 
those who want to do the research. 
This is going to slow it down. It is. 
TSA slows down our ability to get on 
airplanes. Who wants to get rid of 
TSA? Cyber security slows down our 
ability to access our networks. But we 
need more of it, not less. Yes, security 
becomes burdensome. It slows things 
down. But I would rather do it slow or 
slower and own it than faster and have 
them steal it. And that is what this 
amendment does. 
I don’t know what the opposition to 
it is other than I understand that there 
are a lot who just want to get their 
hands on this money, and they want to 
get going very quickly. That is what 
they want to do, and that is great. 
That is what researchers want to do. 
They want to move fast. We need them 
to move fast. But our job is different. 
Our job is to see the problem holis-
tically and understand, let’s move as 
fast as we can without allowing the 
Chinese to steal it. 
So, look, I am asking everyone to 
vote against this motion to table be-
cause, frankly, I think we expose our-
selves to a vulnerability. We are plac-
ing the faith that this existing system 
we have, and whatever new one we are 
starting up, is going to be able to with-
stand the force of the intelligence 
agencies of an entire nation-state and 
their No. 1 objective, and that is how 
can we get our hands on whatever these 
$200 billion are helping to innovate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, 
speaking against this amendment, I 
know the Senator from Florida prob-
ably, 
given 
his 
intelligence 
work, 
wants to be well-meaning, but this 
amendment is not ready for the focus 
that we need to give on issues of coun-
terintelligence. 
This amendment, as drafted, literally 
says that the Director of National In-
telligence should look at and certify 
whether any of the entities given this 
money—including NASA, which would 
be given money under this bill—that 
they would have to certify for a 10-year 
period of time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3839 
May 27, 2021 
So, literally, every institution, every 
organization that gets money under 
this bill would have to certify for a 10- 
year period of time that they didn’t 
have anything to do with a Chinese in-
vestment. 
I am all for investigating theft and 
intellectual property. In fact, the Sen-
ator from Mississippi and I added sev-
eral 
provisions 
to 
our 
legislation. 
Other people have added things to this 
legislation. But do I want the Director 
of National Intelligence calling every 
university in the United States that 
might get money from this program 
and asking them to verify for the last 
10 years what did they ever take as far 
as Chinese investment? 
I have news for you. I want the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence to be fo-
cusing on cyber security. If somebody 
didn’t see, we have just had a major 
pipeline incident. It is not the first in-
cident; it is many incidents in which 
foreign governments have threatened 
our Nation, our sources of power, basi-
cally, by infiltrating our system. 
I want the Director of National Intel-
ligence to focus on Iran, to focus on 
Russia, to focus on North Korea, to 
focus on Syria, to focus on threats of 
terrorism. I want them to focus on 
monitoring our organizations nation-
wide. I do not want them spending 
their time calling university presidents 
and NASA officials asking them what 
they have done for the last 10 years and 
to verify before they can get the need-
ed research dollars. 
Now, I know the Senator is trying to 
be well-meaning, and I am happy to 
work with him on this issue. But I 
know this: The race is on in semi-
conductors. The race is on in quantum 
computing. The race is on in AI. The 
race is on in other areas of manufac-
turing. And we cannot afford to have 
our Director of National Intelligence 
spending his time calling up these peo-
ple when we have already implemented 
the securities in this legislation. 
I am happy to keep working with 
anybody on this issue. But, by God, I 
am telling you, we are going to be com-
mitted to doing more on our inter-
national threats on cyber security be-
cause, as you can see from this recent 
pipeline incident, that is where we 
should be spending our time and our 
focus, from a security perspective. 
I ask my colleagues to table the 
Rubio amendment.

ular order. And I ask to table the

ANTI-SEMITISM 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have 
the opportunity to chair the U.S. Hel-
sinki Commission. 
I am taking this time—I understand 
there is a break in the action in re-
gards to the underlying bill. If I am 
wrong on that, I will yield the floor to 
someone in regards to moving us for-
ward, but I understand that we are not 
ready for the next issue yet. 
So with that in mind, let me just 
take this time as the Chair of the U.S. 
Helsinki Commission representing the 
U.S. Senate. In the Helsinki Commis-
sion, my Republican counterpart is 
Senator WICKER. Senator WICKER, by 
the way, is the vice president of the Or-
ganization for Security and Coopera-
tion in Europe’s Parliamentary Assem-
bly, and I am the Special Representa-
tive on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and In-
tolerance. 
The Helsinki Final Act speaks very 
clearly against all forms of intolerance 
and discrimination. And we have seen 
in recent months current events trig-
ger latent bias in our community. 
We go back to 9/11, where we saw the 
uprise of hate against the Muslim com-
munity, which was translated into vio-
lence against Muslim Americans. 
We saw during COVID–19 latent bias 
against the Asian-American commu-
nity. As a result, we saw a rise of hate, 
of anti-Asian activity, bias, and vio-
lence, and this body took action. 
And, once again, as a result of recent 
violence in the Middle East, we see a 
rise of anti-Semitism here in the 
United States and around the world. 
I mention all of that because we need 
to speak out whenever we see the rise 
of intolerance in our community. So 
let me just talk about anti-Semitism 
and what has happened recently.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3840 
May 27, 2021 
A 
29-year-old 
Jewish 
man 
was 
punched, kicked, and pepper-sprayed 
last week in New York in broad day-
light, as a group of men yelled anti-Se-
mitic statements. People in cars began 
throwing bottles and yelling anti-Se-
mitic slurs, including words like ‘‘dirty 
Jew,’’ at a dinner party in Los Angeles. 
In Skokie, IL, someone shattered a 
window at a synagogue. In Bal Har-
bour, FL, men yelled, ‘‘Die Jew,’’ at a 
man in a skull cap, and then threat-
ened to rape his wife and daughter. 
These instances are compounded by 
an uptick in anti-Semitic speech on-
line, with the Anti-Defamation League 
finding 17,000 tweets between May 7 
and May 14—1 week—with some vari-
ation of the phrase: ‘‘Hitler was right.’’ 
These attacks follow the January 6 
Capitol insurrection earlier this year, 
where White Supremacist and extrem-
ist groups displayed anti-Semitic and 
racist symbols and recited conspiracy 
theories blaming Jews for the pan-
demic. These conspiracy theories have 
proliferated 
alongside 
anti-Semitic 
stereotypes 
and 
images 
being 
mainstreamed by some political lead-
ers and public figures. 
While these events are shocking, per-
haps we should not be surprised. The 
ADL Global Index on Anti-Semitism, 
updated in 2019, found that more than 1 
billion people—nearly 1 in 8—around 
the world harbor anti-Semitic atti-
tudes. 
Over 30 percent of those surveyed 
said it was ‘‘probably true’’ that Jews 
have too much control over financial 
markets; that Jews think they are bet-
ter than other people; that Jews are 
disloyal to their country; and that peo-
ple hate Jews because of the way Jews 
behave. A full 41 percent think Jews 
are more loyal to Israel than the coun-
try they live in. 
Such sentiments too often translate 
into violence, leaving 40 percent of Eu-
ropean Jews to report in 2018 that they 
live in daily fear of being physically at-
tacked. Here at home, Jews make up 
fewer than 3 percent of the American 
population, but the majority of re-
ported religious-based hate crimes tar-
geted Jewish people and institutions. 
I strongly agree with ADL’s CEO 
Jonathan Greenblatt, who said last 
week: 
[W]e are witnessing a dangerous and dras-
tic surge in anti-Jewish hate. . . . To those 
who choose to indulge in age-old antisemitic 
tropes, 
exaggerated 
claims 
and 
inflam-
matory rhetoric, it has consequences: at-
tacks in real life on real people targeted for 
no other reason than they are Jewish. This is 
antisemitism, plain and simple. And it’s in-
disputably inexcusable in any context. 
In 2004, I had the opportunity to rep-
resent America at the Berlin Con-
ference on Anti-Semitism, where we 
developed an action plan to stand up 
against anti-Semitism. The very first 
recommendation coming out of the 
Berlin conference is that leaders must 
speak out against anti-Semitism in 
any form; that leaders need to be 
heard. They cannot be silent. So I was 
very pleased when our President, Joe 
Biden, stated this past week: 
The recent attacks on the Jewish commu-
nity are despicable, and they must stop. I 
condemn this hateful behavior at home and 
abroad—it’s up to all of us to give hate no 
safe harbor. 
Thank you, President Biden. 
I was proud of our colleague Senator 
MAZIE HIRONO, a leader in the Asian- 
American community, who posted on 
social media: 
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again—an 
attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. 
We all must condemn the recent surge of 
antisemitic attacks in our country. Each of 
us needs to stand up, speak out, and confront 
this hatred. 
At my last in-person OSCE meeting 
before COVID–19, I hosted an event 
with my European colleagues entitled 
‘‘Lessons From the Past, Leadership 
for the Future,’’ where we spoke about 
the lessons from the Holocaust, includ-
ing early warning signs from the past— 
some of which have been rising to the 
surface again. These early warning 
signs include the rise of populist lead-
ers, demonizing of minorities, propa-
gandizing of hate, and the neglect of 
refugee protections, which ultimately 
became the factors that resulted in 
genocide. 
This month, I chaired a Helsinki 
Commission 
hearing 
on 
preventing 
mass atrocities with Professor Tim-
othy Snyder and the U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum’s Center for the 
Prevention 
of 
Genocide 
director, 
Naomi Kikoler. This Center’s Early 
Warning Project provides an innova-
tive risk assessment tool using quan-
titative and qualitative methods to 
spotlight countries where mass atroc-
ities have not begun, but where the 
risk of such violence is high. 
The warning signs are there. My col-
leagues, we are painfully reminded of 
our past. The OSCE has repeatedly re-
affirmed that hate crimes pose a threat 
to the security of individuals and soci-
ety, given their potential to lead to 
conflict and violence on a wider scale. 
The spread of hateful ideology and re-
cent acts of hate crimes and extremism 
across the OSCE region attest to this. 
In response, I have called for a plan 
of action to address violence and dis-
crimination across the OSCE region, 
including here in the United States, so 
that we may have a more strategic and 
cross-border approach to addressing 
hate. I have also supported the OSCE 
initiatives that address security con-
cerns of Jewish communities, including 
by improving relationships between 
law enforcement and justice institu-
tions and vulnerable communities, edu-
cating communities on anti-Semitism 
and how to counter it, and building al-
liances with other communities to 
counter hate. 
Over the past decade, I have also 
worked to ensure that the State De-
partment’s budget annually includes 
funding to fight anti-Semitism glob-
ally by creating civil society partner-
ships between the United States and 
Europe to work as allies to fight 
against anti-Semitism, racism, xeno-
phobia, anti-Muslim bigotry, hostility 
to the LGBTQ-plus community, and 
other forms of hate. The United States 
should be a global leader in fighting 
such intolerance. 
It would be hypocritical for us as a 
nation to preach to the world against 
hate if we let it fester and grow here at 
home. Like a virus, as we all know too 
well, if hate exists in one country, it 
has the capacity to spread around the 
world. 
Therefore, I ask all my Senate col-
leagues to join me in supporting these 
efforts at home and abroad to achieve 
safe and just societies for all. Hate 
takes many forms, but none of them 
should be acceptable here in the United 
States of America or anywhere else in 
the world. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 1260 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I am very 
proud of where the Senate is headed 
today. It has taken well over a year- 
and-a-half for this bill to finally come 
together, to come to fruition. There 
have been many committees of juris-
diction that actively participated in 
this process, Members who have accom-
modated other Members, and I am 
proud of the work product that we have 
been developing here. 
I especially want to thank, as we 
head toward what I hope is final pas-
sage later on this evening, my legisla-
tive director, Lauren O’Brien; my na-
tional security adviser, Brandt Ander-
son; Dan Cheever, who worked on Com-
merce Committee, all manner of work 
for me. They have worked tirelessly 
with Senator SCHUMER’s staff and my 
colleagues on the Republican side to 
ensure that this day came about, and 
we got a positive outcome. 
Let me say a bit about this legisla-
tion. We Americans have always looked 
toward the frontier and forward to new 
horizons. Our ancestors chased them 
across a continent and to the sea. 
When the wilderness was no more, they 
followed them elsewhere—in workshops 
and laboratories and factories and on 
farms, in the air and beyond. 
Our spirit is restless. We prefer the 
difficult as Americans. We have never 
accepted limits or impossibilities in 
life. No, instead, we sought to cure dis-
ease to lift the human condition, to 
better understand the world around us, 
to constantly go faster and further in 
these and other endeavors. And we do 
these things always aware that the new 
knowledge that they bring will benefit 
mankind and make our Union stronger. 
But this spirit is not entirely ours 
alone. You see, there are others out 
there who also harbor bold ambitions, 
but they don’t share our democratic

values. Just days ago, Communist 
China orbited, landed, and deployed a 
rover on the surface of Mars. No other 
nation has done this. No other nation 
has done this. It was their first voyage 
to the red planet. It is only part of the 
Chinese Communist Party’s ambitious 
space program. And it is another direct 
challenge to the United States of 
America. 
Now, this momentous event happens 
at a time when so many of our citizens 
feel overlooked, when the communities 
they call home are hollowing out, when 
trust in our civic institutions is erod-
ing, and when our allegiance seems in-
creasingly to our political tribes and 
not to one another as citizens for the 
common good. 
Let’s not kid ourselves. The Chinese 
Communist Party plans to exploit our 
difficulties and divisions. Their power 
and their capabilities are growing. 
They are, indeed, locked in a global 
competition with this great Nation, 
and they intend to win it. They intend 
to win it. 
They think of those of us in this 
Chamber as powerless to stop them and 
unable to prioritize our Nation’s long- 
term goals over our party’s short-term 
gains. 
So I ask you this: When future gen-
erations of Americans cast their gaze 
toward new frontiers, will they see a 
red flag planted on those new frontiers 
that is not our own? 
Today, we answer, unequivocally, no. 
Today, we declare our intention to win 
this century and those that follow it as 
well. Today, we demonstrate our faith 
in the American people to lead the way 
and vote to give them the tools to do 
so. 
This bill, this moment, is really not 
about beating China. It is really not 
about beating China. You see, the End-
less Frontier Act is about using their 
challenge to become a better version of 
ourselves. It is about helping more 
Americans get more skin in the game, 
deploying their talents and untapped 
potential. It is about supercharging our 
economy as we emerge from this global 
pandemic which descended upon us 
from Communist China. It is about 
spreading the benefits of this economy 
far and wide and preparing and allow-
ing more people, regardless of their cir-
cumstances or their place of birth, to 
meaningfully participate in the 21st 
century. 
It is about unleashing what Emma 
Lazarus called the imprisoned light-
ning across this land and aiding so 
many Americans in their pursuit of our 
common happiness. 
You see this is how we unite our Na-
tion and tilt the balance of a great 
power struggle westward. This is how 
we become the first to reach the next 
great horizon. 
Let history record that at this mo-
ment we stood united. We declared 
with solemn purpose and single voice 
that this is our destination; that by 
confronting the challenges of today, we 
built a brighter tomorrow; and that a 
new generation of doers and dreamers 
pressed America on, once again, toward 
the endless frontier. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut is recognized. 
JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I was tremen-
dously proud and grateful to be at the 
bill signing last week in the East Room 
of the White House with the President 
of the United States, at his side when 
he put his approval on a measure that 
took years to pass, the NO HATE Act— 
known as the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE 
Act, named after Khalid Jabara and 
Heather Heyer, who perished as a re-
sult of the most vicious and vile hate 
crimes in this Nation’s history. The oc-
casion was centered on legislation ad-
dressing protection for Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders. It was a tre-
mendously moving and powerful event 
when the President spoke passionately 
and unequivocally that hate has no 
safe harbor in the United States. 
I was reminded of those moments 
with the President of the United States 
as I witnessed just very recently this 
surge in anti-Semitic hate crimes 
across this country. We have seen them 
again and again and again. The Anti- 
Defamation League has been tracking 
anti-Semitic incidents in the country 
since 1979, and the past three annual 
reports have included two of its highest 
tallies. Last year’s report recorded 
more than 1,200 incidents—a 10-percent 
increase from the previous year. 
These assaults and insults, brawls, 
and vicious desecrations have occurred 
across the country to individuals in 
synagogues and places of worship, and 
we should be rising to condemn them 
now unequivocally and clearly, con-
demn all of these acts of hate, because 
we are all in this perilous time to-
gether. 
We know from the acts of hatred di-
rected against Asian Americans that 
they follow similar kinds of assaults 
and incidents involving Muslim Ameri-
cans, Black Americans, and Jewish 
Americans. An assault on one is an as-
sault on all of us. But the assaults and 
the acts of hatred against Jewish 
Americans have been particularly vile 
and venomous over these last 2, 4 
weeks and months. We have seen not 
only the physical attacks but also Hol-
ocaust denial and distortion, including 
intentional efforts to excuse or mini-
mize the impact of the Holocaust. 
These kinds of vicious and intoler-
able statements have grown. That is 
one reason why I continue to support 
the Never Again Education Act, which 
was signed into law almost 1 year ago, 
to expand the United States Holocaust 
Museum education programming and 
the development and dissemination of 
accurate, relevant, and accessible re-
sources to improve awareness and un-
derstanding of the Holocaust. But pre-
vention 
through 
education 
is 
not 
enough. We must do more. We must 
act. 
What is most important to remember 
about every one of these incidents is 
that they involve real people, real com-
munities, and real victims whose lives 
are torn apart in the most heart-
breaking cases. They involve real lives 
that are lost forever and real families 
who will never see their loved ones 
again. 
That is what happened to the fami-
lies of Khalid Jabara and Heather 
Heyer. They were in the East Room of 
the White House with us, graciously 
and generously lending their presence, 
their faces, and their voices to this ef-
fort against hate crime. They expressed 
gratitude for the actions we are taking. 
Now we must move forward to pro-
vide the funding for the NO HATE Act 
so we have greater reporting of these 
vicious acts and so that we have better 
training and more prevention and ac-
tion—not just condemnation but action 
against anti-Semitism in this country. 
I read recently that a 5-year-old was 
constructing a Lego of a synagogue 
and, using those Legos, added a secu-
rity force around the synagogue. What 
kind of America is it that requires a 5- 
year-old building a place of worship out 
of Legos to include a police security 
guard? And what kind of America is it 
that has double the number of reported 
anti-Semitic harassment, vandalism, 
and violence just over a 2-week period 
most recently when there were clashes 
in Israel and Gaza? It is not the Amer-
ica we know and love, and it is not the 
America we deserve. 
We must do better, and I know my 
colleagues share this view. I heard and 
saw my friend and colleague Senator 
CARDIN speak powerfully on this issue 
just moments ago. We know that we as 
a body can take action because hate is 
contagious, but so is courage. We must 
provide all of the people who have 
courage and good will in this country 
with the kind of support that we can, 
that we must, and that we will to fight 
anti-Semitism and to make sure that 
this America is the one that we know 
and love and that my father came to 
believe in as an immigrant at the age 
of 17 when he escaped persecution in 
Germany, coming here at 17 years old 
in 1935 with not much more than the 
shirt on his back, knowing no one, 
speaking virtually no English, but be-
lieving in that America that would pro-
vide him freedom and opportunity and, 
yes, protection against exactly the 
kind of anti-Semitism whose begin-
nings are in those kinds of vile and vi-
cious assaults and words we see around 
the world today. 
Let us all come together and fight 
anti-Semitism just as we have done 
with the hate crimes against our broth-
er and sister Asian Americans and 
make sure that our country is the one 
that we know and love. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520

S3842 
May 27, 2021 
Improvement and Increasing Preven-
tion Act. 
This bill would ensure that when 
crimes are committed in our military, 
justice is delivered. This commonsense 
reform, which has bipartisan, fili-
buster-proof support, moves the deci-
sion on whether to prosecute serious 
crimes to independent, trained, and 
professional 
military 
prosecutors, 
while 
leaving 
misdemeanors 
and 
uniquely military crimes within the 
chain of command. In other words, it 
takes the same approach to criminal 
justice that the military takes in most 
other areas of operation. It puts highly 
technical work in the hands of trained 
specialists. 
This is not a new concept. I first in-
troduced a similar form of this legisla-
tion in 2013. 
This is not a new idea that requires 
hypothetical thinking. This system or 
a version of it is already being used by 
our allies around the world to positive 
effect. Australia has moved charging 
decisions for serious crimes from the 
chain of command to the director of 
military prosecutions, as has Canada, 
New Zealand, and Ireland. In France, 
charging decisions are made by law-
yers, not by commanders. Germany 
tries military cases in civilian courts 
with civilian authorities. In Italy, 
charging decisions are made by judge 
advocates, who are fully independent of 
the chain of command. The Nether-
lands assigns charging decisions to 
public prosecutors with broad experi-
ence in military cases. Norway uses 
military 
prosecuting 
authority 
for 
criminal offenses by military per-
sonnel. The UK moved serious crimes 
out of the chain of command in 2009 as 
part of an effort to provide an inde-
pendent and impartial tribunal to the 
accused. In Israel, charging decisions 
are made by judge advocates whose 
sole commander is the military advo-
cate general, a general officer. 
I will note that the Israeli system is 
almost identical to the procedures set 
forth in our bill. Israel has not seen a 
decrease in good order and discipline 
and, in fact, has seen increased report-
ing and faith in their military justice 
system. 
These countries took serious crimes 
out of the chain of command because 
they believed that defendants have a 
right to civil liberties. They recognized 
that servicemembers deserve a trial 
not led by a commander, who often has 
no legal experience or education, but 
by trained criminal lawyers. 
When they made these changes, they 
did not see a diminution in command 
control or the ability to maintain good 
order and discipline within their ranks. 
In fact, when we stop asking com-
manders to act as judge and jury in 
complex cases, they will have more 
time to focus on rebuilding the trust 
and cohesion among their ranks that 
we know is critical to military readi-
ness. 
We pride ourselves on having the best 
military in the world. To maintain it, 
we need to do more to make it safe for 
everyone to serve. Our allies have al-
ready done this. Every day we don’t act 
is a day we fall further behind on this 
front. 
This is a tried and tested system. It 
has delivered change for our allies that 
the incremental reforms put in place 
by the Armed Services Committee have 
not delivered to our servicemembers. 
This reform has been tested; requested 
by 
survivors, 
veterans, 
and 
com-
manders; backed by experts in military 
justice; and supported by 65 Senators. 
There is no reason to delay a vote on 
the floor any further. 
I ask unanimous consent that, at a 
time to be determined by the majority 
leader in consultation with the Repub-
lican leader, the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours for debate equally 
divided in the usual form; and that 
upon the use or yielding back of that 
time, the Senate vote on the bill with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object. For the reasons I 
articulated on Monday and remain, I 
think, accurate, I would object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
would like to actually give some infor-
mation to the chairman about what 
these other nations’ leaders have actu-
ally said about this issue. 
Major General Blaise Cathcart, advo-
cate general of the Canadian Armed 
Forces, wrote: 
The 1999 changes to the military justice 
system were battle tested in the theater of 
active operations and, in my view, were a 
key contributor to combat effectiveness of 
the Canadian armed forces. The current mili-
tary justice system contributed substan-
tially to the fielding and sustainment of a 
disciplined and efficient force with high mo-
rale. 
Air Commander Paul Cronan, direc-
tor general of the Australian Defense 
Force Legal Service: 
At this point, it’s appropriate to reflect on 
the effect of the reforms made to the Aus-
tralian military justice system in 2003 and 
2006. These reforms have undoubtedly had a 
significant and positive impact on the effi-
cacy, impartiality, and perceived fairness of 
Australia’s military justice system. This is a 
fact confirmed by a number of subsequent 
independent reviews of the effectiveness of 
the 2003 and 2006 reforms. As a result of their 
independent review, they concluded that the 
reforms had been effective, and that as a re-
sult of these reforms, ‘‘The military justice 
system is delivering and should continue to 
deliver impartial, rigorous, and fair out-
comes. Enhanced transparency and enhanced 
oversight is substantially more independent 
from the chain of command, and is effective 
in maintaining a high standard of discipline 
both domestically and in the operational 
theater.’’ 
In 
the 
UK, 
Commander 
Andrei 
Spence, Commodore Naval Legal Serv-
ice, Royal Navy, UK: 
Probably the most pressing question that 
you need answering from me, and if I may 
preempt it slightly at the risk of being too 
forthcoming, is what’s the effect on com-
mand of our changes? How do they view it? 
Do they feel disempowered, disenfranchised? 
I have to say that the simple answer to that 
is no. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to enter this testimony into the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
MJIIPA: ALLIES TESTIMONY 
MAJ. GEN. BLAISE CATHCART, ADVOCATE 
GENERAL OF THE CANADIAN ARMED FORCES 
‘‘The Canadian armed forces require a ro-
bust and fair military justice system to in-
vestigate, prosecute, and adjudicate allega-
tions of sexual assault. As the super-
intendent of the administration of the Cana-
dian military justice system, I am confident 
our system meets the disciplinary needs of 
the chain of command while addressing the 
interests of victims and reflecting the con-
stitutionality protected Canadian values of 
fairness, transparency, and the rule of law 
. . . The 1999 changes to the military justice 
system were battle tested in the theater of 
active operations and, in my view were a key 
contributor to the combat effectiveness of 
the Canadian armed forces. The current mili-
tary justice system contributed substan-
tially to the fielding and sustainment of a 
disciplined and efficient force with high mo-
rale.’’ 
MAJ. GEN. STEVE NOONAN, DEPUTY COMMANDER, 
CANADIAN JOINT OPERATIONS COMMAND 
‘‘My intent is simply to inform the Panel 
that as an operational commander, I’m very 
comfortable with where we have evolved to, 
recognizing the continued key role of the 
commanding officer in the system, and the 
latitude that the system still provides for us 
to maintain good order and discipline, two 
key elements of operational effectiveness 
. . . In terms of the role of the commanding 
officer in the court martial process, in sen-
sitive matters, like an alleged sexual as-
sault, we believe it is in the best interest of 
the chain of command, the accused, and the 
complainant to have an independent investi-
gator assess the evidence and lay charges, an 
independent prosecutor determine whether 
or not to proceed, and an independent court 
martial administrator convene a court mar-
tial. All of these actors, in my view, 
strengthen my role in the chain of command 
as those under my command can be con-
fident in the real and perceived independence 
of the military justice system.’’ 
AIR COMM. PAUL CRONAN, DIRECTOR GENERAL, 
AUSTRALIAN DEFENSE FORCE LEGAL SERVICE 
‘‘At this point, it’s appropriate to reflect

Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2103 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to support amendment No. 2103, which 
addresses a very important issue in the 
world, which is the issue of govern-
ments that undertake to destroy popu-
lations, either in other countries or 
within their own country; that is, to 
commit genocide. 
Now, this topic comes up because 
China is committing genocide against 
its own Uighur population—a million 
Uighurs who are enslaved, who are 
trapped, who are assaulted in every 
possible way by the official authorities 
operating out of Beijing. 
The finding of genocide is one that 
the State Department takes very seri-
ously. It involves long investigations, 
collection of evidence, analysis. It is 
not something to say lightly. But we 
now have two Secretaries of State who 
have led our State Department through 
this process and reached the same con-
clusion—Secretary 
Pompeo, 
under 
President 
Trump, 
and 
Secretary 
Blinken, under President Biden. And 
both find that this is, in fact, genocide. 
Now, at this very moment, athletes 
are preparing to compete in the Olym-
pic Games in China, and I find it hor-
rific that the prestige of the Games is 
going to be carried on for a country 
that is committing genocide. 
Now, we have a Commission that 
works on human rights issues, known 
as the Congressional-Executive Com-
mission on China, and it hauls a whole 
team of experts who work to analyze 
human rights issues. This commission, 
which is bipartisan and bicameral and 
includes executive branch appointees, 
when they are actually appointed, has 
held a hearing. 
At that hearing, various experts 
came and testified on what China is 
doing. It reinforced what the Secretary 
of State under our former President 
and the Secretary of State under our 
current President found: Genocide is 
being conducted by the government in 
China against the Uighur population. 
And that is not all China is doing. 
There are other afflicted groups that it 
is assaulting. In addition, it has pro-
ceeded to start stripping the political 
rights of the people of Hong Kong. 
It is very much in the news. We have 
seen the citizens protesting in the 
streets, hundreds of thousands, saying: 
China, honor the commitment you 
made when Britain transferred Hong 
Kong back under a 50-year agreement 
to China. 
And China has not honored that 
agreement. 
Now, China, when it was awarded the 
Games back in 2015 to be held in 2022— 
7 years in advance—made human rights 
promises to the International Olympic 
Committee—promises that have not 
been upheld. In fact, during those 
years, China has become an even worse 
violator of human rights in Hong Kong, 
in Xinjiang, and in other ethnic areas, 
including Tibet. 
So we have echoes of 1936—the year 
the summer Olympics were held in Ger-
many and Hitler was in charge. He used 
those Olympic Games to shine prestige 
on his country and to essentially help 
distract enormously from his already 
horrific actions against Jewish Ger-
mans and other groups within Ger-
many. 
So how is it here, nearly a century 
later, that, again, the Olympics are 
going to be used to shine a little bit of 
light and a lot of prestige on a country 
engaged in genocide? 
I want to compliment my colleague 
Senator ROMNEY of Utah. He has placed 
in the underlying bill, as it came out of 
the Foreign Relations Committee, a 
provision that says: When the Olym-
pics are held, there should be a diplo-
matic boycott to protest and draw at-
tention to this egregious situation. I 
hope, also, that the sponsors of those 
games will start to withdraw their 
sponsorships. 
Now, my friend and colleague Sen-
ator ROMNEY is an expert on the Olym-
pic Games because he organized the 
Olympic Games in Utah. Nobody in 
America probably knows more about 
what it takes to prepare for them. And 
it is not, at this moment, possible for 
the structure that has been established 
to host the athletes to be redone and to 
pivot for just next year, which I find 
unfortunate, but I understand the 
point. 
So let’s do this together. Let’s send a 
strong message to the Olympic Com-
mittee, the IOC, that never again 
should they allow a country to host the 
Olympic Games that is engaged in 
genocide. This should be a message 
that every American can say to-
gether—that never should a country be 
given the prestige of hosting the games 
when they are committing genocide. 
Never should a country be able to host 
the games when it is something like 
what China is doing to the Uighur pop-
ulation—enslaving 
them, 
stripping 
them of their dignity, their autonomy, 
their culture, controlling them in 
every way, enslaving them. Never 
again should the Games be able to be 
hosted by a country like China that is 
restricting the political rights of Hong 
Kong—what China is doing, stripping 
the freedom of speech, stripping the 
freedom of assembly, and breaking the 
deal that it signed when the deal was 
struck with Britain for the return of 
Hong Kong. 
So this amendment, cosponsored by 
Senator RUBIO, who is the cochair in 
the Senate of the Congressional-Execu-
tive Commission on China; cosponsored 
by Senator ROMNEY, who knows more 
about the Olympic Games than any-
body else in this country; cosponsored 
by Senator YOUNG, who has been a ter-
rific champion against the abuse of 
citizens in Yemen and the abuse of citi-
zens in Burma—let’s adopt this amend-
ment as part of this package while we 
are on the topic of China, while we are 
on the topic of trade. 
Let’s not let this moment bypass us 
without saying with a unified voice 
that this is wrong, and that the Olym-
pics, which were designed to lift up the 
human spirit, to celebrate the best of 
competition, to have kind of the thrills 
and the agonies of victory and defeat— 
that never should the Games, the focal 
point of world attention, be hosted by 
a country that is committing genocide. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, col-
leagues, this coming Monday is Memo-
rial Day. Many of us are making our 
plans to commemorate the holiday, the 
weekend, where we honor those who 
made the ultimate sacrifice in defense 
of our Nation and in defense of our de-
mocracy—those brave Americans and 
so many others who have worked, 
fought, and died for more than 200 
years to protect our system of govern-
ment—of the people, by the people, for 
the people. Upholding that legacy is 
our highest duty, and it is in that spir-
it that I rise today. 
On November 3, 2020, I was serving as 
California’s secretary of state. It was 
my privilege for 6 years to serve as the 
chief elections officer in our Nation’s 
most populous and most diverse State, 
and I can tell you that even in the best 
of times, election administration is 
complex. Elections are consequential 
operations. 
Last year, our elections workers at 
all levels of government faced the addi-
tional, unprecedented challenge of ad-
ministering an election during a global 
health pandemic. And I am proud to 
say that they rose to the occasion to 
protect the democratic legacy that we 
hold and trust. And, as a result, Cali-
fornia’s election officials administered 
an accessible, secure, and safe election, 
which drew historic voter turnout. In-
deed, by every objective measure, the 
2020 elections were a national success. 
But none of this mattered to Presi-
dent Trump, who had spent years at-
tacking the integrity of our elections 
by repeatedly lying about voter fraud 
and ‘‘rigged elections,’’ even the elec-
tion that he won in 2016. 
President Trump was furious at his 
2020 loss, and he chose to take a sledge-
hammer to the core of our democratic 
system. He didn’t just refuse to con-
cede the election—breaking a tradition 
that dates back to Thomas Jefferson— 
President Trump attacked the very no-
tion of a peaceful transition of power.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3844 
May 27, 2021 
Along the way, he filed and lost more 
than 60 cynical lawsuits challenging 
the election. He personally called State 
elections officials and pressured them 
to alter vote tallies—tallies that had 
been counted, recounted, and audited. 
And he lied to the American people, 
tweeting out a steady stream of con-
spiracy theories and disinformation de-
nying his electoral loss. 
Online 
and 
around 
the 
country, 
President Trump’s Big Lie caught fire. 
Sadly, many Republican officials par-
ticipated in fanning the flames, spread-
ing fears of voter fraud for political 
gain. Others stood by silently as Presi-
dent Trump radicalized his supporters 
with falsehoods. They chose loyalty to 
Trump over the truth, delusion over 
democracy. 
Let me be clear. These allegations of 
fraud had no basis in fact. They were 
rooted in Trump’s ego and cemented in 
White supremacy. And they led di-
rectly to the deadly insurrection of 
January 6, an unprecedented attack on 
our Nation’s Capitol by violent extrem-
ists against the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and this Senate, invited 
and incited by the President of the 
United States. 
Armed rioters brutally beat Capitol 
Police officers and stormed this build-
ing. The Confederate flag, the symbol 
of violent White supremacy, flew inside 
this Capitol for the first time in our 
Nation’s history. Members of milita-
rized hate groups searched these hall-
ways with the intent to kill elected 
leaders of both parties. They made 
their way to this very floor to try to 
stop the certification of the Presi-
dential election, and in so doing, they 
terrorized our staff, Capitol Police, the 
free press, our citizens across the coun-
try, and our democracy itself. 
Through their violence, the January 
6 rioters disrupted our democracy at 
the behest of President Trump, and our 
Nation lost the right to call the transi-
tion of power peaceful. 
Now we gather in the wake of this 
armed insurrection, the deadly insur-
rection. The scars of January 6 can 
still be seen throughout the building. 
Yet many of my Republican colleagues 
say: We just need to move on. Let’s 
just move forward. 
They say that this deadly attack was 
simply a group of ‘‘peaceful protesters’’ 
on a ‘‘normal tourist visit’’? They 
claim that the proposed Commission to 
investigate the January 6 insurrection 
is unnecessary because we have already 
increased Capitol security and our con-
gressional committees are already in-
vestigating this attack. 
These arguments are outrageous. Of 
course we need an independent Com-
mission to fully investigate the causes 
of the attack. We need to know the 
whole truth about January 6. We need 
and the American people deserve an 
independent, bipartisan investigation 
that will give us the facts and allow us 
to begin the hard work of restoring 
public trust in our democracy. It is the 
only way to ensure that an attack like 
this does not happen again. 
The bipartisan bill we are consid-
ering is modeled after the bipartisan 9/ 
11 Commission. Imagine arguing in the 
wake of 9/11 that the only problem that 
we needed to address was airport secu-
rity. That is how ridiculous this 
counterargument is. To brush aside the 
January 6 attack on the American peo-
ple would be the ultimate dereliction 
of our duty. 
Colleagues, we swore an oath to sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic. So I call on my Re-
publican colleagues to live up to that 
oath, live up to that sacred duty. And 
if you cannot, if your hand is frozen by 
fear of those who were misled to be-
lieve that the election was stolen, if 
your hand is frozen out of fear of the 
President who sold that lie, then the 
insurrectionists have succeeded. 
I urge the Senate to authorize the 
January 6 Commission on a bipartisan 
vote, but if our Republican colleagues 
refuse to join us, then we will face an-
other choice: Do we continue to defend 
our system of self-government or de-
fend the filibuster? The stakes could 
not be higher. The choice could not be 
clearer. The peaceful transition of 
power must be defended. 
Colleagues, this is a moment where 
we must put country over politics, put 
the institutions of our democracy over 
the abuse of the filibuster. On January 
6, our government was attacked, and 
now the future of our democracy is on 
the line. Let’s act like it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 1260 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I want-
ed to come to the floor very briefly 
today to thank Chairman MENENDEZ 
and Ranking Member RISCH
for the 
great work they did on the Foreign Re-
lations Committee to add to the pend-
ing legislation a title developed in the 
Foreign 
Relations 
Committee 
that 
makes sure that we are building the 
kinds of capacities inside the State De-
partment and USAID that are able to 
make sure America can compete with 
China and a host of other developing, 
advancing 
nations 
all 
around 
the 
world. 
The fact is, we are often fighting our 
competitors with one hand tied behind 
our back. For instance, the size of the 
Chinese 
international 
development 
bank dwarfs the capacities of the simi-
lar institution that is used by the 
United States of America, the DFC. 
We have added new capacities to the 
DFC in this legislation that will allow 
the United States of America to be able 
to make sure that we can do develop-
ment deals around the world and com-
pete with other nations that are fast 
investing 
significant 
amounts 
of 
money and trying to use that money as 
leverage to gain political interest and 
political influence. 
Included 
in 
that 
title, 
midwifed 
through the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, is a provision that builds 
upon the expectation that Congress 
should have that the administration 
share with us agreements that they 
have entered into on behalf of the 
United States. If we want to play our 
constitutional role to be a coequal 
branch with the executive on the set-
ting of American foreign policy, then, 
of course, this body needs to have ac-
cess—immediate access—to any agree-
ments, whether they be binding or non-
binding, that the Federal Government, 
through the executive branch, has en-
tered into on behalf of the American 
people. 
I am very pleased that the legislation 
includes a requirement that, in an ex-
peditious 
manner, 
the 
executive 
branch, whether there is a Republican 
President or a Democratic President, 
share with Congress any agreements 
that they have entered into on behalf 
of our constituents. 
That section of the bill goes a little 
bit further than that, though. It also 
says that the administration shall no-
tify Congress anytime that the admin-
istration is beginning a negotiation 
over a prospective agreement with a 
foreign nation. Again, that, on its face, 
makes a lot of sense, the idea that the 
administration 
should 
be 
commu-
nicating with Congress when they have 
begun a significant negotiation with a 
foreign country that may ultimately 
obligate the United States or this Con-
gress with respect to an international 
agreement. 
I raised, during the consideration of 
this bill in the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee and I have continued to raise 
both publicly and privately, concerns I 
have that I think are shared by current 
and former diplomats that there is a 
potential that by going too far in our 
request that the administration inform 
us of negotiations, we could provide a 
chill on both our government’s willing-
ness to enter into what are sometimes 
very sensitive, early negotiations with 
foreign governments but also a chill on 
foreign nations’ interest in entering 
into negotiations with the United 
States of America if they were to un-
derstand that anytime they began a 
conversation with the United States 
about a very sensitive matter, there 
would be a notification to Congress 
that could easily become public. 
In fact, there are good reasons some-
times where the executive branch, 
early on in a negotiation, before they 
know whether it is even going to be-
come an agreement a year, 2 years 
down the line, would want the space to 
conduct that negotiation without the 
public eye coming down on those pro-
ceedings. 
So I think there is a way to get this 
right. I think that we want to make

sure that any agreements are sent to 
Congress. I can even understand how, 
in some circumstances, when you are 
talking about big negotiations of na-
tional significance, we would want to 
know at some point when those nego-
tiations have begun. But I think you 
have to understand that there are two 
equities at play here. One is trans-
parency, the right of Congress to get 
information from the executive branch, 
but the other equity is that we don’t 
want to do anything here that would 
disincentivize diplomacy, that would 
create a massive bureaucracy inside 
the State Department that would serve 
as a barrier to negotiations with coun-
tries that may avoid a war or may end 
up in a more efficient expenditure of 
U.S. taxpayer dollars. 
So I want to raise this concern about 
this language that is included in the 
substitute amendment. I know that 
there is a long way before this bill is 
law. Obviously, the House will take up 
their own version, and there will be 
some reconciliation between the House 
and the Senate. And I am glad to have 
Senator MENENDEZ’s commitment to 
continue to have this discussion to 
make sure that we balance these equi-
ties—the equity of Congress’s right to 
know with the equity to invest and 
incentivize in American diplomacy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota is recognized. 
TRIBUTE TO LYNN AAS 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, it is a 
great honor for me today to recognize 
a North Dakota legend who is cele-
brating his 100th birthday on June 4. 
Lynn Aas, of Minot, is one of our 
State’s most treasured residents. With 
his engaging personality and deep com-
mitment to public service, Lynn has 
experienced many great moments in 
our State’s and in our Nation’s history. 
Lynn was raised during the Great De-
pression on a farm near the town of 
Benedict, 40 miles south of Minot. He 
earned law and business degrees from 
the University of North Dakota, man-
aged a medical clinic, served in the 
North Dakota Legislature for 8 years, 
and was a delegate to the State’s 1972 
Constitutional Convention. He and his 
late wife Beverly raised four sons. To 
this day, Lynn remains active in his 
community. 
With all that has been so remarkable 
about Lynn’s life, it is his service dur-
ing World War II that resonates the 
most with those who know him. Like 
with so many other young North Dako-
tans, the Japanese attack on Pearl 
Harbor in December of 1941 changed the 
course of Lynn’s life. 
In August 1942, Lynn had just fin-
ished his first year of college when he 
enlisted in the U.S. Army. He began 
basic training in March 1943 and be-
came part of the 193rd Glider Infantry 
Regiment of the 17th Airborne Divi-
sion. 
Following 
intensive 
training 
stateside, he boarded a ship in Boston 
in August 1944 heading to Liverpool, 
England. 
Lynn’s first combat experience was 
the Battle of the Bulge, one of the cost-
liest battles in American history, with 
more than 80,000 U.S. casualties, in-
cluding 19,000 American soldiers killed. 
His division and unit were flown to 
France and transported by trucks to 
Bastogne on December 24, 1944. His pla-
toon entered combat on January 7, 
fighting in deep snow, frigid cold, and 
heavy fog. Beginning with 55 troopers, 
Lynn was one of only 5 survivors to 
leave the frontlines 3 weeks later. 
The end of January brought his first 
2 nights of sleep under a roof in 5 
weeks. 
In February, his platoon fought along 
the Siegfried Line on Nazi Germany’s 
border. 
Later in March, he participated in 
Operation Varsity, the last large-scale 
Allied airborne operation of the war. 
There, he was towed in a glider and 
landed behind enemy lines near Wesel, 
Germany. 
Lynn’s combat days ended on March 
25 when he was wounded in his left arm 
by shrapnel. Following extensive recu-
peration back in America, Lynn re-
mained in the Army another 5 months 
until he was honorably discharged on 
November 1, 1945. 
For his valor and commendable 18 
months of service during World War II, 
he was awarded the Purple Heart and 
Bronze Star medals, in addition to the 
Glider Badge, Combat Infantryman’s 
Badge, Good Conduct Medal, American 
Campaign Medal, European Campaign 
Medal with one Bronze Arrowhead and 
three Bronze Campaign Stars, and the 
World War II Victory Medal. 
Later in his life, Lynn attend re-
unions of the 17th Airborne Division. In 
1999, he visited Europe with other 17th 
Airborne Division veterans, visiting 
the locations where they had fought 
more than 55 years earlier. 
In 2015, he visited Belgium again to 
commemorate the 70th anniversary of 
the Battle of the Bulge. As one of the 
official 
representatives 
from 
the 
United States to this observance, Lynn 
was greeted by many grateful Belgians 
who had not forgotten what American 
soldiers did to liberate them from Hit-
ler’s tyranny. 
In 
2017, 
the 
French 
Government 
awarded Lynn its highest honor, the 
Knight of the Legion of Honor medal— 
an award created by Napoleon in 1802. 
It was my great honor to be at that 
commemoration. The letter from the 
French Government notifying Lynn of 
this award carried these poignant 
words: 
73 years ago, you gave your youth to 
France and the French people. Many of your 
fellow soldiers did not return but they re-
main in our hearts. . . . You saved us. We 
will never forget. For us, the French people, 
you are a hero. Gratitude and remembrance 
are forever in our souls. 
Mr. President, Lynn Aas was one of 
60,000 North Dakotans to serve in the 
U.S. Armed Forces during World War 
II. Of those, nearly 2,000 gave their 
lives for our freedom in this largest 
and deadliest conflict in world history. 
With only some 500 World War II vet-
erans still alive in North Dakota, the 
heroism of every single one of them is 
appreciated more than ever. 
Throughout his life, Lynn Aas has 
embodied the best of the ‘‘greatest gen-
eration.’’ He has lived a meaningful 
life, sharing his history as a World War 
II soldier throughout so the rest of us 
can better understand and appreciate 
the selfless service and sacrifice of 
every veteran. 
On behalf of all North Dakotans, I 
wish Lynn Aas a very happy 100th 
birthday on June 4 and many more 
years of health and vitality. As he cele-
brates with his large family and many 
friends in Minot, I honor him as one of 
North Dakota’s most exemplary citi-
zens. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas is recognized. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank our friend Senator 
CRAMER for telling us this story about 
this great American patriot. Many of 
us are of that age where we are the 
children of members of the ‘‘greatest 
generation’’ who have their own stories 
to tell. Just listening to Senator 
CRAMER talk about this great patriot 
who fought at the Battle of the Bulge, 
one of the most horrific battles in 
World War II and most consequential 
battles—that is really where they real-
ly stopped Hitler, finally, toward the 
end of the war—it reminds me of people 
like my dad who flew B–17s out of Eng-
land during the last part of the war. 
Their job was to knock out the Hitler 
war machine. But there are so many 
great stories from that generation. 
These great World War II patriots are 
getting older, and they are leaving us, 
but certainly we will always remember 
them and their contributions. So I ap-
preciate the Senator from North Da-
kota sharing that with us. 
S. 1260 
Mr. President, the Senate is moving 
quickly, I hope, toward a vote on a far- 
reaching proposal to confront threats 
from China. Based on everything we 
know about the might and the ambi-
tions of the Chinese Communist Party, 
there is a clear and urgent need for us 
to take action. 
Every year, the U.S. intelligence 
community issues a threat assessment 
report outlining the greatest chal-
lenges confronting our country on the 
horizon. Topping the latest report, 
which was released last month, is Chi-
na’s push for global power. The report 
outlines China’s efforts to strengthen 
its military power, diversify its nuclear 
arsenal, and fine-tune its cyber espio-
nage skills, which are already quite 
considerable. 
One major area that cannot be over-
looked is China’s industrial policy. 
Through the CCP’s Made in China 2025 
initiative, it seeks to achieve China’s 
dominance 
in 
high-tech 
manufac-
turing. For everything from electric 
cars to advanced robotics, to artificial

intelligence, to quantum computing, 
China wants to lead global production, 
and they are throwing serious money 
into the effort to get there. China is ex-
pected to spend $1.4 trillion by 2025, 
covering investments in everything 
from 5G to artificial intelligence. 
The 2021 threat assessment report 
raises alarm bells here too. It says 
China will maintain these efforts be-
cause ‘‘Chinese leaders see this strat-
egy as necessary to reduce dependence 
on foreign technologies, enable mili-
tary advances, and sustain economic 
growth and thus ensure the CCP’s sur-
vival.’’ I view this as both an alarming 
statement but really more as a call to 
action. If China is making these kinds 
of investments to increase its inde-
pendence 
and 
global 
presence, 
we 
should be investing in our industrial 
base and our national security here at 
home. The most important place to 
start, I believe, is with semiconductor 
manufacturing. 
The pandemic is hopefully soon to be 
in our rearview mirror as more and 
more Americans, more and more people 
get vaccinated. One of the most impor-
tant lessons I believe we should have 
learned is the vulnerability of our sup-
ply chains, everything from personal 
protective equipment, most of which is 
made in China—and in the global race 
to get the PPE we needed during the 
pandemic, China got a head start be-
cause China manufactured it and we 
did not here at home. 
So that opened up my eyes to the 
vulnerability of that supply chain, but 
we can’t stop there. We need to look at 
how heavily we rely on other countries 
for semiconductors because nearly 90 
percent of the semiconductors in the 
world are made in Southeast Asia, with 
Taiwan dominating the market. In 
fact, one company, Taiwan Semicon-
ductor Manufacturing Company, ac-
counted for more than one-half of total 
foundry revenues last year. Companies 
in Taiwan control 63 percent of the ad-
vanced semiconductor manufacturing 
in the world. 
Now, if you are like me, before I got 
involved in this issue, I didn’t really 
know very much about semiconduc-
tors, so I asked my staff to explain to 
me the significance of this vulnerabil-
ity. They said: Well, Senator, think of 
it this way: Everything with an off and 
on switch involves semiconductors. 
Well, that helped me quite a bit. 
Then I asked them to research some-
thing for me. I said: You see those 
rockets that are raining down on Israel 
from Hamas? Some of those intercep-
tors are made by Raytheon, an Amer-
ican-based 
defense 
contractor. 
Ask 
them how many semiconductors are in 
a single interceptor. 
They did the research, and they re-
ported back—750 semiconductors in a 
single interceptor. 
So these semiconductors or micro-
electronics 
are 
everywhere, 
every-
where—in the phones we carry, in the 
planes that our Air Force, Navy, and 
Marines are flying, the fifth-generation 
stealth fighter, the F–35. Semiconduc-
tors are everywhere. Given China’s am-
bitions, it is easy to imagine how they 
might be tempted to interfere with the 
supply chain and our dependence on 
Asian-produced 
semiconductors. 
If 
China were to block or even invade 
Taiwan, we would be literally helpless. 
Back in 1980, Jimmy Carter gave a 
speech in which he laid down what 
came to be known as the Carter Doc-
trine. This was 2 years after the Soviet 
Union invaded Afghanistan. He wanted 
to send a message to the world that 
they should not mess with U.S. access 
to the oil that came through the Strait 
of Hormuz in the Middle East. 
So he laid down the Carter doctrine. 
He said: Anybody who interferes with 
our access to the oil that we need to 
power our armed services and our econ-
omy, that would be an act of war. Well, 
I don’t think it is an exaggeration to 
say if another country were to block 
our access to semiconductors, it could 
well rise to the same sort of act of war 
that Jimmy Carter warned about in 
1980. In other words, semiconductors 
have become the new oil in terms of 
our dependency, and it is a dangerous 
dependency we must correct. 
This is precisely why the senior Sen-
ator from Virginia and I, Senator WAR-
NER, introduced the CHIPS for America 
Act. It is crucial that we shore up our 
dependence 
on 
chips 
manufactured 
overseas and we shore up our domestic 
production. 
The vast majority of our colleagues 
have agreed that this is a critical task. 
It 
was 
carefully 
crafted 
after 
monthslong bipartisan, bicameral ne-
gotiations. Recently, we had a meeting 
at the White House, and President 
Biden agreed with us that this was a 
critical imperative. This is literally a 
bipartisan, bicameral agreement with 
the executive branch and legislative 
branch that this is something we need 
to fix. 
Last fall, when we took up the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, we 
introduced an amendment that author-
ized what we now hope to be able to 
pay for, which is an amendment to the 
Defense 
Authorization 
Act, 
which 
passed 96 to 4. Now we need to fund the 
program, and there is just one issue 
standing in the way. 
During committee consideration of 
the Endless Frontier Act, an amend-
ment was adopted that would apply 
controversial Davis-Bacon language to 
the underlying CHIPS for America pro-
vision signed into law last year. This 
provision creates, I believe, an unnec-
essary distraction from our focus, 
which should be on defeating this vul-
nerability in the supply chain. 
The fact is, current wages of U.S. 
semiconductor manufacturing compa-
nies don’t need Davis-Bacon. They pay 
much better than the prevailing wage 
Davis-Bacon would require. So it is 
really a nonissue when it comes to 
semiconductor manufacturing. 
But what is more significant—and I 
think the reason why some of our 
Democratic friends are insisting on 
this inclusion—is it represents an ex-
pansion over labor policies by applying 
it to private construction as opposed to 
public works. Obviously, this would set 
a troublesome precedent. 
Leaving this language in the bill, I do 
believe, has the potential to weaken 
the support for the broader legislation. 
And I hope we can all agree that the 
stakes are too high to risk letting that 
happen. 
Last week, I introduced an amend-
ment to strike this unnecessary and di-
visive provision and maintain strong 
bipartisan support for the underlying 
CHIPS for America legislation. A par-
tisan provision with zero impact is 
hardly a reason to sacrifice the strong 
bipartisan support we have seen for the 
CHIPS Act. 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
have 
worked very closely together and, I 
think, really in an encouraging and re-
sponsible way to bolster domestic man-
ufacturing of semiconductors and con-
front one of the biggest looming 
threats to our national security and 
our economic security. Now is not the 
time to backpedal on the progress we 
have made. 
I expect the Senate will vote on my 
amendment later this evening. I en-
courage my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support this amendment so 
we can maintain the strong bipartisan 
support we have demonstrated so far 
for this critical, critical legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to follow my colleague from 
Texas to talk about the very issue that 
he brought up, which is where is Amer-
ica going with semiconductor manufac-
turing, design, and development. 
On this last point, I am pretty sure 
we see things differently. I am pretty 
sure that the majority—probably all of 
the Democrats would be enthusiastic 
about supporting both manufacturing 
in the United States as well as making 
sure that if Federal dollars are used, 
prevailing wage should be applied. I am 
sure we will differ on that point. 
But I think that we are, at least on 
our side of the aisle, supportive of this 
concept that chip fabrication, chip 
manufacturing in the United States of 
America is an important sector and 
that we are facing a chip shortage and 
that we should do something about it. 
If you think about it, semiconductors 
are like the oil of the 21st century. 
They have become an essential aspect. 
They can be found in children’s toys, in 
appliances, computers, cell phones, our 
telecommunications networks, and ad-
vanced national security technology, 
as my colleague was mentioning. They 
enable 
healthcare, 
artificial 
intel-
ligence applications, financial services, 
and certainly in the area of defense. 
They have transformed how we com-
municate, how we learn, how we social-
ize. Yet they are so complex and manu-
facturing so expensive, it can cost any-
where from $5 to almost $20 billion—$20

S3847 
May 27, 2021 
billion is one number I have heard— 
just to build these facilities. This is 
why this issue has become so impor-
tant. 
The United States has had strong 
leadership in the semiconductor area, 
but massive investments from other 
nations put us at a disadvantage when 
it comes to manufacturing. They are 
subsidizing and getting tax benefits up 
to 40 percent to build in Korea than in 
the United States of America. The End-
less Frontier Act tries to address that 
because it really is a national security 
and telecommunications policy. 
In the 1990s, the United States pro-
duced over 37 percent of the global 
chips supply. As you know, here in the 
United States, we have 48 percent of 
the world’s aircraft production, but 
now with these challenges, as we look 
at the chip supply, they are down to 12 
percent. 
I noticed in the Wall Street Journal 
they said: Why do we care? Why do we 
care? They basically are saying that 
chips in fabrication have become a 
commodity and that we don’t have to 
worry about it anymore. As long as we 
are winning on the design side, we 
don’t care where it is manufactured. 
Well, if you ask me, that is so 1980s— 
I mean, the idea that you could design 
a product here and then have it manu-
factured somewhere else. Maybe that 
works with shoes or outdoor clothing, 
but it doesn’t work with something as 
sophisticated and changing as a high- 
tech innovation product like semi-
conductors. In fact, I would say, if you 
really think that type of thinking 
works, just look at what happened. It 
is 
really 
pro-COVID 
thinking. 
We 
thought we could have the design done 
here and, basically, some of these de-
vices that we use here, like ventilators, 
we will just produce them overseas. 
What could possibly go wrong? Well, we 
figured out what could go wrong. If we 
are not manufacturing ventilators here 
in the United States, something could 
go wrong, and it did. 
The question is, What is going to go 
wrong if we don’t manufacture chips in 
the United States of America? The 
thing I don’t think that the Wall 
Street Journal quite got right is that 
they don’t understand that in today’s 
innovation cycle, having a cluster of 
design, of manufacturing, of supply 
chain, of customers—everybody work-
ing together is the new way to have an 
economic advantage. 
In fact, there is a recent study done 
by a Chicago research organization. I 
am going to read from this report. Ba-
sically, it is all about clusters and why 
clusters are so important: 
An industry cluster is a group of firms, re-
lated stakeholders, and supportive institu-
tions that gain productive advantages from 
close 
geographic 
proximity 
and 
related 
economies of scale. As groups of related in-
dustries grow and develop, clustering can 
help lower business costs and increase the 
extent of benefits of specialization. Deeper 
labor pools, better access to customers and 
suppliers, knowledge spillover—these and 
other advantages are derived from an envi-
ronment of balanced competition and col-
laboration. 
I could go on. I will submit it for the 
RECORD. That is what is happening 
with semiconductors. 
The Asian market has, basically, now 
become the epicenter for this level of 
production, and the question is, Are we 
just going to forgo that and end up, ba-
sically, with not 12 percent of market 
share here but 6 percent of market 
share? Then our suppliers are going to 
continue to go where the investments 
and the energy and the ideas are. 
That is why in the United States of 
America, where we still have clusters 
in various parts of the United States— 
my colleague from Texas knows this 
well because he has a cluster in Texas. 
My colleague from Oregon, who was 
out here earlier, knows because they 
have a cluster there. There are clusters 
in places like Arizona. This is about 
whether the United States of America 
is going to continue to make this in-
vestment ourselves. 
Chips are essential to our national 
security and to telecommunications. In 
1990, we produced over 37 percent of 
global chip supply, and we need to con-
tinue to make sure that we are going 
to be an investor in chip fabrication 
today. 
Today, as I said, we are at an inflec-
tion point because of what is happening 
in a global basis. According to Gold-
man Sachs, 169 industries in the United 
States have products with embedded 
semiconductors, and there will be a 20- 
percent shortfall of components needed 
for those products. 
Last 
month, 
Caterpillar, 
headquartered in Illinois, said it an-
ticipated the chip shortage impairing 
its ability to meet growing demand of 
construction and mining equipment. 
We are not just talking about kids’ 
gaming consoles or computers. We are 
talking about many sectors of our 
economy that depend on this. 
National security experts argue that 
if there were a greater trade war or 
military conflict, the United States 
would not be able to fill its demand for 
chips for national security and critical 
infrastructure needs. 
That means people like car manufac-
turers, 
appliance 
manufacturers—if 
you think about 5G and new tech-
nology—the 
post-pandemic 
economy 
won’t be able to keep moving forward. 
The shortage also forced the auto 
sector to cut 27,000 jobs in April alone. 
Earlier this year, General Motors tem-
porarily shut down three North Amer-
ican plants due to the shortage. Ford 
cut back Michigan production of F–150s 
and the popular Explorer. And Dodge is 
reducing worker schedules in a Nevada 
plant producing the Jeep Grand Cher-
okee and Dodge Durango. These are 
having real-life impacts on us today. 
The question is, We had a ripple of 
this just because of COVID. What if we 
had a ripple of this because somebody 
decided not to supply things to us? 
These are things we have to worry 
about just in a national security per-
spective. You have to worry about 
whether we are going to get a supply 
chain that we can depend on. We really 
are at an inflection point. We are at an 
inflection point where we need to do 
something about this sector. 
One of the issues also is that chip 
fabrication and private R&D make 
huge investments. What we are talking 
about here represents a very small 
R&D investment partnership with the 
private sector as it relates to this. We 
are talking about trying to get more 
manufacturing jobs here in the United 
States. 
My colleague was just discussing this 
sector, overall, and one of the things 
that people should think about—and I 
am pretty sure people at home won’t be 
able to see this—but these jobs in pro-
duction and in various aspects of de-
sign and even on some of the other as-
pects, even in management and com-
puter, these are all well-paying jobs. 
These are jobs that, literally, are the 
types of jobs we want to be producing 
in the United States. 
I heard this story about Idaho. Mi-
cron, a big company that used to be a 
major chip fabrication—they are still 
doing chip fabrication—but the number 
of jobs in Boise, ID, has fallen off, prob-
ably in the thousands, because this 
production has gone to other places. 
Now we are replacing them with call 
center jobs. 
The question is whether we are going 
to make this investment in a key tech-
nology critical to our national secu-
rity—critical to a lot of applications of 
the technology future, whether it is 5G 
or AI or various things—and whether 
we are going to be a competitor in this 
area of a supply chain and cluster that 
continues to innovate. 
We know for a fact that semicon-
ductor jobs in the production area are 
literally $94,000 a year. That is why we 
are fighting for this because it is a sec-
tor, in just the production end, that is 
high-paying jobs. 
So are we going to spend time letting 
things go overseas and basically say-
ing, ‘‘OK, they will allow us to have 
call centers,’’ or are we going to fight 
for these high-paying jobs in the semi-
conductor space that we know will help 
us maintain our expertise and skill in 
the United States? 
I ask my colleagues to just think 
about the fact that this notion that we 
design something here and ship it over-
seas for cheap production does not fit 
this bill. That is not what we need to 
do to maintain competitiveness, in the 
information age, on something as im-
portant as semiconductors. 
I think our history is rich with peo-
ple like Thomas Edison and the Edison 
Park, which is what we established in 
New Jersey, or Menlo Park, or what 
now exists in Seattle or in various 
places. People get that innovation hap-
pens in clusters. So, if we are going to 
innovate, we have to make sure the 
United States is attracting this invest-
ment. We have to make sure that we 
are doing this here, on our shores, with 
the expertise and support.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3848 
May 27, 2021 
A lot of my colleagues might say: 
Well, do you know what? Let’s just 
have the private sector do this R&D. 
As I said, the private sector spends a 
lot on R&D. In fact, we think the pri-
vate sector spends about $377 billion a 
year on R&D. Yet, as we know, R&D 
isn’t just done by the private sector for 
its specific interest. Basic science and 
lots of advanced research and applied 
science are done by the United States. 
That is why this bill is plussing up this 
number here from the National Science 
Foundation. We had discussions here 
about plussing up the number from the 
Department of Energy. Obviously, we 
had a vote in the Senate of even in-
creasing the Defense Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency and its dollars. 
What works about the United States 
of America is that we are an eco-
system. We are not a top-down. It is 
not like we are basically the govern-
ment, saying: This is what is going to 
be done. We create an ecosystem that 
is really based on American know- 
how—our ingenuity in how to get 
things done. 
What we are asking for, as it relates 
to not only NSF funding in order to 
continue the work of R&D as it relates 
to semiconductors, is also to make sure 
that we are going to continue the focus 
of manufacturing and design and R&D 
and development and clustering and 
supply chain and companies working 
together. 
I know how important this is be-
cause, in the Seattle area, in Wash-
ington State, we are a leader in aero-
space technology. We are 49 percent, in 
the United States, of aerospace manu-
facturing. If you don’t keep manufac-
turing, do you think the supply chain 
will stay in Seattle? Do you think the 
supply chain would stay in Seattle for-
ever—all of those companies? We have 
hundreds of companies that make prod-
ucts for Boeing. Do you think they 
would stay there if it were not there? 
They will end up moving where the 
manufacturing is. 
That is what the information age is 
about, and it is certainly about that 
when it comes to technology products. 
The technology products are developed 
faster, quicker, and with the innova-
tion and the input from their cus-
tomers. That is why, if you look at 
these 
centers 
around 
the 
United 
States, they are also the places at 
which you will find the biggest users of 
this technology. They are there, and 
they are there because they want to be 
close to their customers. They want to 
understand 
their 
customers’ 
needs. 
They want to have interaction. They 
want to have collaboration. 
That is what innovation is today. In-
novation is doing design and manufac-
turing close together. That is how we 
win. That is why we need to pass this 
legislation as it relates to an invest-
ment in chip design and manufacturing 
R&D and so we continue to attract 
manufacturing in the United States. 
Back to my colleague from Texas, 
who I know agrees with this principle 
in an underlying way, when the Fed-
eral Government wants to make an in-
vestment in actual construction, we 
say that we should apply prevailing 
wage. I have talked to many of these 
people in the semiconductor manufac-
turing-design space. They say: Do you 
see how expensive it is to do these 
plans? Do you see how expensive the 
equipment is? It is very expensive; so 
we need the best workforce. So guess 
what. We pay prevailing wage. 
So we are saying, because we are put-
ting Federal dollars on the table, we 
should pay prevailing wage. They think 
we should also pay prevailing wage. I 
am not speaking for them, but, in gen-
eral, they feel like that is when they 
get their best product. 
I know where my side of the aisle is. 
We are going to be here to make an in-
vestment in this particular sector. We 
are going to figure out how to be com-
petitive against Asia in semiconductor 
manufacturing. We are going to con-
tinue, as Andy Grove said, to be para-
noid because we know that this is a 
changing landscape, and we are going 
to follow our colleagues who have made 
these decisions and make an invest-
ment for the future. 
I ask our colleagues to turn down the 
motion to strike the underlying bill, as 
the underlying bill already has this 
provision in it, and let’s get about this 
business of waiving a budget point of 
order and deciding to make the invest-
ment that we need to make to be com-
petitive in a key sector of the U.S. 
economy. If we do that, I guarantee 
you we will be well-positioned to con-
tinue to move forward, and our na-
tional security will be more secure be-
cause we will have made this decision. 
I yield the floor.

MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to 
mark Military Appreciation Month and 
to pay tribute to the many military 
members and veterans who have sac-
rificed in service to our Nation. 
This month provides an opportunity 
to show our immense gratitude to all 
those who have donned a uniform in 
our Armed Forces. The freedoms and 
blessings we enjoy as a nation have 
been secured by their hard work and 
determination. Military Appreciation 
Month culminates in Memorial Day— 
the date set aside to honor the men and 
women who have given the ultimate 
sacrifice in defense of our Nation. 
While we honor their memory on Me-
morial Day, we remember their loss 
every day and extend our gratitude to 
their loved ones, as well as to those 
who continue to serve. 
We also recognize that those who 
serve do not serve alone. The friends 
and families of those in the service of 
our country also serve, and those who 
have lost loved ones know too well the 
cost of our freedoms. I believe that we 
best honor and pay tribute to our mili-
tary members by thanking them, both 
past and present, and by ensuring they 
have the resources and support they 
have so richly earned. 
As a member of the Senate Defense 
and Veterans’ Affairs Appropriations 
Subcommittees, I have worked with 
my colleagues to ensure that our vet-
erans and military members are prop-
erly trained and equipped and receive 
the care, benefits, and recognition they 
were promised. Our servicemembers 
and their families have given much in 
defense of our Nation, and the State of 
North Dakota, especially, has a rich 
tradition of military service. 
My State is home to some of the 
country’s most premier Air Force in-
stallations, including the Minot and 
Grand Forks Air Force Bases and Cava-
lier Air Station. We have more than 
7,300 Active-Duty servicemembers who 
are currently serving in North Dakota 
and performing missions that are es-
sential to our national security. In ad-
dition, more than 4,400 men and women 
serve in the North Dakota National 
Guard. Currently, more than 53,000 vet-
erans call North Dakota home. 
We are grateful for the many service-
members and veterans who have served 
our country, and we honor their service 
every day but especially during Mili-
tary Appreciation Month. We will 
never forget the sacrifices of those who 
gave their lives so we can enjoy the 
freedoms that we are so blessed to have 
today and every day. 
TRIBUTE TO LYNN AAS AND JOHN SINN 
Mr. President, there is no better ex-
ample of service and sacrifice than that 
of our ‘‘greatest generation.’’ I would 
like to honor two World War II vet-
erans, as well as the Kiwanis Club of 
Minot, ND, of which they have both 
been 
lifelong 
members. 
This 
year 
marks the 100th anniversary of the 
Minot Kiwanis Club, as well as the 100- 
year birthdays of two Kiwanis mem-
bers, Mr. Lynn Aas and Mr. John Sinn. 
Since its founding on May 27, 1921, 
the Kiwanis Club of Minot has helped 
to make my home town, where I grew 
up, a better place to live. As a former 
member myself of this organization, I 
deeply appreciate its continued dedica-
tion and contributions to the commu-
nity and the surrounding area. Some 
examples of its work include donating 
books to schools, supporting the arts, 
and raising money for local service or-
ganizations like the Boy Scouts, the 
Juvenile Drug Court, and the Domestic 
Violence Crisis Center. In these ways, 
Minot’s local Kiwanis chapter helps re-
alize the mission of this international 
organization and makes a real dif-
ference to families and children in the 
region. 
For two individuals who have been 
lifelong members of that group, in the 
very same year the organization turns 
100, it is their 100th birthdays as well. 
As part of the ‘‘greatest generation’’ 
and as World War II veterans, Lynn 
Aas and John Sinn have both been im-
portant parts of the Minot community 
in so many ways and have set a great 
example not only in their service but

in the service they have delivered 
throughout their lives even after World 
War II. 
A native of McLean County, ND, 
Lynn Aas fought as a rifleman in the 
historic Battle of the Bulge. He served 
with the 17th Airborne Division of the 
193rd Airborne Infantry and received 
the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and 
the French Legion of Honour medal. 
Following the war, he returned to his 
home State, where he earned his law 
degree from the University of North 
Dakota. 
In 
addition 
to 
being 
a 
lifelong 
Kiwanis member, he served in our 
State’s legislature for four sessions. He 
was the president of the Minot Cham-
ber of Commerce; served on the board 
for the United Way; and has been a 
longtime supporter of Minot State Uni-
versity and of so many, many other 
worthwhile things. His family and my 
family have been friends for as long as 
I can remember—truly, a great Amer-
ican. 
Also, John Sinn—another veteran of 
World War II—has his 100th birthday as 
well. As a member of the 386th Infantry 
Regiment, John Sinn served in the Eu-
ropean theater, where he earned the 
Bronze Star. He returned home to farm 
with family members in Ryder, ND, 
eventually going to work for the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers in 1957. 
He retired in 1989, more than 30 years 
ago. However, rather than taking a 
well-earned rest, he has continued to 
serve the community as a volunteer. 
Included among his volunteer efforts, 
he is best known for his work to im-
prove and maintain the Scandinavian 
Heritage Park—a beautiful Scandina-
vian park in the community. It is truly 
an iconic outdoor museum. It is central 
to the community’s identity and is 
home to the annual Norsk Hostfest, the 
largest celebration of Scandinavian 
culture and history in North America. 
The Presiding Officer is invited any 
time he would like to come join us. It 
is a wonderful festival with wonderful 
food, and the best view of the park can 
be found at John Sinn Outlook, which 
is a testament to his many contribu-
tions. 
We recognize the hard work, dedica-
tion, and service of Lynn Aas, John 
Sinn, and the entire Minot Kiwanis 
Club as they celebrate their 100th 
birthdays this year. It is therefore ap-
propriate to take this time to recog-
nize their hard work, their dedication, 
and their service, and I have submitted 
a statement honoring that today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
S. 1260 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am 
thrilled that we are passing this legis-
lation. It is amazing to me—and I am 
sure 
the 
Presiding 
Officer 
would 
agree—that the Senate has actually re-
turned to regular order. We are passing 
amendments on both sides of the aisle, 
and I think we are going to have a big 
bipartisan vote here in the Senate. In 
having been here for a number of years 
when the Senate didn’t operate that 
way—it was incredibly dysfunctional— 
it is a great, great privilege to be here 
at a moment when it is working. So I 
want to express my sense of gratitude 
for that. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. President, I also want to call the 
Presiding Officer’s attention to news 
reports this afternoon that say that 
our colleagues on the Republican side 
of the aisle have decided they are going 
to block this bipartisan Commission to 
examine what happened on January 6 
and that they are going to use the fili-
buster here to block a Commission that 
some of them actually called for and a 
Commission that, I think, 35 Repub-
lican Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives supported. 
I wanted to come to the floor to ap-
peal to their conscience and to ask 
them to consider the damage that it 
will do to our democracy to not have 
this Commission, as we have done at 
other important moments in the coun-
try’s history. 
And, Mr. President, you were here on 
January 6. I was here on January 6. We 
had been sent here—we came here—to 
accomplish the ministerial task that 
we are required after a Presidential 
election is concluded, to certify the re-
sults of that election, to certify the 
ballots of millions and millions and 
millions of Americans who voted in the 
last election. That is why we were 
here. 
Unfortunately, we had a President at 
that time who denied that the election 
had actually happened. 
The President will remember that we 
also had colleagues that came to this 
floor and said that we were dis-
respecting the President’s base or their 
base because we were certifying the 
election, instead of having enough re-
spect for their base to tell them the 
truth, which was that the election had 
been decided by millions of voters, and 
by every court that looked at it and by 
incredibly brave local officials, many 
of them Republicans, who wouldn’t 
allow the President to push them 
around. 
The 6th was a terrible day here. The 
people who invaded this Capitol, the 
people who stormed the platform that 
had been set up for the peaceful trans-
fer of power on January 20, when Joe 
Biden took the oath of office—the peo-
ple who came here on January 6 cursed 
the Capitol Police. They bludgeoned 
the Capitol Police. They speared them. 
They hurled racial epithets, leading 
some of our African-American police 
officers here to ask what had happened 
to America. They broke windows in the 
Capitol. They looted the Parliamentar-
ian’s office—the people who would 
bravely carry the ballots out of this 
Chamber, when we were led to the Hart 
building, and protect those ballots that 
could have ended up getting burned out 
on the National Mall, if they hadn’t 
had the presence of mind to do their 
job—just like the Capitol Police, who 
were in mortal danger that day doing 
their job. 
And I remember, when we were all 
together in one of the Senate office 
buildings, after they had rushed us out 
of here, we would later see that the 
mob was just a hallway away from 
here, and, actually, they were mis-
directed by another Capitol Police offi-
cer, who put his life in jeopardy to 
move them out of the way. 
We were taken to another building, a 
Senate office building, and it was in 
that room—we were crowded in that 
room. It was in that room that I saw a 
scene that I never thought I would ever 
see as an American, on the TV sets 
that were on the walls of that room. 
While we were inside the room, we were 
watching the scene that everyone else 
in the country and everyone else across 
the world was watching of the U.S. 
Capitol being invaded by our own peo-
ple. 
I know the President will remember 
that when he was growing up, when I 
was growing up, that was not an un-
common sight to see in countries all 
over the world. There are a lot of coun-
tries that have had events like January 
6 over the world, especially when there 
have been transitions of power or a ty-
rant unwilling to give up their power. 
But in a million years, I would never 
have imagined that it would happen 
here. And it did happen, and it sent a 
message all over the planet. 
While we were in that room, unable 
to certify this election, the Chinese 
Government had the greatest propa-
ganda win that you could imagine, and 
in the weeks that followed, they have 
said democracy is in decline, democ-
racy is failing. That is what the Rus-
sians are saying. That is what the Ira-
nians are saying. 
And when I was there in that room 
that day, I thought a lot about my 
mom and her parents, who were Polish 
Jews, who survived the Holocaust. The 
whole family was killed except for 
them and an aunt, and they were lucky 
enough that, after the war was over, 
they went to Stockholm, Sweden, for a 
year. They went to Mexico City for a 
year, and then they came here to the 
only country in the world where they 
thought they could rebuild their shat-
tered lives. And they did. 
And so even worse for me than the 
thought of our adversaries using this 
to undermine democracy was the un-
derstanding that people all over the 
world situated just like my mom and 
her parents would lose hope in the 
American ideal, would lose hope in de-
mocracy and in the rule of law. 
Now, the good news is we actually 
had a January 20. A lot of countries 
that go through January 6 never get to 
January 20, and we had that, and Joe 
Biden took the oath of office and he be-
came President of the United States, 
and KAMALA HARRIS became the Vice 
President of the United States. We had, 
notwithstanding all of the prior Presi-
dent’s efforts to the contrary and the 
efforts of some of his allies in Congress

to the contrary—we had—a peaceful 
transfer of power. 
But consider how close we came, not 
just on the 6th, but consider what 
would have happened if elected offi-
cials, many of them Republicans in 
Georgia and in Arizona and in Michi-
gan hadn’t fulfilled their obligations to 
the rule of law, hadn’t lived up to their 
oath of office, bent to the will of a 
President who didn’t want to relin-
quish power. Where would we be then? 
Imagine if the Democrats, instead of 
winning a narrow majority in the 
House of Representatives, had lost the 
majority in the House of Representa-
tives, and 140 or more—148—Republican 
votes to decertify the election, to over-
turn the will of the voters, to dis-
enfranchise millions and millions and 
millions of Americans all of a sudden 
was a majority doing that, as the 
former President would have wanted. 
Imagine if 60 judges, many of them 
Republicans, appointed by President 
Trump, who howled the President’s 
lawyers out of courtroom after court-
room, after courtroom because, instead 
of doing what the President wanted 
them to do, instead of finding them ‘‘a 
few more votes,’’ as he said to the sec-
retary of state in Georgia, recorded on 
the phone, they did their job as judges 
and they withstood the pressure. They 
swore an oath, and they fulfilled their 
oath, and that is the only way democ-
racy can actually work. It is when 
elected officials and judicial officials 
apply the rule of law, fulfill their oath 
and their obligation. 
And what I want to say to my col-
leagues today, I want to implore them 
and appeal to their conscience, because 
the responsibility to the democracy is 
not over. The democracy is still at 
risk. We still have a President of the 
United States—a former President— 
who refuses to concede the election, 
who, on a daily basis almost, says that 
the election was stolen. We still have 
Members of Congress who are saying 
the election was stolen. We still have 
Members of Congress who won’t face 
the facts and tell their constituents 
the truth. 
I want to say again: Respect your 
constituents enough that you are going 
to tell them the truth, and that is why, 
at difficult moments in our history, 
like 
after 
President 
Kennedy 
was 
killed or the Challenger exploded or 9/ 
11 happened, we have had a bipartisan 
Commission to make sure we under-
stood what led us here and how we can 
do better coming out of this. 
It has never been perfect, but it has 
worked pretty well, and that is what 
we need here. We need to understand 
what led millions of Americans to be-
lieve conspiracy theories about our 
own country and what led thousands of 
people to storm the Capitol of the 
United States, to attack police offi-
cers, to attack police officers, leading 
to their death. 
From all over the country, they came 
to invade this Capitol, and if we don’t 
want it to happen again or we want to 
be able to protect ourselves, and I am 
not just talking about the poor Capitol 
Police, although that, at a bare min-
imum, ought to be enough to warrant a 
Commission. I am talking about the 
danger of political violence in this Na-
tion going forward if we don’t address 
this and the American people don’t 
have the chance to understand what 
happened. 
As I mentioned, that night on Janu-
ary 6, standing at this desk on the 
floor, political violence is what brings 
these republics to an end. 
I am going to finish because I know 
there are others who want to speak, 
but let me just finish by saying how 
agonizing it was to watch Officer 
Sicknick’s mom here today, going door 
to door to door, to ask people: Please 
vote for this Commission. 
I hope that people will reconsider. I 
hope they will search their conscience. 
The people around the world who 
watched January 6 are watching us 
today, and they want to know if de-
mocracy is up to the challenges of the 
21st century. 
I believe it is. I believe it is. I think 
democracy is the highest expression of 
humanity on Earth, and we are being 
tested in all kinds of ways right now, 
externally and internally. This would 
give us the chance to at least deal with 
the internal question. And I think at a 
moment like this it is important for us 
not to stand for a party or for a Presi-
dent but for the truth and for common 
sense and for our exercise in self-gov-
ernment. 
For all of those reasons, I hope that 
when we have the vote tonight, that it 
will succeed and the American people 
will have the benefit of a bipartisan 
Commission to examine what happened 
on January 6 and help us understand 
how we can strengthen our democracy. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 478 AND S. 
789 EN BLOC 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate has a solemn duty to exercise and 
fulfill U.S. Federal trust responsibility. 
This duty is the guiding principle for 
all our work on behalf of American In-
dians, Alaska Natives, and Native Ha-
waiians. So as the chairman of the Sen-
ate Committee on Indian Affairs, it is 
my job to prioritize and push Tribal 
and Native communities’ legislative 
priorities toward the finish line and ul-
timately to actually enact legislation. 
The Indian Affairs Committee has a 
strong 
tradition 
of 
bipartisanship 
going back decades. Committee Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle routinely 
work together to achieve their own Na-
tive communities’ goals. When there 
are disagreements, we do everything 
we can to work them out internally 
and to find common ground so that 
Members aren’t forced to air their dis-
agreements when bills get to the floor. 
In fact, just last night, the Senate 
passed eight Indian Affairs bills unani-
mously. Those bills would, among 
other things, promote economic devel-
opment, protect Native children, honor 
Tribal self-determination—goals that 
we all agreed take important steps to-
ward fulfilling our shared Federal trust 
responsibilities. Time and again, we 
have shown that the Indian Affairs 
bills can rise above partisan logjams. 
That compromise can be found. But 
here we are. 
H.R. 478, which passed the House on 
May 12, 2021, under suspension of the 
rules, would help to rebuild Tribal 
homelands; and S. 789, which passed 
the Senate unanimously in late No-
vember 2019, would repeal 11 obsolete, 
racist, unenforced laws that are incon-
sistent with the current government- 
to-government relationship enjoyed by 
the United States and Indian Tribes. 
Both bills would likely be laws by 
now if the COVID–19 pandemic had not 
disrupted our legislative work last 
year. These bills are good policy. That 
is why both Republican and Demo-
cratic administrations support them. 
And the Senate should have passed 
these bills last night, but because there 
was an objection to their inclusion in 
the 10-bill package, we find ourselves 
here again. The Indian Affairs Com-
mittee, as is tradition, has negotiated 
in good faith to clear up any concerns 
there may be, but those efforts were 
not successful, which leads me to this 
moment. 
When it comes to fulfilling the U.S. 
trust responsibility, there is no room 
for partisanship. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of the following bills en 
bloc: Calendar No. 59, H.R. 478, the 
Blackwater Trading Post Land Trans-
fer Act; and Calendar No. 53, S. 789, the 
RESPECT Act; further, that the bills 
be considered read a third time and 
passed en bloc and the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table en bloc, with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, one of the bills in 
question—specifically, H.R. 478, would 
direct the Secretary of the Interior to 
take 55.3 acres of land owned by the 
Gila River Indian Community into 
trust. 
The Gila River Indian Community 
Reservation 
is 
already 
583 
square 
miles, with a population of 11,000. The 
Gila River Indian Community already 
owns this land, so why we need to take 
more land into trust and have the Fed-
eral Government more involved in the 
management of the land is not imme-
diately obvious or apparent to me. The 
answer is not at all clear as to why it 
needs to be in trust. 
Trust land responsibilities for the 
Federal Government are significant 
and before we expand the size of our 
trust lands, we have to have an under-
standing of what we are doing and the 
actual need to do it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3851 
May 27, 2021 
Proponents of this legislation have 
claimed that the Tribe has a unique 
history with this particular plot of 
land—this 
particular 
55.3 
acres 
of 
land—adjacent to the trust land. But 
from the history shown, the Tribe’s 
interaction with the land is mostly 
that they have had friendly neighbors 
with whom they have traded goods. 
As many of my colleagues are aware, 
I have great concerns that I have quite 
consistently expressed with further ex-
panding 
the 
Federal 
Government’s 
management or involvement in public 
lands, including trust lands. 
Nevertheless, I have been engaging in 
negotiations, and I have made a num-
ber of good-faith efforts to develop a 
possible path forward—one in which 
the amount of acreage owned or held in 
trust 
by 
the 
Federal 
Government 
would not grow, while taking this land 
into trust for the Gila River Indian 
Community. While I continue to nego-
tiate a path forward, I am not inclined 
to abandon this concern. This is a ne-
gotiation that has been in progress. 
That said, with respect to the part of 
the request dealing specifically with S. 
789, the RESPECT Act, I am willing to 
let that go. But if the request is to pass 
both of these by unanimous consent, I 
can’t support that, and on that basis, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, a couple 
of points. On taking 55.3 acres into 
trust, this is not like the Federal Gov-
ernment is going to have new land 
management responsibilities. This is a 
matter of principle for the Senator 
from Utah, and I recognize that; that 
he thinks, basically, no additional land 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
trust, 
even 
though this government-to-government 
relationship—this authority over these 
government 
relationships 
are 
en-
shrined in the Constitution of the 
United States and this government-to- 
government relationship has already 
been established by statutory law and 
the process for putting land into trust 
is already a well-established pathway. 
But what the Senator from Utah is say-
ing is no more or we are going to have 
to do a one-for-one swap or even some-
times a two-for-one swap. You cannot 
have a net increase in the acreage, 
even if it is 53 acres, even if there is an 
established process. 
And so, I do find that difficult to 
work with. I know that the Senators 
from Arizona are in discussions with 
the Senator from Utah. 
We will find our way forward. This is 
53 acres. It is important, obviously. We 
are going to enact this legislation. 
I like the Senator from Utah. We will 
find a way on this one. 
But if he would entertain an amend-
ment to the request, then I would be 
pleased to pass the RESPECT Act by 
voice vote, if that is something that 
the Senator from Utah would be ame-
nable to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. I fully am amenable to 
that, with the RESPECT Act.

unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 53, S. 789. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 789) to repeal certain obsolete 
laws relating to Indians. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
Mr. SCHATZ. I know of no further 
debate on the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate and the bill having 
been read the third time, the question 
is, Shall the bill pass?

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

S. 1260 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it 
will come as no surprise to anyone in 
this Chamber that I am extremely 
proud to be born and raised in Michi-
gan. 
Our State leads the world in innova-
tion. We are the leaders in making 
things—furniture, appliances, wind tur-
bines and solar components and so 
much more, and, of course, we are the 
home of the automobile and the auto-
motive assembly line and the middle 
class of America. 
Our workers put the world on four 
wheels. They built an economy strong 
enough that those same workers could 
afford to buy one or two or more cars 
and trucks that they made. 
Yet our Nation faces a stark choice 
right now, and that is why the bill in 
front of us tonight is so very impor-
tant. We can continue to invest in 
making things in America or we can 
decide that it is not really worth the 
trouble anymore. 
We can continue to lead the world in 
the research and development of break-
through technologies or we can allow 
other countries to surge ahead while 
we tread water. And we can stand with 
our workers on the assembly lines as 
they build the vehicles of the future or 
we can watch our plants close, ship our 
jobs overseas, and let our middle class 
wither away—our choice. 
But I would argue that we may have 
no choice. That is no choice at all. We 
know what we need to do. It is time to 
stand on the side of American manu-
facturing, as this bill does. It is time to 
stand on the side of American inge-
nuity, as this bill does. And it is time 
to stand on the side of American work-
ers and our American middle class. 
It is time to take a stand and invest 
in our shared future and build an econ-
omy that can compete with anyone, 
anywhere, anytime. That is America. 
That is what the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act does. 
One of our first orders of business is 
to increase our investments in research 
and development, and we have no time 
to lose. American R&D spending is

near the lowest point in 60 years—low-
est point in 60 years. What else hap-
pened 60 years ago? Well, the first per-
son flew into space, and he wasn’t an 
American. That fact helped light a fire 
under American leaders. They under-
stood that we could invest in R&D or 
let the Soviet Union surge ahead, and 
we did. 
Today, we are in a race with China, 
and they are gaining on us. In 2019, Chi-
na’s investment in R&D grew by about 
13 percent. Ours grew 8 percent. And 
they plan to boost R&D spending by 7 
percent each year through 2025. 
That is why it is so important that 
we pass the U.S. Innovation and Com-
petition Act. It will invest $120 billion 
over 5 years in critical—critical—re-
search, 
including 
artificial 
intel-
ligence, 
advanced 
computing, 
and 
semiconductors. And it will quadruple 
the investment for the manufacturing 
extension partnership and provides $1.2 
billion for the Manufacturing USA Pro-
gram that is especially important to 
Michigan. 
We are proud to have two Manufac-
turing USA initiatives in our State— 
Lightweight Innovations for Tomor-
row, or LIFT, and Michigan State Uni-
versity’s Scale-up Research Facility, or 
SURF. Both are located in the same fa-
cility in Detroit, and it is a very excit-
ing place. 
LIFT’s projects include research into 
better welding processes for Navy ships 
and an anti-rollover system for mili-
tary humvees. SURF is partnering with 
the Department of Energy and Ford 
and GM to make sure that America is 
a leader in advanced vehicle tech-
nologies. 
We are equally proud of our amazing 
research institutions, including Michi-
gan State University, the University of 
Michigan, Wayne State, and Michigan 
Tech. 
Today’s students are tomorrow’s en-
gineers. We know that. We are count-
ing on their brain power to build a fu-
ture in which cars are connected and 
collisions are a memory. That future is 
being written today at the American 
Center for Mobility in Michigan and 
Mcity at the University of Michigan, 
where connected and automated vehi-
cles are tested, evaluated, and dem-
onstrated. It is really amazing to see. 
It is being written by Michigan auto-
makers, who are working towards the 
day where cars are emission-free— 
emission-free. I know that President 
Biden was impressed by Ford’s new F– 
150 Lightning that he test drove in 
Michigan last week. I think it was hard 
to get him out of the car. He thought it 
was so cool. 
Last month, I toured GM’s new Fac-
tory Zero, which will soon be manufac-
turing electric Hummers and Silverado 
trucks, Chevy Silverado trucks. In De-
troit, Stellantis, formerly known as 
Chrysler, is gearing up to build hybrid 
electric versions of an iconic American 
vehicle, the Jeep. It is what we have al-
ways done in Michigan. We make 
things, and we grow things. That is 
what we do. 
Unfortunately, making things has 
gotten more difficult recently. COVID– 
19 exposed the weaknesses in our sup-
ply chain, and a shortage of semi-
conductors has idled multiple auto 
plants across the country and many in 
Michigan. Auto dealers that are nor-
mally packed with every make and 
model under the Sun suddenly have 
fewer choices. Worse, Michigan work-
ers have been laid off—no chips, no 
cars, no work. 
It is not enough to just build cars 
that are made in America. To remain 
competitive in the global marketplace, 
we need to build the component parts 
that go into the cars and trucks that 
we build in America—the supply chain. 
In 1990, 37 percent of global semicon-
ductor manufacturing capacity was 
here in the United States—37 percent. 
Today, it is 12 percent. They are defi-
nitely going in the wrong direction, 
and this is very serious. And the impor-
tance of these chips keep growing. 
Other countries have invested in chip 
manufacturing. It is time we do the 
same. The U.S. Innovation and Com-
petition Act provides $39 billion in the 
Commerce Department for incentives 
that will boost semiconductor manu-
facturing in the United States and 
make our supply chain more resilient. 
It includes $2 billion to incentivize the 
production of mature semiconductor 
technologies—the kinds of chips used 
by our auto companies and home appli-
ances and defense manufacturing. 
I am pleased that yesterday the Fi-
nance Committee passed the Clean En-
ergy for America Act, which will help 
Michigan and our country launch the 
next generation of Michigan manufac-
turing. It includes my bipartisan legis-
lation with Senator MANCHIN and Sen-
ator DAINES to help companies invest 
in new clean energy manufacturing fa-
cilities and expand existing plants to 
build those new technologies, including 
semiconductors 
and 
battery 
oper-
ations. 
Another way we can boost American 
manufacturing is to make sure every 
single American taxpayer dollar pos-
sible is spent on American-made prod-
ucts. My bipartisan Make it in America 
Act with Senator WARREN makes it 
harder for Federal Agencies to use 
waivers or loopholes to get around 
‘‘Buy American’’ rules to purchase for-
eign-made products. I also want to 
thank TAMMY
BALDWIN
and Senator 
SHERROD
BROWN
for their continued 
leadership on these ‘‘Buy American’’ 
issues. 
The Federal Government is an enor-
mous consumer, and we are set to 
make big infrastructure investments. 
‘‘Buy American’’ rules means that 
American dollars flow into local econo-
mies when we purchase American-made 
PPE, American-made iron and steel, 
and great American electric vehicles. 
It is time to invest in the research 
and development that turn American 
ingenuity into American innovation 
and U.S. ingenuity into U.S. innova-
tion. It is time to build an American 
supply chain that can build American 
products and American jobs in Amer-
ican communities. And it is time to en-
sure that American tax dollars are sup-
porting those businesses and those 
workers. 
I am proud to say Michigan workers 
built our Nation. It is time for our Na-
tion to return the favor. The bill this 
evening on the floor is a critical step 
forward in making sure that happens. 
I yield the floor.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER

OSSOFF). The Senator from Illinois. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
week, something happened here in the 
Capitol which was unique. I am not 
sure it has ever happened before. It was 
reported that an anonymous group of 
Capitol Police officers published an 
open letter to Members of Congress. 
I have been here a few years. I never 
heard of anything quite like this. Here 
is what these Capitol Police officers, 
who are entrusted with the responsi-
bility of keeping us safe in the Capitol, 
wrote: ‘‘On Jan 6th where some officers 
served their last day in US Capitol Po-
lice uniform, and not by choice, we 
would hope that Members whom we 
took an oath to protect, would at the 
very minimum support an investiga-
tion to get to the bottom of EVERY-
ONE responsible and hold them 100 per-
cent accountable no matter the title of 
position they hold or held.’’ 
A challenge from the Capitol Police 
to the Members of Congress not to 
sweep under the carpet January 6 but 
to get to the bottom of it. Capitol po-
licemen were attacked and died as a re-
sult of that insurrectionist mob on 
January 6, and these officers, who risk 
their lives every day for us, are begging 
us not to ignore what happened. 
Yesterday, in POLITICO, the mother 
of fallen Capitol Police Officer Brian 
Sicknick wrote: ‘‘Not having a January 
6 Commission to look into exactly 
what occurred is a slap in the faces of 
all the officers who did their jobs that 
day.’’ 
I met Gladys Sicknick when the me-
morial to her son was held in the Ro-
tunda. I talked to her and her husband 
about their son, how they were worried 
when he decided to become a police-
man, but they thought at least if he 
worked in the U.S. Capitol, it is a pret-
ty safe assignment. Well, he died the 
day after January 6, many believe from 
complications which occurred in the 
attacks of that day. 
To Gladys Sicknick, to the Sicknick 
family, to all of our Capitol Police offi-
cers to whom we entrust our lives 
every day, and to the members of the 
DC Metro Police and the other heroes 
who defended the Capitol on January 6, 
I say: We hear you, and you deserve 
justice. 
It is hard to believe that before we 
adjourn today, we are likely to con-
sider a January 6 Commission proposal 
that is doomed to fail. Imagine, the 
worst attack on this building since the 
War of 1812, and sadly, it has become a

May 27, 2021 
partisan issue. It is my understanding 
because of his public announcement 
that Senator MCCONNELL is going to 
oppose it, and I understand that his 
caucus will follow his lead. 
It is hard to imagine what is going on 
in the U.S. Congress these days. 
Earlier this week, a Member of the 
House of Representatives—I am afraid 
she is already notorious for her inflam-
matory rhetoric—likened coronavirus 
masking guidelines to the Holocaust— 
the Holocaust. I feel no need to point 
out the absurdity, if not the anti-Se-
mitic nature of such a comparison, but 
I do want to point out that that com-
parison was made by one of the law-
makers who were party to the January 
6 insurrection attack on the Capitol. 
The day before the insurrection, that 
same Congresswoman, a Republican 
Congresswoman, tweeted: ‘‘Tomorrow 
is an important day in American his-
tory. The people will remember the Pa-
triots who stood for election integrity. 
Let’s go #FightForTrump!’’ 
And fight they did. 
I remember being in the Chamber 
that day. I still remember the sound of 
rioters banging on the doors and win-
dows of this building, the sight of hun-
dreds of them lined up outside, the dis-
gusting display of Confederate flags. 
And the violence we saw that left 5 
people dead and 139 law enforcement of-
ficers attacked. 
So many shocking sights on January 
6, 2021—a gallows was erected on the 
Capitol lawn and rioters attacking po-
lice officers with flagpoles bearing 
American flags or Trump flags. 
One of the most painful images—and 
I am sure it was more painful to some 
than even to me—is a photo of a mid-
dle-age White man standing in the 
halls 
of 
our 
Capitol 
wearing 
a 
sweatshirt that read ‘‘Camp Ausch-
witz.’’ Below those repugnant words 
was another set of words: ‘‘Work makes 
you free.’’ That cruel slogan was em-
blazoned atop the black iron gates in 
Germany leading into the Auschwitz 
concentration camp. And one of the ri-
oters—mobsters—on January 6 in the 
U.S. Capitol boldly wore that shirt. 
These are the people who stormed the 
Capitol on January 6. They weren’t Pa-
triots by any measure. Included in 
their ranks were neo-Nazis, White su-
premacists, and clear enemies of the 
United States. They were incited by 
the former President of the United 
States, Donald Trump, at a rally ear-
lier that day, and his allies in Con-
gress, like that Congresswoman I men-
tioned earlier, were party to the incite-
ment as well. 
I agree with those who have said that 
an 
insurrection 
without 
con-
sequences—without even an examina-
tion—is a dress rehearsal for the next 
insurrection. That is why we cannot 
sweep January 6 and the events that 
led to it under the rug. 
Incendiary rhetoric, especially from 
the mouths or the keyboards of elected 
officials, has a cost. 
Comparing mask requirements in a 
pandemic to the Holocaust has a cost 
as well. It belittles the worst genocide 
in the history of the world. And it en-
courages the kinds of anti-Semitic at-
tacks we have seen in recent days and 
weeks, like the vandalism in my home 
State at the synagogue in Skokie, IL. 
Baselessly claiming that the Presi-
dential election of last year was stolen 
and repeating that lie has a cost. It un-
dermines the faith in our government 
and legitimizes a radical, anti-govern-
ment movement that aims to over-
throw this government. 
It is time for us to tally up the costs, 
understand how the January 6 attack 
on our democracy happened and who 
incited 
it, 
and 
that 
investigation 
should not be a matter of controversy. 
It is part of our obligation, is it not? 
By our oath of office to defend this 
Constitution from all enemies, foreign 
and domestic? Future generations are 
counting on us to record in detail what 
did happen on January 6. And we ought 
to do it on a bipartisan basis. 
But why is it necessary? With all of 
the videotapes and all of the photos 
and all of the statements of 400-plus 
people already arrested, why do we 
need to keep asking questions about 
that day? Because just 2 weeks ago, 
two different Republican Congressmen 
proclaimed that those who were in the 
Capitol that day were somehow peace-
ful patriots. That was the phrase that 
was used—peaceful patriots. Another 
one talked about them and believed the 
videotapes proved they were just or-
derly tourists—orderly tourists. At-
tacking police officers; five people died; 
crashing through the windows and 
doors; breaking down offices; dese-
crating this Chamber with their antics 
captured on videotape, and we have all 
seen them. Orderly tourists? Not by 
any measure. 
We ought to investigate this on a bi-
partisan basis. Several Republican Sen-
ators have agreed. Thirty-five Members 
of 
the 
House 
Republican 
caucus 
thought so as well. Surely, all of us can 
appreciate the importance of working 
together to investigate why, for the 
first time in history, America was 
challenged when we were in the process 
of the peaceful transfer of power. 
Here is the thing that I don’t under-
stand. Several of us in leadership were 
asked to leave the Capitol complex and 
go to a separate place. The identity of 
that location is kept confidential and 
private. But it was an interesting gath-
ering of Democratic and Republican 
leaders in the wake of the January 6 
insurrection which was underway as we 
were taken to the separate location. 
And I looked around at the Demo-
cratic as well as the Republican leaders 
from the Senate and the House who 
were gathered, and it was clear to me— 
they say they felt the same feelings of 
anger and outrage that this mob had 
desecrated this building. And they were 
determined—we were all determined— 
that the mob would not have the last 
word. We were determined to return to 
this Capitol that same day and finish 
our work counting the electoral college 
votes that declared Joe Biden Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Calls were being made in every direc-
tion to police, to the military, to polit-
ical leaders: Resecure this Capitol. 
Make certain that you remove those 
people who were responsible for the vi-
olence and insurrection we have seen. 
Let us get back to our work. Let us 
prove to the American people that the 
mob didn’t have the last word. 
I saw that bipartisan determination, 
and I felt damn good about it. Of all 
the differences we have had, of all the 
debate we have had, January 6, that 
afternoon, Democratic and Republican 
leaders 
were 
standing 
shoulder 
to 
shoulder, passing cellphones back and 
forth, and speaking to our leaders, 
talking about getting back into this 
Capitol and throwing that mob out. 
And it happened. 
By 8 o’clock that evening, we were 
back on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
By 2:30, we were gone, racing through 
the exit doors. At 8 o’clock, we were 
back to prove that they didn’t have the 
last word. But, sadly, we know now 
they may have the last word because 
the call for a bipartisan commission to 
investigate this January 6 event and to 
put on the record exactly what hap-
pened is being opposed on a partisan 
basis. 
There ought to be 100 Senate votes 
for investigating this attack and mak-
ing a clear record for history so that 
those who mock the danger of the mo-
ment by calling this mob a peaceful, 
patriotic mob, or calling the members 
orderly tourists don’t have the last 
word; yet we may not even have 60 
votes today when the measure is 
called. Why? Let’s get down to basics 
here. 
Many of the Republican Members are 
afraid of the man who incited this mob. 
They are afraid of the former President 
and what he will say of them if we call 
for an investigation. They are afraid of 
Donald Trump. As a result, they are re-
fusing to let this Commission move for-
ward. Are they worried that this inves-
tigation into what happened on Janu-
ary 6 will hurt Republicans in next 
year’s election? I think the position 
they are taking opposing an investiga-
tion will hurt them. 
The events of that date are not fod-
der for political campaigns, really. 
They are a stain on our history. If we 
ignore them or allow the history of 
that day to be rewritten by deniers, 
shame on them. 
The events of January 6 deserve and 
demand careful, thorough, and prin-
cipled examination. That is why the 
independent Commission we are pro-
posing is modeled after the same inves-
tigatory body that was created after 
9/11. It will be led by 10 commissioners, 
evenly divided between Democrats and 
Republicans. Together, they would be 
called on to produce a definitive ac-
count of what happened and led to Jan-
uary 6, 2021. This is not an opportunity 
to score political points; it is an oppor-
tunity to score national unity and rec-
onciliation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3854 
May 27, 2021 
When Senator MCCONNELL, the Re-
publican Senate leader, announced his 
opposition to this Commission last 
week, he said: ‘‘It’s not at all clear 
what new facts or additional investiga-
tion yet another commission can lay 
on top of the existing efforts by law en-
forcement and Congress.’’ 
My response to Senator MCCONNELL 
is this, respectfully: The public serv-
ants who lead this Commission will be 
charged with a different set of respon-
sibilities than law enforcement and 
Members of Congress. The investiga-
tions being led by intelligence officials 
and members of law enforcement are 
criminal investigations. They will de-
termine how the individuals who par-
ticipated in the insurrection should be 
held legally accountable. And the ongo-
ing investigation in Congress have 
largely been focused on our govern-
ment’s response to the violence of Jan-
uary 6, not to what provoked it. 
The Commission we are considering 
today is different. It will be com-
prehensive by design, evenly divided on 
a partisan basis. It will examine all of 
the factors that inspired that riotous 
mob. And this Commission isn’t just 
about uncovering truth. It goes back to 
the point I made opening this state-
ment. This Commission is designed to 
honor the police officers who defended 
us and defended this Capitol on Janu-
ary 6, some of whom gave their lives in 
the process. 
That letter from the police officers 
to us is a reminder that we owe them 
the same loyalty and the same dedica-
tion they give to us every single day. 
Dismissing this January 6 Commission 
and the gravity of this responsibility, 
sadly, does not honor the police offi-
cers who are prepared to give their 
lives for us every single day. 
Here is a chance for my Republican 
colleagues to prove that they really 
care about law enforcement. So many 
speeches on the floor of the Senate in 
the last several weeks have derided and 
criticized 
people 
for 
calling 
on 
defunding the police. Well, I would tell 
them that the failure to create a Com-
mission to objectively determine what 
happened when so many of our police 
officers were attacked on January 6, 
that doesn’t defund the police; failing 
to create that Commission, sadly, de-
fames them. And that is unacceptable 
by any standard. 
Isn’t it time we stand with the police 
officers and their request for this Com-
mission? Isn’t it time we make sure 
that heroes like Brian Sicknick and his 
family know that he did not die in 
vain? He paid the ultimate sacrifice to 
protect us. Let’s honor it by supporting 
the creation of an independent Com-
mission. His family, and all of Amer-
ica, deserve nothing less than the 
truth. 
MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. PRESIDENT, this Memorial Day 
weekend, we pause to remember and 
honor the patriots who paid for our 
freedoms with their lives. They fell in 
battles from Bunker Hill to the Bulge 
to Baghdad. Today, they are laid to 
rest throughout the world—from na-
tional cemeteries and other hallowed 
grounds in America to the cliffs of Nor-
mandy and far beyond. 
Nearly 20 years ago, a new generation 
of American service members went off 
to fight a war in an ancient land. They 
traveled to Afghanistan to hunt down 
the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks and 
the government that had given him 
sanctuary. Few imagined then that Af-
ghanistan would become America’s 
longest war. 
There are Americans serving today in 
Afghanistan who were not yet born on 
9/11. There are veterans who served in 
Afghanistan in the early years who 
have seen their own children go off to 
fight in that war. 
President Biden recently announced 
the last U.S. troops in Afghanistan will 
be home by September 11th—the 20th 
anniversary of the terrorist attacks on 
America that spurred the war. 
I support the President’s decision. 
While there are legitimate concerns 
about protecting social gains made in 
Afghanistan, and we must bring home 
Americans detained in Afghanistan, 
like Mark Frerichs from my State, it is 
time for America’s longest war to end. 
On this final Memorial Day with U.S. 
troops in Afghanistan, we remember 
especially 
the 
2,312 
U.S. 
servicemembers who died in that war 
and the families they leave behind. 
SSG Jacob Frazier is one of those 
fallen heroes. His friends called him 
Jake. 
He grew up in Ohio, and in St. 
Charles, the son of a Marine who 
fought in Vietnam, and the eldest of 
five siblings. 
He was 18 years old in 1997—just a few 
months out of high school—when he 
enlisted in the Illinois Air National 
Guard and was assigned to the 169th 
Air Support Operations Squadron of 
the 182nd Airlift Wing in Peoria. 
In 2003, he was in Afghanistan, work-
ing alongside Army Special Forces. His 
job was to call in air cover to protect 
troops on the ground. On March 29th of 
that year, Jake Frazier and Special 
Forces soldiers were returning from a 
meeting with Tribal leaders in the 
Helmand province when their convoy 
was attacked by Taliban fighters. Staff 
Sergeant Frazier and a Special Forces 
solider were killed. 
Jake Frazier was the 75th American 
service member—and the first Illinois 
service member—to die in combat in 
Afghanistan. He was 24 years old and 
engaged to be married. 
I want to tell you, also, about an-
other fallen hero from an earlier war. 
Army CPL Asa Vance grew up in Deca-
tur, IL, one of 14 siblings. His friends 
called him Bud. 
He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1950 
at the age of 18 and was sent to Korea. 
On November 24 GEN MacArthur or-
dered what would become known as the 
‘‘Home by Christmas’’ offensive. U.N. 
forces, he said, would push Chinese 
troops out of Korea, reunite North and 
South Korea, and be home by Christ-
mas. What happened was very dif-
ferent. Three days after MacArthur’s 
pronouncement, 120,000 Chinese troops 
surrounded 
30,000 
U.N 
troops 
near 
North Korea’s Chosin Reservoir. The 
next 2 weeks brought some of the most 
brutal combat in modern warfare his-
tory. On December 2, at the height of 
the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, 
CPL Asa Vance was killed. He was 18 
years old. For nearly 70 years, his re-
mains stayed in North Korea. 
Following a 2018 meeting between the 
leaders of North Korea and the United 
States, however, North Korea returned 
55 
boxes 
of 
remains 
of 
U.S. 
servicemembers 
killed 
during 
war. 
DNA tests ultimately proved that Cor-
poral Vance’s remains were among 
them. Two weeks ago, this son of 
smalltown 
Illinois 
finally 
returned 
home. All 13 of his siblings had already 
passed on. But Asa Vance was not 
alone. 
As an honor guard of police officers, 
sheriffs deputies, State troopers and 
members of the Illinois Patriot Honor 
Guard led his remains from St. Louis’s 
Lambert International Airport to a 
memorial service in his hometown of 
Decatur and onto his final resting at 
Camp Butler National Cemetery in 
Springfield. Hundreds of folks who 
never knew CPL Asa Vance came out 
to pay their respects. They stood on 
street corners and highway overpasses 
with their hands on their hearts. Many 
held small American flags, some wiped 
away tears. 
Archibald MacLeish was a son of Illi-
nois, a poet laureate of the United 
States, and a soldier in World War I. 
Decades after that war, he wrote about 
the soldiers who do not come home: 
The young dead soldiers do not speak. 
Nevertheless, they are heard in the still 
houses: 
Who has not heard them? 
They have a silence that speaks for them at 
night and when the clock counts. 
They say: We were young. We have died. Re-
member us. 
They say: Our deaths are not ours: they are 
yours, 
They will mean what you make them. 
We leave you our deaths. Give them their 
meaning. 
SSG 
Jake 
Frazier’s 
father, 
Jim 
Frazier, honors his son’s sacrifice by 
working with other Gold Star families 
who have lost loved ones in wars. 
On this Memorial Day, we would do 
well to ask: How can we honor those 
who gave all for our Nation? How can 
give meaning to their deaths? 
In addition to keeping our promises 
to their families and to the veterans 
who returned home, let us honor our 
fallen heroes by never taking for grant-
ed the freedoms for which they died. 
Let us also remember that our political 
differences must never make us en-
emies, and let us search together in 
good faith to protect this Nation we all 
love.

coronavirus is detected in the city of 
Wuhan. Little is known about the 
pathogen, aside from the fact that it is 
highly 
contagious 
and 
magnitudes 
more lethal than the flu. In just 3 
months—3 months—that virus causes a 
global pandemic, the likes of which 
none of us has seen in our lifetimes. It 
grinds the global economy to a halt. 
Stay-at-home orders become the new 
normal, and supply chains are dis-
rupted at nearly every stage in the pro-
duction process. 
Tragically, because of delay and de-
nial by the former administration, the 
United States experiences the world’s 
highest rates of COVID infections and 
deaths for all of 2020. Then comes a new 
year and a new administration. Today, 
thanks to the Biden administration’s 
competence and the scientific commu-
nity’s relentless pursuit of a vaccine, 
America is finally turning a corner in 
the fight against COVID–19. But the 
damage was deep, and our scars are 
still 
fresh. 
While 
the 
coronavirus 
raged, people lost their loved ones, and 
millions lost their livelihoods. 
Now, as we restart the engine of our 
economy, our Republican colleagues 
would have you believe that the reason 
America’s 
economy hasn’t bounced 
back fully is because American work-
ers are lazy; they would rather collect 
unemployment benefits than work. Re-
publicans would have you believe that 
the American people would rather 
binge-watch ‘‘The Office’’ than return 
to it. They must not know many Amer-
ican workers well—because Americans 
work longer and harder than workers 
in nearly every advanced economy. 
And for the workers who have been laid 
off over the past year, unemployment 
assistance has been lifesaving. 
Here is what enhanced unemploy-
ment benefits have meant for my con-
stituents in Illinois. One Chicago resi-
dent reached out to my office, saying 
that ‘‘my sister has been out of work 
since the pandemic hit Chicago . . . her 
husband works a full-time job during 
the day five days a week and cleans of-
fices three to four nights a week just to 
make ends meet . . . unemployment as-
sistance is essential.’’ 
That constituent wrote to me out of 
concern for her family, not herself—her 
sister, her brother-in-law, and her 
nieces and nephews. Tell me, does that 
father—working a full-time day job and 
cleaning offices at night—sound lazy to 
you? Does that family sound like they 
are coasting through this pandemic on 
Easy Street? Not to me, they don’t. 
Another constituent wrote to me out 
of concern for his wife. Because of the 
pandemic, she was laid off from the job 
she had for 20 years. He wrote, ‘‘She is 
actively looking for work but so far 
there are hardly any openings in her 
field.’’ 
That sentiment was echoed by an-
other constituent, who wrote, ‘‘My 35 
years of experience and outdated mas-
ter’s degree in marketing mean noth-
ing in this job market.’’ 
I also heard from a single mother of 
three who lost her job as a banquet 
server due to the pandemic. She has 
emptied her savings and is 3 months 
behind on mortgage payments. She 
worries that at 58 years old, it will be 
difficult to find new work. 
And one more story, my office re-
ceived a letter from a 63-year-old 
woman living with an autoimmune dis-
ease. She thought the job she had be-
fore COVID–19 would be her last job 
ever. But then she got laid off. Now, 
she relies on SNAP benefits to put food 
on the table and on Medicaid for the 
doctors and medicines she needs to 
control her disease. She wrote, ‘‘What 
a horrible thing to rely on the govern-
ment, but we have no choice.’’ Let me 
say that again: ‘‘We have no choice.’’ 
Do these sound like calculating con 
artists or loafs trying to scam Uncle 
Sam for a quick buck? These are Amer-
icans, our neighbors, and they are bare-
ly making their way through an un-
precedented public health crisis. And 
they made it because of unemployment 
assistance. And jobless benefits don’t 
just help the workers and families who 
receive them. They help communities. 
They keep money circulating during 
hard times. People are spending their 
enhanced unemployment benefits on 
groceries, rent, mortgage, and other 
necessities. 
Now, as we begin to recover, let’s not 
bash the workers who have borne the 
brunt of this pandemic. Let’s focus on 
what is actually holding our economy 
back. Let’s look at the facts. On Thurs-
day, the Department of Labor pub-
lished a report showing that new 
claims for unemployment insurance 
have fallen to their lowest level since 
the pandemic began. As more and more 
people get vaccinated, as we start 
bringing this virus under control and 
the world starts opening up, it is clear 
that Americans want to get back to 
work. They want to earn a living. So 
what is preventing more Americans 
from returning to the workforce? 
For one, people are still concerned 
about safety. It was only 2 weeks ago— 
May 13, to be exact—when the CDC an-
nounced that it is now safe for fully 
vaccinated people to take off their 
masks and resume activities that they 
had put on hold—May 13. The jobs re-
port that our Republican colleagues 
have been so eager to cite as proof that 
unemployment benefits are keeping 
people from working was based on data 
from early April. Remember what was 
happening in April? Lethal new COVID 
variants were tearing through the U.K., 
India, and other nations, and they were 
starting to show up in this Nation, too. 
Scientists weren’t yet sure whether the 
COVID vaccines would protect against 
the new variants. Thankfully, we now 
have an answer. But back in April, is it 
any wonder that some workers might 
have been uncertain about returning to 
work under those conditions? 
And then there are the continued 
challenges facing caregivers in Amer-
ica. 
Many parents—especially mothers— 
of young children still can’t return to 
work because so many schools and 
childcare programs remain closed. You 
can’t leave little kids home alone. 
Harry Truman used to say that what 
he really needed was a one-handed 
economist because all of the econo-
mists he knew told him, ‘‘On one hand, 
this . . . and on the other hand, that.’’ 
A new report coauthored by an econo-
mist who formerly worked in the 
Obama administration questions to 
what extent the lack of childcare is 
preventing parents from returning to 
the workforce. I expect to hear a lot 
about this report from our Republican 
colleagues. 
So I would point out that Mr. 
Furman and scores of other economists 
continue to warn that our failure to in-
vest 
in 
high-quality, 
affordable 
childcare 
will 
undoubtedly 
impede 
America’s future economic growth and 
global competitiveness. There is no 
‘‘other hand’’ about that. If we want to 
cultivate the world’s most educated, 
skilled workforce—a goal I am sure we 
all share—we need to ensure our chil-
dren are cared for—because cultivating 
that workforce begins before kinder-
garten. Yet the United States is the 
only advanced economy in the world 
that doesn’t guarantee parental leave 
for working parents. 
And we are one of the only advanced 
economies that doesn’t provide some 
form of universal early childhood edu-
cation. If you want to have a child in 
America, guess what? You are on your 
own. This is a structural problem in 
our economy that has existed for dec-
ades. The pandemic just brought it into 
sharp relief. 
The pandemic has also highlighted 
another structural problem for our 
economy. While last month saw big job 
growth in the leisure and hospitality 
industries, as restaurants, bakeries, 
and coffee shops started opening back 
up, those gains are just one part of the 
story. Jobs in manufacturing declined. 
Supply chain disruptions may account 
for some of these losses. 
But there is a bigger problem. Em-
ployers in high-skilled manufacturing 
companies have had difficulty for years 
filling positions. As a nation, we sim-
ply are not doing enough to train 
American workers for the manufac-
turing jobs of the 21st century, jobs 
like assembling electric car batteries 
or wind turbines. Workers who want to 
make a career change and learn these 
skills often have to take on thousands, 
even tens of thousands of dollars in 
student debt. We treat worker training 
as a personal problem rather than a 
collective good from which we all ben-
efit. 
As I said, America’s childcare crisis 
and a shortage of high-skilled workers 
existed long before COVID. Enhanced 
unemployment benefits have been an 
economic lifeline for millions of Amer-
icans families during this pandemic. 
Severing that lifeline prematurely 
won’t solve the long-term structural 
challenges facing our economy. It will 
only make things harder for already 
struggling families.

But we can address the challenge of 
childcare and take steps to help work-
ers develop new skills. In fact, Presi-
dent Biden and Senate Democrats have 
a plan to do it. It starts by investing in 
our children. 
With the American Families Plan, we 
can make childcare more accessible 
and affordable, like nearly every other 
advanced economy in the world. 
With the American Jobs Plan, we can 
invest in workers. It would direct bil-
lions of dollars toward helping dis-
located workers develop new skills and 
secure stable, well-paid jobs building 
wind turbines or electric vehicles or 
making other American-made goods 
that will be in high demand for years 
to come. The American Jobs Plan and 
the American Family Plan are blue-
prints for building a sustainable, pros-
perous economy that will create good 
jobs for decades to come. I commend 
President Biden for meeting with my 
Republican colleague in hopes of mov-
ing the country forward and urge Re-
publicans to work with Democrats to 
achieve these shared goals instead of 
rejecting our proposal immediately. 
We can remain the strongest, most 
dynamic economy in the world and 
make the 21st century another Amer-
ican century, but we have precious lit-
tle time and a lot of competition. We 
can’t waste that time wagging our fin-
gers at Americans who are struggling 
or ignoring the structural challenges 
that have existed for decades and have 
only gotten worse during the pan-
demic. 
The American Rescue Plan saved our 
economy. Now, let’s build it back bet-
ter than ever before with the American 
Jobs Plan and the American Families 
Plan. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
NOMINATION OF ERIC S. LANDER 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, today, 
the Senate should confirm a visionary 
scientist and thinker and one who will 
serve with distinction as Director of 
the Science and Technology Policy. 
Dr. Eric Lander represents the kind 
of new American pioneer, one com-
mitted to exploring horizons defined 
not by the boundaries of land and shore 
but of genes and genius, a pioneer who 
sees unanswered questions not as bar-
riers but as an expanse of possibility. 
He exemplifies what it means to rep-
resent a place where scientific progress 
is a part of our DNA. 
Eric’s breadth of knowledge, unparal-
leled experience, and innovative spirit 
make him uniquely suited to lead. 
With Dr. Lander at the head of the Of-
fice of Science and Technology Policy, 
all Americans will be his students, 
sharing his passion for science, dis-
covery, and achievement. 
Dr. Lander started his career as a 
mathematician. He has taught econom-
ics and has been one of the world’s 
foremost biomedical scientists for dec-
ades. 
When I was a young boy who refused 
to do his homework, my mother would 
threaten that she would donate my 
brain to Harvard as a completely un-
used human organ. Somehow, she an-
ticipated Dr. Lander and his work on 
the Human Genome Project and found-
ing of the Broad Institute of MIT and 
Harvard, which reflect his deep under-
standing of how science and policy can 
inform one another. 
At the Broad Institute, he pursued 
collaborative 
science, 
bringing 
to-
gether biologists, clinicians, chemists, 
engineers, 
and 
computational 
sci-
entists. The transformative model for 
scientific research that the Broad In-
stitute represents is a new way to take 
on the challenge that we face today, 
bringing scientific discoveries and ad-
vances forward more quickly than ever 
before. 
His contribution to science has also 
demonstrated how impactful research 
can be. The Human Genome Project 
was a 13-year-long project that in-
volved hundreds of scientists across the 
entire world. This project is an incred-
ible example of a publicly funded 
project that keeps knowledge in the 
public domain and a feat that provided 
a model for the kind of large-scale, co-
operative effort that the world’s big-
gest problems require. 
The Human Genome Project has also 
had an enormous economic impact, 
with one analysis from 10 years ago es-
timating the $3 billion project has pro-
duced more than 330,000 jobs and nearly 
$800 billion in economic benefit. 
Sequencing nearly the entire human 
genome has already led to countless 
advances, a trend that is certain to 
continue into the future. The project 
discovered genes that are fundamental 
to thousands of diseases—including 
heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and can-
cer—and paved the way for novel treat-
ments. 
In addition to his groundbreaking re-
search, he has taught MIT’s introduc-
tory biology course for more than 25 
years and is one of MIT’s most beloved 
teachers. He has inspired students to 
grapple with complex issues, helping 
them become informed and active 
members of their communities. He has 
an ability to explain the science of why 
much better than Senators can explain 
the political science of why not. That 
ability to teach and to translate is 
more important than ever before. 
I know Dr. Lander has the skill to re-
build the celebration of science that is 
the hallmark of American excellence. 
When his country needed him during 
the coronavirus pandemic, he moved to 
build from scratch to operation the 
largest noncommercial COVID testing 
laboratory in the country. 
He has been a strong supporter of 
people of color in science and improv-
ing racial equity in science outcomes. 
He has used science as a tool for jus-
tice, playing a key role in the origins 
of the Innocence Project, as his com-
mitment to justice and forensic science 
has spanned more than three decades. 
The crises we face today of human 
and mind and the intersection of those 
two forces are daunting. We are con-
fronted by a surging China and its race 
to dominate the scientific and techno-
logical landscape. That is why we must 
confirm Dr. Lander without delay, so 
he can get to work on behalf of the 
American people. 
We have a chance tonight to give our 
country a leader in science and tech-
nology, which we need at this critical 
time. 
I urge all Members to give him your 
support on the floor this evening. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 1260 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, as we 
emerge from the coronavirus pan-
demic, we have a real opportunity to 
revitalize American manufacturing and 
harness American leadership in sci-
entific and technological advancement. 
Today I urge my colleagues to support 
critical, bipartisan legislation that will 
do just that. 
The United States Innovation and 
Competition Act will help keep our 
country on the cutting edge of tech-
nology, strengthen American competi-
tiveness on a global stage, and protect 
our national security. 
International competitors like the 
Chinese Government are aggressively 
investing in manufacturing, science, 
and technology in an attempt to gain a 
competitive advantage over the United 
States, and we cannot let that happen. 
In order to maintain our edge, we must 
make serious investments in domestic 
research and development, technology, 
and manufacturing. 
We know that a strong manufac-
turing sector is the backbone of any 
economy. I have long believed that you 
cannot be a great country if you don’t 
make things. This bill contains a num-
ber of provisions to help revitalize and 
strengthen American manufacturing. 
A provision in this bill that Senator 
STABENOW and I led will provide $2 bil-
lion in new funding for the domestic 
production of mature semiconductor 
technologies that are absolutely crit-
ical to the automotive industry and 
other manufacturers all across our 
country. This provision is essential be-
cause our reliance on overseas semi-
conductor manufacturing is a threat to 
our economy and to our national secu-
rity. 
We are currently experiencing a 
semiconductor shortage that is causing 
massive supply chain disruptions and 
has idled plants in Michigan and other 
States across our country, forcing auto 
manufacturers to shut down factories 
and lay off workers. This is a com-
pletely unacceptable situation, and we 
must immediately work to address this 
challenge.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3857 
May 27, 2021 
Boosting manufacturing in Michigan 
and across the Nation requires a com-
prehensive Federal strategy to help 
companies grow our domestic manufac-
turing base. That is why I authored a 
provision in this legislation to reac-
tivate 
the 
Manufacturing 
Advisory 
Council and worked to increase funding 
for the Manufacturing Extension Part-
nership program, a program that helps 
small- and medium-sized manufactur-
ers grow their companies and create 
jobs. Together, these policies will help 
strengthen our manufacturing sector, 
advance our economic competitiveness, 
and create good-paying jobs. 
The United States Innovation and 
Competition Act also helps ensure that 
when we are spending American tax-
payer dollars, we are investing in 
American manufacturers and creating 
American jobs. 
As chairman of the Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs Com-
mittee, I was proud of our committee’s 
efforts to include several bipartisan 
provisions in this package that will 
strengthen ‘‘Buy American’’ require-
ments. These provisions, including one 
based on a bill Senator STABENOW and 
I introduced, will ensure that Amer-
ican taxpayer dollars are being used to 
buy American-made products and close 
loopholes that have allowed the use of 
Chinese- and Russian-made steel rather 
than using U.S. steel. Growing good- 
paying jobs in America must always be 
our focus, and passing this bill will do 
just that. 
This package also includes a provi-
sion to secure our supply chain and ad-
dress the serious national security 
risks posed by our overreliance on com-
panies in China and other countries for 
medical supplies. 
During the pandemic, we saw first-
hand how our country’s overreliance on 
foreign manufacturers for critical sup-
plies, 
such 
as 
personal 
protective 
equipment, left us unprepared to com-
bat the pandemic and cost American 
lives. 
This bill takes important steps to ad-
dress that, thanks to a provision I 
worked on with Senator PORTMAN to 
encourage investments that will ex-
pand domestic production of personal 
protective 
equipment 
here 
in 
the 
United States. 
These provisions and so many more 
will help us unleash American innova-
tion, lock in our competitive advan-
tage, and grow our economy, but that 
alone is not enough. We must also pro-
tect our advantage. That is why our 
committee worked to include critical 
provisions 
in 
this 
legislation 
to 
strengthen cyber security and protect 
against increasingly sophisticated ef-
forts by adversarial governments and 
criminal organizations to steal our re-
search and intellectual property. 
Cyber attacks pose a significant 
threat to our national security, and 
cyber attacks have significant real- 
world consequences. We saw this with 
the recent Colonial Pipeline attack. 
This bill includes provisions I authored 
to strengthen the Federal Govern-
ment’s capabilities to prevent and re-
spond to a significant cyber incident, 
creates a fund that can help entities re-
cover 
from 
serious 
breaches, 
and 
strengthens our Federal cyber work-
force, therefore ensuring our workers 
have the skills and knowledge to build 
a competitive advantage and secure 
our networks from these attacks. 
From spurring advancements in arti-
ficial intelligence to securing tax-
payer-funded research and intellectual 
property from adversaries who try to 
steal it, this legislation takes signifi-
cant steps to help ensure American 
companies and workers will continue 
to lead the way in developing the tech-
nologies and economy of the future. 
The process we followed to write this 
legislation shows that when we work 
together in a bipartisan manner, we 
can tackle the biggest challenges fac-
ing our Nation. I am grateful to my 
colleagues for all of their hard work, 
and I look forward to continuing to 
partner with our House counterparts to 
get these important provisions signed 
into law. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

TRIBUTE TO MICHELLE BLACKWELL 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we 
are in a bit of a lull here, so whenever 
there is a lull in Senate activity, it is 
one of those moments and times when 
you think about those who have con-
tributed to those of us who serve here 
in the Senate—staff who have been 
with us over a period of time, whether 
they be here in Washington, DC, or 
back in our home States. 
Tonight, I come to the floor to share 
some long overdue recognition to a 
long-term 
member 
of 
my 
team, 
Michelle Blackwell. 
We have had kind of a hectic begin-
ning to this Congress. Yet we are back, 
doing legislative business, and that is 
good, but it has, I guess, delayed my 
tribute to, again, an extraordinary 
Alaskan, a woman who has been a good 
team member but also a friend of mine. 
Earlier this year, Michelle retired 
from my team after 17 years of serv-
ice—amazing years—to the U.S. Sen-
ate, as a member of my staff in Alaska, 
and to many of my constituents back 
home. Since 2003, Michelle served as 
my regional representative for the 
Southcentral region on the Kenai Pe-
ninsula in Alaska. The Kenai Penin-
sula, for those who are not familiar 
with it, is a pretty significant area. It 
is equivalent in size to the States of 
Massachusetts and New Jersey com-
bined, with a population of about 55,000 
people. 
If there are roads that wind around 
and go up and down and into some 
pretty extraordinary areas, Michelle 
has traveled them, and she has rep-
resented this region with grace, effi-
ciency, 
diplomacy—resolving 
truly 
thousands of cases for constituents 
who have experienced problems with 
Federal Agencies. You name it—wheth-
er it is the IRS, whether it is Social Se-
curity, whether it is the VA—she has a 
story to tell there. Helping constitu-
ents and serving as a liaison to the 
community were really the keys to her 
success in my office. Her commitment 
to public service and to helping Alas-
kans has made me a better Senator and 
certainly a better representative for 
Alaskans. 
I have to confess that, as much as we 
would like to claim her 100 percent for 
Alaska, Michelle did not get her start 
in public service in the State of Alas-
ka. Like many who now call Alaska 
home, Michelle’s path was kind of an 
adventurous one as she worked her way 
north. 
She came to me from Wyoming via 
Washington, DC. She grew up in Wyo-
ming, and then, following college, she 
went to work for then-Congressman 
Dick Cheney. This was back in the 
early eighties. She started out on the 
front desk, as a good staffer does, and 
as 
many 
successful 
staffers 
like 
Michelle have done, she worked her 
way up from there. 
She spent 11 years working for Dick 
Cheney as one of his key aides, and he 
was so appreciative of her work that he 
brought her with him during his first 
tenure as Secretary of Defense under 
the 41st President, George H. W. Bush. 
As many of us know, when you find 
good staffers, you do everything that 
you can to hang on to them, but 
Michelle had a very adventurous spirit 
and a curiosity for foreign policy. She 
served a year in Switzerland with the 
State Department. She then returned 
to work for Mr. Cheney when his time 
with the first Bush administration had 
ended and he went to work for a public 
policy think tank, the American Enter-
prise Institute. Following this was the 
time that she then returned to Wyo-
ming and opened the next chapter of 
her life. 
In 1997, Michelle found herself in the 
famous Million Dollar Cowboy Bar in 
Jackson Hole, WY. I have been there 
myself—but Michelle met the man who 
would be her husband. The rest, as they 
say, is history. 
Michelle and Jack were married a 
year later, and their adventurous spirit 
continued. They moved north. They 
moved to Sitka, AK, where Jack would 
serve as the park ranger for the State 
of Alaska’s Department of Natural Re-
sources. They spent 4 years there in 
Sitka, and Michelle was very active in 
the community, not surprisingly. She 
served as the director of the local vis-
itor and tourism bureau—a key indus-
try to our State and certainly to that 
region. 
In 2002, Jack was transferred to 
Kenai, AK, to serve as the district 
ranger for Alaska State Parks for the

region. That is when Michelle found 
her way to the Alaska congressional 
delegation, where we found her. Again, 
I wish that I could take the credit for 
finding Michelle, but she came to work 
for the entire Alaska congressional del-
egation. This was at the time when the 
late Senator Ted Stevens was our sen-
ior Senator, and this was just when I 
was beginning my time in this office. 
Back then, the rules of this Chamber 
allowed us to share district offices and 
staff, so Michelle served not just me 
but also Senator Stevens and Congress-
man YOUNG, who, as we know, is now 
the dean of the House, so some pretty 
big political powerhouses between DON 
YOUNG and Senator Stevens. They are 
personalities that we have described as 
being larger than life at times and 
some personalities that can be inter-
esting to balance, but Michelle did so 
with patience and poise. 
All in all, Michelle has 25 years of 
Federal public service, and I am proud 
to say that 17 of those years have been 
as a member of my staff. 
Of all of her many professional ac-
complishments, you will not hear her 
boast, but you will hear her colleagues 
speak with the highest respect for her 
ethics and her duty to public service. 
She is so humble but so, so respected 
by her staff both on the State side and 
among the policy team here in DC. 
I have had a lot of time to be in a car 
with Michelle as we have driven around 
the Kenai Peninsula. I have seen her 
interact with constituents who have 
serious, challenging, personal, deeply 
emotional issues, and how she is able 
to communicate with Alaskans on 
their level, on their issues, in a way 
that is respectful and understanding 
and compassionate is a gift that is ex-
traordinary. 
Outside of the office, one source of 
pride—probably the biggest source of 
pride for Michelle—is very clear: the 
devotion to her family. When asked by 
others who worked with her, the first 
thing that you would hear is of 
Michelle’s dedication to her family, 
and she has a great family. 
Her husband, Jack, as I mentioned, is 
a great guy—a pilot. She was a little 
worried when he decided that, instead 
of a family minivan, it was going to be 
a family—I don’t remember whether it 
was a Cherokee or a Piper or a 175, but 
the family is flying around and doing a 
lot of Alaska that we all enjoy. 
They have two great kids, Jackson 
and Cameron. I have had the pleasure 
and the privilege to watch both of 
these young people grow into talented, 
kind, and smart young adults who are 
now pursuing college and postgraduate 
degrees. Jackson, who was a page here 
in the U.S. Senate and an intern for 
me, is a Truman Scholar. Cameron, his 
younger sister, was also a page here. 
She 
is 
pursuing 
a 
premed-health

a doctor. Jackson is working on Arctic 
issues and climate issues. You just 
couldn’t be prouder of these two young 
people. I know that Michelle is, and I 
certainly am. It has been great to be 
able to watch and be a part of their 
family. 
To the family—to Jack, to Jackson, 
and to Cameron—thank you for sharing 
your mom with me, with all of my 
staff, and really with the Senate and 
our country for so many years. We 
know that those years were nights and 
weekends and holidays when we took a 
lot of her time, and we appreciate that. 
I recognize that, as we see good, 
strong, capable, really impactful peo-
ple move on from our teams, it is just 
the closing of one chapter and the 
opening of yet another for Michelle and 
her family. 
So, to Michelle, thank you for all of 
the years that you have given to your 
public service and as a member of my 
staff. I wish you all the best in your 
very well-deserved retirement. 
TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL MATTHEW T. BELL, JR. 
Mr. President, as I am still on the 
floor and we are still in a pause, I want 
to provide some short remarks with re-
gard to an individual who has been not 
only a leader in the Alaska community 
for a period of years but a real leader 
for our U.S. Coast Guard. 
I rise to offer my commendation to 
ADM Matthew T. Bell, Jr., who served 
the Coast Guard for 36 years, most re-
cently as the commander of District 17, 
D17. 
He had his retirement ceremony just 
about 6 weeks or so ago, and I had the 
opportunity to be out there at his re-
tirement ceremony. It was held in Ju-
neau. We had the Commandant of the 
Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz, who led 
the delegation, join Senator SULLIVAN, 
myself, and Governor Dunleavy. It was 
pretty significant that you would have 
a gathering there in Juneau for this re-
tirement ceremony but not unusual be-
cause Admiral Bell had led in a way 
and manner that deserved this public 
recognition, certainly, at the highest 
level. 
D17 is an enormous region that cov-
ers the entirety of Alaska, from the 
Bering Strait to the Aleutian Chain 
and all of the surrounding waters. 
Admiral Bell, during his time there 
as head of D17, led with distinction, but 
before this he had had some pretty sig-
nificant and impressive roles. He com-
manded the Personnel Service Center. 
He served as chief of staff for the U.S. 
Coast Guard Pacific Area and as a 
chemistry and nautical science instruc-
tor at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. 
He served as commander of Task 
Group 55.6 in Bahrain in support of Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom, and he earned 
the highly esteemed ‘‘Cutterman’’ des-
ignation after more than 12 years of 
sea service. 
Three times—three times—he was 
the commanding officer and his com-
mands included the Coast Guard Cutter 
Point Divide, Coast Guard Cutter Alex 
Haley, and Coast Guard Cutter Douglas 
Munro. 
The Alex Haley and Munro were each 
stationed in Kodiak when Admiral Bell 
served as their commander. In fact, we 
had the retirement ceremony for Admi-
ral Bell, and then the following day we 
flew out to Kodiak to attend the de-
commissioning of the Munro after 40 
years of service—pretty admirable run. 
But I can imagine that these tours 
helped sow the seeds of home for Admi-
ral Bell and his family. 
So I mentioned I had the opportunity 
to be there when Admiral Bell passed 
on the roles and responsibility of the 
D17 command. It was April 21. 
He was honorably awarded and recog-
nized for his outstanding service and 
retirement. But, again, I think it is 
noteworthy. This was not your average 
retirement ceremony. We had COVID– 
19 protocols that were still in place. 
Senator SULLIVAN and I were in the 
front row. It was a pretty limited gath-
ering. I think they were limited to 30 
people, joined by the Governor of Alas-
ka. Over 300 people watched by live 
feed, but behind us—so in the speaker’s 
view and behind us—was this excep-
tionally distracting view, the beauty of 
Mendenhall Glacier that was behind us. 
And every one of the speakers noted 
that it was quite extraordinary to be in 
this setting. 
But I was honored to be invited and 
humbled to represent the Alaskans who 
have all deeply appreciated the Coast 
Guard’s work in our State, and espe-
cially while Admiral Bell was at the 
helm. 
I want to take just note of the fact 
and thank Admiral Bell and all of the 
really invaluable, heroic work that D17 
does in the State. 
In a given month in the State of 
Alaska, D17 rescues 22 souls, assists 53 
people, saves over $1.65 million in prop-
erty across 3,853,500 square miles and 
over 47,300 miles of shoreline—a lot of 
space, lot of territory to cover. 
Alaska is tough. It is rugged. It is 
big. But these missions are carried out 
in the toughest, most challenging envi-
ronment. And as I heard Admiral Bell 
mention during his retirement cere-
mony, he said: ‘‘If you can do the Coast 
Guard’s mission in Alaska, you can do 
the job anywhere [else].’’ 
And he is right. It is the best that we 
will see. 
Not only are Coast Guard men and 
women in Alaska mastering their craft 
and saving lives and property, they are 
also integral members of our commu-
nities. Those members and their fami-
lies are our neighbors. They are our 
classmates. They are our friends. And I 
deeply appreciate the connection and 
fond relationship shared by the Coast 
Guard and Alaska, and that is why it is 
so important, I think, to just take the 
time to honor and to thank incredible 
leaders like Admiral Bell. 
So on behalf of Alaska, I thank you 
for everything you have done to con-
tinue the longstanding legacy of life-
saving, environmental protection, and 
maritime safety in our great State. 
But beyond that, thank you for rep-
resenting and nurturing the connec-
tions between the Coast Guard and our 
State as the D17 commander and neigh-
bor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3859 
May 27, 2021 
And I want to end my comments to-
night with just a comment about Matt 
Bell as the neighbor. Matt and his wife 
Nancy have raised three sons, and like 
most Coast Guard families, they moved 
numerous times. They have accepted 
the assignments and adventure with 
the kind of a matter-of-factness that 
comes with military service. But wher-
ever they have been stationed, they 
have become part of the community. 
They have made that community just a 
little bit better. 
And when Matt and Nancy came to 
Alaska, they knew they were home. 
They said it. Absolutely, they knew 
they were home. In fact, it was some-
what interesting. Nancy was not at the 
retirement ceremony there in Juno be-
cause she had already moved all of 
their household goods to Kodiak. I 
think it was her first week of work 
there. She was working at the Coast 
Guard base there. So, you know, she is 
a true Coast Guard family for life. 
But for a small little side note and an 
anecdote, at the conclusion of the de-
commissioning of the Munro, I had to 
fly back to Anchorage, and as it turned 
out, the same airplane that was going 
to be taking me back to Anchorage 
from Kodiak was the same airplane 
that was delivering just recently re-
tired Admiral Bell to Kodiak to come 
home to his wife and help, basically, 
move in. 
Long story short, weather comes in 
and there are no airplanes to Kodiak. 
So he is not coming in and I am not 
going out. 
As it was, I was supposed to be in An-
chorage at a family dinner, and I knew 
that they had a place set for me, and 
while I was at the airport trying to re-
arrange reservations and trying to find 
accommodations 
for 
the 
evening, 
Nancy Bell was at the airport waiting 
for her husband. And she said: What 
can I do to make sure that you have a 
place to stay? 
And I said: Well, it’s not just about 
me. I have a whole volleyball team 
from Palmer and a soccer team from 
the valley. What are we going to do 
with 50-some-odd kids when there is no 
airplane until tomorrow? 
And Nancy Bell sprung into action, 
as a good community member, to see 
what it was that she could do to get 
not only me and a couple of staff peo-
ple but to get a couple teams of kids 
situated for the evening. 
And I said: You know, Nancy, you are 
taking care of me. Matt needs to go to 
my family dinner in Anchorage and 
take my place. 
And so he did. He had a great evening 
with my family, and I had a great op-
portunity to spend a little bit more 
time with his wife in Kodiak. 
But it just speaks to the neighbor-
liness that goes on. You have a signifi-
cant leader in our U.S. Coast Guard—a 
man who he and his family have given 
so much, 36 years in service. And they 
are now going to give that to their 
community—their 
Alaska 
commu-
nity—that they have adopted, and we 
have embraced them. 
We honor them, and we wish the best 
for them and their family in their re-
tirement. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNIONS 
Mr. BROWN. The Presiding Officer 
and I and another 20 or so Senators lis-
tened yesterday in the Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs Committee to 
the CEOs of the Nation’s six largest 
banks testify to our committee. Those 
six CEOs are among—or maybe the six 
most—powerful 
business 
people 
in 
America. 
I look to what has happened to my 
hometown of Mansfield, OH, and to 
Zanesville, OH, and Lima and Chil-
licothe and Portsmouth and Spring-
field—medium-size 
industrial 
cities 
that 40 years ago were prosperous in-
dustrial communities that created and 
which were the homes of thousands— 
tens of thousands, really, of good-pay-
ing union jobs, allowing people out of 
high school to go into the plant and 
make a decent middle-class living, al-
lowing them to send their kids to 
North Central State or Mansfield OSU 
or Denison or schools all over Ohio. 
But in the last 30 or 40 years, we have 
seen what Wall Street has done. Wall 
Street has done just fine for them-
selves. We have seen profits go up dra-
matically. We have seen executive 
compensation 
stratospheric—tens 
of 
millions of dollars for most of these 
CEOs and their earnings every year and 
their compensation. 
But we see middle-class wages in 
places like Toledo and Akron simply 
flat. And we heard a lot at that hearing 
yesterday, from these CEOs, about how 
much they value their employees. Yet 
not one of these CEOs agreed to remain 
neutral 
if 
their 
workers 
want 
to 
unionize. 
And I know from my State, whether 
it is Dayton or whether it is Trotwood 
or whether it is Zanesville—I know 
from my State—that when workers are 
lucky enough to carry a union card, 
they are much more likely to prosper. 
These CEOs said: Yeah, we want our 
employees’ voices to be heard. 
But that is not what remaining neu-
tral means—not using their vast power 
to intimidate their employees. 
The Presiding Officer has seen it in 
Georgia, we saw it recently in Ala-
bama, and I have seen it many times in 
Ohio, where an employer uses the vast 
resources of the corporation to brow-
beat—or however they do it—to stop 
people from voting for the union that 
would make their lives better. 
I heard these CEOs say they are fo-
cused on lending to small businesses 
and growing the economy, but I don’t 
see that in Newark. I don’t see that in 
Canton. I don’t see it in Warren or 
Youngstown. These small businesses 
want help. 
The community bankers did it. For 
community 
bankers, 
their 
lending 
went up during the pandemic, but these 
large six banks restricted their lending 
in the pandemic. 
But they had enough money left to 
do major stock buybacks. One of these 
companies planned to do $25 billion. It 
was announced just recently that one 
of these six banks was going to do a $25 
billion stock buyback. 
Do you know who that enriches? It 
certainly doesn’t enrich the commu-
nity. It doesn’t enrich Columbus or 
Cincinnati or Blue Ash or Bellaire or 
Steubenville. What it does is enrich the 
executives. These six CEOs said that, 
yes, climate change is a threat to the 
entire economy, but they drag their 
feet when it comes to investing in new 
technology and jobs for the future. 
I am glad they raised wages, a num-
ber of them—and I know the Presiding 
Officer from Georgia saw this. Right 
before the hearing, one of the compa-
nies agreed to raise the minimum wage 
of its employees significantly. A couple 
others of them bragged about their di-
versity in their workplace. They had 
just put the first Black woman on their 
board. 
But we also know that one of those 
CEOs—this is not even quite believable, 
but I can prove it with the math, as we 
did during the hearing. One of these 
CEOs makes 900 times what the lowest, 
what some of their new employees 
make—900 times. I don’t think they 
claim to work 900 times harder. But 
how do you figure this out? How does 
this come about, that a CEO will make 
900 times what some of its workers 
make? 
I am glad they raised wages. I am 
glad they made some investments in 
minority depository institutions. And I 
was even welcome to hear them brag 
about their investments in Howard and 
Fisk and one of the great institutions 
in the Presiding Officer’s home State, 
in Atlanta, with Morehouse. I am glad 
they are doing that. I am glad they are 
increasing diversity in their senior 
leadership. I hope they continue it, and 
we will be watching. 
It is not close to enough, though, 
when these are the most powerful ac-
tors in this country. The signals that 
these companies send to influence 
workers and companies all over the 
country—it is not just the thousands of 
employees. It is important to remem-
ber, when financial services makes 
about 25 percent of the profits of all 
corporations in the country—financial 
services accounts for about 25 percent 
of it, but they are only 4 percent of all 
the employees. Four percent of all the 
employees in the country work for fi-
nancial services, but they account for 
25 percent of the profit. That tells a 
story too. It tells the story that these 
large banks have built an economy 
that is good for them. They built an

economy that is good for financial 
services. They built an economy that is 
good for the largest banks—not the 
community banks in Savannah or La-
grange or Griffin, GA, or Mansfield or 
Shelby or Crestline, OH, but they have 
built an economy that is good for the 
big guys. 
Let me give you a couple examples. 
Before the pandemic, Bank of America 
downgraded Chipotle’s stock because 
an analyst decided the company pays 
its workers too much. They down-
graded the stock because an analyst 
said it pays the workers too much. As 
a result, the company’s share price de-
clined. 
When American Airlines announced 
pay raises for its pilots and flight at-
tendants, Wall Street punished the 
company, dropping its stock price by 5 
percent. So when American Airlines 
does the right thing—they decide to in-
vest more money in their workers— 
Wall Street slaps them and says: Don’t 
do that. That doesn’t help the econ-
omy. 
A Citibank analyst actually wrote— 
believe this: 
This is frustrating. Labor is being paid 
first again. Shareholders get leftovers. 
Leftovers? 
Shareholders 
get 
left-
overs? 
We might have thought that after 
the pandemic things might start to 
change a little bit. No one could deny 
how 
much 
essential 
workers 
con-
tribute—the bus driver in Cleveland, 
the drugstore worker in Lima, the 
nurse in Bellaire. Those are the people 
who really were the heroes in this 
economy. Our economy is supposed to 
reward people whose talents are in high 
demand. That is what we are taught. 
That is what corporate leaders tell us, 
right? 
But this year, after Amazon defeated 
Alabama’s workers’ union organization 
effort, the company stock climbed. 
Just a few weeks ago, Wall Street sent 
Uber and Lyft and DoorDash stocks 
down when Labor Secretary Walsh said 
gig workers should be classified as em-
ployees. 
So when the government decides we 
need to do something, we need to make 
sure these workers are treated better, 
Wall Street essentially attacks those 
companies’ stocks. Think about that. 
It sends a pretty clear message. The 
more you pay your employees, the 
worse you are going to do on Wall 
Street. The less power you give work-
ers, the better you will do. That view 
that American workers are costs to cut 
instead of a valuable asset to invest in, 
that is what is wrong with this system. 
So-called analysts at Wall Street, often 
at the banks—these six largest banks— 
make decisions for people in Ohio, 
Georgia and Pennsylvania and across 
the country. They make decisions 
about whether workers they have never 
met, in towns they have never been 
to—whether those workers are a good 
investment. 
I hope these banks make progress not 
only within their own institutions but 
thinking about the role these banks 
play in leading this system and leading 
our economy and leading this country. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
THE 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BROWN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, later on 
this evening, it is my hope that we will 
be moving forward on the U.S. Innova-
tion and Competition Act, which many 
of us are still calling the Endless Fron-
tier Act. I will be voting to support 
final passage. This landmark bill has 
prompted considerable debate. 
This legislation is about maintaining 
America’s edge in research and tech-
nology. That is a top priority for my 
party, and it is a top priority for the 
Democratic Party in this Chamber. 
And it ought to prompt a spirited dis-
cussion. And it has prompted such a 
discussion. How many bills has this 
been said about? 
The bill is not perfect. There are ele-
ments that I could do without, and 
there are parts that I wish were in-
cluded. But on the whole, this is a nec-
essary step to keep our Nation com-
petitive. This bill puts forth a bold vi-
sion for scientific research across mul-
tiple Federal Agencies and authorizes a 
historic down payment on the prior-
ities that can keep America at the 
forefront of innovation. This bill is a 
huge boost for American R&D. It au-
thorizes substantial R&D investments 
through the Department of Energy, the 
Department of Commerce, NASA, and, 
of course, the National Science Foun-
dation, which is the gold standard for 
basic research. 
In addition to a new NSF Direc-
torate, it will speed up the translation 
of R&D into practical applications and 
help tech innovators through the cre-
ation of technology hubs around the 
country and expanded manufacturing 
programs. 
Our adversaries are well aware that 
America leads the world in innovation. 
Instead of trying to outinnovate the 
United States, some of our adversaries 
are choosing to steal what we create. 
The Chinese Communist Party is, bar 
none, the world’s worst offender when 
it comes to research and intellectual 
property theft, making today’s legisla-
tion especially urgent. 
This legislation takes steps to im-
prove research security at the National 
Science Foundation. Although the in-
troduced bill did not contain adequate 
provisions in this area, I worked with 
Senator CANTWELL, the chair of the 
Commerce Committee, to craft a pack-
age of reforms to safeguard taxpayer- 
funded research and intellectual prop-
erty. 
Our approach will ensure that the re-
search community understands and 
complies with security policy and that 
grant applicants go through appro-
priate risk assessments. The research 
security title establishes a new re-
search security office at the NSF to 
centralize the process of developing 
these security requirements and assess-
ing potential risks. The office is em-
powered to pull in the intelligence and 
law enforcement Agencies to assist in 
targeted risk assessments. 
We also establish a clearing-house for 
the research community to share infor-
mation about security threats. Impor-
tantly, the research security title also 
includes a ban on Federal employees 
participating in foreign talent pro-
grams and a strict provision on tax- 
funded awards going to researchers 
who participate in talent programs run 
by our greatest adversaries. These ini-
tiatives and many others constitute a 
new and bold research security pro-
gram at the National Science Founda-
tion. 
This bill also represents a huge step 
forward for geographical diversity in 
R&D. Currently, half of all Federal 
R&D funds go to just six States and the 
District of Columbia. 
Closing that divide has been a pri-
ority of mine since my first days in the 
House of Representatives. Today’s leg-
islation will boost R&D at emerging in-
stitutions so that no region goes unuti-
lized in our efforts to compete with 
China. 
I regret that this bill was put 
through with a rushed process. Our ini-
tial markup in committee was sched-
uled just 1 day after the bill was 
dropped. That markup got postponed. 
Two weeks later, we had a day-long 
markup where we dealt with more than 
250 committee amendments. After in-
corporating over 100 of those amend-
ments, the bill passed by a vote of 24 to 
4. 
Let me repeat that. The bill passed 
the Commerce Committee by a vote of 
24 yeses and only 24 noes. 
A few days later, the bill reached the 
Senate floor, where more than 500 
amendments have been filed. Clearly, 
there is a desire to legislate in this 
body and on this legislation given suffi-
cient time and opportunity. 
This bill should put to rest—to rest— 
any discussion of changing the fili-
buster. The Senate is perfectly capable 
of functioning if the majority allows it 
to function. And it has done so this 
week and in the days last week when 
we were considering this legislation. 
I would add that it would be wrong 
and unnecessary for this bill to be 
funded through reconciliation. Passing 
this consensus legislation through a 
partisan process would send exactly 
the wrong message to our adversaries. 
And we are getting it done under reg-
ular order. It may not be pretty. It 
may not be the most efficient thing 
ever devised by the mind of man, but 
we are getting this done under current 
rules. Everyone has been heard, and it 
will be passed under regular order, I 
think with a very nice vote.

S3861 
May 27, 2021 
I wish to congratulate the two au-
thors of this legislation, Senator SCHU-
MER and Senator TODD YOUNG, for their 
success in this bill. I especially appre-
ciate Senator YOUNG’s commitment to 
improving our competitiveness and his 
leadership in moving this bill forward. 
I also want to thank the chair of the 
Commerce Committee, MARIA
CANT-
WELL, for helping shepherd this bill 
through the oftentimes challenging 
floor, for her patience and her skill in 
helping to lead us through the amend-
ment process. 
And, then, how could we end debate 
or approach the end of consideration of 
this legislation without thanking our 
staffs for the countless hours on both 
sides of the aisle, for the people who 
worked so hard on this bill and the 
amendments? The excellent, knowl-
edgeable way in which they have ap-
proached this legislation would be 
amazing to the American public if they 
could look into the process and see how 
hard these public servants work. 
I want to particularly thank the out-
standing contributions of my staff di-
rector, John Keast. But also he would 
want me to make a particular point of 
congratulating policy director James 
Mazol and my deputy policy director 
Cheri Pascoe—neither of whom has 
slept very much recently. They have 
done exceptional work. 
I know Senator CANTWELL feels the 
same about the great public servants 
on her staff, on her side of the aisle. 
They have done this at great personal 
sacrifice from their families and from 
themselves. And I know we are all well- 
served by our staffs, and I am most 
thankful for mine. 
But I am also thankful for the legis-
lative process, for the fact that on this 
issue, increasing secure R&D to combat 
our adversaries, particularly those in 
Communist China—I want to thank the 
Members of this Senate on both sides 
of the issue and on both sides of the 
aisle for the great way in which this 
Senate has conducted regular order. 
I will be voting yes. I think a sizable 
majority of the Senate will be voting 
yes. And we will be doing good by our 
constituents and by future generations 
in doing so. Thank you. 
And I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The Senator from Wash-
ington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
wanted to commend and thank the 
Senator from Mississippi for his hard 
work. I have the great pleasure of 
working with him on the Commerce 
Committee, and I can tell you we are 
here tonight—not at this very moment 
at 10 o’clock but at the advent of get-
ting to this moment where we can pro-
ceed to such important legislation— 
thanks to him and his great work as 
the ranking member on the Commerce 
Committee. 
I want to personally thank him for 
that because I think the Senator de-
scribed the actual process pretty well. 
We have two colleagues who have had a 
lot of foresight and thought about this 
issue—Senator SCHUMER, who for a 
long time has discussed America’s 
competitiveness and what we need to 
do about it, particularly as it relates to 
shifting change and demographics on a 
lot of foreign policy issues, and our col-
league from Indiana, who has also in 
the last 2 years put a lot of work into 
thinking about the future of AI com-
petitiveness, manufacturing, and what 
we need to do to be competitive in the 
United States of America. So the Schu-
mer-Young proposal is not new to this 
Congress. It was proposed before. And 
so this is work for many, many, many 
months. I do think, as Senator WICKER 
stated, that we should thank them for 
their foresight. 
I think, depending on what part of 
America you are from, you have a per-
spective about the economy of the fu-
ture and how we are going to compete. 
For me, I am very blessed to represent 
the State of Washington with much in-
novation and really longtime work to 
get to the point where we are today. 
One thing I would like to depart with 
is that we didn’t get to the Northwest 
economy overnight. A lot of thought 
went into the education system and 
the workforce training issues. Some-
times I just say we are blessed to have 
people there who stayed and innovated 
with the companies that they inno-
vated in. 
Where we are today represents dec-
ades and decades of work, but it also 
gives you a little bit of foresight into 
the importance of research and devel-
opment. The University of Washington 
is a leader in research and development 
with NSF and with predecessors here in 
the Senate who—Warren Magnuson 
specifically—focused on both NIH and 
NSF dollars. With the size of an insti-
tution with 40,000 students, it is also a 
premier research institution. 
So that has given us a good footing 
for the future, the work they have done 
and the advent of Microsoft and so 
many companies with executives who 
then also put more into the University 
of Washington so we could grow our 
skill set and keep investing. So it is a 
long-term investment. 
Our colleague from Indiana and our 
colleague from New York basically 
challenged us to think about what is 
our R&D investment for the United 
States of America and are we com-
peting. Senator WICKER
knows that 
this is something the Commerce Com-
mittee twice before had considered, in 
2007 and 2010. He said: By God, we are 
going to double the R&D budget, and 
we are going to compete. 
Believe it or not, it was George Bush 
as President who first authored a re-
port that said America needs to have a 
more aggressive competitiveness pol-
icy. He was probably looking to Asia 
and seeing what was happening and 
saying we needed to do more. 
The advent of that is, we started 
down the right road. We tried to make 
a commitment. We didn’t completely 
follow through because of the down-
turn in the economy. Instead of dou-
bling that R&D budget in a short pe-
riod of time—5 to 7 years, and then we 
thought 11 years—well, it has turned 
into 22 years, and we really haven’t 
quite done the job. 
To our two colleagues, I thank them. 
I thank the Senator from Indiana. I 
certainly thank the Senator from New 
York because I think that without his 
continued heft behind this issue, say-
ing that it is a priority—I told him he 
must have read Andy Grove’s book 
‘‘Only the Paranoid Survive’’ because 
he has clearly adopted that attitude as 
it relates to America’s competitiveness 
and making sure we make investments 
in the semiconductor area—an area he 
knows well. He really does believe it 
needs the R&D investment and focus. I 
applaud him because really, without 
his major push, I don’t think we would 
be here on the Senate floor tonight. 
As my colleague Senator WICKER 
said, this bill includes a massive in-
vestment in the NSF budget and in the 
DOE budget, which is kind of tandem. 
That is what has happened every time 
we have had this discussion. NSF and 
DOE, the Department of Energy and 
the National Science Foundation, have 
been our key tools for research and de-
velopment in key areas that keep man-
ufacturing competitive, keep our en-
ergy sector competitive, and keep our 
technology competitive. They have 
been major investments. 
The challenge that we faced is that 
we also were asking ourselves—besides 
trying to double our investment in 
these areas, we also said we want to 
get more out of the investment we 
have today. We want to basically get 
more out of the technology that we are 
creating and get it translated into 
more innovation right away. 
This legislation does that by creating 
a new Tech Director at the National 
Science Foundation to, if you will—we 
have basic research, applied research— 
to have translational or user research 
to more quickly aid in the adoption of 
technologies that will help our econ-
omy grow. That was a pretty big step 
in the legislation. 
Of course, Senator WICKER and I be-
lieve that investing in the workforce 
that we would need with STEM edu-
cation was also a priority. So there was 
a pretty big, hefty boost in science, 
technology, engineering, and math in 
this underlying bill, including saying 
that women and minorities in the 
sciences have to be a priority and we 
have to do more to encourage that. 
I want to thank Senator WICKER es-
pecially for his insistence on a key pro-
vision that I think is also important. 
Part of this is saying that we need to 
be competitive and increase the R&D 
budget. Part of it is saying that we 
need 
to 
have 
more 
translational 
science, get more out of our univer-
sities, and have them protect their in-
tellectual property better. But this is 
also about having all of America better 
prepared for the economy of the future 
and compete.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3862 
May 27, 2021 
Senator WICKER said: I want 20 per-
cent of this bill, the legislation—the 
R&D dollars to go to States that are 
called EPSCoR-qualifying States. They 
are regions of the country where we 
have 
identified 
that 
we 
need 
to 
strengthen our research capacity. So 
the 25 States that are qualified as 
EPSCoR States know, and it is a pro-
gram that has been built around 
strengthening their research and devel-
opment. Senator WICKER’s insistence 
on this provision will help those States 
grow their research muscle for the fu-
ture, 
their 
research 
ecosystem, 
strengthen 
their 
universities, 
and 
strengthen the dollars that go to them. 
I applaud him for that dedication. 
The head of the NSF, the National 
Science Foundation, will tell you that 
our motto for this bill overall or our 
goal as a nation is to be for innovation 
everywhere, connected to opportunities 
everywhere, connected to universities. 
With 
the 
provision 
that 
Senator 
WICKER proposed, we are literally tak-
ing another step towards building that 
infrastructure everywhere. If you are 
in Fairbanks, AK, or you are in Mis-
sissippi or some other part of the coun-
try, those institutions will get an extra 
focus and push to get more research 
and development. 
I like to say that you never know 
what is going to come out of that. You 
never know what is going to come out 
of one individual at one institution 
with a great idea that really charges 
forward in a new area. So I think it is 
a great provision of the legislation. 
We have, I think, with the other pro-
visions our colleagues worked on—Sen-
ator WARNER and Senator CORNYN—on 
trying to, in the last NDAA bill, make 
us crisply focused on the immense com-
petition that we face in the semicon-
ductor industry, we really have, I 
think, before us the shape of the debate 
about America’s competition. We are 
not afraid to put research dollars on 
the table as a country. Our Nation be-
lieves in that more than other nations. 
Our people believe that is what has 
made our Nation great, and they know 
that if we keep making that invest-
ment, we are going to grow jobs and 
the economy. So we have made that 
commitment in this legislation. 
We have made the commitment to di-
versify our research, to get more out of 
our research and translate that faster. 
We have made a commitment to skill 
and educate a workforce, not only with 
the diversity we like to see in science 
but the geographic diversity we like to 
see as well. 
We didn’t spend a lot of time talking 
about what is in here for the Depart-
ment of Energy. It is not specific as to 
what the Department of Energy will do 
for this, but it is safe to say the De-
partment of Energy’s innovation pro-
gram and ARPA-E are basically trying 
to help us with the next generation of 
energy technology. But it also includes 
carbon sequestration and a whole vari-
ety of other areas, nuclear power and a 
whole translation of various energy 
sciences. 
I really believe we will be working 
together. I believe DOE, NSF, our Na-
tional Laboratories, our universities— 
the collaboration that we heard about 
in committee will be the kind of 
growth that comes out of this legisla-
tive effort. 
To many Americans at home, all I 
can say is, we are making another in-
vestment in American know-how, the 
ability to use our scientific skills to 
help create the next generation of work 
and effort. 
I, too, want to thank our staff. I cer-
tainly on my side want to thank our 
staff director David Strickland and Me-
lissa Porter, Richard-Duane Chambers, 
Mary Guenther, and Stacy Baird. 
I, too, want to thank the Senator’s 
staff—John Keast, Cheri Pascoe, and 
James Mazol—because they have been 
a great team to work with. 
I also want to thank, on Senator 
SCHUMER’s staff—Mike Kuiken and Jon 
Cardinal—because they have been a 
constant source in all of this. 
Of course I thank all the floor team 
who have been out here working on 
this. I know there are other people 
from this room. 
I also thank Senator WICKER’s staff, 
Crystal Tully and Steven Wall. 
On my staff, I thank Jonathan Hale 
and David Marten and Amit Ronen, 
who worked on a lot of the energy stuff 
that was part of this underlying stuff. 
I am sure we will have more to thank 
later. This is a wish by Senator WICKER 
that this would be the wrap-up. I know 
we are not quite at the wrap-up, but we 
are hoping that we will hotline a man-
agers’ proposal. I hope our colleagues 
will look at that. I hope that our col-
leagues will allow us to move forward 
on that. If they are not going to let us 
move forward on that, I wish they 
would come down to the floor and tell 
us that. It is time to move forward on 
getting the rest of this legislation 
through the Senate and move to what-
ever discussions we are going to have 
with the House. 
It is safe to say this represents a lot 
of work by a lot of people. In the com-
mittee, I think we processed before we 
even got to the legislation something 
like 52 amendments prior to the actual 
day. With the substitute, I think we 
processed another 40 or 50 amendments. 
I think we had dozens of rollcall votes. 
That was all in committee. 
Out here, we processed lots of legisla-
tion to be part of the managers’ 
amendment. It is safe to say that prac-
tically every Member of the U.S. Sen-
ate has had some part or discussion or 
legislative suggestions that are a part 
of this bill. It is, as Senator WICKER 
said, a very regular order process, al-
beit quick at times. 
I think we have a lot to do. We have 
been very challenged as a Congress to 
deal with a lot of issues—COVID spe-
cifically—but the competition is not 
waiting and the competition has dif-
ferent tools. We have a different gov-
ernment and we believe in collabora-
tion, and collaboration, yes, takes a 
little more time. 
I think it is going to strengthen us in 
our ability to compete because we are 
going to be on the same page about 
what we need to get done. I hope our 
colleagues will indulge us to move 
ahead. I hope that we can get this next 
managers’ 
amendment 
and 
other 
things voted on very soon. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
have a package of amendments that 
have been agreed to by both leaders 
and by the chairs and ranking members 
of the relevant committees, so I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
amendments be agreed to en bloc: Col-
lins 1583, Fischer 1637, Johnson 1701,

ney 2103, Ossoff 2105, Barrasso 2094, 
Rubio 2106, and Kaine 2090. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, the sponsors 
and managers of this bill have made 
the point that this piece of legislation 
has followed regular order, and I will 
admit, versus how things have been 
passed in the last 10 years since I have 
been here, this is a little bit better reg-
ular order than I have experienced in 
general. But it still does not even come 
close to giving Members time to fully 
consider what we are voting on here. I 
don’t even have a total score on this. I 
have been told it is approaching a quar-
ter of a trillion dollars. 
The history of this bill is on May 13, 
about 730 pages were reported out of 
committee. This wasn’t exactly the bill 
that was voted out of committee, 
though. 
Somewhere, 
somehow, 
the 
chair modified at least one amendment 
that was not particularly recognizable 
to those that offered the amendment. 
On 5/19, on September—or May 19, the 
bill grew to 1,445 pages, and just today 
we voted on an amendment, 900 pages. 
So now here we are at 11 o’clock. We 
come to the Chamber. For the first 
time, I see what the amendments are in 
the managers’ package. 
I am sorry. I don’t know what these 
amendments are. I know what my 
amendment is. I don’t know what the 
rest of these are. I haven’t seen them. 
I don’t even know how many pages this 
is. I just have a list. So you can claim 
this is regular order. You can claim 
this is a deliberative process, but it is 
far from it. 
So I would just ask that the Senator 
modify her request; that the Senate 
stand in recess for 3 hours—only 3 
hours—to allow us to review this pack-
age of amendments. 
Would the Senator modify her re-
quest? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify her request? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
know my colleague knows the Com-
merce process, knows that we went 
through a very elaborate process in 
Commerce, and I know that he has 
amendments in this proposal. Some of 
these have been available since 11, 12 
hours ago. People have been talking 
about these amendments. So it is time 
for us to honor the request of our col-
leagues to move forward on a man-
agers’ package worked out by the lead-
ers and the relevant chair and ranking 
member, so I object to the modifica-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard on the modification. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I join my colleagues today to make a 
simple request: Let the people see the 
bill. 
Too often, this body acts without due 
time given to hear from all of the ones 
we represent: the American people. 
That has absolutely been the case this 
year as Congress has rushed through 
massive, 1,000- or 2,000-plus-page bills, 
spending billions or trillions of tax dol-
lars without valuable input. 
Now you ask us to vote on a massive 
bill compiled just this evening. That is 
wrong, and the American public know 
it is wrong. We haven’t had the time to 
read this. No one has, in fact. This en-
tire bill as it sits here before us has 
only been under consideration for a lit-
tle over 2 weeks, with thousands of 
pages, and it has been amended numer-
ous times, including many times today. 
It spends hundreds of billions of tax 
dollars. 
As my colleagues know well, I am as 
vocal an opponent of Communist China 
as anyone. America must take decisive 
action to protect our interests and 
combat the threats posed by China’s 
Communist regime. If the purpose of 
this legislation is to address that ur-
gent issue, it should do that with input 
and feedback from the public. 
We should table this vote, let the 
Members return to our States, hear 
from constituents, and then move for-
ward in a timely manner with the leg-
islation after we have heard from our 
constituents. This is a simple and rea-
sonable request. Therefore, I ask the 
Senator to modify her request to delay 
further consideration of S. 1260 until 
the week of June 7. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify her request? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, my 
colleague also knows the work of the 
Commerce Committee because he is on 
the Commerce Committee, and this bill 
came out of the Commerce Committee 
24 to 4. So I know the Senator knows 
the work of that legislation. 
The remarkable aspect of this legis-
lation is that it did compile product 
from various committees, and those 
committees did their regular order 
process. In fact, this process for the 
last several—you could say 24 or 48 
hours was held up because one commit-
tee’s product wasn’t considered, and 
your side said it wanted it considered 
before we could move forward. And, 
guess what, we accommodated that. 
So we now have a work product that 
is, I think, ready to be voted on—again, 
in a bipartisan fashion, working to-
gether with both leaders and with com-
mittee chairs and the ranking mem-
bers. So I object to the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to the modification. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I just want to reit-
erate again what we have dealt with. 
As originally introduced, the bill was 
160 pages. Yes, it ran through com-
mittee. Then it went out of committee, 
and it was reported out by the com-
mittee at 730 pages. Then you had the 
May 19 substitute—1,445 pages—and 
you had a substitute today that took it 
up to over 2,300 pages. Then at 10:59 
p.m., just a little over an hour and a 
half ago, we received notice of this 
managers’ package. The list that we re-
ceived is a simple list of numbers at-
tached to last names. It doesn’t con-
tain the text of those; it just contains 
references back to other amendments— 
10:59 p.m. We still don’t know exactly 
how long that is. 
Yet people are fond of saying, well, as 
I believe my colleague from Wash-
ington said a minute ago, people have 
been talking about this for hours. What 
does that even mean? It is not the 
same as presenting an amendment, 
saying this will be presented as a pack-
age. 
Keep in mind, these aren’t just mere 
sequential pages, pieces of paper. Every 
time you add another piece of paper, 
every time you add an amendment, it

gets a lot more complicated because 
you have to know not just what each 
page says but how it interacts with 
every other page. 
Although this is how it came out of 
committee, this is the rest of the bill 
as it existed as of early this morning. 
As of this afternoon, we added about 
another 900 pages to it. Then at 10:59, 
again, just about an hour and a half 
ago, 
we 
received 
an 
as-yet-to-be- 
ascertained managers’ package that we 
still haven’t seen in its entirety. We 
have just seen a list, and we are told 
that we have to vote on that right now. 
Look, the American people under-
stand that when you are throwing 
around hundreds of billions of dollars 
at a time, we really have an obligation 
to know what on Earth we are voting 
for. We don’t know that. We can’t 
credibly maintain that. We certainly 
shouldn’t pretend to be competent to 
understand everything that is in here. 
I find it absolutely stunning—I find 
it disappointing more than anything 
that in response to the very reasonable 
request made by my friend and distin-
guished colleague from Wisconsin to 
give us 3 hours to look at it, that even 
that was too much. 
This, Mr. President, is too much for 
the American people, and I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, to 
recap this process, I respect every 
Member’s right to express their opin-
ion. That is what regular order is 
about. 
In committee, we had 233 amend-
ments filed. My colleague from Utah 
filed 130 of those. So, yes, the Com-
merce Committee staff worked through 
130 of Senator LEE’s amendments. That 
is a lot of amendments to work 
through. I guarantee you, I am sure we 
probably would have liked a little more 
crystalized concerns and opposition 
than 130-plus amendments. We ended 
up putting 14 of them in the managers’ 
amendment. We ended up voting on 
five more during the committee proc-
ess. So, yes, I could have been frus-
trated 
with 
that, but we worked 
through those amendments. 
Now there is this process on the floor 
where my colleague is concerned and 
upset over 900 pages that he voted to 
accept. The moment to be concerned 
about those 900 pages, he could have 
objected, but he didn’t but now wants 
to revisit that decision. 
So I can propound many requests 
here, and we can continue to discuss 
these, but our colleagues—our leader-
ship on both sides of the aisle have 
worked through a process of regular 
order with our colleagues on a host of 
36 different amendments where—I am 
looking at this list—many of them are 
bipartisan, and I think those Members 
deserve to have a vote on their amend-
ments. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1527 WITHDRAWN 
Mr. President, I withdraw amend-
ment 1527. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has that right. 
The amendment (No. 1527) is with-
drawn. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1858 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1502 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment 1858 and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CORNYN], for 
himself and Mr. COTTON, proposes an amend-
ment numbered 1858. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To modify the semiconductor in-
centives program of the Department of 
Commerce) 
On page 349, beginning on line 23, strike 
‘‘expended.’’ and all that follows through 
page 350, line 13 and insert the following: 
expended.’’. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last 
year Senator WARNER, the senior Sen-
ator from Virginia, and I introduced 
the CHIPS for America Act to help 
shore up vulnerable supply chains for 
semiconductors and to reduce our reli-
ance on other countries for the most 
critical components of everything from 
the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter to the 
cell phones in our pockets and every-
thing in between. 
The vast majority of our colleagues 
have agreed that this is a critical task. 
It 
was 
carefully 
crafted 
after 
monthslong bipartisan, bicameral ne-
gotiations. In fact, this legislation was 
adopted as an amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act by a 
vote of 96 to 4 at the end of last year. 
But now we need to fund the program 
we created, and there is just one issue 
standing in the way. 
During committee consideration of 
the Endless Frontier Act, an amend-
ment was adopted that would apply 
controversial and unprecedented pre-
vailing wage language to the CHIPS for 
America Act signed into law last year. 
This provision creates a needless hur-
dle to funding for the CHIPS provision. 
Considering the current wages of U.S. 
semiconductor manufacturing compa-
nies, there is zero benefit—zero ben-
efit—to workers’ wages. So this is real-
ly a nonissue in terms of the compensa-
tion that workers in semiconductor 
manufacturing facilities will make. 
What is more, these Davis-Bacon provi-
sions represent an expansion of special 
interest labor policy to private con-
struction projects and set a disturbing 
precedent. 
Leaving this language in the bill is a 
gratuitous act and could dramatically 
weaken support for the broader legisla-
tion, and I would hope we could all 
agree that the stakes are simply too 
high to let that happen. So I have in-
troduced an amendment to strike this 
unnecessary and divisive language and 
maintain strong bipartisan support for 
this program. A partisan provision 
with zero benefit to workers’ wages is 
hardly a reason to gamble with strong 
support for the CHIPS Act. 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
have 
worked hard together to bolster our do-
mestic semiconductor manufacturing 
and to confront one of the most dan-
gerous, looming threats from China. 
Now is not the time to sacrifice the 
progress we have made. So I would en-
courage my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support this amendment so 
we can maintain the strong bipartisan 
support for this critical legislation and 
send a message to our adversaries that 
the United States intends to stay the 
world’s preeminent economic and mili-
tary power. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I men-
tioned earlier that there is no doubt 
this bill did go through more regular 
order than we have been used to over 
the last decade. But I think we also 
demonstrated that the massiveness of 
this bill, close to a quarter trillion dol-
lars, over 2,300 pages, many of those 
pages dumped on us today, and now 
this managers’ amendment package— 
we haven’t seen it; a few Members 
have—does not represent adequate reg-
ular order. 
I also did not have much participa-
tion in the development of that man-
agers’ package. I realize that a couple 
of my amendments did get in there, 
certainly not my priority amendments. 
I will talk later about the one that ac-
tually got a vote. I only got one vote 
on one amendment, and that vote was 
to simply honor the contracts that we 
have outstanding, about $2 billion 
worth to build the additional 250 miles 
of wall to secure our border. But I will 
come back to that. 
Right now I would like to talk about 
four of my—I probably had about a 
dozen amendments but four priority 
amendments that we tried to get in 
this managers’ package. There was no 
consultation 
with 
me 
personally, 
maybe a little bit of back-and-forth 
with staff. 
The first amendment really would 
have codified something we passed 
twice out of my committee when I was 
chair of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee. It was called the GOOD Act, 
Guidance Out of Darkness. President 
Trump issued an Executive order, 
which basically ordered the Agencies 
to publish the guidance that they were 
creating so that the American public 
would know what the regulations were 
expected of them, so they understood 
the rules of the road were—a good piece 
of transparency in government. It 
passed unanimously twice out of my 
committee. For some reason, President 
Biden on his first couple of days in of-
fice reversed that Executive order. 
So now we have, literally, executive 
Agencies pulling down these websites 
so the American public doesn’t even 
know what guidances they are expected 
to follow. So that would have been a

May 27, 2021 
very simple amendment. Again, it 
passed twice out of my committee 
unanimously. That didn’t make it into 
the managers’ package. 
One amendment that I had also in-
troduced—actually was voted on during 
the debate over the Iran Nuclear 
Agreement—simply stated that any 
new agreement with Iran that this ad-
ministration enters into should be 
deemed a treaty. That is what should 
have happened in the Obama adminis-
tration. When the JCPOA was just en-
tered into as an executive agreement 
but literally was no better than the 
piece of paper it was written on be-
cause the next President could just do 
away with it, and that is exactly what 
happened. 
So this is a very simple amendment. 
Quite honestly, this should pass 100 to 
0. Every U.S. Senator should demand, 
when you have an agreement between 
two nations as significant as the 
JCPOA, or whatever this administra-
tion might enter into with Iran, it 
should be deemed a treaty, and it 
should come before this body for ratifi-
cation by two-thirds of this body. That 
should have been included in this man-
agers’ amendment, but it wasn’t. 
One threat that this Nation faces— 
and this relates, I believe, directly to 
China because China, in their own mili-
tary doctrine, does not recognize a 
high-altitude nuclear blast as a nuclear 
attack. A high-altitude nuclear blast, 
otherwise known as an EMP, could 
wipe out our electrical grid. And for as 
long as I have been serving here, ad-
ministrations of both parties have not 
paid adequate attention to this. 
So this amendment, vital to our na-
tional security, also should have been 
included in the managers’ package, but 
it wasn’t. Why not? This is perfectly 
suited to this piece of legislation. This 
is an important national security pri-
ority, and this was left out of the man-
agers’ packet. 
I would like to have a little bit more 
time working on this legislation to in-
sist that this at least gets an up-or- 
down vote because I pretty well as-
sumed that this would be accepted by 
both sides and not objected to, but it 
wasn’t. Again, EMP, or geomagnetic 
disturbance, could represent an exis-
tential threat to this Nation, but it 
was simply ignored. It wasn’t included. 
And then the final amendment that 
was a priority of mine was the SOFA 
Act. We are all fully aware of the fact 
that in this Nation, we have a crisis of 
overdoses—of things like heroin and 
fentanyl. It is plaguing all of our com-
munities, large and small, every State. 
No Member of Congress is unaware of 
this. We have all heard the tragic sto-
ries from our constituents. 
One of the problems with fentanyl is 
the way it is scheduled to be illegal. 
And the problem with that is there are 
analogs. You can change the molecular 
makeup of fentanyl very easily, and 
then all of a sudden it is not scheduled 
as being an illegal substance. 
All this amendment would have done 
is codified what the DEA has been 
doing for a number of years, but the 
DEA regulation has run out. 
So one more time—this is completely 
bipartisan. There is no controversy to 
this 
amendment 
whatsoever—com-
pletely, directly related to this piece of 
legislation. It is trying to protect this 
Nation against China’s malign actions. 
This amendment was left out of this 
package. 
You might get some measure of sense 
of why I am not happy with the man-
agers’ package, why I think this body 
should take a little bit more time to 
deliberate; take a few more votes on 
amendments like this that, again, 
should be passed unanimously but were 
overlooked because, I guess, the only 
people really consulted, in terms of 
amendments, were those that they felt 
they could figure out how to get their 
vote. 
And I was pretty solid from the 
standpoint that I didn’t want to vote 
for a quarter of a trillion dollars to 
government Agencies that I don’t 
think are going to spend that money 
particularly effectively. 
I would like to talk about one 
amendment that I did get a vote on. 
Unfortunately, it was voted down on a 
largely party-line vote. The Senator 
from 
West 
Virginia—both 
Senators 
from West Virginia, but the one who 
does not caucus with us was the only 
Senator from the other side of the aisle 
that supported this piece of legislation. 
When I introduced this amendment, I 
came down to the floor and I talked 
about there was a time—and that time 
wasn’t very long ago—when border se-
curity was actually bipartisan. Secur-
ing our border, an imperative to na-
tional security, was a bipartisan goal. 
Evidence of that was in 2006, the Sen-
ate passed a piece of legislation called 
the Secure Fence Act of 2006. What 
that piece of legislation would do—was 
supposed to do—was build 700 miles of 
double-layer fencing, 700 miles. Now, in 
the end, only 36 miles of double-layer 
fencing was built. The other 613 miles 
was built, but 299 miles of that was just 
a vehicle fencing. In other words, pe-
destrians 
can 
easily 
walk 
right 
through. Another 314 miles was a sin-
gle-layer pedestrian fence that, unfor-
tunately, pedestrians can almost hop 
over, but they can scale and defeat 
that fence very easily. 
Now, again, proving the bipartisan 
nature of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, 
it passed the Senate overwhelmingly 
with a vote of 80 to 19. Twenty-six 
Democrats joined 54 Republicans in 
voting yes. In the House, the Secure 
Fence Act passed by a vote of 283 to 
138, with 64 Democrats voting yes. 
So, in total, the Secure Fence Act of 
2006 passed Congress with a combined 
total vote of 363 votes for and 157 votes 
against. In other words, 70 percent of 
Members of Congress back then voted 
yes, and 90 Democrat ensured that it 
was bipartisan support. 
By the way, notable Democrats who 
voted for it were the majority leader of 
this body today, the Senator from New 
York. President Obama voted for it. 
President Biden voted for it. Secretary 
of State Clinton voted for it. The chair-
man of Homeland Security, and then 
my ranking member when I was chair-
man, Senator TOM CARPER, voted for it, 
Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator WYDEN. 
And Senator SHERROD BROWN voted for 
it as a House Member back in 2006. 
We need a fence. Walls work. I think 
we admitted that fact after January 6, 
when we put a double layer of 7- or 8- 
foot-high 
fencing, 
concertina-tipped 
wire, and left it up for way longer than 
it needed to be left up. 
So here in Congress, we are happy to 
put up a fence, put up walls, as long as 
it is protecting us. I mean, it is about 
time that we build a wall to protect 
the rest of America. 
Now, what my amendment did is it 
simply required the administration to 
complete construction on the part of 
the wall that has already been con-
tracted. We build about 450 miles; 250 
has been contracted. We are going to 
have to pay for it whether we build it 
or not, and that is all my amendment 
is. Don’t waste American taxpayer 
money, which, if we don’t pass my 
amendment, that is exactly what is 
going to happen. 
I do want to take a little bit of time, 
seeing as we have a lot of time here to-
night—and we intend to take that time 
tonight—I want to lay out the history 
of the current problem. So my first 
chart here is detailing unaccompanied 
minors that are apprehended at the 
southern border. And these minors are 
from Central America, from Honduras, 
Guatemala, and El Salvador. 
Now, I want my colleagues to notice 
that in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, we 
never had more than 4,431 unaccom-
panied children cross our border ille-
gally and be apprehended. As a matter 
of fact, in 2007, there is less than 2,000 
people. In 2008, 4,380; in 2009, 3,288; in 
2010, 4,431; and then in 2011, 3,038. So we 
average under 4,000 unaccompanied 
children crossing the border illegally 
and being apprehended in those 5 years. 
Then something happened. And what 
happened was the Deferred Action on 
Childhood 
Arrivals 
memorandum. 
When President Obama got frustrated 
that the deliberative process wasn’t de-
livering him the border security or the 
immigration reform that he wanted, he 
used his pen. And he did what I cer-
tainly did not believe was constitu-
tional. As a matter of fact, a couple of 
years before that, he said he didn’t 
have the constitutional authority to do 
this, but he did it anyway. It has been 
challenged in the courts ever since. 
But the most significant thing about 
the Deferred Action for Childhood Ar-
rivals, other than its unconstitution-
ality, is what it sparked, what it was a 
catalyst for. You notice those who 
passed in June 2012 and, lo and behold— 
and it is not a coincidence—in 2012, all 
of a sudden that less than 4,000 annual 
average became 10,000. The following 
year, 2013, 20,805 unaccompanied chil-
dren entered the country illegally and

May 27, 2021 
were apprehended. And 2014 was the 
crisis year. That is when President 
Obama even admitted that this was a 
humanitarian crisis. We had 51,726 un-
accompanied children exploiting our 
immigration laws, our asylum laws, all 
because of DACA. 
By the way, what happened in Cen-
tral America with the passage of DACA 
was the coyotes—human traffickers, 
some of the most evil people on the 
planet—I will talk about that later. 
They talked about the fact that Amer-
ica changed their policy. Now, as an 
unaccompanied child, you can get into 
America. You get a piece of paper. It is 
called ‘‘permiso,’’ permission to enter 
the country. That is not what it was at 
all. It was a ‘‘notice to appear.’’ Do you 
know what? Coyotes lie. They lied to 
Central Americans. So vulnerable chil-
dren put themselves in the hands of, 
again, some of the most evil people on 
the planet. That sparked that crisis. 
Now, the Obama Administration re-
acted. I remember going down, when I 
became chairman of the committee, on 
a bipartisan trip to the border, down to 
McAllen, TX. At that point in time, 
Customs and Border Patrol were over-
whelmed, but they did what Customs 
and Border Patrol often do. They rose 
to the challenge. They dealt with this 
humanitarian crisis as humanely as 
they possibly could. They built a facil-
ity. They put up chain-link fences to 
keep the children safe—the young ones 
from the older ones or from the adults. 
On a bipartisan basis, we sung Customs 
and Border Patrol’s praises. 
Fast forward to the crisis of 2018–2019, 
and, all of a sudden, that exact same 
facility, it was actually upgraded. It 
was better than it was. It was more hu-
mane. All of a sudden, my Democratic 
colleagues started calling that facility 
one that housed children in cages. 
What hypocrisy. 
You can see through 2019, once the 
Obama Administration started detain-
ing families together, they stemmed 
the tide. But that didn’t last for long, 
as I will demonstrate on my next 
chart. 
On a quick explanation of this chart, 
the gold bars are single adults. It has 
been an ongoing problem we are always 
going to have in some way, shape, or 
form—single adults coming to this 
country illegally through the south-
western border. What we never had in 
the past was this surge, this crisis level 
of illegal immigration by children and 
families. 
By the way, some are real families; 
many are not. Many are families of one 
adult and one child. Sometimes they 
are a child who has been sold to them. 
In my committee, we heard testimony 
of a child being sold for $84. We heard 
of children being recycled to be used by 
multiple adults so they can come as a 
family and exploit our laws. 
Let me explain how they exploit 
them. This chart starts in 2012 with the 
passage of DACA. Again, single adults 
are gold, red are unaccompanied chil-
dren, blue are family units. You can 
see the humanitarian crisis in 2014. It 
doesn’t look like much of a crisis com-
pared to 2018 and our current crisis, 
which this administration is com-
pletely denying—completely denying. 
We had Secretary Mayorkas in front 
of our committee 2 weeks ago. I can’t 
tell you how surreal it was as he 
blamed the previous administration for 
the crisis he created. He talked about 
how it is getting better: It is improving 
because we are getting more efficient. 
We are getting more efficient at proc-
essing and dispersing. 
That is not solving the problem. 
Let me go back because what this 
chart does is it has the cause and ef-
fect. DACA is the catalyst of all of 
this. It sparked it all. It made citizens 
of Central America realize that the im-
migration system was broken and eas-
ily exploitable. You can see where 
President Obama declares the 2014 cri-
sis a ‘‘humanitarian crisis.’’ 
Then President Obama instituted a 
family detention policy, a consequence. 
You couldn’t just cross into America 
and get dispersed throughout the coun-
try, never to show up for your immi-
gration hearing, move into the shad-
ows, potentially be exploited by human 
traffickers and their agents here in 
America. And that actually helped 
stem the problem. It pretty well solved 
the problem until a court reinterpreted 
the Flores decision. 
The Flores decision dates back many 
years, about one little girl who came to 
this country. It established standards— 
humanitarian standards—which I don’t 
disagree with. America is a humane na-
tion. We are a nation of immigrants, 
but it has to be a legal process. The 
Flores decision dealt with unaccom-
panied minors and made sure that they 
could always stay in CBP’s, Customs 
Border Protection’s, custody and ICE’s 
custody for only so long before they 
had to be turned over to Health and 
Human Services to then find sponsors 
or parents. But there is a time limit on 
it. 
What 
the 
Flores 
reinterpretation 
did—and I think incorrectly, as did 
President Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh 
Johnson, who completely disagreed 
with the decision—that court—that 
unelected court—pretty much out of 
plain cloth or whole cloth said: Oh, no, 
the Flores decision or agreement ap-
plies to accompanied children, as well. 
It didn’t, but all of a sudden it did by 
court order. 
That created some real problems for 
the Obama Administration. They had 
to choose: Do they continue to detain 
families as a deterrent, as a con-
sequence to fix this problem, or do they 
separate them so they could detain the 
adult while they complied with the law 
under the court decision? Well, what 
they decided to do—and I can’t fault 
them for this—is they kept the families 
together and they dispersed them all. 
That really instituted the process, the 
policy—the horrible policy of catch and 
release, almost open borders. 
Now, it took a while for people to un-
derstand what was happening. It took a 
couple of years, but by the summer of 
2019, citizens of Central America were 
well aware of how exploitable our laws 
were. And guess what. They exploited 
them. 
I certainly learned from the experi-
ence of Michael Chertoff back in—I be-
lieve it was—2008. It might have been 
an earlier year, when we had a surge of 
Brazilians coming into Mexico and 
then coming illegally into this country 
through the southern border. I don’t 
have the exact numbers, but I think it 
is something like 30,000 in a short pe-
riod of time. What Secretary Chertoff 
did at that point in time is he insti-
tuted 
a 
program 
called 
‘‘Texas 
Hold’Em.’’ Basically, it was a con-
sequence, to apprehend Brazilians and 
send them right back to Brazil. 
Within a month, the flow of illegal 
Brazilians was cut by about 90 percent. 
Problem solved. There was a con-
sequence. We didn’t have catch and re-
lease of Brazilians like we now had, 
and we have again catch and release of 
Central Americans coming into this 
Country. 
Based on that experience working 
with the senior Senator of Arizona, 
who was on my committee, we pro-
posed 
something 
called 
‘‘Operation 
Safe Return.’’ The basic premise of 
that program would be, once appre-
hended, we would quickly adjudicate 
that initial asylum claim to see wheth-
er there really was a valid, credible 
fear. 
Understand, if adjudicated, most of 
the people coming into this country do 
not have a valid asylum claim. As gen-
erous as our asylum system is, coming 
here for economic reasons is not a valid 
asylum claim. That is the majority of 
why people come here. What became of 
Operation Safe Return, to a certain ex-
tent, is the Trump administration’s 
policy of migrant protection program, 
also known as ‘‘Return to Mexico’’—a 
consequence. 
Again, I called my program Oper-
ation Safe Return: Quickly adjudicate 
those who don’t have a valid asylum 
claim and safely return them to Cen-
tral America. 
I would have been happy to expend 
funds to make sure there were centers 
to accept people so they could be ac-
cepted safely. The Trump administra-
tion, instead, instituted the migrant 
protection program, return to Mexico. 
I realize there are people who don’t 
particularly like that program, but it 
worked. 
It 
is 
undeniable 
that 
it 
worked. They instituted it right here. 
Mexico wasn’t particularly cooper-
ating. So President Trump threatened 
them with tariffs. All of a sudden it got 
Mexico’s attention. Mexico started co-
operating, and you can see how the 
numbers dropped precipitously. We ba-
sically stopped the flow of children and 
children being used to create family 
units, and we had the problem solved 
before COVID hit. This is how you 
solve the problem. 
Unfortunately, during the 2020 elec-
tion, every Democratic Presidential

candidate vowed to stop deportations 
and 
also 
vowed 
to 
provide 
free 
healthcare. 
I don’t deny the push factor out of 
Central America. I don’t deny the vio-
lence, the corruption. When I went 
down there on a bipartisan codel, I was 
surprised talking to the Presidents of 
Guatemala and Honduras. They talked 
about corruption and impunity. 
I understand corruption. But what do 
you mean by impunity? 
Well, impunity is pervasive in their 
society because of the drug cartels. 
Why do we have drug cartels down in 
Central America? It is because of 
America’s insatiable demand for drugs. 
That is the root cause. The root cause 
of this problem, the push factor, isn’t 
the violence. The root cause is our in-
satiable demand for drugs, which puts 
billions of dollars in the pockets of the 
other most evil people on the planet, 
the drug cartels, the drug traffickers. 
By the way, what we did in our drug 
interdiction, relatively successfully, is 
we shut down the drug flow from Co-
lombia up to the Caribbean into Flor-
ida, and we just redirected it into Cen-
tral America and destroyed those na-
tions because those drug cartels are 
untouchable—they are untouchable. 
One story I heard is about a new po-
lice chief and first day on the job. He 
gets a DVD, and the DVD is of his wife 
and children going to church, going 
into school—a pretty powerful mes-
sage: Don’t mess with us. And they 
don’t. 
So that level of impunity from drug 
cartels becomes pervasive through so-
ciety. Then you have the extortionists. 
If you are a cab driver, you had better 
pay the fee or they will shoot you and 
burn you in your cab. That is what im-
punity means. That level of violence is 
facilitated by our insatiable demand 
for drugs. 
If you are going to fix that root 
cause, if you are going to solve the 
problem of violence in Central Amer-
ica, you have to actually fix the root 
cause, which is our insatiable demand 
for drugs. I wish we could. I wish it was 
easy to do. It is not. We want to stop il-
legal immigration so that we can fix 
the problem of the DACA kids and so 
we can establish a legal immigration 
system that works for all of us. 
I mentioned my codel down to Cen-
tral America. The Presidents of Cen-
tral America tell me—they beg me: 
Please, fix your laws. This isn’t good 
for our countries. We are losing our fu-
ture. We need these people. 
The vast majority, I would argue, are 
hard-working and are coming here to 
improve their lives. I can’t blame them 
for that, but it has to be a legal proc-
ess. 
That is not working for Central 
America. It is going to further impov-
erish Central America. It is not an eco-
nomic model that works. 
It is certainly not good for migrants 
who come to this country to live in the 
shadows and who are still under the 
control of the drug cartels and human 
traffickers or are in gangs, especially 
the young men. The 15-, 16-, and 17- 
year-olds are used by the drug traf-
fickers to traffic drugs. The sex trade 
is the other involuntary servitude. 
This is not a good process. We need 
to solve the problem of illegal immi-
gration and control our borders so we 
can have a functioning legal immigra-
tion system. 
What happened? What caused this? 
Isn’t it obvious? 
You could see the increase in adults 
coming into this country illegally dur-
ing the Presidential debates when the 
Democratic 
Presidential 
candidates 
were going: Hey, if I get elected Presi-
dent, no more deportations. I am going 
to give you free healthcare. We will 
take care of you. 
That was a huge incentive, and they 
came. 
Then I think it was the first day, 
maybe the second day—maybe he wait-
ed that long—when President Biden 
dismantled the successful migrant pro-
tection program, ‘‘Remain in Mexico,’’ 
and the rest is a very, very, very sad 
history. 
I will leave that up. 
Now, I mentioned that 2 weeks ago 
we had Secretary Mayorkas come be-
fore our committee, and it was surreal 
the way they denied that they had any-
thing to do with this, that this was an 
inherited problem. I mean, if it were 
inherited, yes, it was inherited by the 
Obama administration in DACA and in 
an incorrect court decision in the Flo-
res reinterpretation. I will admit it was 
inherited there. It wasn’t inherited 
here. The problem had been solved. It 
had been fixed. 
What is so tragic about this is that 
we had pretty well taken the first step 
to solving the problem, to having im-
migration reform, to controlling the 
border. Keep these successful policies 
in place, and build the fence. Then you 
can address DACA. Then you can set up 
a functioning legal immigration sys-
tem. 
Unfortunately, I only had one round 
of 
questions—only 
7 
minutes—with 
Secretary Mayorkas. Again, as he was 
dodging responsibility, I didn’t get to 
ask a lot of questions. Here is the list 
of questions that I wanted to ask Sec-
retary Mayorkas in a second round 
that I didn’t get. 
I wanted to ask Secretary Mayorkas 
whether or not he was aware that 
human traffickers sell children to 
adults so they can exploit our asylum 
laws as posing as a family unit. I want-
ed to know whether he was aware of 
that. I am quite sure the Vice Presi-
dent is, because the Vice President was 
on my committee. She heard this testi-
mony. She should be aware of it. She 
should go down to the border. 
I wanted to ask him: Are you aware 
that we heard testimony, under my 
chairmanship, that a child was sold for 
$84? 
I wanted to ask Secretary Mayorkas: 
Are you aware that children are recy-
cled—that they are sent back over the 
border to be used by another adult to 
pose as a family unit and exploit our 
asylum laws? 
I wanted to ask him: How are you 
verifying that a child belongs to an 
adult? 
In one of my trips down to the border 
and in having heard that children were 
being sold, that they were being recy-
cled, that many of these family units 
weren’t real family units, I saw about a 
50-year-old man. He was holding, prob-
ably, about a 2-year-old little girl. 
Now, I can’t be sure as I don’t speak 
Spanish, and I don’t think he would 
have admitted it, but my assessment 
was that she was not his little girl. 
On that same trip, we heard about a 
little 3-year-old boy having been aban-
doned in a hot cornfield, with a tele-
phone number written on his shoe, be-
cause the adult for whom he was posing 
as that person’s child didn’t need him 
anymore and just abandoned him. 
I wanted to ask the Secretary: Are 
they doing DNA tests, and, if so, what 
percentage of family units are being 
tested? 
I wanted to ask the Secretary: Is he 
aware that human traffickers throw 
children out of their rafts when they 
are interdicted by law enforcement? 
When we were down at the border 
with 18 of my colleagues, we saw a 
floating body in the Rio Grande. The 
next day, a 9-year-old girl drowned in 
the Rio Grande. During one of my hear-
ings, I showed a picture—it wasn’t a 
fun picture to show, but I thought it 
was something we should see—of Oscar 
Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his 2- 
year-old daughter, Valeria, face down. 
They had drowned in the Rio Grande. 
I wanted to ask Secretary Mayorkas: 
Is he aware of the fact that migrant 
girls are given birth control because 
they know such a large percentage is 
going to be raped during the dangerous 
journey that President Biden’s policies 
are incentivizing? 
I wanted to know whether Secretary 
Mayorkas 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
kidnappings, the beatings, the abuse, 
and the additional ransoms demanded 
by the human traffickers. 
I wanted to know whether he knows 
how 
much 
the 
human 
traffickers 
charge for their human prey and if he 
is knowledgeable in how they pay off 
their debt. Some pay in advance. Some 
don’t have the money. Some pay later. 
How do you think a pretty, young girl 
pays off her human trafficking debt? 
How do you think a young minor—a 15- 
, 16-, 17-year-old boy—who can traffic 
drugs pays off his debt? I think it is 
pretty obvious. 
I wanted to know: Does he know how 
many young girls are forced into the 
sex trade and how many young men are 
forced into involuntary servitude or 
used to traffic drugs or are gang mem-
bers? I wanted to know. 
I wanted to know if he was fully 
aware of how President Biden’s policies 
created this crisis and how those poli-
cies are facilitating the multibillion- 
dollar business model of some of the

most evil people on the planet. I want-
ed to know. I still want to know. 
I think this administration and I 
think Secretary Mayorkas need to be 
held accountable for this human trag-
edy. Apparently, these policies are 
meant to be more humane. They are 
the exact opposite. The degradations 
and the inhumanity are untold. They 
are only growing, and they are con-
tinuing. 
Again, what is so tragic about all of 
this, in addition to the human tragedy, 
is the fact that we were so close. We 
had pretty well taken that first step in 
any 
immigration 
reform. 
We 
had 
stopped the flow or had dramatically 
reduced it, and we were building the 
fence. There are only 250 miles yet to 
build that we have already paid for. 
What a waste of the American tax-
payers’ money if we don’t even com-
plete that fence and what a waste of an 
opportunity that we can’t take that 
first step—complete that first step—for 
true immigration reform. 
This amendment was voted on and 
defeated, largely, on a party-line vote. 
Only the senior Senator from West Vir-
ginia joined us, and it is just such a 
shame. 
You know, America hungers for com-
ity. America hungers for bipartisan-
ship. This is the kind of bipartisanship 
they would appreciate that doesn’t 
mortgage our future and that actually 
fixes a problem as opposed to the bill 
we are considering right now. The bi-
partisanship that always concerns me 
is a mad spending spree—deficit spend-
ing—wherein, over the last 18 months, 
we have already spent about $7 trillion 
that we don’t have. I am shocked, by 
the way, by the reports that the Presi-
dent’s budget is going to be $6 trillion, 
to be announced tomorrow, and an-
other $7 trillion in other types of—it 
boggles your mind. That is not the 
right kind of bipartisanship. That is 
the type of bipartisanship that mort-
gages our children’s future and bank-
rupts this Nation. 
I think I have probably had enough 
time here, and I see that a number of 
my colleagues would also like to make 
a few points. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to make two points. 
First, I want to associate myself with 
the remarks of some of my colleagues 
earlier about the fact that we don’t 
know what is in this bill. That is not a 
criticism of anyone or any party. You 
can only absorb so much. If you define 
our job, at least in part, as rep-
resenting our people and knowing what 
we are voting on when we vote, I would 
respectfully suggest we would be better 
off having our staff vote. Now, I doubt 
there is more than one or two or, 
maybe, three staff members who really 
know or who have a global, macro, pic-
ture of what is in the bill, but at least 
our staffs know more about it than we 
do. That is not a criticism of anybody 
or any party. That is just a fact. 
I think, if you were to just pick 10 
Senators at random and ask them off 
the record, ‘‘Do you know what is in 
this bill? Not every word, but do you 
have a general idea of everything in 
this bill?’’ 9 out of 10 would tell you 
that they don’t, and the 10th is prob-
ably lying. 
Now, I have said before—and I really 
think that it is a shame. I have said be-
fore—and I meant it—that I know some 
of my colleagues better than others, 
but I think I know all of my colleagues 
in the Senate. These are the most in-
teresting, complex people—that is, in 
part, why they are interesting—whom I 
have ever been around. There are some 
enormously talented people in this 
body. Let me just pick one at random. 
When Senator SCOTT
doesn’t have 
time to understand or Senator DURBIN 
doesn’t have time to figure out every-
thing that is in the bill because things 
are moving so fast, that shortchanges 
all of us. They are talented people. 
They may be able to say something: 
What 
about 
this 
provision? 
This 
doesn’t make sense. What do you 
think, Senator KENNEDY? What do you 
think, Senator MURPHY? 
So that really bothers me. That is 
not a criticism of my Democratic 
friends, and that is not a criticism of 
the majority leader, Senator SCHUMER. 
It wasn’t any better when the Repub-
licans were in control. I just think that 
it is so sad, so unfortunate, and it is so 
avoidable. 
I understand that floor time is lim-
ited. So we want to do things quickly 
around here. But there is no law that 
says we can’t start earlier and work 
later. There is no law that says we 
can’t cooperate in terms of allowing 
the majority to have more floor time 
so that all of us have a greater oppor-
tunity to understand what we are vot-
ing on. 
I mean, excuse me, Senator SCOTT, 
look at that. I think that is only a por-
tion of the bill. Honestly. 
Now, the second point I wanted to 
make—I learned really quickly when I 
got here that Senators are like cats: 
They do what they want. Why is that? 
Because we have minority rights. Our 
rules pretty much are written to pro-
tect the minority. 
So a fair question is, Well, how do we 
ever get anything done? Well, we do it 
by consent. We couldn’t run this place 
without consent, and we give our con-
sent automatically to a lot of rel-
atively trivial matters, the day-to-day 
functioning of the Senate. Yet we don’t 
readily give our consent—or at least 
not as readily as we should—when we 
are dealing with more important mat-
ters, like the Endless Frontier Act. 
Now, I voted to get on this bill be-
cause I was told that we were going to 
have an open amendment process. In 
my judgment, we didn’t have an open 
amendment process. That is, again, not 
a criticism of the Democratic major-
ity, and it is not a criticism of Senator 
SCHUMER. It wasn’t a damn bit better 
when the Republicans had the major-
ity. It just wasn’t. 
An open amendment process, to me, 
means that any Senator should be able 
to come to this floor, respecting each 
other so that we allot ourselves time, 
and offer an amendment for all of us to 
hear. Now, obviously you can’t spend 20 
hours on one amendment, but if one 
wants to present an amendment, I 
think 5 minutes would be sufficient. We 
do that all the time in a vote-arama. 
When people—some people say, when 
I raised this issue, they say: Oh, vote- 
aramas are terrible because we are here 
all night. 
We don’t have to be here all night. 
You can start a vote-arama at 8 in the 
morning and stop at 5:30 or 6. That is 
an open amendment process. 
An open amendment—I was told we 
would have an open amendment proc-
ess. I wouldn’t have gotten on this bill 
otherwise. Now, I don’t know how it 
works on the Democratic side. I sus-
pect it works very similar to the way it 
works on our side. You have an amend-
ment, but you have to get the permis-
sion of other Senators to even offer 
your amendment. You have to go see 
the bill manager. You have to see the 
majority leader. You have to see the 
committee chairman. You have to see 
the ranking member. And anybody can 
say: No, I just don’t like your amend-
ment. And I think it works the same 
way on the Democratic side. That is 
not an open amendment process—not 
even close. 
You say: Well, why does it matter? 
You know, we have seniority, and we 
elect our leaders, and I get all of that, 
but nobody is infallible. I will give you 
a specific example. We are giving, in 
this bill, I am told—it could have 
changed overnight—but about $56 bil-
lion to the semiconductor industry. We 
are told we need to do that because the 
semiconductor industry—private semi-
conductor industry—is essential to our 
ability to compete with China. 
So far, so good. There are a lot of 
companies that are essential to com-
peting in the global economy—the fi-
nance industry, the energy industry, 
the banking industry. We have to eat. 
Farmers—you could marshal a pretty 
persuasive argument that they are es-
sential too. But this bill singles out the 
semiconductor industry for $56 billion, 
and I believe—I am not sure because it 
could have changed—that we are giving 
President Biden the authority to give 
up to $3 billion to each private com-
pany. So we are picking winners and 
losers. Some people like that; some 
people don’t. I get it. That is why God 
made votes. We will have a vote on it, 
but the fact is that we are doing it. 
Senator SANDERS had a very inter-
esting idea. In fact, it is an idea that I 
had on my side as well. He said: Look, 
if we are taking taxpayer money and 
we are giving it to private companies, 
why don’t we let the taxpayers partici-
pate in the upside? Why don’t we give 
taxpayers—you can’t give individual 
taxpayers, but you can certainly give, 
say, the Department of Treasury on be-
half of taxpayers warrants or stock op-
tions.

May 27, 2021 
So if President Biden—if this bill 
passes and President Biden exercises 
his authority to give $3 billion to XYZ 
Semiconductor 
Company, 
and 
the 
semiconductor company uses that cap-
ital wisely and triples its profits, and 
its stock goes up 233 percent, the 
American taxpayer has warrants or 
stock options. 
Now, I am not speaking for Senator 
SANDERS. I haven’t really had a chance 
to talk to Bernie about his idea; I am 
just intrigued by it. 
I had a similar idea. I wanted to use 
stock options on my side. By ‘‘my 
side,’’ I mean the Republican side. I of-
fered it up, and it is still floating 
around. It is probably in a black hole 
somewhere. None of the powers that be 
on my side that—they said: We are not 
going to let you do that. 
That is not an open amendment proc-
ess. It is honestly not. 
And I hear this business about reg-
ular order, and I am not arguing that 
we are not following regular order. It is 
just that regular order is irregular. 
I mean, this is an incredibly talented 
group of people, and we ought to be 
able to design a parliamentary proce-
dure that looks like somebody designed 
it on purpose so that every single Mem-
ber in this body has a chance to offer 
input and to have his or her ideas seri-
ously considered. And it won’t be an 
unwieldy process. We do it all the time 
with the vote-arama. 
Now, vote-aramas—I am going to 
come back to a point I made earlier, 
but I want to emphasize it. Vote- 
aramas can be painful. Nobody likes to 
stay up all night. But we don’t have to 
stay up all night. We can start at a rea-
sonable hour and end at a reasonable 
hour. 
And I dare say that if you took all 
the time that we have spent collec-
tively over the last week or so in the 
back rooms making deals, making side 
deals, saying ‘‘You can’t have your 
amendment’’; 
‘‘Yeah, 
I 
like 
your 
amendment’’; ‘‘No, that is a dumb 
idea,’’ none of which is transparent, 
until we come up, finally, with some 
kind of package that makes probably 
75 percent of the folks mad and mostly 
100 percent don’t know what is in it—if 
we took all the time that we spent on 
that and instead spent it by saying 
‘‘OK. Here is the bill. You have a rea-
sonable amount of time to understand 
what is in it, and now we are going to 
start the amendment process. There is 
going to be 5 minutes to present your 
amendment, and there will be 5 min-
utes to argue it by an opponent. We are 
going to really have 20-minute votes. 
We are going to start at a reasonable 
hour, and we are going to end at a rea-
sonable hour, and then we will come 
back and do it the next day,’’ yes, we 
will burn maybe 5, 6 days of floor time, 
but the minority party is going to co-
operate with the majority party in 
terms of helping it preserve floor time 
that it has to have to do other things 
that the majority party needs to do. 
Again, I am not criticizing Senator 
SCHUMER. The Republicans did the 
same thing when we had the majority. 
But I just think we are wasting an 
enormous amount of talent in this 
body by, A, not giving them a voice— 
witness 
Senator 
SANDERS’ 
warrant 
idea. I don’t know what happened on 
his side of the aisle. On my side of the 
aisle, when I brought it up, they killed 
it deader than a doornail, and that is 
not an open amendment process. 
We are also wasting an enormous 
amount of talent because we are not— 
in offering these ideas to each other, 
we are not getting the benefit of the 
wisdom of our colleagues. 
So I wanted to get that off my chest, 
and that is about all I have to say, and 
I appreciate your attention. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I want to thank my colleagues for their 
concerns about this bill. 
You know, I have been up here a lit-
tle over 2 years. I originally ran for of-
fice because I had the same concerns 
about where the State of Florida was 
going as I have concerns about where 
our Federal Government is going. 
I ran for Governor in 2010, and in the 
4 years ending at the end of 2010, the 
State of Florida had lost 832,000 jobs. 
Home prices dropped in half. We had I 
think close to a million people on un-
employment, and we had I think a lit-
tle over 1.1 million homes in fore-
closure. 
If you looked at all the articles, they 
said that opportunity for the Sunshine 
State was over. And I didn’t believe it. 
I believe that if you run government in 
a responsible manner, you have unbe-
lievable opportunities for individuals. 
The reason I believe this is, it is the 
life that I have had the opportunity to 
live in this country. 
I grew up in the—I was born in the 
great State of Illinois. We lived in pub-
lic housing. I had a single mom, and 
she told me that I could be anything. 
She said: If you will study hard, if you 
will go to church all the time, if you 
are an Eagle Scout and you go figure 
out how to work, there is no limita-
tion. You can build a company. You 
can do anything you want. 
I actually believed her, and I had the 
opportunity to do that. I built compa-
nies, employed a lot of people, and had 
a lot of opportunity. 
So I ran for Governor in 2010 with the 
belief that you could turn around the 
State of Florida. At the time, I believe 
there was—you know, the way the 
country and the State of Florida were 
going, it was not a great place for fami-
lies like mine growing up. So I ran a 
campaign of 7 steps to 700,000 jobs over 
7 years. You know, all the economists 
said, well, we couldn’t get 700,000 jobs 
in 7 years. It was not doable. Most of 
them said we couldn’t even get single- 
digit unemployment in 7 or 8 years. 
People wouldn’t move to the State. 
So I shocked everybody, and I won a 
primary and I won a general election, 
and I set about to do exactly what I 
said we could do. 
We reduced taxes. Every year, we 
watched how we spent the money. We 
allocated our dollars where we could 
get more jobs. We added 1.7 million 
jobs—not 700,000 jobs; we added 1.7 mil-
lion jobs. When we did that, what hap-
pened was, our revenues grew, and we 
were able to have record funding for 
education, for the environment, and for 
transportation. We ended up becoming 
No. 1 in higher education; I guess gen-
erally about the top five in K–12 edu-
cation; 47-year low in our crime rate; 
and record funding for things like the 
Everglades. 
So I believed you could do the same 
thing up here, and that is why I came 
up here. I came up here with the belief 
that if you start looking at how you 
spend the money—and the way we did 
it in Florida was, we had—there are 
about 4,000 lines to the budget, and we 
went through every line in the budget 
every year, and we said: Do we get a re-
turn? What do we get for that? If we 
didn’t get a return, then we didn’t do it 
the next year. So my goal is to do the 
exact same thing up here. 
Now let’s look at where our country 
is right now. We have almost $30 tril-
lion of debt. We are running multitril-
lion-dollar deficits. That is not sustain-
able. 
And, by the way, who are we going to 
hurt long term? It is not going to be 
the rich. It is going to be the poor. It 
is going to be the people on fixed in-
come. You can look at the numbers. 
Look at inflation numbers right now. 
Inflation is caused by reckless spend-
ing. That is what it is caused by. The 
spending we have done this year is un-
believable—$1.9 trillion. It was sup-
posedly for COVID, but it has very lit-
tle to do with COVID—less than 10 per-
cent—and 1 percent for vaccines. 
Let’s look at what has happened to 
inflation. In the 12 months that ended 
in April, the Consumer Price Index was 
up 4.2 percent. It is pretty surprising 
that we are up over 6 percent. Milk in 
12 months, up over 5 percent; bread 
over 7 percent, and gas over 51 percent. 
Now, if you have a lot of money, that 
is not going to change your life. But if 
you are struggling for food or you are 
struggling to put food on the table, a 5- 
percent or 7-percent increase has a 
pretty big impact. When you see that 
when the cost to fill up your gas tank 
to go to work dramatically increases, 
it has a pretty big impact. All this is 
caused by government spending—reck-
less government spending—excessive 
government spending. 
You can’t run trillion-dollar deficits. 
You can’t have a Federal Reserve that 
continues 
to 
buy 
treasuries 
every 
month without ending up with infla-
tion. And that is exactly where we are. 
The only way out of this is to start

this bill, there might be some good 
things in this bill, but we are spending 
money recklessly. 
So, I have a real concern. Why are we 
rushing through this? Why don’t we 
take the time—take the time so all

Americans have a chance to read it, 
know what is in it, tell us what they 
like, what they don’t like? Why rush 
through it, where nobody in this Cham-
ber knows everything that is in this 
bill? It is impossible. It has gone way 
too fast with all these amendments. 
There is no way this could even hap-
pen. 
CHINA 
Mr. President, the other thing I want 
to talk about is China. Communist 
China is an adversary. They are not a 
competitor. They have become an ad-
versary, and we have got to learn how 
to stand up. 
Just putting more money in a gov-
ernment program is not how we are 
going to compete with China. How we 
are going to compete with China is to 
build up American companies. Govern-
ment doesn’t do that. 
I have run a company. It is not what 
government does. 
This year marks the 75th anniversary 
of Winston Churchill’s speech to West-
minster College, where he famously de-
clared: ‘‘From Stettin in the Baltic to 
Trieste in the Adriatic an ‘‘iron cur-
tain’’ has descended across the con-
tinent.’’ For many, these words were 
seen as some of the first announcing 
the start of the Cold War. 
Today, the threat of communism is 
once again spreading across Eastern 
Europe. The malicious and oppressive 
government of Communist China has 
shown it is eager to assert its power 
across the globe, undermine democracy 
and human rights, violate U.S. sanc-
tions, and prop up dictators. 
We have to do something to figure 
out how to compete better against 
Communist China. The United States 
has to recognize that a new Cold War is 
upon us and, with our allies, confront 
this threat and defeat this spread of 
tyranny using every diplomatic and 
military option at our disposal. 
Communist China’s intentions for 
world domination are clear in its re-
cent $400 billion, 25-year deal with Iran 
to provide the Ayatollah with a steady 
military partner, investment source, 
and oil customer. Communist China 
has now secured a pathway to further 
extend the reach of its Belt and Road 
Initiative into the Middle East, while 
strengthening its relationship with the 
world’s greatest state sponsor of ter-
ror. This dangerous development comes 
as Communist China continues its as-
sault to destroy the democracy in Hong 
Kong, shows increased military aggres-
sion toward Taiwan, and furthers its 
embrace of Cuba’s abhorrent and op-
pressive Communist regime—not to 
speak of what they are doing down in 
Venezuela. 
The position we find ourselves in 
today is due to decades of appeasement 
by Washington politicians and cor-
porate America, an attitude that is 
carried on by many of President 
Biden’s Cabinet members. Throughout 
the 
confirmation 
process, 
nominee 
after nominee failed to show a true 
comprehensive comprehension of Com-
munist China’s threat to American se-
curity. Meanwhile, we continue to see 
American corporations put profits over 
people, ignoring Communist China’s 
horrible human rights abuses and the 
genocide it is committing to preserve 
their forced labor-driven supply chains. 
While I have no faith that Biden will 
be tough on China, I have welcomed 
and my colleagues have acknowledged 
the need to comprehensively combat 
the influence and power of Communist 
China through legislation. 
Sadly, we are squandering this oppor-
tunity. I want to be very clear. Any 
plan that tries to broker a compromise 
on issues over and above the needs of 
American national security, American 
jobs, or human rights will do nothing 
more than perpetuate the status quo. 
Since being elected to the U.S. Sen-
ate, I have sponsored and supported 
more than 40 pieces of legislation fo-
cused on addressing the security of our 
supply chain, holding communist China 
fully responsible for disgusting human 
rights abuses and genocide against 
Uighur Muslims, enhancing our ability 
to innovate and develop new tech-
nology, and countering Beijing’s unfair 
trade practices. 
This is where our legislative efforts 
must begin. We need to cut Communist 
China off from the American economy 
that it relies so heavily upon to feed its 
Communist oppression machine. There 
is no point in sacrificing our interests 
for the hope of compromise with a 
country that will never live up to its 
end of any agreement, is openly com-
mitting genocide against millions of 
Uighur 
Muslims, 
and 
continuously 
threatens not only America’s security 
but that of our allies in the Asia-Pa-
cific region. 
Communist China is focused on one 
thing—world domination through op-
pression and Communist rule. We must 
not be naive in thinking that Com-
munist China wants to operate in the 
modern world order and cooperate with 
other world powers. General Secretary 
Xi wants to reshape the world order 
into his image and is willing to strong- 
arm anyone who refuses to give in to 
his interests and those of the Chinese 
Communist Party. 
If Communist China wants to enact a 
plan of world domination, the United 
States must respond appropriately. 
The United States must demonstrate 
America’s strength and resolve, and 
our commitment to our allies. In this 
new Cold War, we have the chance to 
prove once again that the American 
style of government, free enterprise, 
and civil society remain the best sys-
tem in the world. 
As the world’s greatest beacon of 
freedom and democracy, the United 
States must do everything we can, in 
conjunction with our allies, to curb 
Communist 
China’s 
reach, 
counter 
their policies, and punish those who 
are guilty of the ongoing genocide 
against the Uighurs. Whether we like it 
or not, we are in a new Cold War with 
Communist China. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in ac-
tions that display the true resolve of 
the United States in addressing Com-
munist China’s destabilizing actions. 
Here is what I am talking about. For 
too long, the United States has fool-
ishly enabled Communist China’s op-
pressive dictatorship, which is now the 
greatest national and economic secu-
rity threat. Today, Communist China’s 
Belt and Road Initiative actively un-
dermines America’s standing around 
the world with a strategy to dominate 
militarily, economically, and techno-
logically. It has become clear that 
strategic decoupling from Communist 
China is the most effective way to 
limit General Secretary Xi Jinping’s 
power and protect American jobs and 
security. However, our politicians in 
Washington and business groups like 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce still 
argue that decoupling from Communist 
China hurts American businesses. They 
are wrong, blind to the plans of Gen-
eral Secretary Xi and the pain of his 
citizens, and are more concerned with 
short-term profits than the future of 
our country. 
As we chart a new course to advance 
American trade and interests, I believe 
we must adopt a bipartisan ‘‘freedom- 
first’’ strategy which protects freedom 
around the world from Communist Chi-
na’s growing power and aggression, re-
stores our country to global leadership, 
and keeps American interests first. 
What I am proposing is straight-
forward and achievable. First, we must 
acknowledge what has worked in our 
efforts to ensure free trade and keep 
policies in place that will hold Com-
munist China accountable. 
Next, the United States has to take 
decisive steps to strategically to re-
move Communist China from our sup-
ply chain while supporting the return 
of critical industries to American 
shores and promoting ‘‘buy American’’ 
policies. 
Third, we must engage the inter-
national community and secure the 
full support of our allies to create a 
maximum 
pressure 
campaign 
with 
Communist China until it comes into 
compliance with all U.S. and inter-
national trade laws. 
Finally, the United States must lead 
the world and take bold action to shine 
a light on and demand an end to Com-
munist China’s horrible human rights 
abuses and the horrific genocide it is 
committing on its own people. 
The Trump administration took un-
precedented action to thoroughly in-
vestigate Communist China’s trade 
practices and found it had long been 
committing forced technology trans-
fers, intellectual property theft, and 
espionage. The United States took ac-
tion over the past 4 years to prohibit 
Americans from investing in Chinese 
companies that support Communist 
China’s military, added those compa-
nies to a trade blacklist, banned im-
ports of cotton from China’s Xinjiang 
region over forced labor and protected 
American universities and research

labs from Chinese government spying 
and IP theft. 
In Congress, I have fought for more 
than a year to prevent the U.S. Govern-
ment from purchasing technology like 
drones with American tax dollars from 
Chinese companies backed by their 
government. We must keep these and 
other proven policies in place. It is 
time we acknowledge the fact that 
when American families buy products 
made in China, they are supporting 
this Communist regime. 
We must get Communist China out of 
our supply chain. We can do this 
through simultaneously separating ties 
from companies backed by the Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
and 
rebuilding 
American-made products. By properly 
labeling products with country-of-ori-
gin information and encouraging busi-
nesses to return home, we can end our 
trade inequity with Communist China 
and create countless American jobs 
that support families and communities 
across the Nation. 
While decoupling must begin now, we 
know it is not a process that will be 
completed overnight, and supply chains 
must readjust to remove themselves 
from the grasp of the Chinese Com-
munist Party. Knowing that Com-
munist China needs to live up to its 
agreements, the United States must 
lead the world in demanding the full 
enforcement of all U.S. and inter-
national trade laws. 
Organizations like the World Trade 
Organization can no longer sit in the 
pocket of Communist China, and the 
Biden administration must insist that 
the WTO enforce trade practices fairly. 
This will require a coalition-style ap-
proach and the United States is well 
positioned to lead this important work 
to create increased accountability and 
real consequences for the abusive trade 
practices that Communist China has 
relied on for too long. 
Finally, the freedom-loving nations 
of the world must ban together to say 
that 
Communist 
China’s 
egregious 
human rights violations won’t be ac-
cepted. General Secretary Xi is taking 
away the basic human rights of the 
people of Hong Kong and leading a bru-
tal genocide of Uighurs, imprisoning 
more than a million in concentration 
camps. The State Department cannot 
back down from officially designating 
this as genocide, and other countries 
must follow this example. 
That is why I led a bipartisan effort 
to 
demand 
that 
the 
International 
Olympic Committee move its 2022 Win-
ter Games out of Beijing unless Com-
munist China addresses these human 
rights abuses. The world is counting on 
the United States to stand firm against 
the use of slave labor in manufacturing 
and trade. 
With regard to the Olympics, there 
are 180 human rights organizations 
around the world that have asked for 
the Olympics to be moved. The Par-
liament in Canada has asked for the 
Olympics to be moved. The Inter-
national Olympic Committee has done 
nothing. It is despicable that inter-
national Olympics hasn’t already asked 
the Olympics to be moved or has not 
moved the Olympics, and I have asked 
for all the sponsors of international 
Olympics to work to try to make sure 
the Olympics gets moved. But Amer-
ican companies have to do their part to 
rid their supply chains of such abuses. 
The United States and so many coun-
tries around the globe stand for free-
dom of democracy for all people. Now 
we must unify and lead the important 
effort to accomplish this common goal, 
put American jobs and workers first, 
and counter the harm and unfair trade 
practices of Communist China that 
have been ignored for decades. 
But surrendering America’s strategic 
position to Communist China isn’t the 
only failure of the legislation we are 
considering today. The other equally 
significant dangerous issue is the addi-
tional deficit spending this bill in-
cludes, driving America even deeper 
into debt. 
Since first being elected to represent 
Florida, I have fought hard to call out 
wasteful spending and offer solutions 
to make our government accountable 
to the taxpayers. This should be the 
foundation of our work and service to 
our constituents. We can’t forget that 
every dollar the Federal Government 
spends is borrowed from the American 
people. 
Sadly, over the past 2 years that I 
have been in Washington, I realized 
that while many politicians make 
promises to uphold these values, few 
put their words into practice. It is no 
wonder, then, that our national debt 
continues to grow and grow and grow. 
In 2020 alone, the United States in-
creased its debt by more than $4 tril-
lion. Today, as we know, it is headed to 
$30 trillion. 
America is clearly in a debt crisis, 
and we need to start talking about it 
and take decisive action to reverse 
course. That is why every time I am 
faced with the question of spending 
taxpayer dollars on government pro-
grams, I ask myself some simple, yet 
important, questions: What is the plan 
to pay for it? What is the return on in-
vestment for American families? Are 
there other programs already doing the 
same thing? When was the last time 
this program was reviewed for its effec-
tiveness? Does the proposal include 
measures to prevent waste and fraud 
and ensure accountability? Are there 
unnecessary regulations making this 
more expensive than it needs to be? 
Asking these questions isn’t a novel 
idea. It is the same process I went 
through every day when I was Gov-
ernor of Florida. That is what most 
Americans go through when making fi-
nancial decisions at home or for their 
businesses. Families do it every night 
at their kitchen table. No family would 
needlessly spend money without a plan. 
No business can afford to not get a re-
turn on their investments. But here, 
there is no focus on return on invest-
ments. The bill we are talking about, 
we have no idea how much money we 
are going to spend. 
Spending without consequence isn’t 
how things work in the real world. It is 
not how things should work in govern-
ment. Congress’s decades of failure to 
think and act responsibly has led to 
enormous 
deficits, 
insurmountable 
debt, and out-of-control spending. 
Right now, our country is spending 
out of control. And even before the 
pandemic, when the economy was 
booming, the Federal Government was 
running trillion-dollar annual deficits. 
This has got to stop. We need real re-
forms. That is why I proposed amend-
ments to the U.S. Constitution requir-
ing a supermajority vote in each House 
of Congress to impose or raise any tax 
or fee and provide line-item veto au-
thority for the President of the United 
States. 
I have also led the charge to set a 
‘‘No Budget, No Pay’’ policy in Federal 
law so that if Congress doesn’t pass a 
budget on time—its most important 
constitutional 
responsibility—Mem-
bers don’t get paid. It is simple. You 
don’t do your job; you don’t get paid. 
During our vote-arama, we voted on 
this, and unfortunately my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle all voted 
against it. 
With America in such desperate need 
of leadership to fix our spending and 
debt problem, you would think that the 
first thing President Biden would do is 
to set a plan and work hard to make 
things right. Well, think again. 
Four weeks after Congress spent $900 
billion to address the economic im-
pacts of COVID, Biden began his Presi-
dency with a call for Congress to spend 
another $1.9 trillion. Then the Demo-
crats passed it by themselves, despite 
the fact that we didn’t know how much 
of the $4.9 trillion stimulus funding al-
ready allocated had been spent. 
Today, 
President 
Biden 
is—soon 
President Biden is going to propose it 
sounds like a $7 trillion budget. It will 
take the United States to its highest 
sustained levels of Federal spending 
since World War II. This is on top of 
the $7.1 trillion in new spending Biden 
has proposed in his first 4 months in of-
fice—$7.1 trillion. You can’t make this 
stuff up. 
I think we are only going to collect 
about $3.5 trillion or so in revenues. 
How can we keep spending money like 
this? No family can do it. No person 
can do it. 
I have been warning about the danger 
of reckless spending for years, and now 
we are seeing it play out in real life. 
President Biden’s liberal dreams of big 
government, big debt, and high taxes 
are no longer speculation. 
Now he is rolling out his plans for 
systemic socialism plainly for all to 
see. He has already proposed $7.1 tril-
lion in spending in just 4 months, and 
now another $6 or $7 trillion of Amer-
ican taxpayer dollars on top of that, all 
while holding back needed funding for 
our military. 
By the way, as we added those 1.7 
million jobs when I was Governor of

May 27, 2021 
Florida, we paid off a third of the State 
debt—over $10 billion—and cut over $10 
billion in taxes. Everything we should 
be doing up here, we did in Florida, and 
we can do it here if we will start look-
ing at how we spend our money. 
Biden wants to redistribute wealth, 
making everyone dependent on govern-
ment while asking our brave men and 
women in uniform to go without. It is 
systemic socialism, and it is already 
hurting American families. 
America is in a nearly $30 trillion 
debt crisis, but that won’t stop Biden’s 
tone-deaf march toward socialism. As 
the President plans to spend our Na-
tion into oblivion, 83 percent of Ameri-
cans are already tightening their budg-
et due to inflation pressures, and 87 
percent of Americans already believe 
that we have significantly overspent 
money, and they know that the Fed-
eral Government’s spending is causing 
their inflation. 
I grew up poor, and I know what it is 
like to watch my family struggle with 
inflation because of failed government 
policies 
and 
reckless 
spending. 
I 
watched my mom struggle to put food 
on the table and watch her as food 
prices went up. She struggled to put 
food on the table, and that is what we 
are doing to families right now all 
across this country. 
Washington can’t spend like this 
anymore. Debt has consequences. Mas-
sive spending has consequences. Tax in-
creases have consequences. It all hurts 
America’s poorest families the most. 
And something else to think about: 
This summer, Congress and President 
Biden will face a critical choice of rais-
ing or suspending the debt ceiling. Con-
gress has made a habit of maxing out 
America’s credit card with no plan to 
pay for it for decades. Failure to rein 
in deficit spending will inevitably 
cause—and it is already happening— 
high inflation, devastating the pur-
chasing power of all Americans, and 
disproportionately impacting low- and 
fixed-income families. 
Since 
the 
Biden 
administration 
doesn’t have a plan to address this cri-
sis, I hope they will join me in fighting 
for fiscal restraint and the adoption of 
sustainable and responsible debt reduc-
tion measures like we did in Florida 
and passage of reforms that produce 
concrete, enforceable limitations of 
deficit spending. 
Americans understand they can’t 
spend without consequences. It is time 
for government to embrace this same 
mentality. We did a poll earlier this 
year—I saw a poll earlier this year—80 
percent of Americans are worried about 
the Federal debt, and they are con-
cerned it is going to lead to financial 
problems for our country. 
We have to scrutinize every bill we 
have, including this bill. Are we spend-
ing this money well? No one has had 
time to read this bill. Too often, law-
makers in Washington pass bills with-
out having time to read them before 
they vote. These are new laws that im-
pact American families and businesses 
and sometimes even authorize billions 
or trillions in tax dollar spending, and 
we don’t have time to read these 
things. It is complete Washington dys-
function. It needs to end. 
This bill is thousands of pages. It 
spends hundreds of billions of dollars. 
Growing up, my family lived paycheck 
to paycheck. My mom and my adopted 
dad struggled, but my mom instilled in 
me the value of counting pennies—a 
value I utilized as a businessman for 
four decades before I thought about 
running for office. I had to make pay-
roll. I had to make sure there was 
money in the bank to make sure every-
body got paid. I had to make sure we 
never ran out of money. First 10 rules 
of business: Don’t run out of money. 
My employees counted on me every 
time to make sure we never ran out of 
money. And if you look at what the 
Federal Government is doing, people 
are scared to death of what is going to 
happen to their Social Security, what 
is going to happen to their Medicare as 
this country racks up unbelievable 
deficits and unbelievable debt. 
When I ran for Governor, I just said: 
We are not going to do this. We are 
going to figure out how we can live 
within our means, and we did it. You 
know, we watched the pennies. As Gov-
ernor, I had a line-item veto, and we 
went through every line every year, 
and, again, if we didn’t get a return, we 
didn’t do it. 
When I took over Florida, it was like 
a failing business. I was worried about 
what it was going to be like for my 
children and my grandchildren in the 
State that I enjoyed living in. I wanted 
to make sure everybody had the same 
opportunity I had. We did it in Florida. 
We turned around the State, and we 
can do the same thing here. 
You know, I was the first Governor in 
20 years who actually paid down debt. 
Actually, for 20 straight years, the 
State of Florida increased its debt over 
$1 billion a year, and we paid off over 
$10 billion in 8 years. 
So we can do it here, but we have got 
to start, with this bill, taking our time 
and looking at it line by line. Do we 
need to spend this money? Do we get a 
return for this money? Is this good for 
our taxpayers? Is this good for the fam-
ilies of our country? And if it is not, we 
have got to stop doing this. 
I want the next generation to have 
the same opportunities I had to live 
their dreams in this country. If we con-
tinue down this path, that opportunity 
is going to be lost. At some point, the 
bill is going to come due. 
You know, Robert Baden-Powell’s fa-
mous plea to ‘‘try and leave this world 
a little better than you found it’’ has 
actually fallen on deaf ears here. We 
are not clearly leaving this country in 
a better shape. You would never do this 
to your kids and grandkids, leave the 
debt that we are leaving our kids and 
our grandkids. 
The Federal Government takes in a 
little over $3 trillion. I think this year 
it is $3.5 trillion and it is spending tril-
lions more. You just can’t keep doing 
that. Right now, the interest alone on 
our nearly $30 trillion national debt is 
over half a trillion dollars a year. That 
is just interest. What are we getting 
for that? We get nothing for that. 
It doesn’t do anything to help with 
our families. It doesn’t help us build 
our military. It doesn’t pay for Social 
Security. It doesn’t pay for Medicare. 
We know Medicare is running out of 
money. What happens when Medicare 
runs out of money? Doctors and hos-
pitals are going to have to be paid sig-
nificantly less or Medicare recipients 
are going to have to get less care. I 
don’t want any Medicare recipient to 
get less care. 
Social Security is running out of its 
cash reserves by 2034. There is an auto-
matic cut in Social Security. That is 
not fair. People who are paying into 
their Social Security plan, they are not 
being told that there is not going to be 
enough money there. 
In this country, Medicaid costs are 
increasing by about 5 percent a year— 
5 percent. I mean, our revenues are not 
growing 5 percent a year. And these 
programs are called mandatory pro-
grams, so we don’t have any control 
over them. I was shocked when I came 
up here that we don’t even look at the 
cost of those programs. We don’t even 
pass a budget with regard to those pro-
grams. I mean, it makes it convenient 
that we don’t have to vote on it, but it 
is not fair to the American taxpayer. 
We see what is happening when debt 
rises. I mean, if you look at what hap-
pens with a company—when a com-
pany, when its debt rises and they 
can’t pay their debt, what happens? 
They go bankrupt. And who gets hurt? 
All the employees who work there, 
they get hurt. Their customers get 
hurt; suppliers gets hurt; and every-
body gets hurt. It is just a fact that is 
what happens. We have to think the 
same way here. We have to think how 
do we reduce the debt, not how do we 
increase the debt. 
Just this week, I held a press con-
ference showing how the Democrats’ 
reckless spending has increased the 
cost of groceries and gasoline. Inflation 
also raises rent; not to mention it 
makes it hard to get a student loan or 
loan to start a business when the inter-
est rate goes up. 
It is just like I mentioned, 83 percent 
of Americans already tighten their 
belt. They are worried, and they know 
that it is caused by what we are doing 
up here. 
I have been shocked that President 
Biden has been completely silent about 
inflation. He has not said a word about 
it. And if you listen to Secretary 
Yellen, all she says is we need to spend 
more money. I mean, they are not 
looking at what is happening with in-
flation. 
Next week, we get the CPI numbers 
and PPI numbers, and we will see what 
they are. But you watch what is hap-
pening to families. The poor families 
and those on fixed incomes are getting 
hurt while all these prices go up.

We have got to stop this. The April 
consumer price index rose by eight- 
tenths of 1 percent. That is almost 10 
percent 
on 
an 
annualized 
basis. 
Annualized basis inflation rate for the 
past 3 months has been 7.2 percent and 
6.2 percent for the first 4 months. 
The core inflation rate, excluding 
food and energy, on an annual basis, 
grows in April by 11 percent—a rate not 
exceeded since June of 1982. While 
these price increases are significant, 
broad, and accelerating, are they tem-
porary effects? We don’t know. We 
don’t know if it is temporary. Some 
people say they are temporary, but 
who knows. But are they going to go 
back down? 
As traditionally understood, infla-
tion is too much money chasing too 
few goods, and where does that money 
come from? It comes from reckless 
Federal spending. While it may seem 
old-fashioned to ask in this brave new 
world of monetary theory, where Joe 
Biden declared last year that ‘‘Milton 
Friedman isn’t running the show any-
more,’’ is there reason to be concerned 
that the broad money supply, M2, grew 
by 24 percent over the last year, a post-
war year high? Never, in the history of 
this country have you seen money sup-
ply grow like that without having sig-
nificant inflation. 
And if you go back to what happened, 
the only way they stopped the signifi-
cant inflation in the past is signifi-
cantly higher interest rates, which 
hurts every family but especially the 
family on a fixed income and the poor 
families because their wages are not 
going to go up like that. 
So 24.6 percent, that is more than 
twice the rate it grew—on inflation, it 
is more than twice the rate it grew be-
fore inflation reached 13.4 percent in 
1979 and almost three times the rate it 
grew amid the guns-and-butter spend-
ing surge during the Vietnam war. 
And what about the extraordinary 
stimulus spending of the past year? 
Larry Summers, the highly respected 
former Treasury Secretary and eco-
nomic adviser to Presidents Obama and 
Clinton, warned that the Biden stim-
ulus would create purchasing power 
‘‘at least three times the size of the 
output shortfall’’ and would be ‘‘the 
least responsible macroeconomic poli-
cies we’ve had in the past 40 years.’’ 
We need only look at the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis comparison of the 
first quarter of 2021 to a year earlier to 
confirm Mr. Summers’ concerns. Wages 
and salaries are already significantly 
larger in the first quarter of 2021 than 
they were before the pandemic. Trans-
fer of payments have almost doubled, 
and personal savings have surged an 
extraordinary $4.1 trillion from $1.6 
trillion a year ago. 
The end of the pandemic isn’t only 
unleashing the pent-up demand of the 
tremendous shutdown economy. It is 
opening the floodgate to a torrent of 
spending fueled by fiscal and monetary 
stimulus not seen since the Civil War. 
When inflation happens, first off, you 
end up with a mindset of inflation. 
Somebody stopped me the other day 
and said: I know car prices are up. 
Should I buy now because car prices 
are going to be up even higher in a 
year? 
With that mentality, that is what 
causes inflation to continue to go up— 
when Americans start believing it is 
going to go up, it is going to keep 
going up even as a result of reckless 
spending. But once they get in that 
mindset, it is very difficult to stop it. 
The U.S. economy clearly has the 
power to iron out the natural problems 
of restarting production, but the very 
nature of the subsidies in the $6 trillion 
Biden administration stimulus relief 
and the infrastructure bills constrain 
production. 
You know, you look at what is hap-
pening with trying to get jobs. There 
are about 8 million job openings in the 
State. A year ago, I was here speaking 
on the Senate floor saying that you 
can’t pay people more not to work than 
to work. I mean, people are going to 
make a logical economic decision, and 
they are going to do the right things 
for their families. 
So now what we are seeing is we have 
job openings all across the country. In 
my State, we have restaurants—we 
have a lot of small businesses that 
can’t find workers. I talked to an indi-
vidual who has a cement company 
today. He couldn’t get truckdrivers. 
What we have done to ourselves makes 
no sense. 
In its modern incarnation, socialism 
denies that government incentives and 
constraints have anything to do with 
people’s decisions to work, save, and 
invest, but we all know that is not 
true. 
These 
Federal 
supplemental 
pay-
ments to unemployment have just 
caused—it has caused a catastrophe for 
our small businesses. 
The 
Congressional 
Budget 
Office 
found that the Affordable Care Act 
would cut the number of hours worked 
by as much as 2 percent. So how can 
expanding ObamaCare in the recent 
stimulus not affect employment? It 
does. The same applies to expansions of 
COBRA, the monthly child credit, and 
other income supports. 
Historically in America, the best 
housing, 
healthcare, 
transportation, 
nutrition, and childcare program was 
always a job—that is what our parents 
always told us—not some government 
program. If you give people things they 
typically get from a job, don’t be sur-
prised when they don’t take the job. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
claims 
that it hasn’t seen evidence that its 
unemployment bonus is keeping people 
from work, but we know that is not 
true. I have talked to people who work 
in the Biden administration. While Joe 
Biden will say that, they acknowledge 
it is not true. With the Labor Depart-
ment reporting record job openings and 
the National Federation of Independent 
Business detailing a record number of 
small businesses offering jobs but find-
ing no takers, that claim is not cred-
ible. 
Since the War on Poverty began, gov-
ernment transfer payments have risen 
to provide more than 90 percent of the 
income of the bottom 20 percent of in-
come-earning households, and the labor 
force participation rate among work- 
age households has collapsed to 36 per-
cent from 68 percent. How is that good 
for those families? 
You get a lot of satisfaction out of 
having a job. We need to have safety 
nets, but we don’t want to put our-
selves in the position that people be-
come dependent on government pay-
ments. 
The Biden administration also asks 
Americans to believe that they can 
raise income, corporate, and death 
taxes, smother the private sector with 
regulations, kill the fossil fuel indus-
try, and fill the regulatory Agencies 
with activists fundamentally hostile to 
the Nation’s economic system, and it is 
not going to have any effect on eco-
nomic performance. We know that is 
not true. 
Back in the real world, much of what 
the President is doing will impede the 
recovery, reduce economic capacity, 
and fuel inflation. And who does it 
hurt? It always hurts the poorest fami-
lies, always hurts the person who is 
struggling to find work, always hurts 
the person on a fixed income. That is 
who gets hurt. 
If Congress sees inflation as a real 
threat, it should stop spending. Unfor-
tunately, right now, Congress doesn’t 
think that way. We can see what is 
happening in the real world. Any unob-
ligated balances in the Biden stimulus 
or previous stimulus bills can no longer 
be justified using current economic cir-
cumstances and should be rescinded, or 
if we are going to spend new money 
with, hopefully, a way to get a return 
on it, we should still spend it with 
unspent stimulus money. 
Rescinding the stimulus authority in 
the Biden stimulus at the end of the 
fiscal year on September 30 would save 
over $700 billion—$700 billion—accord-
ing to the CBO. Rescinding authority 
sooner and including all previous stim-
ulus bills would save us $1 trillion. 
Congress should repeal the enhanced 
unemployment benefits and reinstate 
the Clinton-era work requirements for 
welfare. Work requirements should be 
applied to all unearned benefits to any-
one except the elderly, the disabled, 
and students. 
Congress should adopt a real, en-
forceable budget that funds infrastruc-
ture and the other functions of the gov-
ernment without further expanding the 
deficit and debt. 
The debt ceiling, which expires on 
August 1, should be used to set into 
place a long-term, binding program to 
stop the Federal debt from growing be-
yond 100 percent of gross domestic 
product. If the inflation of the 1970s 
and 1980s has returned, it is the ‘‘Gods 
of the Copybook Headings’’ that have 
returned once again to teach us that

water will wet us, fire will burn, and 
the government can’t give us some-
thing for nothing. 
Debt also has an impact on interest 
rates. As interest rates go up, the in-
terest on the national debt will in-
crease faster and faster. It is going to 
be a debt spiral, and it is going to be 
very hard to deal with. 
We have low interest rates now. If 
you look at the 50-year average of the 
10-year Treasury, it is significantly 
higher than it is now. If that happens, 
it will be very difficult to fund any pro-
gram we care about, whether it is 
Medicare, Social Security, or fund the 
military. When interest rates go up— 
and interest rates historically have al-
ways gone up when you have signifi-
cant deficit spending, when you have 
significant 
inflation—then 
we 
are 
going to have a very difficult time 
funding the programs we care about. 
I hope we don’t end up having a sov-
ereign debt crisis, but we are staring 
right at it right now. 
None of this is to say I don’t have 
hope for our future. I have clear hope 
for it. We can do it. We did it in Flor-
ida. Every time our country is faced 
with a challenge, we have shown our 
ability to rise above it, but if we don’t 
acknowledge it, it doesn’t happen. 
So as long as I am a Member of the 
Senate, I am going to fight to rein in 
the out-of-control spending that is put-
ting our country’s future at risk. I 
have to. I have seven grandkids. I am 
going to do my best to leave this coun-
try in a better position than when I 
started. 
But if you just look at the last 20 
years, at the unbelievable increase in 
debt—I think when Ronald Reagan got 
elected, the national debt was under $1 
trillion, and now it is close to $30 tril-
lion. So we have to get focused on this. 
We can’t just do something like this— 
rush through a bill that nobody has 
had the opportunity to really under-
stand and spend hundreds of billions of 
dollars, not knowing whether we are 
going to get a return. 
So, look, I want to figure out how to 
do good things. When I was Governor, 
we 
invested 
$85 
billion 
in 
roads, 
bridges, airports, and seaports. I be-
lieve in investing. We invested in our 
universities. But we can’t just keep 
spending money like this. 
With that, I think I will yield to my 
colleague. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 1260 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to commend my colleagues for 
the important work that everybody is 
doing down here on the Senate floor, 
bipartisan work, addressing one of the 
most important challenges we have as 
a nation. Not just today but for years 
this challenge is going to be with us, 
and that is the challenge of dealing 
with the rise of the Communist Party 
of China. That is going to be more and 
more of a challenge and focus of the ef-
forts of all elements of America’s econ-
omy, military, society. 
And here is the good news. As you are 
seeing here, there is a lot of focus, a lot 
of effort, and a lot of bipartisan work. 
It is a democracy, a Republic, right? It 
is messy. It is not going to be perfect. 
But, for the Chinese, I think the worst 
nightmare of the Chinese Communist 
Party is to see Americans coming to-
gether and recognizing that this is 
something we all need to work on to-
gether. 
China’s economy is growing. Their 
high-tech capability is growing. Their 
military capability is growing. Their 
aggressiveness throughout the region 
is growing. 
Just look in the last year: Hong 
Kong; the disputes along the China- 
India border with India; the aggressive-
ness toward Taiwan; the economic em-
bargo, in many ways, against our ally 
Australia; Xinjiang Province; the full 
discrimination against the Uighurs. 
And, of course, China is now fully fo-
cused on exporting its authoritarian 
model abroad—not just at home but 
abroad. But again, as I mentioned, the 
good news is that we as a nation, we as 
a Senate, we as a Congress, Repub-
licans and Democrats, are starting to 
awaken to this challenge. 
This is an issue I have been focused 
on since I came to the Senate over 6 
years ago. I think the previous admin-
istration, the Trump administration, 
with their National Security Strategy, 
National Defense Strategy, which said, 
hey, we know we have challenges with 
violent extremists organizations, but 
we need to start shifting our focus to 
great power competition with China as 
the pacing threat—that is where we 
should be focused. 
Those strategy documents—the Na-
tional Defense Strategy, the National 
Security Strategy—these were actually 
quite bipartisan documents, quite bi-
partisan strategies. The National De-
fense Authorization Act, which will be 
taken up here in a couple of months, in 
the last few years has been built 
around this National Defense Strategy, 
focusing on great power competition— 
China, Russia. So that is continuing. It 
is actually continuing on the floor here 
in the U.S. Senate as we speak. 
What I have been trying to do is 
work with Members on both sides of 
the aisle—certainly with the Trump 
administration but also with the Biden 
administration—as they address this 
challenge. I had some good meetings 
with a number of senior officials in the 
administration, and one takeaway I 
got from discussing these issues with 
the National Security Advisor, Jake 
Sullivan, was a comment he had made 
about how when we were looking at our 
challenges with China, we need to 
think about these in the way in which 
Dean Acheson, who was a very famous 
Secretary of State, talked about the 
beginning of the Cold War with the So-
viet Union in the late 1940s; how Amer-
ica needs to be dealing with the Soviet 
Union and that Cold War from situa-
tions of strength, positions of strength. 
I thought that was a really insightful 
comment by the current National Se-
curity Advisor. 
So I want to mention a few of these 
because we have a lot of them relative 
to China. Our comparative advantages, 
in my view, are much greater than 
theirs in this competition that is going 
to, in my view, last for decades. So let 
me name a few of these situations of 
strength. 
First, our allies. The United States is 
an ally-rich nation. China is an ally- 
poor nation and getting poorer by the 
day, by the way. Maybe North Korea is 
one ally. Maybe Russia sometimes, but 
I don’t really buy it. So that is a huge 
comparative advantage that we have as 
a nation, and we need to look at our 
system, our network of allies and deep-
en them and expand them. 
One area that that has happened with 
regard to our allies, really is a corner-
stone of our alliance system in Asia, is 
the continued focus on what is called 
the Quad. The Quad is three of the big-
gest economies and democracies in the 
whole world: the United States, Japan, 
India, and Australia. 
The Quad actually began in terms of 
a focus of strategy in the George W. 
Bush administration. The Trump ad-
ministration highlighted it even more. 
To the Biden administration’s credit, 
they took the Minister-level meetings 
that were the focus of the Trump ad-
ministration’s effort with the Quad and 
took it to the leader level. President 
Biden met with the leaders—India, 
Japan, 
Australia, 
and 
the 
United 
States—recently. It is a very impor-
tant development. The Quad can help 
anchor our alliances in the Asia-Pa-
cific and beyond in a very significant 
way. The Chinese are constantly talk-
ing about it because they don’t like it 
because they know what it signifies. 
So that is one area of strength, situa-
tion of strength that I think all of us 
can agree on, and I think Members of 
this body can certainly help play a 
role. 
As we look to head into a work ses-
sion, I am going to head to the Asia- 
Pacific with some of my Senate col-
leagues 
here—Senator 
DUCKWORTH, 
Senator COONS, and maybe a few oth-
ers—and we are going to help build on 
this important comparative advantage 
that we have as a nation—allies. We 
are an ally-rich nation. China is ally- 
poor. The more aggressive they are act-
ing in the region, the more this situa-
tion of strength is going to play to our 
advantage. 
Let me give you another situation of 
strength for the United States, particu-
larly as it relates to China. It is a huge

position of strength. It is our energy 
sector, the all-above energy sector for 
America—I mean renewables, oil, nat-
ural gas. This is an area that for dec-
ades we have tried to become energy 
independent. We have tried to return to 
the status we had during World War II, 
which was the world’s energy super-
power in terms of the production of en-
ergy. 
The good news on that is we have re-
turned to that. Prior to the pandemic, 
the United States had once again be-
come the world’s energy superpower—a 
lot of people thought we could never 
achieve that again, but we have—the 
largest producer of natural gas in the 
world, bigger than Russia; largest pro-
ducer of oil in the world, bigger than 
Saudi Arabia; largest producer of re-
newables in the world. This is really 
good for our economy. It is really good 
for jobs. It is really good for our na-
tional security and foreign policy. And 
yes, it is really good for our environ-
ment. 
Why is that? I know some people 
don’t like the production of energy in 
America, but here is a fact: We need 
energy, ‘‘all of the above’’ energy. My 
State has it all, all the things that I 
just mentioned—oil, gas, renewables. 
We have an enormous abundance in 
Alaska. 
But here is the other fact: We pro-
duced these energy opportunities, we 
produced this energy in America with a 
higher environmental standard than 
any other place on the planet. That is 
a fact. That is a fact. So if we need en-
ergy, which we do, ‘‘all of the above’’ 
energy, which we do, we need to make 
sure we are producing it in a place with 
the highest standards, in a place that 
will employ American people workers. 
By the way, energy jobs are great jobs. 
Here is one other thing. You look at 
the intel. You talk to people who know 
the region. The Communist Party in 
China recognizes this comparative ad-
vantage, and it scares the living day-
light out of them because they are very 
energy dependent, and we have lit-
erally become, through the hard work 
and ingenuity of so many in our great 
Nation, energy independent. 
By the way, not only has this helped 
our environment, it has helped with re-
gard to greenhouse gas emissions. 
From 2005 to 2017, the United States re-
duced its greenhouse gas emissions by 
almost 15 percent—15 percent. You 
don’t hear that often, but it is a fact— 
more than any other industrialized na-
tion in the world. 
China was going like this. Still is. By 
the way, right now, the latest numbers 
on greenhouse gas emissions—China is 
producing 
more 
than 
the 
United 
States, the EU, and India combined. 
That is also a fact. 
So we have reduced global green-
house 
gas 
emissions 
dramatically. 
Why? We all know why. It was the rev-
olution and the production of Amer-
ican natural gas. That is a fact. That is 
a fact. 
So if we want to grow our economy, 
have an enormous comparative advan-
tage relative to China and adversaries 
like Russia, produce more good-paying 
jobs, protect our environment, and en-
hance our national security and foreign 
policy, continuing the production of 
‘‘all of the above’’ energy, which we are 
going to need for decades, is something 
that we should be doing. 
Now, some in the Biden administra-
tion understand this. Others don’t and 
want to restrict production of Amer-
ican energy, and when those people 
speak, guys like John Kerry, the lead-
ers in China and Russia are smiling. 
They are smiling. 
Fortunately, this legislation here, 
the Endless Frontier Act, is focused on 
outcompeting the Chinese, all of us 
coming together and outcompeting 
them in many different areas—artifi-
cial intelligence, quantum computing, 
and, yes, energy as well. 
Specifically, what is in the bill is 
called advanced energy and industrial 
efficiency technologies, advanced en-
ergy technologies. That is in the legis-
lation. 
Again, I think it is here because we 
recognize what a critical, comparative 
advantage we have relative to China in 
this sector, so we want to take advan-
tage of it. It is in the legislation. 
Advanced energy technology is not 
defined in this bill, but that is because 
the Congress has been abundantly clear 
on what this means. In my discussions 
with Senators and, more importantly, 
what the Congress has passed a number 
of times, advanced energy technology 
means what it states in the definition 
of a law unanimously passed in the 
Senate and in the House just two Con-
gresses ago, 42 USC 18632. It actually 
has the definition of advanced energy 
technology, which is what is the focus 
of this bill, the Endless Frontier Act. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that 42 USC 18632 be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
42 U.S.C. 18632: ENERGY INNOVATION HUBS

be conducted. 
(Pub. L. 115–246, title II, §206, Sept. 28, 2018, 
132 Stat. 3137.) 
Mr. SULLIVAN. The definition of ad-
vanced energy technology, which is in 
the bill, the Endless Frontier Act, and 
is defined in 42 USC 18632 is along the 
following lines. It says ‘‘Definitions,’’ 
‘‘advanced energy technology’’ means 
an ‘‘innovative technology that pro-
duces energy from solar, wind, geo-
thermal, biomass, tidal, wave, ocean, 
or other renewable energy.’’ 
That is important for our country. It 
goes on to say ‘‘that produces nuclear 
energy’’—that is important for our 
country—‘‘for carbon capture and se-
questration.’’ Again, a critical com-
parative advantage. ‘‘That enables ad-
vanced vehicles, vehicle components,

and related technologies that result in 
significant energy savings.’’ Again, im-
portant. 
And it also says ‘‘that enhances the 
energy independence and security of 
the United States by enabling im-
proved or expanded supply and produc-
tion of domestic energy resources, in-
cluding coal, oil, and natural gas.’’ 
That is in the definition of advanced 
energy technologies, and that is the 
definition that was passed two Con-
gresses ago, unanimously, and that is 
why it has not been defined here be-
cause it has already been defined in 
this. 
Congress is very clear on what ad-
vanced energy technology means in the 
Endless Frontier Act. That is a huge 
comparative advantage, as I men-
tioned, oil, gas, renewables. And that is 
an important element of this legisla-
tion in our competition with China, 
and I am glad that is recognized. 
One final area of what, again, the 
current administration’s National Se-
curity Advisor called a situation of 
strength relative to China, and that, of 
course, is our military. To be honest, 
this is where I am worried. 
The second term of the Obama-Biden 
administration cut defense spending by 
25 percent. That is actually one of the 
reasons I ran for the Senate. I never 
ran for anything, but what I saw what 
was happening to the U.S. military—an 
institution I love and I served in for 
over 25 years—that was enough motiva-
tion for me to say I need to help do 
something. The readiness of our forces 
during that era, the second term of the 
Obama-Biden 
administration—the 
readiness of our forces plummeted— 
plummeted. And our adversaries in 
Moscow and Beijing watched this and 
were gleeful. 
We can talk about AI and everything 
else that we are talking about in this 
bill, but if we are gutting our military, 
that is one of the worst things we can 
do with regard to sending a message to 
China about our seriousness. I worry. 
Last year on this floor—last sum-
mer—we had a big debate in the NDAA 
over defense spending. The majority 
leader—who was then the minority 
leader—and the Senator from Vermont, 
Senator 
SANDERS, 
put 
forward 
an 
amendment they called—no kidding— 
‘‘defund the Pentagon’’ then. That was 
the name of their amendment, with 14 
percent across-the-board cuts to the 
entire U.S. military. My response was: 
There they go again. There they go 
again. 
Well, now that they regained power, 
it looks like this movie is coming to a 
theater near us again, and it is not 
going to be nice. Tomorrow, the Biden 
administration’s budget is going to be 
coming out. The numbers that we are 
anticipating are about a 16-percent in-
crease in domestic spending and a real 
decrease in military spending—infla-
tion-adjusted 
decrease 
in 
military 
spending again. Beijing will be watch-
ing this and will be gleeful. 
When Republicans were in the White 
House and the Senate majority just re-
cently, we were respectful of our col-
leagues in the minority, and there was 
an agreement essentially about a one- 
for-one, domestic programs increasing 
and the military budget is going to in-
crease by about the same amount. That 
is what we all agreed on here. That is 
what we worked on here. Now, it looks 
like it is going to be 16-for-1 or maybe 
even worse. This is something we real-
ly need to focus on. 
Make no mistake, we can talk about 
supply chains, intellectual property, 
competitiveness, which is what we are 
talking about here with this legisla-
tion. These are all important topics. 
But all the policy changes that we are 
debating here right now are not going 
to amount to much in our overall com-
petition with respect to China if we 
lose our military edge with respect to 
China. 
Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
my 
col-
leagues just don’t recognize that or 
don’t want to recognize that. Soft 
power isn’t much good without hard 
power to back it up. We learned that 
lesson before. It has been a painful les-
son, if you look at our history. 
But the Chinese Communist Party 
certainly appears to understand this. 
According to one watchdog, it has in-
creased its military investments by 76 
percent over the last decade, and we 
are going to put out a budget tomorrow 
with an inflation-adjusted decrease in 
our military spending, despite the run-
away domestic spending proposed by 
this administration. That is worri-
some, and that is not operating from a 
position of strength with regard to the 
Chinese Communist Party. We need to 
watch out for that one. I am very con-
cerned. 
Yes, there is a lot of bipartisan work 
going on in the Senate, but if the lead-
ership on the Senate floor and the 
House leadership as well and the Biden 
administration work together to cut 
defense spending, that is going to be 
one of the worst things we can do for 
our long-term competition with regard 
to China. 
As we are focused on these challenges 
with the rise of China, let me conclude 
by predicting that not only is this 
challenge going to be with us for dec-
ades, but how we need to address it. I 
have talked about some of these situa-
tions of strength. We must face this 
challenge with confidence and stra-
tegic resolve. 
As I have noted and I just talked 
about a few, America has extraor-
dinary advantages relative to China: 
our global network of alliances, our 
military power, and economic leader-
ship, our innovative society, our abun-
dant and innovative energy supplies, 
advanced energy technology as defined 
in this bill and other bills, the world’s 
most 
productive 
workforce, 
and 
a 
democratic value system. 
Yes, it can be messy, but that makes 
countries around the world, and par-
ticularly in the INDOPACOM region, 
far more comfortable as American 
partners and allies than as subservient 
members of a New Middle Kingdom led 
by China. As a result of the long twi-
light struggle with the Soviet Union, 
we also know what works: maintaining 
peace through strength, promoting free 
markets and free people at home, and 
having 
the 
confidence 
in 
George 
Kennan’s insights when he set forth the 
strategy of containment in the late for-
ties to deal with the Soviet Union— 
that the Chinese Communist Party, 
like the Soviet Communist Party, like-
ly bears within it the seeds of its own 
decay. While democracies are resilient, 
adaptive, and self-renewing, there are 
many vulnerabilities embedded in Chi-
nese’s perceived strength. 
One-man rule creates acute political 
risks. Historical grievance can bring 
violent 
nationalism. 
State-directed 
economic growth can produce massive 
overcapacity and mountains of debt, 
and the gradual snuffing out of freedom 
that we are literally seeing daily in 
places like Hong Kong sends fear 
throughout the entire region. 
China’s budding military power and 
historical view of itself as a natural 
and cultural superior to many others is 
beginning to alarm neighboring states, 
inspiring them to want to step up secu-
rity 
cooperation 
with 
the 
United 
States, not with China. Nearly half of 
wealthy Chinese want to emigrate. Re-
member, these are the winners from 
China’s four decades of heady economic 
growth. 
As we have in the past, we can pre-
vail in this geopolitical and ideological 
contest, but doing so will require a new 
level of strategic initiative, organiza-
tion, and confidence in who we are as a 
people and what we stand for. This also 
means that we must redouble our ef-
forts in making this strategic case to 
others around the world, particularly 
our allies. This kind of work here—al-
though it can be messy, although it 
can be difficult, although it can be 
challenging—is part of the process we 
need to put together to compete. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

MORNING BUSINESS 
S. 1260 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, in 
a bipartisan vote, the Senate advanced 
important legislation to increase our 
Nation’s competitiveness with China. 
The United States Innovation and 
Competition Act, USICA, of 2021 is sig-
nificant legislation and an example of 
what process and debate can yield in 
the U.S. Senate. 
This legislative package is the end 
result of the bipartisan work of from

May 27, 2021 
multiple Senate committees and re-
flects the urgency of addressing the 
challenges faced by domestic manufac-
turers and American researchers in our 
global competition with China. This in-
cludes an emergency appropriation of 
$54 billion in funding for grants to 
make semiconductor chips here in 
America and for the continuation of 
chip production in Essex, VT. The 
package also allocates $1.5 billion in 
funding for implementation and domes-
tic research and development, R&D of 
5G technology to ensure that the 
United States drives the modernization 
of its own communications infrastruc-
ture. 
The bill significantly raises author-
ization levels by almost $120 billion 
over 5 years for the National Science 
Foundation, NSF, the National Aero-
nautics 
and 
Space 
Administration, 
NASA, the Department of Commerce, 
and the Department of Energy, DOE. 
These historic investments in Amer-
ican ingenuity will help strengthen our 
country’s R&D capabilities, regional 
economic development opportunities, 
manufacturing capacity, and supply 
chain resiliency. 
Through the creation of a new Direc-
torate of Technology and Innovation at 
the NSF, the Federal Government will 
be able to better support research and 
technology development in key focus 
areas, such as the growing artificial in-
telligence space and quantum science. 
Among other activities, the Direc-
torate will help fund R&D at collabo-
rative institutes, establish technology 
testbeds, and award scholarships and 
fellowships 
to 
build 
a 
workforce 
equipped to lead us through the 21st 
century and beyond. 
Throughout the process, I was en-
couraged to see a strong focus on the 
need to continue to increase education, 
research, and workforce opportunities 
in 
rural 
and 
underserved 
areas 
throughout the country. The regional 
technology hub program at the Com-
merce Department established in this 
bill will benefit rural communities in 
Vermont and across the country. These 
hubs, of which there will be three per 
EDA region, will carry out workforce 
development activities and business 
and entrepreneur development activi-
ties, among other important activities. 
I appreciate the work done by fellow 
Members in the Senate to ensure that 
these hubs truly and accurately rep-
resent the significant economic needs 
of rural areas in this country. 
The inclusion of increased supple-
mentary funding for research at uni-
versities that participate in the Estab-
lished Program to Stimulate Competi-
tive Research, EPSCoR, takes impor-
tant steps to build our Nation’s capac-
ity in the science, technology, engi-
neering, 
and 
mathematics, 
STEM, 
field. This funding will also help reduce 
the geographic concentration of re-
search and development and education 
opportunities across the country. For 
far too long, Americans have had to 
leave their hometowns and even their 
home States to get an education and 
find work. This bill will give rural resi-
dents more reasons to stay close to 
home and help their communities grow 
from the ground up. I have seen the in-
credible work that has already been 
done by the University of Vermont’s 
participation in EPSCoR and am ex-
cited to see what is to come from this 
substantial investment. 
This 
serious 
legislative 
package 
shows what can be done when we all 
work together in the Senate. Thanks 
to these efforts, we will be able to se-
cure America’s role as a global leader 
in technology, R&D, and manufac-
turing. I hope the House of Representa-
tives will soon consider this legislation 
so President Biden can sign this his-
toric initiative into law. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the 
Senate prepares to vote on the U.S. In-
novation and Competition Act, I want-
ed to take moment to highlight the 
support this bill provides to the U.S. 
semiconductor industry. I want to 
commend the leadership that Senators 
WARNER, CORNYN, and SCHUMER have 
shown in highlighting the need for our 
country to ensure that we maintain 
leading edge manufacture capabilities 
in the United States. I strongly sup-
port the over $50 billion provided in 
this bill for the Department of Com-
merce to join in partnerships with U.S. 
semiconductor companies. 
My history with microelectronics 
spans my career in the Senate, and I 
can remember when Tom Watson se-
lected Essex Junction as the location 
for an IBM fab to produce some of the 
first generations of mass produced in-
tegrated circuit memory and proc-
essing chips. Of course, it revolution-
ized 
computing. 
Over 
the 
years, 
Vermonters working out of Essex led 
the way in inventing new kinds of 
chips and new ways to make chips, at 
the same time making Vermont the 
State with the most patents per capita. 
Over that time, I heard again and 
again from national security leaders 
from both political parties that one of 
the biggest threats facing the United 
States was that our revolutionary 
technology was threatened by the pro-
duction of chips increasingly moving to 
foreign countries. While some of those 
countries closely cooperate with the 
United States, being offshore provides 
an inherent risk of the chips being 
compromised by malicious actors or 
even facilities themselves being ren-
dered inoperable, one way or another. 
I helped create a program called 
Trusted Foundry within the Depart-
ment of Defense to provide critical 
chips for national security needs that 
we knew were untampered with from 
start to finish and were made right in 
the United States. Because the na-
tional security needs alone could never 
be produced at an economically prac-
tical scale, we located Trusted Foundry 
in commercial fabs, including the one 
in Essex. Today that factory still pro-
duces both commercial and national 
security chips, particularly chips used 
for radio frequency or RF functions. 
With this bill, we continue the en-
deavor to produce chips in the United 
States at a commercially viable level. 
We hope that the production can sup-
ply our national security needs, by geo-
graphically keeping production domes-
tic, thereby increasing our confidence 
that the chips have not been tampered 
with. 
Through the Appropriations Com-
mittee, I will continue oversight of this 
important area. We will ensure that 
these grants are administered well and 
build toward a better future. And we 
will ensure they are part of a whole-of- 
government effort, including contribu-
tions from the Department of Defense 
and other Agencies from their own au-
thorizations and budgets. Thanks to 
this bill, I look forward to a brighter, 
and more technologically capable fu-
ture. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1813 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am dis-
appointed that my bipartisan amend-
ment with Senators MORAN and MUR-
KOWSKI is not receiving a vote today. 
Our amendment has a simple pur-
pose—to protect taxpayers. It seeks to 
do so by providing the administration 
the discretionary authority to nego-
tiate for warrants, which are like stock 
options, as part of the $50 billion we 
are appropriating in this bill for the 
CHIPS for America Fund. 
A warrant is the right to purchase 
one share of common stock at a 
preestablished price, known as the 
strike price. Warrants, just like stock 
options, are exercised when the stock 
price is greater than the strike price. 
The idea is that if taxpayer dollars are 
necessary to invest in a company, then 
taxpayers should also benefit from 
some of the upside when the company 
grows. 
I worked on a bipartisan basis to se-
cure warrants when Federal funds were 
needed for private companies as part of 
the Troubled Asset Relief Program, 
TARP, and in the CARES Act. As a re-
sult of the warrants provision in 
TARP, nearly $10 billion in profit was 
generated for taxpayers. And according 
to new Department of Treasury esti-
mates, taxpayers stand to gain more 
than $1 billion for the CARES Act war-
rants. 
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, 
who also has prior private sector expe-
rience as a venture capital investor and 
as a former treasurer of Rhode Island, 
said this week at a CJS Appropriations 
Subcommittee hearing that she would 
‘‘support’’ having this authority as a 
‘‘good way to stick up for American 
taxpayers.’’ 
So if companies are receiving tax-
payer funds to make investments in 
semiconductors, U.S. taxpayers should 
also be able to get some of the upside 
when these investments pay off. We 
should be striving to ensure that we 
get the best possible deal for our con-
stituents’ money. 
I appreciate Leader SCHUMER’s com-
mitment to get this concept included 
in the bill as it moves forward in the

process, and I will continue working 
with him and all of our colleagues to 
make that commitment a reality. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Budg-
et Control Act of 2011 expires this year, 
and that is a good thing. 
This law led to a decade of under-
funding our domestic priorities, from 
which it will take years to recover. 
Right now, in communities across the 
country, our infrastructure is crum-
bling, millions of Americans cannot ac-
cess Federal programs for which they 
qualify, and we are falling behind in in-
vesting in science, research, and devel-
opment on the global economic stage— 
all of this because the Budget Control 
Act set artificial and unrealistically 
low caps on discretionary spending, 
and it inflicted arbitrary, across-the- 
board spending cuts known as seques-
tration. 
President Biden understands the real 
consequences of this decade-old deci-
sion. That is why tomorrow, President 
Biden will propose a 16-percent in-
crease for nondefense investments in 
his budget. We cannot build back bet-
ter until we recover the ground we 
have already lost. 
I want to give a few examples of what 
I mean. For many low-income families 
with young children, the beginning of 
summer means the end of school break-
fast and lunch programs and waking up 
every morning dreading how you will 
be able to put food on the table for 
your children. Basic nutrition is a 
basic requirement for child health, de-
velopment, and education. 
The Summer EBT program is meant 
to help these families bridge to this 
gap, with an extra $30 or $60 per child 
every month. This is a program that 
has proven itself successful, reducing 
the number of households with food-in-
secure children from 43 percent to just 
under 35 percent. But because of the 
Budget Control Act, this program has 
been flat-funded. We could not expand 
upon its success. And today, only 16 
percent of children who need access to 
USDA food programs have that access. 
This problem of underinvestment in 
successful, 
worthwhile 
programs 
is 
true across our appropriations bills. 
Our country, which has led in some 
of the greatest scientific discoveries of 
the last century, ranks 24th out of 36 
developed nations for investments in 
university research and development as 
a share of GDP. 
We once accounted for 69 percent of 
global research and development ex-
penditures but have fallen to just 
under 30 percent. China now accounts 
for 23.9 percent of global research and 
development spending, and growing. 
How did this happen? One analysis by 
the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science directly at-
tributes $200 billion in lost Federal re-
search and development investments to 
the Budget Control Act. The National 
Science Foundation alone has lost $2 
billion a year, which could support 
more than 5,500 grants and 65,000 sci-
entists, technicians, and students. 
We cannot lead in a rapidly evolving 
technological landscape unless we are 
investing in science and our scientists. 
Failing to do so only cedes the next 
great discovery to China at the cost of 
innovation here in the United States. 
As chair of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, I am committed to fighting for 
the investments in American science, 
research, medical progress, and techno-
logical development that our great Na-
tion needs and deserves. 
There has been a lot of talk in this 
Chamber about the need for a major in-
frastructure package to repair our Na-
tion’s crumbling bridges and roads, and 
I support addressing that need. But 
there is a reason why our roads are in 
disrepair, forcing the American people 
to spend nearly $130 billion each year 
on vehicle repairs and operating costs. 
There is a reason why our drinking 
water systems lose the equivalent of 
9,000 Olympic-size swimming pools of 
water every day. And there is a reason 
why one in five children lacks the high- 
speed internet connections they need 
to learn and participate in school. 
That reason is a decade of budget 
caps that artificially constrained our 
ability to address these issues before 
they became the national limitation 
and 
embarrassment 
that 
they 
are 
today. 
Now there is a $44 billion backlog in 
airport improvement projects, $35 bil-
lion in deferred maintenance for public 
housing, and $472.6 billion in urgently 
needed funds to maintain and improve 
the Nation’s drinking water infrastruc-
ture. 
Over the last decade, we have lost 
ground in education, childcare, envi-
ronmental protections, and affordable 
housing. The Budget Control Act did 
not constrain our national debt; it left 
us as a nation in disrepair. 
Joe Biden understands this, and I 
commend him for taking the bold ac-
tion to address this in the budget he 
will release tomorrow. As chairman of 
the Senate Appropriations Committee, 
I look forward to working with the 
President, his administration, and my 
dear friend Vice Chairman SHELBY on 
passing responsible appropriations bills 
that address the damage caused by the 
Budget Control Act. 
The end of the Budget Control Act 
gives us the opportunity to invest in 
our communities. Tomorrow, Congress 
will receive the President’s budget. The 
full Appropriations Committee has al-
ready held hearings on the need to in-
vest in our infrastructure and on the 
threat of domestic violent extremism, 
and in June, we will hold hearings on 
global leadership and national secu-
rity. In June, our subcommittees will 
hold numerous hearings to scrutinize 
the President’s budget. 
When Congress returns in early June, 
it is essential that Congress, on a bi-
partisan and bicameral basis, work 
with the President to negotiate budget 
toplines so that we can commence the 
appropriations process for the fiscal 
year that begins October 1. As Presi-
dent Biden has said, we can, should, 
and need to build back better.

TRIBUTE TO THERESA 
ALBERGHINI DIPALMA 
∑ Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is 
no State in America more beautiful 
than Vermont, but along with its jaw- 
dropping beauty, Vermont is home to 
some of the finest, most active and en-
gaged citizens who make it such a spe-
cial place. 
Theresa Alberghini DiPalma is one of 
those people. Theresa recently let it be 
known that she will be leaving her sen-
ior 
position 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Vermont Health Network. 
I have known Theresa and her late 
parents for more than 30 years. The-
resa’s parents were both public school 
teachers. They raised five children in 
Burlington, including Theresa. Her fa-
ther Roy saw Active Duty as a lead 
navigator on bombers in the European 
theater in World War II. Her mother 
Connie was also a pillar of the commu-
nity. She taught Spanish, and she was 
an accomplished musician and extraor-
dinary cook. 
Theresa grew up in Burlington, the 
youngest of those five kids and the 
only girl. After college, she started in 
my 
Washington 
office 
answering 
phones. She steadily climbed the pro-
fessional ladder to be both my top 
healthcare adviser and then my legisla-
tive director. 
For as long as I have been in the Sen-
ate, I have talked about the challenge 
of keeping, maintaining, and attract-
ing young Vermonters to our State. 
More than 20 years ago, Theresa did 
just that. In the mid-nineties, Theresa 
returned to Vermont to be closer to 
family and to serve as Vermont’s chief 
healthcare regulator. 
After leaving government service, 
Theresa 
joined 
the 
University 
of 
Vermont College of Medicine in 2000, 
serving as assistant dean for external 
relations. In 2002, she was called to 
serve—first on a temporary basis and 
then 
permanently—at 
then-Fletcher 
Allen Health Care during a time of 
great challenge. 
Theresa joined a dedicated team, led 
by Ed Colodny, which worked tirelessly 
to restore public trust in our State’s 
academic medical center. 
Theresa is a now a senior vice presi-
dent for external relations at the Uni-
versity of Vermont Health Network, 
where she and her colleagues support 
and lead an integrated healthcare de-
livery system in Vermont and New 
York, dedicated to ensuring that the 
more than 1 million people in the re-
gion have access to the care they need, 
close to home. 
Theresa’s commitment to the well- 
being of our communities is boundless. 
She has served on several boards, in-
cluding Mercy Connections, the United 
Way of Northwest Vermont, the Lake 
Champlain 
Chamber, 
the 
Vermont 
Chamber of Commerce, VELCO, VGS, 
Vermont 
Business

She is deeply committed to the pro-
fessional advancement of women in our 
area and routinely mentors young pro-
fessionals. 
She and her husband Robert reside in 
Burlington. Marcelle and I think of 
their home on Maple Street as our sec-
ond home. While I know one incredible 
chapter is closing for Theresa, I also 
know that she hasn’t lost her passion 
for making Vermont a better place. I 
so look forward to seeing what is 
ahead.∑

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise in support of the legislation to cre-
ate an independent, bipartisan Com-
mission to examine the January 6 at-
tack on the Capitol that killed five 
people. 
A full and honest review is critical 
not only to understand the events of 
that day but also to ensure the contin-
ued strength and well-being of our de-
mocracy. 
On the afternoon of January 6, Amer-
icans watched in horror as thousands 
of insurrectionists stormed the Capitol 
to prevent the certification of a free 
and fair Presidential election. 
Many of us carry vivid memories 
from that nightmarish day. We recall 
the panic and confusion, the shouting 
and chants of an angry mob, and the 
crashing of windows and doors being 
smashed inside these hallowed halls. 
While many of us were on the Senate 
floor until being evacuated to a secure 
location by the Capitol Police and Ser-
geant at Arms, we have learned since 
that violent members of the mob were 
minutes away from reaching the Sen-
ate Chamber with us inside. 
Capitol Police officers, upholding 
their sworn duty to protect and defend 
the Capitol and Members of Congress, 
were beaten with sticks, bats, and even 
the American flag as the mob charged 
the building. 
Rioters broke into this very Cham-
ber, dropping down from the Gallery, 
some carrying zip ties presumably to 
restrain any Senators or police officers 
they caught. Others were chanting 
‘‘hang Mike Pence’’ while a makeshift 
gallows was built outside the Capitol 
Building. 
While these memories remain clear, I 
fear the record for January 6 is being 
blurred by misinformation and polit-
ical posturing. 
An independent, bipartisan commis-
sion is our best chance to set the 
record straight and establish the truth 
about the events on January 6. 
Congressional committees, the De-
partment of Justice, and President 
Trump’s impeachment trial have con-
ducted their own reviews of the vio-
lence on that day and some of the 
events leading up to it. However, those 
reviews weren’t comprehensive and 
didn’t have the stature of a congres-
sionally mandated, independent, and 
bipartisan Commission, along the lines 
of the 9/11 Commission. 
In addition to providing an inde-
pendent and authoritative account of 
the January 6 attack, the Commission 
would evaluate the motivation for and 
planning of the attack, identify gaps in 
law enforcement preparation and re-
sponse, and enable Congress and the 
administration to take action to pre-
vent future attacks. 
I would remind Senators that the 
same arguments being used against 
this Commission were used against 
forming the 9/11 Commission. ‘‘Reviews 
are already underway. It will become 
political. We need to look forward, not 
backward.’’ But the 9/11 Commission 
revealed 
critical 
new 
information 
about the planning and implementa-
tion of that attack and made rec-
ommendations that led to landmark 
legislation. It is now the model of an 
independent Commission, and the leg-
islation before us today is based on 
that model. 
I call upon every one of my col-
leagues to support this serious, com-
prehensive, and bipartisan review of 
the violent attack on the Capitol. 
We owe it to the American people to 
pass this legislation and establish an 
independent Commission. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this bill.

This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
The proposed sale improves Australia’s ca-
pability to meet current and future threats 
by providing timely Intelligence, Surveil-
lance, and Reconnaissance (1SR), target ac-
quisition, locate submarine capabilities, and 
counter-land and counter-surface sea capa-
bilities for its security and defense. This sale 
will enhance interoperability between the 
U.S. Air Force and the Royal Australian Air 
Force (RAAF). Australia has demonstrated a 
commitment to modernizing its military and 
will have no difficulty absorbing this equip-
ment into its armed forces. 
The principal contractors will be General 
Atomic Aeronautical Systems Inc., San 
Diego, CA; Lockheed Martin Inc., Bethesda, 
MD; Raytheon Inc., Waltham MA; and 
Leonardo SpA, Rome, Italy. The purchaser 
typically requests offsets. Any offset agree-
ment will be defined in negotiations between 
the purchaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Australia. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MQ–9B Remotely Piloted Aircraft 
(RPA) is a weapons-ready aircraft designed 
for 
Medium-Altitude 
Long-Endurance 
(MALE) Intelligence, Surveillance and Re-
connaissance (ISR), Target Acquisition, and 
Strike Missions. The MQ–9B RPA is not a 
U.S. Air Force program of record but has 
close ties to, and builds upon, the proven 
success of the MQ–9A Reaper. The MQ–9B is 
a highly modular, easily configurable air-
craft that contains the necessary hard 
points, power, and data connections to ac-
commodate a variety of payloads and muni-
tions to meet multiple missions, including 
counter-land, 
counter-sea, 
and 
antisub-
marine strike operations. The system is de-
signed to be controlled by two operators 
within a Certifiable Ground Control Station 
(CGCS). The CGCS is designed to emulate a 
reconnaissance aircraft cockpit, giving users 
extensive means to operate both the aircraft 
and sensors. The MQ–9B is able to operate 
using a direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) datalink 
or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) through sat-
ellite communications (SATCOM). The MQ– 
9B system can be deployed from a single site 
that supports launch/recovery, mission con-
trol, and maintenance. The system also sup-
ports remote-split operations where launch/ 
recovery and maintenance occur at a For-
ward Operating Base (FOB) and mission con-
trol is conducted from another location or 
Main Operating Base (MOB). 
2. The Raytheon Multi-Spectral Targeting 
Systems-D (MTS-D) EO/IR sensors is a 
multispectral Targeting System with Laser 
Target 
Designator 
(LTD). 
A 
multi-use 
Electro Optical (EO)/infrared (IR) sensor pro-
vides long-range surveillance, high-altitude 
target acquisition, tracking, range-finding, 
and laser designation for all tri-service and 
NATO laser-guided munitions, with capabili-
ties up to and including high definition color 
TV, high definition short-wave IR, medium- 
wave IR, and long-wave IR sensors. The AN/ 
DAS–4 is an evolutionary upgrade to the cur-
rent AN/DAS-I system. 
3. The Lynx AN/APY–8 Synthetic Aperture 
Radars (SAR) with Ground Moving Target 
Indicator (GTMI) System provides all-weath-
er surveillance, tracking, and targeting for 
military and commercial customers from 
manned and unmanned vehicles. 
4. The L3 Harris RIOTM Communications 
Intelligence System incorporates radio re-
ceivers and flexible digital processing to cre-
ate the ability to intercept, location, and 
copy adversary communications. The system 
is flexible enough that it can detect a wide 
variety of types of communications. The 
open design allows the system to be up-
graded with new software features as adver-
sary communications change. 
5. The Honeywell TPE–331–10–GD Turbo-
prop Engine is used in a variety of airborne 
platforms, including the MQ–9B. 
6. The Ground Control Station (GCS) can 
be either fixed or mobile. The fixed GCS is 
enclosed in a customer-specified shelter. It 
incorporates workstations that allow opera-
tors to control and monitor the aircraft, as 
well as record and exploit downlinked pay-
load data. The mobile GCS allows operators 
to perform the same functions and is con-
tained on a mobile trailer. Workstations in 
either GCS can be tailored to meet customer 
requirements. 
7. The Embedded GPS-INS (EGI) with Se-
lective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module 
(SAASM) is a self-contained navigation sys-
tem that provides the following: accelera-
tion, velocity, position, attitude, platform 
azimuth, magnetic and true heading, alti-
tude, body angular rates, time tags, and co-
ordinated universal time (UTC) synchronized 
time. SAASM enables the GPS receiver ac-
cess to the encrypted P(Y) signal providing 
protection against active spoofing attacks. 
8. Leonardo SeaSpray Maritime Multi-Role 
Patrol Radar is a synthetic aperture X-band 
radar that provides small-target maritime 
detection in high seas, maritime search (in-
cluding submarine periscopes and semi- 
submersibles), radar imaging of ocean tar-
gets, and weather detection and avoidance. 
9. The SAGE 750 Electronic Surveillance 
Measures (ESM) System is a United Kingdom 
produced 
digital 
electronic 
intelligence 
(ELINT) sensor that analyzes the electro-
magnetic spectrum to map the source of ac-
tive emissions. Using highly accurate Direc-
tion Finding (DF) antennas, SAGE builds 
target locations and provides situational 
awareness, advance warning of threats, and 
the ability to cue other sensors. 
10. The C-Band Line-of-Sight (LOS) Ground 
Data Terminals and Ku-Band SATCOM GA- 
ASI Transportable Earth Stations (GATES) 
provide command, control, and data acquisi-
tion for the MQ–9B. 
11. The ARC–210 UHF/VHF secure radio is a 
voice communications radio system that can 
operate in either normal, secure, and/or jam- 
resistant modes. 
12. The KOR–24A Small Tactical Terminal 
Link–16 is a command, control communica-
tions, and intelligence (C3I) system incor-
porating high-capacity, jam-resistant, dig-
ital communication links for exchange of

near real-time tactical information, includ-
ing both data and voice, among air, ground, 
and sea elements. 
13. The AN/DPX–7 is an Identification 
Friend or Foe (IFF) Transponder used to 
identify and track aircraft, ships, and some 
ground forces to reduce friendly fire inci-
dents. 
14. The KY–100M is a lightweight terminal 
for secure voice and data communications. 
The KY–100M provides wideband/narrowband 
half-duplex communication. Operating in 
tactical ground, marine and airborne appli-
cations, the KY–100M enables secure commu-
nication with a broad range of radio and sat-
ellite equipment. 
15. The KIV–77 Mode 5 crypto applique 
computer for IFF is Type 1 certified by the 
National Security Agency and provides in-
formation assurance for both legacy Mode 4 
and new Mode 5 IFF equipment. The KIV–77 
is used to store the classified keys. 
16. The AN/APQ–10C Simple Key Loader is 
a handheld fill device for securely receiving, 
storing, and transferring data between cryp-
tographic and communications equipment. 
17. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions 
(JDAM) is a guidance set that converts exist-
ing unguided bombs (MK–82, MK–83, MK–84, 
BLU–109, BLU–110, BLU–111, BLU–117, BLU– 
126 (Navy) or BLU–129 warhead) into an accu-
rate, adverse weather ‘‘smart’’ munition. 
The Guidance Set consists of a Tail Kit, 
which contains the Inertial Navigation Sys-
tem (INS) and a Global Positioning System 
(GPS), and a set of Aerosurfaces and an um-
bilical Cover, which allows the JDAM to im-
prove the accuracy of unguided, general pur-
pose bombs. The Guidance Set, when com-
bined with a warhead and appropriate fuse, 
forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU). The 
JDAM weapon can be delivered from modest 
standoff ranges at high or low altitudes 
against a variety of land and surface targets 
during the day or night. After release, JDAM 
autonomously guides to a target, using the 
resident GPS-aided INS guidance system. 
The JDAM is capable of receiving target co-
ordinates via preplanned mission data from 
the delivery aircraft, by onboard aircraft 
sensors (i.e., FUR, Radar, etc.) during cap-
tive carry, or from a third-party source via 
manual or automated aircrew cockpit entry. 
The KMU–572 is the guidance set for a 
GBU–38 (500-pound bomb body) JDAM Tail 
Kit. 
18. The Laser JDAM (GBU–54) is a 500- 
pound JDAM that incorporates all the capa-
bilities of the JDAM guidance kit and adds a 
precision laser guidance set. The Guidance 
Set consists of a Tail Kit, which contains the 
Inertial Navigation System (INS) and a 
Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, a 
set of Aerosurfaces and an umbilical cover, 
which allows the JDAM to improve the accu-
racy of unguided, general purpose bombs. 
The Laser JDAM (LJDAM) adds the DSU–38/ 
40 sensor, which gives the system a semi-ac-
tive laser seeker. This allows the weapon to 
strike targets moving at up to 70 mph. 
19. GBU–12/58 Paveway II (PW–II) 500-pound 
(GBU–12) and 250-pound (GBU–58) are maneu-
verable, free-fall, laser-guided bombs (LGBs) 
that guides to reflected laser energy from 
the desired target. Employment of the LGB 
is the same as a normal general purpose (GP) 
warhead, except the semi-active guidance 
corrects for employment errors inherent in 
any delivery system. Laser designation for 
the weapon can be provided by a variety of 
laser target markers or designators from the 
air or ground. The Paveway system consists 
of a laser guidance kit, a computer control 
group (CCG), a warhead-specific Air Foil 
Group (AFG) that attach to the nose and tail 
of MK–81 and MK–82 General Purpose (GP) 
bombs, and a fuse. The weapon is primarily 
used for precision bombing against non-hard-
ened targets. 
a. The MAU–169 or the MAU–209 are the 
CCG for the GBU–12 and GBU–58. 
b. The MXU–650 is the AFG for the 500- 
pound GBU–12. 
c. MXU–1006/B is the AFG for the 250-pound 
GBU–58. 
20. MK–82 Inert General Purpose (GP) bomb 
is a 500-pound, free-fall, unguided, low-drag 
inert weapon used for integration testing. 
There is no explosive fill. 
21. MK–81 Inert GP bomb is a 250-pound 
inert training ordnance representative in 
size and weight of an explosive filled bomb to 
simulate either a free-fall 250-pound bomb or 
precision guided munition. 
22. The Joint Programmable Fuse (JPF) 
FMU–139 is a multi-delay, multi-arm and 
proximity sensor compatible with general 
purpose blast, frag, and hardened-target pen-
etrator weapons. The JPF settings are cock-
pit selectable in flight when used numerous 
precision-guided weapons. It can interface 
with numerous weapons including GBU–12, 
GBU–58, GBU–54, and GBU–38. 
23. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
24. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
25. A determination has been made that 
the Government of Australia can provide 
substantially the same degree of protection 
for the sensitive technology being released 
as the U.S. Government. This sale is nec-
essary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign pol-
icy and national security objectives outlined 
in the Policy Justification. 
26. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of Australia.

tions, Modification Work Orders/Engineering 
Change Proposals (MWO/ECPs), U.S. Govern-
ment and contractor technical and logistics 
assistance, quality assurance teams, trans-
portation services, program management, 
New Equipment Training (NET); and other 
related elements of logistical and program 
support. The total estimated value is $1.685 
billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
The proposed sale improves Australia’s ca-
pability to meet current and future threats 
by enhancing the lethality, survivability, 
and interoperability of the Australian Army. 
Australia will use the enhanced capability to 
strengthen its homeland defense and deter 
regional threats. The MlA2 SEPv3 Main Bat-
tle Tanks will upgrade the current Aus-
tralian fleet of MlAl SA tanks with no 
changes 
to 
Royal 
Australian 
Armoured 
Corps force structure. Additional M88A2 ve-
hicles provide de-processing and combat ve-
hicle recovery support for the Australian 
tank fleet. The M1150 Assault Breacher Vehi-
cles (ABVs) and M1074 Joint Assault Bridges 
(JABs) will be a new capability for the Royal 
Australian Engineers, bringing under-armor 
bridging and breaching capability, increas-
ing the effectiveness and survivability of 
Australian Combat Engineers and providing 
increased mobility for the armored fleet. 
Australia will have no difficulty absorbing 
this equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be General 
Dynamics Land Systems, Sterling Heights, 
MI; BAE Systems, York, PA; Leonardo DRS, 
Arlington, VA; and Honeywell Aerospace, 
Phoenix, AZ. The purchaser typically re-
quests offsets. Any offset agreement will be 
defined in negotiations between the pur-
chaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this sale will require 
the assignment of approximately 10 addi-
tional U.S. or contractor representatives to 
Australia. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. M1A2 System Enhancement Package 3 
(SEPv3) 
Main 
Battle 
Tank. 
The 
M1A2 
Abrams is a third-generation American main 
battle tank, produced by General Dynamics 
Land Systems. The M1A2 SEPv3 features in-
clude a multi-fuel turbine engine, composite 
armor, an advanced computer fire control 
system, separate ammunition storage in a 
blow-out compartment, and 120mm main 
gun. Extensive improvements have been im-
plemented to the latest M1A2 SEPv3 configu-
ration. These include improved digital sys-
tems, increased electrical power margin to 
support demands of future technologies, line 
replaceable modules (LRM) to reduce oper-
ational support costs, ammunition data link 
to support new tank main gun rounds, and 
an auxiliary power unit (APU). The M1A2 
Thermal Imaging System (TIS) and M1A2 
Commander’s Independent Thermal Viewer 
(CITV) constitute the system’s target acqui-
sition system, which, when operated with 
other tank systems gives the tank crew a 
substantial battlefield advantage. The TIS 
provides the M1A2 crew with the ability to 
effectively aim and fire the tank main arma-
ment system under a broad range of adverse 
battlefield conditions. The TIS can be oper-
ated and viewed by the tank gunner or tank 
commander, and is the main sighting system 
for the tanks’ main gun (cannon.) The CITV 
provides the same target acquisition system 
as the TIS, but provides the tank com-
mander a separate system that can be con-
trolled and operated independent of the TIS. 
Australia has commissioned the develop-
ment and production of bespoke Turret 
Front armor to be used in their M1A2SEPv3. 
This armor is being developed by the USG in 
consultation and coordination with the CoA 
to ensure that it is optimized to their per-
ceived threat matrix. 
2. The Abrams 120mm main gun system is 
composed of a 120 millimeter smoothbore 
gun manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal. 
Gun production and design technology are 
generally well known. 
3. The use of a gas turbine propulsion sys-
tem in the M1A2 is a unique application of 
armored vehicle power pack technology. The 
hardware is composed of the AGT–1500 en-
gine and transmission, and while the system 
is not a critical military technology the 
manufacturing processes associated with the 
turbine blades, recuperator, bearings and 
shafts, and hydrostatic pump and motor are 
proprietary 
and 
therefore 
commercially 
competition sensitive. 
4. The Common Remotely Operated Weap-
on Station—Low Profile (CROWS–LP) is the 
M1A2 commander’s weapon station, and al-
lows for under-armor operation of the weap-
ons on the system including the M2HB, 
M2A1, M240B and M240 machine guns. The 
CROWS–LP is an updated version of the 
M153A2 CROWS, is approximately 10 inches 
shorter, and offers increased visibility to the 
user. The fire control system of the CROWS– 
LP allows for ‘‘first-burst’’ on target capa-
bility from stationary and moving platforms. 
The CROWS–LP ingratiates a day camera 
(VIM–C), thermal camera (TIM 1500) and 
laser range finder (STORM/STORM–PI). 
5. The Driver Vision Enhancer—Abrams 
(DVE–A) and Rear View Sensor System 
(RVSS) are un-cooled thermal imaging sys-
tems developed for use while driving combat 
vehicles and tactical wheeled vehicles. The 
DVE–A provides night vision capability for 
the Abrams tank driver. RVSS provides a 
rear view camera for the Abrams tank. DVE– 
A and RVSS allow for tactical vehicle move-
ment in support of operational missions in 
all environmental conditions (day/night and 
all weather) and provides enhanced driving 
capability during limited visibility condi-
tions. 
6. M88A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Vehi-
cle. M88A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Com-
bat Utility Lifting Extraction System (HER-
CULES) Combat Recovery Vehicle is to ex-
tricate combat vehicles that have become 
bogged down or entangled, and to repair or 
replace damaged parts in fighting vehicles 
while under fire. The 70–ton M88A2 Recovery 
Combat Vehicle is standard equipment to de- 
process, recover, and sustain the Abrams Ml 
Tank. 
7. The M88A2’s AVDS–1790–8CR is a unique 
modification to the standard piston engine 
family in the M60 series and the base M88Al. 
Manufacturing processes associated with the 
production of turbochargers, fuel injection 
system, and cylinders are proprietary and 
therefore commercially competition sen-
sitive. 
8. The Driver’s Vision Enhancer—Combat 
Vehicle M88 is an un-cooled thermal imaging 
system developed for use on combat and tac-
tical wheeled vehicles. It allows for tactical 
vehicle movement in all environmental and 
limited visibility conditions. The DVE–CV 
for M88 vehicle is a platform-mounted night 
vision device that requires external power 
supply and is integrated into the vehicle. 
The M88 is also equipped with CROWS–LP 
(M153A2E1), described above for the Abrams. 
9. The Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV). 
The ABV is a highly mobile and heavily ar-
mored 
minefield 
and 
complex 
obstacle 
breaching system. It consists of an M1 
Abrams tank hull, a unique turret with two 
Linear Demolition Charge Systems ( employ-
ing two Mine Clearing Line Charges (MCLC) 
and rockets), a Lane Marking System (LMS), 
Integrated Vision System, and a High Lift 
Adapter that interchangeably mounts mine 
plows, rollers, and dozer blades. 
10. The Driver Vision Enhancer. Abrams 
(DVE–A) and Assault Breacher Vehicle Inte-
grated Vision System (IVS) are un-cooled 
thermal imaging systems developed for use 
while driving combat vehicles and tactical 
wheeled vehicles. The DVE–A provides night 
vision capability for the ABV tank driver. 
IVS provides a rear view camera for the 
ABV. The ABV is equipped with the AGT 1500 
Gas Turbine Propulsion System and the 
CROWS–LP described in the Abrams and 
M88A2 sections above. 
11. The ABV is equipped with a Magnetic 
Signature Duplicator which mounts to the 
forward engineering attachments. It gen-
erates a magnetic perturbation which causes 
magnetically fused mines to detonate well 
forward of the vehicle through the use of an 
emitted magnetic field. 
12. The Joint Assault Bridge (JAB) pro-
vides Army Engineer units supporting Ar-
mored Brigade Combat Teams with a surviv-
able, deployable and sustainable heavy-as-
sault bridging capability. The JAB provides 
a gap-crossing capability to cross wet or dry 
gaps to provide freedom of maneuver on the 
battlefield and keep pace with Abrams Bri-
gade Combat Team operations. The JAB con-
sists of an M1A2 Abrams tank hull inte-
grated with a hydraulic bridge launcher sys-
tem 
to 
deploy 
the 
Armored 
Vehicle 
Launched Bridge (AVLB) Military Load 
Class 95 Scissor Bridge. The JAB is equipped 
with the Driver Vision Enhancer—Abrams 
and the Rear View Sensor Systems described 
above.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Greece—FMSO II, CLSSA Services. 
The Government of Greece has requested 
to buy U.S. Government, technical, and lo-
gistics support services and requisitions sup-
porting the Foreign Military Sales Order II 
(FMSO II) and Cooperative Logistics Supply 
Support Arrangement (CLSSA) for stock re-
plenishment, supply of standard spare parts, 
and repair/replace of spare parts to support 
the Hellenic Air Force’s defensive and trans-
port aerial fleets; all other aircraft systems 
and subsystems; and other related elements 
of program support. The estimated total cost 
is $165 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by helping to improve the 
security of a NATO ally, which is an impor-
tant partner for political stability and eco-
nomic progress in Europe. 
The proposed sale will improve Greece’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by providing agile logistics support 
to active Foreign Military Sales support 
cases, 
including 
Greece’s 
defensive 
and 
transport aerial fleets, as well as other sup-
port equipment of U.S. origin that are cur-
rently in use with the Hellenic Air Force and 
which can be supported by the CLSSA pro-
gram. The ability to place blanket order req-
uisitions will increase its interoperability 
with NA TO forces and enhance its ability to 
provide for the security of its borders. 
Greece has demonstrated a continued com-
mitment to modernizing its military and 
will have no difficulty absorbing this equip-
ment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of these services will not 
alter the basic military balance in the re-
gion. 
There are no principal contractors for this 
proposed sale. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives outside the United States. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
India—P–8I and Associated Support 
The Government of India has requested to 
buy six (6) P–8I Patrol aircraft; eight (8) 
Multifunctional 
Information 
Distribution 
System-Joint Tactical Radio Systems 5 
(MIDS–JTRS 5) (6 installed, 2 spares); forty- 
two (42) AN/AAR–54 Missile Warning Sensors 
(36 installed, 6 spares); and fourteen (14) LN– 
251 with Embedded Global Positioning Sys-
tems (GPS)/Inertial Navigations Systems 
(EGIs) (12 installed, 2 spares). Also included 
are CFM56–7 commercial engines; Tactical 
Open Mission Software (ITOMS) variant for 
P–8I; Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) 
MX–20HD; AN/AAQ–2(V)l Acoustic System; 
ARES–1000 commercial variant Electronic

ing Receiver; AN/ALE–47 Counter Measures 
Dispensing System; support equipment and 
spares; 
publications; 
repair 
and 
return; 
transportation; aircraft ferry; training; U.S. 
Government and contractor engineering, 
software, technical, and logistics support 
services; and other related elements of 
logistical and program support. The total es-
timated program cost is $2.42 billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to strengthen the U.S.-In-
dian strategic relationship and to improve 
the security of a major defensive partner, 
which continues to be an important force for 
political stability, peace, and economic 
progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia 
region. 
The Indian Navy procured eight P–8I air-
craft from Boeing in January 2009, via Direct 
Commercial Sale and contracted for an addi-
tional four aircraft in July 2016. The first P– 
8I aircraft were delivered to the Indian Navy 
in 2013, providing interoperability and crit-
ical capabilities to coalition maritime oper-
ations. This proposed sale of an additional 
six P–8I aircraft will allow the Indian Navy 
to expand its maritime surveillance aircraft 
(MSA) capability for the next 30 years. India 
will have no difficulty absorbing these air-
craft into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor will be The Boeing 
Company, Seattle, WA. The purchaser typi-
cally requests offsets. Any offset agreement 
will be defined in negotiations between the 
purchaser and the prime contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require approximately four (4) contractor 
personnel to support the program execution 
in-country. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The P–8I is the Indian variant of the P– 
8A developed by Boeing, and it was initially 
sold commercially to the Government of 
India in 2009. The P–8I contains a number of 
unique mission systems from both Indian 
and other non-U.S. suppliers to meet Indian 
Navy requirements. The P–8A aircraft is a 
militarized version of the Boeing 737–800 
Next Generation (NG) commercial aircraft. 
The P–8A replaced the P–3C as the Navy’s 
long-range Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW); 
Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW); and Intel-
ligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance 
(ISR) aircraft. P–8I mission systems include: 
a. 
Tactical 
Open 
Mission 
Software 
(ITOMS) variant for P–8I. ITOMS functions 
include environment planning, tactical aids, 
weapons planning aids, and data correlation. 
ITOMS includes an algorithm for track fu-
sion which automatically correlates tracks 
produced by on board and off board sensors. 
b. Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) 
MX–20HD. The EO/IR system processes visi-
ble EO and IR spectrum to detect and image 
objects. 
c. AN/AAQ–2(V)l Acoustic System. The 
Acoustic sensor system is integrated within 
the mission system as the primary sensor or 
the aircraft ASW missions. The Acoustic 
sensor system is integrated within the mis-
sion system as the primary sensor for the 
aircraft ASW missions consisting of an 
Ultra-Flightline Receiver, Ultra-Flightline 
Electronics 
Positioning 
System, 
Boeing 
Acoustics Processor and a L–3 Comm Data 
Recorder. The system has 64 sonobuoy proc-
essing capability. 
d. ARES–1000 Electronic Support Measures 
(ESM). This is a commercial system which 
provides real time capability for the auto-
matic detection, location, measurement, and 
analysis of RF-signals and modes. Real time 
results are compared with a library of known 
emitters to perform emitter classification. It 
does not contain U.S. specific emitter identi-
fication technologies nor is it capable of 
using U.S. libraries or parametric data. 
e. 
Electronic 
Warfare 
Self 
Protection 
(EWSP). The P–8I aircraft EWSP consists of 
the ALQ–213 Electronic Warfare Management 
System (EWMS), AN/AAR–54 Missile Warn-
ing Sensors, AN/ALE–47 Countermeasures 
Dispensing System (CMDS), and AN/APR– 
39D RADAR Warning Receiver. The EWSP 
includes threat information. 
f. Multifunctional Information Distribu-
tion System-Joint Tactical Radio System 5 
(MIDS–JTRS 5) is an advanced Link–16 Com-
mand, Control, Communications, and Intel-
ligence (C3I) system incorporating high-ca-
pacity, jam-resistant, digital communication 
links for exchange of near real-time tactical 
information, including both data and voice, 
among air, ground, and sea elements. 
g. The LN–251 with Embedded Global Posi-
tioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigations 
Systems (EGIs) is a sensor that combines 
Global Positioning System (GPS) and iner-
tial sensor inputs to provide accurate loca-
tion information for navigation and tar-
geting. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures which might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
India can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of India.

Canada—AEGIS Combat System. 
The Government of Canada has requested 
to buy four (4) Shipsets of the AEGIS Com-
bat System (ACS); one (1) AEGIS Combat 
System Computer Program; four (4) Shipsets 
of AN/SPY–7 Solid State Radar Components;

ing combat system capabilities and limita-
tions); training devices and services; tech-
nical support; and other related elements of 
logistical and program support. The esti-
mated total cost is $1.7 billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by helping to improve the 
military capability of Canada, a NATO ally 
that is an important force for ensuring polit-
ical stability and economic progress, and a 
contributor to military, peacekeeping and 
humanitarian operations around the world. 
This proposed sale will increase Canadian 
maritime forces’ interoperability with the 
United States and other allied forces, as well 
as their ability to contribute to missions of 
mutual interest by delivering the first 
AEGIS-capable Canadian Surface Combatant 
ships. This will significantly improve net-
work-centric warfare capability for the U.S. 
forces operating globally alongside Canada. 
Canada will have no difficulty absorbing this 
equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin 
Rotary

Systems, 
Moorestown, NJ. There are a significant 
number of other companies under contract 
with the U.S. Navy that will provide compo-
nents, systems, and engineering services dur-
ing the execution of this effort. While the 
purchaser typically requests offsets, any off-
set agreement will be defined in future nego-
tiations between the purchaser and the con-
tractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require multiple trips by U.S. Government 
representatives and the assignment of con-
tractor representatives to Canada on an 
intermittent basis over the life of the case to 
support delivery and integration of items 
and to provide supply support management, 
inventory control and equipment famil-
iarization. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have 
been down here a lot talking about why 
we need to increase the defense budget: 
We face more threats than ever before. 
China and Russia are investing more in 
modernizing their militaries than ever 
before. We need to strengthen our alli-
ances to discourage our adversaries 
from acting, and the best way to back 
up our friends is with a strong mili-
tary. 
These are all good reasons, but we 
have 2.2 million other reasons we need 
to increase our defense budget: all the 
brave men and women who serve our 
country in uniform. 
May is Military Appreciation Month, 
and I could talk all day about all the 
ways our servicemembers are the best 
in the world and how much I appreciate 
them. But we shouldn’t just talk about 
it; we need to show these brave men 
and women just what they mean to us. 
When I travel, I always eat in the 
mess halls with our troops—not the of-
ficers, the enlisted men and women. 
When I do that, I get a real sense of 
what our troops need to do their jobs 
and defend this country. So I have a 
pretty good idea of what will show 
them our appreciation. We should show 
them by providing adequate, consistent 
and stable funding on time. 
When budgets are delayed and de-
fense spending is cut, you know who 
feels it the most? Our troops. It hurts 
their morale. It hurts their readiness. 
It hurts their families. It affects every-
thing. 
We should show them with more and 
better training that focuses on their 
safety. We should show them by giving 
them modem weapons and equipment 
that work and work well. We should 
show them by taking care of their fam-
ilies, making sure their spouses have 
good employment opportunities, their 
kids 
have 
access 
to 
high-quality 
childcare and education, and they all 
have the best healthcare. We should 
show them by giving them high-quality 
housing. 
Over the last 2 years, this was my 
priority, and it will be this year too. 
Senator REED also understands this sa-
cred duty we have. 
The last two years, we have given our 
troops a pay raise of 3 percent or 
more—some of the largest annual pay 
raises ever. We increased hazardous 
duty pay by 10 percent last year; that 
is what we give our troops in the most 
dangerous jobs. We have made changes 
to fix the broken housing system be-
cause no servicemember should ever be 
living in bad housing. We are con-
tinuing to keep an eye on this until all 
the necessary fixes are in place, includ-
ing the Housing Bill of Rights we are 
waiting for. We have helped make sure 
military spouses have good jobs, even 
when they move. We have focused on 
building a modern healthcare system 
that works for our servicemembers and 
their families, and we have prioritized 
mental healthcare for those who serve. 
I am proud we have been able to do all 
this. 
But here is the thing: Taking care of 
our troops—that is at least a third of 
our defense budget right there. That is 
the 
right 
thing 
to 
do. 
Our 
servicemembers are the backbone of 
our national security. It’s also the nec-
essary thing to do for our All-Volun-
teer Force. No one is forced to enlist 
anymore. The military needs to com-
pete for our country’s best and bright-
est, and that takes money. 
The troops lay everything on the line 
to defend our Nation. They sacrifice 
time with their families and friends. As 
we remember each year on Memorial 
Day, many make the ultimate sac-
rifice. There aren’t enough words to ex-
press our gratitude. That is why we 
have to show them. 
But the math of President Biden’s 
budget doesn’t add up when it comes to 
taking care of our troops. Not when we 
have to do all these other things—de-
fend against more than one serious 
threat, support our allies and partners, 
and take on new domains. We can do 
things to make things more cost-effec-
tive for the taxpayer, but we can’t go 
back on our promises to those who 
agreed to serve. They are all volun-
teers, after all. 
So it concerns me when people talk 
about us spending more than China, 
Russia, and other countries—it is just 
not true. 
One of the reasons our defense budget 
is large is because we take care of our 
people. China and Russia—they don’t 
do that. They give them a gun and tell 
them to fight. No one else takes care of 
their people the way we do. That is 
why they don’t have the caliber of peo-
ple we do. Our military personnel are 
the best in the world. 
So yes, a strong military budget is 
about sending a message to our en-
emies. It is about sending a message to 
our allies and partners. But it is also 
about sending a message to our troops: 
that we are going to take care of you 
and your families while you serve. We 
are going to make sure you have what 
you need to defend this country—the 
equipment, the training, the personnel, 
the weapons, the support. 
President Biden’s budget equals a cut 
to national defense. While we are going 
to prioritize taking care of our troops 
they are going to feel that cut some-
how, someway, no matter what we do. 
We are asking them to do more with 
less, and we have been asking them for 
decades now. 
There are things President Biden and 
I agree we need to do when it comes to 
our national defense—keep the Indo- 
Pacific open and free, enhance our 
cyber defense, innovate and modernize, 
and beyond. But President Biden’s got 
more on his list of things he wants to 
ask our military to do—stuff that real-
ly falls outside the core mission of the 
Department of Defense—and he is not 
even giving them more budget to do it 
with. This is not a message we should 
send our troops. It is not what they de-
serve. 
One month for military apprecia-
tion—it is really not enough. But we 
can show our troops our appreciation 
year-round by giving them the budget 
they need, a budget with real growth to 
match the strategy they are carrying 
out.

ASIAN/PACIFIC AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today, in recognition of Asian Pacific 
American Heritage Month. Every year 
throughout the month of May, the peo-
ple of the United States come together 
to celebrate the contributions of gen-
erations of Asian Americans, Native 
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, AA 
NH/PI, who have enriched our society 
and whose legacies are deeply inter-
twined in our Nation’s history. 
The 
AA 
NH/PI 
communities 
are 
among the fastest growing and most di-
verse demographic groups in our coun-
try. Today, approximately 23 million 
people of AA NH/PI descent live in the 
United States, representing more than 
45 ethnicities and speaking more than 
100 languages. As AA NH/PI commu-
nities increase their social and polit-
ical presence in our country, we must 
work to raise the visibility of issues 
important to AA NH/PIs. One way to do

May 27, 2021 
this is to uplift the diverse voices of 
our communities through representa-
tion. This year, there are a record 21 
AA NH/PI Members serving in Con-
gress, and we celebrate the historic 
election of KAMALA HARRIS to be the 
first woman and the first Asian Amer-
ican to hold the Office of the Vice 
President. However, even with today’s 
progress, our AA NH/PI communities 
continue to face issues of disparity and 
prejudice. 
This year, we once again commemo-
rate Asian Pacific American Heritage 
Month amid a global pandemic. While 
the pandemic has claimed the lives of 
more than half a million Americans, 
COVID–19 has had an outsized impact 
on communities of color, including Pa-
cific Islanders, who are three times 
more likely to contract COVID–19 and 
are nearly twice as likely to die from 
the disease. The pandemic has also ex-
posed and exacerbated social and eco-
nomic 
disparities 
in 
our 
country. 
Throughout the pandemic, Pacific Is-
landers and other vulnerable groups 
have been disproportionately impacted 
by unemployment, food and income in-
security, and unstable or inadequate 
housing, among other hardships. This 
pandemic has highlighted the work we 
must do to ensure that all Americans, 
especially 
individuals 
from 
marginalized communities, have access 
to quality healthcare, fair pay, work-
place protections, and other civil and 
human rights. 
Violence and discrimination against 
Asian Americans have also surged dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. Between 
March 2020 and March 2021, Stop AAPI 
Hate received over 6,600 reports of dis-
crimination and hate incidents across 
all 50 States and the District of Colum-
bia. These unprovoked, random attacks 
can happen anywhere—on public trans-
portation, on sidewalks, in businesses, 
and even in the workplace. 
The dramatic rise in hate crimes tar-
geting Asian Americans might be a re-
cent development, but we all know 
that racism has never been far beneath 
the surface in our country. Part of hon-
oring the rich history of the AA NH/Pl 
community includes reflecting on some 
of the darker moments in our Nation’s 
past. AA NH/PIs have always been tar-
geted as the ‘‘other’’ in our country 
and have been treated as the perpetual 
‘‘foreigner.’’ Since the first Asian im-
migrants came to our country nearly 
two centuries ago, our communities 
have experienced race-based prejudice 
and have been subject to discrimina-
tory policies that impinged on individ-
uals’ civil rights, improperly rescinded 
wartime promises, and excluded immi-
grants from Asian countries out of in-
tolerance and fear. 
Recognizing the recent increase of 
hate 
crimes, 
Representative 
Grace 
Meng and I introduced legislation to 
focus attention on hate crimes com-
mitted during the pandemic. Last 
week, President Biden signed this bill, 
the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, into 
law. This action sent a clear message 
of solidarity to our AA NH/PI commu-
nities at a crucial moment. This bipar-
tisan legislation will help Federal, 
State, and local governments confront 
hate in our country and help victims of 
hate crimes to come forward. 
Today, AA NH/PIs are uniting to con-
front this epidemic of racism, discrimi-
nation, and hate. We are marching, 
speaking out, and demanding action in 
cities and states across the Nation to 
ensure that our country does not re-
peat the mistakes of the past. Rep-
resentation and visibility are some of 
the ways we are making our voices 
heard. However, we must also sustain 
efforts to teach empathy and educate 
others about our history. We can help 
to create a more just and equitable so-
ciety by raising awareness of past in-
justices and current issues of impor-
tance to our communities. 
As we celebrate the contributions of 
AA NH/PIs, there is also clear evidence 
demonstrating how much work re-
mains to be done. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues beyond 
the month of May, Asian Pacific Amer-
ican Heritage Month, to continue the 
work that must be done to advance 
civil rights and equal treatment for all.

DRINKING 
WATER 
AND 
WASTE-
WATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to voice my strong support for the 
recent passage of S. 914, the Drinking 
Water and Wastewater Infrastructure 
Act of 2021. I believe it is a vital invest-
ment in the current and future health 
of all our communities, and I applaud 
my Senate colleagues for helping to 
get this done. 
Ensuring access to clean water is es-
sential—and one of the most basic du-
ties of government. Every American 
deserves 
safe 
drinking 
water 
and 
wastewater treatment systems, and in 
my home State of Maryland, these sys-
tems are vital both to the health of our 
fellow citizens and to the health of our 
rivers and our beloved Chesapeake Bay. 
This bill will help pull our waterways 
into the 21st century by providing a 
critical boost in water systems invest-
ments to restore aging infrastructure, 
fund 
cutting-edge 
waterway 
tech-
nology, create resiliency in the face of 
climate change, and create new jobs. 
And critically, this legislation was de-
signed 
with 
equity 
in 
mind, 
so 
marginalized communities can benefit 
from this big leap forward. This has 
been a longstanding bipartisan pri-
ority, and I am pleased that colleagues 
from both sides of the aisle have come 
together to pass this vital legislation 
through the U.S. Senate. 
Now, it is up to our colleagues in the 
House to pass this bill too so we can 
get it to the President’s desk. And 
should he sign it into law, as I believe 
he will, I will be doing my part as a 
member of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee to ensure we fully fund this 
initiative. 
I thank my colleagues for joining me 
and a bipartisan group of Senators in 
supporting this key investment in our 
Nation’s water infrastructure.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO RANDY GORDON 
∑ Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, today 
I would like to congratulate Randall 
‘‘Randy’’ C. Gordon on his retirement 
from the National Grain and Feed As-
sociation, NGFA, after nearly 43 years 
of service. 
A native Nebraskan, Randy grad-
uated from the University of Nebraska- 
Lincoln, UNL, with undergraduate de-
grees in journalism, history, and polit-
ical 
science. 
After 
college, 
Randy 
worked at UNL’s Agricultural Commu-
nications Department and freelanced 
for the Omaha World-Herald. 
Randy’s NGFA story began on July 1, 
1978, when he was hired as the director 
of information services. In 1987, he was 
promoted as NGFA’s vice president for 
communications and government rela-
tions. A voracious reader and writer, in 
1996, Randy authored a history of the 
first 100 years of the NGFA for its cen-
tennial celebration, entitled ‘‘A Cen-
tury 
of 
Agricultural 
Abundance 
Through Free Enterprise.’’ In 2005, the 
Food and Drug Administration award-
ed Randy for his contributions to pre-
venting 
the 
spread 
of 
bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, in 
the United States. In 2012, Randy be-
came president and CEO of NGFA. 
Through more than four decades of 
NGFA service, Randy has made count-
less contributions to the U.S. agricul-
tural industry. 
As the senior senator from Nebraska, 
I congratulate Randy on a successful 
and impactful career representing cru-
cial aspects of the agricultural value 
chain. Randy, I wish you, your wife 
Barbara, and your children and grand-
children good health as you enter re-
tirement. You have done Nebraska

as 
the 
100-year

of 
two 
Kiwanis members, ND, constituents, 
Mr. Lynn Aas and Mr. John Sinn. 
Since its founding on May 27, 1921, 
the Kiwanis Club of Minot has helped 
make my home town a better place to 
live. As a former member of this orga-
nization, I deeply appreciate their con-
tinued dedication and contributions to 
the community and surrounding area. 
Some examples of their work include 
donating books to schools, supporting 
the arts, and raising money for local 
service organizations, like the Boy 
Scouts and the Juvenile Drug Court 
and Domestic Violence Crisis Center. 
In these ways, Minot’s local Kiwanis

chapter helps realize the mission of 
this international organization and 
makes a real difference to families and 
children in the region. 
At the same time, two notable 
Kiwanis members, Mr. Lynn Aas and 
Mr. John Sinn, are celebrating their 
100th birthdays this year. As part of 
the ‘‘greatest generation’’ and as World 
War II veterans, Lynn and John have 
both been an important part of the 
Minot community and set a great ex-
ample for their fellow Kiwanis mem-
bers. 
A native of McLean County, ND, 
Lynn Aas fought as a rifleman in the 
historic Battle of the Bulge. He served 
with the 17th Airborne Division of the 
193rd Airborne Infantry and received 
the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and 
the French Legion of Honor medal. 
Following the war, he returned to his 
home State, where he earned his law 
degree from the University of North 
Dakota. In addition to his time as a 
Kiwanis member, Lynn served in our 
State’s legislature for four sessions, 
was the president of the Minot Cham-
ber of Commerce, served on the board 
for the United Way, and has been a 
longtime supporter of Minot State Uni-
versity. 
As a member of the 386th Infantry 
Regiment, John Sinn served in the Eu-
ropean theatre, where he earned the 
Bronze Star. He then returned home to 
farm with family members in Ryder, 
ND, eventually coming to work for the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1957. 
John retired in 1989, more than 30 
years ago. However, rather than taking 
a well-earned rest, he has been hard at 
work serving the Minot community. 
Among his efforts as a volunteer, he is 
best known for his work to improve 
and maintain the Scandinavian Herit-
age Park. 
This is an iconic outdoor museum 
that is central to the community’s 
identity and home to the annual Norsk 
Hostfest, the largest celebration of 
Scandinavian culture and history in 
North America. The best view of the 
park can be found at John Sinn Out-
look, a testament to his many con-
tributions. 
It is therefore appropriate to take 
this time to recognize the hard work, 
dedication, and service of Lynn Aas, 
John Sinn, and the entire Kiwanis Club 
of Minot as they all celebrate their 
100th birthdays this year.

TRIBUTE TO TOM GRESHAM 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, 
on May 31, 2020, Mr. Tom Gresham of 
Indianola, MS, concluded his term as 
the 84th president of Delta Council. I 
am pleased to commend him for his 
service and contributions to the Delta 
region and the State of Mississippi. 
Organized in 1935, Delta Council 
plays an important role in uniting the 
agricultural, business, and economic 
development leadership to solve prob-
lems and promote greater opportuni-
ties in the Mississippi Delta region, 
which 
encompasses 
19 
counties 
in 
Northwest Mississippi. 
Mr. Gresham’s tenure began on the 
heels of the devastating and historical 
Yazoo Backwater Flood of 2019, which 
destroyed thousands of acres, hundreds 
of homes, and took two lives. As a 
Delta native, business owner, and serv-
ant to his community, his leadership 
helped bring tremendous attention and 
change to a new plan proposed by the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ad-
dress this critical flood control issue. 
He also met challenges unlike any 
other Delta Council president in the 
unprecedented times we faced during 
the onset of the global pandemic of 
COVID–19. In leading Delta Council 
throughout his presidency, he navi-
gated the way for the council to con-
tinue its devoted work to the region, 
despite 
the 
difficulties 
the 
virus 
brought us. This included the first-ever 
virtual meeting of Delta Council. 
I also applaud Mr. Gresham, as a 
longtime former chairman of Delta 
Council’s 
Development 
Department, 
along with Delta Strong leadership, on 
bringing hundreds of jobs to the Delta 
through the Delta Strong industrial re-
cruitment initiative. As the president 
of Double Quick, Inc., for over 35 years, 
Tom Gresham knows what it takes to 
grow a successful business in the Delta. 
Despite the time spent dedicated to 
his presidency and career, Mr. Gresham 
still finds time to serve in a multitude 
of capacities locally and regionally. He 
has served in leadership roles as co-
chairman of the Indianola Promise 
Community, director of Northwest Mis-
sissippi Community Foundation, past 
chairman 
of 
Mississippi 
Economic 
Council past president of Mississippi 
Association 
of 
Convenience 
Stores, 
Indianola 
Educational 
Foundation, 
Indianola Rotary Flub, Mid-Delta Arts 
Association, Society of Independent 
Gas Marketers of America, and more. 
I am pleased to join the citizens 
throughout the State of Mississippi in 
commending Thomas G. Gresham and 
sharing our appreciation with his wife 
Louise Houseman Gresham and their 
three adult children and four grand-
children. His input over his year of 
service has undoubtedly contributed to 
the overall success of this highly re-
spected 86-year-old organization, Delta 
Council.∑

TRIBUTE TO PAUL HOLLIS 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to commend Mr. Paul Hol-
lis of Rollingi Fork, MS, for his service 
and contributions to the State of Mis-
sissippi while serving as the 85th presi-
dent of Delta Council. 
Organized in 1935, Delta Council 
plays an important role in uniting the 
agricultural, business, and economic 
development leadership to solve prob-
lems and promote greater opportuni-
ties in the Mississippi Delta region, 
which 
encompasses 
19 
counties 
in 
Northwest Mississippi. 
Mr. Hollis has selflessly committed 
himself this year to the standing prior-
ities of Delta Council’s agenda, namely 
flood 
control, 
among 
other 
major 
issues the council addresses. As the 
owner and operator of Hollis Farms in 
Anguilla, MS, for over 30 years, he 
knows all too well the unjust history 
and devastation the incomplete Yazoo 
Backwater Pumps flood control project 
has brought to his community. There 
are few proponents of the Yazoo Back-
water Pump Project who have volun-
teered the time, loyalty, attention, and 
leadership as fervently as Paul Hollis. 
Mr. Hollis assumed the role of Delta 
Council president in a nontraditional 
fashion by way of the first-ever virtual 
meeting of Delta Council, due to the 
unprecedented challenges we faced dur-
ing the COVID–19 global pandemic. De-
spite the hardships the virus brought 
upon our State and Delta Council, Mr. 
Hollis led this organization admirably 
through the rest of 2020 to restore the 
traditional Delta Council Day at the 
86th annual meeting, at which I am 
honored to serve as the keynote speak-
er. 
Outside of his time spent working on 
his farm and serving Delta Council, Mr. 
Hollis contributes his leadership skills 
to many valuable community organiza-
tions. He serves as commissioner for 
the Mississippi Levee Board and chair-
man of the Delta Council Flood Control 
Committee. He is president of his local

TRIBUTE TO THE CONFEDERATED 
TRIBES OF SILETZ INDIANS 
∑ Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, last 
September, the Echo Mountain Com-
plex Fire swept through Lincoln Coun-
ty in my home State of Oregon. Nearly 
300 homes were destroyed. At least 50 
other buildings and structures were 
burned as well. In just a few days, the 
lives 
that 
residents 
spent 
decades 
building literally went up in smoke. 
These devastated families began look-
ing around for help—for safety and se-
curity; for support getting back on 
their feet and rebuilding their lives. 
And they quickly found that help com-
ing from the Confederated Tribes of 
Siletz Indians.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3890 
May 27, 2021 
Even as the fire raged and families 
raced out of its path, leaving their 
homes and belongings behind, the 
Siletz worked with the Red Cross to 
open the doors of the Chinook Winds 
Casino to provide shelter and safety for 
their 
displaced 
neighbors 
in 
need. 
Sadly that safety and security provided 
by the Siletz was short lived as the ca-
sino itself was forced to be evacuated 
as the fire made its way dangerously 
close. And with the loss of power and 
phones lines and people in their cars on 
the way to the casino while others 
were leaving, it was hard getting any 
clear information. How harrowing it 
must have been for all those who be-
lieved they had escaped the worst, only 
to be forced once more to run from the 
path of an oncoming inferno. But the 
Tribe used the casino’s shuttles to 
bring evacuees to the Newport Red 
Cross site, while staff volunteered to 
help deliver meals to those in need. 
Fortunately, the casino was not dam-
aged, and everyone who was there 
made it to safety. And after the fire 
subsided, leaving a path of destruction 
in its wake, the doors of Chinook 
Winds and its hotel were once again 
opened to those in need. Families and 
members of the community who could 
not be in their homes—whether be-
cause those homes were completed 
gone or damage to roofs and other 
parts made them unlivable—were able 
to stay for up to 3 months at no cost to 
themselves until they could return to 
their own houses or found a new per-
manent living situation. 
But all these months later, many Or-
egonians impacted by the Echo Moun-
tain Complex Fire are still struggling 
to rebuild their lives. Many still don’t 
have a place to call home. Fortunately, 
they once again have the Confederated 
Tribes of Siletz Indians looking out for 
and working with them, in partnership 
with FEMA, to get them back on their 
feet. 
Since March, the Tribe has been 
hosting FEMA provided trailers on 
their lands to house Oregonians im-
pacted by the fire until they can find 
permanent 
housing—something 
that 
could take anywhere from 18 to 24 
months in this part of the State that 
continues to struggle with a shortage 
of affordable housing. 
This is the first time in Oregon’s his-
tory and potentially in the history of 
the whole country that FEMA has 
partnered with the leadership of a 
Tribe to host housing units on Tribal 
lands. FEMA was originally working 
with Lincoln County and Lincoln City 
to put these homes on another site, but 
that effort was stalled when the Agen-
cy found several problems with the 
site. Hearing about the problems and 
recognizing the urgent need to get 
roofs over the heads of these families, 
the Siletz jumped at the chance to help 
out. 
Thanks to the partnership between 
the Tribe’s leaders, FEMA, Lincoln 
City, which had to change a zoning law 
to help make it happen, and Siletz 
Tribal Business Corporation staff, this 
project was developed and completed in 
record time—a testament not only to 
the real need for this help but to every-
one’s commitment to making it hap-
pen. And today, all 25 trailers are fully 
occupied, and the people living there 
have developed their own little com-
munity to support one another. 
We all owe a debt of gratitude to the 
members of the Confederated Tribes of 
Siletz Indians for not only opening 
their doors and helping those in need in 
the middle of two crises—the pandemic 
and the Echo Mountain Complex Fire— 
but for continuing to step up and help 
their neighbors in need all these 
months later. It really speaks to the 
spirit of the Tribe and to the entire Or-
egon community to see that, when 
times get tough and people are in need 
of help, they can count on others to be 
there for them.∑

TRIBUTE TO LISA’S FIFTH STREET 
DINER 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I will recognize an out-
standing Kentucky small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize a family-owned 
small business and beloved staple, 
Lisa’s Fifth Street Diner of Bowling 
Green, KY, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week. 
Located in the heart of Bowling 
Green, KY, Lisa’s Fifth Street Diner 
opened its doors in 2010. After oper-
ating a successful catering business, 
founder and owner Lisa Parker decided 
to open a restaurant with her husband, 
Cliff Parker. Together, they created a 
homestyle diner with delicious food, 
friendly service, and a welcoming at-
mosphere. 
Over a decade later, Lisa’s Fifth 
Street Diner has become a local favor-
ite. They continue welcoming cus-
tomers from all over Kentucky, from 
local Western Kentucky University 
students to baseball fans traveling to 
cheer on the Bowling Green Hot Rods. 
But no matter how far customers trav-
el, they can always depend on Lisa and 
her team to serve them a hot, country- 
style meal with a friendly smile. Their 
outstanding service was covered by 
WNKY TV’s SoKY Sunrise, which rec-
ognizes local small businesses using 
their 
signature 
hashtag, 
‘‘Because 
Local Matters.’’ Additionally, Lisa’s 
Fifth Street Diner has consistently re-
ceived outstanding reviews from local 
and industry outlets alike. 
Like many small business owners, 
Lisa and Cliff are active in their com-
munity, supporting various charitable 
organizations. For several years, the 
Parkers have teamed up with local vol-
unteers to provide free Thanksgiving 
meals to folks in need. In 2018, Lisa’s 
Fifth Street Diner partnered with 
Meijer, a local grocery store, to pro-
vide 300 Thanksgiving meals to fami-
lies in need. This support is not one- 
way, however, with Bowling Green 
stepping up to support the Parkers 
through thick and thin. When the 
COVID–19 pandemic occurred, Bowling 
Green 
continued 
supporting 
Lisa’s 
Fifth Street Diner, ordering carryout 
meals and ensuring this small business 
stayed open throughout the year. In 
early 2021, Lisa, a three-time cancer 
survivor, was diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer. The community rallied around 
her, raising funds and organizing a ben-
efit to support her during this time. 
Despite the challenges, Lisa has con-
tinued to be an uplifting example. In 
April 2021, Lisa was honored as a 
Hughes & Coleman Hometown Hero by 
local news station WBKO. In addition 
to her community leadership, this 
award recognized Lisa’s hard work, 
compassion, and commitment to her 
staff and customers. 
Lisa’s Fifth Street Diner is a remark-
able example of the critical role small 
businesses play in every aspect of 
building community. Small businesses 
like Lisa’s Fifth Street Diner form the 
heart of towns across Kentucky, regu-
larly stepping up to support their com-
munities. 
Congratulations 
to 
Lisa, 
Cliff, and the entire team at Lisa’s 
Fifth Street Diner. I wish them the 
best of luck and look forward to watch-
ing their continued growth and success 
in Kentucky.∑

RECOGNIZING UNCLE LEE’S 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I will recognize an out-
standing Kentucky small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize Uncle Lee’s of 
Greenville, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
In 1975, founder Lee Fauntleroy es-
tablished Uncle Lee’s gun shop. The 
store provided a wide range of supplies 
for sportsmen and hunters in Green-
ville and the Muhlenberg County area. 
Uncle Lee’s grew from 32,000 square 
feet, expanding twice over the next few 
decades. By 2015, this small business 
had 76,000 square feet of retail space 
and featured the largest gun inventory 
available in the State of Kentucky. 
After 40 years of owning and operating 
his small business, Lee was ready to re-
tire and spend more time with his fam-
ily. In 2015, he sold Uncle Lee’s to Lex-
ington-based 
entrepreneurs 
Rex 
McClanahan and Joe Murphy. 
Today, Uncle Lee’s continues to sup-
ply generations of Kentucky hunters 
and 
sportsmen, 
drawing 
customers 
from all over the United States and 
abroad. Together, Rex and Joe have ap-
plied their years of experience running 
and managing several businesses to 
continue growing Uncle Lee’s. Notably, 
Uncle Lee’s features an indoor archery 
range and is the largest retail store in 
Greenville. Uncle Lee’s is an active 
member of the Greater Muhlenberg

Chamber of Commerce, advocating for 
small businesses throughout Green-
ville. They are also involved with local 
advocacy and development organiza-
tions, including the Muhlenberg Coun-
ty Tourism Commission. 
Under Rex and Joe, Uncle Lee’s has 
continued its proud tradition of sup-
porting 
Second 
Amendment 
rights. 
Through classes and workshops, Uncle 
Lee’s supports responsible firearms 
training for gun enthusiasts of all ages. 
They regularly host competitions and 
events, building a sense of community 
among sportsmen and hunters from all 
walks of life. Additionally, Uncle Lee’s 
supports wildlife conservation, encour-
aging hunters and sportsmen to learn 
about and preserve Kentucky’s eco-
systems through wildlife education 
programs, outdoor skills workshops, 
and keeping their community informed 
about Kentucky Department of Fish 
and Wildlife initiatives. 
Uncle Lee’s is a remarkable example 
of the critical role small businesses 
play in building a community and pre-
serving local ecosystems. Small busi-
nesses like Uncle Lee’s form the back-
bone of local economies across Ken-
tucky and regularly step up to support 
their 
communities 
for 
generations. 
Congratulations to the entire team at 
Uncle Lee’s. I wish them the best of 
luck and look forward to watching 
their continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.

TRIBUTE TO NELL ‘‘MICKEY’’ 
STEVENSON BRIGHT 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize the incredible life 
and 
achievements 
of 
veteran 
Nell 
‘‘Mickey’’ Stevenson Bright, a pioneer 
of aviation during the Second World 
War and a proud Utahn. Nell earned 
her silver wings from the Army Air 
Corp as one of a highly select group of 
women serving in the WASP program, 
or Women Airforce Service Pilots. 
These brave women flew over 60 million 
miles in support of the war effort and 
were finally awarded the Congressional 
Gold Medal in 2009 in recognition of 
their valor. 
As a young woman, Nell looked to 
the sky and saw an opportunity to 
chart her own course. After learning to 
fly at age 19, Nell undertook an ambi-
tious 
new 
challenge—applying 
her 
aviation abilities to serve in the mili-
tary. While the war raged around the 
world, Nell applied and was accepted to 
train with the Army Air Corps in 
Sweetwater, TX. Accustomed to the in-
tense heat, wind, and dust as a daugh-
ter of Canyon, TX, Nell proved her tal-
ents in conditions that would trouble 
any uninitiated pilot. Crosswind land-
ings were second nature to the young 
pilot-in-training, 
and 
she 
quickly 
earned her silver wings. She was one of 
1,074 women to achieve this prestigious 
distinction from over 25,000 applicants. 
WASPs flew every airplane the Army 
had in order to execute a variety of 
wartime support operations. Nell flew 
the B–25 twin-engine bomber, P–47 pur-
suit planes, and multiple Navy bomb-
ers. WASPs transported planes and 
cargo from manufacturers to bases, 
towed targets for live anti-aircraft gun 
practice, and simulated strafing mis-
sions. With friendly anti-aircraft guns 
firing live rounds at the women in the 
sky, even their training exercises were 
extraordinarily 
dangerous. 
Thirty- 
eight WASPs lost their lives over the 
course of their service. Their sacrifice 
to our country will never be forgotten. 
Successfully navigating military air-
craft through the skies of war is a chal-
lenge for the most decorated pilots, but 
the WASPs faced adversity on the 
ground, too. Unfortunately, discrimi-
nation was present on base. As women, 
the WASPs were told not to eat in the 
officer’s mess hall, instructions they 
promptly ignored. The Tuskegee Air-
men, the first Black pilots in the serv-
ice, also faced similar barriers on base. 
The WASPs spoke up in their defense, 
and the commanding officer assented. 
When the 20 airmen were required to 
sit segregated, the WASPs refused to 
accept the injustice and joined them. 
WASPs would continue their fight for 
recognition after the war, contesting 
their civil service classification despite 
holding military officer status. In 1977, 
the WASPs received veteran status, 
which granted them their well-earned 
and hard-fought benefits. 
Nell is a pioneer of military aviation, 
and her legacy will continue to inspire 
the next generation of public servants, 
particularly young women. By virtue 
of her bravery and valor, she helped 
break gender barriers in the military 
and contributed to the ever-growing di-
versity in our ranks today. After her 
service, Nell established a successful 
career as a stockbroker in Arizona and 
continued to challenge traditional gen-
der norms. 
Today, Nell calls our great State of 
Utah home. In 2014, she received the 
Minute Man Award from the Utah Na-
tional Guard and Honorary Colonels 
Corps for her service to her country 
and community. She also earned the 
2014 Leadership and Excellence Award 
from 
Brigham 
Young 
University, 
ROTC. 
Nell Stevenson Bright celebrates her 
100th birthday on June 20. Our State 
and our country owe her a debt of grat-
itude for her courage, valor, and 
groundbreaking public service. Thank 
you, Nell.∑

OR
PRO-
GRAMS.—The 
Commission 
shall 
use 
the 
amounts made available under subsection (d) 
to establish 1 or more programs that are sep-
arate from, but are coordinated with and

(1), the Commission shall use amounts made 
available under subsection (d) in an efficient 
and cost-effective manner only— 
(A) for the assessment of, and to provide 
subsidies in a technology-neutral manner 
through a competitive process (subject to 
weighting preferences for performance qual-
ity and other service metrics as the Commis-
sion may find appropriate) to providers for 
support of, deployment of broadband-capable 
infrastructure in high-cost rural areas that 
the Commission determines are unserved by 
fixed terrestrial broadband internet access 
service at a download speed of not less than 
25 megabits per second and an upload speed 
of not less than 3 megabits per second (or 
such higher speed as the Commission may 
determine appropriate based upon an evolv-
ing definition of universal service); and 
(B) to assess, and provide subsidies to pro-
viders 
to

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 1906. A bill to amend the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act to estab-
lish a grant program to support the 
restoration of San Francisco Bay, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Environment and Public Works. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to introduce the ‘‘San 
Francisco 
Bay 
Restoration 
Act.’’ 
Thank you to Senator PADILLA for co-
sponsoring and I am happy to be once 
again be working with Congresswoman 
JACKIE SPEIER, who is leading the bill 
in the House. 
This legislation would create a San 
Francisco Bay Program within the En-
vironmental Protection Agency dedi-
cated to conserving and protecting the 
San 
Francisco 
Bay 
estuary 
eco-
system—the largest estuary in the 
western United States. 
The San Francisco Bay estuary is 
truly a national treasure, and it is 
vital to the nation’s environmental and 
economic health. It is home to more 
than 1,000 plant and wildlife species, 
roughly 77% of California’s remaining 
perennial estuarine wetlands, and an 
important stopover for birds along the 
Pacific Flyway. The Bay region pro-
duces more than $370 billion in goods 
and supports more than 4 million jobs. 
Unfortunately, during the last 150 
years, the water quality and health of 
the San Francisco Bay has been dimin-
ished. According to the United States 
Geological Survey, the Bay has lost 
95% of its wetlands, which serve as 
both habitat for vulnerable species and 
as an important barrier to protect 
against climate change impacts such as 
rising sea levels and extreme weather 
events made only more common by 
global warming. 
The program created within EPA to 
focus on the San Francisco Bay Estu-
ary would increase federal investment 
into the San Francisco Bay Estuary to 
ensure that it can continue to support 
the 
environment, 
agriculture, 
and 
economy for generations to come. 
A 2018 General Accounting Office re-
port on the San Francisco Bay Delta 
Watershed found that the lack of suffi-
cient Federal funding is one of the big-
gest risks to long-term restoration ef-
forts, and a major factor limiting habi-
tat restoration and water quality im-
provement. 
The GAO noted that while Bay Area 
voters 
established 
a 
local 
funding 
source through a bond measure for 
some Bay restoration, local funding 
‘‘needs to be leveraged by significant 
state and Federal dollars to meet the 
estimated $1.5 billion needed for res-
toration in the Bay Area.’’ 
This bill recognizes the important 
restoration work that must be done to 
protect and restore the iconic San 
Francisco Bay Estuary. It authorizes 
$50 million per year for five years for 
the creation of the San Francisco Pro-
gram office. 
This program office would work with 
local stakeholders to compile an an-
nual list of project and study priorities 
that advance the goals of the National 
Estuary Program for the San Francisco 
Bay estuary. 
Funds would be distributed by the 
agency in a competitive grant pro-
gram, prioritizing projects that im-
prove water quality, provide wetland 
restoration, promote endangered spe-
cies recovery, and support adaptation 
to climate change. 
This legislation would bring the Fed-
eral funding investment in line with 
other major estuaries in the country, 
like the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, 
and Puget Sound. 
This is another example of the type 
of front-end investment in green infra-
structure and natural resources that 
will only pay dividends in the future 
and, most importantly, for future gen-
erations. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this bill. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. COONS, Mr. DURBIN, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Ms. CORTEZ
MASTO, and 
Ms. HIRONO):

Border Protection; to the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the ‘‘Access to Counsel 
Act.’’ 
This legislation would ensure that all 
individuals with a legal right to be in 
the United States and are detained by 
Customs and Border Protection at 
ports of entry or airports have access 
to legal counsel. 
This legislation would ensure that in-
dividuals who have legal status in the 
U.S. and are detained by Customs and 
Border Protection in secondary inspec-
tion at airports or other points of entry 
for more than an hour are granted an 
opportunity to access legal counsel and 
an interested party. An interested 
party is defined as a family member, 
sponsor, or organization with a connec-
tion to the individual. 
The bill provides no obligation for 
the Federal government to pay for 
counsel and allows counsel the ability 
to advocate on behalf of the individual 
by providing information or docu-
mentation in support of the individual. 
It also invalidates any effort by CBP 
to persuade someone to relinquish 
their legal status if that person has 
been denied access to counsel or volun-
tarily waives in writing their right to 
counsel. 
The Trump Administration’s immi-
gration policies often caused unneces-
sary chaos and confusion. 
One vivid example of this is when the 
first Muslim Ban was implemented, in 
early 2017, and thousands of U.S. citi-
zens, green card holders, and others 
with valid visas were detained at air-
ports for hours. 
They were held by Customs and Bor-
der Protection officers without any 
ability to call a lawyer, a relative or an 
advocate. Many members of Congress 
rushed to the airports in an attempt to 
help these individuals and were barred 
from speaking to them or connecting 
them with attorneys. 
In addition, in early 2020, 200 Iranian 
Americans were held at the northern 
border in Blaine, WA for 12 hours with-
out access to counsel. 
While President Biden has rescinded 
the travel bans, it is imperative that 
Americans and those with a legal right 
to be here have access to representa-
tion if they are held at a port of entry. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
CARDIN, Mr. MARSHALL, Ms. 
STABENOW, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. 
KING, Mr. CASSIDY, Ms. SINEMA, 
Mr. MENENDEZ, and Ms. ROSEN): 
S. 1943. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to improve ac-
cess to, and utilization of, bone mass 
measurement benefits under part B of 
the Medicare program by establishing a 
minimum payment amount under such 
part for bone mass measurement; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to reintroduce legislation with 
my colleague from Maryland, Senator 
BEN CARDIN, to increase access to pre-
ventive bone density screenings and to 
improve osteoporosis diagnosis and 
treatment in the process. 
May is National Osteoporosis month. 
Approximately 54 million Americans 
have osteoporosis or low bone mass. 
Women are disproportionally affected, 
accounting 
for 
71 
percent 
of 
osteoporotic fractures and 75 percent of 
health costs related to osteoporosis. 
Osteoporosis is often called ‘‘the si-
lent disease’’ because bone loss usually 
occurs gradually over the years with-
out 
symptoms. 
As 
the 
NIH 
Osteoporosis and Related Bone Dis-
eases National Resource Center ob-
serves, falls are especially dangerous 
for people who are unaware that they 
have low bone density. If the patient 
and the doctor fail to identify the link 
between 
the 
broken 
bone 
and 
osteoporosis, the chance to make a di-
agnosis with a bone density test and 
begin a treatment program may be 
lost. 
Our legislation, the Increasing Ac-
cess to Osteoporosis Testing for Medi-
care Beneficiaries Act of 2021, tackles a 
proven barrier to proper screening by 
creating a floor reimbursement rate 
under Medicare for the dual energy X- 
ray absorptiometry (DXA) test, the 
‘‘gold standard’’ for osteoporosis diag-
nosis. 
Congress has twice recognized the 
importance of reversing Medicare cuts 
to DXA reimbursement in order to 
maintain patient access to this test, 
yet the Medicare reimbursement rate 
for DXA tests administered in a doc-
tor’s office has declined from $140 in 
2006 to only $42 in 2018—a dramatic 70 
percent decline. It is not surprising 
that this inadequate reimbursement 
has led to a decline in screenings. 
The National Osteoporosis Founda-
tion has found that declining reim-
bursement rates have created a 26 per-
cent decline in physicians performing 
DXA tests since 2008, resulting in a cor-
responding 22 percent decline in diag-
noses since 2009. 
Regrettably, the result of reduced 
screenings due to declining reimburse-
ments produces real harm. It is esti-
mated that more than 40,000 additional 
hip fractures occur each year, resulting 
in nearly 10,000 additional hip fracture- 
related deaths. Keep in mind that these 
painful and costly fractures, and even 
deaths, are all occurring at a time 
when early diagnosis and treatment of 
osteoporosis are proven to reduce frac-
ture rates dramatically. 
With osteoporosis already an under- 
diagnosed condition in the Medicare 
population, it is clear that we must 
change this trajectory I thank Senator 
CARDIN for joining me in this effort to 
increase patient access to osteoporosis 
screening and diagnosis, while lowering 
cost and consequences resulting from a 
lack of diagnosis. I encourage my col-
leagues to support its adoption. Thank 
you, Mr. President.

Mr. TESTER): 
S. 1944. A bill to improve Vet Centers

and for other purposes; to the Com-

tration facilities. Today. there is a 
need to enhance these Centers to con-
tinue to realize that original vision— 
which is why I am reintroducing the 
Vet Center Improvement Act. 
This legislation is the product of a 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
(GAO) 
investigation 
that 
Senator 
TESTER and I requested into allega-
tions that changes to performance 
metrics at Vet Centers may have nega-
tively impacted quality of care as well 
as additional concerns that we had 
about their staffing practices. The GAO 
report concluded that recent changes 
‘‘have the potential to negatively af-
fect care and create undue burden and 
stress on counselors providing that 
care at some Vet Centers.’’ This report 
included recommendations to improve 
care, transparency. and hiring and 
staffing methods that are the founda-
tion for our legislation. 
Specifically, the Vet Center Improve-
ment Act requires periodic review and 
reform of performance standards at Vet 
Centers; the creation and periodic re-
evaluation of a staffing model, along 
with standardization of position de-
scriptions and responsibilities across 
Vet Centers; the creation of a working 
group to implement changes to im-
prove quality of care for veterans and 
recruitment and retention of staff; and 
the GAO to review Vet Center infra-
structure and examine what future in-
vestments are needed. Additionally, 
our legislation creates a $50 million 
pilot program to provide grants to 
combat food insecurity and provide 
necessary heating and cooling assist-
ance to veterans and their families. 
Unfortunately, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has further underscored the need for 
this legislation—to ensure that we are 
providing high quality counseling serv-
ices and offering programs that help 
our veterans meet their daily needs, 
like feeding their families and heating 
their homes. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
thank 
Senator 
TESTER for joining me in introducing 
this important legislation and the at-
tention he has paid to this issue as 
Ranking Member and now Chairman of 
the Senate Veterans Affairs Com-
mittee. Our legislation has received 
support from such organizations as the 
Veterans 
of 
Foreign 
Wars 
(VFW), 
American Veterans (AMVETS), Na-
tional Community Action Foundation 
(NCAF), National Association for State 
Community 
Services 
Programs

ity Affordability Coalition (NEUAC),

By Mr. REED: 
S. 1954. A bill to reauthorize the John 
H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley Na-
tional Heritage Corridor, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
introducing legislation to reauthorize 
the John H. Chafee Blackstone River 
Valley National Heritage Corridor for 
the next fifteen years. This legislation 
will continue to preserve the indus-
trial, natural, and cultural heritage of 
the Blackstone River Valley for gen-
erations to come. 
In 1986, Congress designated the 
Blackstone River Valley as a National 
Heritage Corridor, recognizing the re-
gion’s critical contributions to the 
American Industrial Revolution. In-
deed, in 1793. Samuel Slater initiated 
the American Industrial Revolution in 
Rhode Island when he built his historic 
mill 
along 
the 
Blackstone 
River, 
Today, the mills and villages through-
out the Corridor reflect the legacy of 
this key chapter in American history. 
Encompassing both Rhode Island and 
Massachusetts, the John H. Chafee 
Blackstone River Valley National Her-
itage Corridor links twenty-four com-
munities along the Blackstone River 
from Providence to Worcester. The 
Corridor has also served as a critical 
partner to the Blackstone River Valley 
National Historical Park, resulting in 
the recovery of dozens of historic vil-
lages, waterways, and rural landscapes 
throughout the Blackstone River Val-
ley, which includes thousands of acres 
of beautiful lands and waters that are 
home to diverse wildlife. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this legislation to ensure 
the 
continued 
preservation 
of 
the 
Blackstone River Valley for the benefit 
of our natural resources and our coun-
try’s history.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
246—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE THAT CRITICAL RACE 
THEORY SERVES AS A PREJU-
DICIAL 
IDEOLOGICAL 
TOOL, 
RATHER THAN AN EDUCATIONAL 
TOOL, 
AND 
SHOULD 
NOT 
BE 
TAUGHT IN K–12 CLASSROOMS AS 
A WAY TO TEACH STUDENTS TO 
JUDGE INDIVIDUALS BASED ON 
SEX, RACE, ETHNICITY, OR NA-
TIONAL ORIGIN 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. BRAUN, and Mrs. BLACKBURN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 246 
Whereas Critical Race Theory seeks to por-
tray the United States not as a united Na-
tion of people, families, and communities 
striving for a common purpose, but rather a 
Nation of many victimized groups based on 
sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory’s teachings 
stand in contrast to the overarching goal of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent dis-
crimination on the basis of race, color, or na-
tional origin in the United States; 
Whereas William Jacobson, a Cornell Uni-
versity professor, created criticalrace.org to 
highlight the over 200 universities across the 
Nation with Critical Race Theory program-
ming; 
Whereas, while present on college and uni-
versity campuses for decades, Critical Race 
Theory has increasingly infiltrated our Na-
tion’s elementary and secondary school 
classrooms in recent years; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory serves to re-
segregate institutions of education and bal-
kanize students into groups by race and eth-
nicity; 
Whereas efforts to indoctrinate Critical 
Race Theory into United States school chil-
dren are designed to eventually transform 
the United States by stigmatizing its eco-
nomic system and creating a hatred of all its 
institutions; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory founder Der-
rick Bell has stated that ‘‘most critical race 
theorists are committed to a program of 
scholarly resistance, and most hope schol-
arly resistance will lay the groundwork for 
wide-scale resistance’’; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory serves to re-
inforce the soft bigotry of low expectations 
by substituting systemic racism as the de-
termining factor in academic achievement 
gaps rather than the ongoing failure of pol-
icymakers and the education system to pro-
vide students of color necessary educational 
opportunities; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory has mani-
fested itself in various damaging ways in 
United States elementary and secondary 
schools; 
Whereas the 1619 Project, which puts slav-
ery, not the ideal of equality, at the center 
of our Nation’s storyline and has been widely 
debunked by historians across the ideolog-
ical spectrum, is nevertheless being taught 
in 4,500 classrooms across the country; 
Whereas the California Department of Edu-
cation (CDE) Foundation, in partnership 
with over 30 education organizations and the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, devel-
oped ‘‘A Pathway to Equitable Math Instruc-
tion’’ toolkit that promotes the concept that 
White supremacy manifests itself through 
the focus on finding the right answers, there-
by discouraging teachers from requiring stu-
dents to show their work or consider ways 
there could be 2 answers to a problem; 
Whereas, in 2017, the Seattle Public School 
Board directed the Ethnic Studies Task 
Force to develop an ethnic studies cur-
riculum, which defined ethnic studies as a 
way to counteract systems of oppression, 
such as patriarchy and capitalism; 
Whereas the Madison Metropolitan School 
District is requiring staff to participate in a 
mandatory 21 hours of professional develop-
ment that claim practices such as teachers 
leading a classroom, keeping a class on 
schedule, and the term ‘‘student’’ are a part 
of White, Western thought and are racist; 
Whereas students at a Las Vegas charter 
school were required to take a year-long vir-
tual ‘‘Sociology of Change’’ course where as-
signments required students to reveal their 
race, gender, sexual orientation, and disabil-
ities and then determine if oppression or 
privilege were a part of those identities, al-
legedly without any accommodations if a 
student had a conscientious objection to the 
course; 
Whereas, in October 2020, the San Diego 
Unified School District Board of Education 
voted to change ‘‘discriminatory grading 
practices’’ and no longer requires students to 
turn in their homework on time in order to 
‘‘be an anti-racist school district’’; 
Whereas, while students should learn how 
to actively engage in civil society, Critical 
Race Theory often advocates for ‘‘action 
civics’’, which in some school districts has 
resulted in students being taught how to en-
gage in disruptive protests without as much 
concern for teaching the fundamentals of 
how government works and why; 
Whereas, according to the Annenberg Pub-
lic Policy Center at the University of Penn-
sylvania, just over half of all individuals in 
the 
United 
States 
cannot 
name 
all 
3 
branches of Government, and 76 percent of 
eighth grade students scored at or below pro-
ficient in civics on the most recent National 
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) 
assessment; 
Whereas State legislators across the coun-
try have introduced bills to prevent schools 
from teaching that— 
(1) the United States is fundamentally rac-
ist or sexist; and 
(2) on account of an individual’s race or 
gender, they may be responsible for actions 
committed in the past; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the Depart-
ment of Education’s Office for Civil Rights 
posted a webinar to provide an overview on 
how racially exclusive practices are prohib-
ited under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), but the Depart-
ment of Education has since archived the 
webinar and labeled it as ‘‘not for reliance’’; 
and 
Whereas, on January 22, 2021, the Depart-
ment of Education’s Office for Civil Rights 
reportedly suspended a finding that an Illi-
nois school district violated title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act when it segregated students 
and staff, directed teachers to treat students 
differently based on their race, and endorsed 
racially charged messages: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns racism in all forms and calls 
on the people of the United States to elimi-
nate racism and defend the civil rights of all 
individuals, including within our Nation’s 
education system; 
(2) calls on the Department of Education’s 
Office for Civil Rights and State attorneys 
general to assist schools in being compliant 
with existing civil rights laws and to inves-
tigate and enforce the law when appropriate; 
(3) supports the actions taken by States 
and communities to implement policies and 
practices to protect the rights of parents and 
guardians to know what their children are 
being taught; 
(4) calls on States and communities to sup-
port curriculum transparency policies that 
make elementary and secondary education 
curriculum materials accessible, including 
online, to parents, guardians, and the public 
for review before the use of such materials; 
(5) recognizes that open enrollment and 
school choice policies allow students to ac-
cess the school, and thereby the curriculum, 
which the parent or guardian believes is best 
positioned to educate the student; 
(6) condemns State and local educational 
agencies that facilitate or expend resources 
on education and professional development 
exercises that focus on ostracizing 1 indi-
vidual or group from another; 
(7) condemns the practice of requiring 
teachers to receive Critical Race Theory 
education in order to be certified as a teach-
er; and

submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 247 
Whereas the people of the United States 
join together each May to pay tribute to the 
contributions of generations of Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched 
the history of the United States; 
Whereas the history of Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders in the United States is 
inextricably tied to the story of the United 
States; 
Whereas the Asian-American and Pacific 
Islander community is an inherently diverse 
population, composed of more than 45 dis-
tinct ethnicities and more than 100 language 
dialects; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of the 
Census, the Asian-American population grew 
faster than any other racial or ethnic group 
over the last decade, surging nearly 72 per-
cent between 2000 and 2015; 
Whereas there are approximately 22,000,000 
residents of the United States who identify 
as Asian and approximately 1,600,000 resi-
dents of the United States who identify as 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 
making up nearly 7 percent of the total pop-
ulation of the United States; 
Whereas the month of May was selected for 
Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month be-
cause the first Japanese immigrants arrived 
in the United States on May 7, 1843, and the 
first transcontinental railroad was com-
pleted on May 10, 1869, with substantial con-
tributions from Chinese immigrants; 
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United 
States Code, officially designates May as 
Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month and 
requests the President to issue an annual 
proclamation calling on the people of the 
United States to observe the month with ap-
propriate programs, ceremonies, and activi-
ties; 
Whereas on April 30, 2021, President Biden 
issued a proclamation on Asian American 
and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Herit-
age Month, recognizing the history, achieve-
ments, and diversity of Asian Americans and 
Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, and the 
systemic barriers to economic justice, health 
equity, educational attainment, and personal 
safety experienced by many in the Asian- 
American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Is-
lander community; 
Whereas 2021 marks several important 
milestones for the Asian-American and Pa-
cific Islander community, including— 
(1) the 45th anniversary of Presidential 
Proclamation 4417, dated February 19, 1976 
(41 Fed. Reg. 7741), in which President Gerald 
Ford formally rescinded Executive Order 9066 
(7 Fed. Reg. 1407; relating to authorizing the 
Secretary of War to prescribe military areas) 
and condemned the incarceration of United 
States citizens and lawful permanent resi-
dents of Japanese ancestry during World War 
II; 
(2) the 65th anniversary of the election to 
the House of Representatives of Dalip Singh 
Saund, the first Asian American, first Indian 
American, and first Sikh American elected 
to Congress; 
(3) the 75th anniversary of the passage of 
the amendments made by the Act of July 2, 
1946 (commonly known as the ‘‘Luce–Cellar 
Act of 1946’’) (60 Stat. 416, chapter 534), which 
allowed Filipinos and Indians to immigrate 
to the United States and become naturalized 
United States citizens; 
(4) the 75th anniversary of the passage of 
the First Supplemental Surplus Appropria-
tion Rescission Act, 1946 (Public Law 79–301; 
60 Stat. 6), and the Second Supplemental 
Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act, 1946 
(Public Law 79–391; 60 Stat. 221), which 
stripped military benefits from Filipino 
World War II veterans in the service of the 
United States Armed Forces; 
(5) the 100th anniversary of the first pre-
mier in a United States film of an Asian- 
American woman, Anna May Wong, in ‘‘Bits 
of Life’’; and 
(6) the 120th anniversary of the arrival of 
Peter Ryu, the first Korean immigrant in 
the United States; 
Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers have made significant contributions 
to the United States at all levels of the Fed-
eral Government and in the United States 
Armed Forces, including— 
(1) Daniel K. Inouye, a Medal of Honor and 
Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient 
who, as President pro tempore of the Senate, 
was the highest-ranking Asian-American 
government official in the history of the 
United States; 
(2) Dalip Singh Saund, the first Asian- 
American Congressman; 
(3) Patsy T. Mink, the first woman of color 
and Asian-American woman to be elected to 
Congress; 
(4) Hiram L. Fong, the first Asian-Amer-
ican Senator; 
(5) Daniel K. Akaka, the first Senator of 
Native Hawaiian ancestry; 
(6) Norman Y. Mineta, the first Asian- 
American member of a Presidential cabinet; 
(7) Elaine L. Chao, the first Asian-Amer-
ican woman member of a Presidential cabi-
net; and 
(8) Kamala D. Harris, the first woman and 
the first Asian American to hold the Office 
of the Vice President; 
Whereas, in 2021, the Congressional Asian 
Pacific American Caucus, a bicameral cau-
cus of Members of Congress advocating on 
behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers, is composed of 75 Members, includ-
ing 18 Members of Asian or Pacific Islander 
descent; 
Whereas, in 2021, Asian Americans and Pa-
cific Islanders are serving in State and Terri-
torial legislatures across the United States 
in record numbers, including in— 
(1) the States of Alaska, Arizona, Cali-
fornia, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Ha-
waii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Min-
nesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, 
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, 
Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wis-
consin, and Wyoming; and 
(2) the Territories of American Samoa, 
Guam, and the Commonwealth of the North-
ern Mariana Islands; 
Whereas, in 2021, Asian Americans and Pa-
cific Islanders honorably serve throughout 
the Federal judiciary; 
Whereas, since January 2020, the increased 
use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric 
related 
to 
the 
2019 
novel 
coronavirus 
(‘‘COVID–19’’) has perpetuated an anti-Asian 
stigma and has resulted in a dramatic in-
crease in reports of hate crimes and inci-
dents against individuals of Asian descent; 
Whereas there remains much to be done to 
ensure that Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers have access to resources and a voice 
in the Government of the United States and 
continue to advance in the political land-
scape of the United States; and 
Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific Amer-
ican Heritage Month provides the people of 
the United States with an opportunity to 
recognize the achievements, contributions, 
and history of, and to understand the chal-
lenges faced by, Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the significance of Asian/Pa-
cific American Heritage Month as an impor-
tant time to celebrate the significant con-
tributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers to the history of the United States; 
and 
(2) recognizes that Asian-American and Pa-

diversity of and strengthen the United 
States.

Ms. DUCKWORTH (for herself, Mr. 
MORAN, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. COTTON, Ms. 
ERNST, and Ms. HIRONO) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Armed 
Services: 
S. RES. 249 
Whereas during World War II (referred to 
in this preamble as the ‘‘War’’), despite so-
cial stigmas against women serving in uni-
form, women in the United States served in 
the Armed Forces in vast numbers; 
Whereas 
Congresswoman 
Edith 
Nourse 
Rogers of Massachusetts introduced legisla-
tion to create the Women’s Army Auxiliary 
Corps (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘WAAC’’) in May 1941, which was signed into 
law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 
May 15, 1942; 
Whereas the first director of the WAAC, 
Oveta Culp Hobby, was sworn in on May 16, 
1942, and shortly thereafter began the proc-
ess of recruiting women to join the WAAC, 
which garnered over 35,000 applications for 
an anticipated 1,000 available positions; 
Whereas the first recruits for the newly- 
created WAAC arrived at the first training 
center on July 20, 1942, with 125 enlisted 
women and 440 officer candidates, 40 of whom 
were Black; 
Whereas, during the War, women serving in 
the Army in the WAAC and the Women’s 
Army Corps (referred to in this preamble as 
the ‘‘WAC’’) performed duties traditionally 
performed by men; 
Whereas, in unspoken recognition of the 
value of their services, the Army removed 
the auxiliary status of the WAAC units in 
1943, which gave women all of the rank, 
privileges, and benefits of male soldiers; 
Whereas almost 1⁄2 of the members of the 
WAC during the War served in the Army Air 
Forces as officers and enlisted personnel, 
with duties including radio operator, photog-
rapher, and flight clerk; 
Whereas 7,315 of those members of the 
Army Air Forces WAC were serving overseas 
in all theaters of the War in January 1945; 
Whereas, at the end of the War, 657 women 
were honored for their service in the WAAC 
and the WAC, receiving medals and cita-
tions, including the Distinguished Service 
Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Air Medal, 
the Soldiers’ Medal for heroic action, the 
Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star; 
Whereas, in 1946, the Army requested that 
Congress establish the WAC as a permanent 
part of the Army, perhaps the single greatest 
indication of the value of women in the 
Army to the effort of the United States in 
the War; 
Whereas, during the War, women served 
with the Army Air Forces in the Women’s 
Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron, the Women’s 
Flying 
Training 
Detachment, 
and 
the 
Women Air Force Service Pilots (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘WASPs’’); 
Whereas women serving with the Army Air 
Forces— 
(1) ferried planes from factories to air-
fields; 
(2) performed test flights of repaired air-
craft towed targets used in live gunnery 
practice; and 
(3) performed a variety of other duties tra-
ditionally performed by men; 
Whereas women pilots flew more than 70 
types of military aircraft, from open-cockpit 
primary trainers to P-51 Mustangs, B-26 Ma-
rauders, and B-29 Superfortresses; 
Whereas, from September 10, 1942, to De-
cember 20, 1944, 1,074 WASPs flew an aggre-
gate 60,000,000 miles in wartime service; 
Whereas, although WASPs were promised 
military classification, they were classified 
as civilians, and the 38 WASPs who died in 
the line of duty were regrettably buried 
without military honors; 
Whereas WASPs did not receive official 
status as military veterans until March 1979, 
when WASP units were formally recognized 
as components of the Air Force; 
Whereas, during the War, women in the 
Navy served in the Women Accepted for Vol-
unteer Emergency Service (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘WAVES’’); 
Whereas, 
approximately 
90,000 
WAVES 
served the Navy in a variety of capacities 
and in such numbers that, according to a 
Navy estimate, enough sailors were freed for 
combat duty to crew the ships of 4 major 
task forces, each including a battleship, 2 
large aircraft carriers, 2 heavy cruisers, 4 
light cruisers, and 15 destroyers; 
Whereas WAVES who served in naval avia-
tion taught instrument flying, aircraft rec-
ognition, celestial navigation, aircraft gun-
nery, radio, radar, air combat information, 
and air fighter administration, but were not 
allowed to be pilots; 
Whereas, at the end of the War, Secretary 
of the Navy James Forrestal stated that 
members of the WAVES ‘‘have exceeded per-
formance of men in certain types of work, 
and the Navy Department considers it to be 
very desirable that these important services 
rendered by women during the war should 
likewise be available in postwar years 
ahead’’; 
Whereas, during the War, women served in 
the Marine Corps Women’s Reserve; 
Whereas more than 23,000 women served at 
shore establishments of the Marine Corps, 
and by the end of the War, 85 percent of the 
enlisted personnel assigned to Headquarters 
Marine Corps were women; 
Whereas, during the War, women were as-
signed to over 200 different specialties in the 
Marine Corps and, by performing those du-
ties, freed other Marines for active duty to 
fight; 
Whereas, during the War, women served in 
the Coast Guard Women’s Reserve (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘SPARs’’); 
Whereas more than 10,000 women volun-
teered for service with the Coast Guard dur-
ing the period from 1942 through 1946, and 
when the Coast Guard was at the peak of its 
strength during the War, 1 out of every 16 
members of the Coast Guard was a SPAR; 
Whereas the SPARs who attended the 
Coast Guard Academy were the first women 
in the United States to attend a military 
academy; 
Whereas, by the end of the War, more than 
400,000 women had served the United States 
in military capacities; 
Whereas those women who served, despite 
their merit and the recognized value and im-
portance of their contributions to the effort 
of the United States during the War— 
(1) were not given status equal to their 
male counterparts; and 
(2) struggled for years to receive the appre-
ciation of Congress and the people of the 
United States; 
Whereas those women helped to catalyze 
the social, demographic, and economic evo-
lutions that occurred after the War and that 
continue to this day; and 
Whereas those pioneering women are owed 
a great debt of gratitude for their service to 
the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the women who served the 
United States in military capacities during 
World War II; 
(2) commends those women who, through a 
sense of duty and willingness to defy stereo-
types and social pressures, performed mili-
tary assignments to aid the war effort, al-
lowing for more combat capacity; 
(3) recognizes that those women, by serv-
ing with diligence and merit, not only 
opened up opportunities for women that had 
previously been reserved for men, but also 
contributed vitally to the victory of the 
United States and the Allies in World War II; 
and 
(4) honors the contributions of Congress-
woman Edith Nourse Rogers and her fellow 
Members of Congress who supported the es-
tablishment of the Women’s Army Auxiliary 
Corps and the Women’s Army Corps.

Greenblatt, remarked, ‘‘as violence between 
Israel and Hamas continues to escalate, we 
are witnessing a dangerous and drastic surge 
in anti-Jewish hate. We are tracking acts of 
harassment, vandalism, and violence as well 
as a torrent of online abuses.’’; 
Whereas anti-Semitic incidents have been 
reported against Jewish communities around 
the world, including in Europe, the Middle 
East, South Asia, North Africa, and North 
America; 
Whereas a particularly high rate of anti- 
Semitic attacks have been reported in Eu-
rope since violence broke out between Israel 
and the designated foreign terrorist organi-
zation Hamas, with synagogues, nongovern-
mental organizations (NGOs), and Jewish 
community centers being vandalized in the 
United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain; 
Whereas a similar rise in global, anti-Jew-
ish crimes took place during the 2014 Gaza 
War, when Hamas fired some 4,500 rockets at 
Israel over the span of 50 days, endangering 
the lives of countless civilians; 
Whereas, in response to an ‘‘unprece-
dented’’ rise in anti-Semitic crimes in the 
United Kingdom, like the assault against 
Rabbi Rafi Goodwin in North London, Prime 
Minister Boris Johnson rightly reaffirmed 
his support for the United Kingdom’s Jewish 
community; 
Whereas pro-Palestinian demonstrators in 
Canada have compared Israel with the Nazis, 
used anti-Semitic slurs, violently targeted 
pro-Israel demonstrators with rocks, and dis-
played posters calling for ‘‘Death to Israel’’, 
and protestors in Spain displayed desecrated 
Israeli flags with swastikas imposed onto the 
Star of David; 
Whereas, at a pro-Palestinian demonstra-
tion in the Netherlands, attendants report-
edly referred to Prime Minister Mark Rutte 
as ‘‘cancer Jew’’ and shouted ‘‘Heil Hitler’’; 
Whereas, since violence broke out between 
Israel and militants in the Gaza Strip earlier 
this month, numerous Jewish community 
centers, nongovernmental organizations, and 
synagogues have come under attack in Ger-
many, and in some cases received threats re-
garding the intent to commit physical harm; 
Whereas, in Argentina, a Jewish commu-
nity building was vandalized with graffiti 
saying ‘‘we are going to kill you’’, and ‘‘Jew-
ish rats’’, and swastika crosses were imposed 
onto sidewalks; 
Whereas the rise of anti-Israel groups and 
voices in the United States has contributed 
to increased anti-Semitism in, and outside, 
the United States; 
Whereas this rhetoric has fueled support 
for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions 
(BDS) movement which represents a finan-
cial, political, and economic manifestation 
of anti-Semitism against Israel; and 
Whereas the people and Government of the 
United States stand strongly with our Israeli 
allies and reaffirm Israel’s right to self-de-
fense against threats emanating from United 
States- designated foreign terrorist organi-
zations, including Hamas and Palestinian Is-
lamic Jihad: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns expressions of anti-Semitism 
being reported around the world, including 
those taking place in the United States; 
(2) rejects anti-Semitism in all its forms, 
and reaffirms its commitment to under-
standing, tolerance, and equality; 
(3) stands by Jewish communities around 
the world as they face unacceptable levels of 
risk based on extremist views; 
(4) reaffirms our strong support for our 
Israeli allies, who faced numerous attacks 
from Iran-backed militants in the Gaza 
Strip; 
(5) calls on the President to urgently ap-
point a Special Envoy to Monitor and Com-
bat anti-Semitism at the Department of 
State to help coordinate United States pol-
icy regarding anti-Semitic crimes around 
the world; and 
(6) condemns the BDS movement for con-
tributing to the rise of anti-Semitism.

PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
ON 
FUTURE 
INTER-
NATIONAL 
ARMS 
CONTROL 
AGREEMENTS 
Mr. DAINES submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 251 
Whereas the United States and the former 
Soviet Union signed the Intermediate-Range 
Nuclear Forces Treaty (commonly referred 
to as the ‘‘INF Treaty’’), which entered into 
force on June 1, 1988, for the purposes of 
strengthening international peace and secu-
rity and avoiding the devastating con-
sequences of nuclear war; 
Whereas the INF Treaty required the 
United States and the former Soviet Union, 
the 2 dominant world powers at the time, to 
eliminate their ground-launched ballistic 
and cruise missiles with ranges of between 
500 and 5,500 kilometers (between 300 and 
3,400 miles) by an implementation deadline 
of June 1, 1991; 
Whereas, by that deadline, both countries 
destroyed a total of 2,692 short- and inter-
mediate-range missiles, with the former So-
viet Union destroying 1,846 such missiles and 
the United States destroying 846 such mis-
siles; 
Whereas the United States upheld the 
terms of the INF Treaty for more than 3 dec-
ades; 
Whereas the Russian Federation violated 
the terms of the INF Treaty by developing, 
producing, and testing the SSC–8/9M729, a 
ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with 
a range of 2,500 kilometers; 
Whereas, in December 2019, the United 
States withdrew from the INF Treaty upon 
finding the Russian Federation in material 
breach of the treaty, with the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization concurring in the find-
ing; and 
Whereas, during the period in which the 
INF Treaty was in effect, the People’s Re-
public of China developed, produced, and 
tested an arsenal of an estimated 200 inter-
mediate-range, 150 medium-range, 250 short- 
range, and 54 ground-launched ballistic mis-
siles: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that any international arms control agree-
ment entered into by the United States that 
limits the number of allowable nuclear-capa-
ble missiles must— 
(1) be subject to the advice and consent of 
the Senate; and 
(2) include the Russian Federation and the 
People’s Republic of China.

the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 252 
Whereas antisemitism remains a serious 
and growing danger for Jews in the United 
States and around the world; 
Whereas, in May 2021, antisemitic inci-
dents and rhetoric have surged in the United 
States and around the world as hostilities 
between Hamas and Israel escalated; 
Whereas, since the beginning of 2021, there 
has been an increase in acts of antisemitism, 
including— 
(1) individuals in London calling for Jewish 
‘‘daughters to be raped’’; 
(2) a German synagogue being pelted with 
rocks; 
(3) an attack on Jewish diners in Los Ange-
les, California; 
(4) fireworks hurled at a crowd in New 
York City, New York; 
(5) synagogues in Tucson, Arizona, and 
Skokie, Illinois, being vandalized; 
(6) 
Pakistan’s 
Foreign 
Minister 
Shah 
Mahmood Qureshi’s claim in an interview 
that Israel ‘‘controls the media’’ and has 
‘‘deep pockets,’’ perpetuating an antisemitic 
conspiracy theory; and 
(7) 
Turkey’s 
President 
Recep 
Tayyip 
Erdogan’s invocation of the blood libel myth, 
which has historically been used to justify 
violence against Jews; 
Whereas such antisemitic incidents are 
part of a broader increase in the number and 
intensity of antisemitic incidents in the 
United States and around the world, as evi-
denced by— 
(1) studies by the Kantor Center for the 
Study of Contemporary European Jewry, 
finding that violent antisemitic attacks 
worldwide rose 18 percent in 2019 and shifted 
online in 2020 during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, which resulted in antisemitic con-
spiracy theories related to the pandemic pro-
liferating; and 
(2) hate crime statistics collected by the 
Federal 
Bureau 
of 
Investigation, 
dem-
onstrating— 
(A) a 14 percent increase in antisemitic 
hate crimes in the United States in 2019; 
and 
(B) that Jewish Americans were the tar-
get of 60.2 percent of all religiously moti-
vated hate crimes in 2019, despite account-
ing for 2 percent of the population of the 
United States; 
Whereas Holocaust denial and distortion, 
including intentional efforts to excuse or 
minimize the impact of the Holocaust, dis-
honors those who were persecuted and mur-
dered and reinforces the need for advancing 
accurate Holocaust education globally; 
Whereas over the course of the past decade, 
Holocaust distortion has grown in intensity;

Whereas protecting the history of the Hol-
ocaust and recognizing and confronting Hol-
ocaust denial and distortion is critical to 
preventing antisemitism; 
Whereas Jewish houses of worship are in-
creasingly targets of violent attacks in the 
United States, as evidenced by the deadly as-
saults on synagogues in Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vania, in 2018 and Poway, California, in 2019; 
Whereas, in October 2020, the Department 
of Homeland Security warned that ‘‘racially 
and ethnically motivated violent extrem-
ists—specifically white supremacist extrem-
ists—will remain the most persistent and le-
thal threat in the [United States] Home-
land’’; 
Whereas the Nonprofit Security Grant Pro-
gram of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity provides critical funding to support 
physical security enhancements to Jewish 
organizations and institutions, including 
synagogues, that are at high risk of a ter-
rorist attack or targeted violence; 
Whereas the United States has played a 
crucial leadership role in combating anti-
semitism 
internationally, 
including 
by 
working to promote Holocaust education, 
improve the safety and security of at-risk 
Jewish 
communities, 
combat 
online 
radicalization, ensure foreign public officials 
and faith leaders condemn antisemitic dis-
course, and strengthen foreign judicial sys-
tems in their prosecution of antisemitic inci-
dents; 
Whereas section 59 of the State Depart-
ment Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 
2731) establishes the Office to Monitor and 
Combat Anti-Semitism of the Department of 
State, which is headed by an individual who 
has the rank of ambassador and reports di-
rectly to the Secretary of State, to develop 
and implement policies and projects to com-
bat global antisemitism by working closely 
with 
foreign 
governments, 
intergovern-
mental organizations, and civil society; and 
Whereas the Never Again Education Act 
(36 U.S.C. 2301 note; Public Law 116–141), 
which was signed into law on May 29, 2020, 
expands United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum education programming, requires 
the museum to develop and nationally dis-
seminate accurate, relevant, and accessible 
resources to improve awareness and under-
standing of the Holocaust, and authorizes 
various Holocaust education program activi-
ties to engage prospective and current teach-
ers and educational leaders: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) unequivocally condemns the recent rise 
in antisemitic violence and harassment tar-
geting Jewish Americans, and stands in soli-
darity with those affected by antisemitism; 
(2) recommits to combating antisemitism 
in all forms; 
(3) calls on elected officials, faith leaders, 
and civil society leaders to denounce and 
combat all manifestations of antisemitism; 
(4) urges the President to— 
(A) continue the leadership role of the 
United States in combating antisemitism 
internationally, including by nominating a 
qualified Ambassador to Monitor and Com-
bat Antisemitism and engaging intergovern-
mental organizations to ensure that the 
anti-discrimination efforts of the organiza-
tions include combating antisemitism; 
(B) advance accurate Holocaust education 
and counter Holocaust denial and distortion, 
including by fully implementing the Never 
Again Education Act (36 U.S.C. 2301 note; 
Public Law 116–141); 
(C) ensure the physical security of Jewish 
institutions and organizations, including by 
requesting sufficient resources for the Non-
profit Security Grant Program of the De-
partment of Homeland Security to keep at- 
risk houses of worship, schools, and commu-
nity centers safe from terrorist attacks and 
other forms of antisemitic violence; and 
(D) produce an analysis that accounts for 
the level and scope of the threat that anti-
semitism poses to the people of the United 
States; and 
(5) urges Federal, State, local, and Tribal 
law enforcement agencies to fully partici-
pate in the data collection process of the

PORTING THE DESIGNATION OF 
MAY 2021 AS ‘‘NATIONAL CANCER 
RESEARCH MONTH’’ 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. 
CAPITO, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mrs. HYDE- 
SMITH, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr. SCOTT of 
Florida, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. CRAMER, 
and Mr. ROUNDS) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 253 
Whereas, in 2021, in the United States— 
(1) cancer remains one of the most pressing 
public health concerns; 
(2) an estimated 1,898,160 individuals are 
expected to be diagnosed with cancer; and 
(3) an estimated 608,570 individuals are ex-
pected to die from cancer; 
Whereas 39 percent of men and women will 
be diagnosed with cancer during their life-
time; 
Whereas cancer in the United States— 
(1) as of the date of adoption of this resolu-
tion, is the second most common cause of 
disease-related death; and 
(2) may become the primary cause of dis-
ease-related death; 
Whereas the incidence of cancer is ex-
pected 
to 
grow 
significantly, 
reaching 
2,300,000 cases per year by 2030; 
Whereas racial and ethnic minorities, as 
well as low-income, rural, and elderly popu-
lations, continue to suffer disproportionately 
in cancer incidence, prevalence, and mor-
tality; 
Whereas the term ‘‘cancer’’ refers to more 
than 100 diseases that collectively represent, 
in the United States— 
(1) the leading cause of death for individ-
uals under the age of 85; 
(2) the second leading cause of death for all 
individuals; and 
(3) the leading cause of disease-related 
death among children ages 1 to 14; 
Whereas the most recent projection indi-
cates that the overall cancer-attributed 
costs to the United States would increase 
more than 30 percent between 2015 and 2030 
to a cost of more than $245,000,000,000; 
Whereas the investment the United States 
has made in cancer research has— 
(1) yielded substantial advances in cancer 
research and cancer treatment; and 
(2) has saved and improved millions of 
lives; 
Whereas advancements in understanding 
the causes, mechanisms, diagnoses, treat-
ment, and prevention of cancer have— 
(1) led to cures for many types of cancer; 
and 
(2) converted other, non-curable types of 
cancer into manageable chronic conditions; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for all 
types of cancer was more than 67 percent be-
tween 2011 and 2017; 
Whereas more than 16,900,000 survivors of 
cancer were living in the United States in 
2019; 
Whereas therapies and effective screening 
tools for some types of cancer remain elu-
sive, and some cancers, including pancreatic, 
liver, lung, ovarian, and brain cancer, con-
tinue to have— 
(1) extraordinarily high mortality rates; 
and 
(2) 5-year survival rates, for all stages of 
cancer combined, that are typically less than 
50 percent; 
Whereas partnerships among research sci-
entists, the general public, survivors of can-
cer, patient advocates, philanthropic organi-
zations, industry, and Federal, State, and 
local governments have led to advanced 
breakthroughs for patients with cancer, in-
cluding early detection tools that have in-
creased survival rates and a better quality of 
life for survivors of cancer; 
Whereas precision medicine holds great 
promise in treating many forms of cancer; 
Whereas researchers have learned a sub-
stantial amount about cancer diagnoses, 
treatment, and prevention from the 8 per-
cent of patients who enroll in clinical trials; 
Whereas clinical trials are a key part of 
medical research, and inclusive clinical 
trials with diverse participation among gen-
der, racial, and ethnic populations— 
(1) are important in achieving a com-
prehensive analysis of cancer; and 
(2) lead to more effective treatments that 
improve health outcomes and reduce health 
disparities; 
Whereas advances in cancer research have 
had significant implications for the develop-
ment of COVID–19 vaccines and the treat-
ment of other costly diseases, such as arthri-
tis, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and 
HIV/AIDS; 
Whereas 2021 marks the 50th anniversary of 
the National Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law 
92–218; 85 Stat. 778), which created the Na-
tional Cancer Program and strengthened the 
National Cancer Institute (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘NCI’’) in leading the mis-
sion of the United States to conquer cancer; 
and 
Whereas the NCI— 
(1) serves as an incubator for preeminent 
cancer researchers; 
(2) has created 71 NCI-designated cancer 
centers; and 
(3) awards research grants for projects that 
will lead to innovative treatments and 
groundbreaking cures: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 2021 as 
‘‘National Cancer Research Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the importance of cancer re-
search and the invaluable contributions of 
cancer researchers in the United States and 
around the world who are dedicated to the 
conquest of eliminating cancer; and 
(3) continues to support cancer research as 
a national and international priority to 
eventually eliminate the more than 100 dis-
eases that are referred to as cancer.
