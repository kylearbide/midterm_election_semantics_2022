TAKING ON PANDEMIC AND WAR 
PROFITEERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, our 
economy is still recovering from 2 
years of a once-in-a-generation pan-
demic that basically shut down our 
economy. 
As Americans stopped going out and 
spending money, companies slowed pro-
duction not only to meet this change 
in demand but also to allow for social 
distancing and COVID safety protocols 
for workers. 
Now, as Americans have started to 
resume their normal lives, companies 
are struggling to keep up with the in-
creased demand for goods. These supply 
chain issues and a worker shortage has 
resulted in higher prices across the 
economy. 
These issues do not fully explain 
some of the skyrocketing prices that 
we are seeing. The pandemic, and the 
ensuing recovery, have laid bare sys-
temic problems in our economy, in-
cluding market consolidation and price 
gouging. 
As our economy works to recover 
from the pandemic and the shocks to 
our supply chain, and as the world re-
sponds to Putin’s reckless invasion of 
Ukraine, food and energy costs have 
skyrocketed for people around the 
world, including here in America and 
including in my district in Rhode Is-
land. 
While President Biden has taken a 
number of steps to tackle costs for 
Americans, including releasing mil-
lions of barrels of petroleum from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, expand-
ing access to gasoline with 15 percent 
ethanol, and additional investments in 
the Low Income Home Energy Assist-
ance Program to help those most in 
need, systemic imbalances in our econ-
omy are enabling companies to further 
drive up costs. 
Put simply, they are taking advan-
tage of hardworking Americans and 
raising prices just because they can, all 
for the sake of extraordinary profits. 
As Americans are working to recover 
from 2 years of an unprecedented 
health crisis and the economic down-
turn it caused, companies are reporting 
record profits as worker pay remains 
stagnant and families feel the squeeze 
on their pocketbooks. 
This is especially true in the case of 
gas prices. Exxon, for example, is re-
porting that in the first quarter of 2022, 
its net profits have more than doubled, 
to $5.5 billion, compared to last year. 
Chevron has reported its highest quar-
terly profit in nearly a decade. 
These record profits are a direct re-
sult of record gas prices. If these prices 
were solely based on inflation or supply 
chain issues, these companies wouldn’t 
be seeing these obscene increases in 
profits. 
To make matters worse, these record 
profits aren’t being invested in new 
drilling sites to help us deal with en-
ergy shortages brought on by Putin’s 
invasion of Ukraine but, instead, are 
going 
to 
massive 
company 
stock 
buybacks, shareholder dividends, and 
salary bonuses. This is pandemic war 
profiteering. 
In grocery stores across America, the 
cost of food continues to rise as prices 
for goods like pork, chicken, and beef 
have spiked dramatically. While some 
may point solely to inflation for these 
increased prices, there is, once again, a 
larger systemic problem. 
In the meatpacking industry, for ex-
ample, the top four companies are esti-
mated to control up to 85 percent of 
the industry. In industries all across 
the economy, the story is the same. 
Three firms control 93 percent of the 
soft drink industry. Three firms con-
trol 85 percent of the baby formula in-
dustry. Three firms control 93 percent 
of the baby food industry. Four firms 
control 79 percent of the beer industry. 
Three firms control 79 percent of the 
dry pasta industry. And three firms 
control 73 percent of the cereal indus-
try. 
If history has taught us anything, 
this kind of market consolidation 
hurts product quality, market competi-
tion, and worker safety, all the things 
we need to have an equitable economy. 
As simply put by President Biden: 
‘‘Capitalism without competition is ex-
ploitation.’’ 
So, as we look to recover from this 
pandemic, and in a way that creates an

economy that works for everyone, for 
the people of this country, we need to 
hold these monopolistic giants ac-
countable. 
To start, Congress must pass the Big 
Oil windfall profits tax. Companies 
that have taken advantage of this mo-
ment and taken advantage of the 
American people in a time of crisis 
shouldn’t be raking in record profits. 
Those profits should be returned to the 
consumers that they gouged. 
We also should pass H.R. 7688 to be 
sure that we are taking on, in a serious 
way, price gouging in the energy sec-
tor. I am working with Congresswoman 
SCHAKOWSKY on an economywide anti- 
price gouging bill. 
We need to be sure that we are fund-
ing the FTC to do this work so it can 
conduct rigorous investigations and 
look carefully at this kind of market 
consolidation. 
But look, this is about corporate 
greed, about people taking advantage 
of this moment. As the American peo-
ple are recovering from a very difficult 
couple of years, we should not, in addi-
tion to that, allow them to be victims 
of this kind of price gouging. We have 
the ability to do something about it. 
We have bills that I hope we will 
bring to the floor. Return what was im-
properly taken from consumers at the 
gas pump. Return it back to them. 
I also thank President Biden for the 
work that he is doing to bring down gas 
prices, to focus relentlessly on infla-
tion, both for food and gas. This is the 
number one concern of my constituents 
in Rhode Island, and it will remain the 
number one concern in the weeks 
ahead as we do something to be sure 
that we are taking on these profiteers, 
the pandemic profiteers and war profit-
eers.

CELEBRATING NATIONAL NURSES 
WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. TONY GONZALES) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate National Nurses Week. We all 
know a nurse who has helped us 
throughout our time in life, and I am 
no different. 
My story starts with my grandfather. 
He had an eighth-grade education. He 
was a rancher. When his country 
called, he proudly served in World War 
II. He came home and became a civil 
servant at Kelly Air Force Base. 
He went off to raise seven beautiful 
children. One of those was my aunt, 
who became a nurse. And I have two 
cousins, Natalie and Sandy, who are 
nurses. 
But the story for me is much more 
personal than that. Ten days from now 
will be my 3-year anniversary of life. I 
went into BAMC medical facility for a 
routine procedure. I was intubated in-
correctly. I coded. I had brain trauma. 
I had kidney failure. I was in a coma 
for 3 days. I was in the hospital for 23 
days. 
I praise God that those nurses at 
BAMC brought me back to life. In par-
ticular, 
there 
were 
three 
nurses: 
Monica, Alyssa, and Jenna. Alyssa was 
my day nurse. She is the one who kept 
me alive in the daytime. Jenna kept 
me alive at night. Without nurses, I 
wouldn’t be here. 
Many of us have similar stories. 
Many of us know of similar stories. 
In this institution, we lose sight 
sometimes of the everyday people who 
roll up their sleeves and go to work and 
make this country better. This par-
tisanship that divides this country 
does not happen in the nursing world. 
Nurses don’t care who you voted for. 
They don’t care about the color of your 
skin. They don’t care who you pray to. 
They care about life and protecting 
life, all the opportunities for a great 
quality of life. 
I am grateful to all the nurses out 
there, particularly those serving at 
BAMC.

RECOGNIZING CODY ROUGE 
COMMUNITY ACTION ALLIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Cody Rouge 
Community Action Alliance for their 
outstanding service on behalf of our 
communities across Michigan’s 13th 
District. They are celebrating their 15- 
year anniversary. 
The Cody Rouge Community Action 
Alliance was founded to serve the needs 
and goals of the neighborhood resi-
dents, 
businesses, 
and 
community- 
based organizations. They have worked 
so tirelessly to create pathways to 
greater community engagement, to 
build future leaders through its youth 
programming, and to create a better 
quality of life for all of our residents. 
Cody Rouge Community Action Alli-
ance has been able to successfully con-
nect thousands of residents to critical 
resources, especially during this pan-
demic. We have super supported this 
organization and continue to welcome 
them as they continue to expand to do 
more. 
The alliance, as many know, includes 
a multitude of instrumental churches 
and various faith leaders, as well as 
neighborhood organizations and asso-
ciations. 
Please join me in recognizing the nu-
merous 
contributions 
of 
the 
Cody 
Rouge Community Action Alliance on 
behalf 
of 
Michigan’s 
13th 
District 
Strong. 
HONORING ROSA PARKS 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I stand 
here today to celebrate the passage in 
this Chamber, the House of Representa-
tives, of our bill, H.R. 6614, to honor 
the mother of the civil rights move-
ment and the beloved resident of the 
13th 
Congressional 
District, 
Rosa 
Parks. 
I am proud to lead this effort, in 
partnership with her family, to rename 
a United States Post Office near her 
Detroit home after this incredible lead-
er. This comes at a time when the rad-
ical love and beautiful strength em-
bodied in leaders like Rosa Louise 
Parks and so many others whose foot-
steps we march in today, like Dr. King, 
Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, Congress-
men Cummings and John Lewis, is 
really under extreme attack. We can’t 
allow any of our beloved civil rights 
leaders to be erased. 
We know our struggle against racism 
is a lifelong pursuit. As mother Rosa 
Parks would say, and she wrote: ‘‘Free-
dom fighters never retire.’’ As her 
memory continues to guide us, I will 
add that the spirit of freedom fighters 
never dies. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to 
please pass this bill, H.R. 6614. 
THEY WILL NOT SILENCE US 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition of the simply dra-
conian efforts to overturn the historic, 
landmark decision of Roe v. Wade and 
express disappointment in the failure 
of the Senate to codify Roe. 
Without widespread access to abor-
tion care, millions of women in our 
communities all across our country 
will be deprived of their human rights, 
especially those pertaining to privacy. 
By no means is an abortion an easy 
choice, but it should be a guaranteed 
right within our healthcare system to 
prevent unnecessary trauma for our 
women across our country. 
It is truly disappointing to see efforts 
of those that claim they are pro-life 
but do not pass the child tax credit ex-
pansion, or don’t support the End Child 
Poverty Act, or don’t address the in-
fant mortality crisis in our country. If 
they truly cared, they would be work-
ing on those issues. 
No matter how much others want to 
silence us, I remind women across the 
country that we will not be silent. We 
will continue to fight, from the streets 
of our communities in our districts, to 
keep voicing our opposition, to right 
here in the Halls of Congress. 
We are with you. We are going to 
continue to fight. Again, they will not 
silence us.

CONGRATULATING JOHNSON 
KNIGHTS BOYS SOCCER TEAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the 2022 Georgia 
High School Association 5A State 
champions, the Johnson Knights boys 
soccer team. 
Last week, the Knights appeared in 
their fifth finals since 2014 and earned 
their second State championship. 
After having a player sustain an in-
jury that took him out of the game, 
and then trailing behind in the second 
half, the Knights focused on the re-
maining time they had and turned the 
game around.

HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor our brave men and 
women in blue. 
Our Nation is blessed with heroic law 
enforcement officers who pursue a 
thankless career dedicated to main-
taining law and order, keeping our 
communities safe, and answering the 
call when criminals strike. 
Law enforcement officers are heroes 
in our communities. They are the he-
roes that are desperately needed, but 
they don’t often receive the recogni-
tion that they deserve. 
This week, National Police Week, we 
honor our local, State, and Federal law 
enforcement officers. As far as I am 
concerned, every week should be Na-
tional Police Week. These men and 
women always deserve gratitude for 
their service and sacrifice. 
Yet, law enforcement officers nation-
wide are facing increasingly chal-
lenging conditions, forcing many to 
leave the force and causing others to 
avoid it altogether, leaving police de-
partments across the country strug-
gling to keep staff and fill vacant posi-
tions. 
The horrendous conditions that are 
generating the low morale are sky-
rocketing crime rates, rising attacks 
on law enforcement, and growing calls 
from the left to advance soft-on-crime 
agendas. 
b 1015 
In fact, last year alone, a record 
breaking 73 police officers were trag-
ically killed in the line of duty. As of 
this month, 123 have already been shot 
in 2022, including 19 murdered by crimi-
nals. 
Unfortunately, in Georgia’s Ninth 
District they know horrific reality all 
too well. Back in November of last 
year, my home county, Jackson Coun-
ty, lost both a mother and a heroic law 
enforcement officer, Deputy Lena Mar-
shall. After responding to a domestic 
call that escalated to a violent shoot-
out, Deputy Marshall’s life was taken 
while serving to keep Georgians safe. 
Make no mistake, this attack—and 
any attack of criminal violence toward 
law enforcement—is an assault on jus-
tice. 
Despite the radical left’s persistent 
efforts to disarm, demonize, and defund 
the police, policies that weaken law en-
forcement simply empower criminals, 
worsening the ongoing crime crisis. 
In contrast, I remain dedicated to 
providing our law enforcement officers 
with the community support, the re-
sources, and the political backing 
needed to address surging crime across 
the country. 
Undermining the authority of the he-
roes that protect and serve is des-
picable, which is why we continue the 
fight to ensure that all law enforce-
ment officers are fully equipped in 
their mission to keep our community 
safe. 
May God bless all the men and 
women in blue who willingly put their 
lives on the line for ours, and may we 
honor all of the fallen officers who 
made the ultimate sacrifice in the line 
of duty. May God bless all of the loved 
ones of current, fallen, and future law 
enforcement officers who provide tre-
mendous support both on and off duty. 
We thank you and we honor you for 
your selfless service. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
STANTON). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
DEMINGS) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, in 1962, 
President Kennedy proclaimed May 15 
as National Peace Officers Memorial 
Day, and the week of May 15 as Na-
tional Police Week. Established in 1962 
by a joint resolution of this body, Na-
tional Police Week pays special rec-
ognition to law enforcement officers 
who lost their lives in the line of duty. 
Last year, in my home State of Flor-
ida, we lost 51 law enforcement offi-
cers. I pause to honor them today. I 
was sworn in as a police officer in 1984. 
I shall never forget my oath or the in-
describable feeling of being a police of-
ficer. Police officers do it all: they 
coach little league baseball, football, 
basketball, they deliver meals to sen-
iors, mentor teens, and buy teddy bears 
for abused and neglected children. We 
also know they run to murders, rapes, 
robberies, burglaries, and other vicious 
assaults, including domestic violence 
calls. They respond, without hesi-
tation, hoping and praying for a peace-
ful resolution, but never really know-
ing what the outcome will be. 
This year, 617 new names will be 
added to the memorial wall, fallen offi-
cers who lost their lives through vio-
lence, crashes, assaults. There were 439 
officers that lost their lives to COVID– 
19 while doing everything they could to 
protect and serve their communities. 
Representing central Florida, I will 
take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to re-
member my brother, Orange County 
Deputy First Class Craig Seijos. Every 
day Deputy Seijos went to work, 
‘‘Making a Difference’’, serving the Or-
ange County Sheriff’s Office and the 
citizens of Orange County, Florida, for 
30 years. He is gone but will never be 
forgotten. 
The 
62 
law 
enforcement 
officers 
added to the memorial wall this year 
lost their lives through gunfire. As the 
36th chief of police of the Orlando Po-
lice Department, I would like to tell 
you about one of them, Officer Kevin 
Valencia. 
On June 11 of 2018, Officer Valencia 
responded to a domestic violence call 
involving a convicted felon holding a 
woman and four children at gunpoint. 
While attempting to rescue those chil-
dren, the gunman shot through the 
door critically injuring Kevin. 
Kevin fought hard but succumbed to 
his injuries last year. Kevin Valencia, 
only 29 years of age, was a good police 
officer, one full of courage, full of 
pride, and commitment. Officer Valen-
cia is gone, but he will never be forgot-
ten. 
Mr. Speaker, as we honor these men 
and women for their service, we here in 
this body—the same one in 1962 who 
passed the joint resolution—have an 
obligation to continue to support legis-
lation that will help keep our law en-
forcement officers safe and will give 
them the tools needed to perform the 
tough job, the dangerous job that they 
do every day. 
Protectors, 
guardians—when 
they 
need to be—warriors—when they need 
to be—public servants, America law en-
forcement officers, my brothers and 
sisters in blue, many have given much. 
These officers whose names appear on 
the memorial wall have given all. Let’s 
honor their memories, their service, 
their sacrifice.

HONORING NASCC EXCELLENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate 
the men and women of Naval Air Sta-
tion Corpus Christi for taking first 
place in the U.S. Navy’s Installation 
Excellence Award. 
Awarded by the Commander of Naval 
Installations Command, this achieve-
ment rightfully recognizes Naval Air 
Station Corpus Christi for superior per-
formance, 
installation 
management, 
program excellence, and community 
outreach. 
This honor is a true testament to the 
hard work and devotion to mission suc-
cess that is put forth daily by so many. 
Residing along the Corpus Christi 
Bay, Naval Air Station Corpus Christi 
has been home to naval pilot training 
since 1941. Along with producing the 
finest naval aviators in the world, 
Naval 
Air 
Station 
Corpus 
Christi 
serves as a major hub or naval activity 
in south Texas. 
From the newest graduates arriving 
from recruit training to the installa-
tion’s commander, Christopher Jason, I 
have witnessed professionalism and 
dedication of the individuals who have 
earned this distinction. 
I thank everyone stationed at NAS 
Corpus Christi for their service and ex-
tend my congratulations to NAS Cor-
pus Christi on this achievement. 
I wish Captain Jason the best as he 
represents the U.S. Navy in competi-
tion for the 2022 Commander in Chiefs 
Award for Installation Excellence, and 
I look forward to the NAS Corpus 
Christi’s 
continued 
excellence 
and 
achievement, and couldn’t be prouder

HONORING ROCKPORT MAYOR PATRICK ‘‘PAT’’ 
RIOS 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor a pillar of our commu-
nity, Mayor Patrick ‘‘Pat’’ Rios of 
Rockport, Texas. Pat has led the city 
of Rockport as the mayor for the past 
4 years and his term ends this month. 
This position was the culmination of 
his decade-long elected public service, 
where he previously served as Ward 3 
council member and mayor pro tem 
from 2012 to 2018. Before public service, 
Pat was an entrepreneur and small 
business owner. He eventually entered 
the healthcare industry and rose to 
senior levels before his retirement in 
2010. 
Anyone who has met him knows Pat 
is a fierce advocate for the city of 
Rockport. This was evident from the 
moment he took the helm in his role as 
mayor; a moment that was character-
ized by Hurricane Harvey’s havoc and 
devastation in 2017. 
The hurricane made landfall along 
the Charm of the Texas Coast. Under 
Pat’s leadership, the city that was first 
hit aggressively moved forward with 
the ‘‘first to recover’’ mantra that 
speaks to the heart of the resolute 
Texas spirit. 
Due to Pat, the city has made re-
markable progress in rebuilding and is 
poised to be stronger than ever. Pat is 
a shining example of community lead-
ership and stewardship. I have greatly 
enjoyed working with him, especially 
in this recovery effort during his ten-
ure as mayor, and I wish him and his 
wife, Patricia Ann, and his entire fam-
ily the best during his well-deserved re-
tirement from public service. 
HONORING WORLD WAR II AND KOREAN WAR 
VETERAN LUIS A. VALLS 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Luis Angel 
Valls of Corpus Christi, Texas. Born in 
1928 in Sinton, Texas, and raised in 
Alice, Luis answered the Nation’s call 
by enlisting in the United States Navy 
during World War II. 
At the age of 17, he was sent to serv-
ice in the Pacific Theater. With the 
onset of the Korean war, Luis’ over-
whelming sense of duty and selfless 
service saw him answering the Nation’s 
call once more. He served in the Navy 
until he was honorably discharged in 
1954. 
After his Navy service, Luis relo-
cated to Corpus Christi, Texas, and 
joined the Corpus Christi Fire Depart-
ment where he served for 29 years, 
being one of the first Mexican Ameri-
cans to join CCFD. 
During his time with the fire depart-
ment, he was recognized twice for valor 
and has the distinction of making the 
first ambulance call for the CCFD’s 
newly formed EMT ambulance pro-
gram. 
Luis married the love of his life, Olga 
Pena, in 1958 in Alice. Together they 
had four sons and were happily married 
for 64 years. 
Luis was a proud member of the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled 
American Veterans, and the Pan-Amer-
ican Golf Association. He was a loyal 
parishioner of Our Lady of Perpetual 
Help Catholic Church in Corpus Christi 
for over 60 years. 
Luis was an avid golfer, deer hunter, 
and voracious reader of history, includ-
ing military, Western and Texas his-
tory. 
As a proud father and grandfather, 
his greatest joy during retirement was 
spending time with his family. Our Na-
tion is indebted to Mr. Valls. I ask that 
you please join me in honoring and re-
membering his magnificent life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MIGUEL 
GONZALEZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CA´ RDENAS) for 5 min-

Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise

fatal car accident. 
Miguel was one of the founders and 
owners of Vallarta Supermarkets, a 
chain of family-owned grocery stores 
committed to offering the best-quality 
products from Mexico and Latin Amer-
ica. 
Originally 
from 
Jalostotitlan, 
Jalisco, Mexico, he immigrated to the 
San Fernando Valley with his family 
and graduated from Van Nuys High 
School. 
As a young man, Miguel had an eye 
for buildings and design. He pursued 
his passion in architecture after receiv-
ing an associate’s degree in arts. This 
led him to begin a career at Jet Propul-
sion Laboratory in Pasadena, Cali-
fornia, as a quality assurance techni-
cian who worked on parts for the Space 
Shuttle program. 
In 1985, his brother, Enrique, Sr., 
started the family business when he 
opened Carniceria Vallarta in a 1,000- 
square-foot market in Van Nuys, Cali-
fornia. Enrique, Sr. soon expanded the 
business to a second location and got 
his four brothers to join, including 
Miguel. They focused on selling tradi-
tional cuts of popular Mexican meats. 
The brothers would put in 18-hour days, 
7 days a week to make sure the busi-
ness succeeded. 
Miguel brought his passion for design 
and helped develop the significant ar-
chitecture and interior design of the 
Vallarta stores. He created the trade-
mark Vallarta aesthetic with the focus 
of modern and nostalgic references to 
his hometown in Jalisco. 
Anyone in our community can recog-
nize the iconic design when they are 
driving around the neighborhood. When 
they go in they forget they are in Cali-
fornia, and they are taken directly 
back to Mexico. That is what Miguel 
did, he made a simple shopping experi-
ence feel like home. 
He was always pushing the envelope 
to make sure every store completed its 
mission to serve our community with 
respect and pride, while providing au-
thentic, 
traditional, 
fresh 
products 
that bring families together over a 
meal. 
One of his last projects was Sayulita 
Tap Room established in October of 
2020 in Indio, California. This project 
epitomized his vision of spending qual-
ity time with loved ones, excellent food 
and drinks, and live music. 
When he pitched this idea to his fam-
ily, they all had doubts and concerns. 
They asked, ‘‘A bar at a grocery 
store?’’ Miguel said, ‘‘If Whole Foods 
can do it, so can I.’’ This project rep-
resented Miguel’s vision and entrepre-
neurial spirit to make his dreams a re-
ality. 
Miguel wasn’t just a shining example 
of the American Dream, he inspired 
countless others to ‘‘work hard and 
play harder,’’ which was his motto. He 
left a legacy of 52 stores throughout 
southern and central California, all 
which provide jobs to more than 8,000 
hardworking people. 
Miguel had a deep passion and love 
for the employees and families of 
Vallarta Supermarkets. He was heavily 
involved in the Gonzalez Family Foun-
dation, which offers scholarships to its 
employees and their children. 
The foundation has given thousands 
of dollars to help their families pursue 
higher education. 
b 1030 
On top of that, he was a supporter 
and donor to the St. Jude Children’s 
Center. For this and so much more, I 
know that his legacy will continue to 
inspire Latinos and countless others in 
our community and across the country. 
I know that his designs will be seen 
and appreciated by more and more peo-
ple every day. 
Miguel leaves behind his high school 
sweetheart and wife, Maria Teresa; his 
two sons, Christian and Luis Angel; his 
granddaughter, Aria Soleil; his mother, 
Eva; his father, Felix; his brothers; sis-
ters; cousins; aunts; uncles; and many 
of us who are his dear friends. 
Many of Miguel’s family made the 
trip to Washington, D.C., to watch him 
be honored in this body. 
I have had the honor of knowing 
Miguel and his family, admiring his 
wonderful work and his work ethic. 
Miguel came to the United States not 
speaking English. Miguel’s first lan-
guage was Spanish. So with that, I 
honor him and all those who come to 
this country and give so much to the 
United States of America. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
To Miguel’s family, thank you very 
much for giving so much of Miguel to 
the community. 
I would also like to thank Miguel for 
being such a good man, husband, fa-
ther, son, friend. 
It is very important for everyone to 
know that, in the United States of 
America, we are all equal.

Miguel achieved many of his dreams 
and the dreams of thousands and thou-
sands of families, not only those who 
work at Vallarta but also the people 
and community they serve.

friend Miguel Gonzalez.

tleman from California will provide a 
translation of his remarks.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK: 
DARKNESS WILL NEVER WIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, last year there were over 
60,000 police officers who were as-
saulted in the line of duty. Over 60,000 
were assaulted, and 295 of those officers 
died. This year already we have had 
over 123 police officers who have been 
shot. 
This is National Police Week. This is 
the time when we need to reflect upon 
the difference between total chaos in 
our community and civilized order, 
holding people accountable for the 
crimes that they commit, ensuring 
that we are not defunding the police 
but we are lifting up the police, and 
that we are holding these peacekeepers 
and their families in our prayers. 
Mr. Speaker, on July 17 of 2016, we 
had five police officers in my home-
town of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shot. 
Brad Garafola, Matthew Gerald, and 
Montrell Jackson died that day. They 
died. Bruce Simmons and Brad Mont-
gomery were both injured. 
Nick Tullier was an East Baton 
Rouge Parish sheriff’s deputy. Nick 
took three bullets—one to the head, 
one to the chest, and one to the abdo-
men. Every single medical profes-
sional—doctors, nurses, and hospital 
officials—everyone said that he wasn’t 
going to make it through the rest of 
that day, July 17. Nearly 6 years later, 
Nick Tullier was still fighting for his 
life. He sat there for 2,119 days—2,119 
days—with his father, James, and his 
mother, Mary, by his side fighting. 
Nick was unbelievable. 
This shooting was designed to rip our 
community apart. It was designed to 
attack law enforcement, to attack 
peacekeepers, and, I think, to offend 
the police and to intimidate the police. 
It did completely the opposite. Rather 
than ripping our community apart, it 
brought all of us together—all of us— 
together. No matter political party, 
race, 
socioeconomic 
situation, 
or 
neighborhood, everyone came together 
in support of these officers, their fami-
lies, their departments, and what they 
did, their sacrifice. 
These people are underpaid and over-
worked, and every single day when 
they leave the house they kiss loved 
ones and they kiss dependents because 
it may be the last time they come 
home. 
Mr. Speaker, Nick Tullier didn’t let 
the evil win. He didn’t let the bad guys 
win. Nick was completely a fighter. He 
sat there, and against all odds he re-
fused to let death prevail. 
Mr. Speaker, Nick inspired our entire 
community and our State. You saw 
these bracelets all over the place: 
‘‘Pray for Nick Tullier’’ or ‘‘Nick 
Tullier Strong.’’ Even the President 
signed a note to him a few years ago. It 
was a rallying cry for our community. 
Mr. Speaker, the numbers that we 
have seen this year alone in not lifting 
up the police and supporting the po-
lice—supporting these peacekeepers— 
but rather disrespecting them is abso-
lutely inexcusable. 
These people—I can’t say it enough— 
put their lives on the line for our com-
munities so we can be safe. Nick 
Tullier fought, he beat that evil, and 
he defied all odds. But, sadly, on Tues-
day of this week, he was buried after 6 
years of fighting death, of saying no, of 
upholding good, and of bringing our 
community together. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the amazing 
work of his parents again, Mary and 
James Tullier, who every single day 
were at his side making it clear to 
Nick that not just they were there for 
him but the entire community was and 
that their boundless love for this man 
would be so clear to him throughout 
this process. It was so clear. 
I thank his sons, Trenton and Gage. I 
remind them their father was a role 
model for our community. I say to his 
brothers, Jamie and Shannon, please 
don’t let the void that Nick’s passing 
to the Father has created. Do not let 
that become a void here on Earth. Con-
tinue his mission, the Nick Tullier 
Foundation, St. Jude, and others. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want 
to say the difference between chaos and 
order is what our peacekeepers do. Un-
derpaid, underappreciated, and over-
worked, these are great people. We can-
not allow this trend of seeing an in-
crease in shootings. There were over 
60,000 attacks against our law enforce-
ment officers last year alone. We can-
not allow this to continue.

PRIVATE JACOB CRUZ POST 
OFFICE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GOMEZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, Latino 
servicemembers have been vital to the 
defense of our country, including the 
thousands who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice. It is important that our com-
munities and our government pay trib-
ute to the diverse history of Latinos in 
the United States military, which is 
why I am proud that the House passed 
my bill, H.R. 5900, honoring World War 
II 
hero, 
Private 
Jacob 
Cruz, 
an 
Angeleno and Boyle Heights resident, 
and a United States Marine Corps Re-
serve private. 
Private Cruz was 17 years old and a 
junior at Roosevelt High School when 
he asked his single immigrant mother, 
Gracia Cruz, a custodian at White Me-
morial Medical Center, for permission 
to enlist. After initial training, Private 
Cruz shipped off to the Pacific where he 
gave his life running ammunition boxes 
to gunners amid enemy fire during the 
Battle of Tarawa in 1943. 
Private Cruz’s heroic devotion to 
duty posthumously earned him the Sil-
ver Star and the Purple Heart. Unfor-
tunately, his remains were not recov-
ered after he was killed. During a 
storm in 2019, Mother Nature brushed 
away a house where the battle took 
place, and the remains of Mr. Cruz were 
found. In 2020 they were identified, and 
in 2021 they were finally returned to 
Private Cruz’ family for a long-awaited 
proper burial with full military honors. 
In recognition of Private Cruz’ serv-
ice and sacrifice, the House passed H.R. 
5900 designating the Boyle Heights 
Post Office as the Marine Corps Re-
serve Private Jacob Cruz Post Office. 
I take a moment to give thanks to 
Private Cruz’ family, including his 
brother, Isaac; his sister, Ruth; his 
nephews, Mike and Isaac; and his niece, 
Alta, who have kept Private Cruz’ leg-
acy alive in Boyle Heights for almost 
eight decades and never gave up the 
fight to bring him home. 
As we approach Memorial Day, I urge 
the Senate to pass H.R. 5900 to honor 
Private Cruz’ sacrifice and those of 
other Latino military heroes, both fall-
en and alive, in Los Angeles and across 
the country for decades to come. 
Roosevelt High School, where Pri-
vate Cruz attended, has a long history, 
as well as Garfield High School, in giv-
ing up boys to go to fight the World 
Wars. There is a football game called 
the East L.A. Classic between Roo-
sevelt and Garfield. The 4 years during 
World War II were the only years that 
they couldn’t field a team on either 
side. This is an honor of Private Cruz, 
but it is also an honor of all the Latino 
men who gave their lives during our 
conflicts, especially during World War 
II.

TRADE DEFICIT AND MEANS OF 
PRODUCTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the re-
cent numbers on our trade deficit in 
this country tie in strongly with our 
supply chain issues we have been facing 
during COVID and during this new ad-
ministration. We have reached a new 
record of $110 billion for 1 month of 
March of our trade deficits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4868 
May 12, 2022 
So why are we in this precarious sit-
uation? 
We are not producing the way we 
need to in this country. I just spoke 
with some dairy folks a while ago from 
California. They are having more and 
more difficulty in producing but also 
exporting. We are not adhering to our 
trade regulations and our trade agree-
ments. Basically the USTR is saying 
we are not being empowered to make 
new trade agreements, we are instead 
more worried about other things such 
as climate change and things like that. 
How are we supposed to compete? 
How are small towns and small town 
economies supposed to keep going 
when we cannot produce here and we 
cannot have trade agreements that are 
adhered to? 
Under the Trump agreements with 
China we were $300 billion behind be-
cause they were not being enforced. 
How are we supposed to have the 
means of production in this country 
when we don’t enforce our trade laws 
and our trade agreements? 
We have shiploads that come over 
here full of more electronic gadgetry or 
what have you from China and others, 
and then they leave our ports a lot of 
times empty. They don’t even fulfill 
obligations. When they leave the ports 
in southern California they are sup-
posed to stop in the Port of Oakland, 
for example, and pick up our ag prod-
ucts, almonds, et cetera, and take 
them back. Yet they don’t because 
they are not being enforced. 
What does that mean for our econ-
omy? 
It means bad things. Bad things for 
our rural ag economy and bad things 
for our rural trade deficit. So if we 
don’t have the means of production 
here, if we are not sustaining them, 
then we will not have food and we will 
not have the other things that Ameri-
cans produce as part of our trade agree-
ments, and then we will be even more 
dependent on imported food and im-
ported products that have already put 
us over a barrel. 
Somewhere around 90 percent of our 
pharmaceuticals, for example, are pro-
duced in China. 
What if they decide to cut off their 
export to us and keep us over a barrel 
on that? 
How are we supposed to continue to 
compete? 
How are we supposed to have an 
economy? 
We need the President and his U.S. 
trade representatives to adhere to en-
forcing our trade agreements because 
it means so much to our jobs, and it 
means so much to our economy. If they 
are not producing for export, then they 
are probably not going to be around to 
produce for our domestic use. 
So as we see the world food crisis 
mount up—and we haven’t seen any-
thing yet indeed as water is being cut 
off in California, for example, because 
of BOR and others are not finding that 
a priority over fish and over salinity in 
the delta—we are going to find our-
selves in 2023 without the food that we 
should have been growing in 2022. 
It is not that tough. It is pretty sim-
ple. You need to plant a year ahead in 
agriculture and food supply to have 
what you are going to need next year. 
But we don’t because we are after pie- 
in-the-sky other priorities. So elec-
trification of tractors they are talking 
about. No farmer is going to be able to 
change his fleet out and get rid of his 
trucks and his tractors to meet these 
‘‘goals’’ set by somebody in Wash-
ington, D.C., or Sacramento. We need 
to get back to basics. We are coming 
out of 2 years of COVID. We are coming 
out of a timeline where the economy 
has been harmed greatly by over-
bearing COVID regulations and taking 
people out of the production chain. So 
we are all feeling the effects of that— 
unemployment. Yet there are many 
employment opportunities out there, 
and we are not taking advantage of the 
ability to fill them because instead we 
are mailing out $1,200 checks for 
prioritizing other things. 
b 1045 
I just do not understand how we have 
a strong country, a strong economy, 
when we don’t prioritize domestic pro-
duction, keeping the supply chains 
filled. 
We are having difficulty getting rail-
road bookings to move our products 
back and forth between the coast and 
the Midwest to feed ethanol plants in 
California, for example. 
We want this newer, cleaner fuel, and 
we can hardly get the grain there. 
What is going on with that? Why can’t 
we have train track time in order to 
move these very needed products? 
Why are ports so balled up, being on 
the receiving end of imports but not 
being able to get our exports out be-
cause we are not being more forceful on 
our trade agreements? 
How long are we going to keep doing 
this? It makes me wonder if the admin-
istration is actually on the side of the 
American people or other interests. 
We are not going to be in a good way 
as we already suffer higher costs for 
food, empty shelves. We need the Biden 
administration to focus on full shelves 
and not empty shelves.

CELEBRATING DR. BERNARD 
LAFAYETTE JR. DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I proudly 
rise today to join the city of Selma, 
Alabama, in celebrating May 14, 2022, 
as Dr. Bernard LaFayette Jr. Day, hon-
oring the extraordinary contributions 
of civil rights leader, activist, and ad-
vocate of nonviolence Reverend Dr. 
Bernard LaFayette, Jr. 
Dr. LaFayette made his mark in his-
tory as a civil rights organizer, min-
ister, educator, and lecturer whose con-
tributions to the civil rights movement 
have garnered him national recogni-
tion as a leading authority on the 
strategy of nonviolent social change. 
As a student advocate in the 1960s, he 
played a leading role in the early orga-
nizing of the Selma voting rights 
movement. Dr. LaFayette was an ac-
tive participant in the sit-in campaign 
and the Nashville student movement, 
and he worked closely throughout the 
1960s with groups such as the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, 
SNCC, the Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference, SCLC, and the Amer-
ican Friends Service Committee. 
Dr. LaFayette began his activism as 
a student at American Baptist Theo-
logical Seminary in Nashville, Ten-
nessee, where he was taught by teacher 
and SCLC mentor James Lawson the 
techniques of nonviolence. 
Dr. LaFayette learned alongside fel-
low students John Lewis, James Bevel, 
and Diane Nash before participating in 
the Nashville student lunch counter 
sit-ins in the 1960s. 
From there, his passion for civil 
rights continued to blossom, leading 
him to become one of the cofounders of 
SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordi-
nating Committee. 
As a director of SNCC’s Alabama 
voter registration project in 1962, Dr. 
LaFayette relocated to my hometown 
of Selma, Alabama, where he worked 
with the Dallas County Voters League 
to 
open 
voter 
registration 
clinics 
throughout the city of Selma. 
Gaining a reputation as a fiery orga-
nizer and passionate proponent of non-
violence, Dr. LaFayette expanded his 
work from Alabama to Chicago, work-
ing with the American Friends Service 
Committee, Dr. Martin Luther King, 
and the SCLC’s Chicago campaign. 
He later became an ordained Baptist 
minister and served as president of his 
alma mater, the American Baptist 
Theological Seminary. 
Dr. LaFayette is recognized as one of 
the leading proponents of nonviolent 
direct action in the world. He has 
taught and preached the philosophy of 
nonviolence in many colleges and uni-
versities across the globe. 
He was the recipient of numerous 
honorary 
degrees, 
including 
from 
Mount Holyoke College, the University 
of Rhode Island, and Antioch College’s 
Coretta Scott King Center for Cultural 
and Intellectual Freedom. 
Dr. LaFayette has written several 
books about his experience in the civil 
rights movement and books covering 
his views and thoughts on nonviolence. 
These books include ‘‘The Leaders 
Manual: A Structured Guide and Intro-
duction to Kingian Nonviolence,’’ ‘‘The 
Briefing Booklet: An Orientation to 
the Kingian Nonviolence Conflict Rec-
onciliation Program,’’ and most re-
cently, ‘‘In Peace and Freedom: My 
Journey in Selma.’’ 
For over 50 years, Dr. LaFayette has 
remained dedicated to equality and 
justice for all, lecturing at various uni-
versities and traveling internationally 
to train the next generation on how to 
achieve social change using the philos-
ophy of Dr. King and nonviolence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4869 
May 12, 2022 
I ask my colleagues to join me and 
the citizens of the city of Selma and 
Dallas County, Alabama, in declaring 
May 14, 2022, as Dr. Bernard LaFayette 
Jr. Day in celebration of the extraor-
dinary life and legacy of the Reverend 
Dr. Bernard LaFayette, Jr., an Ala-
bama gem and an American treasure. 
f 
NO CONTROL AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. MOORE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I have been here probably about 16 
months now, and I am really getting 
tired of being right on so many issues 
in general, just the things we talk 
about from sort of the right of the po-
litical perspective. 
We warned that if we spent trillions 
and trillions of dollars on COVID that 
we would see inflation as a result. Now, 
the American people are feeling that 
pain. 
We warned that if we shut down the 
Keystone pipeline, and then we had to 
beg OPEC to increase production, we 
would see an increase in prices. We 
continue to see that impact the Amer-
ican families. 
Today, I am here to yield another 
warning, and I hope I am wrong on 
this. I really do. I had an opportunity 
to go down to the border, and I have 
been down a couple of times. One of the 
things that I found very interesting is 
that people coming to this country are 
having to deal with the drug cartels. 
We no longer have operational con-
trol of the southern border, no matter 
what Secretary Mayorkas says. We 
don’t have control of the southern bor-
der. 
What is happening is now we have 
people coming to this country, and 
they have a couple of different options, 
depending on where they are coming 
from. If you are coming from Mexico, 
just south of the border, you can pay 
the drug cartels approximately $4,000 
to $5,000. Those prices, I think, are 
changing gradually. But if you want to 
come from the triangle nations a little 
further south, it will cost you about 
$8,000 to come to America. 
Syria, the last price I heard was 
$20,000. This week, we had a sheriff’s 
department in Texas on a random traf-
fic stop that had two Chinese people 
who they arrested and detained who 
had paid $80,000 each to come to our 
country. 
What do the people do that don’t 
have the money to come to our coun-
try? What do they do? What are the 
policies of Biden’s southern border? 
What do they do? They have a couple of 
options. 
One option is they can become drug 
mules. If you want to pay passage to 
the drug cartels, you have an option. 
You can backpack heroin, fentanyl, or 
cocaine across the U.S. southern border 
to pay for your passage to the Mexican 
drug cartels. 
Now, the thing we need to be re-
minded of is those drugs are not going 
to stay in those border towns. We saw 
that this year. We are losing about one 
person every 5 minutes to fentanyl 
overdoses. We are setting a new record 
level. 
There were a lot of sad mothers on 
Mother’s Day this past Sunday. I 
talked to a physician friend of mine in 
a college town, and she warned me. She 
said, Barry, we are seeing a lot of 
young people who see these drugs on-
line. They might think they are get-
ting Xanax, and they are getting some-
thing laced with fentanyl. 
That is one of the warnings that we 
are issuing here today: The drugs are 
coming to a town near you. 
The other thing that this policy of 
crossing our southern border, this open 
border policy of the Biden administra-
tion, the other thing it is doing is cre-
ating human trafficking. 
We heard a briefing yesterday morn-
ing. What happens now is, used to, they 
would at least separate the child from 
the mother and do an interview to try 
to get to the bottom of: Are these peo-
ple really related, or are these children 
being trafficked into America? 
The Border Patrol agents are so over-
whelmed right now on our southern 
border—the text I heard was ‘‘broken 
arrow,’’ I believe was the term. They 
don’t even interview now. We are put-
ting these children on buses. We don’t 
know what cities we are sending them 
to. 
I remember asking an admiral at 
Fort Bliss: Sir, what are we doing with 
these children? Where are they going? 
He said: Well, we are shipping them to 
addresses. 
My question was: Why don’t we send 
them back to where they came from? 
Now, these are kids who are 14 to 17 
years of age. His response to me was: 
Well, they don’t really have an address 
where they came from. 
You are telling me they lived there 
most of their life, but we are going to 
send them to a Google address in 
America? 
We are creating a crisis in this Na-
tion, and I hope I am wrong, but I am 
afraid I am not. The drugs are coming 
to your community as the left wants to 
defund police. 
These people are making payments. 
Most of this money now, the inden-
tured servants and the human traffic, 
the ones who don’t traffic the drugs 
across in a backpack, they are making 
installment payments to the cartels 
south of the border. Most of the money 
that is being made is being sent south 
of the border. 
We have a ton of statistics here, and 
I don’t want to try to go through this, 
but let me say this: Under this admin-
istration, instead of every 30 years, 
about every 30 to 40 days, we are seeing 
a new historic event, whether it is in-
flation, gas prices, the border crisis, or 
the number of deaths as a result of 
drug overdoses. 
Again, I hope I am wrong on this, but 
let me say this for all of our friends: I 
hope you will go see the border. I would 
encourage the President, the Vice 
President: Please, go see what is going 
on. 
We have an invasion on the southern 
border. We do not have operational 
control anymore of the southern bor-
der. The drug cartels are controlling 
our southern border, and it is esti-
mated that they are going to make 
close to $100 billion on just human traf-
ficking across the border alone. That 
does not count their drug profits. 
We have a crisis on our southern bor-
der, and I will say this: A closed border 
is a compassionate border.

EXTREMELY DANGEROUS 
DECISION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE). The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mrs. 
TRAHAN) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, yes-
terday, our colleagues in the Senate 
held a key vote on legislation to codify 
women’s reproductive rights that have 
been guaranteed under Roe v. Wade for 
the past 50 years. 
Senators had the opportunity to go 
on the record to show their support for 
protecting the health and safety of 
every woman in America. That vote 
failed. 
Madam Speaker, 51 Senators voted 
against the Women’s Health Protection 
Act, joining the 211 House Members 
who, in the wake of the Supreme 
Court’s draft opinion overturning Roe, 
support rolling back women’s rights. 
Madam Speaker, as a woman, I am 
horrified by what has taken place in 
the past week. As a mom, I am terri-
fied for what the future holds for my 
two young girls. 
As a Member of this body, I am infu-
riated by those who will stand here on 
this floor in the people’s House and tell 
women that the rights we have cher-
ished for the past 50 years were a mis-
take, that they should be undone with 
the stroke of a pen. 
Make no mistake: This decision from 
the Supreme Court, or anything re-
motely close to it, is extremely dan-
gerous. For tens of millions of women, 
it will mean losing access to lifesaving 
reproductive health services, and it 
will happen overnight. 
In States like Texas and Alabama, it 
will mean that the victims of rape or 
incest will be forced to carry their 
traumatic, unwanted pregnancies to 
term. 
To my colleagues who support that 
kind of future, I ask you if you can face 
your mother and explain to her why, if 
you can look at your daughter or your 
granddaughter in the eyes and say that 
she doesn’t deserve the same rights as 
her brothers or her male classmates. 
Over the past week, I have heard 
those who support Judge Alito’s draft 
opinion in my home State say that we 
live in Massachusetts, so we don’t have 
anything to worry about. However, 
that stance is flawed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4870 
May 12, 2022 
Yes, women in Massachusetts and 
other States that have done the right 
thing by codifying Roe will be safe, but 
for how long? Anti-choice activists and 
elected officials across the country, in-
cluding many in this Chamber, have 
made it clear that they want to ban 
every woman in America from access-
ing abortion care. 
They don’t care about States’ rights. 
They want to override State laws that 
protect our reproductive rights because 
they want to eliminate our ability to 
control our own bodies. 
Well, I have news for those folks. His-
tory has shown us, with brutal clarity, 
that you will never ban abortions. You 
will just ban the safe ones. 
Women, particularly women of color 
and 
those 
from 
low-income 
back-
grounds, will be forced into the alleys 
for their abortion care. Many women 
will die from unsafe procedures. 
While families mourn an empty seat 
at the dinner table, the wealthiest in 
America, including many who cheered 
on Judge Alito, will find ways to access 
that same care. But they will do it in 
secret to avoid the prosecution they 
want for others and the display of their 
own hypocrisy. 
b 1100 
That is not the America I want my 
girls to grow up in. It is not the coun-
try I want for any of our daughters to 
grow up in. 
So I urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to stop thinking about 
the political ramifications of sup-
porting women and to start thinking 
about what could happen to the women 
in your own life if you succeed. 
There is still time to do the right 
thing. So join us, or at the very least, 
get out of our way. Our daughters are 
depending on us.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
PRIN-
CIPLES OF ENGINEERING STU-
DENTS AT PELLA HIGH SCHOOL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the ac-
complishments of some outstanding 
students in my district. 
Recently, the Principles of Engineer-
ing Class at Pella High School won the 
high school division of the Build Iowa’s 
Future Design Challenge. This design 
challenge asks students to create inno-
vative projects to improve their com-
munity. 
Pella is the home of some global, 
worldwide excellent manufacturing fa-
cilities, such as Pella windows and 
Vermeer manufacturing, so the stu-
dents drew inspiration from their own 
hometown. 
The class designed an advanced man-
ufacturing lab to be created at the Ca-
reer Academy of Pella to provide expe-
riences and opportunities for students 
looking to pursue a career in manufac-
turing. 
Congratulations 
to 
Isaac, 
Crista, 
Jack, 
Stephen, 
Kaysar, 
Emmalee, 
Grace, Wyatt, and Jackson on the win. 
I am thrilled to acknowledge these 
high school students and to see them 
introduce innovative solutions to the 
growing field of manufacturing, and I 
am excited to see these students be-
come leaders of tomorrow. 
Recognizing Sarah Watson 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Sarah Watson. 
Sarah is a University of Iowa grad-
uate, where she was editor of the stu-
dent-run newspaper, The Daily Iowan. 
Sarah took her talents to Quad-City 
Times following graduation where she 
reports on politics and elections. 
During Sarah’s time at Quad-City 
Times, she has reported on pertinent 
veterans’ issues and the full breakdown 
of legislation introduced at the local, 
State, and Federal levels. 
Sarah’s commitment to journalism 
has not gone unnoticed. Recently, 
Sarah was awarded the Jay P. Wagner 
Prize for Young Journalists by the 
Iowa 
Newspaper 
Association. 
This 
award is dedicated to the late Jay P. 
Wagner, an Iowa newspaper reporter 
and editor who had a passion for en-
couraging young reporters to report on 
local 
communities. 
This 
award 
is 
awarded to journalists 30 years old or 
younger who display a deep passion and 
love for Iowa and its people. 
I can think of no person more deserv-
ing of this award than Sarah. Her drive 
to inform the community on issues and 
topics in their government is un-
matched, and I am proud to have jour-
nalists like her reporting on issues in 
my district. 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO JOSEPH AND MATTHEW 
MARTINO 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I would also like to take a 
minute to recognize the birthday of my 
nephews, Joseph and Matthew Martino. 
Happy birthday to Joseph and Mat-
thew.

REMEMBERING WALTER MONDALE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. MURPHY) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, the memorial service for 
former Vice President Walter Mondale 
was held last week. 
Unbeknownst to him, Mondale had a 
major impact on my life and on the 
lives of other refugees fleeing violence 
and oppression in Southeast Asia. The 
moral courage he displayed then should 
influence and inspire world leaders now 
as we confront a new refugee crisis 
spawned 
by 
Russia’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. 
The Carter-Mondale administration 
took office in 1977 in the aftermath of 
the end of the U.S. involvement in the 
Vietnam war. Because my parents had 
worked with American and South Viet-
namese forces during the war, they 
faced persecution by the communist 
government that had taken over. 
In 1979, we were finally able to escape 
by boat. Unfortunately for us, we ran 
out of fuel in international waters. 
But, fortunately, a U.S. Navy ship re-
sponded to our distress call, and the 
sailors gave us the fuel and supplies we 
needed to reach a Malaysian refugee 
camp. We were the beneficiaries of 
American power and generosity. 
My family’s physical journey from 
Vietnam to America and our emotional 
journey from darkness to light was 
only possible because of policy deci-
sions made by this Nation’s leaders. 
After 
Saigon 
fell 
to 
communist 
forces in 1975, President Ford per-
mitted about 130,000 South Vietnamese 
citizens into the United States. But 
after that, America’s gates were essen-
tially closed to refugees from South-
east Asia, even though the situation on 
the ground continued to deteriorate. 
Former U.S. allies were being sent to 
what was called reeducation camps. 
They 
were 
essentially 
hard 
labor 
camps, and many of them didn’t sur-
vive. 
When Carter and Mondale entered 
the White House, many Vietnamese 
families, including mine, were taking 
their chances on the high seas. We were 
collectively known as the Vietnamese 
boat people. There was debate within 
the U.S. Government about what to do. 
Some policymakers thought America 
had done enough. Others believed this 
country could do more. Carter and 
Mondale ultimately sided with the ad-
vocates for additional action, even 
though the weight of public opinion 
was against them. 
Mondale chaired a meeting during 
which he grew impatient with officials 
from the Defense and State depart-
ments. ‘‘Are you telling me that we 
have thousands of people drowning in 
the open sea, and we have the 7th Fleet 
right there, and we can’t help them?’’ 
he asked. 
Although some Navy officials were 
reluctant to use American ships to res-
cue refugees, Mondale overruled them, 
and the Navy soon came to cherish 
their humanitarian role. As one ship 
commander involved in a rescue oper-
ation told Mondale: ‘‘I thought it 
would demoralize my sailors, but I was 
dead wrong. It’s going to make a dif-
ference to the way those people think 
about America. Because when their life 
was at risk, they saw this ship with an 
American flag come up and these 
young guys go down and pick them up 
. . . It’s hard to stay mad at a policy 
like that.’’ 
Of course, saving refugees was only 
half the battle. Refugees also needed to 
find countries willing to accept them. 
Again, Mondale led the country and 
the world. 
In July 1979, Carter sent Mondale to 
Geneva to address a U.N. conference 
where Mondale delivered an eloquent 
and effective speech. He invoked the 
inadequate efforts taken by the inter-
national community to assist Euro-
pean Jews fleeing Nazi Germany. In 
that case, the consequences of inaction 
were the death camps.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

May 12, 2022 
‘‘Let us not re-enact their error,’’ he 
told the delegates. ‘‘Let us not be the 
heirs to their shame. . . . 
‘‘We face a world problem. Let us 
fashion a world solution. 
‘‘History will not forgive us if we fail. 
History will not forget us if we suc-
ceed.’’ 
Mondale’s speech prompted a stand-
ing 
ovation. 
More 
importantly, 
it 
prompted many nations to increase the 
number of refugees they accepted. 
The record is clear. The only reason 
my family and families like ours were 
given sanctuary and opportunity in 
America was because of leaders like 
Mondale, who chose to do what was 
morally right over what was politically 
popular. 
While history does not repeat itself, 
it does rhyme. Today, a new refugee 
crisis has emerged. Millions of families 
have fled Ukraine in the face of Rus-
sian savagery. To date, the response 
from the international community has 
mostly been in the mold of Mondale. 
World leaders have spent political and 
financial capital to help their fellow 
human beings. 
We must continue to meet the moral 
moment. We must follow the Mondale 
model. 
Thank God for Walter Mondale. Rest 
in peace, Mr. Vice President.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
COMMIS-
SION OF THE USS ‘‘FRANK E. PE-
TERSEN, JR.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the historic 
commission of the USS Frank E. Peter-
sen, Jr. The brave servicemen and serv-
icewomen of the United States Navy 
are now in command of an impressive 
vessel 
with 
an 
equally 
impressive 
namesake. 
Lieutenant General Frank E. Peter-
sen, Jr., was an all-American hero who 
served with distinction for 38 years. As 
the 
first 
African-American 
Marine 
Corps aviator and first African-Amer-
ican Marine Corps general officer, 
Lieutenant 
General 
Petersen 
went 
above and beyond the call of duty as a 
fighter pilot in over 350 combat mis-
sions in both the Korean and Vietnam 
wars. 
For this exemplary service, Lieuten-
ant General Petersen was well deco-
rated, 
receiving 
the 
Distinguished 
Service Medal, the Superior Service 
Medal, the Purple Heart, as well as nu-
merous others. His service was exem-
plary, and the American people are 
eternally grateful to him and his com-
mitment to our country. 
This vessel will be a mainstay of the 
U.S. Armed Forces and, as its name-
sake did, will overcome all in the pur-
suit of excellent. As soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, and marines have done for gen-
erations, the crew members will con-
tinue to carry the torch of liberty and 
defend our great Nation. 
CONGRATULATING THE PARRIS ISLAND MARINE 
CORPS BAND 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Lowcountry’s 
best, the Parris Island Marine Corps 
Band, for their Emmy-nominated origi-
nal composition called ‘‘You Were 
There.’’ This piece salutes the first re-
sponders who continued to work at the 
height of the pandemic, honoring their 
commitment to serve and their dedica-
tion to serve. 
This piece was inspired by Mrs. 
Lakin Pellon, the wife of the band di-
rector, Chief Warrant Officer Mark 
Pellon, who worked with COVID–19 pa-
tients at the height of the pandemic in 
Los Angeles, Beaufort, and Hilton Head 
Island. Her bravery during the pan-
demic exemplifies the spirit of first re-
sponders 
across 
the 
Nation. 
Mrs. 
Pellon, as well as so many other first 
responders from communities just like 
the Lowcountry, made sacrifices every 
day for us, and we owe them an enor-
mous debt. 
The marines who performed this 
touching piece are the first responders 
for the Nation when we have dangers 
abroad, but it is remarkable to see 
their tribute to our first responders at 
home. 
Congratulations on this tremendous 
honor. 
RECOGNIZING A TRIBUTE TO FIRST RESPONDERS 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a tribute to first re-
sponders in Charleston during National 
Police Week. Charleston Mayor John 
Tecklenburg partnered with visual art-
ist Kelvin Blufton and numerous cur-
rent and former law enforcement offi-
cials from across the Lowcountry for 
an unveiling of ‘‘ESCAPE.’’ 
‘‘ESCAPE’’ is an exhibit of original 
paintings of first responders by Mr. 
Blufton that is meant to educate young 
people in the principles of civil service 
and the subsequent responsibility of 
serving in our community. 
‘‘ESCAPE’’ stands for East Side Civic 
Art Public Engagement and is tailored 
to encourage young people to aspire to 
be first responders in order to better 
serve the Lowcountry. 
Mayor Tecklenburg and Mr. Blufton 
are helping to raise the next genera-
tion of public servants, and we couldn’t 
be more thrilled with the progress they 
are making. Congratulations to them 
both on this amazing unveiling. 
RECOGNIZING BATTERY CREEK HIGH SCHOOL 
WILDLIFE HABITAT PROGRAM 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Battery Creek High 
School, a fantastic Lowcountry school 
in Beaufort, South Carolina, with an 
excellent wildlife habitat education 
program that has recently won the 
South Carolina State championship 
and will be sending four young men to 
the national competition in London, 
Kentucky. 
The Wildlife Habitat Education Pro-
gram is a hands-on environmental edu-
cation program that provides students 
an opportunity to test their wildlife 
knowledge. This knowledge is invalu-
able to young people, particularly in 
the Lowcountry, as they learn impor-
tant lessons about wildlife manage-
ment and conservation. 
Conservation is an important value 
we all share in our community, and 
these young men are helping to lead 
the charge in conservation efforts 
throughout 
the 
Lowcountry 
and 
throughout the State of South Caro-
lina. 
This championship has meant a great 
deal to the Beaufort community, and 
we couldn’t be more proud of our young 
students. 
Congratulations to Hunter Smith, 
Diego 
Vega, 
Hunter 
Hollingsworth, 
Tanner McCracken, and Ms. Beth Ann 
Melton. We wish all of them the best at 
nationals in July and August. 
RECOGNIZING CHRIS AND SHEILA PORZUCZEK 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
one 
of 
the 
Lowcountry’s 
businessowners, 
Chris 
and Sheila Porzuczek of Tortuga’s 
Mexican Grill on Edisto Beach. 
Last week, Tortuga’s donated a por-
tion of their proceeds from an event 
which the Edisto Beach Loggerhead 
Turtle Project held during Cinco de 
Mayo called Tacos for Turtles. 
This event not only helped to raise 
money, but also helped raise awareness 
of the importance of turtle conserva-
tion and keeping the lights off at night 
to help prevent confusion for newly 
hatched turtles on their way into the 
ocean. 
Despite staffing shortages, which are 
affecting 
businesses 
across 
the 
Lowcountry right now, Chris and Shei-
la are known as hard workers and sup-
port 
local 
nonprofits 
in 
the 
Lowcountry often. 
Thank you to Chris and Sheila for 
their hard work and their contribu-
tions to the Lowcountry. 
f 
WOMEN’S REPRODUCTION 
FREEDOM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support and in defense of 
women’s 
reproductive 
freedom 
and 
equal 
rights 
to 
comprehensive 
healthcare. 
The leaked Alito opinion shows the 
Supreme Court is likely to overturn 
Roe v. Wade, the critical precedent 
that has protected a woman’s right to 
bodily autonomy for nearly 50 years. 
Suddenly, millions of women across 
America are on the brink of being de-
nied their fullness of rights, and Amer-
ica is about to become less free. 
Undeterred, Republicans are now pub-
licly talking about a national abortion 
ban, States rights notwithstanding. We 
are staring down an emergency. 
I was a young teen when the Supreme 
Court ruled on Roe v. Wade. That re-
markable ruling meant that my gen-
eration would not have to suffer the 
cruel and dangerous world where abor-
tion was illegal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4872 
May 12, 2022 
My generation, and all who have 
come after, have benefited beyond 
measure from ensuring that women 
have control over their bodies and are 
able to make their personal healthcare 
decisions in private counsel with their 
families and their doctors, without 
having to risk their safety or their 
lives. 
In the House, we passed the Women’s 
Health Protection Act to codify Roe. 
Across the Capitol yesterday, 51 Sen-
ators turned their backs on women’s 
rights and voted against this legisla-
tion. It is shameful. I am calling on the 
Senate to work together to protect 
women across the country. We cannot 
afford to backslide. We must preserve 
access to safe medical procedures and 
respect women’s bodily autonomy. 
b 1115 
MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of Mental 
Health Awareness Month. 
As President Biden declared in his 
proclamation this month, each May we 
raise awareness about the importance 
of mental health and its impact on the 
well-being of all Americans, including 
children, adults, families, and commu-
nities across our Nation. 
We also give thanks to the dedicated 
mental health providers whose service 
and support improve the lives of so 
many Americans. We stand in soli-
darity with those who are experiencing 
mental health conditions, renewing our 
commitment to providing them with 
the support they need and deserve. 
Madam Speaker, every day Ameri-
cans bear a tremendous mental health 
burden, exacerbated by COVID–19. The 
pandemic has increased daily chal-
lenges for all of us and for so many 
have pushed us to our limits. Frontline 
workers, seniors forced into isolation, 
parents juggling work and teaching our 
kids from home, and especially our 
young people navigating life’s deci-
sions, often without the basic support 
systems they deserve and need. 
We feel the impact of our daily inter-
action with family, friends, neighbors, 
and even strangers, and we see the im-
pact in the numbers. Increased demand 
for mental health services, rising inci-
dents of domestic violence, and far too 
often stories of people, old and young, 
losing all hope and dying by suicide. 
I have heard from the Ann & Robert 
H. Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago 
about the severity of the pediatric 
mental health crisis. Prior to the pan-
demic, Lurie Children’s used to get 50 
calls per week for new appointments 
for mental health services. They are 
now getting 50 calls a day. Their emer-
gency 
department 
treated 
a 
prepandemic two to three suicide at-
tempts each month. That number has 
jumped to two or three attempts each 
day. 
Countless teachers have come to me 
telling me about the struggles their 
students are facing and the increasing 
difficulties they endure simply man-
aging their classrooms. A study found 
that the mental health of colleges stu-
dents declined between 2013 and 2021, 
with 135 percent increase in depression, 
and 110 percent increase in anxiety. 
According to the CDC, during the 
pandemic 18- to 24-year-olds became 25 
percent more likely to report they had 
seriously considered suicide. In my dis-
trict, Dylan Buckner, a star quarter-
back due to graduate with honors in 
mere months, was lost to suicide in 
January of 2021, devastating his family, 
friends, and community. 
More recently, my community lost a 
shining light, Orli Sheffey, to suicide 
this spring. She was a wonderful young 
woman I had the privilege of knowing 
her entire life. Her parents, Steve and 
Timna, her sisters, Ariel and Ayelet, 
are heartbroken but are also com-
mitted to helping others get the men-
tal healthcare they need. Steve specifi-
cally asked that Congress take up the 
issue of mental health on college cam-
puses. 
Another of my constituents lost their 
son, Washington Metropolitan Police 
Officer Jeff Smith, due to physical and 
mental injuries incurred on January 6. 
Officer Smith’s father shared with me 
that the stigma around mental health 
and the lack of access to care contrib-
uted to his tragic loss. 
Orli’s, Dylan’s, and Jeff’s stories, like 
everyone’s, are specific to their indi-
vidual circumstances, but the tragedy 
of young lives cut short and the inci-
dence of people of all ages not able to 
get the care they need reflect our na-
tional failure to meet this mental 
health moment. 
As a Nation, we desperately need 
more mental health awareness, edu-
cation, and better mental health serv-
ices. We need more mental health pro-
viders and residents available to both 
adults and to children to address the 
access gap that so many families con-
front. 
Getting America healthy requires 
that we get those facing these chal-
lenges the resources they need, or if we 
as a Nation are going to achieve our 
greatest potential, then we must help 
the sickest among us get healthy so 
they can reach their full potential.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I am here this morning to 
talk about Social Security. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD two articles: The first is enti-
tled, ‘‘It’s time for U.S. Congress to de-
bate Social Security reform in the 
light of day’’ by The New York Times 
reporter Mark Miller. 
The second is ‘‘The Early Impact of 
COVID–19 on Job Losses among Black 
Women in the United States’’ sub-
mitted by Michelle Holder. 
IT’S TIME FOR U.S. CONGRESS TO DEBATE SO-
CIAL SECURITY REFORM
IN
THE LIGHT
OF 
DAY 
(By Mark Miller, May 5, 2022) 
(Reuters).—Social 
Security 
has 
never 
failed to make its benefit payments since the 
mailing of monthly checks began in 1940, but 
most Americans these days are worried 
about the future of the program. 
Who can blame them? Social Security’s 
two trust funds are projected to run dry in 
2034, and the program would be able to pay 
only 80 percent of its obligations to retirees 
and disabled workers at that point. Politi-
cians don’t exactly generate confidence when 
they make irresponsible—and wrong—com-
ments claiming that Social Security is going 
bankrupt or running out of money. 
The result is public skepticism and con-
cern. Forty-two percent of working Ameri-
cans tell Pew Research Center pollsters that 
they doubt they will receive any benefits 
from Social Security. An equal share thinks 
they will receive a benefit, but at a reduced 
level. 
The Social Security trustees have been 
projecting this shortfall since the early 
1990s, but the U.S. Congress has failed to act. 
What we need is a full, public debate on re-
form legislation—and an actual vote by law-
makers. The window is open for that to hap-
pen this year—the Democratic Party has de-
veloped an internal consensus on legislation 
that addresses the solvency problem, and 
also expands benefits modestly. It controls 
both legislative chambers—at least for now. 
The Social Security 2100 Act is supported by 
202 House Democrats—in other words, nearly 
the entire party caucus. The bill probably 
cannot jump the hurdle of a Republican fili-
buster in the U.S. Senate, but it is impera-
tive to get everyone in Congress on the 
record with a vote on this issue. 
‘‘People have got to know where you 
stand,’’ said U.S. Representative John Lar-
son, a Connecticut Democrat and chief spon-
sor of the legislation. 
EXPANDED BENEFITS 
The Social Security 2100 legislation would 
close 52 percent of the long-term shortfall, 
according to an analysis by the Social Secu-
rity actuaries. It would push the trust fund 
depletion date back to 2038 by adding new 
payroll taxes to wages over $400,000—cur-
rently, taxation stops at $147,000. Earlier 
versions of the bill restored solvency for 75 
years by also gradually increasing payroll 
tax rates, but that has been eliminated to re-
flect President Joe Biden’s campaign pledge 
not to raise taxes on people with incomes 
below $400,000 per year. 
The bill does recognize the need to expand 
benefits, which can help address rising in-
come inequality, and racial and gender gaps 
in retirement security. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has widened those gaps. What’s more, 
Gen-Xers and Millennials are likely to fare 
even worse than boomers and today’s seniors 
when they reach retirement. This is the re-
sult of factors including escalating higher- 
education costs, staggering student debt bur-
dens, wage stagnation, soaring housing costs 
and the decline of traditional defined benefit 
pensions. 
Social Security 2100 includes a modest 2 
percent across-the-board boost in benefits, 
and it would shift the annual cost-of-living

increase to a more generous formula. It also 
includes targeted benefit increases such as a 
new minimum benefit level for very low in-
come seniors, and improved benefits for wid-
ows and widowers. It also would provide 
caregiver credits that increase benefits for 
people who take time out of the workforce to 
care for dependent family members. And it 
would repeal the Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion (WEP) and Government Pension Offset 
(GPO), which currently penalize many people 
who work in the public sector. 
What would Republicans do to solve the 
Social Security problem if they take control 
of Congress next year? 
Earlier versions of Republican reform 
plans have called for benefit cuts in the form 
of higher retirement ages and means testing. 
U.S. Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Repub-
lican, recently set off a small firestorm with 
a proposal to sunset all federal legislation 
every five years—an idea that at least in the-
ory would require regular reauthorization of 
Social Security and Medicare. He also wants 
every American to pay income taxes—no 
matter their level of income. 
Republicans have also made clear that 
they prefer to handle Social Security reform 
behind closed doors. Senator Mitt Romney, a 
Utah Republican, has proposed the ironically 
named TRUST Act, which would create a 
closed process for legislators to propose 
changes to the Social Security and Medicare 
trust funds, culminating in an up or down 
vote process. 
This approach is a favorite play for law-
makers looking to keep their fingerprints off 
unpopular legislation—bills emerge from 
faceless, bipartisan committees. The last 
time it was attempted for Social Security 
was the unsuccessful Bowles-Simpson com-
mission, which proposed a range of unpopu-
lar benefit cuts in 2011 that would have im-
pacted middle-class seniors. 
Fighting to improve Social Security would 
fulfill a promise that Biden made as a presi-
dential candidate, and it could energize vot-
ers. Public opinion polling has consistently 
shown strong public support for maintaining 
current benefit levels, even if new taxes are 
needed. 
New polling by Data for Progress shows 
that increasing benefits would make a large 
chunk of independent voters more likely to 
support Democratic candidates for Congress 
this fall. The idea of shoring up Social Secu-
rity polls extremely well with middle-class 
Americans: 63 percent of those without a col-
lege degree tell Pew pollsters that Social Se-
curity finances should a top priority for Con-
gress and the president. 
This is a battle worth fighting in 2022.

Working Paper No. 963 
THE
EARLY
IMPACT
OF
COVID–19 ON
JOB 
LOSSES
AMONG
BLACK
WOMEN
IN
THE 
UNITED STATES 
By 
(Michelle Holder, John Jay College, City 
University of New York)

(Thomas Masterson, Levy Economics 
Institute of Bard College) 
INTRODUCTION 
The COVID–19 pandemic seemingly ap-
peared out of nowhere but changed nearly 
everything. Until February of 2020, the 
American economy had been at what is con-
sidered full employment levels—3.5 percent 
overall. Even African Americans, who tradi-
tionally occupy a less favorable position in 
the labor market (as measured by unemploy-
ment and wage disparities) were experi-
encing historically low levels of unemploy-
ment. However, the first signs of the massive 
job losses that were to come appeared when 
initial claims filed for unemployment insur-
ance rose to unprecedented levels in March, 
leaping from approximately 220,000 new 
claims filed each week since the start of the 
year to an astonishing 3.3 million by the 
third week in March, then more than dou-
bling the following week to 6.9 million. 
While this pace slowed down in May, new 
claims for unemployment insurance in the 
United States still numbered in the millions 
each week. With shelter-in-place orders im-
plemented across the country in February 
and March, along with state-by-state manda-
tory shutdowns of ‘‘nonessential’’ businesses, 
aggregate demand for many goods and serv-
ices ground to a halt, leaving tens of mil-
lions of American workers jobless. 
As 
the 
pandemic 
unfolded, 
industries 
deemed nonessential, such as leisure, hospi-
tality, and retail trade, were leveled. Many 
occupations in these industries are low-wage, 
and women constitute a greater share of the 
low-wage labor force in the United States 
than men (Holder 2018, 689). Moreover, the 
largest share of minimum wage workers in 
America is female (Holder 2017, 12). Thus, 
when the US Department of Labor’s Bureau 
of Labor Statistics (BLS) released their 
monthly ‘‘Employment Situation’’ report for 
April on May 8 (a week later than it nor-
mally would have) it was met with only mod-
est surprise that the April unemployment 
rate for women exceeded the unemployment 
rate for men—16.2 percent versus 13.2 per-
cent, respectively (US DOL 2020). The pat-
tern of higher unemployment for women as 
compared to men is also true in the Black 
community, along with the US’s long-stand-
ing pattern of an unemployment rate for 
Blacks 
that 
routinely 
exceeds 
that 
of 
Whites—16.7 percent and 14.2 percent, respec-
tively (US DOL 2020). 
As COVID–19 deaths began to mount, it be-
came clear that African Americans were dis-
parately affected not only with regard to 
their livelihoods, but also their very lives; 
while the Black community is 13 percent of 
the US population, given inequitable access 
to healthcare as well as other structural in-
equalities, they accounted for roughly one- 
quarter of all deaths in the country as of 
May 28, 2020 (US CDC 2020). Moreover, as 
some American workers were able to do their 
jobs from the comfort of their homes, a high 
proportion of ‘‘essential’’ workers (somewhat 
loosely defined as those who work in super-
markets, public transportation, pharmacies, 
grocery stores, nursing homes, hospitals, and 
correctional facilities, among other indus-
tries) were African American, other people of 
color, women, and an intersection of the 
these groups—women of color. The goal of 
this paper is to closely examine the con-
tours, depth, and causes of COVID–l9’s im-
pact on Black women’s employment in the 
United States. Because the early job loss 
numbers indicate that women in the United 
States have thus far borne the brunt of the 
COVID–19–inspired downturn, most demo-
graphic comparisons we make in this text 
will be between female demographic groups, 
primarily Black and White women, using the 
lenses of both feminist economic theory and 
stratification economics. 
GENDER AND RACE IN THE COVID–19 DOWNTURN 
The recession of the early 1980s, as well as 
the Great Recession, were downturns in 
which men, Black workers, and Latinx work-
ers experienced disproportionate job loss, 
mostly attributable to the industrial dis-
tribution of these groups—they tend to be 
employed in industries that are more vulner-
able to cyclical downturns (Hoynes, Miller, 
and Schaller 2012). Although there were 
across-the-board job losses among all major 
demographic groups during the Great Reces-
sion, according to Haynes, Miller, and 
Schaller (2012) the smallest absolute increase 
in unemployment during that downturn oc-
curred among White women. Those research-
ers attributed this to the industrial distribu-
tion of women whom, they posited, tend to 
be employed in industries less vulnerable to 
cyclicality than industries in which men are 
concentrated. Women of color, however, were 
more vulnerable than women overall, given 
the roles of race and ethnicity in that 
group’s industrial distribution. 
The current economic downturn in the 
United States, however, is quite unlike busi-
ness cycle downturns of the past. The normal 
predictions and expectations of where job 
losses were going to occur have not closely 
followed past patterns. Industries such as 
leisure and hospitality, retail trade, con-
struction, manufacturing, and ‘‘other serv-
ices’’ (including personal care services) were 
labeled as ‘‘nonessential,’’ and companies op-
erating in these industries were ordered, 
state by state, to temporarily cease or slow 
down operations. Industries operating in the 
sphere of ‘‘essential services’’ were allowed 
to continue, but with significant restric-
tions, resulting in significant declines in 
economic activity. With much of the US pop-
ulation sheltering in place during the early 
phases of the pandemic—including those em-
ployees who were able to work from home— 
other industries still considered essential, 
like transportation, experienced a massive 
slowdown m activity. Unlike the Great Re-
cession and the recession of the early 1980s, 
women, particularly women of color, were 
bearing the brunt of early job losses given 
the extraordinary nature in which economic 
activity was deliberately, not organically, 
slowed down or halted. Rising unemploy-
ment among women, given their overrepre-
sentation in service industries and occupa-
tions, became pervasive (see Boushey and 
Sanchez Cumming 2020). While jobholding by 
Black women in services deemed essential 
(like hospitals and supermarkets) offered 
some insulation against job loss, this was 
not enough to offset large job losses in other 
sectors. 
CHANGES IN LABOR FORCE INDICATORS FOR 
WOMEN DURING THE EARLY PANDEMIC 
The seasonally adjusted US unemployment 
rate for April 2020 climbed by slightly more 
than 10 percentage points, to 14.7 percent 
from 4.4 percent in March. This increase was 
the largest month-to-month change in over 
70 years. Moreover, the April unemployment 
rate was nearly 50 percent higher than the 
average US unemployment rate during the 
18–month period of the Great Recession. This 
was clearly an astonishing rate of job loss. 
Drilling down the numbers by gender and 
race, Latinas appear to have experienced the 
highest unemployment rate in April—20.2 
percent—followed 
by 
African 
American 
women at 16.2 percent; White women’s unem-
ployment rate reached 15 percent (US DOL 
2020). However, the change in the rate of un-
employment only captures part of the story; 
after averaging approximately 63 percent for 
the first quarter of 2020, the overall labor 
force participation rate declined to just over 
60 percent in April, signaling the start of an 
exodus from the American labor force. The 
official unemployment rate does not capture 
individuals who are not in the labor force, 
and that number swelled by about 8 million 
in April, with nearly half of this increase at-
tributable to persons who wanted to work 
but who could not find employment. 
Among major female demographic groups 
for whom the BLS provides monthly data, 
Black women possessed both the highest 
labor force participation rate as well as em-
ployment-population 
ratio, 
leaving

group especially vulnerable to the COVID–19– 
inspired downturn, given their strong at-
tachment to the workforce. Black women’s 
unemployment rate for April shot up to 16.4 
percent, higher than that for Black men, 
whose unemployment rate reached 16.2 per-
cent that month. Unlike the Great Recession 
of 2007–9, where the unemployment rate for 
Black men significantly exceeded that of 
Black women, the early impact of COVID–19 
on unemployment has clearly been ‘‘gen-
dered,’’ with more intense ramifications for 
African American women. 
In comparing Black and White women, in 
February of this year, prior to the initial im-
pact of COVID–19 on US employment, Black 
women not only had a higher unemployment 
rate than White women (4.8 percent versus 
2.8 percent, respectively), but also a higher 
labor force participation rate (63.8 percent 
versus 58.2 percent, respectively). Feminist 
economists such as Nina Banks (2019), Cecilia 
Conrad (2005), and Randy Albelda (1985) have 
long highlighted the historically higher 
labor force participation rate of Black 
women compared to White women in the 
United States. As noted in the preceding 
paragraph, this attachment to the labor 
force also makes Black women more vulner-
able during economic downturns. In exam-
ining table 1, while there appears to be little 
difference in the increase in the unemploy-
ment rate from February to April for Black 
women compared to White women, because 
of Black women’s more entrenched—and, at 
the same time, more precarious attachment 
to the American workforce (evidenced by 
historically higher unemployment rates than 
White women)—the impact of COVID–19 on 
Black women’s position in the labor force 
has been somewhat deeper than that for 
White women, with slightly larger (and sta-
tistically significant) declines for Black 
women than White women in both the labor 
force participation rate and the employ-
ment-population ratio. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The early job losses during the COVID–19 
pandemic were characterized by gender and 
racial disparities. With regard to job losses 
by industry, the ‘‘healthcare and social serv-
ices’’ industry accounted for nearly 14 per-
cent of all workers in the United States but 
28 percent of employed Black women and 22 
percent of employed White women; the 17 
percent decline in employment in this indus-
try, therefore, was bound to have an outsized 
impact on women. Feminist economic theory 
has explored the role that discrimination 
plays in occupational crowding by gender, 
notably the historical exclusion of women 
from jobs that are deemed more appropriate 
for men (see Beller 1982). In addition, Black 
women, along with Black men, suffered dis-
proportionately staggering losses in the ‘‘ac-
commodation and food services’’ industry, an 
industry leveled during the pandemic, where 
the overrepresentation of Black female and 
Black male workers exceeds that of their 
White counterparts. This industry offers no-
toriously low wages and stratification eco-
nomic theory suggests that privileged groups 
have a material interest in maintaining 
sexism and racism—as well as other forms of 
oppression—because benefits accrue to ad-
vantaged groups as a whole (see Darity et. 
al. 2017). This is true even though the bene-
fits do not necessarily accrue to all indi-
vidual members of the privileged group at all 
times. Thus, discrimination can and does 
persist in market-based economies. The 
crowding of Black workers in low-wage in-
dustries is suggestive of opportunity hoard-
ing by White workers, consistent with strati-
fication economic theory. 
Occupationally, the roles of both gender 
and race proved to be disastrous for employ-
ment losses for Black women. The only two 
major occupational categories that experi-
enced employment declines greater than 50 
percent—‘‘food 
preparation 
and 
serving’’ 
(which accounts for just over 5 percent of all 
workers) and ‘‘personal care and services’’ 
(which accounts for nearly 3 percent of all 
workers)—are two occupations where, among 
Black and White employees, Black women 
are the only demographic group overrepre-
sented in both. 
The pandemic has catalyzed a public 
health and economic crisis on a scale not 
seen since the Great Depression. In one 
month, the unemployment rate increased by 
10 percentage points, the largest month-to- 
month increase in more than a generation. 
While the devastation has been widespread, 
it is not shared equitably across race and 
gender. There are two main reasons why 
Black women are disproportionately im-
pacted by the COVID–19 recession. First, 
Black women in the labor market face high 
levels of occupational and industrial seg-
regation. Second, Black women’s strong at-
tachment to the labor market, as measured 
by their labor force participation rate and 
employment-to-population 
ratio, 
makes 
them 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
economic 
downturns, and this current recession is no 
exception. 
Unlike previous economic downturns, in-
dustries once thought immune to recessions 
were ordered by government officials to stop 
or significantly slow their activity. Between 
February and April, when the economy shed 
millions of jobs, Black women experienced 
larger-than-overall declines in employment 
due to their concentration in parts of the 
economy. Black women are overrepresented 
in ‘‘essential’’ jobs, like nursing assistants 
and cashiers, while at the same time also 
overrepresented in occupations and indus-
tries that are shedding workers by the mil-
lions, such as hotels, restaurants, and retail 
trade. In responding to this economic crisis, 
policymakers must firmly commit to a pol-
icy agenda that provides immediate relief to 
those who need it and make our economy 
more stable and equitable in the future. In 
the short term, we should continue to give 
direct support to families through cash pay-
ments and an expansion of unemployment 
benefits. In the long term, we can enact poli-
cies that fix the structural flaws of our sys-
tem, including using economic measures tied 
directly to the position and status of Black 
women in order to more accurately deter-
mine when an economy has reached those 
often left behind. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I think as Martin Luther 
King would say, it is the ‘‘fierce ur-
gency of now’’ that we are dealing 
with, and by that I mean the fierce ur-
gency being the pandemic that this 
country is currently going through. 
That pandemic has taken more than 
740,000 Americans over the age of 65. 
That same group over the age of 65 is 
the group that is hurt most by infla-
tion. Why? Because they are on fixed 
incomes. They are Social Security re-
cipients. And they need our help now. 
The good news, thanks to the efforts 
of Chairman NEAL and the Ways and 
Means Committee, we have established 
a Racial Equity Task Force. The gen-
tlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL), 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Nevada 
(Mr. 
HORSFORD), and the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GOMEZ) have all put to-
gether extensive reporting that talks 
about the inequality that exists in 
what our colleague John Lewis said 
was the next civil rights movement, 
and that is to make sure we uplift ev-
erybody in this country who has 
worked all their lives, paid into a sys-
tem, and receives below-poverty-level 
checks from their government. 
That is about to end with the passage 
of Social Security 2100: A Sacred Trust, 
called the sacred trust by President 
Biden because it is. We no longer have 
to go back to the Great Depression to 
talk about the impact of Social Secu-
rity and why it came into prominence. 
You only have to go back as far as 2008– 
2009 to understand that during that re-
cession, people saw their 401(k) become 
a 101(k). 
During that same time period, Social 
Security never missed a payment, not 
a spousal, not a dependent coverage 
payment, not a pension payment, and 
not a disability payment. 
With Memorial Day approaching, it 
was good listening to the Members 
come and talk about honoring our vet-
erans on Memorial Day. Several came 
down this week honoring National Po-
lice Week as well, talking about police 
officers who need help. Millions of po-
lice officers and their spouses across 
this country, because of WEP and GPO, 
are penalized and don’t receive the So-
cial Security benefits that they richly 
deserve. President Biden has put an 
end to that. 
RICHARD
NEAL
has also introduced 
legislation as well with respect to that. 
So has Mr. DAVIS and Mr. BRADY on the 
Republican side. It is long overdue. If 
you want to help police officers, if you 
want to help our veterans, so many of 
whom rely more on Social Security 
Disability than they do on the VA, we 
need to reform Social Security. Con-
gress has not enhanced Social Security 
in more than 51 years. A gallon of milk 
in 1971 cost 72 cents. Look at the cost 
now, not only of milk but of bread and 
butter and gas and rent, and under-
stand the absolute necessity to help 
out the people who during this pan-
demic need it the most. 
Congress can no longer kick the can 
down the road. This is our responsi-
bility on our watch; and on Memorial 
Day, every citizen in this country 
ought to be asking Congress what it is 
going to do. What do we have to do? A 
very simple thing that we take an oath 
of office and raise our hands and pledge 
allegiance to the Constitution, and 
that is vote. Vote on an issue that will 
help the people of this great Nation 
out: People who have been neglected, 
more than 3 million who have paid in 
all their lives and get below-poverty- 
level checks; millennials and Gen Xers, 
who are going to need Social Security 
even 
more 
than 
the 
10,000 
baby 
boomers a day who become eligible for 
Social Security. The time to act is 
now. 
Let’s heed the words of Martin Lu-
ther King and understand the ‘‘fierce 
urgency of now’’ so that people won’t 
have to put food back on the shelves 
that they can’t afford or be turned

back from the drugs that they need to 
purchase and that they have a quality 
of life that they richly deserve in the

We can pay for this all by just simply

f 
THREE CRITICAL PIECES OF 
LEGISLATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of three critical pieces of legislation 
that are in the House this week. I 
proudly endorsed and cosponsored all 
three of them to keep our promise to 
essential workers and support commu-
nities across the country. It is time for 
Congress to start delivering the results 
that we have promised to the American 
people. 
First, I will begin by praising the 
passage of H.R. 2499, the Federal Fire-
fighters Fairness Act of 2022. There are 
over 15,000 firefighters employed by the 
Federal Government. Each of them is 
at greater risk of developing illnesses 
due to their job. These hazards include 
diesel emissions, carbon monoxide, and 
other 
cancer-causing 
chemicals 
re-
leased by fires that they combat on a 
regular basis. 
Madam Speaker, 48 States have com-
pensation laws that provide firefighters 
with a presumption that certain dis-
eases were contracted on the job. How-
ever, no such rule applies so far to Fed-
eral firefighters, and it is time we cor-
rect this wrong and stand behind the 
brave men and women who protect us. 
I also urge the passage of H.R. 903, 
the Rights for the Transportation Se-
curity Administration Workforce Act. 
365 days a year, TSA agents across the 
country ensure safe travel to all of us. 
Despite working through the COVID–19 
pandemic and government shutdowns, 
agents face stagnant pay. 
These brave men and women deserve 
better, which is why I am a proud co-
sponsor of H.R. 903. This legislation 
will put TSA agents on a level playing 
field with other Federal employees, 
and we need to do this today. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, I urge the 
passage of H.R. 5129, the Community 
Services Block Grant Modernization 
Act of 2022. This bill reauthorizes the 
community services block grants for 
the next 10 years that improve the 
lives of Americans across the country 
and have done so much in my district. 
Just this year, over $3 million of these 
grants helped improve the lives of com-
munities in south Texas in my district. 
This is a product of the War on Pov-
erty. These grants support poverty re-
duction, increase in health access, and 
many other benefits. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legisla-
tion and continue the program for 
south Texans and Americans across 
this country. 
I urge the House to pass these bipar-
tisan pieces of legislation so we can get 
them to the President’s desk.

Stir up our hearts, O Lord, this day, 
that we may prepare ourselves for the 
work You have laid before us. Wake

fully open to living into the hope You 
reveal to us. Strengthen our bodies

face of the challenges that lie ahead. 
Reach into our souls, that we would be 
moved to live boldly into the morals 
with which You have inspired us. 
Then may we, with the whole of our 
heart, mind, body, and soul, dedicate 
ourselves to the commonwealth of peo-
ple You have called us to serve.

other in our obedience to the truth. 
May our love for our country and our 
communities be faithful to Your living 
and enduring Word in our lives. 
Be this day, Holy God, the founda-
tion of all our efforts and, we, the re-
flection of Your perfect love. 
In Your powerful name we pray. 
Amen.

HONORING FALLEN SOUTH GATE 
DETECTIVE ALEXIS GONZALEZ 
(Ms. BARRAGA´ N asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, as we 
observe National Police Week, I am 
here to honor and celebrate the life and 
service of South Gate Police Detective 
Alexis Gonzalez of South Gate, Cali-
fornia. 
Detective Gonzalez tragically passed 
away on April 25. Detective Gonzalez 
first joined the police department in 
2013 as a police explorer. He graduated 
from the Rio Hondo Police Academy in 
2017, realizing his dream of becoming a 
South Gate police officer. 
At the age of 27, Detective Gonzalez 
was a 5-year veteran of the police force 
and a hero in South Gate. He was a 
shining star and will be sorely missed 
by family, friends, and the entire com-
munity. 
We honor the life and service of De-
tective Gonzalez and his family, and of 
every police officer who has put their 
life at risk to protect our communities. 
May he rest in peace. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CORPORAL CHRISTOPHER DYE 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and 
legacy of Road Patrol Corporal Chris-
topher Dye. 
Christopher dedicated his life to the 
people of Walker County and our Na-
tion, making the ultimate sacrifice in 
the line of duty. Christopher worked at 
the Hays State Prison and the Walker 
County Sheriff’s Office until the tragic 
events of 9/11 struck our country. 
In October 2001, Christopher joined 
the Army and dedicated the next 12 
years to serving our country. Chris-
topher was a member of the 118th Air-
borne Infantry, performing tours in

Iraq and Afghanistan. Even after devel-
oping lymphoma, he never gave up his 
post. 
Christopher was highly decorated for 
his valiant service and returned to the 
Walker County Sheriff’s Office to work 
alongside his family. 
In November 2020, Corporal Dye en-
countered fentanyl on a drug arrest. 
This exposure caused him to suffer a 
massive heart attack, and he passed 
away that evening. Corporal Dye was 
awarded the Walker County Sheriff’s 
Office Employee of the Year award 
later that year. 
He is survived by his wife Kelly Jo 
and their five children. 
Today, I am introducing a resolution 
honoring Corporal Dye for his selfless 
sacrifice to the people of Walker Coun-
ty, northwest Georgia, and the Nation. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
GLORIA LANGSTON 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the extraordinary and 
impactful life of Gloria Langston, com-
munity advocate, and cofounder of 
Rochester’s first Black-owned radio 
station, who sadly passed away last 
week. 
Founded in 1974, WDKX was one of 
the first Black-owned stations in New 
York State. Their call sign is a tribute 
to Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther 
King, 
Jr., 
and 
Malcolm 
X, 
dem-
onstrating their commitment to uplift-
ing the Black community. 
Together with her husband, Andrew 
Langston, Gloria established WDKX as 
a fixture in the Rochester radio space, 
bringing people together and keeping 
our community engaged. 
My heart goes out to her beloved son, 
Andre, and the entire Langston family 
during this difficult time. May you find 
peace in knowing her legacy will live 
on through the good works of those she 
has inspired. 
f 
BIDEN ENERGY CRISIS 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, this week, 
the national average cost for a gallon 
of gasoline hit an all-time high of $4.37. 
At this rate, American families will 
spend an extra $2,000 on gasoline this 
year, on top of already historic infla-
tion. 
President Biden has tried to shift the 
blame on this issue, taking no respon-
sibility for the crisis that he and his 
administration have created. Let’s be 
clear. This is not transitory inflation. 
This is not the Putin price hike. 
This is what happens when you dis-
mantle 
American 
energy 
independ-
ence—a war on fossil fuel. That is what 
the President has done, and that is why 
energy costs started rising long before 
the Russian invasion ever began. 
The solution to rising prices is more 
domestic production. President Biden 
would rather cling to his Green New 
Deal agenda than admit that his poli-
cies have failed. America is home to an 
abundance of energy resources. We 
have the solutions to this crisis right 
here under our feet. 
What we lack is an administration 
with political willpower to do what is 
right. Until that changes, we will con-
tinue to suffer the consequences of 
President Biden’s anti-energy agenda. 
f 
PILOT TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, the National Transportation 
Safety Board found that pilot error was 
a major factor in the 2009 fatal crash of 
Flight 3407. 
In the months following the tragedy, 
the families of Flight 3407 fought for 
safety standards and improvements, 
which were signed into law and have 
saved lives. 
Now an application is before the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration to cut 
the minimum standard for pilot train-
ing in half. 
We are calling on the Federal Avia-
tion Administration to categorically 
reject this request and any attempt to 
circumvent 
pilot 
training 
require-
ments. 
Families in my western New York 
community will never have their loved 
ones back, but we can ensure that 
every family moving forward is step-
ping onto an airplane with a fully 
trained pilot. 
f 
BIDEN ECONOMIC CRISIS 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to discuss the economic crisis that is 
pummeling Florida’s families. This 
week’s financial report showed that in-
flation continues to hammer Ameri-
cans, growing by 8.3 percent over April 
of 2021. 
When coupled with workforce short-
ages and supply chain disruptions, the 
result has been catastrophic for small 
businesses—every sector of our econ-
omy is impacted. I am also gravely 
concerned that we are spiraling toward 
a recession, and yet, many of my col-
leagues seem to think the only answer 
is to spend more. 
Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we can-
not spend our way out of this crisis. We 
must stop the reckless spending that is 
fueling this problem and make tough 
choices about our priorities, just as 
each and every one of our constituents 
are being forced to do. 
CONGRATULATING 
THE 
UNIVER-
SITY 
OF 
HAWAII 
MEN’S 
VOLLEYBALL TEAM 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, today, 
just like I did 1 year ago to this day, I 
rise with extraordinary pride to con-
gratulate 
the 
2022 
NCAA 
Men’s 
Volleyball National Champions, the 
University of Hawaii Rainbow War-
riors. 
This past Saturday our Hawaii Rain-
bows defended their title on the leg-
endary 
court 
of 
Pauley 
Pavilion 
against Long Beach State University. 
Emulating their victory in 2021, they 
proved that lightning can strike twice 
by sweeping their opponent in a deci-
sive three-set match. Our Warriors dis-
played acute focus, tenacity, and bold 
dominance, boasting a 27–5 season 
record while remaining undefeated at 
home. 
As a proud alumnus and former Rain-
bow Warrior volleyball player, I, along 
with the rest of Hawaii, congratulate 
our back-to-back national champions. 
‘‘Thanks very much.’’ ‘‘Mahalo nui 
loa’’ to head coach Charlie Wade, the 
coaching staff, the UH athletics pro-
gram, the Manoa Aunties, our loyal 
boosters, and dedicated fans who sup-
port our players on and off the court. 
To our 2022 NCAA Men’s Volleyball 
Championship Team, ‘‘all the best,’’ 
‘‘no ka‘oi,’’ and Go ‘Bows!

CONGRATULATING KENTUCKY 
DERBY WINNER RICH STRIKE 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the 148th Ken-
tucky Derby winner Rich Strike, and 
Rich Strike’s owner, OU grad and Ed-
mond native, Rick Dawson. 
Rich Strike made history at the 
148th Kentucky Derby overcoming 80–1 
odds. This monumental victory is even 
more impressive as Rich Strike was 
not supposed to be in the Kentucky 
Derby, entering only after another 
horse was scratched. Rich Strike was 
added a mere 34 hours before the race 
was set to begin. 
Congratulations to Rich Strike and 
Rick Dawson for bringing the Ken-
tucky Derby to Oklahoma’s Fifth Con-
gressional District.

ciation Week. This week, and every

We also honor their sacrifices and tire-
less efforts to carry our students for-
ward during the last two difficult 
years. 
From engineering and business to 
public service and journalism, all pro-
fessions depend on the profession of 
teaching. I will always remember the 
teachers who made a difference in my 
life. I am so grateful for the teachers 
who put their heart and soul into in-
spiring students in my district each 
and every day. 
I thank our teachers’ unions, includ-
ing those in my district, the Cleveland 
Teachers Union and the Akron Edu-
cation Association, for their efforts to 
advocate for educators and to fulfill 
the promise of high-quality public edu-
cation for every student. 
Again, I thank all the teachers in 
Ohio’s 11th Congressional District and 
across America.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
FRANK M. BARKER, JR. 
(Mr. PALMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of Dr. Frank M. Barker, 
Jr., who passed away on December 27, 
2021. Dr. Barker was a humble man of 
great faith who lived his life in faithful 
service to his savior, Jesus Christ: lov-
ing and serving others, giving to those 
in need, and sharing the good news that 
God sent His only Son to Earth to save 
those who could not save themselves. 
A lifelong resident of Birmingham, 
Alabama, Dr. Barker was a graduate of 
Ramsey High School in 1949, a graduate 
of Auburn University with a degree in 
engineering, and a lifelong Auburn 
Tiger fan. He served his country as a 
jet fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy, in-
cluding service during the Korean war. 
After attending seminary, Dr. Barker 
founded 
Briarwood 
Presbyterian 
Church in Birmingham, leading a con-
gregation 
that 
was 
committed 
to 
reaching the world for Christ. Through 
his leadership, Dr. Barker played an 
important role in the formation of the 
Presbyterian Church in America, a de-
nomination that remains committed to 
the inerrancy and authority of Holy 
Scripture. 
I know that Dr. Barker’s life and leg-
acy will continue to be an inspiration 
to others and a model for living a life 
of generosity and faithfulness. 
f 
HONORING MAYOR CLARENCE 
FIELDS OF PINEVILLE, LOUISIANA 
(Ms. LETLOW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mayor Clarence Fields 
of Pineville, Louisiana, who is entering 
his final weeks in office after an ex-
traordinary career. 
A 
lifelong 
resident 
of 
Pineville, 
Mayor Fields has led the city for near-
ly 22 years. If you need any indicator of 
the amazing work he has done, look no 
further than the fact that he was re-
elected to City Hall six times and was 
unopposed in his last four elections. 
During his time in office, Mayor 
Fields has been committed to attract-
ing investment to the community and 
creating good paying jobs for residents. 
He is also known as a bridge builder— 
working across racial, political, and 
geographic lines to deliver results for 
Pineville and Rapides Parish. He has 
been an outstanding public servant, 
and our region is better because he 
chose to share his talents with the peo-
ple of his hometown. 
The mayor had planned on running 
again this year but decided to retire to 
spend more time with his grand-
children. While I will miss working 
with Mayor Fields, I wish him the best 
in his very well-deserved retirement. 
f 
UKRAINE-RUSSIAN CONFLICT 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, a lot 
has been said in the last 48 hours on 
this floor with regard to the Ukraine- 
Russian conflict; however, I think 
there are some things that should be 
added that maybe can be talked about 
a little bit more as we try to find the 
end here. And I hope the Biden admin-
istration does not give up at all on try-
ing to negotiate some sort of peace. 
First of all, I am going to address 
Russia. Russia has a very low birthrate 
now of 1.5. In addition to that, people 
right now are leaving Russia. I was on 
the San Diego border about 8 months 
ago, and at that time just in that re-
gion—one of 10 regions along the Mexi-
can border—the second biggest nation-
ality to cross was Russian. It was re-
cently reported that in the 6-month pe-
riod ending January, 8,600 Russians en-
tered this country. I would bet because 
of the war Russian immigration has 
only increased. 
With regard to Ukraine, its birthrate 
is even lower. Of approximately 180 
countries of size in the world, Ukraine 
has the second-lowest birthrate to 
South Korea at 1.1 percent. It has re-
cently been reported the United States 
will accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians in 
our country. While it is certainly the 
intent that they return, we all know 
that many of them don’t. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
week as we commemorate National Po-
lice Week for those with us and for 
those who have fallen, I think we find 
different ways to honor them. One of 
the ways we can honor them is also to 
make their job easier. Unfortunately, 
with the Biden border crisis, the num-
bers are devastating. There have been 
nearly one-quarter million migrant en-
counters in March because it is a green 
light and because it is a magnet at our 
border. There has been a 68 percent 
drop in deportations in 2021. 
Where are we going to put folks like 
this when we are overwhelming the 
ability to have the judges and to have 
their cases heard? 
It is not helping. And so we have 
sanctuary cities all across the U.S. 
that are making it more acceptable for 
illegal immigration to happen and 
making it very difficult for law en-
forcement to figure out how to process 
and how to deal with the interactions 
with local police and ICE. 
So we have to have a much more co-
herent policy on our border: help com-
plete the fence, make these gaps go 
away 
that 
so 
many 
are 
pouring 
through and giving us such huge num-
bers here. Forty-two have been ar-
rested on the terrorist watch list under 
Biden. Let’s make the job for our bor-
der police and our city police much 
easier and have a better border policy. 
f 
GAS PRICES AND THE GAS TAX 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of Orange County fami-
lies to share their frustration and out-
rage that they are feeling because of 
the skyrocketing gas prices in this 
country. 
While this administration refuses to 
embrace full energy independence and 
instead continues relying on foreign 
dictators for oil, southern Californians 
are paying more for gas than anywhere 
else in the country. On top of that, de-
spite what could be a $68 billion sur-
plus, 
Governor 
Newsom 
and 
Sac-
ramento Democrats have decided to 
raise gas taxes on July 1. My constitu-
ents simply can’t afford another day 
under the policies that are forcing 
them to pay more while getting less. 
Enough is enough. 
Whether it is here in Washington, 
D.C., or in Sacramento, President 
Biden and Governor Newsom need to 
commit to unleashing energy independ-
ence today. The people of this great 
country need relief today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4878 
May 12, 2022 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13873 of May 15, 2019, with respect 
to securing the information and com-
munications technology and services 
supply chain, is to continue in effect 
beyond May 15, 2022. 
The unrestricted acquisition or use 
in the United States of information 
and communications technology or 
services designed, developed, manufac-
tured, or supplied by persons owned by, 
controlled by, or subject to the juris-
diction or direction of foreign adver-
saries augments the ability of these 
foreign adversaries to create and ex-
ploit vulnerabilities in information and 
communications technology or serv-
ices, with potentially catastrophic ef-
fects. This threat continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13873 with respect to securing the infor-
mation 
and 
communications 
tech-
nology and services supply chain.

It is the sense of Congress that—

should be provided protections and benefits 
under title 5, United States Code; and

and benefits should not result in a reduction of 
pay or benefits to current TSA employees.

ganizations representing a significant number of 
Federal Air Marshals, to the extent provided by

trator determines appropriate.

CERTAIN ILLNESS. 
The Administrator, in coordination with the 
Director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and the Director of the National In-
stitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shall

gency, including appropriate resources.

and not later than 90 days after receiving such

a one-time bonus payment of $3,000 to each at- 
risk employee. 
SEC. 13. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
There is authorized to be appropriated such 
sums as may be necessary, to remain available 
until expended, to carry out this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON) and the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. GUEST) each will con-
trol 30 minutes. 
The Chair now recognizes the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP-
SON). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP-
SON)? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of my bill, H.R. 903, the Rights 
for the Transportation Security Ad-
ministration Workforce Act. 
This critical legislation will bring eq-
uity and improve working conditions 
to the Transportation Security Admin-
istration by providing better pay, ex-
panded collective bargaining rights, 
and basic civil service protection to 
the agency’s workforce. 
The essential employees of the TSA 
have continued to work throughout the 
pandemic, never relenting in their mis-
sion to secure air travel despite the 
risks to their health. They did so be-
fore the pandemic and continue to do 
so now despite enduring two decades of 
low pay and a lack of basic workplace 
rights enjoyed by most other Federal 
employees. 
These shortcomings have led to low 
morale and high turnover impacting 
TSA’s ability to cultivate a mature 
workforce that can skillfully combat 
the constantly evolving threats to our 
Nation’s transportation systems. In 
2020, TSA ranked dead last on pay sat-
isfaction as part of the annual Best 
Places to Work in the Federal Govern-
ment survey. 
In addition, the most recent analysis 
done on employee turnover at TSA 
shows that over a 2-year span, one in 
three transportation security officers, 
or TSOs, quit. That analysis also re-
vealed that in a single year, TSA spent 
approximately $16 million to hire and 
onboard nearly 2,000 people who left 
just months after they got the job. 
This 
revolving 
door 
of 
recruiting, 
training, and then losing TSOs is 
unsustainable and underscores the need 
to find a permanent solution that will 
ensure TSA lives up to its critical na-
tional security mission. H.R. 903 would 
permanently move TSA under title 5 of 
U.S. Code and eliminate the existing 
personnel management system that is 
the source of many of the problems I 
have enumerated. 
This bill will result in better pay and 
regular salary increases for workers 
who too often live paycheck to pay-
check and experience long paths to ca-
reer advancement despite years on the 
job. Employees will benefit from the 
same 
collective 
bargaining 
rights 
under H.R. 903 that other Federal em-
ployees have, empowering them to col-
laborate with TSA management to im-
prove working conditions at the agen-
cy. 
Employees who believe they have ex-
perienced wrongful discipline could ap-
peal their case to a neutral party to be 
heard, just as other Federal employees 
are able to do. It would eliminate TSA 
leadership’s ability to abuse special 
personnel authorities in ways that 
have historically benefited those at the 
top. In other words, Mr. Speaker, peo-
ple at the top get big raises but people 
at the bottom get the short end of the 
stick. 
TSA management would still be able 
to remove employees from duties if 
they could compromise the mission of 
the agency. Furthermore, just like any 
other unionized Federal agency, TSA’s 
security procedures would not be sub-
ject to collective bargaining with the 
workforce. 
We are fortunate to have an adminis-
tration in the White House that under-
stands the importance of making these 
changes. This week, the Biden adminis-
tration issued a Statement of Adminis-
tration Policy voicing strong support 
for the bill and noting it is in line with 
the President’s budget request for 2023. 
b 1230 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the Statement of Administration Pol-
icy. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 903—RIGHTS FOR THE TSA WORKFORCE ACT 
OF 2022—REP. THOMPSON, D–MS, AND 231 CO-
SPONSORS 
The Administration strongly supports pas-
sage of H.R. 903, the Rights for the Transpor-
tation Security Administration (TSA) Work-
force Act of 2022. This legislation is an im-
portant step in ensuring equitable pay for 
the TSA workforce and is aligned with the 
2023 President’s Budget request to improve 
pay for TSA employees. The Administration 
looks forward to working with the Congress 
to enact and fund this important legislation. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I also applaud the Biden ad-
ministration for the steps it has taken 
on its own over the last year to expand 
employees’ access to the Merit Sys-
tems Protection Board and explore ex-
panded collective bargaining and in-
creased pay for the workforce. About a 
year ago, the Secretary of Homeland 
Security released a memo that in-
structed the TSA Administrator to 
make progress on improving pay, col-
lective bargaining, and third-party ap-
peals rights. 
Laudably, the President’s budget for 
fiscal year 2023 includes a historic pro-
posal to invest in the TSA workforce in 
these ways. But critically, crucially, 
these changes would only apply to the 
coming fiscal year. That is why it is so 
essential to pass H.R. 903 so that future 
administrations cannot turn back the 
clock on these frontline aviation secu-
rity workers. 
We all know that the nature of an in-
vestment is that you have to put some 
money in upfront and see the returns 
later. Unlike a typical investment, 
however, we already have a snapshot 
into the financial benefit this legisla-
tion would yield to workers. 
Earlier this year, TSA shared with us 
that the passage of H.R. 903 would re-
sult in a 30 percent salary increase for 
the entire TSO workforce and a 21 per-
cent increase for Federal air marshals 
and other law enforcement officers 
within the agency, bringing them in 
line with their peers doing similar 
work at other agencies. 
That is astounding, Mr. Speaker, on 
its face, and it is the least we can do 
for the men and women who see us 
each week as we pass through our 
home airports on the way to Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Most 
Members, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, thank them for the job 
that they are doing and say if there is

anything they can do to help, just let 
them know. Well, Mr. Speaker, passing 
this bill would do exactly that. 
H.R. 903 has 231 bipartisan cosponsors 
and is strongly supported by the Amer-
ican Federation of Government Em-
ployees, the Air Marshals Association, 
the Association of Flight Attendants, 
the Transport Workers Union of Amer-

ment, the AFL–CIO, and the National 
Urban League.

support from these organizations. 
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF 
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL–CIO, 
Washington, DC, May 6, 2022. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
American Federation of Government Em-
ployees, AFL-CIO (AFGE), which represents 
more than 700,000 federal and District of Co-
lumbia employees in 70 agencies, including 
approximately 45,000 Transportation Secu-
rity Officers (TSOs) who protect the flying 
public, I write to urge you to vote in support 
of H.R. 903, the ‘‘Rights for the Transpor-
tation Security Administration Workforce 
Act of 2021’’ when it is considered on the 
House floor next week. 
Passage of H.R. 903 would finally provide 
due process and fair pay to TSOs by requir-
ing full collective bargaining rights and the 
GS-pay scale as is enjoyed by most federal 
government workers. When the Transpor-
tation Security Administration (TSA) was 
established, its administrator was given 
uniquely broad authority over the workforce 
to set pay and working conditions. As a re-
sult, TSOs do not benefit from the Fair 
Labor Standards Act or the General Sched-
ule pay scale and do not have representa-
tional rights accorded by Congress to most 
of the federal workforce under the Civil 
Service Reform Act of 1978. Under current 
law, TSOs cannot appeal adverse personnel 
decisions to a neutral third party, rights 
that are held by the non-TSO workforce at 
TSA as well as most law enforcement offi-
cers who serve elsewhere within the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (DHS). Other 
DHS employees, clearly vital to our national 
security, can and do appeal adverse actions 
not only to the Merit Systems Protection 
Board (MSPB) but also to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals. 
When the bill was considered in the House 
Homeland Security Committee, I testified in 
support of the legislation and shared stories 
of the struggles TSOs have suffered under 
TSA’s separate and unequal personnel man-
agement system. They are stories of harass-
ment, intimidation, humiliation, discrimina-
tion and most of all, stories of the despair 
TSOs face with no neutral party to turn to. 
This separate system is a failure that has 
fostered a toxic culture that will not change 
without legislative action. 
On June 3, 2021 Homeland Security Sec-
retary Alejandro Mayorkas directed TSA Ad-
ministrator David Pekoske to issue a new 
determination and bargain a new contract 
with the union to ‘‘more closely mirror the 
rights and benefits that are provided to bar-
gaining unit employees under Chapter 71 of 
Title 5 of the United States Code.’’ In issuing 
this directive, Secretary Mayorkas acknowl-
edged that statutorily, the provisions under 
title 5 cannot be directly granted and the 
TSO workforce does not have the direct right 
to appeal adverse actions to MSPB. This can 
only be corrected in law. 
In the nearly 21-year history of TSA, the 
Secretary’s action was both unprecedented 
and highly welcomed. However, his directive 
makes clear this is a temporary step to pro-
vide relief until these rights can be secured 
in statute. The time is now to step up and 
recognize the rushed decision almost 21 years 
ago to allow at separate personnel system no 
longer serves the employees of TSA appro-
priately, and thereby extends a disservice to 
the American public and to aviation secu-
rity. 
H.R. 903 honors TSOs’ dedication to Amer-
ica’s aviation security by: 
Statutorily repealing the TSA Administra-
tor’s authority to maintain a separate and 
unequal personnel system that applies only 
to the TSO workforce; 
Statutorily ending the TSA personnel di-
rectives that have allowed TSA to be the 
judge and jury, with no neutral third-party 
review, in workforce disciplinary matters 
and providing statutory access to MSPB; 
Requiring TSA to follow the labor-manage-
ment employee relations statutes that pro-
vide workplace rights and protections to 
most federal government employees under 
Title 5 of the U.S. Code; and 
Putting TSOs on the General Schedule pay 
scale with regular step increases, under 
which most federal employees’ pay is deter-
mined. While it takes 18 years to advance to 
the top step in the GS system, it takes 30 
years to advance through a TSA pay band. 
AFGE notes that President Biden included 
sufficient funds in his Fiscal Year 2023 Budg-
et to all for the migration to the GS system 
and the necessary bargaining and MSPB 
rights. 
I ask you to vote in support of H.R. 903 and 
oppose any amendments that weaken its in-
tent to achieve fair pay, a fair opportunity 
and put an end to this failed, toxic system. 
AFGE appreciates your support of our na-
tion’s TSOs and we look forward to working 
with you to improve the agency and the 
rights of its dedicated workforce that keeps 
the flying public safe. 
Sincerely, 
EVERETT B. KELLEY, 
National President. 
AIR MARSHAL ASSOCIATION,

Hon. BENNIE THOMPSON, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CONGRESSMAN
THOMPSON: The Air 
Marshal Association is proud to stand with 
you in support of H.R. 903—Rights for the 
TSA Workforce Act of 2021. 
It is long overdue that the men and women 
who work to keep our transportation system 
secure are treated with the respect and dig-
nity they have earned. Since the Transpor-
tation Security Administration was created 
in the aftermath of September 11th, 2001, 
TSA employees have endured a substandard 
core compensation system that effectively 
turned them into ’second-class federal work-
ers’. We thank you for championing this nec-
essary legislation throughout the past four 
Congresses, and you can again count on our 
enthusiastic support. 
On behalf of the Air Marshal Association 
Executive Board. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN CASARETTI, 
President, Air Marshal Association. 
ASSOCIATION OF FLIGHT 
ATTENDANTS—CWA, AFL–CIO 
Washington, DC, April 30, 2021. 
Hon. BENNIE THOMPSON, 
Chairman, House Homeland Security Com-
mittee, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: The Associa-
tion of Flight Attendants—CWA, AFL–CIO 
(AFA) represents 50,000 flight attendants 
across the industry. We offer our strong sup-
port for H.R. 903, the Rights for Transpor-
tation Security Administration (TSA) Work-
force Act of 2021. 
Twenty years ago, when TSA was created, 
Congress wrongfully excluded TSA agents 
from basic rights and protections afforded to 
most federal employees. The result has been 
a shameful separate and unequal system of 
low pay and inadequate protections for this 
critical group of public safety employees 
During the pandemic, 7,787 TSA employees 
have contracted COVID–19 and 16 have lost 
their lives to the virus. Under the previous 
Administration, many TSA agents were 
forced daily into close proximity with hun-
dreds, even thousands, of maskless pas-
sengers. Ignoring the advice and guidance of 
federal health agencies and public health 
leaders, TSA and the Administration per-
mitted airports to set their own rules for 
mask-wearing, denied their workers access 
to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 
and never created a preventative testing sys-
tem. These constitute a profound and unac-
ceptable 
failure 
to 
address 
the 
vulnerabilities of this essential and frontline 
workforce. The solution is clear. Congress 
must extend to TSA personnel the equal pro-
tections 
and 
representation 
long-denied 
under federal law. 
As aviation’s first responders, Flight At-
tendants depend on the professionalism and 
expertise of the TSA workforce every day. 
TSA employees need and deserve a strong 
voice at work to help promote the best con-
ditions for security of air travel. H.R. 903 en-
sures full collective bargaining rights for 
Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) to 
negotiate for better working conditions, puts 
TSA officers on the General Schedule pay 
scale, and provides officers with much need-
ed statutory worker protections against un-
fair labor practices. 
Security is very personal for me. I remem-
ber airport security prior to September 11, 
2001. I remember the faces of the screeners 
who allowed terrorists to enter Terminal C 
at Logan and to board Flight 175. I remember 
the screeners’ faces because they were there 
all the time, seven days a week, all hours of 
the day. I remember the sound of their 
voices, their tired smiles, and the long hours 
they worked for the lowest bidding security 
company just so that they could provide for 
their own families. I often wonder how those 
security agents have coped with their part in 
failing to stop the most fatal attack on U.S. 
soil. Do they understand they were set up to 
fail? 
Twenty years ago, the decision to fed-
eralize airport screening improved aviation 
security immediately. When AFGE won the 
largest organizing campaign in the public 
sector in over 70 years and gave these work-
ers a voice at the agency, our security im-
proved again. My colleagues and I depend on 
TSOs to keep us safe. We also depend on our 
union. We know that our union has made fly-
ing safer for everyone through constant vigi-
lance, and by giving frontline workers—the 
people who know the operation—a clear and 
strong voice in the workplace. Safety and se-
curity doesn’t just happen; it happens be-
cause we demand it of ourselves, demand it 
of management, and demand it of govern-
ment. 
The unjust decision to exclude TSA from 
the basic rights and protections of federal 
employees has produced a workforce that is 
among the lowest paid and least secure. 
While TSA’s diversity is a cause for celebra-
tion—55 percent of the TSA workforce iden-
tifies as a racial or ethnic minority—this 
makes their exclusion even more problem-
atic, creating yet another disparate treat-
ment, another barrier to advancement for 
historically-marginalized workers. 
We finally note that the drive to win long- 
denied rights for TSOs aligns with the goals 
of the newly-formed White House Task Force 
on Worker Organizing and Empowerment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4882 
May 12, 2022 
The first goal of this landmark Task Force is 
to ‘‘lead by example by ensuring that the 
federal government is a model employer with 
respect to encouraging worker organizing 
and collective bargaining among its work-
force (emphasis added).’’ The moment for ac-
tion has arrived. 
AFA applauds your leadership and support 
for the aviation workforce and pledges to 
work alongside you and members of this 
Committee to secure the basic worker rights 
and protections long denied to Transpor-
tation Security Officers. 
Respectfully, 
SARA NELSON, 
International President. 
TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION 
OF AMERICA, AFL–CIO, 
Washington, DC, May 4, 2022. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of more 
than 155,000 members of the Transport Work-
ers Union of America (TWU), I am writing to 
encourage you to support the Rights for the 
Transportation 
Security 
Administration 
Workforce Act of 2022 (H.R. 903). 
The security of our air system is guarded 
by Transportation Security Officers (TSOs), 
working for the Transportation Security Ad-
ministration (TSA). Despite being entrusted 
with the well-being of our air system, TSOs 
do not have the same statutory rights as 
other federal employees. H.R. 903 would en-
sure TSOs are guaranteed a fair wage scale, 
the ability to appeal disputes to an inde-
pendent third party, whistleblower protec-
tions, and other essential collective bar-
gaining rights. 
As anyone who has flown on a plane has 
seen, TSOs serve on the front lines of avia-
tion security and carry out an indispensable 
role in protecting the safety of the nation 
and the flying public. As essential personnel, 
TSOs are required to report to work without 
pay 
during 
government 
shutdowns, 
pandemics, and other emergencies. Despite 
performing vital roles necessary for the secu-
rity of our country, our TSOs are currently 
among the lowest-paid members of the fed-
eral workforce, largely because they do have 
historically not had access to the same 
workplace 
protections 
as 
other 
Federal 
workers. 
All workers deserve the right to collec-
tively bargain. The failure to provide fair 
pay and standard protections for TSOs has 
contributed to a workforce with low morale, 
high stress, and extensive turnover. In order 
to keep our country safe and provide workers 
with the pay and protections that they de-
serve, the Transport Workers Union strongly 
urges you to vote yes on the Rights for the 
Transportation 
Security 
Administration 
Workforce Act of 2022. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN SAMUELSEN, 
International President. 
TTD, 
Washington, DC, May 5, 2022. 
TTD, Calls for Passage of the Rights for the 
TSA Workforce Act of 2022. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
Transportation Trades Department, AFL- 
CIO (TTD), I urge you to vote YES on H.R. 
903, the ‘‘Rights for the TSA Workforce Act 
of 2022’’ when it is considered next week. 
Every day, thousands of Transportation 
Security Officers (TSOs) show up to work to 
keep our aviation system, mass transit net-
works, and large public gatherings safe and 
secure for transportation workers and the 
general public. However, since the creation 
of the TSA, its dedicated and skilled employ-
ees have been denied many of the basic fed-
eral worker rights and protections enjoyed 
by other federal workers, including those in 
the 
Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security. 
There is no justification for the ongoing mis-
treatment of the men and women of the TSO 
workforce, and H.R. 903 takes critical steps 
to ensure that they have the workplace 
rights they have earned and deserve. 
H.R. 903 would repeal the TSA Administra-
tor’s authority to maintain the existing un-
equal personnel system that applies only to 
TSOs, and require TSA to provide the work-
place rights and protections granted to other 
federal employees under Title 5. The bill 
would also grant TSOs access to the Merit 
Systems Protection Board—a neutral arbiter 
in workplace discipline matters that nearly 
all federal employees have access to, includ-
ing TSA management and administrative 
personnel. Finally, the bill would put TSOs 
on the general pay scale with regular step in-
creases. These reforms would dramatically 
and immediately improve working condi-
tions for TSOs and are vital for the future 
success of the workforce. 
TSOs have had to endure this workplace 
inequity for far too long, and it is a signifi-
cant factor in the low morale and high turn-
over rates that confront the agency. That 
our government continues to maintain this 
system for the professionals who keep every 
American safe is simply unconscionable. 
TTD calls on the House to pass H.R. 903, and 
to reject any amendment that seeks to 
eliminate critical components of this bill, in-
cluding the provision of fair pay and the es-
tablishment of collective bargaining rights. 
Sincerely, 
GREG REGAN, 
President. 
NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE, 
May 4, 2022. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
National Urban League, an organization 
with a 112-year history of advocating for 
policies that promote civil rights and eco-
nomic empowerment for African Americans 
and other historically underserved commu-
nities, and our Urban League affiliates in 37 
states and the District of Columbia, we write 
to express support for H.R. 903, the Rights for 
the 
Transportation 
Security 
Administration 
Workforce Act of 2022. Ensuring that Trans-
portation Security Officers (TSOs)—whose 
service helps keep us safe and our economy 
moving—receive the same rights and protec-
tions as other federal workers is important 
to the mission of the National Urban League. 
We urge Congress the swiftly pass this im-
portant piece of legislation. 
It is vital that Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA)’s workforce be pro-
tected in the workplace and compensated 
fairly in order to continue to reflect commu-
nities they serve. Nationwide, 55 percent of 
the 60,000 workers at TSA are people of color. 
Black Americans make up about 11 percent 
of the overall population but nearly triple 
that (32.7 percent) of transportation screen-
ers. Latino and Asian Americans also make 
up a larger share of the transportation secu-
rity workforce than their share of the US 
population and women make up over 41 per-
cent of employees. 
In spite of the fact that TSA is driving the 
diversity and inclusion of people of color and 
women in our country’s homeland security 
workforce, its workers are not afforded the 
protections and benefits of their counter-
parts elsewhere in the Department of Home-
land Security or the federal government at 
large. TSOs face inequities compared to 
other federal employees. They lack the 
rights and protections afforded to their peers 
in the federal government under Title 5 of 
the U.S. Code. TSA screeners do not have the 
same protections to collectively bargain. 
Their pay scale lags behind that of other 
agencies in the government and they are 
missing out on the Family and Medical 
Leave Act protections available elsewhere in 
the government. Potential whistleblowers in 
TSA are not protected. Without access to an 
objective outside body like the Merit Sys-
tems Protection Board or negotiated griev-
ance procedures, TSOs are denied the ability 
to appeal adverse personnel decisions in the 
same way as other federal employees. And 
unlike the progressive disciplinary system 
applied across other federal agencies, includ-
ing other Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) components, TSOs are subject to a cu-
mulative disciplinary system. 
This is reflective of the unfair barriers to 
pay equity and workplace protections people 
of color and women face as a whole. Due to 
historic injustices such as slavery, segrega-
tion, redlining, unequal access to govern-
ment programs, and ongoing institutional-
ized and systematic discrimination, Black 
men on average make 87 cents on a White 
man’s dollar. Black women face an even larg-
er pay gap on average, making only 63 cents 
for every dollar earned by a White man. At 
the same time, 80 percent of Black mothers 
are the sole, co-breadwinners, or primary 
breadwinners for their households. These 
trends track for the Latino community as 
well. One cause of this disparity is that peo-
ple of color are often overrepresented in 
lower paying professions that yield fewer 
benefits and fewer protections. Removing 
barriers to success and increasing protec-
tions to match those of other federal work-
ers in the TSA, which employs a higher pro-
portion of people of color and a higher pro-
portion of women than the Department of 
Homeland Security overall, is absolutely a 
matter of equity that should be addressed ur-
gently. 
It is past time this disparity is addressed. 
TSOs should have the same fair pay, union 
rights, and treatment as other federal work-
ers. The Rights for the Transportation Security 
Administration Workforce Act of 2022 would 
codify these rights and give long overdue 
workplace protections to TSA officers. The 
National Urban League supports this legisla-
tion and urges you to support it as well. 
Sincerely, 
MARC H. MORIAL, 
President and Chief Executive Officer, 
National Urban League. 
JOI O. CHANEY, 
Executive Director, Washington Bureau, 
Senior Vice President, Policy & Advocacy, 
National Urban League. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, the momentum we need to 
vote this legislation over the finish 
line is there, and I hope my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle will honor the 
work of our brave TSOs and the com-
mitment they have made to them by 
voting for this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 903. When Congress created 
the Transportation Security Adminis-
tration more than 20 years ago in the 
wake of the attacks on 9/11, this body 
provided the TSA Administrator with 
unique authorities in the management 
of its personnel. 
H.R. 903 would eliminate this vital 
flexibility and infringe upon TSA’s 
ability to immediately respond to 
evolving threats and to protect the 
traveling public. 
This bill goes against Congress’ in-
tent by moving an entire agency into

May 12, 2022 
an antiquated 1940s system of title 5 of 
the U.S. Code. TSA will not be able to 
take emerging intelligence and quickly 
change security screening procedures 
at airports without unnecessary and 
dangerous delays due to the collective 
bargaining requirements of this bill. 
Since 9/11, TSA has kept our Nation’s 
transportation system secure. Airport 
screeners and Federal air marshals 
have responded time and time again to 
emerging threats. 
For example, checkpoint screenings 
procedures were changed almost over-
night in response to the liquid explo-
sive plot in 2006 and the personal elec-
tronic device threat in 2017. Such im-
mediate and agile responses will be se-
verely hindered under H.R. 903. Secu-
rity policies should not be subject to 
union bargaining. 
In addition, TSA will no longer be 
able to easily remove employees who 
have committed serious misconduct. If 
a TSA screener is caught smuggling 
drugs or weapons, it will be nearly im-
possible for TSA to immediately termi-
nate them due to the layers of bureauc-
racy in the title 5 system. 
According to TSA, this bill will cost 
an astronomical amount of almost $8 
billion over a 5-year period, and much 
of that money won’t go to the frontline 
personnel. The amount of overhead 
costs associated with moving an entire 
agency to title 5 means that billions of 
dollars will be spent on the transition 
and will require the hiring of hundreds 
of new employees, not frontline work-
ers who would be protecting the trav-
eling public but, instead, bureaucrats 
who will facilitate this massive labor 
relations effort. 
If we actually want to address the 
needs of frontline workers, we would 
focus on securing more funding for 
their pay. Instead, H.R. 903 will waste 
billions in taxpayer dollars to create 
more bureaucracy and provide even 
more money to headquarters and those 
who work there who already have a 
much higher salary than the dedicated 
frontline personnel. 
I am extremely concerned that pass-
ing this bill would create a massive un-
funded mandate that will ultimately 
divert critical funding from other im-
portant DHS priorities like border se-
curity, cybersecurity, and emergency 
response. 
If my friends in the majority were 
truly focused on prioritizing and im-
proving the pay of TSA frontline work-
ers, rather than prioritizing and em-
powering the unions, they would sup-
port frontline pay raises without the 
expense and the unnecessary bureauc-
racy of title 5. 
Unfortunately, the majority rejected 
an amendment by Ranking Member 
KATKO at the markup that would have 
done just that—improve the pay of 
frontline screeners and air marshals, 
not the high-paid bureaucrats at head-
quarters, without all the waste that 
title 5 would provide. 
I and many of my colleagues stand 
ready to raise pay for frontline work-
ers, but I cannot in good conscience 
support a bill that is fiscally irrespon-
sible, undermines our national secu-
rity, hinders the agency’s missions and 
flexibility, and prioritizes the interests 
of the unions over the interests of the 
dedicated frontline workforce and the 
traveling public. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose H.R. 903, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PAYNE). 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 903, the Trans-
portation 
Security 
Administration 
Workforce Act of 2022. 
This bill would provide the TSA 
workforce with opportunities to in-
crease pay, engage in collective bar-
gaining, and appeal disciplinary ac-
tions. It gives TSA workers the same 
workplace rights and protections as 
other Federal workers. 
Currently, the TSA workforce suffers 
from low employee morale and high 
turnover. This bill would allow the 
TSA to better recruit and retain high- 
skilled workers. 
Most importantly for me, it gives a 
COVID–19 hazard bonus pay to employ-
ees who had substantial contact with 
the public during the initial pandemic, 
and it gives them resources to keep 
them safe on the job. 
This bill requires coordination be-
tween the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention with other leading 
medical agencies to provide TSA prop-
er guidance on how best to protect its 
workforce. I have been a strong sup-
porter of more protections and benefits 
for our critical TSA workforce. 
The chairman made it clear early on 
in my arrival here in Congress that 
this issue needed to be addressed. So, I 
introduced a bill, the Hazardous Duty 
Pay for Frontline Federal Workers Act, 
to give this hazard bonus to TSA work-
ers during the pandemic. 
In addition, I helped pass the Rights 
for Transportation Security Officers 
Act to provide TSA workers full collec-
tive bargaining and whistleblower pro-
tection. 
I cosponsored the Rights of the TSA 
Workforce Act to provide them the 
same protections as other Federal 
workers. I also supported President 
Biden’s efforts to increase pay for TSA 
employees and hire more officers at 
airports. 
TSA workers are critical to the safe-
ty of American passengers, our trans-
portation network, and our Nation. We 
need to make sure they get the same 
rights and protections they deserve to 
keep us safe and continue to keep our 
Nation safe for the traveling public. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t understand why 
this one group of Federal workers has 
been pointed out not to deserve the 
same rights every other Federal work-
er has in their position. It makes no 
sense. 
For whatever reason that it was not 
initially there, it is time for them to be 
brought into the system that the rest 
of our workforce is protected by. 
I would like to respond to my col-
league’s argument that TSA should not 
move to title 5 because the system is 
somehow antiquated or imperfect. I un-
derstand that the prior administration 
stood up the blue-ribbon panel that 
recommended against moving the TSA 
workforce to title 5, arguing that it 
would deny the Administrator the 
flexibility to make TSA’s personnel 
system better. Is it worth noting that 
the blue-ribbon panel did not include a 
single labor representative or expert 
with a labor background? This omis-
sion is very telling. 
The truth of the matter is, title 5 of-
fers structured rules for pay, raises, bo-
nuses, collective bargaining rights, dis-
ciplinary actions, and grievances that 
TSA currently lacks in the system. 
Why? Why should they be omitted? 
Title 5 is time-tested and has been 
developed and tweaked carefully over 
the decades. While not a perfect sys-
tem, title 5 is significantly better than 
TSA’s current system in which TSA 
makes up its own rules as it goes 
along. 
TSA has had more than 20 years to 
develop a system that delivers better 
benefits, protections, and compensa-
tion than title 5, and it couldn’t do it. 
How much longer should they wait? 
Notably, even the TSA Blue Ribbon 
Panel recognized that TSA has only 
used its statutory authorities to ben-
efit management and not the frontline 
workers. 
That said, I am pleased to hear inter-
est from my colleagues in improving 
title 5. I would be happy to work with 
them in a bipartisan way to address 
the issues for workers across the Fed-
eral Government. 
In the meantime, we should put TSA 
under the time-tested system that has 
worked so well for most Federal work-
ers.

Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
KATKO). 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 903, the 
Rights for the TSA Workforce Act of 
2022. 
Let me be clear: I strongly and em-
phatically support increasing funding 
for the frontline TSA workforce. I 
strongly support funding for them. 
They have been severely underpaid for 
far too long. 
In fact, Mr. Speaker, there is a blue- 
ribbon panel that came out, that my 
colleague 
referenced, 
that 
rec-
ommended against moving them to the 
title 5 workforce. That blue-ribbon 
panel, to correct the RECORD, included 
the chief human capital officer for the 
Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
under former President Obama. One of 
the top men at the Department of 
Homeland 
Security 
for 
President 
Obama was part of a blue-ribbon panel 
that recommended against that.

Even with that recommendation, I 
am so sick and tired of these frontline 
workers not getting their proper pay 
that I was willing to move title 5 fund-
ing for them. This bill doesn’t do that. 
This bill goes far beyond that. 
Bureaucrats that are sitting in of-
fices nowhere near the front lines, that 
are not exposed to COVID on a daily 
basis, that aren’t fishing live, loaded 
guns out of handbags, and subject to 
all kinds of abuse by the traveling pub-
lic, are going to get title 5 status, and 
they get paid a hell of a lot more. 
Why? Why do we need that? That is a 
question, and that is a problem I have 
with this bill. 
The 
men 
and 
women 
protecting 
America’s 
transportation 
systems 
every day deserve to be compensated 
fairly for the critical security mission 
they fulfill. 
Unfortunately, despite robust efforts 
to improve this legislation in markup, 
and limited to the terms I articulated, 
my fellow committee members and I on 
the Republican side were not granted 
the adoption of a single proposed 
amendment. 
Among the improvements we sug-
gested were quite simply an amend-
ment to limit the scope of the bill ex-
clusively to the frontline TSA work-
force, the men and women who really 
need better pay, rather than already 
high-paid TSA headquarter personnel. 
I am telling you on the record today, 
if the bill was limited to just them, I 
would support it. Why do we have to 
make it for everyone else? 60,000 peo-
ple. Why? It makes no sense. 
Our 
proposed 
amendments 
also 
sought to grant increased pay directly 
to the front line, without the need for 
cumbersome and costly bureaucratic 
conversion to title 5. 
Uncharacteristically, 
the 
message 
from the majority was clear: Take it or 
leave it. That is very uncharacteristic, 
because the chairman and I enjoy a 
very good working relationship. For 
that reason, though, I am unable to 
support the legislation in its current 
form. 
With that said, however, I do hope to 
work in a bipartisan manner to secure 
much-needed funding increases for TSA 
in order to lift pay and benefits for the 
frontline screener workforce as well as 
procure cutting-edge technologies to 
address evolving threats to aviation se-
curity. 
I am pleased to see dedicated funding 
for significant screener pay increases 
in this year’s budget request to Con-
gress. I stand ready to work with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
engage our colleagues on the House Ap-
propriations Committee in an effort to 
secure funding for transportation secu-
rity officer pay. 
I include in the RECORD a letter to 
our friends and colleagues on the Ap-
propriations Committee outlining just 
that. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, May 12, 2022. 
Hon. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
Chair, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, 
Committee on Appropriations, Washington, 
DC. 
Hon. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN, 
Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Homeland 
Security, 
Committee 
on 
Appropriations, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR ROYBAL-ALLARD AND RANKING 
MEMBER FLEISCHMANN: Thank you for your 
continued work to support the mission of the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and 
protect our Nation from a litany of evolving 
threats. As the House considers H.R. 903, the 
Rights for the TSA Workforce Act of 2022, I 
wanted to follow up on my previous letter 
dated April 28, 2022, related to homeland se-
curity funding priorities. 
The FY23 President’s Budget requests 
funding for increased pay for the Transpor-
tation Security Administration (TSA) front- 
line workforce. As I’ve said many times dur-
ing my years in Congress, TSA has not paid 
these dedicated employees a salary that is 
commensurate to the security they’re pro-
viding to the traveling public. 
Additionally, I have long raised concerns 
that TSA has not fully utilized the flexi-
bility that Congress provided in the Aviation 
and Transportation Security Act (ATSA, 
Public Law 107–71). The bipartisan Blue-Rib-
bon Panel on Human Capital Service Deliv-
ery found that the TSA Administrator cur-
rently has the flexibility under ATSA to pay 
employees more than he could if the agency 
was moved to title 5, U.S. Code. This is an 
issue of funding, not authority. 
The cost to the taxpayer of funding a 
major overhaul of TSA’s entire personnel 
system, converting the agency to the Gen-
eral Schedule, and hiring hundreds of new 
employees to manage and negotiate these 
changes is far greater than the cost of sim-
ply giving the frontline workforce a well-de-
served pay increase. As it currently stands, 
H.R. 903 creates a massive and unfunded 
mandate that could jeopardize other home-
land security priorities such as border secu-
rity and cybersecurity if enacted as written. 
I encourage you to consider including fund-
ing in the FY23 Homeland Security Appro-
priations Bill to increase the pay of the TSA 
front-line workforce. TSA plays a funda-
mental role in protecting the traveling pub-
lic and facilitating the safe flow of com-
merce throughout the country. 
Thank you for your time and consideration 
of this request. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN KATKO, 
Member of Congress. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend and colleague, the vice rank-
ing member of the Homeland Security 
Committee, Representative GUEST, for 
his leadership on this issue. 
I also thank my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle for engaging in 
conversations, even when we disagree 
on policy. But here I really feel that 
the bill in its current form will go over 
to the Senate, and it will be dead on ar-
rival. That serves nobody. No one wins 
in that, and certainly the frontline 
workers don’t win. 
If we could get a more bipartisan bill, 
with a lot more of us that want to be 
on this and want to help the frontline 
workers, I think we would have a bet-
ter product and we could put more 
pressure on the Senate to do their job. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see my col-
league, the ranking member. But let 
me just correct him on his correction 
of the gentleman from New Jersey. A 
person that works in the Department 
of Homeland Security is not a labor 
representative. The labor representa-
tive that Mr. PAYNE referenced is an 
organized labor representative with the 
AFL–CIO. 
The other thing my ranking member 
can do, he will have a chance to vote 
on the President’s budget. The raise for 
the employees is in the budget. I look 
forward to that opportunity presenting 
itself. Our TSOs need a raise. If we 
don’t, the gymnastics here on the floor 
doesn’t pay rent, doesn’t pay mortgage, 
doesn’t pay tuition, doesn’t even buy 
groceries. 
So at the end of the day, let’s give 
these good folks who do a good job an 
honest day’s pay for an honest day’s 
work. That is the spirit in which this 
legislation is put forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), a senior member of the Homeland 
Security Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman of this committee 
and the ranking member on the floor, 
and let me express my appreciation for 
his acknowledgment and recognition 
that we should do something. I know 
he wants to do something. I am going 
to try to encourage him to do some-
thing to alter his position and to stand 
with this legislation. 
I want to take a moment to present 
tribute and accolades, as should be, 
though he never asked for such, to our 
chairman. I cannot remember a day 
that he did not gather us to meet with 
the transportation security officers, 
the American Federation of Govern-
ment Employees, and others, over a 
decade maybe, as I chaired the Trans-
portation Security Committee of the 
Homeland Security Committee, where 
he has not worked without ceasing, we 
have not joined him without ceasing, 
to be able to rectify this injustice. 
That is what it is. It is a plain and sim-
ple injustice. 
I stand on this floor, in the name of 
Gerardo Hernandez, from the Los Ange-
les airport, who died in the line of duty 
as a TSA officer. We met his family. 
We mourn with them. We mourn with 
those who suffer. 
We mourn with those who lost their 
lives in the pandemic, front line, really 
front line, because before this was even 
diagnosed, there were COVID patients 
or 
COVID-infected 
persons 
going 
through airports, and our TSOs had no 
experience, protection, and they were 
becoming infected by the dozens, and 
many died. 
So breaking news today. This is a 
breaking news story. This legislation 
now comes to remedy and solve the 
problem we have needed to fix, really 
since 9/11 and the creation of the De-
partment of Homeland Security. 
Specifically, the bill within 180 days 
eliminates personnel authorities of the

Department of Homeland Security and 
the Department of Transportation gov-
erning the conditions of employment of 
TSA employees, thus making TSA em-
ployees subject to the personnel man-
agement system applicable to other 
Federal employees. 
Justice, fairness, the removal of in-
justice, sets forth transition rules that 
protect the pay rates, leave rights and 
other rights of TSA employees, and re-
quires DHS to consult with the labor 
organizations certified by the Federal 
Labor Relations Authority to carry out 
the conversion of such positions. 
Let me be very clear: Those persons 
sitting at desks may wind up in some 
airport in the midst of crisis. How do I 
know? During Hurricane Harvey, tens 
upon tens of TSA and TSO officers flew 
into Houston because our officers were 
desperate, suffering from this cata-
strophic flood and rain. 
So it should be across the board. It is 
fair. It should be no different from 
other Federal employees. The bill di-
rects the TSA to consult with public 
and private entities associated with 
the Federal air marshals to address 
concerns regarding Federal air mar-
shals, including mental health and sui-
cide rates. Absolutely imperative. 
I went to the office of the Federal air 
marshals when they were under stress, 
and they thought that they were im-
ploding. The atmosphere of flying, the 
hours, and the lack of sensitivity of 
those hours, drove mental health cases 
among the Federal air marshals. We 
went to tell them that they were im-
portant and that we were going to 
work on this. 
How long must we wait? This bill 
prohibits TSA employees from using or 
installing the social media video appli-
cation TikTok on U.S. Government- 
issued mobile devices, cleaning things 
up; requires DHS to prioritize the hir-
ing of veterans, including disabled vet-
erans; and directs the TSA to ensure 
its employees are provided proper guid-
ance regarding prevention and protec-
tions against the coronavirus. 
But what it also does is retention. Do 
you know how much rotation goes on 
with these TSOs? We bring them in 
young. Every time I go to airports 
across America, they are the ones that 
I stop and talk to. ‘‘How long have you 
been here?’’ I applaud them when they 
say: ‘‘We came in one year after.’’ ‘‘We 
came in the same year.’’ I say: ‘‘You 
are lifers. Thank you for your service.’’ 
We try to encourage younger persons 
to understand that they are on the 
front lines saving lives, because as our 
chairman said, every day they are 
picking up guns and various other 
things that can be a danger to the trav-
eling public. It is crucial that we recog-
nize this. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
acknowledge, again, the shooting inci-
dent of Gerardo Hernandez, who be-
came the first officer killed in the line 
of duty. There was the machete attack 
at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans 
International Airport that resulted in 
injury to Senior Transportation Secu-
rity Officer Carol Richel. 
This bill represents longstanding pri-
ority. It is breaking news. I stand with 
TSOs, and I stand with the TSA. It is 
long overdue. They saved us after 9/11. 
They came in and stood in the gap. We 
must fix the morale. We must get rid of 
the allegation of mismanagement and 
wasteful 
procedures, 
retaliation 
against whistleblowers, low morale, 
and security gaps within the agency. 
This will do that. 
So I ask my colleagues to support it. 
I am on the Budget Committee, and it 
is paid for. This is going to be the path-
way of professionalism at the airport, 
saving lives, protecting the public, and 
ensuring that we have a professional, 
young, and growing team that is going 
to be part of America’s front lines. I 
ask my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
903, Rights for the TSA Workforce Act, which 
bill modifies the workplace rights, protections, 
and benefits applicable to Transportation Se-
curity Administration (TSA) personnel. 
Specifically, the bill: 
Within 180 days, eliminates personnel au-
thorities of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity (DHS) and theDepartment of Transpor-
tation governing the conditions of employment 
for TSA employees, thus making TSA employ-
ees subject to the personnel management 
system applicable to other federal employees; 
Sets forth transition rules that protect the 
pay rates, leave rights, and other rights of 
TSA employees; and 
Requires DHS to consult with the labor or-
ganization certified by the Federal Labor Rela-
tions Authority to carry out the conversion of 
such positions. 
The bill also: 
Directs the TSA to consult with public and 
private entities associated with the Federal Air 
Marshal Service to address concerns regard-
ing federal air marshals, including mental 
health and suicide rates; 
Prohibits TSA employees from using or in-
stalling the social media video application 
TikTok on U.S.government-issued mobile de-
vices; 
Requires DHS to prioritize the hiring of vet-
erans, including disabled veterans; and 
Directs the TSA to ensure its employees are 
provided proper guidance regarding prevention 
and protections against the coronavirus (i.e., 
the virus that causes COVID–19). 
I view the work of the TSA as vital to our 
Nation’s homeland security. 
The agency mission is to protect the Na-
tion’s transportation systems to ensure free-
dom of movement for people and commerce. 
The Committee on Homeland Security pro-
vides the needed policy guidance and funding 
to ensure that the TSA has what it needs to 
create and sustain the most effective transpor-
tation security as a high performing counterter-
rorism organization. 
The work of the TSA is a front-line Depart-
ment of Homeland Security and it is not 
easy—it can, in fact, be very dangerous. 
Like many of my colleagues, I recall the 
shooting incident at LAX that killed Gerardo 
Hernandez, who became the first TSA officer 
killed in the line of duty; and the machete at-
tack at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans 
International Airport that resulted in injuries to 
Senior Transportation Security Officer Carol 
Richel. 
These incidents only highlight the difficult 
work that the men and women of the TSA 
must perform each day to keep our Nation’s 
airports and flights safe. 
The bill represents a longstanding priority, 
since the time I chaired the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee Subcommittee on Transpor-
tation Security to extend to TSA employees 
the same rights and protections afforded to all 
federal government employees. The legislation 
curtails TSA’s broad authorities to create and 
control its personnel systems, instead requir-
ing TSA to abide by the provisions of title 5 
which regulate personnel systems for most 
Federal agencies. 
The bill would provide TSA employees with 
the workforce protections and benefits avail-
able to most other Federal workers. 
The bill sets forth transition rules to protect 
the rate of pay and other rights of TSA em-
ployees during a transition to title 5. 
The bill also requires the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to consult with the appro-
priate labor organizations to carry out the tran-
sition. This bill does not affect prohibitions 
against disloyalty and asserting the right to 
strike against the federal government. 
The bill also extends the timeline for the 
transition from 60 days to a more realistic 180 
days, and it contains language to protect em-
ployees with grievances or disciplinary actions 
pending during the transition. 
Following terrorist attacks of September 11, 
2001, there was urgency to have a whole of 
government response to secure the Nation’s 
commercial aviation. 
On that day, nearly 3,000 people were killed 
in a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in 
New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. 
The attacks resulted in the creation of the 
Transportation Security Administration, which 
was designed to prevent similar attacks in the 
future by removing the responsibility for trans-
portation security from private entities. 
The Aviation and Transportation Security 
Act, passed by the 107th Congress and 
signed on November 19, 2001, established 
TSA just 2 months following the September 
11, 2001 attacks. 
The urgent need to provide a response to 
the available security threat was facing meant 
that much of the work to provide administra-
tive structure and integration measures that 
would have woven in the civil service protec-
tions now be added did not occur at that time. 
The urgency of establishing TSA created 
another type of federal employee with no job 
security, worker rights, and ability to advance 
within the federal workforce. 
The consequences of these shortcomings is 
high turnover, low morale, and higher costs for 
training and retaining personnel that is under-
mining the security we need for air travelers. 
It is past time to make the changes provided 
by H.R. 1140, so the TSA workforce is treated 
equally to other federal employees with the 
power to advance and expand their opportuni-
ties as government employees. 
Allegations about mismanagement, wasteful 
procedures, retaliation against whistleblowers,

low morale, and security gaps within the 
Agency are causes for concern. 
TSA has consistently struggled with low mo-
rale across the workforce, ranking 303 out of 
305 government agencies in 2016. 
Low morale has a nexus to the high turn-
over rate within the ranks of Transportation 
Security Officers (TSOs). 
TSOs represent 70 percent of the TSA 
workforce, yet have been denied full collective 
bargaining rights, whistleblower protections, 
and opportunities to effectively raise issues in 
dispute to an independent third party, such as 
the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
Additionally, TSOs are subject to a pay and 
performance system that does not track with 
the General Services (GS) wage system, the 
primary wage system for Federal workers. 
In order to move the workforce forward and 
see the necessary changes envisioned, it is 
imperative for TSA’s frontline personnel re-
ceive these critical protections. 
This is an essential bill that must be sent to 
the President’s desk because it will strengthen 
transportation security by removing barriers 
that are undermining retention and profes-
sional development at the TSA. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in voting in 
favor of HR. 903. 
Thank you. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOODEN). 
Mr. GOODEN OF Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my colleague from Texas for 
stating so eloquently what I and I be-
lieve everyone in this Chamber agrees 
with, and that is that the TSA agents, 
the men and women who work for the 
American people at the airport, are 
protecting our Nation. 
They are on the front lines, which is 
why I am rising today to urge my col-
leagues to do something very simple, 
and that is to protect Americans from 
terrorists 
and 
dangerous 
criminals 
when they fly and to assist the TSA by 
taking away a very dangerous policy 
that they have enacted from the top 
that they are encouraging and forcing 
these agents on the front lines to deal 
with. That policy is one of allowing il-
legal aliens onto commercial aircraft 
without proper identification. 
It was confirmed to me from the TSA 
administrator that migrants are al-
lowed to use arrest warrants and war-
rants for deportation to board flights 
alongside everyday travelers. This was 
confirmed to me before Christmas last 
year. Despite my demands and those of 
many of my colleagues, the Biden ad-
ministration has done nothing to stop 
this. Anyone in this country illegally, 
or with a warrant for arrest, should be 
detained and brought before a judge, 
not permitted to travel to the city of 
their choice. 
This should be a commonsense re-
quest. I will remind my colleagues that 
the TSA was created in response to the 
September 11 attacks, but it seems as 
if we have forgotten that. The lax poli-
cies by the TSA that allow unvetted 
aliens to board flights without identi-
fication presents a serious national se-
curity threat each and every day and 
jeopardizes the lives of the American 
people. 
My constituents, and I would venture 
to argue those of my colleagues, per-
haps some of my open border friends 
across the aisle, would agree that our 
constituents deserve to fly in a safe 
aircraft. 
b 1300 
My constituents have to pull out an 
ID to board a flight, but this TSA has 
said that if you have an arrest warrant, 
that is good enough to get through se-
curity. I think that is crazy, and I 
think the American people do as well. 
I introduced this motion to recommit 
to protect our skies, verify the identity 
of travelers, and notify law enforce-
ment if someone is in our country ille-
gally. 
There is zero excuse to delay when 
the ongoing border crisis is putting 
every single community in our Nation 
at risk. In just 10 months, the Biden 
administration allowed over 45,000 non-
citizens to fly without an ID, nearly 160 
passengers each and every day. We also 
know this administration is allowing 
people on the terrorist watch list into 
our country, and we have no clue who 
is boarding these flights. 
I urge my colleagues to protect our 
airways and prevent another tragedy 
like 9/11 from occurring by adopting 
this motion. 
Mr. Speaker, if we adopt the motion 
to recommit, we will instruct the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security to con-
sider my amendment to H.R. 903 to pro-
hibit the TSA from accepting docu-
ments such as an arrest warrant or no-
tice to appear as a valid form of identi-
fication. I ask unanimous consent to 
insert the text of the amendment in 
the RECORD immediately prior to the 
vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As a 
point of information, Mr. THOMPSON 
has 8 minutes remaining, and Mr. 
GUEST has 181⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, for the RECORD, title 5 will 
prevent the misconduct we have seen 
at TSA, such as senior managers 
awarding each other over $90,000 in bo-
nuses. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear that 
all Republicans support increasing the 
pay of our TSA frontline workers. We 
know that they are crucial to the secu-
rity of our traveling public. 
But this bill that we are here debat-
ing is not a bill that deals specifically 
with that. If that were the case, in 
markup 
Ranking 
Member 
KATKO’s 
amendment, an amendment that would 
have provided a $3,000 immediate sal-
ary increase to all frontline workers, 5 
percent raise on top of that, year one; 
year 2, a 3 percent raise; year 3, a 3 per-
cent raise; year 4, a 4 percent raise. 
This bill that we are talking about 
today is a bill that is not just to in-
crease pay, which we all agree on, but 
this is, instead, a labor bill. This is, in-
stead, an attempt to unionize an entire 
Federal agency. 
Mr. PAYNE spoke about that a little 
bit when he got up a few moments ago 
when he talked about the blue-ribbon 
committee that was established and 
said that there was not one labor lead-
er on that committee. We shouldn’t be 
putting labor leaders in the position of 
putting them on committees where we 
are talking about protecting the trav-
eling public. That committee that he 
referred to, in 2019 TSA received a re-
port from that bipartisan committee— 
and I stress that it was a bipartisan 
committee, the Blue Ribbon Panel Re-
viewing TSA Human Capital Service 
Delivery. The panel was composed of 
former officials from both Democratic 
and Republican administrations and in-
cluded the chief human capital officer 
for 
DHS 
under 
former 
President 
Obama. 
It says that they strongly—not just 
recommended, but they strongly rec-
ommended against moving TSA per-
sonnel under title 5, and then this is a 
quote directly from that report, and it 
says here, ‘‘One recommendation the 
panel heard repeatedly from employees 
was moving TSA into the General 
Schedule (GS). The Panel does not 
agree. The General Schedule is a 70- 
year-old classification and compensa-
tion system from the last century and 
is the subject of countless studies and 
recommendations from good govern-
ment organizations who consistently 
find it is too inflexible to meet the 
needs of the 21st century workforce. A 
better course of action is to use exist-
ing ATSA flexibility to improve the 
TSA pay system so that it operates at 
a level superior to the GS system.’’ 
Those are not my words. Those are 
not the words of Republicans. Those 
are the words of a blue-ribbon com-
mittee which was established to study 
this very thing. Here we see that Con-
gress is going to completely ignore the 
findings of that committee. We are 
going to ignore a committee made up 
of TSA workers, employees, personnel, 
and supervisors who served on a com-
mittee that was established to look at 
this very point, and we are going to 
completely ignore that. 
We are going to now do exactly what 
this committee recommended against. 
And we are doing that not because we 
want to increase the pay of the front-
line workers, which again we all agree 
on and we all support. We would sup-
port a bill today that would do that 
without putting everyone under title 5. 
But what this bill is, this is an attempt 
to unionize an entire Federal agency 
and a bill which would make the trav-
eling public less safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4887 
May 12, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, for the RECORD, title 5 
is not a union. It is a personnel system. 
It means that if you have rights as an 
employee of the Federal Government, 
you know what those rights are. That 
is not a union. 
Now, for TSOs who voted to have a 
bargaining unit, and they chose the 
American Federation of Government 
Employees to be their bargaining unit, 
that is all. In America, people have 
choices. Our TSOs decided that they 
wanted to have union representation, 
which in America, in a democracy, is 
their right. I respect that right, and 
they have done it. 
Now we have to treat them like all 
other Federal employees. That is just 
what this bill does. There is nothing 
else here. It just puts them under title 
5 just like every other national secu-
rity-related law enforcement agency, 
and we are in good shape, so they can 
pay their mortgages, they can pay 
their rent, they can do for their chil-
dren like other Federal employees, 
plain and simple. Not a big deal. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CORREA), a subcommittee chairman of 
the Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman. I won’t need 5 minutes 
because this is essentially common-
sense legislation. I rise in strong sup-
port of this measure. 
Title 5, unions. What is wrong with 
unions? Our Border Patrol officers are 
unionized. Our local police officers are 
unionized. Our local sheriffs are union-
ized, and countless other public safety 
officers are unionized. 
TSA employees, 9/11. It has been 
more than 20 years, but people like me, 
I still remember 9/11. I still remember 
those pictures of firefighters and police 
officers, unionized, running into these 
burning buildings in New York City. 
Those officers and firefighters knew 
they were going to perish that day, but 
they ran in to save American lives. 
We don’t want another 9/11 to happen 
again. Heaven forbid. But this is what 
the TSA officers are all about, pre-
venting another 9/11. 
Every time I get on a plane, every 
time my family gets on a plane, you 
hope to God that those TSO officers, 
TSA officers do their jobs, make sure 
that nothing terrible gets on a flight, 
make sure that there is order, and you 
want that officer on that line, on that 
front line, to do their job correctly. 
You want an experienced officer, you 
want an experienced officer who has 
been there for years. You don’t want an 
officer who has been there a few 
months waiting for another job because 
that job doesn’t pay him enough. You 
don’t want that officer to look for an-
other job because he is not trained cor-
rectly. You want a trained, profes-
sional workforce. 
That is really what this measure is 
about, preventing another 9/11. How? 
Making sure that those frontline TSA 
workers, 
employees 
are 
prepared, 
trained, and know what they are doing. 
Commonsense legislation. I ask my 
colleagues to please support safety in 
the skies, safety for our families. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I close by thanking the 
men and women of TSA, especially the 
screeners, air marshals, and other 
frontline workers. 
The debate we are having today does 
not impact the sincere appreciation we 
have for the tremendous job they do 
each and every day to secure the trans-
portation system. 
While we disagree on the best way 
forward, we all share the same goal of 
improving the pay and morale for TSA 
frontline workforce. It is important 
not only for the success of the agency 
but for the security of our Nation. Un-
fortunately, this bill is not the answer, 
and, therefore, I cannot support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose H.R. 903, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, the policies with ref-
erence to flying on planes have re-
mained consistent under successive ad-
ministrations of both parties, including 
the Trump administration. These pas-
sengers have their identities verified 
through CBP and ICE and received en-
hanced screening. If the individuals are 
on the terrorist watch list and they are 
not U.S. citizens, they are transferred 
to ICE for title 8 processing and deten-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the robust 
debate we have had today for this legis-
lation and amendments my colleagues 
will be offering that seek to improve 
the bill. But you can’t spend thanks. If 
I told a TSO, ‘‘Thank you for your 
service,’’ almost to the person, they 
would say, ‘‘Then give me a raise. 
Treat me like all other Federal em-
ployees.’’ 
As our country emerges from what 
we hope is the worst of the COVID–19 
pandemic, we cannot forget about the 
TSOs, air marshals, and others within 
TSA who never paused their work in 
service of our national security. 
With estimates that the number of 
passengers who travel through airports 
in 
fiscal 
year 
2023 
will 
exceed 
prepandemic figures by 4.5 percent, we 
are again asking them to do more than 
ever and not pay them any additional 
money. Treat them like everybody 
else. Passage of this legislation will 
send a clear signal that we acknowl-
edge their commitment and agree they 
deserve the compensation and work-
place protection that reflects that. 
In this country, you pay for what you 
get. Pay our TSOs what they deserve 
and treat them like all other Federal 
employees. A 30 percent increase is 
what this bill would do for our TSOs, 
and they deserve it. They have earned 
it. I thank my colleagues for their sup-
port and urge passage of H.R. 903. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Each further amendment printed in

ant to House Resolution 1097, the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP-
SON) and the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi (Mr. GUEST) each will control 
10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Mississippi. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of these 
amendments which seek to improve the 
work experiences of TSA employees, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. While I 
appreciate some of the issues my ma-
jority colleagues seek to address in 
this en bloc amendment, the bottom 
line is, there is nothing that will im-
prove the bill or address the multiple 
concerns I have in it. 
Nothing in this en bloc amendment 
will preserve TSA’s flexible authority 
to implement immediate security pro-
cedures in the face of national security 
threats. Nothing in this en bloc will en-
sure that screeners who commit gross 
misconduct are immediately relieved 
of their duties. Nothing in this en bloc 
will protect the rest of the Department 
of Homeland Security from having its 
key mission areas—like border secu-
rity, cybersecurity, and counterterror-
ism vetting—from being raided to pay 
for this massive unfunded mandate. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this en bloc amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I would 
begin by thanking Chairman THOMPSON 
and Chairwoman MALONEY
and, of 
course, the committee staff, for really 
working 
on 
these 
two 
important 
amendments that protect our Federal 
employees within the TSA. 
My team and I are proud to have 
worked with many workers on the 
ground at our Detroit Metro Airport, 
one of the most busiest in the country, 
including Gregory Simpkins, as well as 
coworkers that met with me about 
these really important items. The 
amendments directly respond to issues 
that they brought to my attention, 
specifically on their lived experiences 
as TSA employees. 
One major issue that we brought up 
in an amendment is that TSA is one of 
the most diverse Federal agencies in 
our country at its lower level, but its 
leadership is far less diverse and the 
agency has struggled with employee re-
tention and promotions from within. 
Thanks to the leadership of Chair-
man THOMPSON and others, our amend-
ment takes a step towards addressing 
the issue by directing that we examine 
the current promotion policies and 
leadership diversity at the TSA and 
provide recommendations aimed at im-
proving the diversity of TSA leader-
ship, as well as strategies for how the 
TSA can better retain and promote 
current employees into leadership posi-
tions. 
Mr. Speaker, another major issue 
brought up by many of the members of 
the Local 778 of AFGE specifically, was 
the shocking levels of harassment and 
violence experienced by TSA employ-
ees in their workplace. So we address it 
with an amendment before us that re-
quires that we examine TSA’s efforts 
right now to ensure the safety of its 
employees with regard to harassment 
and assault in the workplace, including 
incidents where the alleged perpetrator 
is a member of the general public, and 
develop recommendations of how TSA 
can better protect its employees. 
This amendment would center its re-
view process around employees them-
selves, documenting their experiences, 
getting the feedback to truly improve 
the safety of their workplace, and fac-
tor into it the final recommendations 
that we would hopefully bring to this 
body. 
I urge my colleagues to truly make 
this is a safe place for many of our 
neighbors—many of them, again, work-
ing in these sometimes challenging ex-
periences at the airports and at these 
ports. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, 
again, to support these two common-
sense amendments. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON). 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, the job 
of a Federal air marshal is exhausting 
and isolating. 
Data from the Air Marshal Associa-
tion show that air marshals are at high 
risk for extreme fatigue due to the long 
hours they spend on planes and their 
irregular sleep schedules. Many mar-
shals also report mental health issues 
and a reliance on medications and alco-
hol to fall asleep. 
Tragically, several marshals have 
died by suicide in the last decade, in-
cluding three officers in the last 3 
years who were assigned to the Wash-
ington, D.C., field office and served out 
of National Airport. 
We here in Congress know firsthand 
how important it is to ensure that law 
enforcement officers have access to 
mental and peer support, and I am very 
glad H.R. 903 includes provisions that

allow TSA to work with air marshals 
to address mental health and suicide 
rates. 
My amendment simply ensures that 
work schedules, rest periods, equip-
ment, and training are also a part of 
that conversation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for my 
amendment. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I support these amend-
ments en bloc consisting of amend-
ments from my colleagues from Michi-
gan, Virginia, Indiana, New Jersey, and 
New York. 
These amendments, like the entire 
bill, requires TSA to engage its work-
force, hear employee concerns, and 
make improvements in the service of 
our homeland security. 
As we have heard today, morale and 
retention at TSA are alarmingly low. 
This is even more alarming when con-
sidering the fact that TSA is a major-
ity-minority 
workforce, 
with 
more 
than half its workers identifying as 
people of color. It is important that 
TSA employees have a safe workplace, 
free of harassment, and that agency 
leadership reflects the diversity of its 
workforce as well. 
These amendments offer solutions to 
real problems faced by TSA employees, 
such as commuting challenges at air-
ports, as they go about their critical 
mission to keep air travel secure for 
the American people. 
I thank my colleagues for offering 
these amendments, and I urge the 
House to join me in supporting them. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to oppose the amendments 
en bloc, and I yield back the balance of

AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MRS. CAMMACK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 3 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
320. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 14. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION RELATING TO 
SCREENING PROCEDURES AND RE-
QUIREMENTS TO ADDRESS A NA-
TIONAL SECURITY OR PUBLIC SAFE-
TY THREAT. 
Nothing in this Act may be construed to 
limit the Administrator’s authority to im-
pose without delay new security screening 
procedures or requirements, or change, alter, 
or modify existing security screening proce-
dures or requirements, to address a national 
security or public safety threat, as deter-
mined by the Administrator, without regard 
to collective bargaining under chapter 71 of 
title 5, United States Code. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1097, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CAMMACK) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment is sim-
ple. It prioritizes national security at 
TSA. I have concerns about the under-
lying bill, including its expansion of 
collective bargaining that could put 
our national security at risk by sub-
jecting new procedures or requirements 
imposed by the Administrator of the 
TSA to collective bargaining. 
This amendment, like I said, is sim-
ple. It would just clarify that the Ad-
ministrator of TSA is not limited in 
his or her ability to swiftly respond to 
national security and/or public safety 
threats under this bill. 
Specifically, the amendment ensures 
that any procedures or requirements 
shall not be constrained by collective 
bargaining. The very nature of airport 
security requires that TSA remain 
agile and flexible to new and emerging 
threats. It is for this very reason that 
Congress exempted TSA from title 5 
when it stood up the agency just two 
months after the terrorist attacks on 
9/11. 
It is imperative that the Adminis-
trator continues to have the authority 
to swiftly make these changes to en-
sure public safety in response to na-
tional security threats and risks. Now, 
this amendment would ensure that the 
Administrator does not have to nego-
tiate with union representatives when-
ever changes would impact the TSA 
workforce regardless of the national se-
curity implications. It adds language 
that specifically preserves the Admin-
istrator’s 
authority 
and 
exempts 
changes to security screening proce-
dures from collective bargaining. 
We all are exceptionally grateful and 
appreciative for the work that our TSA 
officers do and the national security 
service that they provide, which is ex-
actly why we need this amendment to 
ensure our national security. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
clarifying amendment to ensure that 
national security threats are addressed 
immediately at TSA, their prime mis-
sion, and not let collective bargaining 
get in the way of our national security. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment, which is 
unnecessary and failed on a bipartisan 
vote during the Committee on Home-
land Security’s markup of this bill. 
Law enforcement across Federal Gov-
ernment, as well as State and local, 
have benefited from collective bar-
gaining representation without any 
harm to national security. This amend-
ment seeks to have TSA treated dif-
ferently from other Department of 
Homeland Security components with 
union representation, like U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection. 
This amendment is inconsistent with 
the goal of the underlying bill, which is 
to ensure that TSA workforce is treat-
ed like all other Federal employees— 
equally. 
Further, this amendment is unneces-
sary because under section 7106 of title 
5, the Administrator is already granted 
this power to, ‘‘take whatever actions 
may be necessary to carry out the 
agency mission during emergencies.’’ 
The same provision would preserve 
TSA’s authority to hire, remove, or to 
assign work employees to fulfill an 
agency’s mission. 
So if the law is clear, why is this 
amendment being offered? The answer 
is simple. Many here want to avoid 
talking about the real issue, which is 
the need to improve compensation and 
benefits for frontline TSA workers. I 
would propose that an untrained, inex-
perienced frontline TSA worker is not 
good for our national security. 
Collective bargaining adds to our na-
tional security. Unions like those rep-
resenting CBP employees would pro-
tect the rights of dedicated TSA em-
ployees who have come to work with-

downs. 
If we as a society respect these work-
ers, we will give them the right to col-
lectively bargain and treat them like 
we should; that is, a trusted, profes-
sional workforce that protect us and 
our families on an everyday basis. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from the great State of Mis-
sissippi (Mr. GUEST).

Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, again, 
these arguments go to further what we 
talked about earlier. This bill is not 
about a pay increase for our frontline 
workers. This isn’t a bill about pro-
tecting the traveling public. This is a 
bill about unionizing an entire Federal 
agency. 
My friends across the aisle say that 
TSA already has the authority to do 
what

May 12, 2022 
amendment sets forth. What is the 
harm in putting that in the body of the 
legislation itself? 
Should it not be clear to everyone 
who reads the legislation that collec-
tive bargaining should not hold up im-
provement to security? Should that 
not be made clear? 
Should we not set forth that they al-
ready have that? What harm does it do 
in setting that forth again? 
Again, we all want to see that our 
TSA frontline workers get the pay 
raise that they need and deserve. What 
we oppose on the Republican side is the 
complete unionization of this Federal 
agency. 
I will tell you that this is a critical 
amendment to our national security. 
Historically, we look back, and when 
Congress stood up TSA in the wake of 
9/11, they deliberately provided flexi-
bility to the agency to deal with the 
evolving threats to our transportation 
system. It is imperative that the TSA 
Administrator maintain that authority 
to make immediate changes to screen-
ing procedures when addressing na-
tional security threats. 
The amendment of my good friend 
from Florida simply preserves that au-
thority and makes it clear that the Ad-
ministrator has that authority and ex-
empts security procedures from the 
collective bargaining process. 
Without this critical amendment, se-
curity changes like those made in re-
sponse to the 2006 liquid explosives or 
the 2017 personal electronic device plot 
could be significantly hampered or de-
layed if subject to collective bar-
gaining. We simply cannot afford to 
put our national security on the bar-
gaining table. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida for leading this important issue, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I appreciate the commentary from 
my colleague and friend, Representa-
tive GUEST from Mississippi. What is 
the harm of this amendment if what 
you say is true? If you believe that it is 
currently in place, why is the majority 
opposed to codifying it to ensure that 
national security remains the top pri-
ority? 
It seems very simple to me. This is a 
simple amendment. This is not a par-
tisan amendment. This should be an 
American, bipartisan amendment that 
we can all agree that national security 
comes first. That is the role of TSA. 
My question and statement as I close 
is: Why not codify it? Why not accept 
this amendment? 
I just feel that sometimes we are so 
hyperpartisan in this Chamber that we 
can’t see the forest for the trees. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support and adopt this 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank my colleagues from Florida 
and Mississippi for this good debate. 
Let me answer their question directly 
to the point. They talk about prior-
ities, 
national 
security. 
But 
this 
amendment only applies to TSA em-
ployees. It doesn’t apply to other Fed-
eral employees or other members of 
Homeland Security. 
If this amendment was really about 
national security, you ought to have it 
apply to all Federal employees, not 
just TSA employees. That is why this 
is a red herring. 
Bottom line, again, I am going to re-
peat: Section 7106 of title 5 grants to 
administrators of these agencies the 
power to ‘‘take whatever actions may 
be necessary to carry out the agency 
mission during emergencies.’’ 
Bottom line, this is an antiunion 
amendment. It is unnecessary and in-
sulting to the dedicated professional 
employees of the Transportation Secu-
rity Administration. TSA employees 
should not be treated differently from 
other Federal agency workers who 
have the right to collectively bargain. 
Those advocating for this antiunion 
amendment forget that for the Border 
Patrol agents and the Bureau of Pris-
ons employees who have similar secu-
rity and screening functions, they are 
also unionized. 
TSA itself has told us many times 
that this bill does not create security 
problems. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject this amendment, just as my col-
leagues did when it was rejected in 
committee. I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
having expired, pursuant to House Res-
olution 1097, the previous question is 
ordered on the amendment offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
CAMMACK). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Mrs. CAMMACK). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MR. GUEST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 5 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
320. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 14. SUNSET WITHOUT APPROPRIATIONS. 
This Act and all requirements therein shall 
sunset at the end of fiscal year 2022 if suffi-
cient funds have not been specifically appro-
priated to carry out this Act and such re-
quirements. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1097, the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. GUEST) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Mississippi. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
My amendment would sunset the re-
quirements of H.R. 903 at the end of fis-
cal year 2022 if Congress does not ap-
propriate sufficient funds to carry out 
the bill. 
With H.R. 903 having an estimated 
cost to taxpayers of nearly $2 billion, 
or $8 billion if you use TSA’s own esti-
mates, it is critical that the bill does 
not simply become an astronomical un-
funded mandate. 
This amendment will remove this 
bill’s requirement to move TSA to title 
5 if sufficient funding is not appro-
priated specifically for those require-
ments. This will protect other critical 
homeland security missions, like cy-
bersecurity and border security, from 
being raided to pay for this legislation. 
In TSA’s feedback on H.R. 903, they 
explicitly stated this: Implementation 
of H.R. 903 ‘‘without additional, ade-
quate appropriations would have dire 
impacts upon the TSA mission and 
negatively impact national and eco-
nomic security.’’ 
Let me read that again. It said that 
without 
proper 
appropriations, 
it 
would have a dire impact ‘‘upon the 
TSA mission and negatively impact na-
tional and economic security.’’ That is 
from TSA itself. 
Those are the words of the agency 
that we are looking at changing, and 
they are warning us. They are warning 
Congress that if we do this, and then 
we don’t follow through with the fund-
ing, we are putting the traveling public 
at risk. If this is not clear enough, I 
don’t know what is. 
I urge all Members to support this 
fiscally responsible amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
As was the case where my colleague 
offered this same idea during our com-
mittee markup, this amendment at-
tempts to bring implementation of 
H.R. 903 to an abrupt halt if Congress 
fails to enact a Department of Home-
land Security appropriations bill be-
fore the end of the fiscal year. 
Plainly 
stated, 
this 
amendment 
would put in place an unrealistic condi-
tion for implementation of this act 
that funds be appropriated to carry out 
this act by the end of the fiscal year or 
else Transportation Security officers 
lose their rights. 
Republicans already forced TSOs to 
work without pay for weeks on end

May 12, 2022 
when they shut down the government a 
few years ago. Under this amendment, 
if Republicans shut down the govern-
ment again, TSOs would not just strug-
gle to put food on the table; they would 
lose basic workplace rights, too. This is 
nothing more than a poison pill. 
Congress should, as we all know, pass 
funding bills on time, but we have not 
passed full annual appropriations be-
fore the start of the fiscal year in 14 
years. That is on us. It shouldn’t be on 
TSO officers. 
It is preposterous that finalizing fis-
cal year 2023 appropriations even 1 or 2 
days late could cause workers to lose 
their collective bargaining rights, ac-
cess to the Merit System Protection 
Board, and other protections. 
Considering that we have bipartisan 
support for this bill in the House, in-
cluding from 14 of my Republican col-
leagues, I am hopeful that after we 
enact this bill into law, we can work 
together to secure the necessary fund-
ing to fully implement it. If we encoun-
ter delays, we can work together to re-
adjust timelines. We don’t just throw 
in the towel on delivering fair and ap-
propriate compensation benefits and 
protections to the TSA workforce, as 
this amendment would require. 
The beleaguered frontline screener 
workforce should not be punished be-
cause Congress cannot do its job in a 
timely way. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
more speakers so I am prepared to 
close when the majority is prepared. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. In closing, I refer 
back to the words of TSA. These are 
not my words. These are not the words 
of the Republican caucus. These are 
the words of TSA, which was tasked 
with a critical mission, and the words 
of TSA are words that we should take 
into account when we are debating this 
amendment and debating this bill. 
The words of TSA: Implementation of 
H.R. 903 ‘‘without additional, adequate 
appropriations would have dire impacts 
upon the TSA mission and negatively 
impact national and economic secu-
rity.’’ 
This amendment is simple. If we are 
not going to fund this, we cannot put 
our national and economic security at 
risk, and this should be sunsetted. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment rep-
resents a new frontier in legislative 
dysfunction. It hinges the rights of 
TSOs on Congress’ ability to pass a 
completely different bill. 
This is not serious legislating. It is a 
bad faith gimmick and unworthy of 
support. There is no justification for 
making the rights of the TSA work-
force contingent on the broken annual 
appropriations process. 
This amendment sends the message 
to the TSA workforce that their funda-
mental rights have an expiration date. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject this amendment, just as my col-
leagues and I did when it was brought 
up in the committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

CALLING FOR JUSTICE THOMAS’ 
RECUSAL 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address a serious problem on 
the U.S. Supreme Court. Justice Clar-
ence Thomas refuses to recuse himself 
from cases where he has a clear con-
flict of interest. 
Thomas’ wife, Ginni Thomas, is a 
conservative, rightwing, zealot activ-
ist, and she is reported to have worked 
to stop the legitimate election of 
President Joe Biden. Now, Justice 
Thomas will rule on cases that protect 
our elections and strengthen our de-
mocracy, the same democracy that his 
wife wants to overthrow. 
Unfortunately, the Constitution was 
not written for such conflicts of inter-
est. It was written by men who never 
imagined the Justices would put per-
sonal interests over the interests of our 
Nation. 
So, I ask Justice Thomas to make 
the patriotic decision to recuse himself 
from cases involving the January 6 
criminal insurrection, the 2020 elec-
tion, and topics that conflict with his 
wife’s far-right personal work. Every 
day he refuses lowers the credibility of 
the Court for more and more Ameri-
cans.

RECOGNIZING THE SAVANNAH 
PAPER MILL 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
Savannah Paper Mill as it celebrates 
its 85th year in operation. 
My father worked at this paper mill. 
In fact, I worked at this paper mill, 
originally known as Union Bag, then 
Union Camp, then International Paper, 
and now International Paper, and I 
have the utmost respect for anyone in 
that line of work. 
At the height of the 1950s, the Savan-
nah Paper Mill employed up to 5,000 
people. As the years have passed, the 
same location, now owned by Inter-
national Paper, has modernized and 
trimmed the workforce down to about 
650 employees. Some of them come 
from a generation of paper mill work-
ers that have been there from the 
start. 
The Savannah Paper Mill has always 
been a visual landmark in the city, 
long before the hospitality industry be-
came the city’s number one market. In 
the 1950s, the mill could produce 1.25 
million 
tons 
of 
kraft 
paper 
and 
linerboard in any given year and quick-
ly became one of the largest mills in 
the State. 
Its proximity to fruitful timber pro-
duced optimal conditions for the mill 
to operate at its highest level, and it 
remains true today. 
Like the rest of Savannah, the paper 
mill contributed greatly to the war ef-
fort in World War II as well, producing 
paper packaging, a critical war mate-
rial. 
I am proud to be the son of a paper 
mill worker, and I thank the Savannah 
Paper Mill for their many years of in-
dustry and hope for continued success.

RECOGNIZING RED DOOR 
CATERING 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one 
of my constituents, Reign Free, found-
er and CEO of Red Door Catering in 
Oakland. 
Reign founded Red Door in 2006 as a 
socially conscious company, aiming to 
bring communities together over deli-
cious food with a special clientele fo-
cused on minority-owned businesses 
and youth development-focused organi-
zations. 
It is worth noting that Red Door also 
has an annual grant budget of $10,000 to 
help nonprofit clients defray some of 
their catering costs. 
In recent years, Red Door has become 
a fixture in my East Bay community, 
having catered events for former Presi-
dent Barack Obama and Vice President 
KAMALA HARRIS at their commercial 
kitchen in West Oakland. 
In line with her commitment to ad-
vancing equity, Reign provides oppor-
tunities for other Black entrepreneurs 
via the Black Culinary Collective, 
through which Red Door shares a 5,000- 
square foot culinary space in West 
Oakland with 10 other Black food en-
trepreneurs. 
Furthermore, as the pandemic raged 
on, Red Door partnered with several 
local organizations to feed those most 
deeply impacted by COVID–19. Alto-
gether, this effort fed about 80,000 com-
munity members. 
On behalf of California’s 13th Con-
gressional District, I thank Reign for 
working tirelessly to create a closer- 
knit, more equitable community.

CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE LEAK AT THE SU-
PREME COURT 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, the leak 
of Associate Justice Alito’s draft opin-
ion on Dobbs v. Jackson was clearly il-
legal. That is why more than 20 Repub-
lican Members of the House joined me 
in calling on Attorney General Merrick 
Garland and FBI Director Wray to open 
a criminal investigation into a poten-
tial violation of U.S. law. 
Title 18 United States Code Section 
2071 states in part: A person who will-
fully carries away any document filed 
or deposited with any clerk or officer 
of any court shall be fined or impris-
oned or both. 
Anyone trying to criminally under-
mine the division of power in our gov-
ernment should be held accountable to 
the full extent of the law, especially as 
the leak is already proving to be dan-
gerous as Justices are facing harass-
ment outside their homes. 
Our country is built on the funda-
mental respect for law and order. It is 
clear to me and my Republican col-
leagues that the law was clearly vio-
lated.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4901 
May 12, 2022 
HONORING OHIO’S FALLEN POLICE 
OFFICERS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today during the solemn occasion of 
National Police Week to recognize the 
law enforcement officers across our Na-
tion who have lost their lives in the 
line of duty. 
Every day, police officers across our 
Nation put on their badges and go into 
their communities to carry out their 
mission to protect and serve. Trag-
ically, some do not return to their fam-
ilies at the end of the day. 
This year, the names of 619 officers 
have been added to the National Law 
Enforcement 
Officers 
Memorial 
in 
Washington, D.C., including four from 
Ohio. 
They are: Toledo Police Officer Bran-
don Stalker, Cleveland Police Officer 
Shane Bartek, Hamilton County Sher-
iff’s Deputy Donald Gilreath, and Ohio 
Department of Natural Resources Offi-
cer Jason Lagore. 
Their legacies will live on in the 
hearts of all Americans and at the Na-
tional Law Enforcement Officers Me-
morial here in Washington, D.C. We are 
perpetually indebted to them for their 
service, courage, and patriotism. Today 
and always, let us honor their service, 
their memories, and hold their loved 
ones close in our heart and prayers. 
f 
HONORING MONTANA POLICE 
OFFICERS 
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Montana’s police 
force for National Police Week. Mon-
tana law enforcement officers put their 
lives on the line every day to keep our 
communities safe and protect those 
who cannot protect themselves. 
They don’t do it for money. They 
don’t do it for recognition. They do it 
because they feel called to protect 
those around them. 
The absence of law enforcement 
means our communities are less safe, 
enables crime to surge, and thugs will 
roam the streets freely without con-
sequence. 
I stand here tonight to say thank you 
to the Montana police officers for their 
sacrifices and for willingly putting 
their lives on the line to protect our 
neighborhoods. 
Without reservation, I back the blue 
and will continue to do everything I 
can to get them the resources they 
need to do their jobs and keep America 
safe. 
f 
OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE IS A 
THREAT 
TO 
REPRODUCTIVE 
FREEDOM 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, if 
Roe v. Wade is overturned, it would 
pose the greatest threat to reproduc-
tive freedom we have seen in half a 
century. 
But let’s be very clear: although 
many States are passing radical laws 
banning abortion, contraception, and 
criminalizing healthcare, right now 
Roe is still the law of the land, abor-
tion is healthcare, and abortion is still 
legal. 
Abortion is an integral part of repro-
ductive healthcare and should be safe, 
legal, and accessible to all. Right now, 
clinics and funds are able to support 
people in accessing abortion healthcare 
with compassion and care. 
One organization in my district, the 
Delaware 
County 
Women’s 
Center, 
serves more than 1,600 patients annu-
ally. I thank the staff at the Women’s 
Center, especially Lizbeth and Jen, for 
their commitment to accessible repro-
ductive health services. 
If a rightwing extremist court over-
turns Roe, we will not go back. A 
strong majority of Americans are step-
ping up to support the freedom of every 
person, regardless of where they live or 
how much money they have, to make 
their own decisions about their health, 
their bodies, and their futures. 
f 
SUPPORTING POLICE SHOULD BE 
A RED, WHITE, AND BLUE ISSUE 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize National Police 
Week and thank our men and women in 
law enforcement. 
Every day, law enforcement officers 
put on their uniform and go to work to 
protect and serve the citizens. How-
ever, their service does not come with-
out danger. Just this year, 123 officers 
have been shot in the line of duty, 
which is 46 more officers than were 
shot this time in 2020. 
Supporting our police and assuring 
public safety for our citizens should 
not be a red or a blue issue but a red, 
white, and blue issue. 
This 
morning, 
I 
joined 
Leader 
MCCARTHY and Republican Members on 
a Back the Blue bike tour alongside 
about 40 Capitol Police officers after 
which we honored our Nation’s fallen 
police officers. 
One officer along the way did express 
to me that he was honored to serve; 
however, it was difficult as he was 
pointed at by some and called terrible 
names while in uniform. He stated he 
could take it, but he lacked a confident 
tone. 
As the son of a former police officer, 
Madam Speaker, I know the tremen-
dous stresses on our officers and their 
loved ones. We all must back the blue. 
STAMPING OUT CORRUPTION 
(Ms. TITUS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, if you 
are looking for a place to start stamp-
ing out corruption, you need look no 
further than the Old Post Office build-
ing just down the street. 
Yesterday, workers began removing 
Trump’s name from the property, end-
ing an era of corruption. While in of-
fice, the former President was both 
landlord and tenant of this establish-
ment, which raised numerous ethical 
questions. 
After reviewing thousands of pages of 
records, Chairman DEFAZIO and I found 
that the GSA failed to both enforce the 
lease, which forbade involvement from 
any elected official of the U.S. Govern-
ment and failed to conduct oversight 
on possible violations of the Emolu-
ments Clause. 
To 
prevent 
this 
from 
happening 
again, I introduced the Outlease Re-
form in Public Buildings Act to pro-
hibit any President from maintaining a 
GSA outlease and to establish Congres-
sional review of the outleasing pro-
gram. 
I urge my colleagues to get this 
signed, sealed, and delivered to the 
President’s desk, and I hope we don’t 
have to look at that Trump sign any 
longer. 
f 
IN DEFENSE OF OUR MOST 
VULNERABLE 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, last week, a draft ma-
jority opinion from the U.S. Supreme 
Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade 
was leaked. This is troubling and un-
precedented. All Americans should be 
concerned about this betrayal of trust 
in our Nation’s highest court. 
My position on life has always been 
clear. You can’t be a champion for the 
future of this great country if you are 
going to limit its potential. 
For the majority of the last 50 years, 
Democrats have controlled the House, 
the Senate, and the White House. In 
that time, they failed to codify Roe v. 
Wade. Today, we are witnessing calls 
from the extreme left to end the fili-
buster in the Senate and pack the 
courts. 
This radical stance neglects the un-
born and continues to ignore the strug-
gles of hardworking American families 
who are trying to cope with soaring in-
flation, out-of-control food and energy 
prices, and the failed policies of the 
Biden administration. 
Madam Speaker, I will always use my 
voice here in Congress to defend our 
most vulnerable and protect the un-
born.

May 12, 2022 
ACCESS TO SAFE ABORTION CARE 
(Mr. POCAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, the 
leaked Supreme Court document shows 
a complete disregard by the Court ma-
jority for the fundamental right to 
control one’s own body by having ac-
cess to safe abortion care. 
In Wisconsin, the end of Roe v. Wade 
would drag us back to 1849, when our 
State law banning abortion was en-
acted and is still on the books. 
In 1849, in Wisconsin, the first tele-
graph was received, there was a 61⁄2 
cent tax on every vehicle drawn by a 
single horse, and railroad tracks were 
constructed going west for the first 
time outside of Milwaukee. 
My constituents, like the vast major-
ity of Americans, don’t want to go 
back. They want healthcare decisions 
to be made by laws that weren’t passed 
when slavery was legal. They want 
women to have full access to modern 
healthcare, and that means access to 
safe abortion care. 
f 
STANDING FOR THE AMERICAN 
WORKER 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, as the 
conference committee for the America 
COMPETES Act begins to meet, I rise 
today to encourage my colleagues to 
work in an urgent, bipartisan, diligent 
fashion on behalf of the American peo-
ple. This legislation is critical to ad-
dressing our Nation’s inflationary chal-
lenges and supply chain pressures. 
Indiana’s First Congressional Dis-
trict is home to an incredible manufac-
turing, steel, auto, and industrial com-
plex. The America COMPETES Act will 
have a direct impact on their ability to 
compete and succeed in our global 
economy. 
Of 
particular 
consequence, 
when 
there is a chip shortage and they stop 
making cars, it affects the automobile 
industry, the contractors, and the steel 
industry. Tens of thousands of workers 
are impacted within my district. 
I want to make sure that today I 
stand up for the American worker, that 
I stand up for American manufac-
turing, and that I stand up for the na-
tional security issue. Today, I want to 
make sure that we look forward to the 
final product of the America COM-
PETES Act which will invest in Amer-
ican innovation and demonstrate the 
greatness of our Nation. 
f 
PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE 
HEALTHCARE 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I 
rise 
today 
because 
reproductive 
healthcare is a human right, but it is 
under threat. 
For nearly half a century, the funda-
mental right to abortion has been 
upheld by courts. Now, the Supreme 
Court appears poised to roll back this 
precedent and steal away the rights of 
170 million American women to make 
their own healthcare decisions. This 
ruling will create healthcare deserts 
across the country where women will 
not have access to the reproductive 
healthcare they need when they need 
it. We cannot allow this to happen. 
The 
House 
passed 
the 
Women’s 
Health Protection Act, which will cod-
ify the Roe v. Wade decision and pro-
tect abortion access in the United 
States. The Senate must follow our 
lead. We must abolish the filibuster to 
end minority rule and guarantee basic 
rights 
and 
access 
to 
reproductive 
healthcare. We cannot rely on the Su-
preme Court to uphold Roe, and so I 
call on Congress to do so. 
f 
AMERICANS ARE STUNNED 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it is not often that America seems to 
be stunned by an action of this Govern-
ment. They may be disappointed, they 
may disagree, but I can assure you 
they may not be stunned. 
In the leak of the Supreme Court de-
cision, America overall, over 70 per-
cent, are stunned by the idea that 
women no longer are equal in this Na-
tion, they do not have women’s rights, 
human rights, or reproductive rights. 
The tragedy for those of us who are 
lawyers, who understand the Constitu-
tion, is that when settled law has been 
announced, that is your belief. To see 
that that is no longer the standard of 
the highest court in the land, we are 
stunned and, yes, we are frightened. 
Roe v. Wade must be codified, repro-
ductive rights must be protected, and 
the anti-vigilante stalking bill, to stop 
individuals from stalking women who 
are simply seeking healthcare and 
abortion, should be passed by the 
House of Representatives. We must 
stand for human rights and women’s 
rights.

WOMEN’S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JAYAPAL). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the subject of this Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, it has been 
nearly 2 weeks since the world saw the 
Supreme Court’s draft decision to over-
turn Roe v. Wade. 
We all had suspected it was coming. I 
rise today to oppose that decision and 
to oppose what has become the tyranny 
of the Republican minority, a minority 
that has worked for decades to restrict 
the rights of women and minorities. 
The extremist Republican minority has 
worked systematically over the years 
to politicize the Supreme Court by 
packing it with activist ideologues who 
hold views in line with the demands of 
these extremists. 
Now this Republican minority, after 
successfully packing the Court with 
ideologues, they now seek to use this 
decision to return women to a dark 
time, a time when a woman had no 
right to decide for herself, to a time 
when abortions were illegal. 
But let’s be clear from the start. This 
whole argument is not really about 
whether or not there will be abortions 
in this country, for there have always 
been, and there will always be abor-
tions in this country and around the 
world. The only question is: Will those 
abortions be safe and legal? 
In 1973, the year of the decision, I 
marched with many women and fought 
for Roe v. Wade. On the day in 1992 
when the decision in Planned Parent-
hood v. Casey was announced, I an-
nounced that I was running for Con-
gress because I objected to the restric-
tions they were putting on women. I 
wanted equal rights for women and 
more pro-choice legislators fighting for 
women in Washington. So I ran for of-
fice and won. 
Yesterday, I marched with my Demo-
cratic colleagues to the Senate in sup-
port of maintaining Roe v. Wade. 
Madam Speaker, I join the majority 
of women in this country in strongly 
opposing this decision, the injustice, 
this march back to a darker time, and 
I will join them in marching, fighting, 
and legislating until our rights to con-
trol decisions about our lives and our 
bodies are secure because I believe 
there is no democracy if women cannot 
make their own choices about their 
healthcare and their bodies, including 
reproductive healthcare. 
If this draft Supreme Court decision 
takes effect, hundreds of millions of 
people in 26 States would be deprived of 
their right to choose, of their right to 
abortion. People of color, the LGBTQ- 
plus community, young people, people 
with disabilities, low-income Ameri-
cans, 
those 
who 
are 
the 
most 
marginalized will suffer the most. 
If Roe falls, State so-called trigger 
laws, in quotes, already passed in 13 
States, will immediately ban abortion 
in those States entirely.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4903 
May 12, 2022 
Also deeply troubling, this decision 
lays the groundwork for the Court to 
tear down other fundamental rights, 
like the right to use contraception, 
marriage equality, and so many other 
rights. All of this from the Republican 
Party that proclaims itself to be the 
party of smaller government except 
when it comes to making decisions 
over a woman’s life. 
Yesterday 
I 
marched 
again. 
I 
marched to the Senate with my Demo-
cratic colleagues and urged my Senate 
colleagues to pass the Women’s Health 
Protection Act, like we passed here in 
this House earlier. This bill would es-
tablish a statutory right to abortion 
care across our country. 
But as they did earlier this year, the 
Senate came up short because there are 
not enough pro-choice Senators to pro-
tect abortion rights for women. This is 
unacceptable, and every Senator who 
voted against the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act must be held accountable 
by the American people, by their con-
stituents. 
Madam Speaker, yesterday’s vote has 
made one thing clear. The Senate is so 
far out of step with what most Ameri-
cans believe. Eighty percent of Ameri-
cans agree that the decision to have an 
abortion should be left to a woman and 
her doctor compared to just nine per-
cent who agree it should be left to poli-
ticians and the government. 
The Senate should reflect the will of 
the people and protect the right to con-
trol our own bodies, which is why we 
need to fight for a pro-choice Senate, 
to protect our rights. 
We can and we must do everything 
we can to ensure that reproductive 
rights are the law of our land. Our 
lives, the lives of our children, and fu-
ture generations depend on it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield now to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
JAYAPAL), the head of the Progressive 
Caucus. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman MALONEY for her 
tremendous leadership on so many 
issues, including reproductive rights, 
and for holding a hearing earlier in her 
committee on abortion and inviting 
several of us to testify. 
I am very proud to be here as the 
chair of the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus. This is our Special Order hour, 
and I couldn’t be prouder to be dedi-
cating this Special Order hour to this 
critical issue of women’s freedom, be-
cause that is what we are talking 
about is women’s freedom. 
The leaked draft opinion from the 
Supreme Court represents an unprece-
dented, unlawful, and unjust attack on 
our constitutional reproductive rights. 
Reproductive rights groups and Black 
and Brown folks on the front line of 
this fight have been sounding the 
alarm for years that this day would 
come. The leaked draft opinion is a 
culmination of decades of insidious 
work from the extreme right, who have 
rigged the system in their favor. 
I speak to you, Madam Speaker, 
today as one of the one in four women 
in America who have had an abortion. 
For people to understand how I ulti-
mately decided to have an abortion, I 
have to start with the birth of my first 
child, Janak. Janak was born at 261⁄2 
weeks while I was on a 2-year fellow-
ship in India. She weighed only 1 pound 
14 ounces, and upon birth she went 
down to a weight of just 21 ounces. 
Janak was so small, she fit into the 
palm of my hand. She was no bigger 
than a medium-sized squash. For 3 
months, we did not know if Janak 
would live or die. She needed multiple 
blood transfusions, she had to be fed 
drop by drop, and she constantly had 
her heart stop and restart. 
We returned to the United States 
after 3 months, and in those early, in-
tensely difficult years, Janak had hy-
drocephalus, water in her brain. She 
had seizures and she returned repeat-
edly to the emergency room because of 
life-threatening pneumonia. The fact 
that Janak is today a 26-year-old beau-
tiful human being is a true miracle, 
and the greatest gift in my life. 
At the same time that Janak was 
born, I was also fighting to keep my 
legal permanent resident status, mar-
ried to a U.S. citizen and with a U.S. 
citizen child, and yet without the abil-
ity to return with the same status that 
I had. In the end, I was able to return 
to the United States with Janak, pro-
vided that I started from scratch to 
qualify for citizenship. 
As a new mom taking care of a very 
sick baby and recovering from major 
surgery myself, I was struggling. I ex-
perienced severe postpartum depres-
sion and post-traumatic stress disorder 
that was only diagnosed after I con-
templated suicide and realized that I 
needed to seek help. My marriage did 
not survive. We split custody of Janak, 
and I was a part-time single parent. 
Shortly after, I met a wonderful man 
who is my husband today. I knew I was 
not ready to have another child, so I 
religiously took my daily contracep-
tive pill. Despite that, I became preg-
nant. I consulted with my doctors, who 
told me that any future pregnancy 
would likely also be high risk to me 
and to my child, similar to what I had 
gone through with Janak. I very much 
wanted to have more children, but I 
simply 
could 
not 
imagine 
going 
through that again. 
After discussions with my partner, 
who was completely supportive of 
whatever choice I made, I decided to 
have an abortion. Two decades later, I 
think about those moments on the 
table in the doctor’s office, a doctor 
who was kind and compassionate and 
skilled, performing abortions in a 
State that recognizes a person’s con-
stitutional right to make their choices 
about their reproductive care. 
For me, terminating my pregnancy 
was not an easy choice, but it was my 
choice, and it really shouldn’t matter 
if it is a difficult or hard choice. That 
choice, that freedom is what has to be 
preserved for every pregnant person, a 
freedom that cannot be dictated by 
people in the minority pushing their 
extremist agenda on everybody else, 
the Supreme Court included. 
Until 2019, so for 15 years, I never 
spoke publicly or privately about my 
abortion. In fact, I didn’t even tell my 
mother about it. Some of it was be-
cause as an immigrant from a culture 
that deeply values children and in a so-
ciety that still stigmatizes abortion 
here in the United States, I felt a 
shame that I never should have felt. 
Two years ago, I decided to tell my 
story as a Member of Congress because 
I was so deeply concerned about the 
abortion ban legislation that was com-
ing out from States across the country, 
and I became only the second Member 
of Congress to publicly talk about my 
abortion. 
Today, as we are on the cusp of a hor-
rific decision from the Supreme Court 
to criminalize women’s rights and the 
right to an abortion, we all have to 
speak out to tell our truths if we are 
able. I want you to know that there are 
so many different situations that peo-
ple face in making these choices. 
Whether the choice to have an abor-
tion is easy or hard, whether there are 
traumatic situations or not, none of 
this should be the issue. It is simply 
nobody’s business what choices we 
pregnant people make about our own 
bodies. Let me be very clear, I would 
never tell people who don’t choose to 
have an abortion that they should have 
an abortion, nor should they tell me 
that I shouldn’t. This is a constitu-
tionally protected, intensely personal 
choice. 
I did not suffer the economic issues 
that so many poor people suffer. I did 
not suffer from living in a State that 
doesn’t allow pregnant people to make 
these choices, and I was very privileged 
to live in a world post-Roe v. Wade 
where abortion had been established as 
settled law as a constitutional right. 
Today, abortion is still the law of the 
land, and providers remain hard at 
work to give the care that so many 
desperately need and deserve. But it is 
clear that the Supreme Court, a major-
ity on the Supreme Court who were ap-
pointed by two Republican Presidents 
who did not win even the majority of 
the popular vote, that the Supreme 
Court is poised to overturn this funda-
mental right to choose. And the com-
munities that will pay the steepest 
prices are our low-income commu-
nities, our Black and Brown commu-
nities, our LGBTQ communities. 
The Progressive Caucus and our 
members have been at the forefront of 
protecting these rights and ensuring 
that we in the House passed the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act, that we 
work to repeal the Hyde amendment, 
and that we remove the stigma around 
abortion care and reproductive health 
choices. 
This is existentially urgent, and we 
will not allow the Supreme Court or 
the United States Senate, the people 
who voted against the codification of 
Roe v. Wade, to win in this battle. We

will fight to the very end for our free-
doms. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank Rep-
resentative JAYAPAL for her leadership 
of the Progressive Caucus and for her 
strength in sharing her very personal 
and painful story. It has given me more 
strength to fight this battle, and I hope 
it will inspire many, many more as we 
fight for our basic rights. 
Madam Speaker, I yield now to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. JONES), 
a leader in the Progressive Caucus. 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, it is ab-
surd, absurd that in the year 2022 I 
have to speak to defend every human’s 
right to make their own healthcare de-
cisions, but because six far-right Su-
preme Court Justices are set to impose 
their unpopular views on everyone in 
this country, I stand here to urge my 
colleagues to do everything we can to 
protect the right to abortion, including 
expanding the Supreme Court. 
b 1645 
Madam Speaker, I stand here for peo-
ple in my family and folks in my com-
munity who could soon have their 
rights stripped away, people who, if 
they aren’t able to get the abortion 
they need, will be trapped in a cycle of 
poverty, folks who will no longer be 
able to work their job or get the edu-
cation that they fought so hard to get. 
For me, this is personal because it is 
people like my single mother who 
worked multiple jobs just to provide 
for our family, Black and brown folks, 
and the poorest people in our society 
who will suffer most from the extreme 
decision to overturn Roe v. Wade—50 
years of settled precedent out of the 
window because Republicans on the Su-
preme Court want to interfere in peo-
ple’s healthcare decisions. 
Yes, the Senate must follow our lead 
here in the House and pass legislation 
that will secure the right to an abor-
tion, but let’s not fool ourselves into 
thinking that the 6–3 far-right Court, 
which is preparing to overturn a 50- 
year-old Supreme Court precedent, and 
which has spent the last decade dis-
mantling the Voting Rights Act, is all 
of a sudden going to start respecting 
the will of Congress. 
That is why we have to pass the Judi-
ciary Act of 2021 to add four seats to 
the Supreme Court to restore balance 
and finally respect the will of the 
American people, who overwhelmingly 
support Roe v. Wade. 
Madam Speaker, I want to now read 
an abortion story from a resident in 
Westchester County, New York, Lisa 
Hofflich, into the RECORD. 
Lisa writes: ‘‘For almost 30 years, I 
could count on one hand the people 
who knew I had an abortion. One was 
my boyfriend, and two were the nurse 
and the doctor who performed the pro-
cedure. Until now. I am finally sharing 
a story I never thought I would tell, 
one that I have kept personal and pri-
vate because of the fear of judgment 
and stigma I thought I would receive 
from the outside world. 
‘‘I was barely 20 years old and a col-
lege junior dreaming of becoming a tel-
evision journalist. My boyfriend and I 
had been dating for only a few months. 
Like many women, my cycle was irreg-
ular, and so by the time I realized I was 
pregnant, I was 8 weeks along. I was 
terrified that my very strict parents 
would force me to quit school, move 
back home, and have the baby. I 
couldn’t do that. I was a baby myself. 
It took me 2 weeks to save up the $500 
in cash and finally get an appointment 
with a doctor to perform the abortion. 
‘‘I will never forget that day, the fear 
and the guilt I was made to feel. After 
learning that I was 10 weeks pregnant, 
the nurse shook her head and asked, 
‘Why did you wait so long?’ Those 
words pierced me then and still haunt 
me to this day. 
‘‘My heart breaks for all the women 
and girls who still suffer in silence 
from the shame imposed on them. 
‘‘I eventually married that boyfriend, 
and we now have five beautiful chil-
dren. But I know if I had not gone 
through with that abortion, these chil-
dren and the wonderful life my husband 
and I built for ourselves would not 
exist. I made the right choice, and I 
have no regrets. I made the right 
choice because it was my choice to 
make. 
‘‘As our fundamental rights over bod-
ily autonomy come under siege, we 
can’t afford to be silent any longer. I 
am sharing my story to bring abortion 
out of the shadows and into everyday 
dialogue so that we can ensure they re-
main safe, legal, and accessible for 
every person.’’ 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, may I inquire 
how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
OMAR). The gentlewoman has 401⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank Rep-
resentative JONES
for sharing that 
story. It was very moving. 
To others that are watching, if you 
want to share your story, send them to 
us so we can read them into the CON-
GRESSIONAL
RECORD
and share with 
other Americans about the need to 
save a woman’s right to choose. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY), one of the leading voices in 
Congress for women’s rights and con-
sumer rights. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my sister and my colleague, 
Congresswoman MALONEY, for taking 
the lead always on issues to protect 
women’s rights. 
I want to declare right now that 
women are not going back. Women will 
not tolerate being second-class citi-
zens. I will not tolerate that my grand-
daughters will not have the rights that 
women have today. That a funda-
mental, basic threshold right in the 
United States of America, in the 21st 
century, will be snatched away is 
something not only unthinkable but 
something that doesn’t need to happen. 
Let me tell you a story that was told 
to me. I have a dear friend, an adult 
man, who told me about his mother, 
Shirley. When he was 11 years old, his 
mother, Shirley, was told that if she 
was going to carry to term the fetus 
that was in her womb right now, she 
would not survive. 
This tragically was just before Roe v. 
Wade was passed, just a couple of 
months before Roe became the law of 
the land. 
The only place that abortion was 
legal was in New York. This single 
mom had to put the money together to 
finally get herself to New York, and 
she did. She scrounged that money. 
She saved. She borrowed. 
But when she got there, she was told 
at the clinic: Too late. She was too far 
gone in the pregnancy. 
She came home and celebrated the 
Fourth of July with her children. When 
she went to deliver, she died, leaving 
an 11-year-old son and two little girls 
to be orphans. 
I have a button that I have had for a 
long time that I wear that says: Roe 
was not the beginning of women having 
abortions. Roe was the end of women 
dying from abortions. 
Do you think that in this country the 
majority of Americans support the idea 
of allowing women to die? We know 
they don’t. We know that the majority 
of Americans—the vast majority of 
Democrats, three-fourths of Independ-
ents, and, yes, a majority of Repub-
licans—say no, that Roe v. Wade, the 
right to access an abortion, may not— 
should not—be overturned. We have an 
opportunity right now in the United 
States of America, and it is called the 
vote. 
We have what I would consider a 
rogue Supreme Court right now. The 
filibuster was eliminated, the require-
ment for 80 votes, in order to get the 
current Justices of the Supreme Court 
there so that they could do this das-
tardly deed. But if we just go to the 
polls, we can change that, not someday 
in the future but in this next election. 
Hopefully, we can get the Senate to 
do it. But I will tell you that MITCH 
MCCONNELL has already said if they 
were to win the Senate, he wants to 
suspend the filibuster, the 80-vote re-
quirement, and make a prohibition on 
abortion the law of the land, not just 
for the States to decide. 
I will tell you something: This is not 
going to happen. There is a tsunami 
out there of opposition to this. It is not 
just women; it is men and women 
alike. It is about families who don’t 
want to see a 13-year-old girl who has 
been raped be forced to carry that preg-
nancy to term. Are you kidding me? 
I am putting out a warning right now 
and an invitation to all people who 
think that women deserve that right to 
control their own bodies to say: No 
way. Hell no. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding, and I join

my colleagues in thanking her for her 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to speak 
against the cruel and unconstitutional 
leaked Supreme Court decision over-
turning settled law of the land, Roe v. 
Wade. To be clear, controlling deci-
sions about our bodies is a basic human 
right. The government has no right to 
regulate what we can do with our bod-
ies. 
Overturning Roe v. Wade is about 
control. It is about religious suprem-
acy. It is about harming women. It 
would fly in the face of decades of 
precedent and the overwhelming ma-
jority of public opinion if this decision 
is to hold. 
We know this decision will fall hard-
est on the most vulnerable in this 
country: women who have been abused, 
women who are the victims of incest, 
and those who have been raped. But its 
consequences will be even more far- 
reaching than we can imagine. This 
will be a blow to everyone who believes 
in the 14th Amendment, to anyone who 
believes there is a limit to how much 
the government can control the deci-
sions we make in our private lives. 
We will be leaving our children and 
the next generation in a world with 
less freedom than we have enjoyed our-
selves. 
It is shocking to me that all of this is 
being championed by and is coming 
from a party that believes in small 
government, a party that talks about 
freedom, liberty. This is the party now 
that wants to do everything that they 
can to tell women what decisions they 
can make about their reproductive 
rights. 
They want somebody like Senator 
TED CRUZ regulating your uterus. 
They want Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY 
having authority over your body. 
We have to say no. We have to stand 
up, and we have to fight back. 
If you care about women’s rights, you 
should be outraged by this decision. 
If you care about a woman’s right to 
choose, you should be outraged. 
If you care about women having ac-
cess to healthcare, you should be out-
raged by this decision. 
If you care about economic justice, 
you should be outraged by this deci-
sion. 
If you care about our basic freedoms, 
you should be outraged by this deci-
sion. 
It is heartbreaking to hear some of 
the stories shared by my colleagues, to 
hear about some of the stories shared 
by my constituents. But it will be even 
more heartbreaking to hear about the 
stories that will be shared if we do not 
protect a woman’s right to choose. 
I think about many countries that I 
visited where women are locked up, 
serving 20 years in jail for having an 
abortion, where we hear about stories 
of women who die in back alleys be-
cause their families forced them to 
have that baby. 
b 1700 
We hear about the stories where rape 
victims are forced to carry their babies 
to full term. 
This is shocking, and it is shocking 
because those stories are about to be-
come the stories of young women in 
the United States of America, a coun-
try that is supposed to be a symbol of 
freedom, a country that believes and 
exports what it means for women to be 
celebrated as an equal, a country that 
talks about how glorious its Constitu-
tion is in guaranteeing the rights of its 
citizens. 
Now, this is about to become a coun-
try where women are crying out in 
pain because their freedoms are being 
impeded by Republicans, who only say 
they believe in freedom but do not 
want to guarantee freedoms to women 
in this country. 
As an immigrant, I am proud to be an 
American. I am proud to be a woman 
living in this country. I am proud to be 
a mother of four children and to have 
given birth to three of them. I am 
proud to have been given the ability to 
make choices for myself that I might 
not have been allowed in the country 
that I was born in. 
But it pains me today to know that 
those who believe in religious superi-
ority, those who don’t believe in the 
fundamental 
rights 
for 
people 
to 
choose as they please in this country, 
might have the last laugh, and we 
might not be able to do anything about 
it. 
Not only do we have a narrow window 
of enshrining and codifying Roe v. 
Wade into law, but we also have only a 
couple of more months to make sure 
that this body and the Senate are not 
lost to religious extremists and that 
our country will be in their hands as 
they govern us to the gutter. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
glad to be here tonight, and I am so 
proud that the gentlewoman put this 
together for all of us. 
Mr. Speaker, to say that I am deeply 
disappointed is really an understate-
ment. I have to tell you, many people 
in our country think that the word 
‘‘abortion’’ is taboo, shouldn’t be said, 
shouldn’t be uttered. The Republican 
Senate reiterated that this week. But 
worse, it told women that we don’t 
matter. It told women that we don’t 
trust you. It told women that you 
should not have agency over your body. 
I have to tell you, I haven’t spoken 
about my personal abortion ever pub-
licly until this week, and the reason is 
because of all of those reasons, that are 
you shamed wherever you go. Even in 
this day and age, in 2022, women are 
still shamed. We have to stop that. 
One in four women in this country 
has an abortion. It is common and 
something that people do actually 
every day. It is a common health pro-
cedure. 
When I was 19 years old, I was barely 
halfway through college, and I found 
out I was pregnant. I was working two 
jobs, scrubbing floors and tables, to get 
through college. I did not have the 
wherewithal but, more importantly, I 
did not have the emotional ability to 
be supporting a child. 
Not only did I not have the infra-
structure and the financial resources, 
but I didn’t have the wherewithal. I 
recognized that, and it was a good deci-
sion. But it was still a difficult deci-
sion. 
When Republican Senators tell us 
that we shouldn’t have agency over our 
bodies, it just reaffirms this taboo and 
this shame, and I have had enough. All 
done. I will not allow people to shame 
me or anyone else that has had a stand-
ard medical procedure called abortion. 
And I am going to use that word a lot 
more than I have in the past, I will tell 
you that. 
But I have greater concerns. In addi-
tion to having an abortion, having con-
cerns about agency over body, I have 
real concerns for my trans daughter. 
She came down the night that that 
opinion was leaked and said: ‘‘Mom, 
what does this mean?’’ Do you know 
what? I didn’t have a lot of really great 
words for her. 
When these reckless decisions are 
made by reckless people called Repub-
lican Senators and extremists in their 
various religions, they don’t under-
stand that they affect real people. That 
is the reason why I sent personal let-
ters to all the Republican Senators, 
plus Mr. MANCHIN, who is in that boat 
of saying that everything is taboo, and 
we should be shamed, and we shouldn’t 
have agency over our bodies. I let them 
know that we are people. My daughter 
and I are people, and we are all going 
to speak up. 
I just want to say one more thing 
about being people. We need people in 
this body who have the lived experi-
ence and have been fighting this fight 
for a long time. It is really important 
that we all speak up, but it is really 
important that we mobilize as a coun-
try and that all of these leaders in this 
body speak up. 
I have to tell you, I am so disgusted 
that I haven’t slept very well this week 
at all. But here is what I do know: I 
cherish everybody, all of my col-
leagues, my pro-choice colleagues. I 
cherish Chair MALONEY, our Progres-
sive Caucus, all of our Democratic col-
leagues. I am so proud to be here. 
But we cannot let this happen. I 
know I am mobilizing. I know every-
body in this body is mobilizing. But I 
refuse to receive shame, or to be told 
that I should have shame, or that I am 
a bad person because I had a regular 
medical procedure. 
I refuse to allow anyone to tell my 
daughter that she doesn’t have agency 
over her body. 
I thank Chair MALONEY for this op-
portunity tonight. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Chairwoman MALONEY
for 
hosting this really important session.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4906 
May 12, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep 
concern for the more than 2.2 million 
Michiganders who will lose access to 
abortion if this extremist Supreme 
Court overturns Roe v. Wade. 
If this draft ruling holds, Michigan 
will return to a 1931 law that makes it 
a felony to perform or facilitate an 
abortion. We must call laws like this 
what they truly are: violations of 
human rights and bodily autonomy and 
an 
egregious 
attack 
on 
essential 
healthcare providers. 
It must be affirmed in this House 
that abortion providers are essential 
and valued. They provide high-quality, 
compassionate, 
and 
necessary 
healthcare and deliver this care coura-
geously, despite pressures, restrictions, 
political 
interference, 
and 
violent 
threats to their personal safety. 
In March, I was proud to join a group 
of 
my 
incredible 
colleagues—Rep-
resentatives PRAMILA
JAYAPAL; BAR-
BARA LEE, who is going to speak next; 
DIANA
DEGETTE; 
CORI
BUSH; 
and 
NIKEMA
WILLIAMS—to introduce the 
first-ever resolution in Congress hon-
oring abortion providers. 
We recognized Abortion Provider Ap-
preciation Day in the memory of Dr. 
David Gunn, who was tragically mur-
dered outside his abortion clinic in 
Pensacola, Florida, by a white su-
premacist, anti-abortion extremist in 
the first known instance of a murder of 
an abortion provider. Unfortunately, it 
was not the last. 
I thank Representatives JAYAPAL, 
LEE, and BUSH for coming forward and 
sharing their own stories about abor-
tion, and Representative NEWMAN, who 
just did so. Not only have they dem-
onstrated that people make decisions 
to have an abortion for an array of rea-
sons; they have also empowered other 
women of color and people with lived 
experiences to stand by abortion pro-
viders in this critical moment. 
Today, I want to let all abortion pro-
viders know that they are valued. I es-
pecially want to recognize two incred-
ible abortion providers and tireless ad-
vocates in my district, Renee Chelian, 
the founder of Northland Family Plan-
ning, and her daughter, Lara. I salute 
the work these women do in spite of 
anti-abortion 
extremists 
who 
put 
Northland in the headlines locally and 
nationally. 
Beyond its impact on providers, of 
course, this ruling will have dev-
astating consequences for women and 
transgender and nonbinary people and 
their communities all across Michigan 
and this country. 
Simply stated, the government has 
no business interfering in the private 
health decisions pregnant people make 
about their own bodies and lives in 
consultation with their doctors. 
Let us proclaim loudly and proudly: 
Abortion rights are human rights, and 
we must work toward a future where 
access to abortion is liberated from re-
strictions and bans universally. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), 
and I thank her for her leadership on 
this issue. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first, let me thank Chairwoman MALO-
NEY
for her tremendous leadership. 
Also, I just have to thank her for her 
encouragement for myself, Congress-
woman JAYAPAL, and Congresswoman 
BUSH to really step out and talk about 
something that I personally have never 
talked about ever because it was my 
own personal business. 
As my mother told me, that is a deci-
sion that I made between her and my-
self, and now, it looks like that liberty 
could be taken away. 
But even in the day—and this was 
way before Roe v. Wade, I had an abor-
tion. The gentlewoman gave me a 
chance to talk about it, which is some-
thing I would not do because of what I 
just said. It was a private decision. But 
once these draconian laws started pass-
ing in the States, and once these trig-
ger laws were put into place, and once 
I saw what was taking place, I was 
compelled to talk about it because 
once we tell these stories, what I 
learned was that there are so many 
people who have similar stories, men 
and women who came to me. People I 
have known for 30, 40 years came to 
me, whispered to me: I had the same 
experience. I was afraid to talk about 
it. 
What I am finding now is that more 
people are beginning to share their ex-
periences. I tell you one thing: In addi-
tion to the privacy issue, it was about 
stigma. 
I was raised in a Catholic school, in 
the Catholic Church. Of course, this is 
a huge decision anyone has to make. 
Nobody wants to have to go through 
this trauma. But I did, and so many 
others have. 
I thank the gentlewoman for giving 
us a chance because that helped me 
personally. Now, we have come to such 
a time as this to really help others and 
to really highlight why the end of Roe 
could poise us to see the abandonment 
of 50 years of precedent and the first 
time a constitutional right has ever 
been taken away. That is unbelievable. 
It would deny millions of Americans 
access to abortions. 
We need to, however, reassure Ameri-
cans tonight that Roe is still the law of 
the land. Abortion is still legal. But 
the threat of this draft opinion high-
lights 
why 
Congress 
preemptively 
should enshrine Roe into Federal law 
by abolishing the filibuster, yes, and by 
passing the Women’s Health Protection 
Act. This really is about our personal 
liberty and our reproductive freedom. 
Nothing less, quite frankly, can be tol-
erated in a democracy. 
There is a whole generation of people 
who do not know life before Roe. 
Again, going back to the day when I 
was in the 11th grade, I know a life be-
fore Roe. 
My mother, fortunately, had a friend. 
I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, 
and we moved to California. She flew 
me to Texas because once I made that 
decision, her friend knew a clinic in 
Mexico. 
Let me tell you, I was fortunate 
enough to survive the procedure, Chair-
woman MALONEY, but it is not lost on 
me that so many women who look like 
me were dying. Afterward, I thank God 
that I survived because I knew so many 
people haven’t. 
b 1715 
Abortion bans affect everyone, but 
their impacts fall the hardest on people 
of color, people working to make ends 
meet, young people, the LGBTQ com-
munity, people in rural communities, 
people who just don’t have enough 
money to travel to go to another State. 
Study after study has shown that de-
nying people access to abortion has 
devastating and long-lasting implica-
tions for their lives. I reiterate: people 
with money will have access to abor-
tions. We are here tonight because ev-
eryone, no matter where they live or 
how much money they make or their 
background or their race or their gen-
der identity, everyone should be able to 
make their own decisions about their 
bodies, their lives, and their futures. 
Finally, another part of this that is 
just outrageous is the fact that these 
decisions about our own healthcare 
could be criminalized. Can you imagine 
if that would happen? The thought of 
this is chilling. It is chilling. 
Even though it is a terrifying mo-
ment, it is an urgent moment. The pub-
lic supports Roe v. Wade. Now is the 
time to rise up—yes—to galvanize and 
to raise our voices about our constitu-
tional rights that are about to be 
taken away if we don’t do what we 
need to do. 
Also, it is a slippery slope because, as 
I have been saying: If they come for me 
today, they are coming for you tomor-
row. This is the beginning of the ero-
sion of rights, such as voting rights, 
disability rights, LGBTQ rights, you 
just name it. 
That is not going to happen because 
I have a lot of hope in the American 
people. This may be a time when we 
have to regroup and fight harder. That 
is exactly what we are doing. I want to 
applaud all of our organizations out 
there who have been so adamant and so 
vigilant and prepared for this day. 
We couldn’t be here tonight talking 
about what next if it weren’t for them. 
I just have to take a moment to salute 
all of our grassroots groups who have 
been working day and night helping 
people, 
providing 
access, 
raising 
money, doing everything they can do 
to make sure that everyone who de-
cides to have an abortion has access to 
safe and legal abortions. 
I thank the chairwoman for holding 
this Special Order. This is a moment 
that we all have to speak truth, we 
have to tell the truth about what is at 
stake. Also, it gives us a chance to tell 
the truth about who we are. As Mem-
bers of Congress, we are people who 
have been through many of the same

challenges that everyone has been 
through. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for her leadership and courage. 
Mr. Speaker, I inquire how much 
time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
JONES). The gentlewoman has 12 min-
utes remaining. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
during a dark time in our Nation’s his-
tory when the right to an abortion— 
the fundamental right to decide what 
happens to your own body—is under 
threat. Today, I rise to tell the stories 
from patients and providers in my dis-
trict. 
The stories I am about to tell provide 
a glimpse as to what life will be like if 
Roe v. Wade is indeed struck down in 
the final decision of the Supreme 
Court. 
These stories come from my local 
Planned Parenthood Pasadena and San 
Gabriel Valley who offer high quality 
healthcare—from STD testing to con-
traception and abortion care. Since the 
Supreme Court decided to allow State- 
based abortion bans to remain in place, 
it has become such an incredible re-
source, not only for my constituents 
but for those living in other States 
where abortion is not as accessible. 
Just last month, a mother of four and 
her husband drove all the way from 
Houston, Texas, to the Planned Parent-
hood Health Center in Pasadena, Cali-
fornia, in my district because of Texas’ 
draconian vigilante law, S.B. 8, because 
she was unable to get care at home be-
cause she was 7 weeks pregnant. This 
was just 1 week past the State limita-
tion. 
She did not have options in Texas. 
She and her husband knew that an-
other child was not the right choice for 
them. They put all four of their chil-
dren in the car and drove for 20 hours 
to Pasadena. They came to Pasadena 
because after searching everywhere in 
surrounding States, the appointment 
in Pasadena was the soonest one she 
could get. She was not wavering in her 
decision. She was sure she wanted an 
abortion. 
She and her family spent a day and a 
half driving to California, a day in 
California when the procedure was 
done, and then had to spend another 
day and a half driving home. The time, 
the expense, and the time off work to 
have a 3-minute procedure done is an 
undue and egregious burden that peo-
ple are already facing when trying to 
access safe and routine abortion care. 
This mother was in and out of her ap-
pointment within 2 hours from start to 
finish but had to spend over 40 hours of 
time and money to access healthcare 
that should be readily available to any-
one who needs it. 
Another patient from Texas came to 
Planned Parenthood in Pasadena in 
March of this year. She had originally 
been scheduled to go to Oklahoma for a 
medication abortion but felt that she 
needed more time to decide if termi-
nating her pregnancy was the right 
choice for her. 
After taking a few days to think 
about her decision, she lost that ap-
pointment in Oklahoma. She flew to 
California to receive a medication 
abortion at 9 weeks pregnant. She and 
her support person had to incur the 
cost of the flight to Los Angeles and an 
overnight hotel stay, as well as time 
off of work to access abortion medica-
tion. 
These are just two stories out of the 
hundreds of patients that Planned Par-
enthood Pasadena sees every day, but 
it illustrates what we are talking 
about with regard to the right to an 
abortion. We mean real people and real 
women with lives and jobs and families 
whose right to decide what to do with 
their own bodies and their own futures 
have been taken away by politicians 
looking to score political points. It is 
wrong. It is cruel. It is unjust. 
I will not stop fighting to enshrine 
abortion rights into Federal law and 
for passage of my bill, the Women’s 
Health Protection Act, which this body 
passed in September of 2021 by a vote of 
218–211, making it the most supported 
abortion rights bill in the history of 
Congress. 
I will continue to fight for these pa-
tients, to fight for these women, and to 
fight for the hundreds of patients like 
them every single day who deserve 
quality healthcare. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Represent-
ative CHU, the founder and chair of the 
ASPIRE Caucus, for her leadership on 
this issue. She is the author of the 
Women’s Health Protection Act, which 
we supported and passed in this House, 
and which we hope to pass in the Sen-
ate, and we will fight with all of our 
strength to pass eventually. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of 
my colleagues for sharing their stories 
and the stories of their constituents. I 
ask the public to send us their stories 
so we can read them into the RECORD 
as we talk about the need to protect 
the freedom of women to make choices 
about their own healthcare. 
I firmly believe that there is no de-
mocracy if the women in this coun-
try—half the population in this coun-
try—cannot 
make 
basic 
decisions 
about their own bodies, their own 
healthcare, their own choices, includ-
ing reproductive healthcare. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my col-
leagues that have reached out and said 
they wanted to be here tonight, but 
they couldn’t for other reasons. We 
hope to have future speak-outs and fu-
ture Special Orders. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING THE SERVICEMEMBERS 
OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND 
RESERVE COMPONENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
PALAZZO) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and submit 
extraneous materials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
stand here to recognize and honor the 
servicemembers of the National Guard 
and Reserve components. 
Over the last few years, our National 
Guard soldiers have been more in the 
spotlight than ever before. These men 
and women proved true to their motto 
of ‘‘Always Ready, Always There,’’ as 
they face some of our Nation’s tough-
est times. 
We have seen guardsmen from all 
over the country help in ways we never 
thought would be needed or possible: a 
5-month deployment to defend the U.S. 
Capitol; to assist in an attempt to se-
cure the southern border; to aiding our 
healthcare workers in the delivery of 
COVID–19 
vaccinations 
and 
other 
COVID-related assignments. These men 
and women leave behind their loved 
ones and livelihoods to assist all Amer-
icans when we most need it. 
Today is an opportunity for Members 
of the House to thank these brave sol-
diers for the tremendous work and sac-
rifice our Guard and Reserve service-
members have endured since the first 
muster of militia forces to present day. 
There are a lot of issues that divide 
our Nation and Congress, but I know 
for certain that support for our Na-
tional Guard and Reserve continues to 
be bipartisan. I am proud of the work 
we are doing to assist these soldiers, 
their families, and the mission. 
Not all Members have a military 
base, but almost everyone has a Na-
tional Guard Armory and National 
Guardsmen in their district. 
I look forward to hearing from more 
of my colleagues today as we take this 
moment to thank them for their serv-
ice. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Hawaii (Mr. KAHELE), the co-chair 
of the National Guard and Reserve 
Components Caucus. 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, mahalo, 
Congressman PALAZZO for organizing 
this Special Order to celebrate the 
achievements of the National Guard 
across the Nation. I am proud to be co- 
leading the bipartisan National Guard 
and Reserve Caucus with you this year. 
I am here to recognize the Hawaii 
National Guard and highlight its grow-
ing role in our Nation’s competitive-
ness and strategic level of defense pri-
orities. 
In my 21-year career of service to my 
State and Nation, I have seen the Ha-
waii Air National Guard transform 
from a quiet, off-the-radar, C–130, F–15, 
and KC–135 squadrons out in the Pa-
cific to lethal and almost full-time 
composite associate squadrons.

May 12, 2022 
The Hawaii Air National Guard’s 
154th Wing and their flying squadrons 
serve alongside Active Duty counter-
parts flying C–17s and F–22s, as well as 
the KC–135, each and every day. There 
are Active Duty pilots flying with 
Guard pilots, side-by-side, deploying 
overseas. 
An important aspect of my job is to 
listen and hear from our men and 
women in the National Guard. Many of 
my policy proposals are the result of 
hearing directly from our guardsmen. 
For example, members of the Guard 
contacted my office last year to raise 
their concerns about the number of 
days a reservist can serve on Active 
Duty. 
b 1730 
As a result, my colleagues and I au-
thored the ‘‘1095 Rule’’ Amendment 
Act, legislation that increases the 
maximum number of days that reserv-
ists can serve on Active Duty to main-
tain mission readiness. We are pleased 
that this legislation was signed into 
law and took effect last month. This is 
a huge victory for National Guardsmen 
across the Nation and ensures the full 
capability of our most talented Reserve 
component members without affecting 
end-strength limitations. 
Now, I believe we can all agree that 
our success, the success of our National 
Guard, 
is 
directly 
linked 
to 
the 
strength of our leadership. The Hawaii 
National Guard is positioned as a key 
strategic defense priority for our mili-
tary in the Pacific, and for that I per-
sonally thank the adjutant general of 
the Hawaii National Guard, Kenneth 
Hara, for his direction in leading the 
Guard in Hawaii. General Hara has 
been central to our State’s early suc-
cess with the COVID–19 pandemic. He 
and his team have been pivotal to the 
coordinated effort between our States, 
counties, and community organiza-
tions. 
Finally, mahalo nui loa. I am grate-
ful for the airmen and soldiers for 
being the best and most diverse Na-
tional Guard organization in the Na-
tion. The important work that each 
and every one of them does makes our 
country strong. I also thank their fam-
ilies for their sacrifice and enduring 
support of their important work. Their 
commitment and participation to the 
Hawaii National Guard Association and 
National Guard associations through-
out the Nation is vital to its success 
and advocacy in Washington. Mahalo 
nui loa. Onipaa mau loa. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my cochair, Representative KAHELE, 
for his remarks. Also to be noted, the 
Representative is an Air Force veteran, 
and he is also a current Air National 
Guardsman. He has served in multiple 
theaters including Operation Enduring 
Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
So we appreciate his service to the Na-
tion not just as a Representative but 
also as a veteran. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the State of Mississippi (Mr. 
KELLY), who has spent 36 years in the 
Mississippi Army National Guard. He 
currently serves as a major general 
throughout his deployments. He has 
also earned two Bronze Stars, the Com-
bat Action Badge, and the Bronze, Sil-
ver, and Gold de Fleury Medals for his 
service. He also serves on the Armed 
Services Committee where he is a huge 
asset for our Nation. 
Mr. 
KELLY 
of 
Mississippi. 
Mr. 
Speaker, today I am proud and honored 
to recognize the accomplishments and 
sacrifices of our National Guard and 
Reserve component men and women. 
The history of the National Guard 
and Reserve predates the birth of our 
Nation. In Mississippi we have the 
sixth oldest active regiment, the First 
Battalion, 155th Infantry Regiment— 
the Mississippi Rifles. 
For over 250 years, brave Americans 
have answered the call to service to 
protect both our homeland and democ-
racies abroad, and to conduct disaster 
response or support to civilian authori-
ties during a crisis. 
Our reservists and Guard members 
bring a unique skill set to our Armed 
Forces, leveraging their expertise and 
real-world experiences from the civil-
ian workforce to bring an exceptional 
and innovative perspective to our na-
tional defense. 
In addition to deployments overseas, 
Guard and reservists are employed 
across the broad and diverse mission 
set, whether it is responding to civil 
unrest in our Nation’s Capitol, defend-
ing our borders, providing relief from 
hurricanes or other natural disasters, 
as well as responding to the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, the 
Guard did a yeoman’s work in the 
COVID response, and it was much less 
by building testing sites, by giving vac-
cinations, and by helping with all the 
logistics. We would not have gone as 
smoothly without our Guard. 
As of today the Mississippi National 
Guard has forces deployed in support of 
four combatant commands around the 
world. During the pandemic, the Mis-
sissippi National Guard activated ap-
proximately 1,700 servicemembers who 
administered more than 765,000 vac-
cinations, 226,000 tests, and processed 
more than 109,000 lab samples sup-
porting the Mississippi Department of 
Health. 
Our logistics professionals traveled 
more than 665,000 miles throughout our 
State to deliver more than 58 million 
pieces of personal protective equip-
ment 
to 
our 
hospitals, 
long-term 
healthcare facilities, clinics, and test-
ing sites. 
Since the global war on terror, the 
Guard has shifted from a strategic re-
serve force to an operational reserve, 
deploying in support of the same con-
flicts, fulfilling the same mission sets, 
and seeing the same combat against 
our enemies as the active component. 
Within this service has come great 
sacrifice, and I honor the fallen Guard 
heroes who gave their lives in service 
of our country and its ideals in the 
global war on terror in addition to the 
countless other Guard lives lost in 
World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the 
Persian Gulf. 
One of these heroes is Sergeant First 
Class Sean M. Cooley, who I had the 
privilege of serving alongside in the 
155th Brigade Combat Team in Iraq 
who was killed in action in Iraq on 
February 3, 2005. In his memory I intro-
duced and had passed the House resolu-
tion that led to the Congressional Gold 
Star Family Fellowship Program Act 
named for Sergeant First Class Sean 
Cooley and Specialist Christopher Hor-
ton, both of whom were Guardsmen. 
In closing, it has been my life’s honor 
to have served in the Mississippi Na-
tional Guard for the past 36 years. I am 
committed to working with my col-
leagues in Congress and within the De-
partment of Defense to ensure that our 
National 
Guard 
components 
are 
resourced appropriately, maintain a 
high level of readiness, and receive the 
same benefits that they have earned in 
their service of our great Nation. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman KELLY for his remarks 
and his service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN), who is a 
former Texas Army Guard and U.S. 
Army Reserve officer. He has over 
seven major commands and over 25,000 
guardsmen in his great State. I know 
he is a huge supporter of them. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good 
friend 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
PALAZZO) for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
those who have faithfully served and 
are serving in our National Guard 
units. 
Dating back to 1636, the Guard has a 
proud history and has shaped and de-
fended our great Nation. In my home 
State of Texas, 199 years ago, Stephen 
F. Austin formed the Texas Militia, 
now known as the Texas Army Na-
tional Guard, and 100 years later, the 
Texas Air National Guard was estab-
lished. Since their inception, these 
courageous servicemembers have been 
first responders to many natural disas-
ters; many in my own district where 
we routinely seem to have hurricanes. 
They have helped to maintain civil 
order, and they have deployed to the 
southern border to protect our sov-
ereignty. 
But their service doesn’t stop there. 
The Guard augments our Active-Duty 
military offering complete warfighting 
capability at only 30 percent of the 
cost. At a moment’s notice, they re-
spond to the call of our country. 
In southeast Texas, Mr. Speaker, you 
will find the 147th Attack Wing at 
Ellington Field where they fly the MQ– 
9 Reaper and are combat mission-capa-
ble and proven, ready to provide crit-
ical ISR and air-to-ground strike capa-
bility. Additionally, they have re-
sponded to the crisis at the border and 
played a vital role in storm prepara-
tion and recovery. The 147th is a prime

example of the benefit of the National 
Guard, and I have no doubt that this 
wing will continue to succeed and lead 
into the future. 
Speaking of the future, we must cre-
ate a Space National Guard mirroring 
the newest branch of our military. Fo-
cusing on missile warning, space intel, 
electronic warfare, satellite C2, and 
many other capabilities, the collabora-
tion between Active Duty and the 
Space Guard would seamlessly provide 
ops and mission support from above. 
As a former member of the Texas 
Army National Guard, I stand firmly 
behind the guardsmen who are will-
ingly called upon at any moment with 
every capability to do any job, includ-
ing in space, and I offer my heartfelt 
admiration and appreciation. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative BABIN for his service 
not only in the military but also in the 
U.S. House of Representatives. Also I 
thank him for what the Texas National 
Guard is doing to try to secure our bor-
der in Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. CAREY). Representative 
CAREY also is a former Army Guard of-
ficer. He represents 18,000 guardsmen. 
Actually, Ohio has 18,000 guardsmen 
and nine major commands Army and 
Air. So I thank my friend for his serv-
ice and for his participation tonight. 
Mr. CAREY. For nearly 400 years, the 
U.S. National Guard has served as a 
vital 
component 
to 
our 
Nation’s 
warfighting and peacekeeping capabili-
ties. 
Guard members are the stewards of 
the equipment and resources necessary 
to assist in times of need, and they are 
always ready to respond to our Na-
tion’s challenges both at home and 
abroad. 
As a former officer in the Army Na-
tional Guard, I know that the Guard is 
so much more than a weekend a month 
and 2 weeks a year to those who serve. 
It is about service to our Nation and 
always being ready to answer the call. 
It is about neighbors helping neigh-
bors, ready to respond to anything 
from a natural disaster, drug seizure, 
or even a cyberattack. Members of the 
Guard are essential to provide the ca-
pabilities to accomplish State and na-
tional priorities that we have. 
In the Buckeye State, the Ohio Na-
tional Guard is always ready and al-
ways there. Since 9/11 more than 25,000 
Ohio soldiers and airmen have been de-
ployed all over the world. Over the last 
2 years, just as the Guard members 
across the country have done, Ohio Na-
tional Guard members have been life-
savers throughout the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
More than 2,000 Ohio National Guard 
members were deployed to 18 testing 
centers and 62 hospitals across Ohio as 
part of clinical and general support 
teams. They prevented a crisis of care 
by providing patient monitoring, trans-
portation, staffing and administration, 
testing, vaccinations, and even food 
distribution. 
I saw their work firsthand at a drive- 
through testing site in Columbus where 
Guard members collaborated with the 
Ohio State University to ensure that 
more than 1,000 Ohioans per day could 
be tested during the national testing 
shortage. It was an amazing operation 
that could not have worked without 
the expertise and efficiency of our Na-
tional Guard members. 
In conclusion, we cannot thank our 
National Guard members enough for 
what they have done to keep us safe 
and what they will continue to do 
throughout their service. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman CAREY. I know the State 
is very proud of his support of the Ohio 
National Guard and all the military 
services that he has. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from 
Utah 
(Mr. 
OWENS). 
BURGESS 
OWENS represents Utah’s Fourth Con-
gressional District, a State that has 11 
major commands and over 7,500 guards-
men. 
Fortunately, 
Representative 
OWENS serves on the Judiciary Com-
mittee 
and 
the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Secu-
rity, so I know he appreciates our 
guardsmen and servicemembers, and he 
is looking out after the homeland. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor National Guard mem-
bers in Utah and across our Nation. 
Since 1636 members of the National 
Guard have proudly served our commu-
nities and our entire Nation. 
Today and every day, we are incred-
ibly thankful for their commitment to 
serving others and keeping us safe. 
These past 2 years have been especially 
challenging for the airmen and soldiers 
of 
the 
National 
Guard 
who 
have 
stepped up when the Nation called and 
provided much-needed support for our 
communities. 
From Logan to St. George, they have 
provided direct hospital support during 
the height of COVID–19, helped fight 
wildfires across the American West, 
and provided a calm and collected re-
sponse to recent episodes of civil un-
rest. 
They have performed under some of 
the most serious and difficult condi-
tions in recent memory while also bal-
ancing their responsibilities as parents, 
spouses, 
employees, 
and 
even 
businessowners. 
I have had the privilege of meeting 
many of these fine men and women. 
From the officers and NCOs of the 19th 
Special Forces Group to privates as-
signed to the 65th Field Artillery Bri-
gade, I have been impressed by their 
selfless service and commitment to 
duty. Utah is truly blessed to serve as 
the proud home of Camp Williams and 
over 7,000 of these remarkable airmen 
and soldiers. 
These brave men and women are al-
ways ready and always there. 
Utah has a one-of-a-kind spirit of 
service, and the members of our Na-
tional Guard are no exception. Each 
and every day they faithfully live out 
their 
mission 
to 
provide 
military 
forces to assist our State and Federal 
authorities at times of emergency. 
They stand ready to protect Utahns 
and Americans from enemies both for-
eign and domestic and to react quickly 
in the face of natural disasters or 
emergencies. I am grateful to them for 
keeping Utahns and Americans safe. 
b 1745 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
BERGMAN), who is from Michigan’s 
First 
Congressional 
District. 
Rep-
resentative BERGMAN was a lieutenant 
general in the United States Marine 
Corps. Semper Fi. He is also, notably, 
the highest-ranking combat veteran to 
have ever served in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my fellow marine and fellow guards-
man, Mr. PALAZZO, for his dedication 
to being one of the co-chairs of the 
Guard and Reserve Caucus. 
It reminds me of continued service 
that members of the Guard and Re-
serve do every day in communicating 
to the general public the value of what 
it means to have a ready Guard and Re-
serve, but also here in Congress, the 
continuing education for all of our 
Members so that they understand in 
their States the importance of main-
taining a ready Guard and Reserve. 
May is National Military Apprecia-
tion Month. So is June. So is July. So 
is August. So is September. I would 
suggest to you, we should be thankful 
continually for the men and women 
who always are standing by at the 
ready when our country needs them. 
Whether it is a humanitarian assist-
ance mission, a disaster relief mission, 
a border security mission, a mobilized 
go-to-the-fight kind of mission any-
where in the world, our Guard and Re-
serve stand ready. 
But in that readiness comes the re-
quirement to properly fund the Guard 
and Reserve, and in the military, it is 
always a competition for resources. I 
believe the combination of States, be-
cause the Governor of every State is 
the commander in chief of their Guard 
units—Reserve units, different story. 
They are under the command of the 
different services. 
But the readiness and the support 
that is offered by each State and its 
Governor to ensure that their Guard 
units are ready to go, whether they are 
Army Guard, whether they are Air 
Guard, no matter what it is, is essen-
tial to not only the State readiness but 
the overall readiness we need as a 
country in the very complex world in 
which we live. 
A special thanks tonight to the fami-
lies of those guardsmen and reservists 
because those guardsmen and reserv-
ists work a Monday through Friday 
job, let’s say. On Friday night, when a 
lot of their peers leave their jobs and 
go home to go play golf or go fishing or 
whatever, they are packing their kits 
and going to drill weekends or a 2-week 
annual training or whatever it is.

The sacrifice of time that the guards-
men and reservists make at the ex-
pense of their family time is some-
thing, again, we should never, ever 
take lightly and always remember be-
cause it is those young children who 
wonder why Mom and Dad are not 
around on Saturday and Sunday. Then 
they see the picture of them wearing 
the uniform and doing the kind of duty 
that we need in the United States of 
America. We cannot thank the family 
enough. 
Having said that, in thanking the 
family, the commanders of the units 
know very well that good training time 
means that you are busy, you are doing 
good things, and if there is nothing to 
do, secure and go home and spend time 
with your families because it is the 
family that keeps everybody together. 
Speaking of keeping things together, 
employers a lot of times don’t under-
stand the sacrifices that their men and 
women are making on the weekends. 
They just see them as good employees 
Monday through Friday. I thank the 
employers. 
There is a group called the Employer 
Support of the Guard and Reserve. 
They have done a great job across the 
country to ensure that the relations 
between the Guard and Reserve and the 
employers are such that there is no 
misunderstanding of why a person may 
ask for an extra day or 2 to leave for 
extra Guard duty to do a longer drill 
weekend. My thanks to the employers 
as well. 
On a little personal note, when it 
comes to Michigan, in fact, today I met 
with the Adjutant General of the 
Michigan Guard. As a State, Michigan 
has some very unique and productive 
training areas. We are a State with a 
lot of water around us. We have a lot of 
woods. Camp Grayling, in kind of the 
central part of lower Michigan, really 
is an example of what a National Guard 
training base could and should look 
like around the country. 
We 
have 
multinational 
exercises 
every year, Exercise Northern Strike, 
and the Alpena Combat Readiness 
Training Center. We are one of the few 
areas where the fighters have unfet-
tered access to unrestricted training 
areas to do live ordnance. 
We need to have our pilots and our 
aircrews and all our shooters ready to 
go. I am proud to represent that part of 
Michigan that houses Camp Grayling. 
Of course, Selfridge Air National 
Guard Base, down kind of closer toward 
Detroit, it is a base with a future be-
cause it is one of the few bases that is 
not a joint base where you have mili-
tary and civil aviation going together. 
The ability of the Air Guard, of the Air 
Force Reserve, of any of the Reserve 
components that fly to put capabilities 
at Selfridge Air National Guard Base is 
a win-win for not only our defense pos-
ture but, quite honestly, for the State 
of Michigan when it comes to providing 
bang for the buck in the defense dollar. 
I could tell you a lot of stories over 
a long time. In my command, my last 
command, as the commanding general 
of the Marine Corps Reserve, whether 
they are a marine, a sailor, an airman, 
a soldier, a soon-to-be space guardian 
in a Reserve component, Coast Guard, 
the men and women who serve, the 
missions that they are ready to do give 
me confidence in our ability as the 
United States military to not only go 
to the fight but to do the humanitarian 
assistance and disaster relief. We are in 
good hands because of the commitment 
of the men and women who wear the 
uniform. 
My friend, Congressman PALAZZO, 
thank you for leading this. Thank you 
for calling attention to the fact that 
without our Guard and Reserve, we are 
less ready as a country. 
Mr. PALAZZO. General BERGMAN, 
being over the 4th Marine Division 
gives you insight that many people 
don’t understand. Being able to con-
nect the relationships between the ac-
tual serving member, their family, and 
their employer is extremely important. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague 
from the great State of Mississippi (Mr. 
GUEST). 
He 
represents 
Mississippi’s 
Third Congressional District. Michael 
also serves as the vice ranking member 
on the Homeland Security Committee, 
so he definitely takes homeland secu-
rity and national security very seri-
ously. He loves the Guard so much, he 
even hired a retired Adjutant General 
to serve on his staff. Thank you for 
being here. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, the people 
of the great State of Mississippi are 
grateful for the service of the 12,500 Na-
tional Guard servicemembers of our 
State and for the leadership of General 
Durr Boyles. 
Our guardsmen are dedicated to 
keeping Mississippi safe by providing 
response to disasters and by serving 
our Nation on domestic and foreign 
military missions. During floods and 
hurricanes, our guardsmen transport 
and rescue civilians inundated by high 
waters. After the storms, National 
Guard engineers repair infrastructure 
and utilities and provide logistics sup-
port to citizens. 
With 65 readiness centers statewide, 
the Mississippi Army National Guard 
can quickly respond to any number of 
events at a moment’s notice. 
The Mississippi Air National Guard, 
operating from the 186th Air Refueling 
Wing, the 172nd Airlift Wing, and the 
Combat Readiness Training Center, 
provides access to services across the 
globe. 
On behalf of the people of Mississippi, 
I thank every man and woman who 
serves in the Mississippi National 
Guard for their dedicated service to our 
State and our Nation. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Georgia’s Ninth 
District 
(Mr. 
CLYDE). 
Congressman 
CLYDE has served as a U.S. Navy officer 
for over 28 years, with three combat de-
ployments to Kuwait and Iraq. We ap-
preciate him being here to support our 
National Guard and Reserve compo-
nents. 
Mr. CLYDE. Americans are blessed to 
have brave men and women protecting 
our precious freedoms, including the 
more than 400,000 members of the Na-
tional Guard. These servicemembers 
selflessly put their lives on the line in 
defense of our Nation. Today and every 
day, we honor their service and sac-
rifice. 
Guard members serve a unique mis-
sion, safeguarding our country as a 
whole and protecting the individual 
States that make up our Nation, in-
cluding my home State of Georgia. 
From assisting at COVID–19 testing 
sites, to maintaining law and order 
during violent demonstrations, to help-
ing out during extreme weather emer-
gencies, the Georgia guardsmen always 
answer the call to serve. 
This service regularly extends be-
yond the Peach State such as at the 
southern border, where there are over 
100 Georgia National Guard troops as-
sisting Border Patrol agents in han-
dling President Biden’s out-of-control 
border crisis. 
Additionally, Georgia currently has 
combat forces at all six geographic 
combatant 
commands, 
serving 
our 
great State and our Nation around the 
world. 
In fact, members of the Georgia Air 
National Guard’s 165th Airlift Wing 
were deployed to Europe in response to 
Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine. 
Georgians are tremendously thankful 
for their service in this vital mission, 
and we continue to pray for their safe-
ty overseas. 
Our Nation is forever grateful for all 
the past, the current, and the future 
men of the National Guard, and we 
thank you for your duty to our Nation 
and dedication to our freedoms. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas’ Sixth 
Congressional District (Mr. ELLZEY). 
Congressman ELLZEY is a graduate of 
the U.S. Naval Academy and flew 860 
helicopters, F–14 Tomcats, FA–18 Hor-
nets, and Super Hornets, and served 
five combat tours in Afghanistan and 
two in Iraq. 
If I may just note, since you are a 
graduate of the Naval Academy, I actu-
ally happen to serve on the Board of 
Visitors for the Naval Academy. My 
best experience was in 2011 when a lit-
tle team called Southern Miss, the 
Golden Eagles from Hattiesburg, Mis-
sissippi, was able to travel up to An-
napolis and put a beatdown on the 
Naval Academy. It only happened once, 
but once in a lifetime is good for me. 
Mr. ELLZEY. Once is more than 
enough for us, but I am sure that it was 
a well-earned victory. I appreciate hav-
ing my friend, Mr. PALAZZO, give me 
this time today. 
Today, I come before the House of 
Representatives to honor and recognize 
those who have chosen to serve our 
country as members of their National 
Guard and those enlisted in military 
Reserve units. 
The National Guard’s mission began 
on December 13, 1636, when the Massa-
chusetts Bay Colony organized three

militia regiments to defend its people. 
Since that day, they have been con-
tinuing their mission of always ready 
and always there. 
In 1775, during the American Revolu-
tion, they were there. In 1918, during 
World War I, they were there. In 1941, 
during World War II, they were there. 
Of course, on September 11, 2001, they 
were there. They are here today. 
Right now, there are over 6,500 Texas 
National Guard members stationed on 
our southern border. Why are they 
there? To protect us, as always. They 
are there to defend every man, woman, 
and child in this country. 
We should not have to rely on these 
brave men and women to secure our 
border as National Guardsmen, but we 
do, and they do. 
They are there to stop the cartels 
from trafficking drugs that are killing 
our young people by the hundreds of 
thousands—105,000 last year dead from 
fentanyl. They are there to save the 
women and children who are being 
brought into this country for the pur-
poses of the sex trade, modern-day 
slavery. 
For many National Guard members, 
their love for country is a calling to 
protect it, and that attributes to years 
of service, just like Red Oak resident 
and veteran Captain Henry Sterling. 
Henry joined the Oklahoma National 
Guard shortly after graduating high 
school and marrying his wife, Billie. In 
1951, Henry received orders to serve in 
Korea, and he answered the call to be 
there. He is still with us today and is 
still married to Billie after 73 years. 
While Captain Sterling’s story is a 
remarkable one, it is not uncommon. 
We have outstanding men and women 
all over this country who dedicate 
their lives to protecting those who 
can’t. 
History has always taught us that we 
can always count on the National 
Guard and those enlisted in our mili-
tary Reserve units to always be there, 
so thank you. 
Thank you for what you do for this 
country. What you do for this country 
can’t be overstated. It cannot be over-
looked. We would not be here without 
you. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 26 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Oklahoma’s 
First 
Congressional 
District 
(Mr. 
HERN), my good friend. He has five 
major 
commands 
and 
over 
10,000 
guardsmen. 
From his actions and deeds, he is 
truly supportive of not just our Active 
Duty but our Guard and Reserve com-
ponents. Thank you for being here to-
night. 
b 1800 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Mississippi for hosting 
this Special Order tonight. 
The National Guard is a special 
group in every one of our States. They 
are the everyday citizens, your neigh-
bors, your coworkers, and your friends 
who choose to use their free time to 
serve their community and protect 
their fellow Americans. 
The Oklahoma National Guard is an 
exceptional group of men and women 
who have responded to the call of duty 
time and time again. Over the past few 
years, the Oklahoma National Guard 
has shown their dedication to our 
country numerous times from sup-
plying our States with necessities as 
we navigated the pandemic to assisting 
our border agents at the southern bor-
der and even representing Oklahoma in 
Washington, D.C. I am proud of the 
work they have done on behalf of our 
State. 
I can’t mention the Oklahoma Na-
tional Guard without honoring the 
memory of an important constituent of 
mine, 
Technical 
Sergeant 
Marshal 
Roberts, who served in the Oklahoma 
National Guard and was deployed to 
Camp Taji when his team came under 
rocket fire on March 11, 2020. He was 
killed in the attack, making the ulti-
mate sacrifice for his Nation. 
The day Sergeant Roberts’ body land-
ed in Tulsa was a day I will remember 
forever. The Nation had just shut down 
due to the pandemic, but that didn’t 
stop Tulsans from lining the streets at 
the airport by the thousands, a solemn 
show of gratitude and honor for Ser-
geant Roberts, his wife, Kristie, his 
daughter, Paityn, and the entire Rob-
erts family. 
I am glad to have this opportunity to 
share Sergeant Roberts’ story again on 
the floor of the United States House of 
Representatives and join my colleagues 
in honoring and celebrating the incred-
ible National Guardsmen and women 
who serve us across this great country. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, at this 
time I recognize a colleague of mine 
from Virginia’s Sixth District. He has 
seven major commands and over 9,000 
guardsmen. I would like to note he 
serves on the Appropriations Com-
mittee. Ninety-two percent of all fund-
ing that guardsmen receive comes from 
the Federal Government through his 
committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
PALAZZO for hosting this Special Order 
this evening and recognizing the tre-
mendous service and sacrifice of the 
brave men and women of the National 
Guard and the Reserve components of 
our Armed Forces. I also thank the 
gentleman for his service in the Mis-
sissippi Guard. 
It is also certainly fitting to honor 
these often unsung heroes as we cele-
brate Military Appreciation Month. 
While the National Guard was found-
ed in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 
1636, 
the 
Virginia 
National 
Guard 
traces its history and tradition of cit-
izen-soldier service to the founding of 
Jamestown in 1607. There has been a 
military presence defending Virginia 
ever since. 
The Virginia National Guard’s cur-
rent strength is 7,200 soldiers, 1,200 air-
men, 300 Virginia Defense Force mem-
bers, and 400 Federal and State civil-
ians. They bring more than $250 million 
in annual income into the Common-
wealth. 
The Virginia National Guard cur-
rently has more than 2,000 personnel 
serving on Federal Active Duty with 
units 
conducting 
missions 
in 
the 
United States, Middle East, the Horn of 
Africa, and Kosovo, the most since 
2007. The 29th Infantry Division has the 
most divisional soldiers on Federal 
duty since World War II, with units de-
ployed from Virginia, Kentucky, and 
Maryland. 
Currently, 
Virginia 
Air 
National 
Guard pilots and maintainers assigned 
to the 192nd Wing from Joint Base 
Langley-Eustis 
are 
currently 
sup-
porting the 1st Fighter Wing’s deploy-
ment at Al Dhafra Air Base, United 
Arab Emirates, to provide short-notice 
air superiority to U.S. Central Com-
mand amid a series of recent attacks in 
the region. 
Approximately 120 Virginia National 
Guard soldiers assigned to the Staun-
ton-based 116th Infantry Brigade Com-
bat Team Headquarters are on Federal 
Active Duty to take responsibility for 
the NATO-led Kosovo Force Regional 
Command-East, and approximately 140 
soldiers assigned to the Sandston-based 
2nd Battalion, 224th Aviation Regi-
ment, 29th Infantry Division are mobi-
lized to serve as their aviation task 
force. NATO KFOR troops conduct 
peace support operations, contributing 
to a safe and secure environment for 
all the people in Kosovo while healthy 
political dialogue continues between 
Kosovo and Serbia. 
Approximately 300 National Guard 
soldiers assigned to the Norfolk-based 
1st Battalion, 111th Field Artillery 
Regiment, 116th Infantry Brigade Com-
bat Team are on Federal Active Duty 
conducting training to provide per-
sonnel and site protection using the 
Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar Sys-
tem, or C–RAM, in the Central Com-
mand area of operations in the Middle 
East. 
Approximately 
1,000 
Virginia 
and 
Kentucky National Guard soldiers as-
signed to the Lynchburg-based 1st Bat-
talion, 116th Infantry Regiment, 116th 
Infantry Brigade Combat Team are on 
Federal Active Duty as Task Force Red 
Dragon as a security force in support of 
Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Af-
rica. 
Approximately 80 soldiers assigned to 
the Virginia Beach-based 329th Re-
gional Support Group are currently on 
Federal Active Duty in the Central 
Command Area of Operations under the 
operational control of Combined Joint 
Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve 
serving as the base operating support- 
integrator for multiple installations. 
Finally, approximately 500 Virginia

Spartan to provide leadership, com-
mand, control, and in-depth staff anal-
ysis for Operation Spartan Shield. 
As we celebrate Military Apprecia-
tion Month, let us never forget those 
who are serving and who have given 
their last full measure while wearing 
our Nation’s uniform, those who are 
still on the front lines in places both 
known and unknown, and the families 
who are asked to carry the burden 
while their loved ones are away. 
May God continue to bless our troops 
and the United States of America. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman CLINE so much for his re-
marks. 
At this time, I would like to intro-
duce Congressman CARTER from Geor-
gia’s 
First 
Congressional 
District, 
where they host eight major commands 
in his State and over 16,000 patriotic 
guardsmen. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
sponsoring this Special Order tonight. 
It is extremely important and timely 
at that. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure 
today to recognize the Members of the 
United States National Guard that call 
our district home. 
The First Congressional District of 
Georgia is home to every branch of the 
military in America. It is home to 
Moody Air Force Base, Kings Bay 
Naval Base, Hunter Army Airfield, and 
Fort Stewart. All of those are in the 
First Congressional District of Geor-
gia. 
Make no mistake about these great 
installations, they were placed here 
along the 110 miles of pristine coastline 
for a reason. It is because of our great 
weather, and it is because of our prox-
imity to the Port of Savannah and the 
Port of Brunswick. 
In addition to those branches of the 
military and to those military bases, 
we also are home to the Combat Readi-
ness Training Center at the Air Domi-
nance Center in Savannah. 
The Air Dominance Center is home 
to the Air National Guard in Savan-
nah. Unfortunately, the President, in 
his budget for fiscal year 2023, has pro-
posed closing the most efficient, the 
most utilized combat readiness train-
ing center here in America, the one lo-
cated in Savannah, and, oh, by the 
way, the one that is about to complete 
a $24 million hangar built for stealth 
fighters. Unbelievable. 
In fact, they have invited me to the 
ribbon cutting that is to be held in 
September, with the intention now of 
this administration wanting to close it 
down in April of next year. No wonder 
taxpayers get so upset about wasteful 
government spending. This is the most 
ludicrous thing I have ever heard. 
On top of that, think about the world 
stage that we are in right now. Madam 
Speaker, do you realize that we are po-
tentially on the brink of world war III? 
Think about it. Russia has attacked 
Ukraine. An errant missile, a mistake, 
they hit a NATO country, all of a sud-
den it triggers NATO Article 5, and all 
of a sudden we are in world war III. 
And this President and this adminis-
tration are talking about closing a 
combat readiness training center? You 
have got to be kidding me. We ought to 
be opening more. This is the most ludi-
crous thing I have ever heard. 
The 
Savannah 
Combat 
Readiness 
Training Center represents the most 
uniquely cost-efficient taxpayer invest-
ment thanks to the shared airfield be-
tween the National Guard Bureau and 
the 165th Airlift Wing. 
This can’t be allowed to happen. This 
has got to be stopped, and I am pre-
pared to do what it takes to ensure 
that it doesn’t. 
I am here today to say that I appre-
ciate and that I value members of the 
Georgia National Guard and members 
of the United States National Guard 
and that we are going to do everything 
we can to make sure that the Combat 
Readiness Training Center in Savannah 
stays open. 
God bless our country, God bless our 
troops, and God bless the National 
Guard. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman CARTER for those 
wonderful remarks. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
STANSBURY). The gentleman from Mis-
sissippi has 16 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, as a 
former Marine Corps reservist and cur-
rent member of the National Guard, I 
am proud to represent my fellow Mis-
sissippi guardsmen in Congress. 
It is no secret that Mississippi has a 
continued history of support of our 
Armed Forces. The south Mississippi 
community understands what backing 
our military every step of the way 
truly means. 
I am proud to have been able to lead 
the way on a project that directly ben-
efits the guardsmen in Mississippi and 
across America. 
The Mobilization and Annual Train-
ing Equipment Site, MATES, located 
at Camp Shelby, would update the cur-
rent MATES facility that was built in 
1984 and was designed to handle smaller 
models of armored vehicles. This new 
facility would construct 52,000-square 
feet of maintenance training bays and 
supporting facilities that are currently 
being utilized to maintain the equip-
ment that supports the readiness of 
two heavy brigade teams. 
As a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, I am happy to have been 
able to assist our guardsmen in secur-
ing funding for this project in the fiscal 
year 2022 omnibus bill. 
The MATES facility at Camp Shelby 
is a crucial asset to south Mississippi 
and our national defense. These funds 
will make the work of our National 
Guard at Camp Shelby safer and more 
efficient as well as boost the sur-
rounding economy. 
The National Guard and Reserve Cau-
cus is committed to pursuing legisla-
tive and policy initiatives that ensure 
the National Guard and Reserve com-
ponents have strong representation on 
policy, procurement, force structure, 
and utilization within the Department 
of Defense. 
This caucus is one of the largest and 
most bipartisan caucuses in the House. 
As co-chair of this caucus, I am excited 
to highlight a few of the caucus’ legis-
lative priorities and recent policy wins 
for our guardsmen. 
H.R. 3626, the National Guard and Re-
serve Incentive Pay Parity Act was in-
cluded in the final version of the NDAA 
and was signed into law on December 
27, 2021. This legislation would require 
the military to provide Reserve and 
National Guard servicemembers incen-
tive and special duty pay at the same 
rate as their Active Duty counterparts. 
I am also thankful for previous Co- 
Chair TIM RYAN’s leadership on this 
bill that will ensure guardsmen are re-
ceiving pay parity. 
Additionally, I was proud to see cur-
rent Co-Chair KAI KAHELE’s 1095 Rule 
Amendment Act included in the most 
recent NDAA that recently went into 
effect. This law will strengthen the Na-
tional Guard and Reserve by increasing 
the maximum days reservists can serve 
on Active Duty. I thank Congressman 
KAHELE for his steadfast work on this 
victory 
that 
directly 
benefits 
all 
guardsmen. 
Going forward, the caucus will con-
tinue to push on legislative priorities 
that will benefit our guardsmen and re-
servists. I encourage all of my col-
leagues to join the caucus and receive 
monthly updates on legislation that 
benefits the National Guard and Re-
serve components and also share with 
the caucus success stories of their own 
National Guard. 
Madam Speaker, I am about to close, 
but I have one more gentleman I would 
like to yield time to. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER). 
A TRIBUTE TO MICKEY GILLEY 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of 
country music legend, Mickey Gilley. 
Mickey Gilley passed away Saturday, 
May 7, in Branson at the age of 86. 
Born on March 9, 1936, Mickey was a 
native of Natchez, Mississippi, where 
he grew up around his two famous 
cousins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Jimmy 
Swaggart. 
In his career, Mickey earned 39 top 10 
hits and 17 number-one songs, with six 
Academy of Country Music Awards, a 
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, 
and was a member of the 2011 Texas 
Country Music Hall of Fame. Gilley 
was also one of few artists to have re-
ceived the Academy of Country Music’s 
Triple Crown Award. 
But it was the opening of a country 
dance club bearing his name that 
changed the world of country music

forever. It was 1971 when Mickey Gilley 
officially opened the doors of his fa-
mous honky-tonk, Gilley’s. 
Gilley’s reputation grew so much 
that Hollywood even took notice with 
the hit movie, ‘‘Urban Cowboy’’—some 
of y’all have probably seen it—where 
he even made an appearance alongside 
John Travolta, Debra Winger, and 
Johnny Lee. 
Inspired by the real-life romance of a 
pair of the club’s patrons, ‘‘Urban Cow-
boy’’ put Gilley’s on the map, revived 
music careers, launched other careers, 
introduced two-stepping to a whole 
new audience, and created a lifestyle 
that has been adopted by millions. 
b 1815 
Following his role in ‘‘Urban Cow-
boy,’’ Mickey Gilley found himself per-
forming in the main showrooms in 
places like Las Vegas, Reno, Tahoe, At-
lantic City, and even traveling to Eu-
rope to perform. Gilley even performed 
for Presidents Ronald Reagan and 
George H.W. Bush. Over the decades, 
Gilley appeared in a number of popular 
television series, including ‘‘The Fall 
Guy,’’ ‘‘Fantasy Island,’’ ‘‘Dukes of 
Hazzard,’’ ‘‘Murder, She Wrote,’’ and 
‘‘CHiPS.’’ 
Not only will Mickey Gilley’s music 
live on in the hearts of so many who 
loved his music, but his cultural influ-
ence cannot be understated. ‘‘Urban 
Cowboy’’ became an American phe-
nomenon, and it was influenced by the 
real-life stories of Gilley’s patrons Dew 
Westbrook and Betty Helmer. ‘‘Urban 
Cowboy’’ told the story of a west Texas 
farmhand new to the area and working 
his job at a refinery. 
This film introduced country-western 
dance to America and created a life-
style adopted by millions. Even more 
surprisingly, it directly resulted in the 
most unlikely outcome of all, country- 
western music becoming mainstream. 
Once considered outdated hillbilly at-
tire, cowboy hats and belt buckles were 
back in, and they became high fashion. 
Recently, 
on 
Saturday, 
July 
29, 
Mickey Gilley came to the Galveston 
Regional Chamber of Commerce’s cele-
bration: ‘‘The 50th Anniversary of 
Gilley’s and the 42nd Anniversary of 
Urban Cowboy.’’ It was a great celebra-
tion with thousands, and Mickey sang 
for us, delighting the crowd. We even 
presented him with a copy of a tribute 
I did to him on the floor of the U.S. 
House of Representatives and a plaque 
commemorating the event. 
Mickey Gilley will be missed, but his 
legacy will live on not only in the 
hearts and minds of those who loved 
his music, but also in America’s love 
for country music. Wrangler jeans, 
cowboy boots, and pickup trucks will 
all be remembered because of him. 
Mickey Gilley has even been featured 
in the popular ‘‘Texas Hot Country 
Magazine.’’ 
Gilley was preceded in death by his 
wife, Vivian, who passed in 2019. He is 
survived by his wife, Cindy Loeb 
Gilley; his children, Kathy, Michael, 
Gregory, and Keith Ray; four grand-
children; nine great-grandchildren; and 
his cousins Jerry Lee Lewis and Jimmy 
Swaggart. 
Thank you, Mickey Gilley, for intro-
ducing our way of life to the world. 
You will forever be a legend. 
MOURNING THE LOSS OF KEN CLARK 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I have one more notable who has 
passed in our great district, so will also 
commemorate him. 
I rise today to mourn the loss of our 
great Galveston County Precinct 4 
Commissioner, Ken Clark. He was Gal-
veston County’s longest-serving elected 
official. Ken had become a commis-
sioner in 1998, and he has been an ac-
tive member of our community for 
even longer. 
Ken has been an instrumental com-
munity leader for several decades and a 
dedicated public servant. In his time, 
he has served on the State Republican 
Executive Committee, he has served as 
Sergeant at Arms of the Republican 
Party of Texas, he has served as Gal-
veston’s 
Municipal 
Utility 
District 
president, and received the Republican 
Party’s Volunteer of the Year award. 
Ken also worked extensively with a 
wide variety of community organiza-
tions and tirelessly worked to improve 
the lives of those who lived in Gal-
veston County. 
I first met Ken when he worked on 
former Congressman Steve Stockman’s 
campaign. Ken was a go-getter, a great 
conservative, and a great Republican 
back then and even more so now. Ken 
was a devoted public servant, a hus-
band, a father, and a mentor. He loved 
Jesus Christ, and it showed. 
Commissioner Clark, you will be 
sorely missed, but we will see you 
again. In the meantime, our thoughts 
and prayers are with you and your 
wonderful wife, Sherry, and y’all’s 
seven children. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his remarks. I 
thank you, Madam Speaker, for allow-
ing me to host this Special Order 
today. It was great to hear from each 
of my colleagues on the importance of 
our Guardsmen and Reservists. I thank 
all who participated, and I look for-
ward to working together on the issues 
that lie ahead. 
Finally, I thank all our National 
Guardsmen, our Reservists, and their 
families. The work you are doing is 
making America better, you are mak-
ing America safer, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
f 
ABORTION IS NOT HEALTHCARE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLY) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, tonight we are going to be 
taking some time to talk about life. I 
know today on the floor of the people’s 
House we observed the one millionth 
death from COVID. 
When I came to work today, I saw 
that the flags were at half-mast, and I 
didn’t know why they were at half- 
mast, and then I found out why. It was 
because we were observing the loss of 
life during the time of COVID–19. Loss 
of life is always a critical issue in the 
people’s House and in the United 
States of America. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER), my good friend from the 12th 
Congressional District and the young 
man who I stood with today as we did 
take that moment to observe the one 
millionth death. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLY) for allowing me to 
speak on such an important issue. As 
my colleague mentioned, my friend, 
any loss of life is tragic. What is even 
more tragic is the loss of life that 
could have been prevented. 
I want to make sure that there is no 
doubt where I stand when it comes to 
defending human life, especially the 
life of the unborn. That is why every 
day I wear this pin on my collar that 
represents the size of a baby’s feet at 10 
weeks after conception, a baby that 
has a heartbeat, a baby that is alive. 
I have two children and three grand-
daughters, and after holding each one 
of them in my arms for the very first 
time after they were born, I know what 
we all know, that before they were 
born, they were children. They are 
human life, and they deserve the oppor-
tunity for that inalienable right of life. 
When two healthy individuals go to 
the doctor for a procedure and only one 
life comes out of that procedure, that 
is not healthcare. In fact, it is the 
exact opposite of healthcare. 
We hear a lot of people talking about 
reproductive rights, and I am all about 
people being able to exercise all of 
their rights, but when an individual ex-
ercises their reproductive rights, the 
baby, the child, deserves to be born. 
The left has said many times that 
overturning Roe v. Wade is radical. 
Well, from what we have heard about 
the decision, it simply puts it back 
into the legislatures of the States. 
Overturning Roe v. Wade is not radical. 
What is radical is allowing abortions 
up until the day of a baby’s birth. That 
is radical. One thing that I want to be 
remembered for when the good Lord 
calls me home is the fact that during 
my lifetime, if nothing else, I will be 
remembered that I fought for life. I 
fought to defend those babies before 
they were born. 
The chart that we see over here says 
that there have been 327,649 abortions 
so far this year. That is almost 2,500— 
it is 2,482 abortions per day in the 
United States of America. I call that a 
pandemic. And that is one that is pre-
ventable. 
I think we should be doing every-
thing we can in the people’s House to 
make sure all the babies in the United 
States of America have that constitu-
tional right, that inalienable right to

life. I thank the gentleman for yielding 
to me. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend from Penn-
sylvania. I think today as we look at 
this, and I know it has become such a 
horrible thing to even talk about, so 
when we enter this floor, the people’s 
floor, the people’s House, and we are 
not willing to talk about an issue like 
this and do it civilly, but it erupts in 
some type of anger that just, quite 
frankly, is not understandable. 
Madam Speaker, I am sure many of 
the folks watching at home know the 
Supreme Court is in the midst of one of 
the most important cases in American 
history, but many folks might not 
fully understand the issue before the 
Court. So I wanted to take a moment 
to lay out the facts. 
In 2018, the State of Mississippi 
passed a law protecting life after 15 
weeks in the womb. After this law was 
passed, the Jackson Women’s Health 
Organization, the last remaining abor-
tion place in the State of Mississippi, 
filed suit against the State, alleging 
the 15-week protection was unconstitu-
tional. 
The Jackson Women’s Health Organi-
zation believed there is a constitu-
tional right to an abortion, a right 
legal experts have said for years that 
doesn’t really exist. But despite this, 
the Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion has persisted in arguing their 
case. So after years of trials and mul-
tiple rounds in the Federal courts, the 
Supreme Court decided to step in and 
settle the question once and for all, 
which brings us to today. 
Now, the question before the Court 
fundamentally is whether there exists 
a constitutional right to an abortion. 
We believe the answer is clear, and Jus-
tice Alito and his colleagues appear to 
agree. 
The Declaration of Independence af-
firmed our right to life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. Nowhere in 
the Constitution is there a right to 
abortion. I know there are times in our 
lives that it is inconvenient for the 
birth of a child, but the right to life is 
fundamental. 
One last thing I think is worth not-
ing about this Supreme Court: The case 
was brought by the Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization, which is the last 
abortion 
clinic 
remaining 
in 
Mis-
sissippi. The organization, which has 
devoted itself to aborting lives, unborn 
lives, chooses to call itself a women’s 
health organization despite the fact 
that more than half of all the lives 
they end each day are female. Little 
boys and little girls are aborted each 
day within those walls, yet abortion-
ists who work there continue to fight 
for their right to abort. 
That is a point we must never forget. 
Abortion is not healthcare. It is the 
only medical procedure, as my friend 
Mr. KELLER just pointed out, where at 
least one of the patients always dies. 
Ultimately, the leak at the Supreme 
Court was unacceptable, and we need 
to get to the bottom of it, but we 
shouldn’t let that leak distract us from 
the real issue here. That is the victory, 
the possible victory for the unborn. 
The truth is, we don’t really know 
how many babies die each year from 
abortion, but the best estimates are 
that 906,000 babies will die in the 
United States this year alone. That is 
nearly two babies per minute. 
We are engaged in this great observa-
tion of what is taking place in Ukraine, 
and we talk every day about the loss of 
lives, and we talk about how could the 
Russians be so cruel to bomb a hospital 
where there are expectant mothers and 
end the life not only of the expectant 
mother but also of the unborn child. 
But that is what we worry about. So we 
turn our eyes to Ukraine, and we shade 
our eyes from what is happening in the 
United States of America. Because if 
we don’t see it, we don’t have to admit 
that it is happening. 
Look, about 870,000 babies are esti-
mated to have been aborted last year, 
and that number keeps getting higher 
and higher, but this statistic doesn’t 
capture the true numbers. Some States 
don’t report accurate information or 
require abortionists to collect data. 
The CDC doesn’t properly catalog this 
information, either. 
b 1830 
Chemical 
abortions 
further 
com-
plicate the picture because these are 
drugs that can be taken at home with 
no doctor’s oversight and no data re-
porting at all. 
Totally unrecognized, totally un-
counted, totally ignored. All of this re-
sults in an incomplete patchwork of 
abortion data that hides the true num-
ber of deaths. 
Contrary to the claims of the abor-
tion industry, chemical abortion drugs 
are not safer or easier for expecting 
mothers. 
Women 
experience 
severe 
pains, heavy and prolonged bleeding, 
vomiting, and infections that can be-
come as severe as sepsis. These com-
plications can be deadly for expecting 
mothers. 
One study found that one-fifth of all 
chemical abortions results in complica-
tions. It also found that chemical abor-
tions are even more deadly than reg-
ular abortions. So chemical abortions 
are not safe, they are not safer. Yet, 
the abortion industry keeps promoting 
them to women as an easier alternative 
to eliminate the life of an unborn baby. 
Isn’t it great to put it as an ‘‘easier al-
ternative’’? 
Now, despite this evidence, in Decem-
ber 2021, the Biden administration an-
nounced it was removing the require-
ment that the chemical abortion drug, 
mifepristone, be dispensed to a preg-
nant woman by a healthcare provider. 
Look, this change does possess a seri-
ous threat to women across America 
and has serious implications for the 
unborn. So many on this side have al-
ways been champions of life, all life, 
from its conception to its natural end. 
I have a piece of legislation called 
the Heartbeat Act, which was intro-
duced by former Representative, STEVE 
KING. And this is a very simple bill. No 
abortion can be performed if a heart-
beat is detected, except in cases where 
a mother’s life is directly in danger. 
And I hear people tell me, Listen, 
you shouldn’t be using that as an indi-
cator. Yet, any time I have ever gone 
in for my medical procedure, either the 
doctor or whomever is there helping 
them, the first thing they do is grab 
my wrist and try to see if my heart is 
beating through the number of pulses, 
or they put a stethoscope on. And I am 
assuming they are trying to find out, is 
this guy still alive. The way they do it 
is by listening to my heart through a 
medical device. 
We worry so much about life. We 
worry so much about protecting life. 
We worry so much about this horrible 
type of activity that is taking place all 
over our globe, and we are more con-
cerned about what the Russians are 
doing in Ukraine than what we are 
doing right here in the United States of 
America. The numbers pale in compari-
son to what we are doing. 
Now, we can continue to ignore this, 
and we can continue to argue over this, 
but we can’t defy the one basic fact: 
That we are eliminating a life. It is 
undebatable. 
Now, I think as Republicans, we al-
ways believe in the sanctity of life. 
And I will guarantee you there are peo-
ple on the other side of the aisle, many 
of them feel the same way, they are 
just limited on that which they can 
speak. And it goes back to the old 
adage, There are no secrets in our 
house. There are just a lot of things we 
don’t talk about. 
Now, we can never compromise on 
this. I tell people all the time, Look, I 
know there are times in your life where 
this is an inconvenient pregnancy, and 
that the birth of this child could be an 
inconvenient burden on the family. 
That is why we have the adoption op-
tion. That is why we have foster care. 
We have thousands upon thousands 
upon thousands of loving families that 
would love to take in this new, little 
baby girl or this new, little baby boy; 
it isn’t that there is not a home for 
them. And while it may be inconven-
ient at the time, there is nothing more 
precious than life. 
Mr. KELLER referred to this board 
that we brought in that said: Abortions 
as of May 12, 2022, 327,649. 
Now, we went a little step further. 
We are talking about deaths by deci-
sion. Since we started this talk, 17 
more lives have been ended. So the 
327,649 more accurately should read 
327,666. 
Madam Speaker, I would ask all of 
our colleagues to stop and think about 
what we have done. Some of us fight 
for life and others of us fight for an-
other issue. I’m not sure I ever under-
stood it, because usually where it ends 
up is a screaming match as opposed to 
a debate in saying, What in the world 
are you thinking? Why do we allow the 
slaughter of these innocents?

Now, I know people don’t like it be-
cause they say, I don’t like you de-
scribing me as that and I don’t like 
being accused of that, and so what I 
would rather do is not talk about it at 
all. 
Madam Speaker, I had the honor 
when I first got elected to Congress to 
have lunch with Justice Scalia. We 
talked about the life issue. Justice 
Scalia looked at me and said, You 
know what, Mr. KELLY, I find it abomi-
nable that 50 States who have the re-
sponsibility and the jurisdiction choose 
to give the issue to nine former law-
yers to make a decision for them. 
On this issue, we should never, ever 
cower away from it. We should never, 
ever deny that it is happening. We 
should never, ever say that my per-
sonal preference is for life. But the Su-
preme Court deemed that it was their 
responsibility. 
The real test will take place if the 
decision goes back to the States and 
the States and their elected officials 
make the decision. At that point, I 
would expect those who say, Well, my 
personal preference would be to stand 
up and defend life because the Supreme 
Court is no longer your barrier, no 
longer your excuse, and won’t be taken 
into consideration. 
Madam Speaker, we have these con-
versations from time to time, and we 
find them very uncomfortable, and we 
talk about things like, well, words 
matter, words hurt. Can’t we just avoid 
this? 
By doing so, we are ignoring the fact 
that we are ending a human life. I just 
tell all the Members that I come in 
contact, Aren’t you glad that your par-
ents were pro-life, and you had the 
chance to actually weigh in on it in 
your time and make a difference? 
It is an issue I don’t think should 
ever go away, and I think it is the most 
important issue that faces us today. I 
am very concerned about what is going 
on in Ukraine. I am more concerned 
with what is happening in the United 
States of America and our fellow citi-
zens looking at us to say: You need to 
make a decision. And we are saying to 
them, your individual States with the 
people you elected should have that de-
bate and they should make that deci-
sion for you. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

SUPREME COURT’S IMPENDING 
DECISION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am 
joined by my friends here this evening 
to talk about the impending decision of 
the Supreme Court and, of course, the 
things surrounding it, including the 
unfortunate, unprecedented leak of the 
information from the Court, as well as 
the, I think, heretofore unprecedented 
protesting at the homes of the Justices 
that can only legitimately be described 
as an attempt to influence and change 
their decision. We are going to get into 
all that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP), for some comments on this 
subject. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY) 
for yielding. 
The gentleman is right. You can’t 
help but notice and perhaps be dis-
tracted in an unseemly way by the 
stream of insidious attacks on the in-
stitution of the United States Supreme 
Court. It began with ideas about pack-
ing the Court, the well-known threat 
by the majority leader in the Senate 
that, ‘‘You won’t know what hit you’’ 
to the Justices of the Supreme Court, 
followed by that unprecedented leak— 
unprecedented in the history of the 
United States Supreme Court for a 
draft opinion to leak to the public. 
But we weren’t done then, because in 
the ensuing two weeks, there was the 
online publishing of information about 
the residences of the Justices of the 
Supreme Court and the appearance of 
mobs outside their houses to intimi-
date them. 
And we were not done then. Last 
night, in the Committee on the Judici-
ary of the House of Representatives, 
there were the most unseemly attacks 
on the institution of the Court. 
We can look forward and we are still 
not done, because that committee, the 
Democratic majority of that com-
mittee, has scheduled for next week a 
hearing on the Dobbs case as it pends 
for decision on the calendar of the 
Court, another unprecedented tram-
pling of institutional norms by a ma-
jority who reminds us constantly of 
their desire to protect democracy. 
But as I say, all of that threatens to 
cover over what should be a hopeful 
moment for this Nation in which we 
may, for the first time in 49 years, set 
aside a regime that has resulted in the 
loss of 61 million innocents. 
We may soon see in this Nation that 
no longer will tiny babies at the in-
stant of their formation and their first 
weeks of growth when their formative 
heart begins to beat and they can sense 
pain, be forcibly ripped, limb from 
limb, as they are extracted from their 
mother’s womb by an abortionist. 
We can aspire now, given the hope 
that emerges from what was intended 
for evil, but God may use for good, this 
opinion that says no longer will the de-
ficient logic and willful action of a Su-
preme Court majority in 1973 dictate 
the course of this Nation and commit 
us to a continuing abomination against 
the most innocent. 
The aspiration that it may come to 
pass that the abomination of Roe v. 
Wade will join Dred Scott and Plessy v. 
Ferguson and Korematsu on the ash 
heap of history, a stain upon the his-
tory of the United States, to be sure, 
but one that the Nation and those who 
have the good fortune to live within 
her confines may yet live to see re-
deemed. 
Aspiration, hope, faith that this Na-
tion may yet indeed see the living out 
of its creed. That is what I aspire to to-
night. 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman, and those are in-
deed inspiring and hopeful words as we 
stand ready to hear the Court’s final 
decision, not trying to leak it, not try-
ing to persuade it unduly, doing the 
work of democracy, of the representa-
tive Republic, speaking on behalf of 
the people that we represent, our 
bosses, so that they can decide, not 
just a few folks across the street here 
in robes, making decisions for the 
whole country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the good 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
NORMAN). 
b 1845 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman PERRY for getting this 
colloquy together. 
DAN BISHOP put it well. America is 
getting a front-row seat to a left, un-
hinged group that, on an opinion that 
was leaked—that is illegal on its face— 
can inspire people, before the decision 
is even rendered, to go to the homes of 
the Supreme Court Justices and at-
tempt to change their minds. It is ille-
gal. 
It is in Federal statute. It is punish-
able by a year in prison. Merrick Gar-
land, we call on him to enforce the law, 
to start arresting people. 
When is it going to end, folks? When 
is it going to end when a decision that 
the left doesn’t like, in anticipation, is 
going to the houses of the Supreme 
Court Justices and all the neighbors, 
disrupting a complete neighborhood 
and disrupting the lives of Justices 
who are not political figures? They are 
elected for life. 
When will we see fences stop being 
put up around the Supreme Court? Who 
would imagine? The Founders would 
have never guessed that this would 
have been coming to effect. 
Do you know what is so appalling? 
The comments from this administra-
tion and from its supporters. A quote 
by one person who is on the abortionist 
side: ‘‘If abortions aren’t safe, then you 
aren’t either.’’ 
Another quote: ‘‘The time for civility 
is over, man. Being polite doesn’t get 
you anywhere.’’ 
This is just a replay of the vandalism 
that took place all across this coun-
try—over 537 cities torn up—and a deci-
sion has not even been rendered. 
Folks, it is time for a change. It is 
time for this to stop. It is time for all 
Americans to voice their opinion and 
displeasure over this, the killing of a 
child. 
When you follow the money, that is 
where you know where the priorities 
are. For Title X funding, in the ‘23 
budget, this administration is putting

forth $400 million, a $113 million in-
crease to fund abortions that goes to 
Planned Parenthood. 
In the United Nations Population 
Fund going to countries overseas, over 
$56 million of the taxpayers’ dollars are 
going overseas when we can’t get baby 
formula. We can’t get supplies that 
Americans need. The inability of a par-
ent to tell a child that is crying into 
the middle of the night ‘‘I can’t get you 
formula’’ falls directly on this adminis-
tration. 
I commend the gentleman for doing 
this. This voice has to get louder. 
Americans are simply tired of it. To do 
this at this time in history has to be 
stopped. I think it is. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am being 
joined by some of my other colleagues 
here. Mr. NORMAN, Congressman NOR-
MAN, mentioned the baby formula. We 
are here to talk about the stain of 
abortion on our country. But we are 
watching what is happening, talking 
about children that need their formula. 
Mothers need to feed their babies. 
They can’t get it at the store, yet we 
see the shelves are full down on the 
southern border, full of baby formula. 
What about America’s babies, ladies 
and gentlemen? What about America’s 
babies? 
Look, you don’t have to take our 
word for it. We are here to talk about 
the stain of all the lost lives of the in-
nocent over these 49 years. But don’t 
take our word for it. Don’t take Repub-
licans’ word for it. 
How about Democrats? How about 
Governor Bob Casey in the Abortion 
Control Act of 1982, where he had to go 
to the Supreme Court and fight against 
Planned Parenthood for things like pa-
rental consent prior to a minor under-
going an abortion? What a novel con-
cept. Oh, so striking. 
How 
about, 
just 
yesterday, 
The 
Washington Post, not known as a bas-
tion of conservatism, saying that yes, 
experts say protests at SCOTUS Jus-
tice homes appear to be illegal, appear 
to be illegal because title 18, section 
1507 of the U.S. Code, says it is: cannot 
try and influence the decision of the 
Court. 
But the left doesn’t care. Every sin-
gle day when you wake up, you say to 
yourself, I don’t know how it could get 
much worse. I can’t believe what is 
happening, and I don’t know what else 
could get worse than it is. But then, 
every single day, something else un-
precedented happens. Today, that is oc-
curring yet again. 
If you don’t believe me or The Wash-
ington Post or Bob Casey, Governor 
Bob Casey v. Planned Parenthood—by 
the way, I am not sure how Governor 
Casey would feel about his son’s ac-
tions in the U.S. Senate when they 
voted for the most extreme position, 
which would make abortion legal at 
any point during the pregnancy, in-
cluding up until the minute of birth— 
voted for that. His father fought the 
good fight. 
But what about Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, celebrated leftist on the Court, 
celebrated believer in abortion and pro-
tector of abortion, who said that the 
1973 law did too much too fast, said 
that 
‘‘doctrinal 
limbs 
too 
swiftly 
shaped . . . may prove unstable.’’ She 
knew this was a stain on our humanity. 
She knew. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
am grateful to the gentleman for 
chairing the Freedom Caucus, and we 
are grateful for his leadership and for 
having this Special Order tonight. 
I want to take a moment in my open-
ing remarks to say thank you to those 
Supreme Court Justices who, right 
now, are experiencing tremendous and 
unjust 
treatment 
and 
intimidation 
from a radical left mob that is abso-
lutely out of control. 
Many of us have been in the battle 
for life for decades. We are grateful, fi-
nally, that this horrendous stain on 
America’s history is potentially com-
ing to an end, and those who have 
stood for our Constitution, Supreme 
Court Justices Alito, Coney Barrett, 
Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Thomas, we 
all take a moment to say a huge thank 
you to them for standing up for the 
Constitution, for standing up for the 
unborn, and doing the right thing. 
We want them to know that we and 
millions of other Americans are stand-
ing with them in deep gratitude this 
evening. Never should anyone in this 
country but, at this point, our Supreme 
Court Justices never, ever, ever should 
they be afraid of the leftist mob be-
cause they are doing their jobs as Su-
preme Court Justices to stand for the 
Constitution and to correct unconsti-
tutional law in this case as it comes 
their way. Yet, now, they are facing 
great intimidation by the radical left 
agenda. 
We, millions of Americans, are abso-
lutely disgusted by what we are watch-
ing on television as a result of what 
has already been described tonight, an 
unprecedented and I believe to be prob-
ably an intentional leak of Justice 
Alito’s decision, the majority decision 
in this case, Dobbs v. Jackson. How in 
the world does that leak happen? We 
fully will get to the bottom of that 
with some investigations in the future. 
The behavior now of the left is unac-
ceptable. It is illegal. It needs to be 
dealt with. There needs to be account-
ability. This is absolutely bringing out 
the worst of the radical left in this 
country, and I hope every American 
sees it. I hope they see it for what it is. 
Here is the Supreme Court Justices 
doing 
their 
job. 
There 
are 
three 
branches, 
equal 
branches, 
separate 
branches. This branch, the judicial 
branch, and, in this case, the Supreme 
Court are doing their job and facing 
the wrath of radical leftists simply be-
cause they don’t like the decision. 
We have fallen so far as a country. 
We have come to the point that now we 
are willing to end innocent life and rip 
little baby boys or girls from their 
mothers’ wombs. 
I mean, here we have 5 weeks, the 
child has a heartbeat; 10 weeks, arms, 
legs, fingers, toes; 15 weeks, a fully de-
veloped heart, capable of feeling pain. 
It is a child in the womb. It is abso-
lutely amazing. 
Enough is enough. It is time that we 
hold these people accountable. It is 
time that we come behind our Supreme 
Court Justices. Whether anyone agrees 
with the decision or not, they are doing 
their job. We obviously agree with the 
decision. But they are doing their job, 
and they need to be protected. 
We cannot allow the highest court of 
our land and our Constitution to be put 
in jeopardy as it is now. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for leading this time, this Spe-
cial Order, giving each of us an oppor-
tunity to stand for our Constitution, to 
stand for our Supreme Court, and to 
stand for life. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, the good 
gentleman from Georgia reminded me, 
as I said, you don’t have to believe us 
Republicans. He reminded me that 
President Biden said this is a child, 
what we have known all our lives. But 
don’t believe us if you don’t want to. 
Believe your President. He said it is a 
child. So we know, right? And we are 
so grateful. 
As people who love life, love the pro-
tection of life guaranteed in the Con-
stitution, we have suffered and prayed 
for 49 years. We didn’t like the decision 
49 years ago, in 1973. We didn’t like it, 
but we didn’t do the wrong thing. We 
used the system appropriately, as it 
was designed by the Founders and the 
Framers of our great country, to re-
move the stain of the loss of innocent 
life from our laws. We are on the edge 
of that. 
But the point is that there is a right 
way to do things. Even though we dis-
agree on occasion, we are a country of 
laws. If it is going to be okay to break 
the law just because you disagree with 
a decision, well, that is not a country 
that is going to endure very long. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Montana (Mr. ROSENDALE). 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the tremendous chairman of the 
Freedom Caucus, the tip of the spear 
for this body, the conscience of the 
conservative movement here in Wash-
ington, D.C. I am proud to stand here 
with him to be a voice for life today. 
It is painfully ironic to me as I look 
back that, in 1973, the same year that 
the Endangered Species Act was passed 
to protect endangered plants and ani-
mals, our Supreme Court made that 
terrible, flawed decision in Roe v. 
Wade, allowing abortions to take place. 
Now, I don’t know how many wolves 
or how many bears have been saved 
since 1973, but I can tell you that 63 
million children have been killed. 
Sixty-three million children have been 
killed since that day. 
Roe v. Wade created abortions on the 
basis of a supposed right to privacy 
under the 14th Amendment, but they

forget about the guarantees in our Con-
stitution to life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. The very first prom-
ise that we have from our creator is 
life. 
The Dobbs decision would suspend 
the Federal protection of abortions and 
finally return this question back to the 
States. 
When we leave here, after this deci-
sion is finally released, and we are all 
are very optimistic that it is going to 
overturn Roe v. Wade, let us not rest, 
folks. Let us not rest. We are still 
going to have to go back to our respec-
tive State legislatures and give them 
the support and give them the guidance 
that they are going to need to make 
sure that they protect the lives of the 
unborn. 
Let’s be very clear about this. Demo-
crats, not Republicans, are the ones 
who are out of step with the American 
public. The rest of the world, they are 
out of step with them. Today, they 
continue to push for taxpayer-funded 
death on demand. Let’s call it what it 
is. We are no longer talking about 
yanking an unborn child from a moth-
er’s womb. 
The Democrats are so out of step 
they are literally having discussions 
about whether they will kill a child 
once it is outside of its mother. Tax-
payer-funded death on demand is what 
they are trying to push forward, and I 
am so proud that all the Members are 
standing here to fight against that 
today. 
Roe v. Wade was outdated and was 
made before scientific advances helped 
us understand the clear humanity of 
the unborn child. An unborn life is a 
separate, unique individual with its 
own DNA. 
Let’s follow the science. That is what 
they always say. Let’s follow the 
science, our friends to the left. Well, 
let’s follow the science. That child has 
separate and unique DNA. It is a new 
person. 
Let’s protect it. 
b 1900 
I have always been a staunch sup-
porter and defender of the most vulner-
able, especially the children. My wife 
and I have participated in pro-life 
marches across the State of Montana 
in many, many different cities and mu-
nicipalities. This is the first year that 
we were able to join many people here 
in Washington, D.C., our Nation’s Cap-
ital—the encouragement and the en-
thusiasm amongst the tens of thou-
sands of people to protect life was over-
whelming. 
Madam Speaker, I have three chil-
dren; I have three sons. I can remember 
the first time that I held my children, 
each and every one of them. I looked at 
their faces to see if they matched mine, 
to see if they had that little dimple in 
their chin. I looked to see if they had 
all 10 of their fingers and 10 of their 
toes. 
I will tell you that I thanked God 
that each one of them was a healthy 
human being that he had gifted to my 
wife and I and gave us the responsi-
bility to nurture that child. 
I now have the experience of doing 
the exact same thing with a grand-
daughter; to look into her face and see 
this precious individual. I look at my 
son and my daughter-in-law and know 
that this child is dependent upon them 
for safety, food, and protection, and 
know that they are going to do the 
exact same thing that I have been 
blessed to do with them. 
Every life is precious, not perfect. 
Every life is precious. That is what we 
need to remember today. We have an 
obligation 
to 
protect 
each 
one, 
healthy, imperfect, or infirm. 
I pledge to you, God as my judge, 
that I will do that just as long as I am 
able to take in air and breathe. 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman. Indeed, life is 
precious. It is a blessing. It is a gift. As 
a parent there is nothing like it. We 
have lamented these last 49 years in 
the loss of these innocent lives, and 
that our country could stand for that 
and support that; not only just support 
it, but go out and campaign for it with 
our tax dollars, with our rhetoric, with 
our policies around the globe. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the 
United States of America where you 
are guaranteed by our Creator, and or-
dained in the Constitution, the gift of 
life, the blessing of life, the first gift, 
the first blessing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman PERRY for leading the House 
Freedom Caucus and for leading this 
Special Order. 
The Declaration of Independence— 
what an incredible document that 
was—that was truly the birth certifi-
cate, I believe, of our Nation. It was 
the promise, I would call it, and the 
Constitution was the fulfillment of 
that promise. 
In the Declaration of Independence, 
it says—and you have heard this men-
tioned tonight, but I echo it: ‘‘We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness.’’ 
The 
very 
first 
among 
those 
unalienable rights is life. ‘‘That to se-
cure these rights, governments are in-
stituted among men.’’ 
So who is responsible for securing 
that right of life? Well, that is the gov-
ernment—‘‘deriving their just powers 
from the consent of the governed.’’ 
That is us. That is the American peo-
ple. That is who consents to the gov-
ernment. 
That right of life is endowed by our 
Creator—by God. God gives you a right. 
Who can take it away? I don’t think 
anyone can take it away. Our Declara-
tion recognizes that some people will 
try, and so our government is supposed 
to protect that right. 
I am so thankful that our Supreme 
Court, which is one of our coequal 
branches of government, that they ac-
tually stood up after 49 years to defend 
that right to life. 
I echo my friend, Congressman JODY 
HICE from the great State of Georgia— 
Georgia’s 10th District, just a little bit 
below mine—I echo his sentiments in 
thanking the Justices that stood for 
life: Justice Samuel Alito, who actu-
ally had to be moved from his residence 
because of the threats; Justice Clar-
ence Thomas; Neil Gorsuch; Brett 
Kavanaugh; and Amy Coney Barrett. 
I think we as a nation should be tell-
ing these Justices: Thank you, thank 
you, and thank you. How many mil-
lions more lives will be saved because 
of this decision that—though it is not 
final—we believe will be final and will 
come out in a month? We need to en-
courage them for standing up and de-
fending life. 
I think that is so very important be-
cause what we have seen so far has 
been absolutely despicable when it 
comes from the radical left and their 
threats to the Supreme Court. 
There is a reason that the Supreme 
Court Justices are confirmed for life on 
the bench, and that is so they are not 
intimidated. Here we have someone in 
the Supreme Court that leaked a draft 
decision with what I believe was the in-
tent to intimidate, so maybe one of 
those Justices would change their 
mind. I am praying that they don’t. 
From what we see, they will not. 
Thank God for that. 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the good gentleman and all my 
colleagues. Our time is almost over, 
but I just want to reiterate that we— 
these Members here and many others 
on this side of the aisle, in particular— 
stand for life. 
We stand for the Constitution which 
guarantees that life. We stand for the 
rights enumerated in the Constitution 
that are given to us by God—granted to 
us by God. As my friend said: Can’t be 
taken away—even though some will 
try. When God gives them to you, they 
can’t be taken away. That is all by de-
sign. 
We stand for the rule of law en-
shrined in the Constitution that folks 
that would wish to subvert the rule of 
law—try and color the Court’s deci-
sion—they should be held accountable. 
All men are created equal under the 
law. Apparently, under this adminis-
tration some are more equal than oth-
ers. 
Madam Speaker, that is the recipe 
for anarchy. We are thankful for this 
opportunity to speak to our bosses, our 
employers, the ones who rule over us, 
the good Lord, and our constituents 
this evening. 
Madam Speaker, we are thankful for 
the time to speak on this very impor-
tant issue, stand for the Constitution, 
stand for the law, and importantly, 
stand for life. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MAY 12, 2022 
No. 81 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
Today’s opening prayer will be of-
fered by our guest Chaplain, CAPT 
Washington Johnson II, CHC, USNR 
Deputy Chaplain, Navy Region Hawaii. 
The guest Chaplain offered the fol-
lowing prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, who reigns in splen-
dor and majesty, we acknowledge Your 
divine power as we seek the blessings 
that will sustain and guide us through 
this day’s journey. We pray that Your 
presence will fill this Chamber and 
that You would grant our Senators suf-
ficient wisdom, knowledge, and under-
standing with the deliberations and de-
cisions that will be made. 
We thank You for this Nation’s indel-
ible history, and we ask Your blessings 
of protection upon it as we look for-
ward to the glorious day that the 
Prophet Isaiah wrote about that pro-
claims: 
He shall judge between the nations, And 
rebuke many people; They shall beat their 
swords into plowshares, And their spears 
into pruning hooks; Nation shall not lift up 
sword against nation, Neither shall they 
learn war anymore. 
This is my prayer in the name of Him 
that is eternal. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Morn-
ing business is closed. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE—Resumed 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the motion to dis-
charge, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A motion to discharge Mary T. Boyle, of 
Maryland, to be a Commissioner of the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission for a 
term of seven years from October 27, 2018, 
from the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT OF 2022 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, the American people saw for 
themselves the glaring contrast be-
tween Democrats, who will fight to 
protect women’s rights to make deci-
sions about their own bodies, and 
MAGA Republicans pushing to send 
mothers and doctors to jail and insti-
tute nationwide abortion bans. 
With Roe on the brink of elimi-
nation, this issue will not go away. As 
Americans vote later this year, they 
will choose between radical MAGA Re-
publicans, who want to get rid of Roe, 
push national bans on abortion, and 
even throw doctors and women in jail, 
or pro-choice Democrats, who will pro-
tect a woman’s right to make her own 
decisions when it comes to her body. 
Let me say that again. 
The contrast facing the American 
people is now simple: Either elect more 
MAGA Republicans, who want to push 
for sweeping national bans on abortion, 
or support pro-choice Democrats, who 
will protect a woman’s rights to make 
her own decisions about her body. 
Either elect more MAGA Repub-
licans, who want forced pregnancies 
and who champion bans without excep-
tions even for rape or incest, or support 
pro-choice Democrats, who will protect 
a woman’s right to make her own deci-
sions. 
Either elect more MAGA Repub-
licans, who want to prosecute and even 
imprison women and doctors for car-
rying out abortions—and mere friends 
who give rides to clinics—or support 
pro-choice Democrats, who will protect 
a woman’s rights. 
Americans are going to see that con-
trast again and again and again as 
Democrats keep highlighting this very 
important and vital issue. 
And as much as Republicans will try 
to deflect, distort, or distract, the 
unbendable truth is that their anti- 
women views are wildly out of step 
with the American people. Just look at 
what is happening across the country. 
Democrats across the country are con-
fidently highlighting their support for 
a woman’s right to make her own 
choices; and while the MAGA Repub-
licans may want to brag about their 
plans for a nationwide abortion ban 
and sending women and doctors to jail, 
the clear majority of Americans dis-
agrees with that extremist position. 
That is why Republican campaign com-
mittees are urging their candidates to 
avoid the subject of abortion—because 
they know their views are out of step.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2466 
May 12, 2022 
Again, Democrats across the country 
are now talking about this issue, even 
doing campaign ads about this issue. 
The Republican spinmeisters are tell-
ing their colleagues to avoid the issue. 
So it is obvious to everyone who is on 
what side. 
Republicans can run but can’t hide 
from the horror they have created. 
Yesterday’s vote was only one step, not 
the end, of our fight to protect wom-
en’s rights. This issue will keep coming 
back up again and again and again be-
tween now and when voters go to the 
polls later this year. 
UKRAINE 
Madam President, on Ukraine, in the 
immediate future, Republicans need to 
work with Democrats to pass another 
round of critical emergency funding for 
the people of Ukraine. We have a moral 
obligation to act and to act swiftly. 
The House already passed a Ukraine 
package with overwhelming bipartisan 
support. It should be no different here 
in the Senate. Both of our caucuses 
heard loud and clear from the Ukrain-
ian Ambassador earlier this week that 
time is of the essence. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
work with Democrats to get a funding 
package done as soon as possible— 
ASAP. Republicans shouldn’t block 
this bill. There is no reason—no reason 
whatsoever—not to get Ukraine fund-
ing approved fast. 
I also call on my colleagues to swift-
ly pass additional legislation to arm 
the Federal Government with the tools 
needed to liquidate assets seized from 
Russian oligarchs—yachts, mansions, 
private jets, art collections, and more. 
It should be a no-brainer to provide the 
tools necessary to go after crooked 
Russian oligarchs, but, nevertheless, 
House Republicans bewilderingly op-
posed adding these tools in the House 
package. The Senate should do better. 
Both parties should work quickly and 
decisively to get this done through reg-
ular order. This issue can certainly 
be—it should certainly be—a bipartisan 
issue. 
As the war in Ukraine enters its 
third bloody month, we must leave no 
stone unturned in making Putin and 
his cronies pay a price and in helping 
the 
Ukrainian 
people. 
Their 
fight 
against Russian aggression is a strug-
gle 
between 
democracy 
and 
authoritarianism itself, so there should 
be no question—no question—about 
which side America stands on. 
Again, I urge my Republican col-
leagues not to block this legislation 
but to work with us to quickly get this 
passed through the Chamber. Everyone 
can have their own idea, but if every-
one has their own idea, we will get 
nothing done. We have to come to-
gether on a bill that has gotten broad 
bipartisan support in the House and in 
the Senate. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, on nominations, it 
has been a productive week on the Sen-
ate floor when it comes to nomina-
tions. Earlier this week, the Senate fi-
nally confirmed a highly qualified and 
historic nominee to serve on the Fed-
eral Reserve Board of Governors: Lisa 
Cook. 
Coming from humble beginnings in 
rural Georgia, where her family fought 
segregation, Ms. Cook will be the first 
Black woman to ever sit on the Federal 
Reserve Board of Governors. She is a 
professor of economics at Michigan 
State, a member of the Federal Re-
serve 
Bank 
of 
Chicago’s 
Advisory 
Board, and she served as a senior econ-
omist on President Obama’s Council of 
Economic Advisers. She absolutely be-
longs on the Board, and I am glad she 
was finally confirmed. 
Yesterday, we also confirmed Alvaro 
Bedoya as a Commissioner on the Fed-
eral Trade Commission, breaking a 
2-to-2 deadlock that has kept the FTC 
from full strength for over a year. 
Mr. Bedoya’s nomination is fantastic 
news for the American people. The FTC 
will be empowered to fight against 
price gougers, market manipulators, 
and go after bad actors using anti-com-
petitive practices to drive up prices. 
We have been urging the FTC, for in-
stance, to look at market manipula-
tion and price gouging when it comes 
to gasoline, and now they will have the 
ability to do so because the Republican 
Commissioners refuse to move forward, 
but now we have a majority of Demo-
crats on that Commission. 
This week, the Senate also confirmed 
another Fed nominee, Philip Jefferson, 
and secured Democratic majorities on 
important labor-focused Agencies, in-
cluding the Federal Labor Relations 
Authority. Next week, we will also 
start the process to confirm more 
Democrats to the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission. 
Finally, later today, the Senate will 
vote on Jerome Powell to serve an-
other term as Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve. Few institutions are more im-
portant to help steer our economy in 
the right direction—and to fight infla-
tion—than the Fed. Chairman Powell 
presided as Fed Chair during some of 
the most challenging moments in mod-
ern American history. I thank all of 
my colleagues—particularly Senator 
BROWN, chairman of our Banking Com-
mittee—who have worked to move for-
ward with this important nomination. 
U.S. INNOVATION AND COMPETITION ACT 
Madam President, finally on USICA, 
today, our bipartisan jobs and competi-
tion bill will take another step forward 
when the conference committee holds 
its first public meeting. 
The jobs and competition legislation 
is just what the doctor ordered to boost 
our economy, bring manufacturing jobs 
back home, and lower costs for Amer-
ican families. Many across the country 
want to see this bill done. A recent let-
ter from over 240 State and local cham-
bers of commerce called on Congress to 
act, citing its importance for critical 
technologies like semiconductors. 
One economic analysis also found 
that enacting this bill would help add 
or preserve as many as 3 million jobs to 
the U.S. economy—3 million jobs. And 
it could be more as new innovations 
and new markets unlock new opportu-
nities yet unknown. 
There is still a lot of work to do be-
fore we send this jobs bill to the Presi-
dent’s desk, and not everyone is going 
to get what they want. But even so, to-
day’s first public meeting is a great 
step forward. The bill is the most wor-
thy and important effort, one that will 
pay dividends for years to come. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
for 
months, 
the 
brave 
people 
of 
Ukraine have been fighting valiantly in 
a war they did not ask for. Their de-
fense of their homeland from the Rus-
sian invasion has already far surpassed 
the expectations of all the skeptics. 
Ukraine is not asking anybody else 
to do their fighting for them. They ask 
only for the resources they need to de-
fend themselves against this lawless 
aggression. 
I strongly support the next package 
of lethal military assistance which the 
House 
has 
passed 
with 
an 
over-
whelming bipartisan majority. I hope 
the Senate can reach an agreement to 
consider 
and 
pass 
this 
legislation 
today. The Ukrainians need it. We need 
to do it today. 
Helping Ukraine is not an instance of 
mere philanthropy. It bears directly on 
America’s national security and vital 
interests that Russia’s naked aggres-
sion not succeed and carries significant 
costs. If Ukraine fails to repel Russian 
aggression, there is no question that 
the threat to America and European 
security will actually grow. 
Our Nation’s history is packed— 
packed—with painful reminders that 
America cannot wish away global prob-
lems that affect us and our allies sim-
ply by burying our head in the sand. 
I applaud the strong Republican vote 
for this crucial assistance over in the 
House and urge my Senate colleagues 
on both sides to help us pass this ur-
gent funding bill today. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Madam President, now on another 
matter, 2 years ago, the Democratic 
leader addressed a crowd on the steps 
of the Supreme Court and threatened 
Justices if they didn’t rule the way he 
wanted. Now far-left crowds are sur-
rounding 
Justices’ 
private 
family 
homes. They want to use intimidation 
to influence the outcome in a pending 
case. It should be easy for leaders to 
condemn. All Americans should agree

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2467 
May 12, 2022 
that judges and juries ought not to be 
subjected to threats or intimidation 
campaigns. 
Admirably, some on the political left 
have spoken out against this fringe ele-
ment. The Washington Post editorial 
board has condemned this. The No. 2 
Senate Democrat, our colleague from 
Illinois, said: 
I think it’s reprehensible. Stay away from 
homes and families. 
His counterpart across the Capitol, 
the No. 2 House Democrat, Leader 
HOYER, said: 
We need to protect Supreme Court Justices 
and their families, period. We’re a nation of 
laws, not of violence, not of intimidation 
. . . laws. 
That was STENY HOYER. 
But Leader SCHUMER and the White 
House will not follow suit. They won’t 
condemn the harassment. They have 
basically endorsed it. And top Demo-
crats are standing in the way of con-
crete action. 
A few days ago, the Senate unani-
mously passed legislation to give the 
Supreme Court’s in-house police force 
some additional authorities they need 
to do their jobs. This isn’t controver-
sial stuff. It cleared this Chamber 
unanimously. But House Democrats 
have been unwilling to promptly pass 
it. 
Congressman 
JEFFRIES
suggested 
yesterday 
this 
uncontroversial 
bill 
might be shunted into a lengthy com-
mittee process. Why in the world would 
that be done? These are essentially 
clerical fixes. They breezed through the 
Senate without objection. But House 
Democratic leadership wants to drag 
this out with hearings and markups, 
while 
mobs 
assemble 
at 
people’s 
houses? 
I 
hope 
this 
is 
some 
misunder-
standing. I hope Democrats are not in-
tentionally 
stalling 
these 
security 
measures until after the Court has 
issued its rulings. This would be rep-
rehensible. 
At the end of Pennsylvania Avenue, 
either President Biden or Attorney 
General Garland has apparently de-
cided not to enforce Federal law. Like 
I explained on Monday, section 1507 of 
the Criminal Code makes it a crime 
right now to picket or parade with the 
intent of influencing a judge at loca-
tions that include a judge’s residence. 
That is the law right now. People have 
been doing exactly that for days and 
days right now. But the Garland Jus-
tice Department is nowhere in sight. 
One would think a DOJ, run by the 
former chief judge of the DC Circuit, 
would need no prodding—no prodding— 
to protect judicial safety and judicial 
independence. But at least so far, the 
Attorney 
General 
was 
quicker 
to 
pounce on concerned parents at school 
board meetings. 
The Governors of Maryland and Vir-
ginia have had to write a joint letter to 
the Attorney General begging him to 
make his U.S. attorneys do their job 
and uphold the law. 
So, yesterday, I sent the DOJ my own 
letter asking the very same question. 
The Senate needs answers right now, 
and the Court needs security right 
now. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Madam President, on a related mat-
ter, yesterday, we observed the begin-
ning of ceremonies honoring National 
Police Week. Soon we will mark Peace 
Officers Memorial Day. 
Tens of thousands of law enforcement 
personnel from across the country will 
gather here in our Nation’s Capital to 
honor the service and the sacrifice of 
their fallen brothers and sisters. 
I would like to extend a warm wel-
come to the Kentuckians who have 
traveled here for the ceremonies. I am 
meeting with several of these law en-
forcement leaders this week to express 
my gratitude for their service. 
The Commonwealth is home to every 
type of law enforcement officer you 
can imagine, from big city beat cops to 
smalltown sheriffs. They take a great 
risk every day to protect and to serve. 
This week, I am thinking especially 
about the law enforcement officers 
Kentucky lost in the past year whose 
names will be added to the National 
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial 
tomorrow—heroes like Graves County 
jailer Robert T. Daniel, who sacrificed 
his own life to save endangered in-
mates as a tornado bore down on their 
workplace in which he was employed; 
community pillars like Jefferson Coun-
ty Deputy Sheriff Brandon Shirley, 
who was shot and killed while working 
a second job in his uniform; role mod-
els 
like 
Louisville 
Police 
Officer 
Zachary Cottongim, who was struck 
and killed by a car while attending to 
an abandoned vehicle on the side of the 
road. 
Yesterday, 
I 
met 
with 
Officer 
Cottongim’s widow and former partner 
who are here in Washington for tomor-
row’s memorial. We are all praying for 
them as they mourn this tragic loss. 
I am proud to cosponsor the resolu-
tion that officially designated National 
Police Week this year. America’s law 
enforcement 
personnel 
are 
always 
there when we need them most. The 
least—the least—Congress can do is 
have their backs. 
INFLATION 
Madam President, now on one final 
matter, parents across the country are 
struggling to get their hands on the in-
fant formula their babies need. Here 
are just a few of the letters I have re-
ceived from parents and grandparents 
in my State: 
We have been struggling to get formula for 
our granddaughter for months now. The situ-
ation has turned dire. 
My 6-month-old Ezekiel has had to switch 
what he needs twice since his birth due to 
the shortages. 
Another: 
We traveled from Lexington, Kentucky 
through West Virginia and Virginia into 
Washington 
D.C. 
[but] 
every 
place 
we 
stopped . . . had empty shelves of baby for-
mula. 
This outrageous, unacceptable situa-
tion has been unfolding in slow motion 
over several months. Much of it stems 
from a recall that resulted in a plant 
being shut down. But it seems that 
while President Biden’s administration 
and the FDA knew all about this prob-
lem as it developed, they have been 
asleep at the switch in terms of getting 
production back online as fast as pos-
sible. 
Both 
Republican 
and 
Democratic 
Senators have asked the White House 
and FDA for answers and gotten very 
few. The administration has got to be 
more proactive and forward-leaning. 
But yesterday, I understand that a 
White House spokeswoman wasn’t even 
sure if they had a point person for this 
problem or, if they had such a person, 
who it might be. 
Even before the acute shortages, 
soaring costs were also squeezing fami-
lies. The inflation figures show the 
price of baby food has skyrocketed 13 
percent in just 12 months. Overall food 
inflation is 9.4 percent year-over-year. 
That is the worst year for food infla-
tion in 41 years. 
It should not be this hard for Ameri-
cans to feed their families. Parents 
need President Biden and his team to 
step up to the plate. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 1 
million deaths—unbelievable. But this 
week, it became very, very real. One 
million of our fellow Americans now 
have died from COVID, 1 million par-
ents, grandparents, siblings, children, 
friends, neighbors. That is more Ameri-
cans who lost their lives than the cas-
ualties in World War I, World War II, or 
the Civil War. That is the size of San 
Jose, CA, the 10th largest city in our 
Nation. 
But behind those 7 stark figures are 
real people, including more than 33,600 
in my home State of Illinois. One of 
those was a woman named Maria Elena 
Sifuentes. Maria lived in Chicago, 
where she worked at Communities 
United and organized for housing and 
education equity in her community. 
She had received her first COVID shot 
when she contracted the virus last 
summer. She passed away on June 10 at 
the age of 57 and left behind five chil-
dren. 
We also grieve the loss of Sergeant 
Ken 
Thurman 
and 
Officer 
Brian 
Shields, two 51-year-old veteran police 
officers who worked in Aurora at the 
police department. They succumbed to 
COVID infections last year, both with-
in the same week. 
When the pandemic first hit, this de-
gree of loss was unimaginable. Some 
people dismissed COVID–19 and said 
that it was just like the ordinary flu

and that it would go away and mysteri-
ously disappear. But now that we have 
crossed this tragic threshold, we must 
take stock of where we are and where 
we are headed. 
More than 2 years into this pan-
demic, COVID is still a threat to Amer-
ica and the world. In fact, infections 
nationwide are up 50 percent over the 
past 2 weeks. Hospitalizations are up 20 
percent. That is the case in Illinois as 
well as our neighbors in the region. 
The Commonwealth of Kentucky, home 
of Minority Leader MCCONNELL, had 
the highest COVID death rate in the 
country over the past week. 
The one thing worse than being 
swamped with another wave of COVID 
cases 
is 
being 
caught 
unprepared. 
Right now, we are sleepwalking into 
the next potentially deadly wave, and 
we know the virus will continue to mu-
tate and pose threats. We need to learn 
from our 2 years of experience with 
Delta and Omicron and act now and be 
ready, be prepared. 
Over the weekend, the Biden admin-
istration warned that new subvariants 
could fuel a wave that is forecast to in-
fect 100 million Americans—almost a 
third of our population—over this fall 
and winter. Yet last week, Health and 
Human Services Secretary Becerra tes-
tified to the Senate Appropriations 
Committee: ‘‘[B]ut in order to be ready 
for that, we have to start purchasing 
today.’’ 
That 
is 
what 
Secretary 
Becerra said. If we wait for the surge to 
hit, it is too late. 
Last week, it also was reported that 
the administration will run out of 
COVID vaccines by September 1 if the 
FDA authorizes second boosters for all 
adults. How can America be caught in 
this situation again—even with vac-
cines—unprepared? 
Because Federal funding has dried up 
to reimburse hospitals and health cen-
ters for testing, we don’t have a com-
plete picture of how many new infec-
tions are actually showing up. The Uni-
versity of Washington estimates the 
true number of infections is five times 
higher than official reports. 
So the alarm bells are ringing, and a 
looming vaccine crisis is right around 
the corner. Other countries in the 
world get it. They understand it. They 
are racing ahead of us to secure sup-
plies of vaccines, but because of resist-
ance from Republicans in Washington, 
we are not doing that. 
So why won’t the Senate act to pass 
this COVID legislation—obviously nec-
essary legislation—right now? It was 
more than a month ago that Senators 
Schumer and Romney, together with 
half-a-dozen bipartisan Senators, an-
nounced a $10 billion emergency COVID 
package. It is not everything we want; 
it is not everything we need; but it is 
an urgent measure that seeks to ad-
dress the crisis. 
Instead of just getting this done, pol-
itics were inserted. There were de-
mands for amendments or else. The 
process broke down. Instead of getting 
the job done, Republicans are playing 
politics. They are demanding poison 
pill riders on issues unrelated, like im-
migration. 
With summer approaching, Ameri-
cans are eager to keep the face masks 
off for good and move past the pan-
demic. I get it. Everybody wants the 
kids back in school. They want them 
home for vacation. They want to take 
family vacations. They want to go out 
to dinner—all things that are part of 
the joy of life. I share the sentiment, 
but we have to deal with the reality of 
this virus. It is changing every day, 
and it has surprised us so many times 
before. 
Even the most persuasive political 
speech isn’t going to change the course 
of this virus. Rather than reacting to 
whatever deadly curve ball gets thrown 
at us next, we must be ready before-
hand with the right tools to keep us 
moving in the right direction. I don’t 
want to come to the floor to mark 11⁄2 
million dead Americans or 2 million 
dead Americans due to the virus. 
The time to provide additional fund-
ing is not now; it was weeks ago. It is 
incredible to me that, after what this 
Nation has gone through—1 million 
dead Americans—we are still debating 
over whether we should be prepared for 
the next stage of the virus. Shame on 
the politicians who are inserting poli-
tics into a life-and-death debate. 
Without this funding, we could very 
well lose the progress we have made in 
containing COVID. We cannot tolerate 
that sort of setback, especially at this 
pivotal 
moment 
where 
continued 
progress puts us on the cusp of what we 
dreamed of 2 years ago: finally putting 
an end to this pandemic, finally return-
ing to normal. 
While Senate Democrats and the 
Biden administration have taken tre-
mendous strides with getting shots in 
arms, supporting local businesses, and 
getting our kids back in school, we 
still have a lot to do. 
To my Republican colleagues: Drop 
the political antics. Join us in making 
this responsible investment to save 
lives and prevent the pandemic from 
once again spinning out of control. We 
know a new wave could be coming, and 
we need to sit down and face this pub-
lic health issue for the reality that it 
is. 
Let’s not waste time with irrelevant, 
anti-immigrant 
rhetoric. 
Let’s 
do 
something that helps the American 
people and work together to drive 
America’s recovery forward. 
PROTESTS 
Madam President, we had a meeting 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee 
this morning, and the committee dis-
cussed at the outset threats that have 
been reported against judges, Justices, 
their families, and their homes. This 
committee has responded with a bill— 
a bipartisan bill—by Senators Cornyn 
and Coons to provide more security 
protection for the Supreme Court. I 
fully endorse it, and I am glad that it 
passed unanimously. It should have. 
There have been complaints this 
week about demonstrations in front of 
the homes of Justices and others. I 
have made my position clear. I think 
that such demonstrations are totally 
unnecessary, unwise, and should be dis-
couraged. In some cases, they are rep-
rehensible. 
The pressure that is trying to be ap-
plied on these officials by protesters, 
whether they are for or against a cer-
tain issue, are just unacceptable. I 
stand by that position, and I believe 
that Democrats and Republicans agree 
that we have to be serious about pro-
tecting those who are elected to public 
office at every level from harassment, 
intimidation, and, above all, from any 
violence. 
I condemn those attacks on anti- 
abortion organizations in two States: 
Wisconsin and Oregon. The fire-bomb-
ing that took place in one—that is un-
acceptable. Violence is never accept-
able in a democracy. 
Having said that, I beg my Repub-
lican colleagues to show some consist-
ency. I was here January 6, 2021, when 
this insurrectionist mob, inspired by 
President Trump, came up, crashed 
down the windows and floors into this 
Capitol, and marched on this Chamber. 
I was on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
when we were advised by the Capitol 
Police to evacuate as quickly as pos-
sible to save our own lives. I was in 
this building when several of the Cap-
itol Police stepped up and showed dra-
matic heroism. Some of them lost their 
lives as a result of it. 
Five to seven people died on January 
6, 2021, as a result of what happened 
that day. A hundred and fifty law en-
forcement officials were attacked. And 
how did the Republicans respond to 
that? Senator MCCONNELL personally 
stopped any effort at a bipartisan com-
mission to determine what caused that 
attack and how to avoid it in the fu-
ture. He personally came to the floor 
and objected. I heard him do it. 
The 
only 
investigation 
that 
has 
taken place is in the Democratic House 
of Representatives and, thank good-
ness, several Republican Congressmen 
and women have stepped forward. 
I want to salute from my own State 
Republican 
Congressman 
ADAM 
KINZINGER. He joined this bipartisan ef-
fort to investigate January 6, 2021. He 
is retiring now. He paid a heavy price 
for his decision, but it was a principled 
decision. I respect him for it. 
The same with Congresswoman LIZ 
CHENEY. We probably don’t agree on 
half a dozen issues, but I have to tell 
you, I admire her and respect her cour-
age for stepping up and saying she 
wanted the investigation in the House 
to be bipartisan and, therefore, she was 
going to be part of the panel. I respect 
her very much for that. 
Next month, we are going to have 
public hearings in the House of Rep-
resentatives on this issue. We should 
have had a bipartisan commission 
looking at January 6, 2021, but Senator 
MCCONNELL
and Republicans stopped 
it.

Committee say in the official release

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2469 
May 12, 2022 
about the January 6, 2021, insurrec-
tionist mob that crashed through the 
Capitol here, desecrating it, endan-
gering the lives of innocent people— 
what did they say about it? They called 
it ‘‘legitimate political discourse’’—le-
gitimate political discourse—with five 
to seven people dead and 150 police offi-
cers assaulted. That is illegitimate; 
that is unacceptable, whether the in-
tended victims were Members of Con-
gress or the victims today are members 
of the Supreme Court. 
Have the good sense, I say to my Re-
publican colleagues, to be consistent. If 
you are opposed to violence and believe 
it is unacceptable in a democratic soci-
ety, make that standard apply whether 
the victims are in one branch of the 
government or another. It is absolutely 
unacceptable in both. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, if 
Democrats have made one thing clear 
over the past 16 months, it is that they 
think that the Federal Government—or 
maybe just Democrats—knows best. It 
is evident in just about everything 
they do. And there is pretty much no 
end to the things they think the Fed-
eral Government should be in charge 
of—healthcare, 
childcare, education, 
elections, and the list goes on. 
Take the current debate over abor-
tion. There is one thing Democrats are 
clearly terrified of is putting this issue 
in the hands of the American people. 
Overturning Roe v. Wade would return 
the issue of abortion back to the people 
and 
their 
elected 
representatives. 
Democrats are keen to make sure that 
doesn’t happen, probably because they 
know the American people are not in 
agreement with Democrats’ extreme 
abortion agenda. 
And so the news that the Supreme 
Court might overturn Roe and return 
the issue of abortion to people has been 
met with hysteria from Democrats. 
More than one has responded by calling 
for packing the Supreme Court so the 
Democrats can ensure they get the 
abortion decisions they desire. 
Of course, yesterday, Democrats re-
sponded to the Supreme Court’s pend-
ing decision by holding a vote on what 
has to be the most extreme abortion 
legislation ever considered by the U.S. 
Congress—a bill that would rip away 
even the smallest protections for the 
unborn and make abortion-on-demand, 
at any time, for essentially any reason, 
the law of the land. 
Meanwhile, today, the Senate Budget 
Committee is holding a hearing on a fa-
vorite Democratic proposal—putting 
the Democrats in charge of Americans’ 
healthcare. Under Medicare for All, 
Americans can look forward to a future 
in which the government decides what 
healthcare Americans can access and 
what medications and procedures will 
be covered. 
Never mind the nearly 180 million 
Americans who have access to health 
insurance through their jobs, many of 
whom are satisfied with their coverage. 
No, that coverage would be decimated 
in favor of Democrats’ preferred ‘‘one 
size fits all’’ approach. I am not sure 
what Democrats have seen that makes 
them think government can efficiently 
run healthcare. Maybe they never had 
to deal with the IRS. 
Oh, and let’s not forget about the 
part where it has been projected that 
this government-run system could cost 
taxpayers more than $30 trillion. So 
what is the problem with that attitude 
the Democrats have? Why should all of 
us be concerned by the fact Democrats 
think 
the 
Federal 
Government—or 
maybe just the Democratic Party— 
knows best? 
For starters, it is clearly apparent 
that government does not always know 
best. Take our current inflation crisis. 
A big reason we are currently dealing 
with the worst inflation in 40 years is 
the Democrats’ decision to flood the 
economy with unnecessary government 
money with their American Rescue 
Plan spending spree. 
This legislation was billed as critical 
COVID relief that was going to help 
families and our economy recover. In-
stead, it helped plunge our economy 
into a massive inflation crisis that has 
left individuals and families struggling 
to afford necessities like gas and food. 
To give another example, the Presi-
dent’s Department of Homeland Secu-
rity 
recently 
created 
a 
so-called 
Disinformation Governance Board. And 
the individual who has been chosen to 
head up this disinformation board is 
someone who, herself, has been a pur-
veyor of online disinformation, as well 
as being hostile to what she apparently 
considers excessive free speech. Yet, 
apparently, the Biden administration 
thinks we should trust her to rule on 
disinformation. 
Of course, this is not to say that we 
should distrust every move the govern-
ment makes or whether the govern-
ment can never do anything good. As-
suming the government always knows 
best is to vastly overestimate the gov-
ernment’s abilities. The Federal Gov-
ernment, like society, is made up of 
flawed human beings. Being a Member 
of Congress or a Presidential adminis-
tration does not come anywhere close 
to conferring infallibility. 
Another big problem with ‘‘Demo-
crats’ knows best’’ attitude is it usu-
ally involves a plan for government to 
take over ever-greater areas of Amer-
ican life. More government control 
usually involves less individual free-
dom. 
Take the childcare plan Democrats 
included in their Build Back Better 
legislation. First, of course, Democrats 
take the opportunity to add a lot of 
new childcare mandates and regula-
tions. But more than that, Democrats’ 
government subsidy program is set up 
to favor certain kinds of childcare and 
childcare providers. It is set to favor 
institutional 
childcare 
rather 
than 
home care or other models, like neigh-
borhood co-ops. And it is set up to 
place religious providers at a disadvan-
tage. That is right. Despite the fact 
that more than half of working fami-
lies who use center-based care opt for 
faith-based centers, Democrats’ pro-
gram is set up to put these providers at 
a disadvantage. 
Democrats obviously think childcare 
is better conducted in secular, institu-
tional settings, so they set up their 
legislation 
to 
favor 
that 
kind 
of 
childcare, no matter—no matter—what 
parents actually prefer. 
That is pretty much par for the 
course for Democrats, of course, who 
have made it very clear that they have 
their doubts as to whether parents are 
the best decisionmakers for their chil-
dren. 
Who can forget the Democrat can-
didate for Governor of Virginia who 
memorably said: 
I’m not going to let parents come into 
schools and actually take books out and 
make their own decision . . . I don’t think 
parents should be telling schools what they 
should teach. 
This is a view that President Biden 
seemed to echo just days ago. I would 
love to hear the reasons why Demo-
crats think government can make bet-
ter decisions for children than parents 
who know their children as individuals 
and raise them and love them. 
But to get back to my main point 
here. The childcare program in Demo-
crats’ tax-and-spending spree is a per-
fect example of what happens when 
government starts taking over. The 
government, instead of the individual, 
starts making decisions. The more sub-
stantial the government involvement, 
the larger the government’s role in de-
cision making is likely to be. 
Again, that is not to say that the 
government has no role to play in 
American life. We need the Federal 
Government. Our national defense, for 
example, is most practically handled at 
the Federal level. But the Federal Gov-
ernment should be and is meant to be 
limited. 
And allowing the government to take 
over ever-larger aspects of American 
life—whether 
it 
is 
childcare, 
healthcare, or anything else—is a rec-
ipe for the loss of individual liberty. 
Finally, 
Democrats’ 
‘‘government 
knows best’’ attitude is a problem be-
cause, as we have clearly seen, it 
quickly leads to an attitude of ‘‘Demo-
crats know best,’’ which quickly leads 
to pushing for special privileges for 
Democrats. 
Take recent conflicts involving the 
Supreme Court. Democrats have made 
it abundantly clear that they believe 
the only legitimate Supreme Court is a 
Supreme Court that hands down deci-
sions in line with Democrats’ policy

preferences. And they haven’t just im-
plied this. More than one Democrat has 
actually straight-out called this Su-
preme Court illegitimate, despite the 
fact that every single Justice on the 
Supreme Court was duly nominated 
and confirmed in accordance with the 
Constitution of the United States. 
And the Senate, despite having the 
slimmest possible majority, in fact—a 
merely technical majority and abso-
lutely no mandate for radical change— 
Democrats have pushed to abolish the 
legislative 
filibuster 
so 
they 
can 
steamroll through far-left Democratic 
legislation, including a partisan take-
over of election law and, of course, the 
most extreme abortion legislation ever 
considered in Congress. 
Just imagine the howls that would 
have resulted if Republicans had an-
nounced that we were going to abolish 
the legislative filibuster to institute a 
20-week abortion ban—a ban that is 
much more in line with the sentiments 
of the majority of Americans than 
Democrats’ far-left abortion legisla-
tion. 
Or take the protests that have been 
going on at the Supreme Court Jus-
tices’ homes. The President and other 
Democrats have made it clear they are 
perfectly fine with demonstrators con-
gregating at the private homes of Su-
preme Court Justices to try and in-
timidate them into changing their 
vote. 
I have to ask, would Democrats be 
fine with pro-life activists appearing at 
the homes of Justice Breyer, Justice 
Kagan, and Justice Sotomayor to try 
to intimidate them into changing their 
votes? I think we all know the answer 
to that. But because abortion is one of 
Democrats’ pet issues, clearly, the 
usual rules don’t apply. ‘‘Government 
knows best’’ quickly becomes ‘‘Demo-
crats know best,’’ which leads to one 
rule for Democrats and one rule for ev-
eryone else. 
‘‘Government knows best’’ is not a 
vision Republicans share. We believe 
that individuals, not Washington bu-
reaucrats, are the best judges of what 
they and their family and children 
need. The government should be a 
backstop, not Big Brother. 
We also know the more government 
expands, the more individual liberty 
shrinks, which is why we are firmly 
committed to a philosophy of limited 
government. Our country is founded to 
safeguard individual liberty and pre-
serving that liberty it a sacred trust, 
which is why Republicans will continue 
to 
oppose 
Democrats’ 
‘‘Washington 
knows best,’’ Big Government philos-
ophy, and why we will continue to 
fight to make sure that Americans’ 
right to run their own lives and shape 
their own destinies is protected. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
NOMINATION OF MARY T. BOYLE 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, in a 
few moments, the Senate will vote on 
the confirmation of Mary Boyle to be a 
Commissioner of the Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission, CPSC. It ap-
pears that the Democratic leader, Sen-
ator SCHUMER, finally has the votes 
lined up for confirmation of Ms. Boyle 
and that she will be elevated to this po-
sition. I think this is a decision that 
Members of the Democratic Party and 
the administration will come to regret 
and Americans, in general, will come 
to regret. 
Recently, the Commerce Committee 
failed to report Ms. Boyle’s nomination 
favorably. All Democrats voted aye; all 
Republicans voted no. 
I think Members should understand 
this. CPSC plays a vital role in ensur-
ing the safety of American consumers. 
For this reason, I have significant con-
cerns about major administrative fail-
ures at the agency during Ms. Boyle’s 
tenure as Executive Director there, in-
cluding the improper disclosure of 
unredacted 
manufacturer 
and 
con-
sumer data. 
An investigation I led as chairman of 
the Commerce Committee last Con-
gress determined that the unauthorized 
release of this data, which violated sec-
tion 6(b) of the Consumer Product Safe-
ty Act, was the result of insufficient 
training, ineffective management, and 
poor information technology imple-
mentation. 
All of these failings at the CPSC were 
under Mary Boyle’s watch as the pri-
mary career official charged with the 
day-to-day administration of the Agen-
cy’s business, and yet today we are 
being asked to elevate her to an even 
more important and responsible posi-
tion at CPSC. 
I am also deeply troubled by the 
CPSC’s curtailing of port inspections 
for several months beginning with the 
pandemic and Ms. Boyle’s involvement 
in this decision. In addition, she pre-
sided over the deficient and prolonged 
process of fully returning CPSC staff to 
work at these ports. So the inspections 
were not getting done. There are now 
hundreds, if not thousands, of unsafe 
products that entered the country 
under Ms. Boyle’s watch, and we still 
lack a clear plan from the CPSC on 
how those dangerous products will be 
removed from the market. 
This nominee has failed to dem-
onstrate strong and effective leader-
ship in her current position as execu-
tive director of the CPSC. Yet the ad-
ministration and, apparently, the ma-
jority 
leader 
of 
the 
Senate 
are 
inexplicably trying to promote her to a 
higher position of trust and authority. 
In light of these many problems at 
the Agency associated with Ms. Boyle’s 
leadership, I think her confirmation 
will be a mistake, and I think my 
Democratic colleagues and the admin-
istration will come to regret this deci-
sion. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ARTISTS 
Mr. BOOKER. I rise not expecting to 
give a speech today, but I want to, first 
and foremost, recognize the Chair, who 
is my ‘‘mother’’ Senator, and I want to 
thank her for her incredible service to 
this institution. 
I want to thank, which I rarely do, 
the staff who works here and runs the 
Senate every day, but I rise today to 
talk for a moment about groups that 
we don’t talk about enough on this 
floor. We usually talk about everybody 
from law enforcement to our military, 
but we don’t talk about artists. 
We are a nation that even from our 
founding during Revolutionary times, 
there were extraordinary artists who 
expanded the moral imagination of this 
country and helped us to see a nation 
that could be free from British rule and 
domination. 
In every point of American history, 
from protest movements to battles for 
suffrage, we have had artists who have 
painted these pictures of an America, a 
vision for what could be, but even more 
than that, they have healed us during 
difficult times. They have pulled us to-
gether with their inspiration. They 
have called out injustices. They have 
brought light to the dark places of our 
country. 
You know, Picasso talked about art 
being something that helps to shake 
the dust off the soul of humanity, but 
I think it does more than that. As an 
African American, I have seen art in 
the tradition of healing, of providing 
hope, of even calling out with speci-
ficity the instructions on how to be 
free. 
We remember the song that Harriet 
Tubman pointed to: 
Wade in the water, wade in the water, God is 
going to trouble the water. 
That is the tradition that sourced my 
family. From enduring the pain of a 
nation that was unequal and divided, 
often in church with gospel songs, 
there was healing; there was hope. And 
even the poetry in the Harlem Renais-
sance spoke to an America that could 
possibly be if we just never stop believ-
ing. 
As the great poet Langston Hughes 
said: 
America never was America to me, 
[But] I swear this oath— 
America will be! 
Who made America, 
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and 
pain, 
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in 
the rain, 
Must [make] our . . . dream [live] again. 
O, yes, I say it plain, 
America never was America to me, 
And yet I swear this oath— 
America will be! 
I lean on poetry and song today just 
to get myself up in the morning. I have 
seen how artists have come to visit us 
here in the Capitol and Senators from

all backgrounds thanking them for pro-
viding for them the soundtrack of their 
lives. And God, humor, the comedians 
of old, I remember sneaking into bal-
conies—in my house—and watching 
over the balcony my dad, quietly not 
thinking his children were listening, 
put on records by Richard Pryor, whose 
humor helped to heal his troubled 
heart, make him laugh at the absurd-
ities of a nation that still had not fully 
fulfilled itself. 
And so I bring this thought and this 
heart to say thank you to artists, 
thank you to this institution for what 
we did in a bipartisan way to make 
sure we were funding the venues of this 
country, the stages where so many art-
ists were able to continue to work dur-
ing the pandemic. We fund the arts. It 
is funding that often has to be pushed 
or fought for, but I say it is the funding 
that in many ways helps to sustain and 
source the soul of a nation because 
without art, we would have lost our 
way a long time ago. 
Now, this week I had this moment 
where you have just got to pinch your-
self, and I know that the Presiding Of-
ficer has had this moment, too, where 
you get this call from White House 
staff, and they say: Hey, we have got 
some extra seats in the President of 
the United States’ box at the Kennedy 
Center to come see a performance by a 
group called Freestyle Love Supreme. 
And I said no immediately. I am so 
busy. I have got so much work. I had a 
night that was ending relatively early. 
But my staff said to me, you know, a 
guy, Chris Jackson—he was George 
Washington in ‘‘Hamilton’’—is going to 
be there as well, and I had gotten to 
know him because he was so generous. 
I saw him in ‘‘In The Heights.’’ He in-
vited me backstage, gave me such love. 
I saw him in ‘‘Hamilton.’’ Even when I 
had someone I was trying to date with 
me, he made me seem special in her 
eyes. I will never forget that. He was a 
good wingman. 
So I went to go see them perform, 
and I was just blown away by the per-
formance. I hope that while they are 
here, people get a chance to go. But 
what blew me away was how they re-
affirmed that message to me. At a time 
that I am troubled with what is hap-
pening in our life, with decisions in the 
Supreme Court, with challenges, with 
the economy, they touched on a lot of 
those issues with humor and artistic 
genius, and I found my spirit being lift-
ed. I found camaraderie with strangers. 
You see a whole crowd of people 
being pulled together around ideals of 
empathy and love and affirmation of 
our most core, cherished values as a 
nation, like freedom and protest. 
I am honored that this group is vis-
iting the U.S. Senate right now—for 
many, their first time being in this sa-
cred space, this hallowed Hall—to get a 
chance to witness what we do every 
day. 
And I just want to say thank you to 
them, and I want to give tribute to all 
of the artists in America who do so 
much for the soul of this Nation and 
inspire us every day not to stop believ-
ing in tomorrows that can be better 
than what we have in the present. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
NOMINATION OF MARY T. BOYLE 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I rise in support today of Mary Boyle, 
the nominee to serve as Commissioner 
at the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission. 
Mary will bring to this role more 
than a decade of experience on the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission, 
where she previously served as general 
counsel and currently serves as the Ex-
ecutive Director. She is deeply knowl-
edgeable about consumer product safe-
ty and the functioning of the CPSC. I 
have every confidence that she will be 
ready to lead on day one. 
But it is not just her professional 
background that makes her perfect for 
this role. As a mom who raised three 
kids, she knows firsthand how impor-
tant it is for parents to be able to trust 
the products they use every day. She 
understands the stakes and the dev-
astating consequences of unsafe prod-
ucts. 
Just yesterday, the Commerce Com-
mittee took an important step forward 
toward protecting kids and infants by 
passing the STURDY Act, which will 
prevent harmful and ultimately heart-
breaking furniture tip-overs. Senators 
CASEY
and BLUMENTHAL
and I have 
been working on this for quite a while. 
It resulted in the largest furniture re-
call ever in the history of America 
with IKEA. But we need standards in 
place across the board. I know that we 
can count on Mary to be another crit-
ical partner in preventing unsafe prod-
ucts from hurting our kids. 
Mary is clear-eyed about the respon-
sibility of the CPSC. In her words, it 
provides a safety net for the public, 
and in order to carry out that crucial 
task, it needs a full roster of Commis-
sioners. Currently, four of the five slots 
are filled. To truly address pressing 
product safety issues, we have to fill 
that fifth seat. We can’t afford to play 
politics here. This is about everything 
from the hazards posed by crib bumper 
pads to the use of toxic chemicals in 
everyday consumer products. 
I got involved in this way, way back 
before I was a Senator, when we had a 
young child swallow a charm that he 
got with a pair of tennis shoes. It was 
a giveaway. He didn’t die because he 
choked on that charm; he died over a 
period of days because the lead in that 
charm, which was from a foreign coun-
try, got into his system, and he died in 
just a few days. That is how I got in-
volved in the lead standards on foreign 
toys, that is how I started working 
with the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, and that is when I saw 
the difference it can make. 
We passed a bipartisan bill named 
after Jim Baker’s granddaughter—the 
Virginia Graeme Baker pool safety 
bill—after a young kid named Abigail 
Taylor in Minnesota was in a kiddy 
swimming pool and her intestines were 
ripped out just sitting in the pool be-
cause there were so many faulty drains 
in this country. 
I went and visited her in the hospital, 
and she said: I don’t want this to hap-
pen to any other kid. 
She lived for a year, and during that 
time, we worked together. 
Then Ted Stevens and I passed a 
much stronger pool safety bill. And I 
know that the last time I heard testi-
mony from the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, over a period of a 
decade, after we lost a number of kids 
every year, not one kid had died be-
cause of a simple change to how the 
pool drains worked. That is what the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission 
can do at its best—make sure it doesn’t 
happen to any other kid again. 
The American people are counting on 
us to get this right, and with Mary, we 
have the opportunity to do just that. 
As Mary said in her testimony, con-
sumers need to be able to go about 
their daily lives without worrying that 
products they interact with every 
day—washing machines, cell phones, 
batteries, toys, and treadmills, to 
name just a few—do not injure, maim, 
or kill them. Throughout her impres-
sive career, Mary Boyle has shown that 
she is wholeheartedly dedicated to that 
mission. 
I am voting in support of her, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1787. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, the 
State Antitrust Enforcement Venue 
Act is a much needed reform that 
would put State attorneys general 
bringing antitrust suits under the Fed-
eral antitrust law on equal footing 
alongside Federal antitrust enforce-
ment personnel by allowing them to 
avoid consolidation with private anti-
trust suits. 
This would shield these important 
antitrust actions from the inefficien-
cies of coordinating their litigation 
with their slower moving counterparts 
brought by private litigants, and it 
would also respect our federalist sys-
tem of government and recognize the 
unique and essential role that States 
play specifically in enforcing our anti-
trust laws. 
No doubt, this is exactly why this 
bill is supported by 45 State attorneys 
general, including Utah, Minnesota, Il-
linois, 
Iowa, 
Texas, 
California, 
Vermont, South Carolina, Rhode Is-
land, Delaware, Nebraska, Connecticut, 
Missouri, Hawaii, New Jersey, Arkan-
sas, Louisiana, and North Carolina, 
representing the home States of almost 
every member of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
My own reasons for introducing the 
legislation are simple. States are sov-
ereign entities, and they are entitled to

pursue law enforcement actions in de-
fense of their citizens in the venue and 
in the manner they think best, period. 
Allowing State antitrust enforce-
ment actions to be consolidated with 
private lawsuits not only impinges 
upon State sovereignty, it also need-
lessly delays consumer redress for anti-
trust harm. 
For example, the case brought by 16 
States in the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico alleging that Google’s conduct in 
digital advertising has violated Federal 
antitrust laws was transferred from 
Texas, where that lawsuit was origi-
nally filed, to the Southern District of 
New York to be consolidated with 
other cases. The transfer was ordered 
in August of last year. Some 9 months 
later, discovery is still stayed, and no 
progress has been made. Had the case 
just remained in Texas, discovery 
would be well underway, and the trial 
was scheduled for next summer. In-
stead, the case is languishing, and po-
tential remedies to consumer harm are 
being postponed. Google’s delay tactics 
have been successful. 
We must eliminate this loophole—a 
loophole that allows monopolists to 
delay antitrust enforcement actions 
brought by State attorneys general. I 
therefore urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. 
So, as in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 261, S. 1787. I fur-
ther ask that the Lee amendment at 
the desk be considered and agreed to; 
that the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, my friend 
and colleague Senator LEE
is well 
aware that I am supportive of this bill. 
We worked together. I am a lead Demo-
crat on this bill to get it through the 
committee. 
I simply believe that this bill must 
go hand in hand with another bill that 
would look at this issue in a much big-
ger way; that, yes, this is about allow-
ing State attorneys general to do their 
jobs and enforce the law, and that is 
why he and I have joined forces on this 
bill. But it is also about putting some 
rules of the road in place on a Federal 
basis. 
We are very close to having a vote on 
Senator GRASSLEY’s and my bill, with a 
broad range of authors and support, 
which would be the only and first Fed-
eral competition response to tech mo-
nopolies since the advent of the inter-
net. 
I have been watching this movie for 
way too long. We have hearings, we 
throw popcorn at CEOs, we get sound 
bites on TV, but we don’t do anything 
on 
a 
Federal 
basis. 
We 
had 
the 
Facebook whistleblower come forward, 
tell of the horror, the American people 
are with us, and we dither and do noth-
ing. This is actually the first time that 
we have a coalition across the aisle of 
people who are ready to move forward 
on a Federal response. 
So my view of this is that, as we 
work to get our enforcers more funds— 
that is a part of it; Senator GRASSLEY 
and I have a merger fee bill that is 
moving as part of the competition bill, 
which is currently in conference com-
mittee—and as we work on Senator 
LEE’s very worthy legislation to focus 
on allowing the State attorneys gen-
eral to keep their cases in their own ju-
risdictions, we simply cannot pretend 
that we don’t have some role in this. 
If Members don’t know about it, 
maybe they have talked to one of the 
2,700 lobbyists whom the tech compa-
nies have hired or maybe they have 
been subject to the $70 million effort on 
the Federal level. And this is not Sen-
ator LEE that I am talking about; he is 
a true maverick and is willing to take 
on special interests. But what I believe 
is going on in this building is that 
there are a lot of people trying to wait 
this one out and hope we don’t have a 
vote on this bill. 
I appreciate Senator SCHUMER work-
ing with me and leadership on the 
Democratic and Republican sides of the 
Judiciary Committee to make sure 
that we get this vote. 
So Senator LEE will have a vote on 
this bill. I would certainly not concede 
at this moment giving tech something 
they want in this bill when we can’t 
even have a vote on the Federal legis-
lation, but we will have a vote on Sen-
ator LEE’s bill. I just believe they have 
to go hand in hand. 
I think he is well aware of Senators 
doing all kinds of things procedurally 
to be able to get votes, but I think it is 
really important that we don’t have a 
State-only approach when it comes to 
what is going on with tech. 
To again remind my colleagues and 
those watching this, what our bill— 
this big, bipartisan, important bill— 
does, it doesn’t tear apart the com-
pany. It doesn’t even take on the fact 
that they are all monopolies—and they 
are monopolies. Google has a 90-per-
cent market share. Apple and Google 
basically, when it comes to app stores, 
are duopolies in dominating the mar-
ket. 
While Europe is set to vote on their 
own digital market bill on Monday and 
move this ahead—I was just speaking 
with them—while Australia has taken 
on the issue of the news organizations, 
while Great Britain is moving ahead, 
we sit back. It is time to at least take 
on one issue. 
As the Justice Department looks at 
what is a monopoly, is it a monopoly 
when you have 90 percent market 
share? The very least we can do is put 
some rules of the road in place. 
What Senator GRASSLEY’s and my 
bill does—and we have taken several 
comments from Members and made 
changes to that bill—what the bill sim-
ply does is it says: Hey, monopolies or 
gatekeeper companies, if you own your 
own companies—which they are in-
creasingly doing—you can’t use your 
monopoly 
status 
to 
self-preference 
your own products in front of other 
products. 
No. 2, you can’t copy nonpublic data 
that you have because of the virtue of 
the fact that you are the gatekeeper 
and then rip it off and make your own 
products. That is exactly what Amazon 
did, as the Wall Street Journal re-
ported, with a four-employee luggage 
organizer firm when they gave them 
the data. The next thing you know, it 
shows up on Amazon Basics. 
The third thing you can’t do is make 
companies, small businesses, buy a 
bunch of stuff just to put yourself at 
the top of the platform. 
The American people are with us on 
this, poll after poll, including a poll 
that 
Google 
accidentally—acciden-
tally—put out there before they were 
able to pull it back that showed 68 per-
cent of people want to use the anti-
trust laws—68 percent of people in 
their own polling—to be able to rein in 
this problem. 
This is a uniquely American ap-
proach, but it must be done hand in 
hand with State enforcement. 
So, all I am asking my friend and col-
league to do here—and we wouldn’t be 
here if we could have reached an agree-
ment on this—is, I will assure him that 
we will have a vote on his bill; but we 
must also have a vote and finally move 
ahead on what is only a slice of what 
we could be doing. 
We are not doing some of the things 
I would want to do, which is look back 
at some of these mergers, which is ac-
tually take that email that Mark 
Zuckerberg wrote that said I’d rather 
‘‘buy than compete’’ and look at what 
they bought in their zest to be able to 
avoid competition. Right now, that is 
going on with the Justice Department 
and the FTC. But we are simply trying 
to set some rules of the road, and it is 
more than overdue after an 8-month in-
vestigation in the House of Representa-
tives—an 8-month investigation. 
What Federal bills have we passed 
that would put any checks and bal-
ances on these companies? They just 
keep getting bigger and bigger and big-
ger. And I am so pleased that some of 
the State attorneys general are taking 
this on. 
I am eager to get Senator LEE’s bill 
and my bill up for a vote, but it will 
come close to when the vote on the ac-
tual Federal rules takes place. For 
these reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I appre-
ciate the insight and the enthusiasm 
for antitrust law and even for this leg-
islation that has been expressed by my 
friend and distinguished colleague, the 
Senator from Minnesota. She and I 
have been partners on a number of 
things, including the fact that we have 
alternated back and forth as the chair

and ranking member of the Antitrust 
Subcommittee in the Senate for over a 
decade now. 
As she mentioned, she is the lead co-
sponsor with me on this bill. We have 
worked together on it. 
Look: I agree completely that we 
need to hold Big Tech accountable 
under antitrust laws. If you want to 
hold Big Tech accountable, pass this 
bill. Pass this bill today. There is not a 
reason to delay. 
No, I understand and appreciate her 
desire to pass the Klobuchar-Grassley 
bill. I get that. It is a different pro-
posal. It is not inconsistent with this 
one. There is no reason why this one 
couldn’t pass and still allow the other 
one to move forward, nor is there any 
reason why this measure becoming law 
would, in any way, undermine that leg-
islation or that legislative proposal. 
As to reaching a deal or not reaching 
a deal, we have been in conversations 
with the office of Senator KLOBUCHAR 
for months—literally, months—about 
it. We talked about different strategies 
for making sure that we could get it 
passed—what might have to change. 
We both discussed the fact that we pre-
ferred to keep the bill intact with the 
retroactivity provisions in there, but, 
if necessary, we could remove the 
retroactivity provisions if, by so doing, 
we could get it past the hotline. All of 
that has been done in consultation 
with the office of the Senator from 
Minnesota 
for 
months—literally 
months. So none of this is a surprise. 
This was done in tandem with Senator 
KLOBUCHAR’s office. 
Finally, I feel the need to push back 
against 
the 
notion 
that 
whenever 
something bigger could happen, noth-
ing smaller in that area may be al-
lowed to pass prior to that. This is a 
discreet, very specific fix to antitrust 
law that is desperately needed—ur-
gently needed in order to hold Big Tech 
accountable under our antitrust laws. 
There is no good reason to delay this, 
and it is unfortunate today that we 
can’t do that. I least expected it from 
the lead cosponsor of the legislation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Again, I look for-
ward to working with Senator LEE to 
pass this bill, and I also look forward 
to passing a bill on the Federal basis 
and not just deciding that this should 
be in the province of 50 different 
States, and I thoroughly plan to work 
with him to pass this bill, and I hope it 
will be soon. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 631 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I rise 
today out of a desire to protect the 
rights and the health of the young men 
and women who serve the Senate as 
pages. 
I think we could all agree that the 
Senate wouldn’t function well without 
pages. The very first Senate page was a 
9-year-old boy named Grafton Hanson. 
He was appointed by Daniel Webster in 
1829. In those days, the pages’ jobs were 
to refill the inkwells and clean out 
spittoons. Fortunately, things have im-
proved a bit for the pages. The work 
isn’t quite as messy anymore, but it is 
still a high-pressure job for a high 
school student. 
When I was here on the floor voting 
last week, I noticed that the pages 
were all wearing masks, but none of 
my colleagues were. I threatened to 
come to the floor to seek unanimous 
consent to end the mask mandate, and 
the next day, the mandate ended. Coin-
cidence? Perhaps. 
The new policy states, though, that 
the mask-wearing will become optional 
for pages who test negative. But once 
again, we see the masks on the floor. 
I urge my colleagues to look around. 
The pages are still wearing masks. The 
COVID policy for the Senate pages re-
quires the reinstitution of a mask man-
date if they have supposedly been ex-
posed. 
Apparently, there are rules for the 
pages of the Senate, but not for the 
President of the Senate, KAMALA HAR-
RIS. When Vice President HARRIS was 
deemed potentially exposed to COVID, 
she not only presided over the Senate’s 
confirmation vote of Justice Ketanji 
Brown Jackson, but was also seen at 
the White House with the President, 
the First Lady, and the Justice with-
out a mask. Rules for thee but not for 
me. 
Jen Psaki justified the Vice Presi-
dent’s violation of the COVID guide-
lines by stating that it was an emo-
tional day. I guess if you are feeling 
like it is an emotional day then you 
can do what you please, unless you are 
a page. The impressive thing about 
that absurd defense was that Psaki was 
able to say it with a straight—and 
maskless—face. 
But an unseasoned mask mandate is 
not all that is required of the pages. 
According to the guidelines: ‘‘All pages 
are required to be fully vaccinated; if 
their initial vaccination series was 
completed at least five months ago, 
pages are required to obtain [a] booster 
[shot]’’ to participate in the Page Pro-
gram. 
From day one, our country’s response 
to this pandemic has made the com-
fortable more comfortable, while the 
working class or kids or people with no 
power have to keep on working but 
have to obey rules that the adults 
don’t have to themselves. 
Now in the halls of Congress we have 
created a privileged class that can 
choose whether to get vaccinated and 
an underclass that has to abide by dic-
tate. It makes absolutely no sense to 
mandate COVID vaccinations for teen-
agers who are healthy. It makes even 
less sense to mandate a booster. There 
is no scientific evidence that boosters 
are valuable, and there is scientific evi-
dence that boosters increase the risk of 
a heart inflammation for young adoles-
cent males. 
A study published last month in the 
Journal of the American Medical Asso-
ciation Cardiology examined over 23 
million people ages 12 and up across 
Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Swe-
den. It concluded that the risk of myo-
carditis, an inflation of the heart, ‘‘was 
more 
pronounced’’ 
after 
a 
second 
mRNA vaccine dose, ‘‘and the risk was 
highest among males aged 16 to 24 
years.’’ 
This is exactly why several European 
countries, including Germany, France, 
Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Nor-
way, all restrict the use of mRNA vac-
cines for COVID—particularly for ado-
lescents, particularly for adolescent 
males. The policy of our pages does not 
address this issue at all and blindly 
commands boosters. 
In fact, if you read the policy, you 
could imagine an endless stream of 
boosters. Every 5 months that you 
haven’t had another vaccine you would 
be required to get a booster. 
Last fall, the director and deputy di-
rector at the FDA’s Office of Vaccines 
Research and Review both resigned. 
Realize who these people are. They are 
on the vaccine committee. They are 
pro-vaccine. Both of them are actually 
pro-vaccine mandate. Yet, they re-
signed from the Government, as re-
ported, ‘‘citing White House pressure 
to approve third doses for all adults 
and writing damning op-ed’s critical of 
the FDA’s subsequent decision to do 
so.’’ 
It became a political decision. The 
committee voted against extending 
boosters to kids, and then it was over-
ruled by politicians at the White 
House. These two researchers, long es-
teemed, who have been on this com-
mittee for years, resigned in protest. 
One of the op-eds that ran in the 
Washington Post was coauthored by 
Dr. Paul Offitt, a professor of pediat-
rics and director of the Vaccine Edu-
cation Center at Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia. 
Once again—not an opponent of vac-
cines; a proponent of vaccines, a guy 
who has been on the vaccine committee 
for decades. 
As a Member of the FDA’s advisory 
committee, Dr. Offitt, though, did not 
support widespread boosting when the 
committee met to consider boosters for 
all adults in September and October. 
He and the two former FDA officials 
wrote: ‘‘A healthy young person with 
two mRNA doses is extremely unlikely 
to be hospitalized with COVID, so the 
case for risking any side effects,’’ the 
case for forcing them to take a third 
vaccine when their risk of COVID after 
two vaccines is nearly, if not virtually, 
zero, he says—or they said that the 
case for risking any side effects—such 
as 
myocarditis—diminishes 
substan-
tially.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2474 
May 12, 2022 
What happens is myocarditis is a rare 
event for vaccines, more common with 
young adolescent males. But you have 
to compare the risk of getting myocar-
ditis with the vaccine to the risk of the 
disease. Young people who have been 
vaccinated twice—even without vac-
cines, young people, the death rate 
under 15 is 1 in 2.32 million. With the 
vaccine it is probably zero. We have 
studies of millions of people. We can’t 
find kids that are dying or going to the 
hospital with two vaccines. And yet 
the policy for pages in this body is a 
booster—a mandated booster. It is ac-
tually malpractice. It is malpractice to 
give a booster, a third vaccine, to an 
adolescent male and probably to an ad-
olescent female. There is no evidence it 
helps them. 
Then the other argument goes like 
this: Oh, we don’t want them to trans-
mit it to people. Guess what? We have 
done a study on that, too. Vaccinated 
versus unvaccinated: 25 percent of the 
household will transmit it. It is the 
same for both groups. The vaccine pro-
tects you from hospitalization and 
death. It does not prevent trans-
mission. 
So we are going to vaccinate these 
kids to take care of the old folks in the 
Senate. It is not true. And they have 
already been vaccinated twice. The 
third vaccine—there is no scientific 
evidence. There is, however, evidence 
that it is a danger to them. And to ig-
nore that danger, to be supportive of 
force I think is without question the 
wrong way to go. 
In January, a piece in The Atlantic 
cited Dr. Offitt—once again, a vaccine 
supporter who has been part of the vac-
cine committee with the FDA for dec-
ades—as saying this: 
Getting boosted would not be worth the 
risk for the average healthy 17-year-old boy. 
This is coming from an advocate of 
vaccines—not a denier, not someone 
who hasn’t been vaccinated. His son 
has been vaccinated, I believe, twice. 
But he said he wouldn’t do it for a 17- 
year-old. In fact, he advised his son 
publicly, who is in his early 20s, not to 
get the third dose. 
What if I am wrong? What if Dr. 
Offitt is wrong? I don’t know. What if 
it is a controversy? Wouldn’t we allow 
it, maybe, in a free society, up to free 
individuals consulting with their par-
ents whether you want to get them? 
But, no. Everything is about force. Ev-
erything is about mandates. Do as I am 
told, even when the science doesn’t 
support it—even when the science is ar-
guable. Do it or we will fire you. Do it 
or we will send you home. I think it is 
a terrible example and, coming from 
the Senate, an awful precedent. 
The Chicago Thinker is a paper for 
the University of Chicago, and the stu-
dents there put it in a January 11 edi-
torial. These are the kids who are 
being forced to do boosters as well: 
If being ‘‘boosted’’ becomes a prerequisite 
for participation in normal life, the vaccine’s 
diminishing efficacy means the booster cam-
paign will never end. 
See, we know this. This is the truth 
of the matter. While the vaccine does 
help you to prevent hospitalization and 
death, we know it has diminishing effi-
cacy, meaning that it wears off, so you 
have to keep getting boosted and 
boosted and boosted. But shouldn’t we 
at least study it? Shouldn’t we be hon-
est with these kids in that their death 
rate is virtually zero with nothing? If 
you vaccinate them, it is zero, and 
then we have just got to keep vacci-
nating them. Just do as you are told. 
Submit to the State. Do whatever peo-
ple tell you despite the science; despite 
three scientists from the FDA’s vac-
cine committee saying it is not war-
ranted; despite people arguing that it 
is actually malpractice and puts these 
young people at risk to make them get 
a third vaccine. 
In December, Dr. Marty Makary, a 
professor at the Johns Hopkins School 
of Medicine, wrote in the Wall Street 
Journal: 
The U.S. government is pushing Covid-19 
vaccine boosters for 16- and 17-year-olds 
without supporting clinical data. A large 
Israeli population study, published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine earlier 
this month, found that the risk of COVID 
death in people under 30 with two vaccine 
shots was zero. 
The risk of death is zero, and we are 
forcing them to get a third shot for 
which we know, from large, million- 
person studies, there is a side effect of 
heart inflammation. 
Even 
World 
Health 
Organization 
Chief 
Scientist 
Dr. 
Soumya 
Swaminathan said in January that 
there is no evidence right now that 
suggests healthy children and adoles-
cents need booster shots. 
So most of Europe has actually said 
don’t take it because of the risk of my-
ocarditis, and the head of the WHO 
says there is no health reason for 
which to do it. Yet the Senate thinks it 
is smart enough to mandate these kids. 
God forbid one of them dies. God forbid 
one of them gets myocarditis. 
Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiolo-
gist from Harvard Medical School, says 
that mandating people who have al-
ready had COVID to still get vac-
cinated ‘‘makes zero sense from a sci-
entific point of view, and it makes zero 
sense from a public health point of 
view.’’ 
Furthermore, we now know the CDC 
released that, under age 11, 75 percent 
of the kids have already had it. So, in 
the age category of the pages and a lit-
tle older than that, we are looking at a 
70- to 75-percent chance they have al-
ready had it; they have already been 
vaccinated; their chance of death is 
zero. Yet it is not enough. They must 
submit—submit to the man; submit to 
the woman; submit to the State. 
The science isn’t there. It is all about 
submission. 
Then we have weak lapdogs who just 
say: Go ahead and force them. We don’t 
care. It is not very likely they will die. 
It is only a few out of 100,000 we may 
lose. 
A study in The Lancet last Sep-
tember supported this view, stating: 
Current evidence does not . . . appear to 
show a need for boosting in the general popu-
lation. 
This is not just in kids. This is in The 
Lancet, saying there isn’t evidence for 
boosting in the general population. 
What has been accepted by most peo-
ple is that boosting for those at risk— 
those of age, those with obesity, those 
with, you know, other risk factors—is 
not an unreasonable thing. For most of 
the people our age and older, the vac-
cine, without question, is safer than 
the disease, but the disease is so rare, 
so uneventful, and the death rate so 
low in children that you need a near- 
perfect vaccine to say: Take the vac-
cine versus the disease. 
Even then, wouldn’t you want to 
know if they had had it? Wouldn’t we 
want the CDC to release, if you have 
had COVID or if you have had COVID 
and have been vaccinated, what your 
chances are of going to the hospital? 
They actually did look at this for a 
large population study, and they found 
that, if you were vaccinated versus 
unvaccinated, you were 20 times less 
likely to go to the hospital. I still be-
lieve that to be true, and I think it is 
for the overall population. It is prob-
ably not measurable for kids because 
kids aren’t largely affected by this. 
Do you know what they also meas-
ured? They measured unvaccinated 
versus the unvaccinated who have had 
COVID—and guess what. You were 55 
times less likely to go to the hospital. 
The disease is an incredibly potent 
source of immunity. If you have been 
vaccinated and had the disease, I think 
you would calculate that in. 
Do you just blindly submit and just 
take 100 vaccines and take it every 6 
months or would you want to talk to 
your doctor and say: Well, I had COVID 
in January, and I have had two vac-
cines. I am relatively thin and rel-
atively healthy. What do you think? 
Wouldn’t there be a decision-making 
process? 
When we are talking to children—the 
young men and women at the ages of 15 
and 16 years old, many of whom have 
had COVID already and have already 
had vaccines—wouldn’t we want them 
to be part of the decision making? 
Wouldn’t we say: What do your par-
ents think? 
Wouldn’t we ask for parental con-
sent? 
This is insane what we are doing. We 
have taken off on a tangent where 
things that were once private decisions 
are now the realm of the State. 
In the study in The Lancet, they 
stated that the ‘‘[c]urrent evidence 
does not . . . appear to show a need for 
boosting in the general population, in 
which efficacy against severe disease 
remains high,’’ and ‘‘currently avail-
able evidence’’—this is also from The 
Lancet—‘‘does not show the need for 
widespread use of booster vaccination 
in populations that have received an ef-
fective primary regimen.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2475 
May 12, 2022 
So here we have a not insubstantial 
journal, The Lancet. Now, you can dis-
agree. You can disagree with the New 
England Journal of Medicine. You can 
disagree with The Lancet, but for good-
ness’ sake, wouldn’t you at least admit 
that it is an argument and that when 
there is an argument that has valid 
facts on both sides of it that maybe the 
individual ought to get to decide? 
The Lancet says: 
Currently available evidence does not show 
the need for widespread booster vaccination 
in populations that have received an effec-
tive primary vaccination regimen. 
There is absolutely no clinical data 
to support other than a bunch of bu-
reaucrats who want to command you. 
There is no clinical data to say that 15- 
and 16-year-olds ought to get a boost-
er—zero. 
When we consider the rules for pages, 
we ought to ask: Will these policies be 
expected to continue indefinitely? And, 
if so, to what end? based on what data? 
When will they change? 
We have got them in here wearing 
masks. The Vice President doesn’t 
wear a mask when she is exposed. Look 
across all the pages of the news. Every-
body has been exposed. I think we have 
had 8 to 10 Senators who have had 
COVID in the last couple of weeks. Do 
you think everybody who ran into 
them wore a mask for 2 weeks? No, no-
body is doing it. Nobody is paying any 
attention to these people, but the 
pages are stuck under the thumb of 
these public health czars. 
When we consider the rules, we ought 
to ask: When will this end? 
When it comes to vaccines, though, 
they can benefit the vaccinated person, 
but it doesn’t stop transmission. The 
best data we have comes from Den-
mark, where vaccines were not shown 
to have any impact on household viral 
transmission or the secondary attack 
rate. In other words, whether vac-
cinated or unvaccinated, they both 
transmitted the disease equally. 
It is no coincidence that the Scan-
dinavian countries have moved on to a 
targeted testing and treatment regime. 
They are no longer just saying for ev-
erybody to submit and for everybody to 
do the same thing. They are targeting 
the disease and those who are at risk. 
They don’t expect people to live in a 
state of constant fear under an endless 
public health emergency. Instead, pub-
lic health officials issue recommenda-
tions about how those at risk can pro-
tect themselves. They give advice. 
There was a time in the history of 
our country when public health offi-
cials gave advice, not dictates or man-
dates. Realize the policy we are adher-
ing to is the same policy that Dr. Fauci 
espouses, and you know what his re-
sponse was. 
When the court struck down the 
mask mandate on planes, do you know 
what Dr. Fauci had the audacity to 
say? He said: How dare the courts in-
volve themselves in public health. We 
are not smart enough. Nobody outside 
the realm of Dr. Fauci is smart enough, 
but how dare the courts or the Con-
stitution adjudicate what is individual 
liberty, what is the responsibility of 
government, and whether the CDC has 
the power to have mask mandates— 
none of this. 
How dare they? That was his re-
sponse. 
Some offered a different approach. 
Some offered a more targeted approach 
to this. It is what Dr. Scott Atlas 
called for when he was at the White 
House in the last administration, but 
his voice was deliberately drowned out 
by Dr. Fauci and others who attempted 
to govern by stick rather than carrot. 
Public health measures should be 
backed up with proof that the benefits 
outweigh the burdens. There is no evi-
dence of that when it comes to vaccina-
tion mandates, especially for teen-
agers, who as a group are less vulner-
able to this virus than any Senator. 
That is why I am asking unanimous 
consent that the Senate pass my reso-
lution to end all COVID mandates for 
pages and respect their privacy, their 
rights, their medical freedom, and 
their health for the young men and 
women who serve in this Chamber. 
Madam President, as in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 631, which is at the desk. I fur-
ther ask that the resolution be agreed 
to and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, in re-
serving the right to object, my col-
league Senator PAUL is well-intended 
in this recommendation, and I listened 
to it carefully, as I am sure others did. 
The Page Program, which has been in 
effect since 1829, has become a program 
of both opportunity and education and 
is a program that the Page Board, the 
Senate Page Board, has responsibility 
for. 
I would say, in looking at the imme-
diate future, the pages who are here 
now, the pages who have agreed to be 
pages in the summer, and the pages, I 
think, who are in line to be pages in 
the fall—and their families—have all 
looked 
at 
these 
recommendations. 
They have all decided they are rec-
ommendations they would be able to 
meet. Maybe more importantly, they 
also have decided to make that family 
decision for their children to be here 
and be pages as high school juniors, 
perhaps, because of the standards that 
have been set that they are well aware 
of. 
I would hope that Senator PAUL 
would continue to talk to the Page 
Board. I think the Page Board has a 
very important job to do. They accept 
an incredible responsibility of the rela-
tionships that they have decided to 
enter into between the pages, their 
families, and the Page Board in rep-
resenting the Senate. 
That Board has some oversight from 
the Rules Committee, and I yield to 
the chairman of the Rules Committee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I thank Senator BLUNT for his state-
ment. 
I join him in opposing this resolu-
tion. 
As chair of the Rules Committee, 
with oversight of the Sergeant at Arms 
who helps manage the Senate Page 
Program, I know, like Senator BLUNT 
does and everyone here does—I see Sen-
ator LEAHY is here, the Presiding Offi-
cer, and Senator PAUL—how hard the 
dedicated pages, who come from States 
across the country, work to help us do 
our jobs here on the Senate floor. We 
are so excited when we have someone 
from our States come and join us as a 
page. They are, too, as are their fami-
lies. 
As we continue to reopen the Capitol, 
which I strongly support, we must also 
take into account the health and safe-
ty of everyone who works and visits 
here, including our pages. This resolu-
tion would reverse the Page Pro-
gram’s—as Senator BLUNT noted—cur-
rent policy and prohibit any require-
ment 
for 
pages 
to 
be 
vaccinated 
against COVID–19. 
It would also prohibit requiring pages 
to undergo COVID testing or wear a 
mask regardless of guidance from the 
Office of the Attending Physician or 
the CDC. This includes reversing the 
policy that all pages must wear a mask 
if one tests positive—a commonplace 
rule to protect healthy pages, who all 
live in the same dormitory, which, I 
think, is the defining part of this. 
In light of recent events, we know 
that staff, Senators, as well as pages, 
have tested positive in the past few 
weeks. In light of these recent events, 
the Attending Physician, Dr. Monahan, 
has recommended that all pages wear 
masks. I believe in science. I believe we 
should listen to Dr. Monahan. Local 
public health officials have also de-
cided, by the way, to require vaccines 
for certain eligible students in Wash-
ington, DC, including those attending 
our page school here in the Senate. 
I agree with Senator BLUNT in that 
the Page Program needs flexibility to 
set its own policies to protect the 
health and safety of pages. We should 
not put these young people who have 
come here to work in the heart of our 
democracy at risk unnecessarily. 
We all know that the vaccine helps 
greatly if someone gets sick. I know 
that because my husband got really 
sick before there was a vaccine. He is 
healthy, and he ended up in the hos-
pital for a week on oxygen. That might 
shape my response here, but I believe 
that if he had had the vaccine, we 
wouldn’t have come that close to los-
ing him. 
I believe in science. And so I join 
Senator BLUNT in this objection. And 
we look forward to seeing these pages 
and many pages serve us well in the 
coming years; therefore, I object.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
complete my remarks, which will be 
brief. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE NOMINATIONS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, since 
President Biden took office, we have 
made tremendous economic progress as 
a country. Our economic growth last 
year exceeded that of China’s for the 
first time in 20 years, and Federal Re-
serve nominees who have come before 
the Senate are crucial to continuing 
that progress. As Americans face rising 
prices caused by corporate greed, a 
global pandemic, and Putin’s war, hav-
ing a full Federal Reserve Board has 
never been more vital. 
A few weeks ago, the Senate con-
firmed Lael Brainard to be Vice Chair 
of the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral 
Reserve 
System. 
Vice 
Chair 
Brainard has served as a member of the 
Federal Reserve since 2014, when she 
led bipartisan action to support fami-
lies through the COVID–19 economic 
crisis and worked to create a better 
payments system that works for con-
sumers and small banks. She has cham-
pioned 
efforts 
to 
modernize 
and 
strengthen the Community Reinvest-
ment Act, a landmark civil rights law 
to start to undo the dark legacy 
brought on by Jim Crow and, ulti-
mately, redlining. We saw her tremen-
dous efforts pay off. Last week, all 
three Federal banking Agencies moved 
forward with their new, historic CRA 
proposal. 
Earlier this week, Democrats sup-
ported the historic nomination of Dr. 
Lisa Cook, who is a prominent econo-
mist with years of research and inter-
national experience on monetary pol-
icy, banking, and financial crises. She 
is the first Black woman to serve on 
the Board of Governors in the 109-year 
history of the Federal Reserve. She has 
seen how economic policy affects all 
kinds of people in different parts of the 
country, from the rural South where 
she grew up in Milledgeville, GA, to the 
industrial Midwest at Michigan State 
University—one 
of 
the 
great 
Mid-
western State universities of this coun-
try—where she built her career. 
Dr. Cook is a Spelman College alum-
na. She was a Marshall Scholar and a 
Truman Scholar. She studied at Oxford 
University. She earned her Ph.D. in ec-
onomics at Berkeley. She is a tenured 
professor 
of 
economics 
and 
inter-
national relations at Michigan State. 
Last night, the Senate confirmed Dr. 
Philip Jefferson, one of the country’s 
leading thinkers on the economics of 
poverty. He will be a critical voice on 
the Fed. He is the vice president for 
academic affairs, dean of faculty, and 
Freeland professor of economics at Da-
vidson College. He began his career as 
a Fed economist. He grew up, as he

says, in the shadow of RFK Stadium in 
the Southeast part of this city. He 
served as chair of the economics de-
partment at Swarthmore College, my 
daughter Emily’s alma mater. Dr. Jef-
ferson would be only the fourth Black 
man to serve as a Fed Governor. 
Both Dr. Jefferson and Dr. Cook will 
bring important perspectives on pov-
erty, inequality, and racial equity to 
the Fed—perspectives that have been 
missing for most of the last 109 years. 
Today, we will vote on Jerome Pow-
ell, who has earned the opportunity— 
earned the opportunity—to lead the 
Fed as Chair for another term. He has 
been a steadfast defender of the Fed-
eral Reserve’s independence, resisting 
unprecedented attacks by former Presi-
dent Trump to politicize the Fed. I 
know he will similarly resist those in 
Congress who see inflation not as a 
burden on American families but as a 
chance to blame the President of the 
United States for something that is 
complex due chiefly to things that hap-
pened before he was President and 
mainly to corporate greed and global 
events. Along with now-Vice Chair 
Brainard, he played an instrumental 
role in stabilizing our economy in the 
face of the coronavirus pandemic. He 
has been a reliable voice and a steady 
hand through this crisis. 
All of the nominees for the Fed have 
received an unprecedented amount of 
support from across the political spec-
trum—more letters of endorsement 
than I have ever seen for Federal Re-
serve nominees—from State regulators, 
economists, bankers, and former gov-
ernment officials, consumer groups, 
civil rights advocates, and on and on 
and on. 
I congratulate Vice Chair Brainard 
and Governor Cook and Governor Jef-
ferson on their nominations and con-
firmations. I urge my colleagues to 
vote to confirm Chair Powell. 
Last point. I will continue to work 
with my colleagues to round out the 
full complement of the Federal Re-
serve—it has not had a full seven mem-
bers in almost a decade—when we con-
firm in a few weeks the Vice Chair of 
Supervision nominee, Michael Barr. 
The Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-
fairs Committee will hold a hearing on 
Mr. Barr’s nomination next week. We 
will move swiftly to vote. 
I urge my colleagues to support Chair 
Powell today and to support Mr. Barr’s 
nomination as Vice Chair soon. 
I am confident all of the President’s 
nominees will fiercely guard the Fed’s 
independence and will work to bring 
down prices and, most importantly, put 
workers and families at the center of 
our economic policy. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON POWELL NOMINATION 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2340 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today and will, in 
short order, seek unanimous consent 
for the passage of the Daniel Anderl 
Judicial Security and Privacy Act of 
2021. This bill, which was reported out 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee 
last December with overwhelming bi-
partisan support, is named after Daniel 
Anderl, the 20-year-old son of U.S. Dis-
trict Court Judge Esther Salas. 
Mr. President, 1 year 9 months 23 
days ago, Daniel was brutally mur-
dered by a gunman who targeted Judge 
Salas for her gender, her ethnicity, and 
because he could not accept a judgment 
in a case that she reached in her court. 
To carry out his horrific hate crime, 
the gunman used publicly available in-
formation, tracking down Judge Salas 
to her home in New Jersey and mur-
dering Daniel in cold blood when he an-
swered the door. And after that, her 
husband Mark also was shot and seri-
ously wounded. 
Every single day since July 19, 2020, 
Judge Salas and her husband Mark 
have been dealing with the immense 
grief of burying their only son. No par-
ent should have to experience such a 
devastating loss. Yet, in the face of so 
much pain, Judge Salas has channeled 
it into purpose, embarking on a per-
sonal mission to increase the safety 
and privacy of her fellow judges and 
their families. 
Now, I know Judge Salas well. Back 
in 2010, I was proud to recommend her 
to the Federal bench. A year later, 
when the Senate unanimously con-
firmed her by voice vote, she became 
the first Latina to serve on the district 
court of New Jersey. 
After the horrific tragedy she suf-
fered, I made a personal commitment 
to honor Daniel’s legacy through ac-
tion. I told her I would not rest until 
we enacted greater protections for 
those who serve on the Federal bench 
to prevent another judge from having 
to endure the senseless violence Judge 
Salas experienced. 
The bipartisan bill I seek unanimous 
consent for is an effort I am proud to 
lead with 12 of my colleagues, includ-
ing Senators DURBIN, GRASSLEY, BOOK-
ER, GRAHAM
and KENNEDY. Our bill 
would 
prevent 
potential 
assailants 
from using publicly available informa-
tion to target judges or their families. 
It is a commonsense measure that 
would authorize the U.S. Marshal Serv-
ice to monitor online threats and deter 
future attacks. 
It is so common sense that it was 
voted out of the Judiciary Committee 
with strong bipartisan support—I am 
talking about a 21-to-0 vote in the af-
firmative. 
It is so common sense, in fact, that 
just, I think, 2 days ago my Republican 
colleagues led a similar measure to 
safeguard Supreme Court Justices and 
their families. 
So if the Senate passed an important 
bill without hearings—without hear-
ings—directly to the floor to support 
and protect Supreme Court Justices 
and their families, I think we should do 
it as well for Federal judges. Nobody 
made an effort to change that bill. 
There is simply no explanation or 
justification to protect Supreme Court 
Justices while delaying legislation to 
protect Federal judges who face the 
same, if not greater, risk. 
No judge in America should have to 
fear for their lives as they work to up-
hold our Constitution, our democracy, 
and ensure all people have equal jus-
tice under the law. 
Every day that we delay in passing 
this critical legislation is a day that 
we delay necessary protections for the 
guardians of our Constitution and the 
rule of law. 
There are three branches of our gov-
ernment. One of the essential ones is 
the judiciary. They make decisions

May 12, 2022 
every day about what is the law of the 
land and what is the answer to disputes 
among us as individuals and entities. If 
that judge is fearful that their deci-
sions at the end of the day will lead to 
violence against them and their fami-
lies, how long will their judgment not 
be affected and, therefore, how long 
will we as a nation be able to say that 
the rule of law is truly in place? 
So I ask my Senate colleagues to join 
me today in honoring the life and 
memory of Daniel Anderl. Let us do 
the right thing and unanimously pass 
the Judicial Security and Privacy Act 
of 2021 named after him. 
So, as in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 190, S. 2340; fur-
ther, that the committee-reported sub-
stitute amendment be agreed to, the 
bill, as amended, be considered read a 
third time and passed, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky is recog-
nized. 
Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, I agree that members of the judi-
cial branch need better protection. In 
fact, I have been appalled that leftwing 
pro-abortion groups released the ad-
dresses of our Supreme Court Justices 
and that there have been people at 
their houses trying to intimidate them. 
It is appalling and shouldn’t happen. 
Whoever it was that released the ad-
dresses of the Supreme Court Justices 
should be punished. 
So I think there is bipartisan support 
in this. I was disappointed though that 
the White House has not condemned 
the release of the Supreme Court Jus-
tices. I think that ranting and raving 
and noise all night is disturbing the 
peace and isn’t actually First Amend-
ment protected speech. 
But if recent years have taught us 
anything, it is that Members of the leg-
islative branch also need protection. 
That was clear in 2011 when Congress-
woman Gabby Giffords was tragically 
shot while doing the most important 
part of her job, meeting with constitu-
ents. 
Words cannot express how happy and 
inspired I was to see Congresswoman 
Giffords was in the Chamber as her 
husband, Senator KELLY, was recently 
sworn in, but words also cannot express 
the pain felt by the families of the peo-
ple who were killed and wounded that 
day. 
That should have been a wakeup call 
to better protect Members of Congress 
and, in doing so, better protect the peo-
ple around them. But just a few years 
ago, a shooter nearly killed Congress-
man STEVE SCALISE during practice for 
the annual charity baseball game. I 
know. I was there. One staffer was shot 
less than 10 feet from me. 
The Capitol Hill police were there 
and saved our lives. Had they not been 
there, things might have been much 
worse. But the Capitol Police aren’t ev-
erywhere, and our families live in 
many cities outside of Washington. Ex-
tending the provisions of this bill to 
Members of Congress would do nothing 
to change the content. In fact, I believe 
our legislative changes add four words 
‘‘and Members of Congress.’’ 
So I think these protections actually 
are good protections. I agree with the 
spirit of the bill; I agree with the letter 
of the bill, but really it should be judi-
cial folks protected as well as Con-
gress. 
My substitute amendment, which I 
will offer for unanimous consent, would 
make a simple change. My amendment 
would simply extend the protections 
that would be offered to the judicial 
branch to the legislative branch. 
So I ask the committee-reported 
amendment be withdrawn and that the 
Senator modify his request to include 
my substitute amendment which is at 
the desk; that the substitute amend-
ment be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. 
I appreciate the desire of the Senator 
from Kentucky to protect Members of 
the legislative branch. I wish someone 
would have come to the floor the other 
night when we had a rush, which I 
thought was important, to protect Su-
preme Court Justices. That was a mo-
ment in which that could have been 
pursued. That went through lightning 
speed. That didn’t even have a hearing. 
It didn’t go through the process of the 
Judiciary Committee like this bill has, 
but there was no such call. 
And so I would work with my col-
league on a separate legislation to pro-
vide protections for a different uni-
verse, including a legislative one. I 
know there are other Members who 
want to provide these protections to 
everyone. The question is that none of 
that has been moving on the floor. 
None of that has had the time and at-
tention in the committee processes to 
ferret out the challenges, the issues, 
and whatnot. But every day we see vio-
lence against judges across the coun-
try, and we have an opportunity to 
take a moment of tragedy and turn it 
into something powerful. 
And I would work with my colleague 
on his desire, but at this point, because 
I am concerned that what we would do 
is not find a pathway in the House be-
cause there are already challenges in 
the House, even to the simple propo-
sition of limiting these protections to 
Members of the Federal judiciary, I am 
afraid that such an expansion under 
this bill would render it useless in 
terms of any action in the House, and 
so I have to object to the proposed 
amendment but with a desire to work 
with my colleague on anything I can to 
move forward in a different way. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. PAUL. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, just 
a brief remark. You know, I regret that 
in the goal to protect ourselves, we 
can’t protect others. 
Not every law where we seek to pro-
vide a protection is ultimately grandly 
approached. I think that the passage of 
this bill would send a clear message to 
our Federal judiciary, who are not on 
the awesome Supreme Court, that they 
will be protected just the same as any 
Supreme Court Justice and that they 
can make their judgments without fear 
that violence will come their way to 
them or their family because of the de-
cisions they make in our society. 
And then building upon that success, 
we can try to build and create greater 
protections for others. But this maxi-
malist position is, unfortunately, one 
that, at the end of the day, doesn’t pro-
vide protection for anyone. 
And so I will keep coming back to 
the floor. We will keep working to try 
to make this happen because this 
young man who died senselessly and 
his parents who had to bury their only 
son—his memory cannot die in vain. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama is recognized. 
MEXICO 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak about what I be-
lieve are unlawful actions taken by the 
Government of Mexico against Vulcan 
Materials 
Company, 
which 
is 
headquartered in Birmingham, AL. 
Vulcan is the Nation’s largest pro-
ducer of construction aggregates, pri-
marily crushed stone, sand, and gravel. 
Vulcan is also a major producer of 
aggregates-based construction mate-
rials like asphalt and ready-mixed con-
crete. 
The materials produced by Vulcan 
are used in nearly all forms of con-
struction, like infrastructure repairs to 
bridges or roads or when a new office 
building is being built. 
While headquartered in Alabama, 
Vulcan has 720 facilities and more than 
12,000 employees across the United 
States. 
Its reach is also international. Vul-
can has operated a quarry in the Yuca-
tan Peninsula of Mexico since the 
1980s. The quarry supplies aggregates 
to Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi, South Carolina, and Texas. 
Vulcan has quarried limestone legally 
in Mexico on land that it owns for over 
30 years. It has full ownership of its 
property in Mexico and owns the lime-
stone reserves on the property. Vulcan 
also operates the only deepwater port 
on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. 
Vulcan operates that port because Vul-
can built that port. 
Furthermore, it is my understanding 
that Vulcan has always complied with 
Mexican law and permitting, which is 
why I was shocked to hear Mexican

S2479 
May 12, 2022 
President 
Lopez 
Obrador 
announce 
that he would pursue legal actions to 
close Vulcan’s operations. His baseless 
claim is that the company is operating 
illegally in Mexico after 30 years. That 
statement is categorically false. 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Obrador 
followed through with his threat for 
legal action. Last week, Mexican Gov-
ernment officials unexpectedly pre-
sented local Vulcan employees with or-
ders to immediately cease operations 
on Vulcan’s own land in Mexico. I be-
lieve this shutdown, ordered by the 
President of Mexico, represents a base-
less attack on a U.S. company and 
demonstrates a disregard for the rule 
of law. 
But even before shutdown orders 
were issued, Vulcan was subject to pub-
lic harassment and intimidation tac-
tics from the President of Mexico, in-
cluding the Mexican Navy sending 
troops to the entrance of the Vulcan 
facility for the last several days before 
last week, the Mexican Navy flying 
Blackhawk helicopters and drones over 
Vulcan’s property, the Mexican Navy 
sending patrol boats to Vulcan’s har-
bor, and the Mexican Government 
withholding the issuance of a routine 
customs permit from January through 
mid-February. 
These actions by the President and 
Mexican Government are contrary to 
the most basic principles of inter-
national law and the free-trade agree-
ments that bind our two countries to-
gether. These actions also go against 
the objectives and principles jointly 
set by the U.S. and Mexican Govern-
ments as part of the high-level eco-
nomic dialogue established in Sep-
tember of 2021. 
However, President Obrador’s attack 
on Vulcan is bigger than just one com-
pany. It undermines the rule of law in 
Mexico, ignores international law and 
free-trade agreements, weakens our bi-
lateral relationship, and will discour-
age future U.S. investments in Mexico. 
We have all heard about the actions 
President Lopez Obrador has attempted 
to take against U.S. energy companies 
in Mexico. This latest action is an ex-
ample of just how far he is willing to 
go. 
These actions will also have a direct 
impact on the supply chain for major 
infrastructure projects in the United 
States. We cannot allow this to stand. 
Back in February, Senator SHELBY 
and I wrote Secretary Blinken to ex-
press alarm over actions Mexico was 
taking against Vulcan. It turns out we 
were right to be concerned. So I urge 
the Biden administration to take ap-
propriate action in order to ensure Vul-
can, a great American company, is able 
to maintain critical operations in the 
country of Mexico. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this 
week, 
America 
commemorates 
Na-
tional Police Week—a time to pay trib-
ute to the men and women of law en-
forcement and remember those who 
have made the ultimate sacrifice to 
protect and defend our communities. 
One of the most emblematic remind-
ers of that sacrifice is the National 
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, 
which, of course, is here in Wash-
ington, DC. It is a beautiful tribute to 
the Federal, State, and local law en-
forcement officials who have died in 
the line of duty and features marble 
walls engraved with more than 23,000 
names. Each of those names represents 
a hero to their community, to their 
State, and to our Nation. Sadly, the 
names of 90 Texans were added to that 
memorial this year. These officers gave 
their lives in service to their commu-
nities and to our country, and we 
thank them, and we thank their fami-
lies for that service. 
As we mourn the loss of so many of 
these heroes, this week is also a time 
to honor and thank those who continue 
to serve and protect our neighbor-
hoods, our schools, and our places of 
work. 
I am grateful for the dedicated police 
officers who work in Texas commu-
nities, from Brownsville to Amarillo, 
from Beaumont to El Paso, and every-
where in between. That includes not 
only the municipal police officers but 
also the sheriffs, the constables, the 
Border Patrol agents, and law enforce-
ment officials of all types who keep 
Texans safe. 
Like all of my colleagues here in 
Congress, I am also grateful to the men 
and women of the Capitol Police, who 
safeguard this building and the Mem-
bers, the staff, the journalists, and 
many visitors who come here every 
day. 
A career in law enforcement is never 
easy, but the past few years have really 
shown a light on the challenges Amer-
ica’s law enforcement officers face. 
First came the pandemic. While mil-
lions of Americans hunkered down at 
home to slow the spread of the virus, 
law enforcement couldn’t do that. They 
had to be out and about in the commu-
nity. They had to lace up their boots 
and go to work every day. The risk of 
the virus meant that even friendly 
interactions with the public could 
carry grave risks. 
More than half of 619 heroes added to 
the wall of the National Law Enforce-
ment Officers Memorial this year died 
of COVID-related causes. More than 
half of the 619 who died, died of COVID- 
related causes. It is a deep reminder of 
the losses our country has experienced 
over the last 2 years. 
The stresses of the pandemic also led 
to a surge in drug overdose deaths and 
an increase in family violence, putting 
an even tighter strain on officers serv-
ing and protecting our communities. 
At the same time, we have seen a 
shocking increase in violent crime and 
homicide rates across the country. 
In addition to these challenges, con-
versations about racial justice and po-
lice brutality have put all of the law 
enforcement community under a bright 
spotlight. Sadly, this debate has, in 
part, perhaps inadvertently, contrib-
uted to a hostile environment for many 
of these officers—people painting with 
a broad brush, claiming that all law en-
forcement officers were somehow racist 
or that the system was rotten to the 
core with systemic racism. Well, that 
kind of rhetoric and those kinds of 
ideas undermine the morale and are a 
disservice, in my opinion, to the men 
and women who do not share any of 
those prejudices, thankfully. 
Well, law enforcement has been the 
victim of violent attacks during this 
last year. According to the FBI, inten-
tional killings of law enforcement offi-
cers have reached a 20-year high. 
Now, don’t get me wrong, there is no 
doubt we need to continue to work to-
gether to improve transparency and ac-
countability within police forces, and 
we need to strengthen the relationship 
between the police and the commu-
nities in which they serve. I think 
those are things that all of us can 
agree on. But as a country, we need to 
remember that the actions of a few do 
not define the rest. The vast majority 
of our law enforcement officers are 
honorable, dedicated public servants 
who go above and beyond the call of 
duty to keep our families and our com-
munities safe and are committed to 
improving accountability and trust in 
law enforcement. 
We need to do more to support those 
brave men and women who are doing 
the right thing, who are serving honor-
ably at great sacrifice to themselves 
and their family, and work with them 
to help rebuild public trust. 
Here in the Senate, I have introduced 
a range of bills to ensure that our offi-
cers have the training, the resources, 
and the support they need to do their 
jobs. 
Given the undeserved hostility many 
officers are facing, Congress should 
pass the Back the Blue Act, which 
makes clear our support for the public 
servants who have dedicated their lives 
to protecting our communities. This 
legislation adds mandatory penalties 
and makes it a Federal crime to kill or 
attempt to kill a law enforcement offi-
cer but also a Federal judge or a feder-
ally funded public safety officer, and it 
makes it a Federal crime to assault a 
law enforcement officer. 
As I said, these men and women put 
themselves in harm’s way every day to 
keep our communities safe, and we 
need to do more to make it clear that 
violence committed against a law en-
forcement officer will not be tolerated, 
period. The Back the Blue Act sends a 
strong message to the more than 
800,000 law enforcement officers in 
America that they are supported, that 
they are appreciated, and that violence 
against them will not stand.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2480 
May 12, 2022 
I am proud that last year, another 
bill to affirm our support for law en-
forcement was signed into law—the 
Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila Federal 
Officers and Employees Protection Act, 
which carries the names of two ICE 
agents who were viciously ambushed 
by a drug cartel while on duty in Mex-
ico. 
Special Agent Avila suffered serious, 
life-threatening injuries, and, unfortu-
nately, Special Agent Zapata trag-
ically lost his life. 
Their attackers were convicted of 
murder and attempted murder in a U.S. 
court, but an appellate court reversed 
those convictions because of a jurisdic-
tional loophole in the law. 
I introduced legislation to close that 
loophole and ensure that justice does 
not hinge on where that attack oc-
curred. This law now ensures that 
those who harm or attempt to harm a 
Federal law enforcement officer serv-
ing abroad, outside the boundaries of 
the continental United States, can be 
prosecuted in the U.S. court system. 
Again, we have to send a clear mes-
sage of zero tolerance to those who 
would attack our law enforcement offi-
cers. We need to send the message that 
we have their backs and that any at-
tack on them will not be tolerated. 
The last 2 years have also taught us 
that we need to do more to supply our 
law enforcement officials with the re-
sources and the training and the sup-
port they need to do their jobs effec-
tively. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE and I introduced 
the bipartisan Law Enforcement De-es-
calation Training Act, which created a 
dedicated funding stream for de-esca-
lation training. I think we all would 
agree that force should only be used 
when absolutely necessary when law 
enforcement officials answer an emer-
gency call and that those officers 
should have the training and ready 
knowledge of how to use alternatives 
to de-escalate that confrontation, both 
for their protection as well as the pro-
tection of the individual who is acting 
out. This will help train officers in 
these de-escalation tactics as well as 
the most effective and safest ways to 
interact with people experiencing a 
mental health or suicidal crisis. 
Another bill Senator WHITEHOUSE and 
I have introduced is the Residential 
Substance Use Disorder Treatment Act 
which expands access to treatment in 
jails and prisons across the country. 
This program already provides incar-
cerated individuals with access to 
treatment for substance use disorders. 
It is coupled with programs to prepare 
these men and women for reentry into 
civic society and to provide commu-
nity-based treatment once they are re-
leased. The changes included in this 
legislation will give incarcerated men 
and women the best possible shot at 
living a healthier and more productive 
life once they are released. This bill 
passed the Senate unanimously last 
year, and I hope that the House will 
move it soon. 
There are a range of other bipartisan 
bills to better support law enforcement 
so they can do their jobs and we can 
demonstrate our support and commit-
ment to them. I introduced the Public 
Safety Officers Support Act with Sen-
ator DUCKWORTH to provide better men-
tal health resources for our law en-
forcement officers. This bill would also 
ensure that families of law enforce-
ment officers who die by suicide that is 
work-related will receive the benefits 
they are entitled to. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR and I have intro-
duced the Justice and Mental Health 
Collaboration Reauthorization Act to 
continue grants for mental health 
courts, crisis intervention teams, and 
other programs that promote public 
safety, as well as improve mental 
health outcomes and reduce recidi-
vism. 
Finally, I am working on a reauthor-
ization of the Project Safe Neighbor-
hoods Act. This has been a proven na-
tional partnership between Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement to use 
data-driven, evidence-based and trau-
ma-informed practices to reduce vio-
lent crime. 
It is inspired by a successful program 
initiated when I was Texas attorney 
general. We called it Texas Exile, but 
it actually originated in a U.S. attor-
ney’s office in Richmond, VA, known 
as Project Exile. It is basically going 
after people who cannot legally use or 
carry a firearm because of a prior fel-
ony conviction, and targeting those 
particular individuals has had a very 
important positive impact on gun vio-
lence in our communities. It is due for 
reauthorization at the end of Sep-
tember and I am committed to making 
it better, stronger, and more effective. 
So today and every day, I am grate-
ful for the brave men and women who 
answered the call to serve and to pro-
tect our communities. There is nothing 
we can do to adequately thank them 
and their families for that sacrifice, 
but we can take positive action to dem-
onstrate our support for our brothers 
and sisters in blue. 
I hope we can advance these bills to 
provide them with the support, the 
funding, and the resources they need to 
do their jobs. And on behalf of the 
great State of Texas, I want to say 
thank you to all of the law enforce-
ment officers, men and women alike, as 
well as their families, who continue to 
put their lives on the line to keep us 
safe every day. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 7691 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
am offering this unanimous consent on 
behalf of myself and Leader MCCON-
NELL. Let me explain the unanimous 
consent. 
As the war in Ukraine extends into 
its third month, we have a moral obli-
gation—a moral obligation—to stand 
with Ukraine in its fight against 
Putin’s immoral war. 
Earlier this week, the House passed a 
Ukraine package with overwhelming 
bipartisan support. It should be no dif-
ferent here in the Senate. The package 
is ready to go. The vast majority of 
Senators on both sides of the aisle 
wants it. There is now only one thing 
holding us back. The junior Senator 
from Kentucky is preventing the swift 
passage of Ukraine aid because he 
wants to add, at the last minute, his 
own changes directly into the bill. His 
change is strongly opposed by many 
Members from both parties. He is not 
even asking for an amendment; he is 
simply saying: My way or the highway. 
When you have a proposal to amend a 
bill, you can’t just come to the floor 
and demand it by fiat. You have to con-
vince other Members to back it first. 
That is how the Senate works. If every 
Member held every bill in exchange for 
every last little demand, it would mean 
the total and permanent paralysis of 
this Chamber. The junior Senator from 
Kentucky knows that perfectly well. 
He knows that is not how this Chamber 
works. 
Again, when you have a proposal to 
change a bill, you have to convince 
Members to support it. The junior Sen-
ator from Kentucky has not done that. 
So right now, in conjunction with 
Leader MCCONNELL, I am giving Sen-
ator PAUL an opportunity to do just 
that. I am offering to hold a vote on his 
amendment, even though I disagree 
with it. Let the Chamber speak its will. 
Let both sides of the aisle have input. 
And, for Heaven’s sake, let’s get 
Ukraine funding done ASAP. 
We must keep our promise to the 
people of Ukraine, and I hope the jun-
ior Senator from Kentucky does not 
stand in the way of keeping that prom-
ise. If Senator PAUL persists in his 
reckless demand, we will not allow him 
to insert his language into this bill 
without a vote, and all he will accom-
plish is to singlehandedly delay des-
perately needed Ukraine aid. 
I yield to the Republican leader. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
as I said earlier today, the Ukraine 
people are fighting valiantly in a war 
they didn’t ask for. Their brave self-de-
fense has literally shocked the skeptics 
and inspired freedom-loving people all 
around the world. 
Ukraine is not asking us to fight this 
war. They are only asking for the re-
sources they need to defend themselves 
against this deranged invasion, and 
they need this help right now. 
Sending lethal assistance to Ukraine 
is not just some kind of philanthropy; 
this conflict has direct and major con-
sequences for America’s national secu-
rity and America’s national interests.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2481 
May 12, 2022 
Russia’s aggression cannot—cannot— 
be allowed to continue cost-free. 
I understand my friend and colleague 
from Kentucky would like changes to 
the bill. Those changes are not accept-
able to the Democratic majority, as we 
have just heard. So I think there is a 
simple way to solve this. We should 
vote on Senator PAUL’s amendment, 
and then we should pass the supple-
mental, and we should do it today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
behalf of myself and Leader MCCON-
NELL, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to legislative ses-
sion and proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 366, S. 4190, 
Senator KENNEDY’s bill on Ukraine 
oversight; that the bill be considered 
read a third time and the Senate vote 
on passage of the bill; further, that 
upon disposition of the Kennedy bill, 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of Calendar No. 368, H.R. 
7691, a bill to provide aid to Ukraine; 
that the only amendment in order be 
the Paul amendment, which is at the 
desk; that the Senate vote on the Paul 
amendment with 60 affirmative votes 
required for adoption; that the bill be 
read a third time and the Senate vote 
on passage of the bill, as amended, if 
amended; and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table, all without intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, my oath of office is to the U.S. 
Constitution, not to any foreign na-
tion. And no matter how sympathetic 
the cause, my oath of office is to the 
national security of the United States 
of America. 
We cannot save Ukraine by dooming 
the U.S. economy. In March, inflation 
hit a 40-year high. Gasoline alone is up 
48 percent, and energy prices are up 32 
percent over the last year. Food prices 
have increased by nearly 9 percent. 
Used vehicle prices are up 35 percent 
for the year, and new vehicle prices 
have increased 12 percent or more. 
Yes, inflation doesn’t just come out 
of nowhere; it comes from deficit 
spending. 
The United States spent nearly $5 
trillion on COVID–19 bailouts, leading 
to one of the highest and most sus-
tained levels of inflation in U.S. his-
tory. 
Americans are feeling the pain, and 
Congress seems intent only on adding 
to that pain by shoveling more money 
out the door as fast as they can. 
This bill under consideration would 
spend $40 billion. This is the second 
spending bill for Ukraine in 2 months, 
and this bill is three times larger than 
the first. 
Our military aid to Ukraine is noth-
ing new, though. Since 2014, the United 
States has provided more than $6 bil-
lion in security assistance to Ukraine. 
In addition to the $14 billion Congress 
authorized just a month ago, if this bill 
passes, the United States will have au-
thorized roughly $60 billion in total 
spending for Ukraine. 
For those who say this is not enough, 
for those of you in this Chamber who 
say that our military spending is never 
enough, let’s put $60 billion into per-
spective. 
According to Elias Yousef, a security 
assistance expert at the Stimson Cen-
ter, Kyiv would become the largest 
yearly recipient of U.S. military aid of 
the past two decades. 
Except for the top five countries, $60 
billion is more than every other coun-
try in the world spends on their entire 
military expenditures. 
If this gift to Ukraine passes, our 
total aid to Ukraine will almost equal 
the entire military budget of Russia. 
And it is not as if we have that money 
lying around. We will have to borrow 
that money from China to send it to 
Ukraine. 
The cost of this package we are vot-
ing on today is more than the United 
States spent during the first year of 
the U.S. conflict in Afghanistan. Con-
gress authorized force, and the Presi-
dent sent troops into the conflict. The 
same cannot be said of Ukraine. 
This proposal towers over domestic 
priorities as well. The massive package 
of $60 billion to Ukraine dwarfs the $6 
million spent on cancer research annu-
ally, and $60 billion is more than the 
amount the government collects in gas 
taxes each year to build roads and 
bridges. The $60 billion to Ukraine can 
fund substantial portions or entire 
large Cabinet Departments. The $60 bil-
lion nearly equals the entire State De-
partment budget. The $60 billion ex-
ceeds the budget for the Department of 
Homeland Security and for the Depart-
ment of Energy. And Congress just 
wants to keep on spending and spend-
ing. 
Our allies and partners have sent aid 
to Ukraine. Some of them even broke 
longstanding 
traditions 
by 
sending 
military assistance. Germany, Poland, 
the United Kingdom, and others are 
stepping up to defend Ukraine like 
never before. 
In other words, it is not all about us. 
It isn’t that we always have to be the 
Uncle Sam, the policeman who saves 
the world, particularly when it is on 
borrowed money. Yet the United States 
accounted for nearly half of what has 
been spent so far. 
With a $30 trillion debt, America 
can’t afford to be the world’s police-
man. The United States is trying to re-
cover from the $1.6 trillion we spent on 
wars in the Middle East, not to men-
tion 
the 
$5 
trillion 
borrowed 
for 
COVID. 
We should not forget that the Soviet 
Union collapsed, in large part, not be-
cause it was defeated militarily but be-
cause it ran out of money. In an at-
tempt to save Ukraine, will we doom 
the United States to such a future? 
In the past 2 years, the United States 
has borrowed more money than at any 
time in our history. We are already ex-
periencing the greatest rate of infla-
tion in over four decades. The assault 
on monetary discipline is untenable, 
and it cannot go on forever. Unless we 
put an end to the fiscal insanity, a day 
of reckoning awaits us. 
Congress should evaluate the cost of 
continuing down this path. The biggest 
threat to the United States today is 
debt and inflation and the destruction 
of the dollar. We cannot save Ukraine 
by killing our economic strength. 
So I ask to modify the bill to allow 
for a special inspector general. This 
would be the inspector general who has 
been overseeing the waste in Afghani-
stan and has done a great job. 
Therefore, I ask the Senator to mod-
ify his request so that the Senate pro-
ceed to the immediate consideration of 
Calendar No. 368, H.R. 7691; further-
more, that the Paul amendment at the 
desk be considered and agreed to; that 
the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time; and that the Senate 
vote on passage of the bill, as amended, 
with a 60-affirmative vote threshold for 
passage. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
leader so modify his request? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object, it is clear from the junior 
Senator from Kentucky’s remarks, he 
doesn’t want to aid Ukraine. That is 
not the case for the overwhelming ma-
jority here. 
Again, all he will accomplish with his 
actions here today is to delay that aid, 
not to stop it. It is aid that is des-
perately needed by a valiant people 
fighting against authoritarianism and 
defending democracy. So I will not 
modify it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the original request? 
Mr. PAUL. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
MEXICO 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
am here today to discuss worrying de-
velopments 
in 
Mexico—one 
of 
the 
United States most important inter-
national partners and our neighbor to 
the south. 
The nearly 2,000-mile border that our 
nations share, both binds us together 
and presents a series of challenges, in-
cluding illegal immigration, drug con-
trol, and human trafficking. 
But as we work through these dif-
ficult issues, our robust economic rela-
tionship has provided a firm foundation 
to strengthen and stabilize our efforts 
with an eye toward the future. 
The innovative U.S.-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement—or 
USMCA, 
as 
it 
is 
called—has deepened the connections 
between our two economies, such that 
Mexico is now one of our largest and 
most strategic trading partners. 
However, actions over the past year 
by the government of Mexican Presi-
dent Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, 
better known as AMLO, have weakened 
that bond and are threatening the eco-
nomic and diplomatic ties of our two 
nations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2482 
May 12, 2022 
Through increasingly arbitrary and 
aggressive moves against companies 
based here in the United States and 
their lawfully owned assets in Mexico, 
the Mexican Government has abused 
its permitting and regulatory powers 
in ways that violate the letter and the 
spirit of our trade agreements and the 
special relationship that exists be-
tween our two countries. These deci-
sions directly impact critical sectors of 
the U.S. economy, from agriculture to 
energy and mining, from transpor-
tation to tourism. 
These capricious actions, which are 
falsely labeled as ‘‘reforms,’’ risk sub-
stantially undermining confidence in 
the commercial rule of law in Mexico, 
and these actions also risk jeopardizing 
the essential economic relations in 
North America. 
Further, these actions likely violate 
our trade agreements by abrogating 
contracts, stripping investors of value, 
and eliminating private competition 
and oversight, thereby sending a clear 
message to U.S. capital markets that 
Mexico is no longer safe nor profitable 
for investing. 
Earlier 
this 
month, 
AMLO 
even 
threatened to jail political opponents 
and investors who stand in his way, 
desperately attempting to impose a 
state-centered, anti-free-market agen-
da. If not quickly corrected, these ac-
tions risk choking off the economic re-
lationship between our two nations. 
Many 
important 
supply 
chains 
stretch across the U.S.-Mexico border, 
supporting millions of good jobs and 
making both countries more attractive 
for capital investment. This is cer-
tainly true for my home State of Ten-
nessee. Because of that success, I have 
advocated for further expanding the in-
tegrated North American supply chain 
for critical industries as a better and 
more stable alternative to manufac-
turing and exporting from communist 
China. 
Utilizing the successes of the USMCA 
as the backbone for a renewed vision of 
North American competitiveness would 
benefit both American and Mexican 
prosperity, as well as both of our na-
tions’ national security. It would also 
better align the economic strategies 
and national interests of our two coun-
tries. 
But without a basic respect for pri-
vate property and the rule of law, that 
mutually beneficial progress will not 
happen. In fact, failing to protect pri-
vate property and the rule of law will 
inevitably lead to the disintegration of 
economic ties. 
Therefore, I urge President Lopez 
Obrador to reverse course before more 
damage is done. Instead, we should be 
looking for opportunities to work to-
gether 
to 
attract 
investment 
and 
unlock economic opportunity that is 
presented by the global rebalancing of 
supply chains away from communist 
China. Let’s seize the opportunity to-
gether rather than damage our shared 
interests for short-term political gains. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to enter into a 
colloquy with my colleagues Senator 
WHITEHOUSE and Senator BLUMENTHAL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, we 
will get into this in a minute, but I 
want to respond to something that was 
said just a few minutes ago. 
What would it cost America if Putin 
continues to slaughter Ukraine and 
gets away with it? What kind of world 
do you want to live in? 
Let’s see if I have got this right. I 
can understand not wanting to get in-
volved in wars. If you have ever been in 
one, if you have ever been in a war zone 
for any time period, you understand 
war is a horrible thing. If you have 
ever been in the military, you under-
stand some of your buddies don’t come 
back when you have wars. 
But what I don’t understand is this 
idea that not only are we not going to 
engage in a war against a thug and a 
bully like Putin but, when somebody 
like Ukraine is fighting like tigers, we 
are not going to help them either. 
So this idea about this aid package 
costing too much, put it in the context 
of what happens to the world if Putin 
continues to rewrite the map of Eu-
rope. If we don’t get Ukraine right, 
then China will invade Taiwan. And 90 
percent of all the semiconductors and 
high-end chips come out of Taiwan. 
Why do you have the cops? Because if 
people go up and down the streets 
breaking into stores and ransacking 
the community, nobody wants to live 
there. I would rather have the rule of 
law versus the rule of gun. Sometimes, 
you have to pay a price. Ukrainians are 
paying the ultimate price. They are 
fighting like tigers. They are dying by 
the thousands to stand up to an enemy 
of the United States and mankind. 
Putin is a war criminal by any rea-
sonable definition, and if you think he 
is satisfied with Ukraine, you are mis-
calculating him like we did in the last 
century with Hitler. In June of last 
year, Putin talked about the Russian 
Empire being recreated. Well, it is just 
not Ukraine that he considers a legal 
fiction; it would be Moldova. And when 
you look at his view of recreating pos-
sibly the former Soviet Union, there 
are NATO nations in his crosshairs. 
What does it matter to the United 
States, if Europe is in a constant state 
of turmoil, that you have Russia top-
pling one democracy after another? It 
means a lot to us. We can’t live in a 
world that way—or at least, I choose 
not to live in a world that way. 
To the American people, $40 billion is 
a lot of money, but if we can stop 
Putin in Ukraine, it would be the best 
money you could ever spend. Let’s 
don’t be penny wise and pound foolish. 
They are running out of ammo. They 
are kicking the Russians’ ass all over 
Ukraine. They are doing the fighting 
on behalf of freedom itself, and we 
should be the arsenal of democracy. 
The EU should spend more. The Ger-
mans are giving lethal weapons. Every-
body can do more. 
And there is a problem with baby for-
mula. I would like to get more baby 
formula on the shelves, but letting 
Putin win in Ukraine doesn’t help the 
problem of babies here in America. If 
you care about raising your children, 
you need formula, but you need a world 
where you can travel and trade without 
chaos. 
Who is going to run the world in the 
21st century: the communist dictator-
ship in China, people like Putin, or a 
world order where the rule of law real-
ly matters more than the rule of gun? 
So this package has been stalled, but 
it will get over the finish line. 
To the people in Ukraine, Senator 
PAUL’s request to have an inspector 
general overseeing the money actually 
makes sense to me. I don’t know why 
we didn’t do that before, but his argu-
ment that this package is way beyond 
what the market should bear misses 
the point of what we are engaged in 
here. 
The outcome of Ukraine matters be-
cause if you don’t stop Putin there, he 
keeps going. This doesn’t end. Have 
you learned nothing from World War 
II? Go watch a movie about World War 
II. How many people appeased Hitler to 
the point that 50 million people eventu-
ally died? Putin is not going to stop in 
Ukraine unless somebody stops him. 
Here is the good news: His army was 
oversold; and with the weapons we 
have delivered to Ukraine, plus our al-
lies, the Ukrainian military and citi-
zenry are dismantling the Russian 
military. It would be an enormous blow 
for freedom and stabilize the world if 
we could stop Putin in Ukraine. And 
the Ukrainians are not asking us for 
soldiers; they are asking us for weap-
ons. 
And if you don’t think Russia under 
Putin is a foe to the United States and 
all we believe in, you haven’t been pay-
ing attention to what has been going 
on for the last 20 years. 
So we have a moment in time here to 
go all in in terms of economic assist-
ance. Their economy is in shambles be-
cause they are under siege. They are 
fighting like tigers. The weapons we 
have given them, they have put to good 
purpose. The Democrats and Repub-
licans are now united around the idea 
that it is a good thing to help Ukraine. 
To my Republican colleagues who 
vote against this package, what is your 
alternative? Don’t go to Poland any-
more. Don’t go to Ukraine and say: We 
are with you. If you vote against this 
package—and there are a million rea-
sons to vote against anything—you are 
missing the point. The world hangs in 
the balance here. If we don’t get 
Ukraine right and stand up to Putin, 
there goes Taiwan. 
I am tired of being lectured to by 
people who have no understanding of

the world in which we live. The mis-
takes of the last century are being 
played out on our screen every night. 
So to those who believe that we can 
just let it go in Ukraine, boy, you are 
going to be in for a rude awakening. 
The world is going to be turned upside 
down, and the converse is true. 
If we can stop him in his tracks, help 
the Ukrainians, who are doing all the 
fighting and dying, then China is less 
likely to go into Taiwan. 
This is one of the biggest moments in 
the 21st century. Where are you? Whose 
side are you on? 
Oh, it is too much here; it is too 
much there. To one Senator who will 
remain nameless on our side, why don’t 
we have money for food? There are 227 
million people in the world knocking 
on famine’s door. Between droughts 
and wars all over the world, the World 
Food Programme run by Governor 
Beasley from South Carolina is com-
pletely under siege. Forty-something 
countries in the world have over 50 per-
cent of their grain supply coming from 
Ukraine, and they are out of produc-
tion right now. 
It is in our interest, ladies and gen-
tlemen, to help people when they are 
starving so they don’t do the things 
that they may do to feed their families 
that are bad for us. What would you do 
to feed your family? Would you take 
money from Al Qaeda and ISIS if it was 
the only source of money available to 
feed your family? So we live in a very 
dangerous time where one thing affects 
the other. 
This package was put together quick-
ly, and I am sure there are things in 
this package that could be done better. 
But we are living in realtime here. The 
President’s ability to send weapons 
really expires in a couple of days. 
So what I hope will happen is that we 
will unite around the idea that Putin is 
the bad guy and the Ukrainians are the 
good guys, and if we lose this war, we 
are going to regret losing this war be-
cause it won’t end in Ukraine. 
So to my two colleagues on the 
Democratic side, thank you both. You 
have done something that is hard for 
people around here to do. Talk about 
victory, victory for Ukraine—Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, there has been no strong-
er voice of standing up to Putin and 
making him pay a price. How many 
people does he have to murder? How 
many war crimes does he have to com-
mit until we realize this needs to stop? 
We had this same experience with 
Adolf Hitler. People excused his behav-
ior, wrote it off as he just wants to get 
German-speaking territories back. No. 
He wrote a book about what he wanted 
to do. He wanted to kill all the Jews 
and remake Europe and create a mas-
ter race for people on planet Earth, in 
his own image. 
What is Putin trying to do? A bit less 
ambitious: create the Russian Empire 
in the former Soviet Union anew, crush 
democracies that have had a chance to 
go a different way. And are you sur-
prised that the Ukrainians are fight-
ing? Who the hell would want to live 
under Putin’s thumb? Would you? 
Would you want to live in Putin’s Rus-
sia? Would you want him to be your 
leader if you didn’t have to? People 
who have gone down the communist 
road are literally willing to die because 
they don’t want to raise their children 
that way. 
So we are going to have a discussion 
here in a moment about some things 
that we can do that will matter beyond 
money. The American taxpayer should 
not be the only source of help to the 
Ukrainian people. Count me in for 
that. 
There is a proposal that was left out 
of this bill that would empower the De-
partment of Justice to go after Putin 
and all of his cronies and take from 
them their yachts and their villas and 
their dachas, sell it, and put the money 
into Ukraine to buy bullets. That got 
left out of the package. 
To the American people, I get it. 
Other people should be doing more. 
There is a bipartisan consensus here 
that, with additional resources in the 
hands of the Department of Justice and 
some legal changes, we could go after 
billions of dollars of ill-gotten gain and 
ply it back into the Ukrainian war ef-
fort—money coming from thugs and 
thieves in Russia—to help the brave 
people in Ukraine. But that fell out of 
the package. 
To my colleagues in this body, what 
the hell are you thinking? Why would 
you do that? Why would you take out 
of the package the ability to hunt 
down the oligarchs and take their stuff 
away from them—that they bought 
with 
stolen 
money—to 
help 
the 
Ukrainian people, another source of 
revenue other than the American tax-
payer? We are not going to let that go. 
Finally, there is an idea that Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and I have that maybe it 
is time to label Russia a state sponsor 
of terrorism. Why? Because they are. 
After 20 years of mass murder on an 
industrial scale, the Wagner Group is 
roaming the planet, which is a proxy, 
according to our Treasury Department, 
of the Russian military. They are in 
Africa today doing all kinds of horrible 
things. Russia is propping Assad up, 
who is one of the four countries that 
are considered state sponsors of ter-
rorism. 
Without Russia, Assad would have 
fallen. So we have an idea that doesn’t 
cost any money to designate Putin’s 
Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, 
and it would allow and waive sovereign 
immunity so people who are a victim of 
his terrorism could take him to court. 
And it would put Putin in a club that 
he deserves to be in—Iran, North 
Korea, Syria. We would add Russia. We 
couldn’t get that in the package. We 
are not going to stop. 
It would be good to let the Ukrainian 
people know that we see Russia in the 
hands of Putin as a terrorist state. We 
would like to tell everybody who is on 
the fence, America has made a decision 
about Putin and there is no going back. 
If he is still standing when this is all 
done and we forgive and forget, the 
worst is yet to come. 
So from my point of view, Putin’s 
Russia needs to end. The Russian peo-
ple need to fix this problem. Until they 
do, we need to keep all the sanctions in 
place and up the ante. Labeling Putin’s 
Russia a ‘‘state sponsor of terrorism’’ 
is a good place to start. Going after the 
ill-gotten gains of the oligarchs to help 
the war effort is a good thing to do. 
We are not going to quit here. 
To the people of Ukraine: Most peo-
ple in this body—not all—are with you 
because 
we 
understand 
your 
fight 
makes our world in America a safer 
place and a better place to live. 
I will ask a question to my colleague 
from Connecticut. Why does he think 
Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism 
and what can we do to make that hap-
pen? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I want to thank 
my friend and colleague who has been 
such a leader of this bipartisan effort, 
Senator GRAHAM, for the question and 
for his powerful and passionate re-
marks just now. 
Very simply, the reason for this bi-
partisan initiative to designate Russia 
a state sponsor of terrorism is because 
of what the American people and the 
world have seen day after day after 
day, not only this assault on Ukraine, 
trying to deprive it of its freedom and 
independence, but also the mass atroc-
ities that its soldiers have committed 
at the direction, potentially, of Vladi-
mir Putin: holding women and children 
hostage when bombs are falling, tying 
people’s hands behind their backs and 
shooting them in their heads, raping 
and torturing innocent civilians, mak-
ing them the targets of warfare in a 
purposeful and direct way, in a reign of 
terror. Make Russia a state sponsor of 
terrorism in the same way that Iran 
and Syria and Cuba have been. Vladi-
mir Putin should be part of that club. 
It will give individuals who are vic-
tims rights of action. But equally im-
portant, it will impose additional sup-
port controls and sanctions and other 
kinds of measures and send the world a 
message that, literally, anybody who 
deals with Russia is dealing with a ter-
rorist cabal, a terrorist organization 
that is beyond the pale, that is to be 
treated as a pariah and is a member of 
a club that no one should want to be a 
part of. 
It costs nothing to give Russia this 
well-merited label. It also works very 
much in favor of not only Ukraine but 
American taxpayers and our NATO al-
lies to have the Asset Seizure for 
Ukraine Reconstruction Act, a bipar-
tisan initiative, that will enable not 
only seizure but also sale of Russian 
oligarch assets as a part of this pack-
age. 
I am disappointed that it wasn’t in-
cluded, but I am very optimistic that 
we will move forward because people 
have seen on their TVs, day after day, 
the seizure of the superyachts. We have 
seen those pictures—the mansions, the

jets, the fine art, other ill-gotten gains. 
They have bought these items with 
money they have stolen from the peo-
ple of Russia and elsewhere around the 
world. Those ill-gotten gains are some-
times in bank accounts that can be 
seized, and they should be used for 
Ukraine’s defense against this invasion 
and for reconstruction of Ukraine. 
Their use should be humanitarian re-
construction efforts, as well as the on-
going fight. They are resources that 
Putin 
has, 
in 
effect, 
enabled 
his 
oligarchs to take in this kleptocracy 
known as the Russian regime. We 
should be cracking down on those bene-
ficiaries 
of 
ill-gotten 
gains 
and 
enablers 
of 
Putin’s 
cruel 
and 
kleptocratic regime. 
Let’s be clear. Once enacted, this 
measure would enable law enforcement 
agents from around the world to seize 
those oligarch assets and enable them 
to liquidate—that is to say, sell those 
assets—to be used immediately to pro-
vide more weapons for the brave 
Ukrainians who are fighting Russian 
aggression and to deliver humanitarian 
aid to displaced Ukrainians. 
I have been to the border and seen 
those refugees coming from Ukraine— 
literally crossing the border, carrying 
their pets and stuffed animals, women 
and children—because the men are 
staying to fight—with just the clothes 
on their back. They need help. Those 
assets should be used to help them, as 
well as the men who are left behind to 
fight with a ferocity and bravery that 
is the awe of the world. Literally, our 
own military has said how deeply im-
pressed they are with the fierceness 
and courage of Ukrainians who are 
pushing back not only from around 
Kyiv, but now in the Donbas, Lutsk, 
and Luhansk. Literally, they are win-
ning victories. 
But those victories are occurring be-
cause of aid we have provided. If we 
cease that aid, they will be deprived of 
the tools they need to win this war. 
Yes, our objective should be Ukraine 
winning this war. We are not going to 
have troops on the ground. We are not 
going to be engaged through NATO. We 
are not going to be a party in the com-
bat. But we can be the arsenal of 
Ukraine’s democracy. We can step up 
and stand up for democracy. 
My colleague has made the point 
very well that history teaches about 
bullies. They are stopped, or they will 
continue. That is a lesson throughout 
history, whether it is World War II or 
any of the other conflicts where ag-
gression has been stymied and halted. 
Vladimir Putin is a thug. He is a 
KGB operative. He understands only 
one thing: force—economic force, mili-
tary force—and that force needs to be 
brought to bear before he moves 
against countries that are at risk. 
What does it mean that Finland 
wants to join NATO? What does it 
mean that Sweden is talking about 
joining NATO? They see the threat. 
They need that protection. They know 
they can’t do it alone. They know that 
Putin will pick them off if we do not 
stand together. 
As Benjamin Franklin said at the 
time of our Revolution: We will hang 
together, or we will hang alone. 
That has to be the mantra that we 
take to our allies and to the American 
people. One last point. We need to 
bring together this body and our Con-
gress in the bipartisan way that the 
three of us are doing today. This issue 
is way above partisan politics in its im-
portance to our future as a nation. 
The American people understandably 
are focused on inflation, which is a se-
rious challenge. They are fatigued and 
tired of COVID, which is not only irk-
some but threatening. Our job is to 
make them aware of the threat that is 
posed by Putin’s Russia. It isn’t the 
Russian people’s Russia. They have no 
idea what is actually happening. They 
believe because they have been told 
that President Zelenskyy, who is Jew-
ish, is actually a Nazi. That is what 
they have been told. 
We visited Ukraine not long before 
the invasion. One of my colleagues in 
this bipartisan trip said to President 
Zelenskyy: Are you fearful about a 
Russian invasion? 
This was January of this year. 
He said: The Russian invasion began 
in 2014. The Russian invasion has been 
ongoing and has killed 14,000 of our 
people. 
This latest threat of an assault on 
Ukraine is just another phase of the 
same war, and Ukrainian people have 
fought on behalf of democracy for these 
years. They have lost blood and lives 
and treasure, and we have an obliga-
tion to stand strong for our democracy 
at this moment. We have an oppor-
tunity and an obligation. 
I am proud to stand with my col-
leagues in favor of using the proceeds 
of selling oligarchs’ ill-begotten gains 
so that we can benefit the people of 
Ukraine in their fight for freedom and 
their effort to reconstruct their coun-
try. 
I would like to yield the floor back to 
my colleague, hopefully, having an-
swered his question and pose a question 
to my colleague from Rhode Island. 
Will the proceeds from the sale of 
these ill-gotten gains potentially ben-
efit Ukraine in a way that will be 
meaningful and will help save Amer-
ican taxpayers’ funds that are nec-
essary to support the freedom of that 
country? 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
would say to Senator BLUMENTHAL, ab-
solutely, yes, and to Senator GRAHAM, 
also yes, and thank you. 
Let me just give a quick overview of 
my part of this colloquy as to where we 
are. 
This began with the Munich Security 
Conference, which Senator GRAHAM and 
I led this year, the so-called McCain 
codel. When we heard about the immi-
nent invasion, we both became very ar-
dent that we needed to get after Rus-
sia’s oligarchs; first, because it was 
turning 
the 
oligarchs 
against 
Yanukovych, which freed up Ukraine, 
and, second, because these oligarchs in 
Russia are part and parcel of the way 
in which Putin has manipulated his 
country and acceded enormous hidden 
wealth to himself. 
So we knew that the oligarchs needed 
to be a target. We talked about it so re-
lentlessly that whenever Secretary of 
State Blinken saw us coming, he would 
say: I know. I know. Oligarchs, I get it. 
Afterward, the President came back 
and he took the Treasury’s Asset For-
feiture Section and the State Depart-
ment’s Asset Forfeiture Section and 
the Department of Justice’s Asset For-
feiture Section and pulled them to-
gether into what he is calling the 
Kleptocratic Initiative. That is a good 
thing the President did. 
In this bill, there is money for it. We 
give $67 million to that enterprise and 
another $30 million to FinCEN, which 
is the group within Treasury that 
tracks dirty money. So that is about 
$100 
million 
to 
support 
the 
KleptoCapture operation. 
What they still need is authorities, 
and that is what our bill would give 
them. When we got back, Senator GRA-
HAM, 
Senator 
WICKER, 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, and I drafted this bill, 
and a version of it has been passed in 
the House, thanks to the leadership of 
Representative TOM MALINOWSKI. And 
after that bill was filed, the Biden ad-
ministration got together and they 
gave technical assistance to us from 
the Department of Justice as to what 
it was that they actually need to be 
more effective at going after these 
oligarchs to seize, to sell, and to send 
to Ukraine the proceeds. 
So that is where we are right now. 
And one of the things that we need is 
to speed up the process; it can take for-
ever to go through the process. We 
need to couch this process in the na-
tional security authorities of the Presi-
dent as much as possible, because this 
is primarily a national security issue. 
We need to speed up the process so 
that, for instance, you don’t have to 
prove who the true beneficial owner is 
before you seize the yacht. 
You can go on intelligence reports. 
You can go on whistleblowers. And, by 
the way, we want to reward whistle-
blowers. You remember the Ukrainian 
who sunk his boss’s yacht and he got 
arrested because he pulled the plug out 
of that yacht and sunk it? 
I would rather have that guy come to 
the Department of Justice and say: I 
can tell you all about who owns this 
yacht. You don’t have to worry about 
going through the Cypriot bank ac-
count, the Cayman Islands shell cor-
poration, the Dakota trust—wherever 
else this has been hidden. I can tell you 
that is the guy—and be able to act 
based on that and have the authority 
to have the action, what is called ‘‘in 
rem’’ by lawyers. You don’t have to 
find the defendant. 
This is United States v. Motor Ves-
sel—whatever it is called—Schehera-
zade. And you give public notice, and

you invite the world to come and make 
whoever has a claim to that yacht to 
show that it is there and it shouldn’t 
be condemned, sold, and the proceeds 
go to Ukraine, which is an interesting 
predicament for the oligarch who owns 
it but has pretended he does not, who 
has hidden behind all these shells. 
He now has to come forward and say: 
Actually I own that yacht. 
Gotcha, game over. 
Or he has to put in some phony to 
come and say: Hey, I actually own that 
yacht. I may be a cellist, but I am a 
billionaire cellist who happens to own 
that yacht. 
And we get to say in a court of law: 
Prove it. Let’s have some real dis-
covery. Let’s have some testimony 
under oath. If this is your yacht, God 
bless you, you can have it. Prove it. We 
dare you. 
I think what is going to happen is a 
lot of these claims are going to be for-
feit, because they are, in fact, crooked. 
And we have every right and every 
need to go after these assets because 
Putin’s attack on Ukraine is sup-
ported, aided, abetted, and given aid 
and comfort to by this retinue of slip-
pery oligarchs around him who have 
protected him. 
You saw 29 of them showing up in 
that big office of his to have the little 
talk with him about how this was all 
going. We know who they are. And we 
know what their role is, and they are 
aiding and abetting and giving aid and 
comfort to an enemy of our ally 
Ukraine—as 
Senator 
GRAHAM
has 
pointed out—at the fulcrum in the 
world of our battle for freedom right 
now. 
If we can’t act on this, shame on us. 
So we are going to continue; we are 
going to continue in bipartisan fashion. 
We are going to take our bill, and we 
are going to add on to it the technical 
language from the Department of Jus-
tice that will specify the authorities 
that they need. And we are going to 
find a way to get this passed. If we 
can’t do it by unanimous consent, 
which I hope we can, then perhaps on 
the NDA or some other must-pass piece 
of legislation. 
But this must be done. And to Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL’s question, will this 
make a difference? Some of these 
yachts cost half a billion dollars, and 
there are dozens of them floating 
around. This is real money. And that is 
before you get to the fancy paintings 
and before you get to the mansions in 
London and before you get to the villas 
on the coast of Spain. 
We need to make it very expensive to 
be an oligarch supporting Putin, and 
we need to take the filthy pelt, the 
lucre that they stole from their coun-
try and put it to the benefit of the 
Ukrainian people. 
So I am delighted that Senator 
WICKER was an initial cosponsor of this 
bill. I am delighted that Senator GRA-
HAM was an initial cosponsor and Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL. 
And I will close by saying that, you 
know, this Munich security delegation 
that we do every year has made a big 
difference on several occasions, be-
cause we get together in bipartisan 
fashion, we are presented with real, im-
mediate problems in the world that we 
face when we go to that conference. 
And we craft bipartisan solutions in 
realtime there, and then we come back 
and deploy them. And that is what was 
done here. We are going to see this 
through. We are going to get this right. 
Thank you, Senator GRAHAM. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Yield for a quick ques-
tion? 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Gladly. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Number one, Senator 
WHITEHOUSE
has been talking about 
this 3 years that I know of. Long before 
Putin invaded Ukraine, when we were 
in charge of the Judiciary Committee, 
we had several hearings about autoc-
racy, about ill-gotten gains, people 
stealing money from their country, but 
particularly in Russia. So I want to 
thank you for understanding this issue 
better than anybody I know and been 
talking about it for years. 
Now, we have a moment here, and to 
my colleagues over here, this is a mo-
ment in world history. This is not 
about, I don’t like this part of the bill, 
and I don’t like that part of the bill. It 
is about you are either going to help 
Ukraine or not, and perfectly so. What-
ever imperfections in this bill that 
exist, the worst possible outcome is to 
say no to the people of Ukraine because 
it is not exactly the way you would 
have done it. 
Now, if you want to say no to the 
people of Ukraine because you don’t 
care about what happens in Ukraine, 
that is a different conversation. Please 
come down here and say that. If you 
believe that the outcome in Ukraine 
has no effect on the national security 
interest of the United States, if you be-
lieve that Putin will stop after Ukraine 
and China is not watching, come down 
here and say it. 
The reason nobody will do that—I 
doubt—is because you would be crazy. 
But you can say it. The floor is yours. 
Come down here and make the argu-
ment that Ukraine is not connected to 
world events and that Putin would be 
satisfied with dismembering that coun-
try and stop. He is not. 
You know, Hitler wrote a book. 
Somebody should have read it. This 
guy gave a speech and for 20 years has 
been acting on that speech. So the peo-
ple around him, the oligarchs—and 
Senator WHITEHOUSE is the oligarchs’ 
worst 
nightmare—have 
been 
living 
large off the system created in Russia 
where everybody gets a piece of the ac-
tion except the Russian people. 
We have got a chance where the 
world is galvanized, and Attorney Gen-
eral Garland, who I have been working 
with on this, has been very good, needs 
some changes in the law to make this 
more effective. 
About seizing yachts, you have got to 
have a reasonable belief that the yacht 
is part of a criminal enterprise, an ill- 
gotten gain. You seize the yacht, and 
you ask people to come forward to con-
test your assertion. If they don’t, then 
it proves all you need to know. If they 
have got a good counterclaim, then 
they win in court. 
But right now, you have got this 
game where you have to find a specific 
person, which is crazy. Seize the yacht 
if there is reasonable evidence it is part 
of one of these enterprises. This bill 
that we are talking about would do 
that. 
And why it didn’t get in the package, 
I don’t know. But I want to ask Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE one final question: 
How much money does he think could 
be gathered up if we unleashed law en-
forcement throughout the world to go 
after these oligarchs, and what would 
be the signal we would be sending 
throughout the world if we actually did 
this? 
Would it make the world a better 
place? What is his view? 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The oligarchs 
working with and for Vladimir Putin 
have stolen almost all of the wealth of 
Russia. These are extremely wealthy 
individuals. If you can afford a $500 
million yacht, you have got money to 
burn. And that is not your only asset— 
that is just your yacht. 
And you have got all the other stuff, 
the villas and the mansions and the 
artworks and the jets and all of that. 
The number is obviously in the tens of 
billions of dollars. When you consider 
that we are appropriating $40 billion, I 
think it is a fair bet that we can do 
half again, just from these oligarchs. 
And 
to 
have 
that 
money 
go 
to 
Ukraine’s relief, to its victory, and to 
its rebuilding would be a very, very 
good use. 
And at the same time, it would pro-
vide the strategic feature that it would 
start turning these greedy oligarchs 
against Putin because we are going to 
keep coming after them until this is 
over, and it would disable his appa-
ratus of control over Russia, which is 
run through being basically a gang of 
thieves who all allow each other to loot 
their country. 
I am reminded of Senator GRAHAM’s 
great friend, Senator McCain, who used 
to describe Russia as a gas station run 
by gangsters with an army. 
Well, this turns the gangsters against 
each other, in addition to taking ill- 
gotten gains and turning them to a val-
uable and proper use. And the message 
it sends is: If you are a crooked oli-
garch who will support a dictator, a ty-
rant who will go into another country 
and shell its schools, send cruise mis-
siles into its apartment buildings, tar-
get artillery at its hospitals, you are 
not going to get away with that easily. 
And it sends a signal through that to 
the entire world of kleptocracy, which 
extends beyond Russia, that your days 
of thievery are numbered, we are going 
to have the resources to put rule of law 
back in charge. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I can’t say it any bet-
ter. Just to wrap this up, I believe that

if there were a vote tomorrow desig-
nating Russia as a state sponsor of ter-
rorism, we would get 90 votes in the 
U.S. Senate. I will ask Senator WHITE-
HOUSE to comment on that. I think we 
could take his idea, his kleptocracy re-
gime, and embolden the Department of 
Justice and others to make it easier to 
go after these assets. If we had a vote 
on that concept, we would get 90 votes. 
So what is frustrating is that in the 
desire to get aid and bullets and help 
into the Ukraine, we left out two provi-
sions: state sponsor of terrorism and 
permissions to go after the ill-gotten 
gains of the Russian oligarchs and plow 
it into Ukraine to help them. 
But what I want you to know is that 
the process did not accommodate these 
two provisions. But as you can tell 
from this discussion, we are not going 
to stop. To my colleagues in this body, 
we are not going to stop. Everybody is 
going to stand up one way or the other 
here pretty soon. 
I have talked to the Speaker of the 
House. She is very sympathetic to the 
idea about Russia being a state sponsor 
of terrorism. I will talk to KEVIN 
MCCARTHY. I think the bipartisanship 
here exists in the House. You should 
see it. 
So just finally, Senator WHITEHOUSE, 
can he assure the people of Ukraine, 
can he assure the oligarchs, can he as-
sure Putin, that we are not going to 
stop? 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I can, indeed, 
Senator GRAHAM. I can, indeed. And I 
thank him for his persistent effort on 
this, and I thank our colleagues in the 
House who have been very persistent 
on this, none more than Congressman 
MALINOWSKI of New Jersey.

MORNING BUSINESS 
ARREST AND DETENTION OF 
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, 1 month 
ago, 
Russian 
authorities 
arrested 
Vladimir Kara-Murza, a tireless advo-
cate for a democratic Russia and long-
time Putin critic, on the street near 
his apartment in Moscow. While he was 
in detention for a fabricated adminis-
trative violation, they charged him 
further with ‘‘spreading deliberately 
false information’’ about the armed 
forces 
of 
Russia, 
which 
was 
criminalized 
under 
a 
Russian 
law 
passed after the full-scale invasion of 
Ukraine. He is currently in pretrial de-
tention and could face up to 15 years in 
prison if convicted. 
Vladimir is a friend and frequent vis-
itor to the offices of many Members of 
Congress, myself included. His wife and 
children live in Virginia, and he splits 
his time between the United States and 
Russia, where he was born and raised. 
Vladimir has a special relationship 
with the Helsinki Commission and a 
keen interest in using parliamentary 
diplomacy 
to 
rally 
other 
nations 
against the Putin regime’s undemo-
cratic and violent policies, particularly 
the war in Ukraine. 
Vladimir was instrumental in the de-
velopment 
and 
passage 
of 
the 
Magnitsky Act. In fact, a number of 
colleagues and I recently sent a letter 
to President Biden urging that the ad-
ministration impose Magnitsky Act 
sanctions on every Russian official and 
associate involved in Vladimir’s false 
arrest and unjust detention. 
That Vladimir continues to return to 
Russia after multiple poisonings, ar-
rests, and other tribulations is a testa-
ment to his profound courage and dedi-
cation to his fellow citizens. He feels 
that he cannot, in good conscience, call 
on Russians to risk their freedom and 
lives to resist the evils and compla-
cency of Putin’s Russia if he is com-
fortably out of harm’s way himself. 
Two weeks before his arrest, Vladi-
mir testified at a Helsinki Commission 
hearing on propaganda and censorship 
in Russia, where he warned that speak-
ing out against the war in Ukraine is 
now grounds for prosecution in Russia, 
yet he refused to be silent. 
Though now deprived of his physical 
freedom and in grave danger, Vladi-
mir’s spirit is unbroken; he is unafraid; 
and he continues to believe that Russia 
will one day become a democratic, Eu-
ropean state. He sees the Ukraine war 
as the last desperate gasp of Putinism, 
the beginning of the end. 
In our many meetings over the years, 
Vladimir has always reminded us of the 
need to remember prisoners of con-
science and speak their names. As 
Vladimir now ranks among these hun-
dreds 
in 
Russia, 
and 
even 
more 
throughout the rest of the world, we 
will remember him. I call upon my col-
leagues to do the same; there is hope 
and power in not being forgotten. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the letter to President Biden 
that I referred to a moment ago be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
MAY 5, 2022. 
President JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., 
The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN: We urge you to 
name and sanction every Russian official and 
associate involved with the false arrest, de-
tention, and political persecution of Vladi-
mir Kara-Murza. Kara-Murza is a Russian 
opposition politician who has long stood up 
against Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. He 
embodies what Russia might be one day 
when it is democratic and free. We also urge 
you to examine whether to sanction those 
involved in the persecution and imprison-
ment of other Russian political prisoners. 
Kara-Murza is a Russian patriot who has 
fought for decades for democracy in Russia 
and a prosperous future for his country. For 
this, the regime in Russia has poisoned him 
twice. On April 11, while in Russia, Kara- 
Murza called this regime ‘‘a regime of mur-
derers.’’ He was then arrested, and now faces 
trumped up charges that may result in years 
of unjust imprisonment. 
Kara-Murza was the key Russian activist 
behind the passage of the Magnitsky Act and 
its adoption by our allies. The late Senator 
John McCain called him ‘‘one of the most 
passionate and effective advocates for the 
passage of the Magnitsky Act.’’ Kara-Murza 
himself, like his mentor Boris Nemtsov be-
fore him, has called the Magnitsky Act the 
most ‘‘pro-Russian law passed in the United 
States in the history of our countries.’’ 
Nemtsov was murdered in front of the Krem-
lin. 
The Magnitsky Act is the appropriate tool 
to sanction those involved in the persecution 
of Kara-Murza. We ask that you coordinate 
with our allies to sanction these individuals 
at the same time. The European Union, the 
United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia now 
all have Magnitsky sanctions laws of their 
own. 
As Russia loses its brutal war of aggression 
against Ukraine, we must consider what 
might come next in that country. Kara- 
Murza offers a vision of a Russia free from 
imperialist kleptocracy. He has bravely an-
swered the call of many Ukrainians for Rus-
sians to take a stand and oppose this bloody

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, this 
week, our Nation observes National Po-
lice Week, a time when we pay tribute 
to our brave law enforcement officers 
and honor those who died in the line of 
duty. 
Over the course of this week, Ameri-
cans will come together to pay tribute 
to the 619 officers who gave their lives 
in the line of duty last year. Among 
them, six brave officers from Kansas 
will be memorialized on the National 
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in 
Washington, DC. 
Thousands travel to our Nation’s 
Capital to honor those who have paid 
the ultimate sacrifice during this cere-
mony, and back home, Kansans will 
gather to honor the men and women 
who put on a uniform each day to pro-
tect the communities we call home. 
One officer Kansans will gather to 
pay tribute to next week is Captain 
Clay Germany of the Wichita Police 
Department. Captain Germany was a 
U.S. Navy veteran and started his law 
enforcement career serving with the 
Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office and 
the Midwest City Police Department. 
He then dedicated 27 years to serving 
with the Wichita Police Department 
and, throughout his time, served as po-
lice officer, detective, sergeant, lieu-
tenant, and captain. 
Captain Germany earned a reputa-
tion for being a trusted leader and 
mentor within the community and in 
the department, always willing to lend 
a helping hand. On behalf of Kansas, I 
want to express my gratitude for his 
service. Captain Germany’s dedication 
helped make Wichita a better and safer 
community. 
I also want to recognize Wichita Po-
lice Department Officer Kyle Mellard, 
who was shot when responding to a 
welfare check in June of last year. 
After fighting for his life, Officer 
Mellard is able to walk again, a recov-
ery that his fellow officers call a mir-
acle. Despite his severe injuries, when 
talking about his recovery, Officer 
Mellard made his goal clear: to get 
back to work as an officer as soon as 
possible. 
All too often, we forget about the 
many important roles that our police 
officers have within our communities. 
This extends beyond relationships be-
tween police officers and individual 
residents. It is about the relationships 
between law enforcement and key in-
stitutions in our communities, such as 
churches, hospitals, schools, and busi-
nesses. 
During Police Week, we honor those 
we have lost, but we also remember the 
families they left behind. May God 
comfort them in their time of grief and 
be a source of strength for them. 
May God bless our law enforcement 
officers and protect them from harm as 
they faithfully perform their duties 
each and every day. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, 
every single day, law enforcement offi-
cers across the Nation put on a badge 
and leave for work to protect and serve 
our families and communities, not 
knowing if they will return to their 
own. Whether it be by ensuring safety 
on our roadways or responding to life- 
or-death crises, these brave men and 
women consistently honor their solemn 
oath in safeguarding the people of this 
blessed Nation. 
As we commemorate 2022 National 
Law Enforcement Week, we offer spe-
cial honors for the 619 officers our Na-
tion lost last year in the line of duty, 
sadly including officers from Mis-
sissippi. This week is dedicated to re-
membering their ultimate sacrifice, 
which is dearly felt by loved ones, 
friends, and entire communities. 
Law enforcement officers have re-
mained steadfast in their commitment 
to serve, even when faced with harsh, 
unfair criticism, scrutiny, and limited 
resources. Their ability to carry out 
their already stressful duties in such a 
challenging and sometimes hostile en-
vironment is remarkable. 
I want to make it known to all the 
law enforcement officers across the 
State of Mississippi and around the 
country that I greatly admire you for 
your rock solid tenacity and loyalty 
throughout such challenges. I will con-
tinue to work to ensure you have what 
you need to do your job. 
These officers, who are truly home-
town heroes, are strongholds in our 
communities, and the loss of any offi-
cer is deeply felt by all. This Police 
Week, we honor and mourn five heroes 
from Mississippi, officers who died in 
the line of duty in 2021. 
Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol 
Trooper John Martin Harris, 44, died on 
May 28, 2021, after a vehicle struck him 
during a traffic stop. Harris’ childhood 
dream was to be a policeman and serve 
his community. Having earned two 
Purple Hearts throughout his 24-year 
law enforcement career is a testament 
to his dedication, bravery, and selfless-
ness. He leaves behind his wife and his 
two children. 
Jefferson Davis County Deputy Sher-
iff Thomas Patrick ‘‘Pat’’ Barnes, 50, 
lost his life on April 10, 2021, after he 
sustained injuries in a single vehicle 
car crash while responding to a call for 
assistance 
from 
another 
agency. 
Barnes’ passion for law enforcement 
began while working in security. He 
joined and graduated from the police 
academy in 2017 and began his career 
with Jefferson Davis County Sheriff’s 
department 
shortly 
thereafter. 
He 
leaves behind his wife, four children, 
and his grandchildren. 
Hancock County Lieutenant Michael 
Anthony Boutte, Sr., was tragically 
shot and killed after responding to an 
emergency situation involving a suici-
dal man who turned his weapon onto 
arriving deputies. He died on February 
1, 2021, at the age of 57. Before his law 
enforcement career, Boutte served in 
the U.S. Air Force, where he was de-
ployed during Operation Desert Storm. 
Boutte is survived by his wife, his 
child, his step-children, and his grand-
children. 
Deputy 
Sheriff 
Bobby 
Daffin 
of 
George County Sheriff’s Office passed 
away August 12, 2021, following a battle 
with COVID–19. He was 37 years old. 
Daffin served his community for 14 
years and had recently served as a nar-
cotics agent for the Southeast Mis-
sissippi 
Narcotics 
Task 
Force. 
He 
leaves behind a young daughter. 
Hinds County Sheriff Lee D. Vance, 
63, lost his life from cardiorespiratory 
failure as a result of COVID–19 on Au-
gust 3, 2021. Vance, who has always had 
a love for the city of Jackson, served as 
Jackson police chief from 2014–2017 and 
was later elected Hinds County Sheriff 
in 2019. He leaves behind four daugh-
ters, a son, and numerous grand-
children. 
We also honor the lives of many offi-
cers, whose stories of sacrifice had been 
lost to history until now. 
In addition to these recent losses, the 
National Law Enforcement Officers 
Memorial will include the name of Dep-
uty Town Marshal Walker Cobb of Sau-
cier, MS. At the age of 41, Cobb was fa-
tally shot on December 25, 1903, while 
attempting to arrest an impaired sus-
pect for disorderly conduct. More than 
a century later, his loss and sacrifice 
will be remembered. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, our 
men and women in blue have often 
risked personal peril to safeguard their 
fellow citizens, and we owe them our 
staunch support. As we mark National 
Police Week, let us acknowledge our 
debt to these fallen officers and recom-
mit ourselves to support them and 
their families, especially when tragedy 
strikes. 
I will continue to be an advocate for 
law enforcement professionals and do 
all I can to honor the legacy of those 
lost in the line of duty. 
To the families and loved ones of our 
fallen Mississippi law enforcement offi-
cers, I know you have faced enormous 
loss. It is said, ‘‘The Lord is near to the 
brokenhearted and saves the crushed in 
spirit.’’ Please know that it is my 
prayer that the Lord stays near you 
during your time of grief. God bless 
you, and God bless our men and women 
in blue.

RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN AM-
BULANCE ASSOCIATION’S STARS 
OF LIFE 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the American Ambu-
lance Association’s ‘‘Stars of Life’’ re-
cipients from Arkansas. I am proud to 
recognize these noble Americans who 
are always there to help those in need. 
The emergency medical technicians, 
paramedics, dispatchers, and other am-
bulance service providers deserve ap-
plause and appreciation for their com-
mitment and selflessness. The ‘‘Stars 
of Life’’ program celebrates the dedica-
tion, service, and heroism of ambu-
lance professionals who have gone be-
yond the call of duty on behalf of their 
communities and the emergency med-
ical services profession. This initiative 
honors them and their significant con-
tributions, while also raising aware-
ness of the vital role EMS personnel 
play in our society and healthcare in-
frastructure. 
I am especially proud of the six 
‘‘Stars of Life’’ from Arkansas: Devin 
Holland, 
Kenneth 
Jenkins, 
Randy 
Murry, Amanda Nesbitt, Alvin Short, 
and Benny Ford. 
Each of these individuals has devoted 
themselves to serving others by pro-
viding vital 9–1-1 emergency care in 
their communities. These dedicated 
public servants have used their skills 
and training for the good of others, 
both on duty and off duty. They exem-
plify the mission of their profession 
and consistently promote public health 
and safety. 
Our State’s recipients, like those 
throughout the country, were nomi-
nated for this honor by their peers and 
administrators because of their self-
lessness, commitment to the job, posi-
tive influence, and ‘‘service before self’’ 
philosophy. Their work ethic and serv-
ice are described as contagious and 
commendable. Thousands of lives have 
been touched and even saved by these 
Stars of Life. Their work continues to 
better communities nationwide and 
impact emergency medical services 
positively. 
I am so grateful for these Arkansans, 
whose dedication to their communities 
is admirable as they make an unques-
tionable difference in the lives of those 
around them. They are an amazing ex-
ample of heroism and service in action, 
and Natural State residents are blessed 
to have their help in a time of need.

TRIBUTE TO RICHARD BRYAN 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I am hon-
ored and humbled to congratulate 
former Nevada Governor and U.S. Sen-
ator Richard Bryan on his retirement 
last month from Fennemore Craig. A 
dedicated public servant and champion 
for Nevada, Senator Bryan spent over 
half a century advocating for others, 
serving in just about every position in 
government, from the Nevada Senate 
to the Governor’s mansion to the U.S. 
Senate. Throughout his extensive and 
storied career, Senator Bryan always 
put Nevadans first. As the person with 
the privilege to serve in his Senate seat 
today, I think frequently about Sen-
ator Bryan’s steady, unwavering lead-
ership, and his pragmatic approach to 
addressing issues that mattered most 
to the people of Nevada. 
To note only a few of Senator Bry-
an’s incredible accomplishments would 
be a disservice to his long history of 
achievements for the public good, but I 
will do my best. As a young man, Sen-
ator Bryan served his country in the 
U.S. Army, the Las Vegas community 
as a prosecutor, and later Clark County 
as its first—and youngest—public de-
fender. Young Richard Bryan showed 
Nevada’s youth that anything is pos-
sible when you are dedicated and deter-
mined. Later, he served as Nevada’s 
27th attorney general, and as Governor 
of Nevada, Senator Bryan helped shape 
our State during a pivotal time in its 
history, helping Nevada attract the 
best and brightest, inviting businesses 
of all different sectors and sizes, to call 
Nevada home. 
As a U.S. Senator for two terms, Sen-
ator Bryan never stopped fighting to 
protect Nevada’s natural beauty. He 
stood up for policies that safeguarded 
our public lands, leading the charge for 
passage of the Southern Nevada Public 
Lands Management Act of 1998, which 
to this day makes land and resources 
available for various public purposes to 
better the communities in our State. I 
also want to recognize Senator Bryan 
and the late Senator Harry Reid for 
being the leading voices in the fight 
against Yucca Mountain, standing up 
for Nevadans and against our State be-
coming the Nation’s nuclear dumping 
ground. During his time in the Senate, 
Senator Bryan also worked tirelessly 
to 
advance 
civil 
rights, 
empower 
women in government, make our roads 
safer, and protect consumers from 
fraud. As a senior member of the Sen-
ate Commerce Committee, Senator 
Bryan was the lead sponsor of seven 
consumer protection and highway safe-
ty bills that passed the Senate. And as 
chair of the Senate Ethics Committee, 
Senator Bryan demonstrated his com-
mitment to the notion that public 
servants should fight for the interests 
of their constituents, not their own in-
terests. 
Senator Bryan has been beloved his 
entire career—by his staff, by his con-
stituents, and by his late wife Bonnie, 
who was the light of his life and stood 
by his side throughout Senator Bryan’s 
public life, serving Nevada with poise 
and grace. Those who worked for Sen-
ator Bryan remember him as the kind 
of boss who made everyone feel like an 
integral part of the team, from the 
chief of staff, down to new interns. 
That is why they have stayed close 
with one another and with him ever 
since Senator Bryan left the Senate in 
2000. 
Nevadans will forever be indebted to 
Senator Richard Bryan for his many 
selfless years of public service. I, per-
sonally, will always be grateful to Sen-
ator Bryan for his care, his compas-
sion, and his kindness, particularly 
when I first joined the Senate to re-
store the Richard Bryan seat to a Dem-
ocrat for the first time since he held it. 
I will never forget Senator Bryan walk-
ing me down the center aisle of the 
Senate Chamber, arm-in-arm, as I was 
sworn in to represent the people of Ne-
vada, just as he had done decades ear-
lier. I know I am a better Senator be-
cause of Senator Richard Bryan, I 
know we as a State and a nation are 
better off for his tremendous efforts, 
and I wish him all the best as he enters 
a well-deserved retirement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DAN CNOSSEN 
∑ Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, last 
week, leaders across Washington have 
gathered to celebrate our Team USA 
Olympic and Paralympic athletes dur-
ing the 2022 Winter Games. In that 
spirit, today, I want to both recognize 
and 
congratulate 
Lieutenant 
Com-
mander and Kansan Dan Cnossen on his 
recent gold medal victory for the 
United States in the mixed relay cross- 
country event at the 2022 Paralympic 
Winter Games. 
While this accomplishment itself is 
worthy of our praise, it is Dan’s jour-
ney leading up to this remarkable 
achievement that renders this feat all 
the more outstanding and commend-
able. 
A fifth-generation Kansas farm kid 
and graduate of Shawnee Heights High 
School in Tecumseh, Dan attended the 
U.S. Naval Academy, completing the 
rigorous and physically excruciating 
BUD/S program to commission as a 
Navy SEAL. He reached the rank of 
lieutenant commander and was serving 
as a platoon commander for Seal Team 
ONE in Afghanistan where his life was 
forever changed as a result of his serv-
ice to our Nation. 
In September of 2009, Lieutenant 
Commander Cnossen was severely in-
jured when he stepped on an IED in 
Kandahar, Afghanistan. He was 29 
years old. He woke up 8 days later to 
learn that both of his legs had been 
amputated just above the knee. 
Imagine that. Imagine waking up 
back in the U.S. to realize the life you 
always knew and the future you had 
envisioned had changed forever. Imag-
ine being one of the most physically 
and mentally advanced soldiers, only 
to have that change in an instant—be-
cause of one single step. 
Despite the extent of his injuries and 
though his life had changed forever, 
Dan did not give up. Or, as his fellow 
SEALS would say, he never ‘‘rang the 
bell.’’ Dan relearned how to walk with 
new and unfamiliar prosthetic legs and 
attacked every opportunity in life with 
vigor and determination. But the road 
was long, and it was never steady. Not 
giving up was a choice that had to be 
made each moment of each day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2490 
May 12, 2022 
In a moving article from the Wash-
ington Post that covers Cnossen’s jour-
ney, 
author 
Dave 
Sheinin 
writes: 
‘‘What pulled him through was the 
same brick-by-brick mentality that 
had gotten him through Hell Week 
years earlier and the first few weeks 
after the injury, as well as a relentless 
positivity that had allowed him to con-
vince himself that was a winning strat-
egy.’’ 
Following his injury, Dan excelled as 
an athlete because of this exception-
ally tough mental fortitude, winning 
seven Paralympic medals, including 
two gold medals, over three Winter 
Games. 
Lieutenant 
Commander 
Cnossen’s success during his service 
and in this next chapter in athletics is 
more than worthy of our praise and 
serves as a reminder to each of us the 
sacrifice of our veterans as well as sets 
an example for overcoming adversity 
in our lives. 
Dan himself said, ‘‘You learn during 
Hell Week that whatever you thought 
your limits were, they’re actually fur-
ther away than that.’’ 
Lieutenant 
Commander 
Cnossen’s 
journey has been an inspiration to me 
and to Kansans and continues to in-
spire athletes everywhere. 
I extend the warmest congratulations 
to him on his outstanding performance 
at the 2022 Paralympic Winter Games, 
and wish him the very best in his fu-
ture endeavors.∑

RECOGNIZING FLOREK FAMILY 
CHIROPRACTIC 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week, I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Florek Fam-
ily Chiropractic of Ft. Thomas, KY, as 
the Senate Small Business of the Week. 
Take a look at any small business 
owner’s story, and you will find a com-
mon theme: determination in the face 
of risk. Thus proceeds the story of 
Florek Family Chiropractic. Justin 
Florek, owner and manager of the 
chiropractic office, went out on a limb 
in 2019 and opened his own chiropractic 
office after spending several years 
working in a larger chiropractor’s of-
fice in Falmouth. However, the story 
would be incomplete without the men-
tion of Justin’s wife Samantha, who 
took out a small business loan and 
joined him in facing down the odds to 
embark on this new venture. Together, 
Justin, Samantha, and the rest of the 
team at Florek Family Chiropractic 
weathered the storm of the COVID–19 
pandemic only 1 year after opening 
their doors, and today, they continue 
to proudly service the residents of Ft. 
Thomas and wider Campbell County. 
Justin Florek has long been pas-
sionate about the body’s health and 
wellness. In fact, Justin first became 
interested in the chiropractic field as 
far back as ninth grade. A school as-
signment required each student to 
shadow three different occupations and 
write a paper on their findings. A teen-
age Justin shadowed a police officer, a 
baker, and a chiropractor. While shad-
owing the chiropractor, Justin saw how 
chiropractic adjustments were able to 
help those struggling with unaddressed 
injuries. Just having recently suffered 
a football injury himself, Justin appre-
ciated 
how 
much 
a 
chiropractor’s 
touch and advice would have benefited 
someone in his own position. Thus 
what started as a school assignment 
led to a life-long career choice. 
After graduating from Logan College 
of Chiropractic in 2014, Justin set out 
to join a larger practice to offer his 
services to the community of Fal-
mouth. To this day, Justin is pro-
foundly grateful to the Falmouth com-
munity for the 5 years he spent in of-
fice honing in on his skills and trade 
before deciding to take the big leap and 
open his own shop. From Falmouth, 
Justin ventured north towards the 
Ohio border to settle in Ft. Thomas. In 
a convenient turn of events, Justin and 
his wife Samantha identified an afford-
able piece of property for sale that was 
perfectly located between Bellevue, 
Newport, Cold Spring, and Highland 
Heights. This lucky opportunity led to 
their venture in small business owner-
ship, which proudly stands today as a 
testament to their hard work and de-
termination. 
As 
previously 
mentioned, 
Justin 
takes a genuine interest in the health 
and well-being of those around him. He 
remains dedicated to improving the 
health of others and serves as one of 
the few chiropractors in Campbell 
County that accepts Medicaid pay-
ments. Justin takes pride in ensuring 
that all residents are cared for, regard-
less of their tax bracket. Moreover, he 
looks out for his community beyond 
just providing his chiropractic serv-
ices. He often donates to northern Ken-
tucky school groups and other local 
fundraisers; after all, he does owe the 
inspiration for his livelihood to that 
long-ago school assignment. Justin is a 
man who not only cares for the com-
munity in a medical sense, but also is 
a man who bolsters the environment 
with his good cheer and giving nature. 
I want to congratulate this upstand-
ing entrepreneur for the dedication and 
grit he displayed throughout the pan-
demic and for navigating the uncharted 
terrain involved in owning your own 
business. I wish Justin and Samantha 
the best of luck and look forward to 
seeing their continued growth and suc-
cess in Kentucky.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13873 OF MAY 15, 2019, WITH RE-
SPECT TO SECURING THE INFOR-
MATION AND COMMUNICATIONS 
TECHNOLOGY 
AND 
SERVICES 
SUPPLY TO CHINA—PM 31 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13873 of May 15, 2019, with respect 
to securing the information and com-
munications technology and services 
supply chain, is to continue in effect 
beyond May 15, 2022. 
The unrestricted acquisition or use 
in the United States of information 
and communications technology or 
services designed, developed, manufac-
tured, or supplied by persons owned by, 
controlled by, or subject to the juris-
diction or direction of foreign adver-
saries augments the ability of these 
foreign adversaries to create and ex-
ploit vulnerabilities in information and 
communications technology or serv-
ices, with potentially catastrophic ef-
fects. This threat continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13873 with respect to securing the infor-
mation 
and 
communications 
tech-
nology and services supply chain.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–138. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Wisconsin recog-
nizing the importance of oil and natural gas 
pipelines for Wisconsin and its economy; to 
the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 90 
Whereas, the State of Wisconsin relies on, 
and will continue to rely on for many years, 
natural gas, gasoline, diesel jet fuel, and 
other products, and in order to fuel our econ-
omy, the State of Wisconsin will need more 
natural gas and oil while also requiring addi-
tional alternative enrgy sources; and 
Whereas, pipelines transport energy safely 
through energy highways, taking natural 
gas, oil, and petroleum products over vast 
distances from often remote locations to the 
populated places where we need the products; 
and 
Whereas, 97 percent of the Canadian nat-
ural gas and oil used in the United States is 
delivered by pipelines, and in the U.S., pipe-
lines deliver 66 percent of crude oil and re-
fined products and almost all natural gas; 
and 
Whereas, Wisconsin’s agriculture industry 
is an economic driver, contributing $104.8 bil-
lion annually to the state’s economy in 2017 
and supporting 435,700 jobs, 11.8 percent of 
the state’s employment; over half of the di-
rect energy used in crop and livestock pro-
duction comes from distillate fuel; and in 
2019, Wisconsin farmers consumed over 113 
million gallons of distillate fuel; and 
Whereas, Wisconsin’s agriculture industry 
also depends on petroleum fuels to transport

agricultural goods from farm to processor to 
market, with Wisconsin exporting more than 
$3.37 billion of agricultural and food products 
in 2020 to 145 countries; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the senate, the assembly concur-
ring, That the members of the Wisconsin 
State Legislature support continued and in-
creased development and delivery of oil de-
rived from North American oil reserves to 
American refineries; and, be it further 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the legisla-
ture that everything should be done to sup-
port continued and increased development 
and delivery of oil from Canada to the 
United States and support the development, 
maintenance and operation of pipelines in 
the United States to ensure America’s en-
ergy independence, improve our national se-
curity and enhance global stability, reduce 
consumer energy costs, create new jobs, and 
strengthen ties between the United States 
and Canada; and, be it further 
Resolved, That the chief clerk of the senate 
is hereby directed to transmit duly authenti-
cated copies of this resolution to the Speak-
er and Clerk of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the President Pro Tempore and Sec-
retary of the U.S. Senate, the members of 
the Wisconsin congressional delegation, and 
to the news media of Wisconsin. 
POM–139. A joint resolution adopted by the 
General Assembly of the State of Tennessee 
urging the President of the United States 
and the United States Congress to utilize all 
available options to effect the full removal 
of 
Russian 
financial 
institutions 
from 
SWIFT as an appropriate and effective sanc-
tion against against Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine; to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 1147 
Whereas, Russia’s heinous, unprovoked in-
vasion of Ukraine has brought death and de-
spair to the Ukrainian people and threatened 
the peace and security of Europe; and 
Whereas, many Western nations, including 
the United States, have imposed sanctions 
against Russian banks, but in the face of this 
blatant warmongering, the ‘‘nuclear option’’ 
of banking, the full removal of Russian 
banks from international finance infrastruc-
ture, should be invoked; and 
Whereas, the Society for Worldwide Inter-
bank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) 
was founded in 1973 to replace the telex and 
is now used by more than 11,000 financial in-
stitutions to send secure messages and pay-
ment orders; because there is no globally ac-
cepted alternative, SWIFT is essential infra-
structure for global finance; and 
Whereas, 
fully 
removing 
Russia 
from 
SWIFT would make it nearly impossible for 
financial institutions to transfer money in 
or out of the country, delivering a sudden 
shock to Russian companies and their for-
eign customers, especially buyers of oil and 
gas exports denominated in U.S. dollars; and 
Whereas, according to experts, fully ex-
cluding Russia from SWIFT would terminate 
all international transactions, trigger cur-
rency volatility, cause massive capital out-
flows, and result in the Russian economy 
shrinking by an estimated five percent; and 
Whereas, there is precedent for banning 
from SWIFT a nation that has thumbed its 
nose at the European Union; Iranian banks 
were disconnected from SWIFT in 2012 after 
they were sanctioned by the European Union 
over the country’s nuclear program; and 
Whereas, the efficacy of such sanctions was 
proven when Iran lost almost half of its oil 
export revenue and thirty percent of its for-
eign trade following the disconnection; and 
Whereas, the Foreign Minister of Ukraine 
has urged that Russia be banned from 
SWIFT, and we agree that this is an appro-
priate response to the nation’s cynical at-
tack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and the future 
peace and prosperity of Europe and all of 
Western democracy; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred 
Twelfth General Assembly of the State of Ten-
nessee, the House of Representatives Concur-
ring, That we urge and encourage President 
Biden and the United States Congress to uti-
lize all available options to effect the full re-
moval of Russian financial institutions from 
SWIFT as an appropriate and effective sanc-
tion against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Be 
it further 
Resolved, that we urge and encourage 
President Biden to immediately expel from 
the United States all Russian diplomatic 
personnel. Be it further 
Resolved, that we urge and encourage 
President Biden and the United States Con-
gress to immediately ban all imports from 
Russia. Be it further 
Resolved, that a certified copy of this reso-
lution be transmitted to the President of the 
United States; the Speaker and the Clerk of 
the U.S. House of Representatives; the Presi-
dent and the Secretary of the U.S. Senate; 
and each member of Tennessee’s Congres-
sional delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. CARPER (for himself and 
Mrs. CAPITO): 
S. 4194. A bill to amend the Fish and 
Wildlife Act of 1956 to reauthorize the 
volunteer services, community part-
nership, and refuge education programs 
of the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, Senator 
CAPITO and I are introducing legisla-
tion today to reauthorize appropria-
tions for the National Wildlife Refuge 
System’s volunteer and partnerships 
program. I want to share with our col-
leagues some information about the 
Keep America’s Refuges Operational 
Act and ask for their support. 
The Keep America’s Refuges Oper-
ational Act reauthorizes the volunteer 
and partnerships program, with no in-
crease, at $2 million per year. The U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service uses the mod-
est Federal funding it receives for this 
program to leverage volunteer con-
tributions 
by 
providing 
uniforms, 
training, equipment, and necessary 
travel. 
Our National Wildlife Refuge System 
is an exceptional network of more than 
850 acres of public lands and waters 
dedicated to fish and wildlife conserva-
tion. Tens of millions of people visit 
our refuges each year to explore, fish, 
hunt, and view and study wildlife. This 
ecotourism 
strongly 
supports 
local 
economies. During the pandemic in 
particular, our national lands, includ-
ing refuges, were safe outdoor spaces 
for recreation. 
Volunteers are critical to refuge op-
erations. They assist with fish and 
wildlife surveys, restoring habitat, and 
supporting 
refuge 
office 
functions. 
Without volunteers and partner groups, 
refuges would likely have to cut back 
on public programs and reduce hours of 
operation. 
In my home State of Delaware, we 
have two beautiful refuges—the Prime 
Hook National Wildlife Refuge and the 
Bombay Hook National Wildlife Ref-
uge. Both refuges are highly dependent 
upon volunteers. 
Each year, people come to our ref-
uges to observe the federally threat-
ened red knot shorebird, which stops 
along the Delaware Bay to refuel on 
horseshoe crab eggs along its migra-
tion journey. Volunteers make sure 
these visitors have memorable experi-
ences. 
When people can see these pristine 
habitats and the many species that call 
them home, they are inspired to be 
good stewards of our planet for the en-
joyment and benefit of future genera-
tions. 
I want to ensure that these opportu-
nities opportunities abound in Dela-
ware and around the country. A small 
annual investment in the refuge sys-
tem volunteer and partnerships pro-
gram goes a long way. Every $1 appro-
priated to coordinate these volunteers 
translates to approximately $10 worth 
of volunteer services. 
These appropriations also help cut 
government costs. In fiscal year 2021, 
more than 11,000 volunteers donated 
68,879 hours, with donated time equal-
ing that of 318 full-time employees. The 
value of this time contribution is about 
$18.5 million. 
I want to thank Senator CAPITO for 
cosponsoring this commonsense legis-
lation. I look forward to working with 
her and our colleagues in the House to 
pass the Keep America’s Refuges Oper-
ational Act and enact it into law. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
MARKEY, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. WAR-
NER, 
Mr. 
MORAN, 
and 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ): 
S. 4202. A bill to require an annual 
budget estimate for the initiatives of 
the National Institutes of Health pur-
suant to reports and recommendations 
made under the National Alzheimer’s 
Project Act; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
WARNER, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. MAR-
KEY, 
Mr. 
MORAN, 
and 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ): 
S. 4203. A bill to extend the National 
Alzheimer’s Project; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce two bills aimed at 
continuing the important progress we 
have made so far to prevent and effec-
tively treat Alzheimer’s disease. I 
know how devastating this disease is. 
My father, grandfather, and two uncles 
all died from Alzheimer’s. I am com-
mitted to this effort both as a person 
whose beloved family members have 
suffered from this disease as well as a 
Senator concerned about the impact on 
our families and our healthcare budg-
ets. 
When I founded the Congressional 
Alzheimer’s Task Force in the Senate 
in 1999, there was virtually no focus on 
Alzheimer’s in Washington. Twelve 
years ago, I coauthored the bipartisan 
National Alzheimer’s Project Act with 
my colleague Senator Evan Bayh. Be-
fore we passed that legislation, there 
was no coordinated, strategic national 
plan to focus our efforts to defeat Alz-
heimer’s and ensure that our resources 
are maximized and leveraged. NAPA

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2495 
May 12, 2022 
fixed this by convening a panel of ex-
perts to create a coordinated strategic 
national plan to prevent and effec-
tively treat Alzheimer’s disease by 
2025. The expert council updates the 
plan annually. 
We have made some progress in our 
efforts to find a treatment, means of 
prevention, or cure, but Alzheimer’s 
still costs our Nation an astonishing 
$321 billion per year, including $206 bil-
lion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. 
If we continue along this trajectory, 
Alzheimer’s is projected to claim the 
minds of 12.7 million seniors and nearly 
surpass $1 trillion in annual costs by 
2050. It takes a tremendous toll on fam-
ilies, too. In 2021, family caregivers 
provided 16 billion hours of unpaid care 
for loved ones with dementia. That job 
is often 24/7 and often harms the health 
of the caregiver. 
The National Alzheimer’s Project 
Act is set to expire in 2025, so we need 
to reauthorize this critical legislation 
to make sure that our research invest-
ments remain coordinated, and we can 
maximize their impact. 
The first bill that I will introduce 
today with my colleagues Senators 
WARNER, CAPITO, MARKEY, MORAN, and 
MENENDEZ, is the NAPA Reauthoriza-
tion Act. It would reauthorize NAPA 
through 2035 and modernize the legisla-
tion to reflect strides we have made 
understanding the disease, like includ-
ing a new focus on promoting healthy 
aging and reducing risk factors. 
The second bill that I will introduce, 
with my colleagues Senators MARKEY, 
CAPITO, WARNER, MORAN, and MENEN-
DEZ, is the Alzheimer’s Accountability 
and Investment Act. That bill would 
continue through 2035 a requirement 
that the Director of the National Insti-
tutes of Health submit an annual budg-
et to Congress estimating the funding 
necessary for NIH to fully implement 
NAPA’s research goals. Only two other 
areas of biomedical research—cancer 
and HIV/AIDs—have been the subject of 
special budget development aimed at 
speeding discovery, and this ‘‘bypass 
budget,’’ as it is known, helps us to un-
derstand the additional funding needed 
to find better treatments, a means of 
prevention, and ultimately a cure for 
Alzheimer’s disease. 
Nearly half of baby boomers reaching 
age 85 will either be afflicted with Alz-
heimer’s or caring for someone who has 
it. In many ways, Alzheimer’s is the 
defining disease of this generation. We 
have made tremendous progress in re-
cent years to boost funding for Alz-
heimer’s research, which holds great 
promise to ending this disease that has 
had a devastating effect on millions of 
Americans and their families. The two 
bills I introduce today will maintain 
our momentum and make sure that we 
do not take our foot off the pedal just 
as our investments in basic research is 
beginning to translate into potential 
new treatments. We must not let Alz-
heimer’s define our children’s genera-
tion as it has ours. 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
COTTON, Mr. MARKEY, and Mr. 
HAGERTY): 
S. 4209. A bill to require a feasibility 
study regarding establishing new diplo-
matic posts in the Pacific Islands; to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Expanding 
America’s Pacific Diplomatic Presence 
Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation 
that seeks to deepen our diplomatic re-
lations with Pacific Island countries 
and territories. I am thankful to Sen-
ator COTTON, Senator MARKEY, and 
Senator HAGERTY for joining me in in-
troducing this legislation. 
The United States enjoys strong his-
torical ties, economic relationships, 
and cultural links with many Pacific 
Island nations. During World War II, 
these islands became the frontlines of 
some of our hardest fought battles of 
the Pacific campaign. Now, Pacific Is-
land nations and territories are at the 
frontlines 
of 
climate 
change. 
Our 
friendships with Pacific Island nations 
are deepened by generations of Pacific 
Islanders whose presence in the United 
States and contributions have enriched 
communities throughout our country. 
We also recognize the strategic impor-
tance of Pacific Island nations, as dem-
onstrated by the Compacts of Free As-
sociation we have with the Republic of 
the Marshall Islands, Federated States 
of Micronesia, and Palau. Unfortu-
nately, while our diplomatic presence 
in the region has waned in the last dec-
ade, the diplomatic and economic pres-
ence of the People’s Republic of China, 
PRC, has increased as it seeks to forge 
closer ties with Pacific Island nations. 
What happens in the Pacific Islands 
matters to the United States and we 
must take steps to demonstrate the 
strength of our commitment to the re-
gion. 
Diplomatic engagement in the region 
is critical for understanding how we 
can better support our Pacific Island 
partners. President Biden has worked 
to elevate the U.S.’s diplomatic en-
gagement by being the first U.S. Presi-
dent to participate in a gathering of 
the Pacific Island Forum leaders. The 
President also signaled his commit-
ment to the Freely Associated States 
by 
appointing 
Special 
Presidential 
Envoy Ambassador Joseph Yun to lead 
negotiations over the Compacts of Free 
Association. Several high-ranking ad-
ministration officials, including the 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, 
have visited the region to pledge U.S. 
support for efforts related to COVID–19 
response, climate change adaptation, 
maritime security, infrastructure de-
velopment, trade, and economic invest-
ment. I applaud this level of meaning-
ful diplomatic engagement in the re-
gion and would like to see this sus-
tained in the future. 
Establishing new U.S. diplomatic 
posts would support our efforts to build 
lasting relationships with Pacific Is-
land 
nations 
and 
territories. 
The 
United States currently has eight Em-
bassies among Pacific Island nations, 
with plans to reopen an Embassy in the 
Solomon Islands. These Embassies play 
an important role in forging relations 
with host nations and serve as impor-
tant symbols of the U.S.’s long term 
commitment to the region. Opening 
new embassies, consulate generals, or 
other diplomatic posts would allow 
U.S. diplomats to have more regular 
interactions with the governments of 
the Pacific Islands and learn more 
about the challenges and opportunities 
facing each nation. The year-round 
presence of more U.S. diplomats would 
improve our ability to compete with 
the PRC’s growing presence in the re-
gion and would enhance our coordina-
tion with Australia, New Zealand, and 
Japan on economic development assist-
ance and humanitarian aid. An ex-
panded diplomatic presence in the re-
gion would also improve oversight of 
U.S. Government-funded programs in 
the region. 
The legislation I am introducing 
would direct the Government Account-
ability Office, GAO, to conduct a feasi-
bility study on establishing new diplo-
matic posts in Pacific Island countries 
and territories that currently do not 
have a U.S. Embassy or other U.S. dip-
lomatic post. This legislation recog-
nizes and seeks to understand what po-
tential benefits and challenges may 
exist for establishing new U.S. diplo-
matic posts in the region. I hope that 
the results of an independent study 
conducted by GAO will inform future 
decisions by Congress and the execu-
tive branch to establish and appro-
priately fund new diplomatic posts in 
the region. 
I urge my colleagues to pass the Ex-
panding America’s Pacific Diplomatic 
Presence Act to demonstrate our sup-
port for greater diplomatic engage-
ment with our partners in the region 
and reaffirm our commitment to build-
ing a shared future with the people of 
the Pacific Islands.

May 12, 2022 
SENATE 
CONCURRENT 
RESOLU-
TION 39—HONORING THE 1,000,000 
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DIED 
FROM COVID–19 IN THE UNITED 
STATES 
Mr. SCHATZ (for himself and Mrs. 
MURRAY) submitted the following con-
current resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. CON. RES. 39 
Whereas, on May 12, 2022 the United States 
reached 1,000,000 confirmed lives lost due to 
COVID–19; 
Whereas the first laboratory-confirmed 
case of COVID–19 in the United States was 
recorded by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention on January 20, 2020; 
Whereas the first known death from 
COVID–19 in the United States occurred in 
February 2020; 
Whereas, in the months following the first 
recorded death, the COVID–19 pandemic has 
impacted individuals, families, and commu-
nities across the United States; 
Whereas estimates report that the death 
toll from COVID–19 has increased the num-
ber of orphans in the United States by nearly 
200,000 children; 
Whereas 
scientific 
breakthroughs 
have 
been effective at reducing the COVID–19 
death toll; and 
Whereas it is recognized that mitigation 
efforts can reduce the number of deaths due 
to COVID–19 and save lives: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) recognizes and mourns the 1,000,000 
known lives lost in the United States due to 
COVID–19; and 
(2) honors the memory of the deceased and 
offers condolences to their families and loved 
ones.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE 
HONORABLE NORMAN Y. MINETA 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 11, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, California, 
the Congress and the Country are mourning 
the loss of a pioneering leader, a legendary 
statesman and a patriotic American: Secretary 
Norm Mineta. 
Thank you to Congresswoman JUDY CHU 
and the leadership of CAPAC, for hosting this 
Special Order. It is fitting that we pay tribute 
to their Co-Founder here on the House Floor, 
where he served for two decades. 
Over the course of his long, distinguished 
and barrier-breaking career, Norm Mineta was 
a man of many titles: 
An intelligence officer in the United States 
Army; 
Mayor of San Jose—the first Asian Amer-
ican mayor of a major city; 
Mr. Chairman here in the House—not only 
of the powerful Committee on Public Works & 
Transportation, but also a strong voice in the 
creation of CAPAC; 
and Mr. Secretary: the first Asian American 
to hold a Cabinet post—and he did so in not 
one, but two Administrations. 
But as Norm told us himself, there was one 
title he always held dearest. He said, quote: ‘‘I 
cherish the word citizen because my own gov-
ernment . . . wasn’t willing to use that word to 
describe us.’’ 
Indeed, all Americans are in awe of how— 
after enduring the cruelty of internment at just 
ten years old—Norm still chose to devote his 
life to serving the Nation that had turned its 
back on him. 
Norm’s lifelong public service will forever be 
remembered as a profound act of extraor-
dinary courage, grace & patriotism: fighting to 
correct injustice and ensure America’s found-
ing promise for all. 
Those of us who served with Norm in the 
House had the privilege of seeing this first-
hand in his relentless mission for justice with 
the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. 
He was the driving force behind this long- 
overdue law, in which the United States finally 
apologized for incarcerating Japanese Amer-
ican families like his own; and took a step to 
make amends for this stain on our Nation’s 
history. 
Who could forget Secretary Mineta’ s vision-
ary, tireless and patriotic leadership in the 
wake of the September Attacks—helping 
strengthen our Nation with the establishment 
of the TSA. 
Personally, I will miss my dear friend, Norm, 
who treated all fortunate enough to know him 
with sincere kindness, humanity and respect. 
And I join my fellow Californians in taking 
great pride in the fact that the San Jose Inter-
national Airport continues to bear his name. 
May it be a comfort to his loving wife, Deni, 
his sons David and Stuart, stepsons Robert 
and Mark, and his many grandchildren that a 
grateful Nation prays for them and mourns 
with them during this sad time. 
God blessed our Nation with the life and 
leadership of Norm Mineta. May he rest in 
peace.

CELEBRATING LUCILLE ‘‘LUCY’’ 
LEVY 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the 
100th birthday of Lucille ‘‘Lucy’’ Levy. 
Lucille ‘‘Lucy’’ Levy was born in New York 
City on May 12, 1922. Her family moved to 
Long Island where she grew up and graduated 
from Lawrence High School. Upon graduation, 
she went to work as a model in the New York 
City garment industry. She met and married 
her dashing husband, Daniel Herman in 1941. 
They had three daughters: Nan, Marsha, and 
Laura; and were married for 43 years before 
his passing. 
Lucy worked with her husband in the family 
retail business, Sandra Post, for many years. 
She was also involved in charitable causes in-
cluding Variety Children’s Hospital and Temple 
Beth Sholom. She married her second hus-
band, Irving Lovitt, and they were married for 
22 years until his death. 
As a centenarian, the history she has wit-
nessed over the past century is quite remark-
able. In her lifetime, 19 Presidents have 
served our nation, the global population has 
increased by nearly 6 billion people, and 
countless inventions from the airplane to the 
internet have launched us into a new techno-
logical era. 
Today, Lucy lives in Aventura, Florida and is 
keeping up with currents events, reading the 
newspaper cover to cover every day, and con-
tinues to be a devoted and loving mother, 
grandmother, and great-grandmother. Count-
less individuals have been touched by the 
richness of the stories and memories she has 
shared throughout the years. 
I join Lucy’s family and her Aventura com-
munity in wishing her a Happy 100th Birthday.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CAREER 
OF MAJOR SERGEANT HUNTER 
SORRELLS 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the career of retiring United 
States Marine Corps Master Sergeant Hunter 
Sorrells. 
During his time as a Marine Corps fellow in 
my office, Master Sergeant Sorrells served our 
men and women in uniform, along with the 
veteran community of Northeast Wisconsin, 
with 
the 
utmost 
dedication 
and 
profes-
sionalism. His intelligence, tenacity, and devo-
tion to helping others made him a beloved and 
invaluable member of my team. His relentless 
advocacy on behalf of Northeast Wisconsin 
veterans changed the lives of multiple individ-
uals in my district and delivered for them the 
benefits they earned in service of our Nation. 
There is no better example of Master Ser-
geant Sorrells’ dedication to his fellow men 
and women in uniform—particularly Marines— 
than his efforts to recover the Camp Reasoner 
base sign from Vietnam. After being informed 
of the issue, he dove into action and not only 
gathered bipartisan support, but expertly 
worked through the logistics that would be re-
quired to bring the sign home to American 
soil. Thanks to his perseverance, all Marines 
then serving in the House of Representatives 
signed onto a letter bringing the issue to the 
attention of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. 
Throughout his time in my office, Master Ser-
geant Sorrells exemplified the highest stand-
ards and values of the United States Marine 
Corps. I am privileged to have had the oppor-
tunity to work alongside this great American. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Master Sergeant Hunter Sorrells’ exem-
plary career in the Marine Corps and wishing 
him all the best in retirement. Our Nation is 
safer, and the Northeast Wisconsin community 
is better, because of his service.

years, to share with my colleagues another 
important milestone for the Philadelphia Or-
chestra on the world stage. 
In close coordination with the Department of 
State’s Bureau of Education and Cultural Af-
fairs as well as our diplomats in Abu Dhabi, a 
delegation from the Philadelphia Orchestra 
made a historic trip to the United Arab Emir-
ates in March. 
This coincided with the Dubai Expo and the 
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between the United States and the 
United Arab Emirates on March 20, 1972. 
The Philadelphia Orchestra has been one of 
the most well-traveled in the world. This com-
mitment to cultural diplomacy dates to the end 
of World War II. Colleagues will remember the 
landmark visit to China orchestrated person-
ally by President Nixon and Secretary Kis-
singer. More recently, the Orchestra has 
worked with our State Department diplomats 
to strengthen relations with countries as di-
verse as Mongolia and Israel. 
While on the ground, the musicians visited 
not only Abu Dhabi and Dubai, but also the 
Fujairah Fine Arts Academy. This was truly 
historic. In an increasingly complex world, this 
type of people-to-people exchange is an in-
credibly important tool to amplify the work of 
our diplomats. 
As we stand shoulder to shoulder with our 
European allies, I look forward to celebrating 
the upcoming European tour this August and 
September. Once again, the Philadelphia Or-
chestra will serve as an important cultural am-
bassador for our country on the world stage.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE PA 211 
NORTHEAST/HELP LINE FOR 50 
YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor the PA 211 Northeast/Help Line for 50 
years of service to Northeastern Pennsylvania 
in partnership with the Family Service Asso-
ciation. For the past five decades, the Help 
Line has been a source for anyone seeking 
referrals to social service and support agen-
cies or information in Northeastern Pennsyl-
vania. This occasion will be marked with a 
Spring Fling and Auction celebration on Thurs-
day, May 12, 2022 at the Westmoreland Club 
in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. 
In 1972, Hurricane Agnes and the resulting 
flood devastated the region, causing billions of 
dollars of damage and leaving citizens in need 
of food, shelter, and other necessities. In re-
sponse to this tragedy, the Wilkes-Barre City 
Demonstration Agency, the Department of 
Public Welfare, and the Wyoming Valley 
United Fund all came together to establish 
and provide financial support for the Wilkes- 
Barre Information System, later renamed PA 
211 Help Line, to provide vital information for 
the survivors of this disaster. They chose 
Family Service Association to operate the 
service. During the first year, 3,000 calls were 
answered regarding food, utility information, 
and transport services as the region slowly re-
covered from the flood. 
In 1975, after entering into agreements with 
several area agencies, the Help Line became 
a twenty-four-hour crisis hotline. Soon after, 
additional agencies signed on, and Help Line 
was now the crisis center for most Wyoming 
Valley social service agencies. 
While continuing to provide information and 
referrals, Help Line has also become a place 
to call when an individual needs someone to 
listen to them, and a team of crisis case-
workers is able to provide support and refer-
rals to additional services as needed. In 2011, 
Help Line, now operating under its current 
name, grew beyond an active listing of local 
agencies to include regional, state, and na-
tional resources 
Since 1972, Help Line has answered more 
than 3.1 million calls from its 17-county cov-
erage area and beyond. The team has re-
sponded to numerous disasters over the years 
such as the blizzard of 1993, the September 
11th terrorist attacks, and more recently the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Today, Help Line con-
tinues to grow and thrive. With one phone 
number, callers can freely obtain resources on 
how to access thousands of programs and 
services aiming to improve the quality of their 
lives. 
I am honored to congratulate the Family 
Service Association and PA 211 Northeast/ 
Help Line for 50 years of steadfast dedication 
to supporting the people of Northeastern 
Pennsylvania. I wish them great success in 
the future as they continue to provide essen-
tial services to those who need it most.

HONORING DICK MORRIS 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the career achievements of 
Dick Morris, who is stepping down from the 
Trinity Public Utilities District Board of Direc-
tors after more than four decades of service. 
Mr. Morris was elected to the district board 
on November 3, 1981 when the district was 
first created. He has repeatedly served as 
president, vice president, and clerk of the 
board that he helped form. Over those years, 
Mr. Morris helped bring improvements in elec-
tricity reliability and cost savings for Trinity 
County customers, who enjoy low-cost power 
through the federal Trinity River Division of the 
Central Valley hydropower project. 
Throughout his time on the district board, 
Mr. Morris advocated for annual payments of 
$800,000 to the district, additional regional in-
frastructure, and federal legislation vital to the 
economic health of Trinity County. He sup-
ported the passage of my Trinity County Land 
Exchange Act of 2013 which acquired land for 
the district for economic development. Mr. 
Morris was also key to saving Trinity County’s 
only hospital, vital to the health and well-being 
of the community. 
Madam Speaker, Dick Morris’ long service 
on the Trinity Public Utilities District Board of 
Directors is an exemplary illustration of com-
mitment to improving the life of Trinity Coun-
ty’s rural community through good govern-
ance. Please join me in honoring Dick Morris 
on the occasion of his retirement from the 
board, and in wishing him good luck in his fu-
ture endeavors. 
HONORING PAUL NEUMEIER FOR 
HIS CAREER AND SERVICE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my 
honor to recognize Paul Neumeier for his ca-
reer and service to his community. Through a 
lifetime of work for his family and the public 
good, Michael has become an indispensable 
part of the Upper Peninsula. 
Paul was born in Racine, Wisconsin, on 
June 4, 1947, and later moved to the City of 
Escanaba where he was raised. In 1965, he 
graduated from Escanaba High and was a star 
player on their successful football team. He 
then attended Michigan State University and 
graduated as a double major in Political 
Science and History in 1969. Following his 
education, he began working at his family 
business, Independent Roofing & Siding Co. 
Working for the company for over a decade, 
Paul was inspired to carry on the family busi-
ness. He purchased his uncle’s part of the 
company in 1972 to become partners with his 
father. Paul later became President in 1982, 
ensuring lasting success for the 105-year-old 
company. Under Paul’s direction, Independent 
Roofing 
continued 
their 
accomplishments 
through the years, with the company recently 
receiving a national award from Firestone as 
being in the top 1 percent in the United 
States. Paul is also heavily involved in local 
politics and has served as the Delta County 
Republican Party Chairman for 22 years. 
Today, he continues to remain a strong advo-
cate for his community. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
Paul Neumeier for his career and service to 
his community. Michiganders can take great 
pride in knowing the First District is home to 
such a selfless citizen. On behalf of my con-
stituents, I wish him all the best in his future 
endeavors.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 11, 2022 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise to

and a colleague, Norm Mineta. 
Secretary Mineta was an American patriot 
who served his country with distinction in the 
military, in Congress, and as a cabinet sec-
retary in two administrations. He was a trail-

first Asian-American mayor of a major city, 
San Jose, California; the first Japanese Amer-
ican from the contiguous 48 states to serve in 
Congress; and the first Asian-American cabi-
net secretary. 
When I entered Congress in 1993, I was 
fortunate to serve with and learn from Norm 
Mineta. With our Congressional Districts bor-
dering each other, we worked shoulder to 
shoulder on behalf of our constituents. Our 
staffs worked closely together as well, and our 
offices had a friendly baseball competition in 
which Team Eshoo faced off against Team Mi-
neta. 
Secretary Mineta held a great love of his 
country, and despite being interned during 
World War II, he was not consumed by bitter-
ness. Among his many contributions to our na-
tion was the key role he played in enacting the 
Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provided rep-
arations and an official apology to Japanese 
Americans who were interned during World 
War II. 
While serving as Secretary of Transpor-
tation, he was highly regarded for his steady 
leadership after our country was attacked on 
September 11, 2001, when he grounded all air 
traffic in the U.S. in little more than two hours. 
He is also remembered for his work to estab-
lish the Transportation Security Administration, 
the TSA, and for his insistence, informed by 
his personal experience having been interned, 
that the agency never engage in racial 
profiling. 
It is fitting that he was recognized during his 
life by having the San Jose International Air-
port named in his honor, and being awarded 
the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom 
by President George W. Bush. 
Through his lifetime of service, Norm Mineta 
made our country better and stronger. He was 
a hero in Silicon Valley and beyond, and I’m 
proud to have worked with him and proud to 
have been his friend and colleague. I shall 
miss him greatly and hope that my prayers are 
a source of comfort to his beloved wife Deni, 
his sons David and Stuart, his stepsons Rob-
ert and Mark, and his many grandchildren.

IN HONOR OF STATE 
REPRESENTATIVE CALVIN SMYRE 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and commend a distin-
guished public servant, principled business 
leader, trailblazer, and friend of longstanding, 
State Representative Calvin Smyre of Colum-
bus, Georgia. 
Representative Smyre is completing a long 
and stellar career, spanning 48 years as a 
member of the Georgia State House of Rep-
resentatives, where he is the longest serving 
member in the Georgia legislature. His leader-
ship and political savvy have contributed to a 
great legacy of service to his community, the 
State of Georgia, and our nation, and tonight, 
he will be honored by the Greater Columbus, 
Georgia Chamber of Commerce in recognition 
of his tremendous career in public service. 
Calvin Smyre was born in Columbus, Geor-
gia on May 17, 1947, to Chief Warrant Officer 
Ill Carter Smyre, Jr. and the late Mildred Bass 
Smyre. He earned a Bachelor of Science de-
gree from Fort Valley State University in Busi-
ness Administration with a minor in Account-
ing. 
His career path has taken him from being a 
community organizer in the ‘‘War on Poverty’’ 
to corporate executive for a Fortune 500 com-
pany and a trailblazing national political lead-
er. 
Starting in 1976, as a management trainee 
at the Columbus Bank and Trust Company, 
the Columbus-based division of Synovus Fi-
nancial Corporation, he rose through the ranks 
to become Vice President of Corporate and 
External Affairs, President of the Synovus 
Foundation, and ultimately Senior Vice Presi-
dent and Assistant to the Chairman for Com-
munity Affairs. 
In 1974, at the age of 26, Calvin Smyre was 
elected to the Georgia State House of Rep-
resentatives as its youngest member. In 1984, 
he was the first African American from Geor-
gia elected to the Democratic National Com-
mittee. 
In 1979, he was elected Chairman of the 
Georgia Legislative Black Caucus. In 1982, he 
was elected President of the Georgia Associa-
tion of Black Elected Officials. In 1983, he was 
appointed by Georgia Governor Joe Frank 
Harris as Assistant Floor Leader, and in 1985, 
as the first African American Floor Leader. He 
has served as President of the National Black 
Caucus of State Legislators, Chairman of the 
Georgia House Minority Caucus, and Chair-
man of the Democratic Party of Georgia— 
these last two being firsts for an African Amer-
ican. 
He 
has 
received 
numerous 
legislative 
awards and his legislative record includes au-
thoring the bill making Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr.’s birthday a state holiday; creating the his-
toric Georgia Dome, home of the Atlanta Fal-
cons; and construction of the $62 million Co-
lumbus River Center. 
He has served on numerous boards, includ-
ing the Board of Trustees of the Morehouse 
School of Medicine; the Medical College of 
Georgia Foundation; the Columbus Museum; 
and as Chair of the Fort Valley State Univer-
sity Foundation. He was the catalyst for the 
annual Fountain City Classic football weekend, 
which brings 20,000 fans to Columbus, Geor-
gia contributing millions of dollars to the local 
economy. 
Representative Smyre is a man of faith and 
continues to be a lifelong member of the Ward 
Chapel AME Church in Columbus, Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, last Fall, as Representa-
tive Smyre neared the end of his long and dis-
tinguished legislative and corporate careers, 
we were all delighted, when President Joseph 
Biden announced his intent to name Rep-
resentative Smyre to the United States Diplo-
matic Corps as Ambassador from the United 
States to one of the Caribbean islands, pend-
ing full Senate Confirmation. 
Longfellow wrote: ‘‘The heights by great 
men reached and kept were not attained by 
sudden flight, but they, while their companions 
slept, were toiling upward in the night.’’ Rep-
resentative Smyre has achieved great heights 
and through his service has done so much for 
so many for so long. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues in the House of Representatives to 
join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 
Greater Columbus, Georgia Chamber of Com-
merce, the more than 730,000 people of the 
Second Congressional District, his friends, 
family, and admirers across the country in 
congratulating, honoring, and commending 
The Honorable Calvin Smyre for his many 
years of public service. Moreover, we wish 
him the best for an imminent and successful 
Senate Confirmation as he moves into the 
next chapter of his life.

SKIN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, as May is 
Skin Cancer Awareness Month, I rise today to 
draw my colleagues’ attention to the impor-
tance of knowing the risks for common skin 
cancers and treatment options. 
I am a skin cancer survivor, thanks to reg-
ular screenings and early detection. My father 
was not so lucky and passed away from un-
treated skin cancer. 
Our skin is our largest organ, protecting us 
from temperature extremes, injury, and infec-
tion. When our skin is exposed to the sun for 
an excessive amount of time, particularly our 
face, neck, arms, and hands, DNA damage 
can occur, resulting in non-melanoma skin 
cancer. 
It is estimated that 1 in 5 Americans will de-
velop skin cancer by the age of 70, making 
this the most common type of cancer amongst 
Americans. On average, 3.4 million new cases 
of skin cancer are diagnosed every year, with 
thousands of those cases resulting in death. 
With early detection, the 5-year survival rate 
for melanoma is 99 percent. Today, treatment 
options include both surgery and non-surgical 
radiotherapy. 
Everyone should take steps to avoid skin 
cancer. Do self-exams. See your primary care 
doctor or dermatologist annually and tell them 
about your risk factors, including sun expo-
sure, use of indoor tanning devices, age, prior 
skin cancer or family history, and other health 
conditions. Use broad-spectrum sunscreen 
that filters both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultra-
violet B (UVB) rays and offers a sun protection 
factor (SPF) of 30 or higher every day. Limit 
your exposure during peak sun hours (10 am 
to 4 pm), and wear sunglasses with 100 per-
cent UV protection and a wide-brimmed hat.

HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I wish to recognize the Federation of In-
dian Associations (FIA) as it commemorates 
India’s 75 years of independence as well as 
Asian Heritage Month. Since FIA’s establish-
ment in 1970, its mission has been to serve 
the Indian-American community, promote In-
dian cultural heritage, and advance bilateral 
ties between the United States and India. 
Over the course of five decades, FIA has 
organized numerous outreach events to pro-
vide community support and to celebrate In-
dian culture and heritage. FIA’s efforts have 
included consular document service assist-
ance for over 11,000 community members, 
cultural dance competitions that have engaged 
over 19,000 children in celebration of their 
heritage, and an annual Diwali Soup Kitchen 
which has successfully distributed thousands 
of meals throughout the Northeastern United 
States. Furthermore, FIA helped to distribute 
personal protective equipment and hot meals 
to first responders and community members 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I honor the dedicated work 
of FIA to serve and uplift the Indian-American 
community, sustain the legacy of Indian herit-
age across generations, and foster cross-cul-
tural cooperation and understanding. FIA’s ac-
tivities benefit all the communities in which its 
members reside, and for that, we are all grate-
ful.

FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS 
FAIRNESS ACT OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 11, 2022 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the Rule and my colleague’s legis-
lation, the Federal Firefighter Fairness Act. 
As wildfires grow larger and last longer, fed-
eral firefighters answer the call of duty, leaving 
behind their lives and families for months at a 
time. Our firefighters are routinely exposed to 
occupational hazards ranging from carbon 
monoxide to cancer-causing chemicals re-
leased during fires. 
I wholeheartedly support this legislation and 
efforts to establish a science-based list of dis-
eases for which an automatic presumption of 
work-related illness would apply. This is a 
commonsense policy that ensures our fire-
fighters get the care they deserve. 
I am thankful that House Leadership 
brought this legislation to a vote ahead of this 
year’s wildfire season. Our communities are 
depending on federal fire crews to keep us 
safe and reduce the threat of wildfire—federal 
firefighters should be able to rely on the fed-
eral government for livable wages and healthy 
work conditions in return. 
That’s why I introduced the Tim’s Act, bipar-
tisan legislation to overhaul federal firefighter 
pay, benefits and classification. I urge Con-
gress to pass Tim’s Act and recognize the 
needs of our brave wildland firefighters who 
risk their lives to keep our lands and our fami-
lies safe. 
I encourage a yes vote and thank my col-
league, Rep. CARBAJAL, for bringing this legis-
lation.

RECOGNIZING 
MICHAEL 
RALPH 
THIBAULT FOR BEING INDUCTED 
INTO 
THE 
UPPER 
PENINSULA 
LABOR HALL OF FAME 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my 
honor to recognize Michael Ralph Thibault for 
his induction into the Upper Peninsula Labor 
Hall of Fame. Through a lifetime of service 
and devotion to the public good, Michael has 
become an indispensable part of the Upper 
Peninsula and the state of Michigan. 
The U.P. Labor Hall of Fame was estab-
lished in 1993 to recognize unionists who 
have made an outstanding contribution to the 
cause of worker dignity and workplace fair-
ness. With a lifetime of service to his commu-
nity and state, Michael is very deserving of 
this honor. 
Michael was born in Escanaba, Michigan, 
on November 12, 1949, and was raised in the 
Village of Garden. He spent many summers 
working for local farmers and loggers until he 
graduated from Garden High School in 1967. 
In the spring of 1968, he traveled to Detroit 
with a Garden Peninsula ironworker to find 
work, eventually becoming a permit ironworker 
for a construction site. 
In 1969, Michael decided to return to the 
U.P. and was accepted for an apprenticeship 
with International Association of Iron Workers 
Local 783. Over the next two decades, he 
served as an on-site steward representing 
Local 783 and Local 8 while working on many 
industrial projects. During that time, he joined 
the Joint Apprenticeship Committee for Local 
783 and eventually the Executive Board as a 
Recording Secretary. Michael went on to 
serve in several other supporting roles, includ-
ing as an Ironworker Business Representative, 
a delegate to the Marquette County Labor 
Council, and the founding president of the 
Upper Peninsula Regional Labor Federation. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
Michael Ralph Thibault for his induction into 
the Upper Peninsula Labor Hall of Fame. This 
great honor reflects a lifetime of service to-
wards the rights and wellbeing of fellow work-
ers. Michiganders can take great pride in 
knowing the First District is home to such a 
dedicated leader. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish him all the best in his future en-
deavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE ANNUAL 
GALA OF THE 92ND STREET Y, 
NEW YORK 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the 
92nd Street Y, New York (92NY) on the occa-
sion of its annual gala, entitled ‘‘A Love Letter 
to New York.’’ For nearly 150 years, 92NY has 
promoted learning and culture while providing 
a broad range of services and opportunities to 
the New York City community and beyond. 
Founded in 1974 by a group of German 
Jewish professionals, 92NY has stood as a 
tremendous cultural institution in Manhattan’s 
Upper East Side. As part of the Young Men’s 
and Young Women’s Hebrew Association, 
92NY is testament to the contributions of the 
Jewish community to our city and nation. 
Since its founding, 92NY has expanded be-
yond New York’s borders and has patrons in 
all 50 states and 200 countries around the 
world. 
92NY is committed to enriching the lives of 
its patrons with world-class programming and 
embraces people of all backgrounds and per-
suasions. 92NY serves the Upper East Side 
as a community center, while simultaneously 
acting as a massive learning institution for a 
broader community. 92NY offers programs 
under five main tenants: Arts, Community, 
Jewish Life, Children & Family, and Innovation 
& Social Impact. 
92NY displayed its dedication to its patrons 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. Electing to 
stay open, 92NY was faced with the task of 
adjusting its programming while continuing to 
serve its community. 92NY decided to em-
brace new digital technologies and moved its 
programming online, enabling it to reach a 
wider audience. Over the course of two years, 
92NY created 5,000 original programs and at-
tracted six million views, not only across 
America but from a larger international com-
munity. 
As a result, 92NY has become a global in-
stitution. In order to successfully meet the

needs of its new patrons, 92NY created 
Roundtable, a new online learning platform. 
Roundtable offers high-level courses in the 
Arts, Food, History, Literature, Current Events, 
Economy and Politics taught by world-re-
nowned educators. 92NY hopes this new pro-
gram will create access for their international 
audience and help to form partnerships with 
other major cultural institutions worldwide. 
Formerly referred to colloquially as 92Y, 
92NY has made the decision to change its 
name in order to reintroduce themselves to its 
new global audience while cementing its 
unique relationship with New York City. 92NY 
endeavors to be ‘‘Where New York Meets The 
World.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in celebrating 92NY’s annual gala, 
which marks the beginning of a new global era 
for this incredible institution. For nearly 150 
years, 92NY has made a significant contribu-
tion to New York City’s cultural landscape. I 
wish them the very best of luck in continuing 
to add to the City’s vibrancy and diversity, 
while working to expand their programming to 
audiences across the Country and around the 
World.

HONORING HANDS OF PEACE 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Hands of Peace on the occasion 
of their 20th Anniversary. Headquartered in 
my Congressional District in Glenview, Illinois, 
Hands of Peace empowers American, Israeli 
and Palestinian youth to become agents of 
change. 
Hands of Peace’s flagship Summer Program 
brings American, Israeli, and Palestinian youth 
together in Chicago and San Diego for a 
three-week dialogue-based experience where 
they explore peaceful solutions to foster equal-
ity, freedom and justice. 
Founded in 2002, Hands of Peace is cele-
brating 20 years of impact with more than 700 
alumni creating positive peace around the 
world. Through the hosting of Middle Eastern 
participants in American homes, Hands of 
Peace has built international ties between 
Israeli and Palestinian families, and families 
here in my district. 
Through dialogue, education and action, 
teens learn to listen deeply, share powerful 
stories and work together to improve their 
communities. Hands of Peace also partners 
with local community organizations to educate 
people about the power of dialogue to break 
down stereotypes, encourage civil discourse, 
and shape an understanding of our common 
humanity. 
Hands of Peace continues to work with 
youth leaders to develop their skills and net-
works so they can build positive peace in their 
communities as they grow into adulthood. 
Congratulations to Hands of Peace for em-
powering youth as agents of change and 
building youth leaders. 
ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY OF AMER-
ICA GENOCIDE COMMEMORATION 
EVENT 
HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD remarks I gave before 
the Armenian National Committee of America 
and the Armenian Assembly of America. 
It’s an honor to speak with you today. I’m 
JOSH GOTTHEIMER, representing New Jersey’s 
Fifth Congressional District, and I’m also 
the Co-Chair of the bipartisan Problem Solv-
ers Caucus. Throughout my time in Con-
gress, I’ve always been proud to fight for our 
great Armenian American community in 
North Jersey—one of the largest in the coun-
try. 
Tonight, I want to thank my friends with 
the Armenian National Committee of Amer-
ica and the Armenian Assembly of America, 
and also acknowledge any clergy and faith 
leaders joining us. 
We are gathered here today to remember 
April 24th, 1915: the painful day when hun-
dreds of Armenian intellectuals were round-
ed up and ultimately murdered at the begin-
ning of the Armenian Genocide. May their 
memory be a blessing to us all. 
By coming together to commemorate this 
atrocity, we not only mourn the lives lost, 
but we continue to rededicate ourselves to 
recognizing and speaking out against geno-
cide around the globe and ensuring that we 
stand united in condemning hatred and vio-
lence. 
I believe that it is our duty to speak out 
honestly about historical facts and recognize 
the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians, as 
well 
as 
Greeks, 
Assyrians, 
Chaldeans, 
Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other 
Christians by the Ottoman Empire. 
As the husband of someone who lost entire 
parts of her family during the Nazis’ attempt 
to exterminate European Jewry, the need to 
recognize genocide is a deeply personal one. 
I know that it is never the wrong time to 
bear witness and tell the truth, and that the 
United States should never be complicit in 
denying genocide. 
For too long, this genocide has been de-
nied, and the victims and their families de-
nied full justice. 
In October 2019—nearly three years ago— 
thanks to the tireless efforts of activists and 
community leaders like all of you, as was 
said, we were able to achieve the historic 
passage in Congress of H. Res. 296—a resolu-
tion I was proud to cosponsor and vote for— 
affirming the United States’ recognition of 
the Armenian genocide. 
I was also proud to work with my col-
leagues in the bipartisan Congressional Ar-
menian Caucus to write to President Biden 
urging him to recognize the Armenian Geno-
cide. 
And last year, as was talked about, for the 
first time, the sitting President of the 
United States formally declared the truth. 
As we continue to see a rise in acts of hate 
and targeted violence against ethnic and re-
ligious minorities around the world, it is 
vital that we not conceal or be bystanders to 
evil. 
By recognizing the Armenian Genocide, we 
pay tribute to the perseverance of the sur-
vivors and the dedication and contributions 
of the Armenian Americans who do so much 
to strengthen our communities and our na-
tion. 
I will continue to stand strong with our 
ally Armenia, in the face of threats and con-
tinued attacks from its neighbors, as we un-
fortunately have continued to see, even just 
in the last couple months. That includes con-
tinuing our call for the release of Armenian 
prisoners of war detained by Azerbaijan, as 
well as continued support for critical human-
itarian assistance to Artsakh. 
Know that you have an ally in Congress, 
and that my door is always open to you. 
Today, we solemnly commemorate the 
genocide committed against the Armenian 
people. It is only by raising our voices to ac-
knowledge and remember these horrific 
crimes against humanity, that we can look 
clearly into the future committed to pursue 
justice and eradicate hate. 
Thank you, and God bless America.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise in 
celebration of the completed expansion project 
at Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Medical 
Center. 
For nearly 115 years, Memorial Hermann 
Health System has been the premier health 
care provider in the Greater Houston region 
with 17 hospitals in the area. Located in Hous-
ton, the Memorial Hermann Texas Medical 
Center is one of the nation’s busiest Level I 
trauma centers and serves as the primary 
teaching 
hospital 
for 
McGovern 
Medical 
School at UTHealth. 
The Memorial Hermann Health System is 
famed for its cutting-edge advances in medical 
science and technology. As a nationally ac-
claimed Accountable Care Organization, it pro-
vides exceptional care in cardiology, neuro-
science, orthopedics, women’s health, general 
surgery, and organ transplantation. The Me-
morial Hermann Life Flight air ambulance 
service was the first of its kind in Texas, the 
second accredited air ambulance service in 
the nation, and is the busiest air ambulance 
system in the country. 
In my district, Memorial Hermann The 
Woodlands Medical Center has been a valued 
partner for many years, caring for the commu-
nity and engaging in numerous community 
events and activities, 
Continuing with the system’s tradition of ex-
cellence, Memorial Hermann The Woodlands 
Medical Center houses the Canopy Cancer 
Survivorship Center. A first-of-its-kind facility, 
the Canopy Center offers an array of pro-
grams and services designed to address the 
emotional, physical, and social needs of those 
impacted by cancer. 
In November 2019, the Memorial Hermann 
Health System announced an expansion of its 
hospital in The Woodlands to meet the needs 
of patients and their families in the growing 
Montgomery County community. The new 
South Tower will provide 8 stories of patient 
care and house areas in which patients, their 
families and guests can learn, connect, and 
relax. The new addition will bring expanded 
patient and operating rooms to the campus 
and feature new interventional laboratories to 
allow Memorial Hermann to better serve the 
needs of our growing community. 
I am honored to join the countless friends 
and supporters of the Memorial Hermann

Michael Kova´ts de Fabricy was a Hungarian 
nobleman and accomplished officer in the 
Prussian Calvary. He was a retired Hussar 
major in the Austro-Hungarian army. Upon 
learning of the American Revolution, he wrote 
on January 17, 1777, to American Ambas-
sador to France, Benjamin Franklin, to volun-
teer his services and pledged himself ‘‘faithful 
unto death.’’ 
Kova´ts was appointed colonel commandant 
of Pulaski’s Legion in the Continental Army in 
1778. He recruited, trained, and led what be-
came the first U.S. Calvary unit. He was the 
highest-ranking Hungarian military officer in 
the American Revolutionary War. Kova´ts was 
killed on May 11, 1779, while leading an as-
sault on British troops in Charleston, South 
Carolina. He remained true to his word and 
was loyal and faithful to American freedom to 
his death. 
The Dedication Ceremony was appropriately 
at The Old Exchange Building coordinated by 
Director Tony Youmans. In the American Rev-
olution British tea was seized and stored at 
the Exchange Building basement then sold to 
finance the Revolution and not thrown into the 
harbor. The Color Guard of the venerated 
Washington Light Infantry was provided by 
Major General Henry Siegling, Commander, 
and Colonel Myron C. Herrington, Historian 
and Secretary. The Washington Light Infantry 
is a military and social organization founded in 
1807 as one of the oldest in America. 
The Dedication and Unveiling was con-
ducted by National Society Daughters of 
American 
Revolution 
President 
General 
Denise Doring VanBuren. 
It was extraordinary Deputy Chief of Mission 
of the Embassy of Hungary, Magor Ernyei de-
livered remarks at the event and highlighting 
that there is a statue of Michael Kova´ts in 
Washington outside the Embassy of Hungary. 
Clearly there is great affection in South Caro-
lina for the people of Hungary. We will always 
cherish the courage of Hungarians to oppose 
the Soviet Tank Invasion of 1956 just as we 
support the people of Ukraine to oppose the 
Putin Tank Invasion of 2022. 
Program participants in the service and as-
sisted in this event from the National Society 
of the Daughters of the American Revolution: 
Bonnibel Moffat, South Carolina State Regent; 
Nancy 
Herritage, 
State 
Historian; 
Laura 
Kessler, Historian General; Pamela Bork,

General; Janet Whittington, Curator General;

RECOGNIZING MRS. CAROL 
TAYLOR 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mrs. Carol Taylor for her 
fifty-year career as a teacher and congratulate 
her on her retirement. 
Mrs. Taylor began teaching in Orange 
County in 1965. After five years in Southern 
California, she moved to the Central Valley, 
beginning as a teacher at Terra Bella Elemen-
tary School. After a brief stint in Montana, Mrs. 
Taylor returned to Terra Bella in 1987 where 
she has been teaching ever since. 
Over the course of her career, Mrs. Taylor 
has taught thousands of children, ranging from 
pre-school to 4th grade. Through her dedica-
tion to her students, she was able to provide 
the educational foundation necessary for these 
children to succeed in both school and in life. 
Many of her former students have gone on to 
be successful members our Central Valley 
community, with some even becoming teach-
ers themselves. 
Mrs. Taylor plans to spend her well-earned 
retirement traveling the country, visiting friends 
and family, and spending time with her grand-
children. On behalf of everyone in California’s 
21st congressional district, I would like to 
thank her for fifty years of service to our com-
munity and wish her a long and happy retire-
ment. 
I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing the career of Mrs. Carol Taylor, a fixture 
in our community and an inspiration to us all.

IN RECOGNITION OF DETECTIVE 
CHRIS VAUGHN 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the exemplary work of De-
tective Chris Vaughn as she retires from a life 
of public service. She served the communities 
of Plano, Texas and The Colony, Texas as a 
dispatcher and police officer for over 25 years. 
Detective 
Chris 
Vaughn 
grew 
up 
in 
Loveland, Colorado where she graduated from 
high school in 1983. She moved to Plano, 
Texas in 1991 and worked various jobs before 
being hired in 1994 by the City of Plano as a 
PD/FD/EMD Dispatcher. In 1995, Detective 
Vaughn was hired by the Plano Police Depart-
ment. She attended the North Central Texas 
Council of Governments Regional Police 
Academy and was elected by her class to 
serve as the Secretary/Treasurer. 
In May 1997, Detective Vaughn was hired 
by The Colony Police Department where she 
served as a patrol officer for several years. 
She was selected to be the Drug Abuse Re-
sistance Education (D.A.R.E.) Instructor and 
worked with students in The Colony. During 
her time in patrol, Detective Vaughn earned 
her Intermediate Peace Officer, Advanced 
Peace Officer, and Master Peace Officer Cer-
tifications. She was a Field Training Officer, 
lntoxilyzer Operator, and a Sexual Assault 
Family Violence Investigator Course (SAFVIC) 
certified family violence investigator. 
In June 2013, Detective Vaughn was se-
lected to make a lateral move into the Criminal 
Investigation Division. She solved two missing 
juvenile cold cases early in her tenure as a 
detective. Since then, she has successfully in-
vestigated many major cases where her work 
directly resulted in suspects receiving prison 
sentences ranging from 25 to 70 years. Off- 
duty, she has volunteered on multiple events 
at the Children’s Advocacy Center. Through-
out her life, she has been passionate about 
photography and has recently started a pho-
tography business. 
In total, Detective Vaughn has faithfully 
served and protected North Texas citizenry 
and businesses for more than two and a half 
decades. She has selflessly put others’ safety 
above her own, and I am deeply grateful for 
her exemplary service to our community and 
state. I wish Detective Vaughn the best in her 
retirement.

HONORING SGT. NICK TULLIER 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
our hearts are heavy. Nearly six years ago, 
there was an attack on our community. 
The attack was designed to be divisive—to 
rip our community apart. It did not work. Evil 
was overcome by the goodness—the Godli-
ness—in our community, our state and the na-
tion. Evil did not take hold. 
Rather, we came together to support the six 
peacekeepers shot in the line of duty after an-
swering the call. 
The reports on Deputy Nick Tullier were not 
good. We heard over and over again from the 
doctors and nurses, that he wouldn’t make it 
another hour, another day, another week—that 
he couldn’t make it. None of them knew Nick. 
He had more work to do, or as the men and 
women in blue refer to it, it was not yet the 
‘‘end of watch’’ for Nick. 
At Tiger Stadium the other night, Garth 
Brooks put it another way: Nick ‘‘had more 
dance to share.’’ God had more work for Nick 
to do here on earth. 
Against all odds, Nick fought like hell for 
2,119 days. He was absolutely immersed in 
the love of his family, old friends, new friends 
and complete strangers. Blue and black brace-
lets labeled ‘‘Pray for Nick’’ or ‘‘Nick Tullier 
Strong’’ popped up all over. Even President 
Trump signed onto to ‘‘Team Nick.’’ 
God has now summoned Deputy Tullier 
among the peacekeepers that have finished 
their last call. He’s on a different patrol with 
Corp. Montrell Jackson, BRPD, Officer Mat-
thew Gerald, and Deputy Brad Garafola, 
EBRSO. 
Mary and James’ constant presence and 
endurance demonstrated the boundless and 
unending love of a mother and father. Nick 
knows he was loved and countless parents in 
our community and around the world are in-
spired by their overflowing love and support of 
their son. 
Trenton and Gage’s father’s two decades 
wearing the badge made our community safer. 
He certainly did not do it for the money. Our 
community benefited from his sacrifice. Nick’s 
life embodies a servant’s heart. They should 
be inspired by the life he lived as a peace-
keeper. 
Jamie and Shannon’s brother was a ma-
chine. His physical workouts and fitness were 
impressive. I can only guess that he must 
have beat the heck out of them growing up. I 
hope they cherish those memories of the time 
growing up with their brother and don’t make 
him come back and knock them in line again. 
Seriously, they are charged with ensuring 
Nick’s passing does not create a void on 
earth. 
I hope that all of Nick’s family, friends and 
supporters know that his legacy will be felt be-
yond his time among us. On July 17, 2016 
and the weeks following, we did not allow evil 
to take hold. Rather than giving in, we came 
together and rose up. We united against evil 
and came together for what was good and 
what was right. Much of that coming together 
has died down or subsided for us. 
For the past six years, Nick’s fight never 
died. Every day, with the support of his family, 
he continued. He persevered. 
Just because Nick returned to the Father, 
just because it is the end of watch for Nick 
Tullier—the fight is not over. 
Nick taught us that we can overcome all 
odds. Nick made clear that miracles are pos-
sible. Just as we united against the forces of 
evil six years ago, we can continue to be in-
spired by Nick’s enormous heart. We can be 
inspired by his parent’s incredible dedication. 
Let us honor Nick by continuing to work to-
gether against the evil that is trying to take 
hold, trying to get traction in our community. 
Let’s rise up and support our peacekeepers, 
back the blue—and, Sheriff Gautreaux, the 
green too. We are better than this. 
Garth Brooks went on to sing that, ‘‘I could 
have missed the pain, but I’da had to miss the 
dance.’’ As tough as today is, anyone that 
came into to contact with Nick would agree 
that the dance was worth it. 
Louisiana and America would be less safe 
without our men and women in blue. 
We will remain Nick Tullier Strong. God 
bless.

IN RECOGNITION OF ROY E. 
BREWER 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. Roy E. Brewer for his thirty- 
six years of dedication to the Sacramento Met-
ropolitan 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce 
(Metro 
Chamber) and his contributions to the Greater 
Sacramento area. As the Metro Chamber 
celebrates fifty years of their Capitol-to-Capitol 
(Cap-to-Cap) program, I ask all my colleagues 
to stand with me to honor Mr. Brewer. 
Mr. Brewer is a founding partner of Brewer 
Lofgren LLP Attorneys at Law. He received his 
Juris Doctor at the University of the Pacific, 
McGeorge School of Law in 1982; spending 
his early college years at the University of 
Florida where he earned both a Master of Arts 
and Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. Mr. 
Brewer applied his education as a land use at-
torney in the Sacramento area. Mr. Brewer is 
a trusted advocate at the local, state and fed-
eral levels on many public policy issues. 
Mr. Brewer, the current Board Chair of 
KVIE-PBS for Northern California, has spent 
many decades in community engagement. He 
is a Senior Fellow of the American Leadership 
Forum, Mountain Valley Chapter, and was the 
Board Chair in 2010 through 2011. He has 
also been the Chair of the Capital Campaign 
for the Los Rios Community College District, 
the Chair of Leadership Sacramento, the 
President of the American River Natural His-
tory Association, and the President of the 
Northern California Rugby Football Union. 
In 1990, Mr. Brewer served as President of 
the Sacramento Metro Chamber, lending his 
dedication and expertise to the organization. 
His leadership within the Metro Chamber has 
brought businesses together and has furthered 
economic prosperity throughout the Sac-
ramento region. In 1991, he was honored as 
the Metro Chamber’s Sacramentan of the 
Year, a much-deserved recognition. Today, he 
continues his commitment and enthusiasm 
through the annual Cap-to-Cap event in 
Washington, D.C. This event would not be 
what it is without his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, as Members of the Sac-
ramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce 
celebrate Mr. Brewer, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing his legacy of service to 
the Sacramento region.

HONORING DR. ERIC 
WITHERSPOON 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Dr. Eric Witherspoon, who is re-
tiring after 16 years of extraordinary leadership 
as Superintendent of Evanston Township High 
School (ETHS) District 202. 
Dr. Witherspoon has been superintendent of 
ETHS District 202 since July 2006. Previously 
he served as Superintendent in Des Moines, 
Iowa; Indianapolis, Indiana and Hobart, Indi-
ana. He began his career as a high-school 
English teacher and director of the high school 
gifted education program at Crown Point High 
School in Indiana. 
At ETHS, Dr. Witherspoon focused on eq-
uity and having high expectations for all stu-
dents. He enabled students to have opportuni-
ties to take more honors and advanced-place-
ment classes during their four years of high 
school. Dr. Witherspoon also focused on the 
importance of reading as a pathway to edu-
cation by bolstering student resources. 
Dr. Witherspoon implemented a comprehen-
sive system of academic and social/emotional 
supports to help students to succeed in 
school. And he has renewed the focus on pro-
fessional development for staff. He also cre-
ated programs and partnerships with North-
western University and Oakton Community 
College and expanded career and technical 
education opportunities for ETHS students. 
ETHS launched a long-term strategic initia-
tive to upgrade the entire campus under Dr. 
Witherspoon’s 
leadership. 
Many 
of 
the 
school’s athletic facilities have been en-
hanced, and facility upgrades include the plan-
etarium, Geometry in Construction house- 
building site, science labs, a research and the-
ory center, auto technology, advanced manu-
facturing, Project Lead the Way Engineering, 
and the culinary, ceramics and pottery pro-
grams. 
Under Dr. Witherspoon’s leadership, aca-
demic achievement and the graduation rate at 
ETHS have increased. ACT results reached 
the highest in the history of ETHS for nine 
consecutive years, and ETHS is now recog-
nized by U.S. News and World Reports as 
well as the Washington Post as ranking in the 
top 2–3 percent of all high schools in the na-
tion. Dr. Witherspoon also helped to build the 
ETHS Educational Foundation, an organiza-
tion focused on raising funds to further en-
hance ETHS for all students, teachers and 
staff.

RECOGNIZING 
KATHLEEN 
ANN 
CARLSON FOR BEING INDUCTED 
INTO 
THE 
UPPER 
PENINSULA 
LABOR HALL OF FAME 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 12, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my 
honor to recognize Kathleen Ann Carlson for 
her induction into the Upper Peninsula Labor 
Hall of Fame. Through a lifetime of service 
and devotion to the public good, Kathleen has 
become an indispensable part of the Upper 
Peninsula and the state of Michigan. 
The U.P. Labor Hall of Fame was estab-
lished in 1993 to recognize unionists who 
have made outstanding contributions to the 
cause of worker dignity and workplace fair-
ness. With a lifetime of service to her commu-
nity in healthcare and local labor groups, Kath-
leen is very deserving of this honor. 
Kathleen was born in Iron River, Michigan, 
on September 19, 1960, and was the young-
est of four children. After starting a family, she 
returned to work in 1985 and was hired by the 
Marquette County Health Department in the 
Accounting Department of Administrative Serv-
ices. Her experience there inspired her to join 
her American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local as a 
steward, then Treasurer, and eventually the 
first female President. 
During her involvement with AFSCME, Kath-
leen successfully advocated for and helped 
give a voice to workers across the Upper Pe-
ninsula. Over the years, she went on to serve 
in multiple positions in different local union or-
ganizations such as U.P. Labor Management 
Council delegate, AFSCME Staff Representa-
tive, a transition team member for the Mar-
quette County Labor Council, and many more. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
Kathleen Ann Carlson for her induction into 
the Upper Peninsula Labor Hall of Fame. This 
great honor reflects a lifetime of service to-
wards the rights and well-being of fellow work-
ers. Michiganders can take great pride in 
knowing the First District is home to such a 
dedicated leader. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish her all the best in her future en-
deavors.
