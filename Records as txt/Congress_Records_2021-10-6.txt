CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6926 
October 6, 2021 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object. One hundred years 
ago, not many people could have imag-
ined, certainly not predicted within a 
degree of accuracy, the kinds of tech-
nological advances that we have seen 
over the last century that have allowed 
us all to have lights in our own homes; 
to have televisions, cell phones, all 
manner of conveniences; and that these 
things would be widely available to 
rich and poor alike, urban and rural 
alike. 
These are conveniences that are now 
so common that they are easy to take 
for granted. But they don’t come about 
automatically. They didn’t just hap-
pen. They have been brought to us as a 
result of labor and innovation and dedi-
cation of individuals who took chances 
and created something new. 
Today, I stand opposed to the nomi-
nation of Shalanda Baker because she 
openly opposes the economic system 
that has brought so much fortune to 
our country. Regarding capitalism, free 
markets, Ms. Baker stated the fol-
lowing: 
As we move into this new future, we must 
also remember that a just transformation of 
our energy system requires a careful interro-
gation of the racist, capitalist politics that 
currently drive it. We must expose, and then 
eradicate, these underpinnings. 
Ms. Baker, in addition to having 
made statements like that one, advo-
cates for a cap-and-floor model for 
electric utility pricing, one in which 
high-income individuals would pay a 
minimum—not a maximum, but a min-
imum of 6 percent of their entire 
household income on electricity; and 
then other households who are less 
wealthy—the least wealthy would pay 
no more than 3 or 4 percent of house-
hold income. 
Look, I, too, want to make sure that 
our poorest citizens and our poorest 
communities have access to resources 
and are able to be lifted out of poverty, 
but placing obstacles in the way of 
competitive markets and denigrating 
the very concept of the competitive 
markets that have made electricity 
and so many other developments so 
available to so many people, rich and 
poor alike, would I fear; would I firmly 
believe; would I, am certain, end up 
preventing technological advances that 
benefit everyone in our society. 
For these reasons, I oppose Ms. 
Baker’s nomination, and I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The objection is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate being recognized, and I am grate-
ful that this conversation is being held 
between myself and the Senator from 
Utah, who is one of the more principled 
friends I have made in the U.S. Senate. 
He has been a friend and a colleague, 
and we have worked and partnered on 
numerous things together. He is some-
one that, even though I think I am an 
inch or two taller than him, I look up 
to, in all sincerity. 
I worry about our Nation right now, 
that we are taking statements that 
people have made and whipping around 
them a lot of presumptions. There is a 
difference between saying I am against 
capitalism and I am against racist, 
capitalistic policies. That is a big dif-
ference. 
We are a nation that exploded forth 
to be the dominating economy on the 
planet through the capitalist system. 
But the capitalist system was not fair 
and equal all the time. In fact, it did 
not reflect what Adam Smith himself, 
in his essay on moral sentiments, 
talked about. 
Capitalism is an ideal that the best 
way to distribute goods and oppor-
tunity is through this idea of a free 
market, where everyone has access. 
Clearly, that has not been the case in 
this Nation when African Americans 
were originally, in a capitalist system, 
slaves. Even after the period of our 
greatest national sin, Blacks were still 
held out of equal opportunity to be 
competitive. 
If you look at, perhaps, some of the 
greatest ideas of capitalism—this idea 
of working the land with your sweat 
and labor to produce products to sell 
into the market—well, look at some-
thing like the Homestead Act, where in 
many ways that land belonged to Na-
tive Americans who did not have that 
same 
free 
and 
equal 
opportunity. 
Think about the Homestead Act and 
how waves of incredible, hard-working 
European immigrants got that land, 
but Blacks were excluded. 
No one in this body would deny that 
that is patently racist. 
And this continues. In a lot of our 
biggest businesses, up until the sixties 
and seventies, women weren’t allowed 
equal opportunity. That is a capitalist, 
sexist system that denied equal oppor-
tunity. 
We know this from African Ameri-
cans. I know this from my own family 
story about my father, here in this 
area, coming after college and being 
the first Black person hired by a small 
tech company the President may have 
heard of called IBM—the first Black 
salesman in the entire Virginia area, as 
walls were broken. 
My father told me the story of why 
he left the company that he was work-
ing with. Because one of his managers 
said: You should get out of here be-
cause no nigger is ever going to be al-
lowed to be a manager at this com-
pany. 
That is racism. 
So here is a nominee who—in the 
context literally that my colleague 
read, racist, capitalist policies—no one 
can deny that these policies existed in 
our country and that the free-market 
system hasn’t been free. 
People on both sides of the aisle, I 
have heard, speaking to the corporate 
concentration that is going on, the mo-
nopolistic practices we are seeing ev-
erywhere from the pharmaceutical in-
dustry to pharmacies, from farms to 
tech, that is working against the free- 
market, capitalist ideas of great phi-
losophers, like Adam Smith. So to ob-
ject to someone for that reason, to me, 
is patently unfair. 
And my colleague also objected be-
cause of a policy. He described one pol-
icy. Well, Shalanda Baker is not going 
to be in a position where she is making 
policy. She is going to be charged with 
ensuring that there is equal access and 
opportunity in a wide range of the De-
partment of Energy’s programs, oppor-
tunities, and resources; that we are a 
more inclusive and more equitable Na-
tion. That is her charge. 
And this work is vital because near-
ly, in America, one in three households 
are energy insecure, meaning that they 
have difficulty paying their energy 
bills; and research has, unfortunately, 
shown that low-income households, dis-
proportionately 
Black 
and 
Brown 
households, are more likely to be en-
ergy insecure. 
I love this Nation more than any 
other country on the planet Earth. Yet 
we still have injustices that show that 
African Americans are disproportion-
ately subject to inequalities. 
The crazy thing about this is a spir-
itual law that Martin Luther King em-
bodied so well. He said: 
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice 
everywhere. 
It is a truth. 
In America, poverty is not just a 
problem of the poor; it costs this coun-
try more than a trillion dollars every 
year. So dealing with the fact that 
Blacks 
are 
disproportionately 
poor 
brings resources to us all. Every dollar 
raising one child above a poverty level 
returns $8 to our economy. So address-
ing inequality, addressing disparities, 
helps everyone. 
Energy justice isn’t something we 
talk nearly enough about, and that is 
why Ms. Baker’s role is so important. 
So I am disappointed today. 
I voted against a lot of Trump nomi-
nees, but I voted for a lot whom I dis-
agreed with on policy. There is an ur-
gency right now on this issue in Amer-
ica. There is an urgency right now to 
be a more just and inclusive society. 
There is an urgency right now to cre-
ate deeper community in this country 
and to ensure that everyone has the 
fruits of liberty and opportunity. It is 
what we swear an oath to. It is what 
Ms. Baker’s job is all about—making 
real the words of our united pledge 
that we will be a nation with liberty 
and justice for all. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized.

for Democratic government to raise

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6927 
October 6, 2021 
21⁄2
months’ notice to use the fast- 
track, party-line reconciliation proc-
ess, which they have already used hap-
pily this year and already intend to use 
once again. But the Democrats who run 
Washington have done nothing. They 
have squandered week after week after 
week. The Senate has been voting on 
midlevel nominations. And 21⁄2 months 
later, our colleagues complain that 
time is running out to do their job. 
They are frantically asking our side for 
shortcuts. 
Now, in the past 2 days, I have had 
the surreal experience of watching both 
the President of the United States and 
the Senate majority leader be asked 
about the future of the U.S. economy. 
Their 
respective 
responses 
were 
‘‘That’s up to MITCH MCCONNELL’’ or 
‘‘Ask MITCH MCCONNELL.’’ Well, what 
about the third Democratic leader, the 
Speaker of the House? Well, she has 
headed to Europe—headed off to Eu-
rope. I can only presume she hopes the 
full faith and credit of the United 
States will get sorted out without her. 
That is the level of leadership and ac-
countability the country is getting 
from the Washington Democrats who 
run the country. These are the leader-
ship skills of people who spent 21⁄2 
months doing nothing and then com-
plain they are short on time. That is 
the attitude that has gotten Democrats 
a self-created inflation crisis, border 
crisis, Afghanistan crisis, and free-fall-
ing favorability with the American 
people. 
Now, it is not clear whether the 
Democratic leaders have wasted 21⁄2 
months because they simply cannot 
govern or whether they are inten-
tionally playing Russian roulette with 
the economy to try to bully—bully— 
their own Members into going back on 
their word and wrecking the Senate. 
Either way, it is exactly the kind of 
recklessness 
that 
has 
this 
unified 
Democratic government’s public ap-
proval in total free fall—free fall. 
Even now, while the Democratic 
leader complains that he is short on 
time, he continues to waste time with 
partisan stunts that are dead on ar-
rival. He has scheduled yet another 
vote this afternoon which he knows 
will fail. The majority has known for 3 
months that show votes like this would 
go nowhere. 
This year, Democrats requested and 
won new powers—new powers—to re-
peatedly reuse the reconciliation proc-
ess. In the past few days, Democrats in 
both the House and Senate have pub-
licly admitted their party could han-
dle—could handle—the debt limit that 
way. Our colleagues have plenty of 
time to get it done before the earliest 
projected deadline. There would be po-
tential for time agreements to wrap it 
up well before any danger. But the 
Democratic leaders haven’t wanted so-
lutions; they have wanted to turn their 
failure into everybody else’s crisis. 
Playing risky games with our econ-
omy; using manufactured drama to 
bully their own Members; indulging 
petty politics instead of governing— 
their entire failed approach to gov-
erning in a nutshell, on full display for 
the country to see. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, now on a related mat-
ter, President Biden makes two claims 
about the reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree the Democrats are writing behind 
closed doors. Listen to this: He is say-
ing it costs zero dollars—zero dollars— 
but he needs massive tax hikes to pay 
for it. Talk about magical Washington 
math. If they embark on a Washington 
spending binge, as long as they send 
the bill to the American people and not 
themselves, they consider the whole 
thing free of charge—free of charge. 
Of course Democrats’ plans wouldn’t 
pay for themselves. That is why their 
reckless spending spree needs to come 
paired with a historic redistribution of 
wealth from the American people over 
to the Federal Government. With tril-
lions of dollars in new spending comes 
the largest peacetime tax hike on 
record. 
Democrats’ 
reckless 
taxing-and- 
spending spree isn’t even fully devel-
oped, and it already contains more 
than 40 different tax increases that 
would hurt families and help China. 
Some of the tax hikes take aim at 
workers and families directly. Others 
target small businesses, passthroughs, 
and family farms with extra burdens. 
Still others would make it harder to 
invest, create, and sustain jobs here in 
America instead of overseas. 
Ivy 
League 
economists 
say 
the 
Democrats’ tax hikes would increase 
the incentive for American companies 
to move investments and profits over-
seas. Under Democrats’ proposed ex-
pansion of the global minimum tax, 
more than a dozen of our most devel-
oped peers would have tax structures 
more favorable to U.S. companies than 
our own. If President Biden got his way 
on corporate taxes, even China would 
become more hospitable to job creators 
by comparison. 
So let me say that again: Democrats 
are planning to send America’s top tax 
rate for job creators higher—higher— 
than communist China’s. 
Needless to say, the biggest losers 
when Democrats make it harder to do 
business in America are, of course, 
American workers. Based on data from 
the Joint Committee on Taxation, two- 
thirds of the burden of the corporate 
tax hike Democrats are trying to ram 
through would end up falling on lower 
and middle-income Americans; 98.4 per-
cent of it would hit Americans with in-
comes under $500,000. It turns out that 
President Biden’s promise that taxes 
wouldn’t go up for the vast majority of 
American families wasn’t worth all 
that much. 
Not only are their taxes set to go up, 
so is the budget of the IRS. Democrats 
want to spend $80 billion so the Federal 
tax authorities can expand their reach 
into financial habits of average Ameri-
cans, snooping on transactions as small 
as $600. They want to finance their 
spending spree by effectively treating 
every ordinary American as if they 
were under IRS audit—every ordinary 
American as if they were under IRS 
audit. 
I must have forgotten when the 
President campaigned on giving every-
body their own audit. I don’t remember 
him saying that last year. It isn’t ordi-
nary middle-class Americans who need 
a careful audit; it is the Democrats’ 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree, 
with these historic tax hikes that 
would hurt families and help China. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF ELIZABETH MERRILL BROWN 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I come to 
the floor to call for the confirmation of 
a highly qualified nominee to the De-
partment of Education. 
Over the past year and a half, we all 
know that this pandemic has made life 
harder for so many Americans but es-
pecially students across the country, 
disrupting their classrooms and their 
learning, 
challenging 
their 
mental 
health, and deepening inequities. 
And while we have made significant 
progress, our work to get everyone 
through this pandemic is far from over, 
to say nothing of the challenges in our 
education system that predate the pan-
demic. For example, rooting out sys-
temic racism at every level, ensuring 
students have safe modern schools and 
infrastructure, addressing the student 
debt crisis and high cost of higher edu-
cation, and ending the epidemic of 
campus sexual violence, just to name a 
few. 
In light of all of these challenges, we 
need a fully staffed education depart-
ment to help see our schools through 
this pandemic and to help us build 
back stronger and fairer, which is why 
I have come to the floor today to call 
for the Senate to confirm Lisa Brown, 
the nominee to be general counsel for 
the Department of Education. 
I won’t recite her significant experi-
ence, but suffice it to say she has great 
public service credentials in the execu-
tive branch of our government over 
many years. Lisa Brown proved herself 
well—I should say, proved herself well 
prepared for the work ahead when we 
had our Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee hearing with her 
and she was passed out of the com-
mittee on a bipartisan voice vote. I will 
say that again—a bipartisan voice 
vote. 
She is a highly qualified nominee and 
should not be a controversial one. Stu-
dents, parents, and educators deserve 
to have her confirmed so she can get to 
work for our communities. I urge all 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
her.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6928 
October 6, 2021 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, at this 
time, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the following nomi-
nations en bloc: Calendar No. 188, 255, 
and 256; that the Senate vote on the 
nominations en bloc without inter-
vening action or debate; that the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate; that any 
statements related to the nominations 
be printed in the RECORD and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the nominations of 
Gwen Graham, of Florida, to be Assist-
ant Secretary for Legislation and Con-
gressional Affairs, Department of Edu-
cation; Roberto Josue Rodriguez, of the 
District of Columbia, to be Assistant 
Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, 
and Policy Development, Department 
of Education; and Elizabeth Merrill 
Brown, of Maryland, to be General 
Counsel, Department of Education? 
The nominations were confirmed en 
bloc. 
Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on Sep-
tember 25, President Biden tweeted: 
My Build Back Better Agenda costs zero 
dollars. 
That is right. According to the Presi-
dent, a series of new, permanent enti-
tlements and a massive expansion of 
government, the biggest expansion of 
government, at least, since the New 
Deal, is going to cost zero dollars—that 
from the President of the United 
States. 
And the President has now been dou-
bling down on that claim. On Monday, 
he once again tweeted: 
The fact of the matter is my Build Back 
Better agenda costs zero dollars. 
Well, no, Mr. President, the fact of 
the matter is your Build Back Better 
agenda costs $3.5 trillion, at least. That 
is the minimum number. The Com-
mittee for Responsible Federal Budget, 
where the President’s Treasury Sec-
retary served on the board before join-
ing the administration, estimates the 
cost at $5 trillion or more. 
Leaving that aside, even if the Presi-
dent has been merely trying to claim 
that his plan is fully paid for by tax 
hikes and other measures, to say that 
it would cost zero dollars is beyond ri-
diculous. 
I mean, think about it. Let’s say 
your college education was completely 
paid for by your parents. Did it then 
cost zero dollars? Of course not. It 
costs a lot of money—money that your 
parents likely were able to pay only be-
cause of a lot of hard work and sac-
rifices. 
What if you saved up for a couple of 
years for your dream vacation, and 
now you have all the money that you 
need, down to the cost of your Ubers 
and your hotel breakfasts, does that 
mean that your vacation is going to 
cost zero dollars? Of course, it doesn’t. 
The same thing applies when it 
comes to the Democrats’ legislation. 
Even if Democrats add all the money 
they need to pay for every dollar of 
their 
massive 
spending 
spree, 
the 
pricetag still wouldn’t be zero dollars. I 
mean, it just absolutely doesn’t pass 
the sanity test for Americans. 
The pricetag for this proposal is, at 
least minimum, $3.5 trillion and likely 
much, much more. Presumably, what 
the President has been referring to 
when he makes the absurd claim that 
his spending bill will cost zero dollars 
is his assertion the bill won’t add to 
the debt. 
The problem is that isn’t true either. 
Because the pay-fors in the Democrats’ 
bill won’t actually pay for the bill in 
its entirety. The tax hikes in the 
Democrats’ legislation will actually 
only pay for about two-thirds of the 
bill’s ostensible $3.5 trillion pricetag. 
The other revenue-raising compo-
nents in the bill won’t make up the dif-
ference. What are those other revenue- 
raising components? Well, a substan-
tial part is increased IRS enforcement. 
Democrats claim they can get $700 bil-
lion in more revenue by closing the tax 
gap, the difference between taxes owed 
and taxes paid. 
There is no question that individuals 
shouldn’t get away with cheating on 
their taxes. And there are, undoubt-
edly, reasonable measures we can take 
to strengthen enforcement and narrow 
the 
gap. 
Unfortunately, 
Democrats 
haven’t proposed any reasonable meas-
ures. 
Instead, the Democrats are proposing 
to, A, double the size of the IRS and, B, 
have the IRS snoop on Americans’ 
bank accounts. That is right. Demo-
crats want to double the size of the IRS 
and force banks, credit unions, and 
other financial institutions to provide 
details of individuals’ spending to the 
Federal Government. Under the admin-
istration’s proposal, once your with-
drawals or deposits for the year exceed 
a certain amount—and that amount, by 
the way, if the President has his way, 
is $600—your bank or credit union 
would be forced to report the details of 
your 
activity 
to 
the 
Federal 
Government. 
So the Federal Government could end 
up with a record of every time you eat 
dinner out or pay your rent or buy a 
new jacket or a toaster oven. The inva-
sion of privacy being talked about here 
is absolutely staggering. 
We already have a mechanism in 
place to allow the IRS to view large 
transactions that might indicate po-
tential criminal activity. We do not 
need the Federal Government moni-
toring every purchase that law-abiding 
Americans make from the App Store or 
how many times Americans buy a cup 
of coffee, not to mention the incredible 
demands this reporting requirement 
would place on community banks and 
credit unions. Banks and credit unions 
around the country are worried about 
how they would manage to comply 
with the bill’s reporting requirements. 
Let’s not forget that the Agency that 
would be receiving all of this informa-
tion has a reputation for mishandling 
private data. In fact, the IRS was sub-
ject to a massive leak, or hack, of pri-
vate 
taxpayer 
information 
mere 
months ago—information that some-
how ended up in the hands of advocates 
at ProPublica—and neither Treasury 
nor the IRS has provided meaningful 
followup about that data breach, much 
less any accountability. Giving an al-
ready troubled Agency access to reams 
of additional private taxpayer informa-
tion is a very bad idea. 
Even if we granted that this massive 
invasion of privacy were worth it, the 
truth is that all of this additional en-
forcement still wouldn’t provide the 
money that Democrats are claiming it 
would provide. Democrats claim that 
they can get $700 billion from the bill’s 
increased tax enforcement measures. 
The reality is more likely to be about 
$200 billion lower, according to an anal-
ysis from the Wharton School of busi-
ness. So Democrats would be doubling 
the size of an Agency with clear man-
agement issues and implementing a 
staggering invasion of taxpayer pri-
vacy to pay for a tiny fraction of their 
spending spree. 
As I said, no taxpayer at any income 
level should be able to avoid paying the 
taxes he or she owes. I have actually 
signed on to cosponsor legislation that 
would look at responsible ways to 
strengthen IRS enforcement efforts. 
But Democrats’ proposal to double the 
size of the IRS and track taxpayer 
spending 
should 
never—never—have 
seen the light of day. Even former IRS 
Commissioner 
John 
Koskinen, 
who 
served under Presidents Obama and 
Trump, said he thought that $80 billion 
for the Agency was too much. 
Taken together, the IRS enforcement 
on steroids and Democrats’ massive tax 
hikes will still not be enough to pay for 
their multitrillion-dollar legislation, 
partly because the tax hikes may not 
bring in as much as the Democrats 
claim but also because Democrats have 
used a lot of budget gimmickry to dis-
guise the true costs of their bill. 
The standard method for analyzing 
the cost of a bill is a 10-year—10-year— 
budget window. So you look at what 
your bill would cost over 10 years, and 
that is how you get the cost of your 
bill. That is normally the way that it 
works around here. 
Well, that is not exactly what the 
Democrats are doing. That child allow-
ance in the Democrats’ bill? Democrats 
have only counted the cost of that al-
lowance through the year 2025. That al-
lows Democrats to claim that the cost 
of that provision is around $500 billion 
instead of the $1.1 trillion the measure 
would actually cost over a decade.

October 6, 2021 
All of those tax hikes are, of course, 
just for covering the costs of the bill 
over a 10-year or shorter window, but 
in reality, the new government benefits 
the Democrats are putting in place are 
not going to expire in 10 years. This 
bill is effectively instituting multiple 
permanent—permanent—entitlement 
programs. The long-term cost of those 
programs is not going to be covered by 
the tax hikes Democrats are currently 
proposing, as massive as those tax 
hikes are. 
I have talked a lot about the dollar 
costs of this bill, which are massive— 
the biggest expanse of government in, 
literally, my generation in history. I 
could spend just as long talking about 
the bill’s other costs, like the fact that 
the bill is likely to cost workers jobs 
and opportunities by increasing the tax 
burden on American businesses and de-
pressing economic growth, or the cost 
to American families, who are going to 
be facing higher energy bills and higher 
prices as a result of this legislation, 
but I am going to stop here for today. 
One thing is for sure: Democrats’ 
massive spending spree is going to cost 
a lot more than zero dollars. And 
American taxpayers? Well, the Amer-
ican taxpayers are going to be paying a 
heavy price for this legislation for a 
very long time to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
agree with what my colleague from 
South Dakota and my neighbor has had 
to say about the issues of the spending 
bill. 
I would also add that people all 
around the country are paying the 
price right now with rising prices. 
They are getting hammered at the gro-
cery store and hammered at the gas 
station, and every month since Joe 
Biden took the oath of office, prices 
have risen faster than wages. People 
are feeling the pain and the bite taken 
out of their wallets. Even without the 
specific raised taxes that the Demo-
crats are proposing, the American peo-
ple have already taken a pay cut. 
I note that the majority leader has 
arrived on the floor, so I am going to 
delay the remainder of my remarks so 
he can continue with his leader time at 
this point. 
I thank the Acting President pro 
tempore. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
thank my friend from Wyoming, and I 
ask unanimous consent that he be able 
to resume as soon as I finish my re-
marks. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, in America, Mr. 
President, we have always kept a basic 
promise: We pay our debts on time 
without exception. It has been a key to 
our economic success and our standing 
in the global markets across the world. 
Today, it is time for us in this Cham-
ber to do our jobs and make sure those 
promises remain unbroken. 
In order to preserve the full faith and 
credit of the United States, the Senate 
must act and, by the end of this week, 
send a bill to President Biden’s desk 
suspending the debt ceiling and allow-
ing our government to keep paying its 
bills and meeting our outstanding obli-
gations. 
Later this afternoon, the Senate will 
vote on cloture on the House-passed 
message that would suspend the debt 
ceiling through December 2022. If clo-
ture is invoked, the Senate will then 
vote to pass this bill on a simple ma-
jority basis. 
Democrats have been clear from the 
start: We are going to do the respon-
sible thing and vote to allow the 
United States to keep paying its bills. 
Every single one of us is going to vote 
for cloture this afternoon. 
For months, Leader MCCONNELL and 
Senate Republicans have insisted they 
want a solution to the debt ceiling but 
only if Democrats do all the work by 
themselves. We have already presented 
Republicans with numerous opportuni-
ties to do what they say they want, in-
cluding offering a simple majority vote 
so Democrats can suspend the debt 
ceiling on our own, as Republicans 
have asked, but each time, Republicans 
have chosen obstruction and have kept 
us, unfortunately, on a path to default. 
Republican obstruction on the debt 
ceiling over the last few weeks has 
been reckless; it has been irresponsible. 
Nonetheless, today, Republicans will 
have an opportunity to get exactly 
what they have kept asking for. The 
first and easiest option is this: Repub-
licans can simply get out of the way, 
and we can agree to skip the filibuster 
vote so we can proceed to final passage 
of this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
complete my remarks and then the 
Senator 
from 
Pennsylvania, 
Mr. 
TOOMEY, be allowed to complete his re-
marks prior to the scheduled rollcall 
vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
what people in Wyoming are seeing 
every day, and that is rising prices 
when they go to the gas station, when 
they go to the grocery store. They are 
paying more and more. 
Every month since Joe Biden took 
the oath of office, prices have been ris-
ing faster than wages. People are feel-
ing the bite in their wallets of these 
higher prices. In effect, people all 
across the country and certainly in my 
home State of Wyoming have suffered 
a paycheck cut because the money just 
doesn’t go as far. President Biden told 
us this wouldn’t happen. He actually 
said inflation was transitory. Well, 
President Biden may still believe that. 
Yet, after 7 months in a row, it doesn’t 
look transitory to most Americans. 
Now, economists have actually re-
vised their expectations of inflation, 
and they have revised them in ways 
that we are going to be paying higher 
prices for longer periods of time. They 
have revised their expectations about 
economic growth as well, and they 
have revised those downward—inflation 
up; economic growth down. 
Well, on Friday, the Commerce De-
partment said one measure of inflation 
has actually hit the highest that it has 
been 
in 
30 
years. 
The 
company 
Salesforce now estimates that costs for 
Christmas shopping will go up by 20 
cents for every dollar you would spend 
on Christmas presents. The store Dol-
lar Tree has announced that it will 
start selling items that cost more than 
a dollar. We have 10 Dollar Tree stores 
in Wyoming. They are a very impor-
tant part of our communities. Many 
people in rural areas rely on dollar 
stores for their everyday needs. In Joe 
Biden’s economy, these people are get-
ting hurt the most. 
So why is it happening? Well, it is be-
cause the money supply hasn’t in-
creased this fast in 75 years. 
Last year, Congress spent trillions of 
dollars to respond to the worst pan-
demic in our Nation’s history—actu-
ally, in a century. With a Republican 
majority in the Senate, we passed five 
relief bills, and they were all done in a 
bipartisan, overwhelmingly majority 
vote. Much of the money still hasn’t 
been spent. 
Then, this January, Democrats took 
over the White House as well as the 
Senate. They got their hands on the 
Nation’s credit card, and they started 
swiping it. 
In March, the President signed a $2 
trillion spending bill that was supposed 
to be about coronavirus. Yet only 9 
percent of the money actually went to 
public health. They cut Republicans 
out of the negotiations completely. So 
much of the new spending went to the 
Democrats’ favorite groups—to labor 
unions, to union bosses, to bankrupted 
blue States. They put the bill for all of 
that spending entirely on the American 
credit card. The Federal Reserve start-
ed printing money, and prices started 
going up. 
Yet Democrats haven’t learned their 
lesson. They want to keep spending. 
Now they want to spend more than 
twice as much money as they just 
spent in March, and they are also ask-
ing for the largest tax increase in 50 
years. Tax increases also raise prices. 
Last week, the White House Press 
Secretary made a statement, and, to 
me, it was one of the most irrational 
statements that some business owners 
have ever heard. She said: It is ‘‘unfair 
and absurd’’ for companies to raise 
prices in response to higher taxes. She

said it is absurd and unfair for compa-
nies to raise prices in response to high-
er taxes. Well, it may be unfair, but it 
certainly is not absurd; it is basic 
arithmetic. 
When 
the 
government 
raises taxes, the cost of doing business 
goes up. Companies either have to cut 
costs or increase their revenue. When 
Democrats raise taxes, it means higher 
prices, fewer jobs, and in many cases, 
both. 
It is why it is alarming that Presi-
dent Biden wants to raise taxes on 
American energy. Energy prices have 
already gone up. Oil, yesterday, was at 
a 7- or an 8-year high. Natural gas 
prices have doubled this year. Demo-
crats are now proposing a new fee on 
natural gas production. According to 
one estimate, the new fee would cost 
our economy $9.1 billion and eliminate 
90,000 good-paying American energy 
jobs. It would also mean higher energy 
prices for people trying to heat their 
homes and cool their homes. Higher en-
ergy prices also mean higher grocery 
prices. They mean higher retail prices. 
It may be unfair, according to the 
White House Press Secretary, but it is 
not absurd because prices are rising for 
a reason. They are rising because 
Democrats spent trillions of dollars 
that we cannot afford. 
Democrats need to learn their lesson 
before it is too late. Stop this rush to 
more taxes and spending and bor-
rowing. Stop cutting into people’s pay-
checks. American families are feeling 
the pain. Stop pouring more fuel on 
this fire of inflation that is raging 
across the country. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
SAULE OMAROVA 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to 
address the recent announcement from 
President Biden that he intends to 
nominate Saule Omarova to be Comp-
troller of the Currency. 
Now, Ms. Omarova, if she were, in 
fact, confirmed to be Comptroller of 
the Currency, she would head up the 
Agency that is responsible for char-
tering and regulating national finan-
cial institutions. So that is to say she 
would be the head of, the primary regu-
lator for, America’s national banks, of 
which there are very many. 
I just want to provide this morning a 
brief introduction, a glimpse, into the 
mindset of this nominee. I will take 
more time on future occasions to delve 
more deeply into some of the things 
that she has advocated for and written 
about and that I find extraordinarily 
disturbing. I think many of my col-
leagues will as well. But let me start 
with just a few observations. 
First, 
there 
is 
little 
doubt 
Ms. 
Omarova has been celebrated on the far 
left for promoting ideas that she her-
self has described as ‘‘radical.’’ That is 
a point we can agree on. These are 
very, very radical ideas. In fact, I don’t 
think I have ever seen a more radical 
choice for any regulatory spot in our 
Federal Government. I know that is a 
very sweeping statement to make. I 
think I can stand by it. 
There is a lot that is extraordinary 
and radical here, but maybe the heart 
of it is Ms. Omarova doesn’t just want 
to tighten regulation of banks. That is 
not what she is advocating for. What 
she wants to do—these are her words— 
‘‘effectively ‘end banking’ as we know 
it.’’ Those are words she wrote just last 
year. This is not ancient history. These 
are the views she has articulated in 
writing within a year. 
She clearly has an aversion to any-
thing like free market capitalism, and 
that is in her writing. In an October 
2020 paper called ‘‘The People’s Ledg-
er,’’ she outlined a plan for ‘‘radically 
reshaping the basic architecture and 
dynamics of modern finance.’’ 
And what this was all about, what 
she was arguing for in this paper from 
just last year, was really promoting 
the nationalization of an entire indus-
try—retail banking; basically bringing 
to an end the ability of banks to com-
pete for customers’ services and in-
stead nationalize that; a clear socialist 
idea that we shouldn’t have a free en-
terprise system competing for people’s 
business but rather have the govern-
ment own it and provide that. 
Specifically, she wants the Federal 
Reserve to allocate credit and capital. 
And as part of this regime, she advo-
cates that the government, acting 
through the Fed, would actually cut off 
credit to those deemed ‘‘socially sub- 
optimal.’’ 
Can you imagine? Is there something 
more chilling than the idea that we 
would abolish retail banking, make it 
the responsibility of the Fed, and then 
actively require that the Fed decides 
who is socially optimal and who is not, 
and then allocate credit accordingly? 
This is unbelievable. 
In a 2012 paper, she suggested a man-
date that financial products could only 
be sold if they are approved in advance 
by the Federal Government. 
There is no freedom to innovate 
there. There is no responding to cus-
tomers’ wants and needs. There is no 
competition 
for 
providing—none 
of 
that. The government will decide what 
can and cannot be offered. 
Even she admitted that this is ‘‘pa-
ternalistic and has command-and-con-
trol elements.’’ At least she acknowl-
edges that is what this is. 
But 
it 
doesn’t 
end 
there. 
Ms. 
Omarova doesn’t just want to nation-
alize banking. She wants to do that, 
but that is not all. She also wants the 
banking regulators to run the whole 
economy. 
Under her plan, which she, again, laid 
this out in writing in—this is in a 2016 
paper, the Federal Reserve would set 
prices in large sectors of the U.S. econ-
omy, those that she deems to be ‘‘sys-
temically 
important 
prices,’’ 
that 
would include—she helpfully tells us 
what would be considered systemically 
important prices—‘‘ . . . widely used 
fuels, foodstuffs, and some other raw 
materials’’ and ‘‘wages or salary indi-
ces,’’ among others. 
So she is openly advocating that the 
Federal Government sets wages and 
prices throughout the economy. 
Does this sound anything like a free 
enterprise economy? 
It is unbelievable. 
In addition to that, citing a desire to 
‘‘sidestep debilitating political battles 
over the Federal budget’’—now, just 
think about that term. Let’s unpack 
that just a bit. ‘‘Debilitating political 
battles over the Federal budget.’’ That 
sounds to me like Congress arguing 
over spending—arguably, the most fun-
damental responsibility of Congress. 
But in order to sidestep that—that 
fundamentally democratic process that 
follows our Constitution—in a 2020 
white paper, Omarova proposed cre-
ating a National Investment Authority 
to channel both public and private cap-
ital to further policies that would be 
set by an unelected, unaccountable 
board. 
So the American people don’t get to 
decide how their tax dollars get allo-
cated by holding Members of Congress 
accountable through elections. Instead, 
there would be some board that would 
make all these decisions for us. 
And that is not the only unaccount-
able body she has proposed to exert 
control over the private sector. 
In a 2012 paper, Ms. Omarova also 
proposed creating a Public Interest 
Council—a Public Interest Council. 
And their purpose would be to use pres-
sure and propaganda tactics to manipu-
late public opinion against banks and 
regulators, and to ‘‘generate mass po-
litical support for the actions it con-
siders necessary,’’ and ‘‘build its inde-
pendent power base.’’ 
I am almost speechless. It is abso-
lutely—so you could ask yourself: 
Where would a person even come up 
with these ideas? How does it even hap-
pen that it occurs to someone to think 
up these things? 
Well, maybe a contributing factor 
could be if a person grew up in the 
former Soviet Union and went to Mos-
cow State University and attended 
there on a Vladimir Lenin Academic 
Scholarship. 
Now, let me by very, very clear about 
something. There are lots of wonderful 
American citizens who were born and 
raised behind the Iron Curtain—I to-
tally get that—including in the former 
Soviet Union, who have come to this 
country, and they love America as 
much as anyone I have ever met. I 
know some of them personally. So I am 
not suggesting in any way that grow-
ing up behind the Iron Curtain and at-
tending university in Moscow is in any 
way disqualifying. But the attitude a 
person has about the Soviet regime, 
now, that is another matter. 
So in the case of Ms. Omarova, in 
2019, she tweeted: ‘‘Say what you will 
about the old USSR, there was no gen-
der pay gap there. Market doesn’t al-
ways ‘know best.’ ’’ 
Say what you will about the old 
USSR. Really? There is a lot to say. I 
will have a lot to say on another occa-
sion about the old USSR.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6931 
October 6, 2021 
She followed up with a tweet. She de-
cided to clarify that, and here is the 
tweet she issued afterward. She said: ‘‘I 
never claimed women and men were 
treated absolutely equally in every 
facet of Soviet life. But people’s sala-
ries were set (by the state) in a gender- 
blind manner. And all women got very 
generous 
maternity 
benefits. 
Both 
things are still a pipe dream in our so-
ciety!’’ 
Can you imagine? 
Ms. Omarova clearly knows her views 
are far outside of the mainstream. How 
do we know? Well, why else would her 
most recent resume have been scrubbed 
of one particular item that was on her 
resume as recently as 2017? 
And that item is the thesis that she 
wrote when she was a student in Mos-
cow on her Vladimir Lenin personal 
academic scholarship. The title we 
know. The title of the thesis was ‘‘Karl 
Marx’s Economic Analysis and the 
Theory of Revolution in The Capital.’’ 
Unfortunately, that is all I know 
about this thesis. 
Now, this morning, I released a letter 
that I sent to Ms. Omarova requesting 
that she provide a copy of this paper in 
the original Russian to the committee 
in time for us to translate it so that we 
can fully consider her nomination. 
Like most committees, the Banking 
Committee requires nominees provide 
copies of any articles or papers they 
have written, and that is a very impor-
tant tool that we use to evaluate a per-
son’s thoughts and fitness and tem-
perament, and judge and where they 
are coming from. 
I am looking forward to receiving 
that paper from her. 
I will conclude with this: You know, 
in a country as big as ours, where we 
have 330-some million people, I have no 
doubt that there are some individuals 
that we can find here and there who 
would think of the Soviet Union—that 
brutal, oppressive, totalitarian, free-
dom-suppressing, 
soul-sucking, 
mur-
derous regime that was the Soviet 
Union—there must be some people 
somewhere in America who somehow 
would compare it favorably to the 
United States, as shocking as that is. 
What has never occurred to me is 
that a person who thinks that way 
could possibly be considered to an im-
portant, powerful, and prominent posi-
tion in the Federal Government. 
I yield the floor.

INFLATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, from 
gas stations to grocery stores, to util-
ity bills and restaurant checks, the 
American people are being pummeled 
by inflation. The cost of everything is 
going up. 
Last week, the Commerce Depart-
ment reported that a key indicator of 
inflation had reached the highest level 
in three decades—30 years. 
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve 
has said that we are unlikely to turn a 
corner on this until sometime next 
year. How he knows that, I don’t know. 
Previously, he said, well, this inflation 
would be merely transitory, a passing 
thing. But it is beginning to look like 
that is not the case. And, clearly, he is 
mainly guessing. 
With this as a backdrop, our Demo-
cratic colleagues are apparently trying 
to figure out how to inflict even more 
economic pain on the American people. 
They spent months negotiating solely 
among themselves in order to bring 
about a radical transformation in our 
country by spending money on pro-
grams we don’t need or want—things 
like permanent welfare for no work re-
quirements; things like tax increases 
that, contrary to President Biden’s 
promise, will hit Americans earning 
less than $400,000 a year; subsidies for 
millionaires; buying electric vehicles 
that most average wage earners can’t 
afford; taxes that will hurt American 
businesses and help our major nation- 
state competitor, China; as well as pro-
vide a range of so-called free—they like 
that word ‘‘free’’—social safety-net 
programs that really aren’t free at all. 
Now, this isn’t critical funding nec-
essary to lead America out of the pan-
demic like we did last year on a bipar-
tisan basis. This isn’t even designed to 
revive our struggling economy. I would 
argue that it would do just the oppo-
site. It would suppress the recovery 
from the recession that was caused by 
the pandemic. This is merely a reck-
less, partisan spending spree designed 
to grow the size of government’s role in 
our daily lives. 
In recent weeks, I have heard from 
more than 50,000 of my constituents— 
that is a lot—about one absurd exam-
ple of government overreach proposed 
by the administration and which is 
part of the reconciliation bill that is 
now sitting in front of the House of 
Representatives. 
The 
IRS 
already 
knows how much money you make, but 
now the Biden administration wants to 
know how you spend it too. This isn’t 
a safeguard to stop illicit activity like 
money laundering or tax fraud. That 
already exists. Any taxpayer who re-
ceives a transfer of $10,000 or more in a 
single transaction has to report that to 
the IRS. But what our Democratic col-
leagues want to do is to invade the pri-
vacy of everyday Americans who rarely 
make 
five-digit 
transactions. 
So 
tucked in the President’s budget is a 
new IRS reporting requirement with a 
much lower threshold, $600. 
If you use your bank accounts to 
spend or receive more than $600 in a 
year’s time, our Democratic colleagues 
think that should be reported to the 
IRS. So if you are writing a check for 
your mortgage or your rent or maybe 
you are buying a new washer or dryer 
or refrigerator, the IRS wants to know 
that you are spending that money. 
This is an Agency that has already 
been plagued by scandals and has hard-
ly been a responsible steward of per-
sonal financial data. 
Earlier this year, an unknown source 
within the IRS leaked more than 15 
years’ worth of taxpayer information 
to journalists. And we all remember 
the IRS targeting conservative-leaning 
groups during the Obama administra-
tion. But the IRS has given even more

personal financial data, literally con-
ducting surveillance on the American 
people. The trove of information that 
could be abused gets a lot bigger. 
Democrats want to give the IRS 
more manpower to sift through all of 
this by doubling the size of the Agency, 
adding to an army of Internal Revenue 
agents out searching for more revenue 
with which to grow the government. So 
instead of a chicken in every pot, every 
household will get an audit. 
This is, I submit, a fundamental at-
tack on the privacy and financial free-
dom of everyday Americans and puts 
all Americans’ data at risk of being 
hacked or leaked. 
It also places a huge new burden on 
our 
community 
banks 
and 
credit 
unions. Having to organize and trans-
mit all this additional data to the IRS 
in a secure way is no easy task. Does 
the administration plan to help local 
banks, credit unions do this? I doubt it. 
It is just going to add to their overhead 
and to their administrative burdens. 
Our Democratic colleagues also want 
to reinstate the so-called SALT deduc-
tion, which allows wealthy individuals 
in blue States—it is no coincidence—to 
pay less in taxes. According to the lib-
eral Tax Policy Center, 93 percent of 
those making a million dollars or more 
would get a tax break. 
So much for our Democratic col-
leagues’ rhetoric about millionaires 
and billionaires getting a tax break. 
They want to make sure that each one 
of them gets about a $48,000 tax cut 
under their proposal. This isn’t an at-
tempt to support those who are strug-
gling to make ends meet; it is a finan-
cial lifeline for millionaires and bil-
lionaires. 
This type of legislation our col-
leagues are trying to pass includes a 
massive, ill-conceived tax plan; govern-
ment overreach; irresponsible spend-
ing; and radical policies that put un-
necessary burden on beleaguered Amer-
ican workers and families. 
Earlier this year, our Democratic 
friends charged nearly $2 trillion to the 
taxpayer credit card in a party-line 
vote. Unlike the COVID–19 relief bills 
we passed last year virtually unani-
mously, one after the other, when the 
Biden administration came into office, 
the first thing they did was spend $2 
trillion in borrowed money, only 10 
percent 
of 
which 
was 
related 
to 
COVID–19. 
So they did that without any Repub-
lican help. Now they are trying to fig-
ure out how to go on an even bigger 
spending 
blowout—once 
again, 
all 
alone. But they think upping the credit 
limit should be a bipartisan task. Our 
friends across the aisle have talked 
about how, historically, lifting the 
debt ceiling has been a bipartisan en-
deavor, but they failed to mention that 
so has spending. 
There has never been a time in our 
country’s history when one party has 
spent trillions of dollars and aspires to 
spend trillions of dollars more without 
the support of a single person on the 
other side of the aisle. 
Why would Republicans vote to in-
crease the debt limit and sign off on 
this reckless spending? If someone 
stole your credit card and ran up the 
bill, would you up your own credit 
limit so they could continue shopping? 
No way. But that is exactly what 
Democrats are asking Republicans to 
do by upping the debt limit. 
They have the votes. They have a 
process by which they can raise the 
debt limit, and they need to do it be-
fore we risk a default, according to the 
timeline given to us by Secretary 
Yellen. 
So our Democratic colleagues have 
chosen to light taxpayer dollars on 
fire, but we are not going to hand them 
another match. We have been clear on 
that 
point 
since 
at 
least 
July. 
Unsurprisingly, our friends on the 
other side don’t like this plan. They 
see the dangers in continuing to drive 
up the debt without any action to ad-
dress the root causes, and they want to 
have Republicans to share the blame. 
But what needs to happen is some ac-
countability 
because 
accountability 
will bring with it some fiscal responsi-
bility. But as long as our Democratic 
colleagues can continue to spend tril-
lions of dollars in borrowed money on 
their reckless tax-and-spending spree 
and have us join them in raising the 
debt limit, then no one—no voter, no 
taxpayer—can actually know who is to 
blame. 
Well, if Democrats want to spend 
alone, they have to up the debt ceiling 
alone, too, and we know they have the 
tools and the votes to do it. But rather 
than addressing this problem in July or 
August or September, our Democratic 
colleagues have waited until the last 
minute and march us closer and closer 
to a debt crisis. They have had the 
time to up the debt limit on their own, 
and they have had the means to do it. 
So they need to stop playing chicken 
with an economic crisis and do what 
they know needs to be done. 
So far, Democrats have not been held 
back by their razor-thin majority. It 
didn’t stop them from spending $2 tril-
lion in borrowed money at the begin-
ning of this year. It hasn’t slowed their 
plans to try to spend trillions more 
this fall. And now it shouldn’t stop 
them from increasing the debt limit on 
their own so the American people can 
see who is responsible and hold those 
elected officials accountable in the 2022 
election. 
The Democratic majority of the Sen-
ate has embraced a go-it-alone attitude 
on legislating all year, and these are 
just some of the examples of what that 
has produced: tax increases on the mid-
dle class; car subsidies for millionaires; 
taxes that hurt American businesses 
and American jobs but actually help 
China; providing so-called free, tax-
payer-funded social safety net pro-
grams to try to turn the United States 
into a European welfare state; in-
creased IRS surveillance of the every-
day finances of average Americans; and 
I mentioned, finally, tax breaks for 
millionaires and billionaires. 
So now is the time to reap what our 
Democratic colleagues have sown, and 
I hope they will act sooner rather than 
later. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, short-
ly, I will be making a unanimous con-
sent request to confirm the nomination 
of Ms. Karen Hedlund to be a member 
of the Surface Transportation Board. 
Ms. Hedlund served as Deputy Ad-
ministrator of the Federal Railroad 
Administration, and before that, as 
Chief Counsel at the Federal Highway 
Administration. She has spent most of 
her career in the development and fi-
nancing 
of 
infrastructure 
projects 
across the United States, including im-
provements to the national freight rail 
system. 
She is well qualified to be a member 
of the Surface Transportation Board, 
which we know is so critical to the 
movement of freight; and her appoint-
ment comes at a time when there are 
many important issues and decisions 
before the Board. 
Ms. Hedlund was nominated by the 
President in April. She received bipar-
tisan approval in the Commerce Com-
mittee now over 2 months ago, and it is 
time for the full Senate to do the same. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the following nomi-
nation: Calendar No. 315, Karen Jean 
Hedlund, to be a member of the Surface 
Transportation Board for a term expir-
ing December 31, 2025. I further ask 
unanimous consent that the nomina-
tion be confirmed, the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, article II of the 
Constitution gives this body some im-
portant responsibilities, including the 
responsibility to provide advice and 
consent on Officers of the United 
States. We have to confirm people after 
they have been nominated by the 
President. 
As a Member of the Senate, I take 
this responsibility seriously, and I do 
my due diligence once a nominee has 
been submitted by the President and 
consideration by the Senate. I have 
done that here. 
And in the process of that due dili-
gence process with this nominee, I sub-
mitted a number of written questions 
to Ms. Hedlund in order to develop a 
better understanding of how she would 
respond to certain issues that are di-
rectly relevant to the position for 
which she is seeking confirmation from 
the Surface Transportation Board. 
Specifically, I asked her how she 
would approach: 1, cost-benefit anal-
ysis in proposed regulations; 2, the

scope of the SBT’s rulemaking author-
ity; 3, how she would approach consid-
eration of rate regulation, rate caps, or 
price controls; 4, her definition of the 
public interest, which is a key term 
that comes up as used in STB pro-
ceedings; 5, how she would balance Am-
trak access to the freight rail network 
with reliable freight service; and, 6, 
how she would approach the carrying 
out of the NEPA process, including the 
definitions behind the key regulatory 
terms at issue. 
These are all issues that are really 
relevant to the STB, and these are the 
kinds of questions that deal with the 
kinds of things she would do if con-
firmed as a member of the STB. 
Needless to say, I was disappointed 
with my responses. Some of the an-
swers avoided answering my questions; 
some answers appeared to be purposely 
vague; and some refused even directly 
to answer the question. 
So for these reasons, I voted against 
Ms. Hedlund’s nomination before the 
Commerce Committee, and my position 
has not changed since that vote took 
place. I am not comfortable granting 
my consent today, and I will not be, 
until I have the information and more 
thorough, responsive answers to my 
reasonable questions. And so for these 
reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Ms. BALDWIN. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, tomorrow 
marks the 20th anniversary of the 
launch of the U.S. military offensive in 
Afghanistan against the Taliban and 
al-Qaida in response to their ruthless 
attack on America. As a result of our 
Nation’s resolve and the sacrifice and 
service of our brave men and women 
over the past two decades, Osama bin 
Laden is dead, and our homeland has 
been guarded against additional large- 
scale terror attacks. 
Up until President Joe Biden’s sloppy 
and poorly planned exit from Afghani-
stan, al-Qaida and the Taliban were on 
the run, but today, due to the decisions 
of President Biden, the radical extrem-
ists who sponsored Osama bin Laden 
and partnered with al-Qaida, who are 
responsible for the deadliest terror at-
tack in history, are back in power. 
How did we get here? 
It became apparent at last week’s 
Armed Services hearing, after I ques-
tioned our top military leaders, that 
President Biden made a completely un-
conditional withdrawal. The President 
simply looked at the calendar and saw 
what he thought would be an easy po-
litical victory and decided we would be 
out of Afghanistan by the 20th anniver-
sary of 9/11. 
Another fact that became clear after 
the hearing last week is that President 
Biden casually dismissed the sound ad-
vice of his own military leaders. He dis-
counted the tactical and strategic 
value of keeping a small force in place 
to defeat the terrorists. Then, to cover 
for those mistakes, President Biden 
misled the public about the advice that 
he was given and refused to take. 
So let’s be clear about what happened 
as a result of the President’s ignoring 
his own generals’ recommendations. He 
abandoned American citizens behind 
enemy lines, left strong allies and part-
ners to fend for themselves against the 
Taliban, tarnished America’s reputa-
tion, and created the conditions that 
led to the devastating loss of 13 brave 
American servicemembers. He stub-
bornly led our country into the most 
disastrous diplomatic and military de-
bacle in modern history. 
Those now in control of Afghanistan 
are a who’s who of international ter-
rorists. Nearly half of the members of 
the new Afghan Government are on the 
U.N. 
Security 
Council’s 
terrorism 
blacklist—that is the U.N., folks, their 
terrorism blacklist—including the Act-
ing Prime Minister and both of his 
Deputies. At least two principal mem-
bers of the Haqqani network, which is 
a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist or-
ganization, are in the highest positions 
of the Taliban’s new government. The 
Minister of the Interior is on the FBI’s 
‘‘Most Wanted’’ list. His uncle, the 
Minister of Refugees, is designated a 
terrorist by our government. Together, 
the U.S. Government values the reward 
for their arrests at $15 million. 
The Biden doctrine put America’s 
most wanted back in charge of a ter-
rorist training ground and increased 
the risk of attacks against our home-
land. And we didn’t leave the terrorists 
emptyhanded either. In our rush for 
the exits, we left tens of billions of dol-
lars’ worth of military weapons and 
gear behind, which is now in the hands 
of the enemy. We can expect to encoun-
ter this tactical equipment again on 
the battlefield—but our own equipment 
being used against us. Here are just a 
few numbers: 600,000 weapons, 22,000 
humvees, and more than 200 aircraft. 
Folks, we left America’s most wanted 
with America’s best weapons. 
But it is not just weapons and mili-
tary capabilities; President Joe Biden 
left behind our own citizens, stranded 
in a foreign country governed by 
known terrorists. As much as the ad-
ministration wants to act like this is 
all in the past and we have closed the 
book on Afghanistan, it is just not re-
ality. Right now, we have American 
citizens stranded in Afghanistan. Let 
that sink in for just a moment, folks. 
Americans and our Afghan partners, 
who worked with us over the past two 
decades—interpreters and translators— 
are all sitting ducks for the Taliban. 
When we ask for an accurate account-
ing of who and how many are still left, 
the Pentagon points the finger at the 
State Department, which then goes 
radio silent. 
The administration is downplaying 
the evils of the Taliban, and its refusal 
to state hard facts is stunning. 
The chorus of praise from the State 
Department and the White House in 
calling the Taliban ‘‘businesslike’’ and 
‘‘professional’’ would be comical if it 
weren’t so horrifying. If using Kabul’s 
soccer stadiums to publicly execute 
dissidents, overseeing the legal rape of 
young girls through child marriage, 
and settling disputes by chopping off 
hands and feet is how the Taliban does 
business, 
then 
President 
Biden 
is 
right—they are truly pros. 
GEN Mark Milley admitted the exit 
was a ‘‘strategic failure’’ in his testi-
mony last week. Folks, that is an un-
derstatement. President Biden and his 
top foreign policy adviser, Secretary of 
State Antony Blinken, have serially 
failed to own up to this fiasco. Some-
one must take responsibility for this 
colossal failure. 
As we uncovered again last week, 
President Biden’s decisions led us here, 
right back where we began. Both Gen-
eral McKenzie and General Milley tes-
tified last week that ‘‘al-Qaida is still 
at war with us’’ and that within the 
year, they ‘‘could be reconstituted with 
aspirations to attack the U.S.’’ During 
Joe Biden’s campaign, he promised a 
return to normalcy. Little did we know 
that meant a return to vulnerability 
and an America that is less safe from 
terrorists who attacked our homeland 
20 years ago. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, on Au-
gust 16, as everything was collapsing in 
Afghanistan, President Biden said: 
We have developed counterterrorism over- 
the-horizon capability that will allow us to 
keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct 
threats to the United States in the region 
and to act quickly and decisively if needed. 
He was stating that we don’t have to 
have an on-the-ground presence in Af-
ghanistan to keep Americans safe and 
that we can rely instead on over-the- 
horizon strikes, where we use drones 
and other assets to take out terrorists 
from hundreds or even thousands of 
miles away. 
Since then, we have learned that the 
President wasn’t being truthful. 
At the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee’s open hearing on Afghanistan’s 
disaster, CENTCOM Commander Gen-
eral Kenneth McKenzie testified on the 
immense challenges we face in pre-
venting terrorist groups, like al-Qaida 
and ISIS, from using Afghanistan as a 
launching pad to attack us here at 
home.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6934 
October 6, 2021 
What President Biden seems to con-
veniently ignore is that a successful 
over-the-horizon 
counterterrorism 
strategy requires more than just the 
ability to hit targets across long dis-
tances. We also have to be able to iden-
tify targets; we have to be able to lo-
cate targets; and we have to be able to 
reach those targets. 
To do this effectively, we first need a 
U.S. presence in the region or at least 
a reliable on-the-ground partner there. 
Without that, our ability to gather the 
intelligence necessary to pick the right 
targets is severely degraded. 
We saw the tragic consequences of 
acting on incomplete intelligence on 
August 29, when a drone strike mistak-
enly killed 10 innocent Afghans, includ-
ing 7 children and an aid worker with 
ties to the United States. 
Second, we need a reliable way to ac-
tually get to the target. 
President Biden likes comparing Af-
ghanistan to countries like Yemen and 
Syria, but there is a huge difference be-
tween these countries. Afghanistan is 
landlocked, and our drones can’t just 
fly over the ocean to get there, like 
they can to Syria and to Yemen. 
When it comes to Afghanistan, our 
drones have to cross over other coun-
tries on the way, and those countries 
are not obligated to allow us to use 
their airspace. 
General McKenzie confirmed to me 
during our hearing that, because we 
have withdrawn from Afghanistan, we 
need to rely on Pakistan’s airspace if 
we want to reach targets like ISIS-K or 
al-Qaida, and that should concern 
every American. 
Pakistan, 
historically, 
is 
the 
Taliban’s fiercest international sup-
porter, and they could revoke our ac-
cess at any point. And if they do, we 
would need to ask China, Iran, or Cen-
tral Asian nations with close ties to 
Russia for permission to use their air-
space or even their bases in order to 
conduct counterterrorism operations. 
When I asked about this during the 
SASC hearing, Secretary Austin con-
firmed recent reports that the U.S. 
military—the finest fighting force in 
the world—has had conversations with 
Russia about using their bases in Cen-
tral Asian nations on Afghanistan’s 
northern border. 
Secretary Austin insisted that we 
haven’t asked for Russia’s permission 
to use these bases; we are simply con-
sidering an offer that they made. But if 
we have to consider an offer from the 
Kremlin just to keep al-Qaida from 
surging back in Afghanistan, President 
Biden hasn’t put America on a very 
strong footing. 
The bottom line is that our chaotic 
exit from Afghanistan has made it 
much harder for the U.S. military to 
keep the American people safe from 
terrorists. 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General 
Milley said during last week’s hearing 
that Presidents are elected to make 
strategic decisions. He also told us that 
the Afghanistan withdrawal was a stra-
tegic failure. 
And he was right. The way things 
stand today, we are at risk of recre-
ating the same conditions that existed 
before 9/11. The Taliban is running 
things in Kabul, and given their long-
standing partnership with al-Qaida, it 
is naive to expect that they would pre-
vent these terrorists from operating 
freely. 
Anyone who says that we are safer 
today than we were 20 years ago is get-
ting ahead of themselves, and that goes 
for President Biden too. He needs to be 
more honest about what his decision to 
leave Afghanistan, no matter the cost, 
means for our Nation’s security. 
Real leaders take responsibility for 
their mistakes; they do not make ex-
cuses for them. And, unfortunately, 
that is all we have heard from the 
President so far. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, over the 
past—first of all, let me just agree with 
the Senator from Nebraska. She is ex-
actly on target here. This is a problem 
that we are in a—I have said several 
times, I cannot remember a time that 
we have not been—that we have been in 
a greater threat than we are today. 
Over the past 2 weeks, just to kind of 
let you know where we are now, the 
Armed Services Committee held two 
classified sessions and two open hear-
ings on Afghanistan. That is the com-
mittee that actually had these in their 
schedule. These are really eye-openers, 
and I think we have a lot of time to un-
cover what happened and where we go 
from here. 
First, we heard from General Milley, 
the commander on the ground in Af-
ghanistan through July. He went up to 
the July period of time. Then we heard 
from the Pentagon’s top policy official, 
Colin Kahl. In open testimony, we 
heard from Secretary of Defense Aus-
tin, the President’s top military ad-
viser; General Milley; and General 
McKenzie, who is in charge of the com-
batant command that oversees the 
Middle East. We also heard from two 
outside experts with decades of experi-
ence following Afghanistan and the re-
gion. Here is what we learned. Now, I 
am going to list these things. There are 
actually seven things we learned, and 
it is very significant. 
No. 1, we learned that top military 
leaders advised President Biden to 
keep at least 2,500 troops. Now, the 
President came out and said that 
wasn’t true. Yet every military person 
who offered testimony has said, yes, 
that is exactly true. They all rec-
ommended to President Biden to keep 
at least 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. If 
not, then, you know the results that 
are coming from that. You know what 
we are living with today. 
This advice goes counter to what 
President Biden told the American peo-
ple back in August. He said his gen-
erals did not advise him to leave troops 
there. Now we know that is not true, 
and we know that he said that and he 
misled the American people. This is a 
very significant point. 
The second thing: As I said, we 
learned that al-Qaida was never gone 
from Afghanistan. As Biden says, they 
were there all along, and they were a 
big part of the Taliban’s victory. Now 
they are focused on external oper-
ations. Al-Qaida and ISIS could be able 
to strike America’s soil as soon as a 
year from now; that is, striking us on 
our soil here in America. Even worse, 
the withdrawal from Afghanistan was a 
shot of adrenaline in the arm of the 
radical Islamic terrorists everywhere. 
They now have a victory to point to. 
The third thing: We learned that by 
completely withdrawing from Afghani-
stan, we nearly zeroed out our capabili-
ties to strike those same terrorist or-
ganizations. We understand this. Not 
many people would disagree with this. 
General McKenzie said he was not con-
fident that the United States would be 
able to prevent al-Qaida or ISIS from 
using Afghanistan as a launching pad 
for terrorist activity, and here is why— 
and this is important. The administra-
tion isn’t talking about this. Afghani-
stan poses a unique set of challenges. It 
is landlocked. We don’t have any bases 
nearby. This was driven home by our 
Senator—a few minutes ago—from Ne-
braska. Our generals confirmed that it 
is extremely difficult and costly to get 
the intelligence and conduct the types 
of operations the President said he 
would do. This came from all of the 
military leaders. 
Let’s not forget—we still have not 
killed the terrorists directly respon-
sible for the attack that killed 13 U.S. 
servicemembers. Just imagine—they 
are still out there. 
President Biden decided to put the 
Taliban 
in 
charge, 
hoping 
they 
changed. The first thing they did was 
broadcast a video on Afghan national 
TV saying the United States deserved 
the 9/11 attack. It turns out that the 
Taliban is the old Taliban. They 
haven’t really changed a bit. What this 
means is that Afghanistan is now the 
safest place in the world for radical Is-
lamic terrorism. We are at greater 
risk, and we are less safe. 
The fourth thing out of seven: We 
learned—and I quote General McKenzie 
directly—‘‘The war on terror is not 
over, and the war in Afghanistan is not 
over either.’’ But President Biden told 
the American people and told the 
whole world that the war is over. We 
know better than that. Evidently, the 
terrorists didn’t get the memo. As Gen-
eral Milley put it, ‘‘Al-Qaida is still at 
war with us, and never has not been.’’ 
No. 5: We learned without a shadow 
of a doubt that our allies and partners 
and our adversaries, too, are ques-
tioning our credibility and resolve. In 
fact, General Milley said that our 
credibility has been ‘‘damaged.’’ At 
last week’s hearing, our experts con-
firmed that President Biden’s botched 
withdrawal has caused our allies to 
question our ability to stick to our 
strategies and policies.

October 6, 2021 
No. 6: We learned that our military 
leaders 
would 
not 
call 
President 
Biden’s evacuation operation an ‘‘ex-
traordinary success’’ like he did. Gen-
eral Milley called it a ‘‘strategic fail-
ure.’’ 
Now, I want to be clear. This wasn’t 
a failure on the part of our troops. Our 
troops served admirably. They rescued 
120,000 people. They did what they were 
told to do. Their Commander in Chief 
led them astray. 
As Dr. Vali Nasr said just the other 
day—he told our committee last Thurs-
day that the end game in Afghanistan 
was not our ‘‘finest moment.’’ That is 
an understatement, and that is some-
one trying to figure out some way to 
justify what went on. 
The last thing, No. 7: We learned that 
President Biden simply ignored the 
conditions-based approach. 
Now, one thing I will say about the 
previous approach. People are confused 
sometimes about what our previous 
President said. He had a conditions- 
based approach, and the hallmark of it 
or the center of that conditions-based 
approach was that we would leave 
troops there to protect our Americans. 
We don’t even know right now how 
many Americans are there. 
So we learned that President Biden 
simply ignored the conditions-based 
approach. President Biden could have 
easily said: The Taliban has not met 
our conditions. We are going to stay in 
Afghanistan and ensure that no terror-
ists are able to hit us. 
That is what his military advisers 
recommended that he say, and he 
didn’t do that. In fact, President Biden 
ignored the conditions on the ground 
and instead decided to accept a signifi-
cant amount of strategic risk. That 
means the United States is less safe 
today, and our credibility for the fu-
ture is shot through, and that is what 
his decision means. 
We lost credibility because we left 
Americans and our Afghan allies be-
hind. No one will believe what America 
says after this, and I am not sure why 
they should. I can’t think of a time in 
history that this has happened. This is 
simply just something that is brand 
new. 
One thing we didn’t get clear answers 
on despite the repeated bipartisan re-
quests is exactly how many Americans 
and Afghan partners did we leave be-
hind and what is going to happen to 
them. DOD pointed to the State De-
partment and vice versa. That is just 
unacceptable. 
We don’t know how many people we 
left behind. You know, we heard the 
Secretary actually made a statement 
approximating at one time between 3- 
and 4- and 500, and the next approxima-
tion was closer to 10,000. So we don’t 
really know that. It is bad enough that 
we leave them behind, but we don’t 
even know how many people we left. 
This is why I am going to continue 
calling for more hearings until we 
get—we have to get the answers. This 
isn’t going to go away. 
Why does all this matter? America is 
less safe than we were before because of 
President Biden’s decisions. Six years 
ago, former Secretary of Defense Rob-
ert Gates said: 
I think [President Biden] has been wrong 
on . . . every major foreign policy and na-
tional security issue over the past four dec-
ades. 
America is now more vulnerable to 
terrorist attacks. We all understand 
that, and the whole world understands 
that. We have no plan to meet that 
threat. 
We also have to think about what 
this means for our biggest challenge, 
and that is, of course, our challengers 
of China, Russia, North Korea, Iran. 
They are all celebrating now. China is 
engaged in a historic nuclear buildup— 
one that we have never seen anything 
like before. Russia just conducted its 
largest military exercise in four dec-
ades. They are watching this debacle 
and thinking how weak America looks. 
Now, if President Biden can’t get coun-
terterrorism right, how can his admin-
istration put together a strategy to 
confront China and Russia? 
Unfortunately, this strategic failure 
of our Afghanistan exit is encouraging 
our adversaries to test us—the exact 
opposite of deterrence. That is what I 
am worried about now. I am more wor-
ried about it after last week. That is 
why I am going to keep fighting for 
more open hearings so the American 
people and our adversaries and our en-
emies and our friends will understand 
what it is all about. And this will be 
the real America, not what they expe-
rienced recently. 
That is why I continue to push for 
adequate defense funding, to make sure 
that we prioritize nuclear moderniza-
tion, and to pass this year’s NDAA as 
soon as we can get it to the floor. 
By the way, this is the one bill that 
I have every expectation we will get. 
The NDAA, the National Defense Au-
thorization Act, is one that we have 
passed for 61 consecutive years. I have 
every expectation that we will do it 
now. I don’t like the idea that the 
Democrats are putting this off as if 
there is no threat out there. I don’t 
think that is going to happen. 
That is why we have to keep getting 
to the bottom of this. We have taken 
some big hits—big hits—out there, and 
we have got to recover. OK. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from North Da-
kota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
am here today to join my colleagues 
and first associate myself with all of 
the words from the ranking Republican 
from the Armed Services Committee, 
Senator INHOFE. 
Very well said, Senator, and I agree 
wholeheartedly. 
I express my profound disappoint-
ment in President Biden’s handling of 
the botched withdrawal from Afghani-
stan. The American people and cer-
tainly my constituents in North Da-
kota are upset, and they have every 
right to be. 
For weeks, we were inundated with 
horrifying stories of Americans and our 
allies fleeing for their lives, paired 
with the constant stream of disturbing 
images and videos out of Afghanistan 
as it was taken over by the Taliban. 
Yet, 
somehow—somehow—President 
Biden has the audacity to call the 
withdrawal 
an 
‘‘extraordinary 
suc-
cess.’’ Well, President Biden is wrong. 
It was not an extraordinary success. 
The withdrawal was an abject failure, 
and President Biden bears all of the re-
sponsibility for it, and that is to say 
that he is the reason it was an abject 
failure, because our heroes in uniform 
did an incredible job against very dif-
ficult odds and, frankly, with very poor 
leadership coming from the Oval Of-
fice. 
The reality is, the President misled 
the American people to justify his deci-
sions and to downplay his failures. 
Now, terrorists are emboldened, our al-
lies are questioning the resolve of the 
United States, and the United States is 
less safe because of it. 
The reality is, his deceitful rhetoric 
really began several months ago. In 
August, he led us to believe our mili-
tary leaders were united in their sup-
port of his withdrawal plans. Like 
many of my colleagues, I expressed 
concerns at the time when his plans 
were first announced and urged him to 
follow a conditions-based withdrawal. 
He did not. 
To rationalize his choices, he worked 
to convince us that the most senior 
leaders in the Pentagon were standing 
behind him, agreed with him. They 
gave him this advice, he said. As we 
have heard from multiple generals, 
that is simply not true. 
The President also misled us about 
the conditions on the ground in Af-
ghanistan. In an August speech, he said 
the Afghan military force had ‘‘300,000 
strong, incredibly well equipped fight-
ers.’’ The Special Inspector General for 
Afghanistan Reconstruction said in a 
report that is not true. It said that of 
the 300,000 members of the Afghan Na-
tional Defense and Security Forces, 
only 182,000 of them were Afghan Na-
tional Army members and the rest 
were members of the Afghan National 
Police. 
Well, when I discuss the number of 
servicemembers in our Armed Forces, I 
don’t include the number of police offi-
cers or even FBI agents. That would be 
inaccurate at best, and then deceitful 
at worst. Yet, here, the President is 
doing exactly that. 
President Biden used that 300,000 
number to claim the Afghan Govern-
ment could defend itself, and he later 
tried to say no one could predict their 
forces would fall so quickly. 
Was he being dishonest with the 
American people, or was he just not 
being given accurate information by 
his senior leadership about the condi-
tions there? 
Well, neither ignorance nor incom-
petence are a very good answer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6936 
October 6, 2021 
Later in the month, when it became 
clear the withdrawal was going to be a 
failure, President Biden insisted that 
the United States would get all Ameri-
cans who wanted to leave out of Af-
ghanistan. Well, he didn’t. He failed. 
And no one, including him—and least 
of all him—wants to take responsi-
bility. The State Department says, you 
know, talk to the Defense Department. 
The Defense Department says talk to 
the State Department. But no one is 
taking responsibility. 
And I say the buck stops in the Oval 
Office with the President, who let that 
happen and who is letting his team 
dodge taking responsibility, all while 
Americans fear for their lives in a 
country run by terrorists and terrorist 
sympathizers. 
Near the end of August, after 13 brave 
U.S. military members were killed in 
an ISIS-K terrorist attack during the 
botched withdrawal, President Biden 
rushed to release a statement taking 
credit for this retaliatory drone strike. 
He said: ‘‘I said we would go after the 
group responsible for the attack on our 
troops and innocent civilians in Kabul, 
and we have.’’ 
Well, except he hadn’t. It was later 
revealed, as we know, that the strike 
did not take out any ISIS-K leaders. In 
fact, it took out 10 civilians, including 
7 children. But, since then, the Presi-
dent said nothing. He didn’t say any-
thing about this horrifying revelation 
when it was clear that he misled the 
American people in the wake of the 
strike. 
Our military leaders did not agree 
with the withdrawal plans. The Afghan 
Army was not prepared to defend itself. 
We did not get every American out of 
the country, and justice was not deliv-
ered to ISIS-K or its leaders after it 
killed 13 American heroes. 
And what now? What do we have to 
show for it? 
Well, America is less safe than it was 
when President Biden became Presi-
dent. As our top military leaders testi-
fied in yet another contradiction of 
President Biden’s claims, al-Qaida is 
alive in Afghanistan and looks to carry 
out a strike right here on American 
soil. 
How are we supposed to stop it? 
Our military leaders don’t have faith 
in the over-the-horizon strategy that 
President Biden repeatedly touts to 
give us reliable information. 
Who is going to help us? 
Our strongest allies and partners and 
longest 
standing 
friends 
vocally 
distanced themselves from us amid this 
botched withdrawal. 
All of this is what President Biden 
called an extraordinary success. Well, 
it is an extraordinary embarrassment 
is what it is. The American people are 
smart enough to not fall for such an 
obvious attempt to hide the truth from 
them. 
That is why we, on the Armed Serv-
ices Committee, are going to continue 
investigating the withdrawal and hold-
ing the Commander in Chief account-
able for his poor judgment and actions, 
even if he won’t take the responsi-
bility. That is what our constituents 
expect and deserve, and I urge my col-
leagues to join in supporting those ef-
forts. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, tomorrow marks the 20th anni-
versary of Operation Enduring Free-
dom, and the start—the beginning—of 
those combat operations in Afghani-
stan. It is a benchmark that makes 
what has happened on the ground dur-
ing and since our disastrous with-
drawal from Kabul all the more dis-
gusting. 
Over the past 2 months, we have lis-
tened in disbelief as mouthpieces at 
the State Department, the Pentagon, 
and the White House talked about the 
Taliban in the same way they would 
have addressed a legitimate governing 
body. 
Last week, during a hearing before 
the Armed Services Committee, we saw 
our civilian and military leaders evade 
responsibility for the violence, death, 
and chaos that has occurred on their 
watch. But we also listened closely as 
they revealed appalling inconsistencies 
between the spin from the White House 
and the reality of the situation on the 
ground. 
Here is the reality: Afghanistan is 
under the control of terrorists. These 
terrorists have longstanding ties with 
al-Qaida and the Haqqani network, and 
those relationships aren’t going to 
take a back seat now that the Taliban 
is in charge of the entire country. This 
was no ordinary transfer of power. Af-
ghanistan isn’t Germany or France or 
the United States, and we shouldn’t 
pretend that it is, because it is impos-
sible to act as a legitimate government 
when your goal is not to govern but 
your goal is to manipulate through 
acts of terror. 
This is what the Taliban is doing, 
and it is not happening in secret. The 
cameras are rolling. The world is 
watching. Inclusivity clearly isn’t a 
priority, as much as the White House 
would like to make out that it is. The 
Taliban cleared out the women’s affairs 
ministry and replaced it with ‘‘Min-
istry for Preaching and Guidance and 
the Propagation of Virtue and the Pre-
vention of Vice.’’ 
The Taliban’s desire to curry favor 
with China has Uyghurs living in Af-
ghanistan running scared. Afghanistan 
was a haven for these people during the 
Cultural Revolution, and now the fami-
lies of those who fled are afraid that 
the Taliban is going to round them 
up—yes, round up the Uyghur Mus-
lims—and sell them—that is right—sell 
them to the Chinese Communist Party 
in exchange for economic aid. 
Fears 
that 
the 
Taliban 
would 
weaponize access to the internet be-
came reality before the last American 
left the country. They are well on their 
way to creating a tightly controlled 
online cesspool of dangerous anti-West-
ern propaganda. 
Meanwhile, the Afghan economy is in 
the gutter. The Taliban’s military 
campaign shut down basic commerce in 
much of the country, making food 
shortages worse and putting a million 
children—a million children—at risk of 
starvation and death. 
Healthcare 
infrastructure 
is 
col-
lapsing. And now the Afghan people are 
facing the possibility of blackouts be-
cause the Taliban can’t be bothered to 
figure out how they are going to pay 
the electric bill. 
And what intel we do have suggests 
that al-Qaida will use this chaos void 
left by Biden’s disastrous withdrawal 
to rebuild their operations. That is 
right—al-Qaida is present in Afghani-
stan. 
I think it important to understand 
that all of this violence and disorder 
barely scratches the surface of what 
the Taliban is capable of instigating. 
On August 20, President Biden stated 
with absolute certainty: ‘‘I have seen 
no question of our credibility from our 
allies around the world.’’ 
During last week’s hearing, General 
Milley disagreed with that assessment. 
I disagree with that assessment, as do 
many Tennesseeans that I talk with 
when I am home every weekend. They 
understand that Operation Enduring 
Freedom may have come to an end, but 
that the world is still watching to see 
how the United States of America is 
going to respond to one of the most 
anti-equality, anti-peace, and anti- 
freedom organizations on the face of 
the Earth. 
Our actions and our reactions will in-
form those from the rest of the world, 
and it is time for the Biden administra-
tion to recognize that and to act ac-
cordingly. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senator 
ROUNDS and I be allowed to speak for 5 
minutes each before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, it 
gives me no pleasure to stand on the 
Senate floor today and talk about 
President Biden’s ill-advised and cha-
otic withdrawal; to talk about the con-
sequences for the people of Afghani-
stan, who trusted us and who took our 
side for 20 years; and to talk about the 
tremendous harm it has done to Amer-
ica’s reputation. 
The President, I think, believes that 
the cost of this debacle has been only a 
few weeks of bad press. I think he is, 
sadly, wrong. Perhaps the President is 
banking on the American people for-
getting that the disaster took place on 
his watch, but it turns out this is a dis-
aster of historic proportions. We will 
be reeling from this debacle for years 
and decades to come. 
The President may try to change the 
subject, but the cold truth is that our

S6937 
October 6, 2021 
Nation will be paying the price when 
we are dead and gone and these pages 
are in the position of senior leadership 
in this country. 
Last week, my colleagues and I, on 
the Armed Services Committee, heard 
directly from our Nation’s top military 
leaders who had been advising the 
President on Afghanistan. Their testi-
monies made clear what we had known 
all along, that President Biden not 
only ignored their advice, which he has 
the power to do as Commander in Chief 
of the Armed Forces, but that he then 
misrepresented that advice to the 
American people. 
In a national TV interview, when 
asked whether top military advisers 
had recommended leaving a small 
troop presence behind to keep a lid on 
the situation, which would have kept 
all hell from breaking loose, the Presi-
dent insisted that no one, to his knowl-
edge, had made that recommendation. 
We know that statement by Joe 
Biden was not true. The President got 
good advice, and then incredibly pled 
ignorance. 
He also got good advice from Demo-
crats. And I would point out my col-
league from Rhode Island, Senator 
WHITEHOUSE, 
when 
this 
was 
first 
broached in an open meeting and the 
administration was explaining what 
was going to take place, Senator 
WHITEHOUSE said this sounds like it is 
going to be a lot like the fall of Saigon 
in April of 1974. Senator WHITEHOUSE, 
as the son of a Foreign Service Officer, 
had an all too close recollection of the 
disaster that occurred in Saigon back 
in the seventies, and he warned the ad-
ministration officials that this might 
happen again. 
And yet the President said no one, to 
his knowledge, made this recommenda-
tion or gave these warnings. This is a 
President 
who 
promised 
to 
shoot 
straight with the American people, 
who said in February: ‘‘You can handle 
anything as long as you are told the 
truth.’’ 
I wish the President actually be-
lieved that and subscribed to that and 
lived by that. 
The American people can handle the 
truth, and they need to be told the 
truth. Here is one bit of hard truth 
from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, General Milley: ‘‘Our exit 
from Afghanistan was a ‘strategic fail-
ure.’ ’’ 
From the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs: ‘‘It has caused ‘damage’ to 
America’s credibility.’’ 
That is from the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs. I appreciate him leveling 
with the committee and leveling with 
the American people. 
That damage was on full display this 
past weekend, when the former Afghan 
Ambassador, Adela Raz, was asked by 
Axios: Do you still trust the United 
States? 
Her answer was simple, bleak, and 
understandable: ‘‘No. Sorry.’’ 
That was her answer: ‘‘No. Sorry.’’ 
She does not trust the United States 
anymore. 
This loss of trust extends far beyond 
Afghanistan. As General Milley noted, 
‘‘Our credibility with allies and part-
ners around the world and with adver-
saries is being intensely reviewed by 
them.’’ And he said, yes, ‘‘damaged’’ is 
the correct word. 
Simply put, when we abandon our 
friends, our partners around the world 
start to wonder if they can trust us, if 
we will have their backs. This hurts 
our ability to cooperate with our allies 
to deter threats and to provide security 
for 
the 
American 
people, 
and 
it 
emboldens our adversaries to act more 
aggressively. 
We have already seen this from China 
in the past week. China has been sig-
naling to Taiwan by ramping up their 
air missions near Taiwan. They have 
been signaling to our friends in Taiwan 
that America is an unreliable partner. 
Even before our troops had fully left 
Kabul, Chinese media wasted no time 
predicting that we will also abandon 
friends in Taiwan if and when China in-
vades that country—a matter of con-
cern. 
Will this embolden Iran? Terrorist 
groups in Pakistan who support the 
Taliban remain a serious concern. 
But perhaps the worst breach of trust 
in this dark chapter was between our 
government and our own people. Dur-
ing the withdrawal, President Biden as-
sured us on national television—and I 
quote the President’s grammar—‘‘If 
there is American citizens left in Af-
ghanistan, we’re gonna stay to get 
them all out.’’ 
‘‘If there is American citizens left in 
Afghanistan, we’re gonna stay to get 
them all out.’’ 
Days later, that promise went out 
the window. The President dismissed 
those Americans staying by saying 
many of them wanted to stay in Af-
ghanistan. 
This repeated pattern of broken 
promises and our failure to own these 
decisions will only further weaken our 
country, our alliances, and our na-
tional security. 
Sadly, we must get about the busi-
ness of rehabilitating our reputation 
with our allies and the way our en-
emies and adversaries look at us. 
I stand with my colleagues today 
who are committed to holding this ad-
ministration accountable. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, to-
morrow marks the 20th anniversary of 
the day the United States entered Af-
ghanistan—the beginning of Operation 
Enduring Freedom. 
On October 7, 2001, the U.S. military 
conducted its first strike on the terror-
ists responsible for attacking our Na-
tion on 9/11. 
As President Bush said on that day: 
It was not a mission we asked for but 
a mission that we would fulfill. 
For the past two decades, brave men 
and women have answered the call and 
put on the uniform of our country to 
fight terrorists in the name of freedom. 
We were a beacon of hope in a region of 
chaos. Our presence made a difference. 
As I travel my home State of South 
Dakota, I have heard from many people 
who were disturbed by the events that 
unfolded during our final days in Af-
ghanistan. I share their frustrations. 
Together, we watched the Taliban 
forcefully regain control of an entire 
country that we worked so hard to 
keep free from terrorist groups. We 
watched the credibility of the United 
States on the world’s stage diminish as 
we carelessly left our friends and allies 
behind. We watched civilians hope-
lessly cling to the wings of aircraft in 
desperate hope of escape. And we 
watched 13 brave men and women in 
uniform lose their lives while helping 
others seek freedom. As we mourn the 
loss of their lives, we recognize and ap-
preciate their service to our Nation. 
We also remember all those who 
fought by our side for 20 years, many of 
whom remain trapped in Afghanistan. 
A citizen of South Dakota, Brandy 
Roseland, a veteran from Belle Four-
che, worked as a contractor in Afghani-
stan. That is where she met her inter-
preter. According to Brandy, her inter-
preter served with the highest distinc-
tion and faced great personal risk, 
often putting himself in harm’s way to 
aid and protect Americans and his fel-
low Afghans. 
On one such occasion, Brandy’s inter-
preter discovered an American con-
tractor who died in an accident outside 
of Kabul. The interpreter singlehand-
edly returned the contractor’s body, as 
well as sensitive equipment and docu-
ments, to the U.S. Embassy. That took 
courage. Brandy returned to the United 
States, but she stayed in contact with 
her interpreter. 
When Afghanistan began to fall to 
the Taliban, she knew that she needed 
to do all she could to help him get out 
safely. That is when Brandy called us 
and asked if we could help him escape 
the clutches of the Taliban. 
For weeks, our office worked relent-
lessly to maneuver his application for a 
special immigrant visa throughout the 
bureaucratic process at the State De-
partment. Our work was ultimately 
successful 
from 
an 
administrative 
standpoint, but the overall mission was 
a failure. 
While we had done all we could to 
help the interpreter receive his visa, 
our forces had exited before he could 
get on a plane to safety because of the 
President’s date certain which he set 
for withdrawal. 
Today, this interpreter remains in 
hiding in Afghanistan. If he is found by 
the Taliban, his fate will certainly be 
sealed. 
We all know that there are no easy 
answers when it comes to Afghanistan, 
but there was clearly a wrong one. 
For months, we had warned of the 
perils of making an arbitrary decision 
based on the calendar as opposed to an 
assessment of the conditions on the 
ground. And we weren’t alone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6938 
October 6, 2021 
As the only Republican member of 
both the Armed Services and Foreign 
Relations Committees, I have had the 
opportunity these past few weeks to 
hear from the senior military officers 
who advised President Biden: General 
Milley, Secretary Austin, and General 
McKenzie. Their message to the Presi-
dent was clear: a withdrawal on a date 
certain, without conditions, would lead 
to the fall of Afghanistan to the 
Taliban. 
Despite receiving the best military 
advice in the world, President Biden 
decided to use his own judgment, and 
he made the wrong decision. His direc-
tive to withdraw on a date certain, 
without regard for the conditions on 
the ground, needlessly put American 
soldiers in harm’s way and forced our 
military to undertake an assignment 
which they simply could not totally 
complete. 
Our military simply ran out of time. 
They could not get all of our Ameri-
cans out, and they could not get all of 
our Afghan allies out, including Bran-
dy’s interpreter. 
But it didn’t have to end this way. 
Our military leaders offered the Presi-
dent the correct path forward. Their 
Commander in Chief failed them. 
Lately, the President has blamed a 
lot of people for his failure. This in-
cludes the Afghan security forces and 
his 
own 
generals, 
who 
he 
falsely 
claimed advised him to make this deci-
sion. But this does not fall on any of 
them. 
President Biden owns this debacle, 
and history will not judge him kindly. 
Because of his error, al-Qaida now has 
a breeding ground. America is less safe. 
The world is less safe. 
I will close with a message for our 
veterans. While I was Governor, I at-
tended 31 funerals in South Dakota for 
South Dakotans who died fighting the 
War on Terror. We will not forget their 
sacrifice nor their family’s loss. 
While freedom may not endure in Af-
ghanistan today, for 20 years, you—you 
veterans—you protected our Nation 
and kept the fight away from our door-
step. Your service was not in vain. 
Your sacrifice made a difference. You 
represent the best of our country, and 
your Nation is grateful. 
Please always remember it is not the 
politician who protects our right to 
vote; it is not the journalist who pro-
tects our freedom of speech; and it is 
not the preacher who protects our free-
dom of religion. All of our freedoms are 
defended 
and 
protected, 
generation 
after generation, by the men and 
women who put on the uniform of the 
United States of America. 
We are grateful to you for your sac-
rifice and your service. May God con-
tinue to bless all of you veterans, and 
may the Good Lord continue to bless 
these United States of America. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
NOMINATION OF SARAH A. L. MERRIAM 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate will consider Sarah 
Merriam’s nomination to be a United 
States District Judge for the District 
of Connecticut. I support the nomina-
tion of this highly qualified jurist. 
As a U.S. magistrate judge for over 6 
years, Judge Merriam has presided over 
hundreds of matters, including a num-
ber of trials that proceeded to final 
judgment. She has proven herself to be 
evenhanded, impartial, and mindful of 
the limited role that judges play in our 
system of justice. 
Judge Merriam also has extensive ex-
perience litigating in Federal court— 
both in private practice and as an as-
sistant Federal defender for nearly 8 
years. 
Letters of support the Judiciary 
Committee 
received 
for 
Judge 
Merriam’s nomination underscore the 
widespread respect she has earned for 
her skill, qualifications, temperament, 
and fidelity to the rule of law. The let-
ters came from both Democrats and 
Republicans and from prosecutors and 
defense attorneys. 
Two Republican attorneys who prac-
tice law in Connecticut—Ross Garber, 
who has worked for numerous Repub-
lican officials, and Stanley Twardy, 
Jr., who served as U.S. Attorney in 
Connecticut under President Reagan— 
wrote: ‘‘We are former advisors and ap-
pointees of Republican officials and 
have been involved in the selection and 
vetting of judges. Today we write in 
unqualified support of the nomination 
of Magistrate Judge Sarah Merriam to 
serve as a judge on the United States 
District Court for the District of Con-
necticut.’’ 
They added, ‘‘As a magistrate judge, 
Judge Merriam has been a significant 
and valuable part of the life of the Dis-
trict Court in Connecticut. As a United 
States District Judge she will be a rare 
asset to the District and the judiciary 
as a whole.’’ 
The Judiciary Committee also re-
ceived a letter from 26 former Federal 
prosecutors who served in the District 
of Connecticut. Among them are three 
former U.S. Attorneys. 
These 
former 
prosecutors 
praised 
Judge Merriam as a ‘‘highly qualified 
and competent jurist’’ who ‘‘applies the 
law fairly and properly without regard 
to personal preference.’’ 
They concluded with their assurance 
that Judge Merriam ‘‘will serve with 
distinction and honor’’ in the District 
of Connecticut. 
Judge 
Merriam 
was 
unanimously 
rated ‘‘Well Qualified’’ by the Amer-
ican Bar Association. 
She has the strong support of her 
home 
State 
Senators—Senators 
BLUMENTHAL and MURPHY—and she re-
ceived bipartisan support in the Judici-
ary Committee, with Senators TILLIS 
and GRAHAM joining the Democratic 
members in supporting her nomina-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to join me vot-
ing in support of Judge Merriam’s nom-
ination.

RECOGNIZING U.S. ARMY INTEL-
LIGENCE 
CENTER 
OF 
EXCEL-
LENCE AND FORT HUACHUA 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, Senator 
MARK KELLY and I have the distinct 
privilege of honoring the outstanding 
men and women of the U.S. Army In-
telligence Center of Excellence at Fort 
Huachuca, AZ. On October 6, 2021, MG 
Anthony G. Hale, Commanding General 
of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of 
Excellence and Fort Huachuca, will of-
ficially recognize the 50-year anniver-
sary of Fort Huachuca as the ‘‘Home of 
Military Intelligence.’’ This is a mo-
mentous occasion, and we congratulate 
all members of the Fort Huachuca 
community 
on 
their 
invaluable 
achievements. 
Military intelligence has been crit-
ical to successful combat operations 
since the U.S. Army’s inception in 1775. 
Tragic events in our Nation’s 246-year 
history have continually underscored 
the importance of properly trained in-
telligence professionals, not only for 
combat operations, but in times of 
peace as well. The U.S. Army’s first 
centralized 
peacetime 
intelligence 
school 
was 
established 
at 
Fort 
Holabird, MD, in 1955, but moved to 
Fort Huachuca in 1971 to better meet 
intelligence 
requirements. 
Fort 
Huachuca subsequently received the 
moniker of ‘‘Home of Military Intel-
ligence.’’ 
Over the next 50 years, the U.S. Army 
Intelligence Center and School would 
absorb several other intelligence train-
ing centers until it had responsibility 
for all military intelligence training. 
This includes initial military training 
and professional military education for 
all ranks and intelligence specialties, 
for both Active and Reserve compo-
nents, civilians, and foreign students 
from allied countries. 
The Commanding General serves as 
the proponent for the Military Intel-
ligence Branch and Chief of the Mili-
tary Intelligence Corps and is respon-
sible for recruitment, accession, and 
retention of the Army’s entire military 
intelligence force, while developing 
concepts, doctrine, organizational de-
signs, and materiel solutions. The In-
telligence Center and School have 
gradually morphed into today’s U.S. 
Army Intelligence Center of Excel-
lence, notably becoming the place 
where 
military 
intelligence 
profes-
sionals are symbolically bound to-
gether as one unified organization. It 
continues to be, now more than ever, 
the home of military intelligence. 
As the Army prepares for future con-
tingencies, the work of the U.S. Army 
Intelligence Center of Excellence is 
paramount. The center’s military and 
civilian personnel work tirelessly to 
shape the future of Army intelligence 
while 
ensuring 
intelligence 
profes-
sionals are trained and equipped to pro-
tect our Nation. Fort Huachuca is pos-
tured to combat our adversaries in the 
domains of spectrum and space and 
continues to provide key contributions 
to the defense of the Nation. 
Senator KELLY and I are immensely 
proud of the men and women at the 
U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Ex-
cellence at Fort Huachuca. They de-
serve our deepest gratitude for the con-
tributions they have made to the U.S. 
Army and our Nation over the past 50 
years. I know we both look forward to 
seeing what they accomplish over the 
next half-century. 
Again, congratulations on this proud 
occasion. 
NIOBRARA COUNTY COURTHOUSE 
CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of the centennial 
celebration for the Niobrara County 
Courthouse in Lusk, WY. 
Niobrara 
County 
residents 
are 
blessed to live in this special place. Lo-
cated on the plains and rolling hills of 
eastern Wyoming, the county is a gate-
way to the Black Hills and Central Wy-
oming. Its 2,400 residents center around 
the communities of Lusk, Manville, 
and Van Tassell. The county was cre-
ated from eastern Converse County in 
1911, and Lusk was chosen as the coun-
ty seat when Niobrara County was or-
ganized in 1913. The name of the county 
comes from the Niobrara River, which 
begins its journey east of Lusk. 
Niobrara County’s story is a collec-
tion of the determined and persevering 
people that have called this place home 
for the past century. Its establishment 
was given a physical monument when 
the courthouse was built in 1920. The 
land on which the courthouse sits was 
originally donated by early rancher 
Frank Lusk, as a site to build the new 
town which bears his name. County 
business was first conducted in the Odd 
Fellows Hall, followed by the Harmony 
Lodge. A fire in 1919 destroyed the 
lodge, but not the records kept in a 
steel vault. Operations were moved to 
the basement of the First National 
Bank of Lusk until a new courthouse 
was completed. A white schoolhouse 
was built at the corner of 5th and Elm, 
believed to be the first in Lusk. When 
the courthouse was planned for this lo-
cation, the schoolhouse was split up 
and moved to another block. 
The economy of the new county expe-
rienced an unexpected boom when oil 
was discovered in what became the 
Lance Creek Field. The increase in tax-
able goods prompted the county com-
missioners to propose a bond election 
to fund the construction of a court-
house. On election day, November, 6, 
1918, voters approved a $60,000 bond 
issue by only 29 votes. The commis-
sioners 
chose 
architect 
George 
E. 
McDonald, designer of courthouses in 
Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, to de-
sign the new building. The contracting 
bid was awarded to D.W. Woods. The 
building came in $22,000 over budget, 
and the commissioners again proposed 
a bond election for another $40,000. The 
vote passed by 30 votes this time. 
The building was finished in the win-
ter and occupied in February 1920. It 
was the only courthouse in Wyoming 
with a bronze statue of Justice placed 
on top of the courthouse dome. How-
ever, the statue only stayed there for 
10 years. Strong Wyoming winds caused 
the statue to constantly vibrate and 
shift, which damaged the roof. In 1930, 
commissioners voted to remove the 
statue and replace the roof. The statue 
laid on the ground behind the court-
house, until 1 day it disappeared, only 
to be placed a few days later on a hill 
overlooking the town. It remained

there as a Lusk landmark until it van-
ished from that location as well. Sto-
ries say that some delinquents moved 
it to the bottom of an abandoned mine 
shaft. Rumors abounded in Lusk over 
the following years as to the purpose of 
the statue’s relocation. During World 
War II, the statue resurfaced and was 
donated to a scrap metal campaign for 
the war effort. 
The courthouse was described as, 
‘‘Built of dark red brick with white col-
umned porticoes on the south and east 
entrances, and, of course, with the 
white dome capped by the bronze stat-
ue, the courthouse was the pride of the 
county’s citizens.’’ The Niobrara Coun-
ty Commissioners inscribed on the cor-
nerstone of the building were Fred S. 
Runser, M.J. McCormick, and C.F. Cal-
houn, with E.M. Phillips as the county 
clerk. One of the most prominent fea-
tures of the building is the motto 
above the door, ‘‘A Public Office Is A 
Public Trust.’’ This defining feature, 
which remains there today, is an in-
spiring reminder to all those who work 
in the county and in Wyoming. The 
current county commissioners tasked 
with upholding this ideal are Patrick 
H. Wade, John Midkiff, and Elaine B. 
Griffith, with Becky Freeman as coun-
ty clerk. 
On Friday, October 15, 2021, the 
Niobrara County Commissioners are 
hosting a celebration for the court-
house’s centennial. A dedication cere-
mony will take place at this event as 
one was not preformed upon its origi-
nal construction. The Niobrara County 
Historical Society purchased a sign 
commemorating the courthouse and 
providing historic information. It will 
be a wonderful celebration of Lusk and 
the Niobrara County community. 
Niobrara County has a storied and 
colorful past. Its people stand as an ex-
ample of strong character and neigh-
borliness and its courthouse a symbol 
of their ideals. Bobbi joins me in cele-
brating the centennial of the Niobrara 
County Courthouse and the citizens 
who make this county special.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DANIEL W. 
CROWLEY 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to pay 
tribute to Daniel W. Crowley, a re-
markable patriot, war hero, role model, 
and public servant. Dan passed away on 
September 16, 2021, at the age of 99. 
Dan was born in 1922 and raised in 
Greenwich, CT. He lived through the 
Great Depression and enlisted in Octo-
ber 1940 in the U.S. Army Air Corps. In 
March 1941, he was sent to the Phil-
ippines and assigned to Nichols Field, 
which 
was 
destroyed 
by 
Japanese 
forces the day after the attack on 
Pearl Harbor. 
In the following months, Dan fought 
with the U.S. Army’s Provisional Air 
Corps Infantry Regiment to fend off 
three amphibious Japanese landings on 
the Bataan Peninsula. On April 9, 1942, 
the peninsula was surrendered, and 
Dan swam to Corregidor Island through 
shark-infested waters. Upon arrival, he 
became part of the 4th Marines, where 
they fought valiantly to maintain the 
shore, until the fortress fell on May 6, 
1942. 
In 1944, following several brutal work 
details in the Philippines, Dan was sent 
to Japan on a hell ship. In the many 
months that followed, Dan mined cop-
per as a slave laborer. Surviving the 
harsh, demanding conditions, he was fi-
nally liberated on September 4, 1945. 
After, in 1958, Dan joined North-
western Mutual insurance. His acumen 
and quick wits earned him fast recogni-
tion as one of the company’s top pro-
ducers, and he even became a member 
of their million dollar club. 
Dan 
has 
demonstrated 
an 
out-
standing commitment to preserving 
the memory of his fellow soldiers. In 
2013, he played a key role in renaming 
a bridge in Simsbury, CT, the ‘‘Bataan 
Corregidor Memorial Bridge’’ in their 
honor. I had the privilege of meeting 
Dan at the dedication for this bridge, 
and I can attest firsthand to what a re-
markable model of public service he is. 
The next year, Dan returned to Japan 
as part of the fifth Japanese-American 
POW Friendship Program. Furukawa 
executives refused to meet with him, 
but he was given the opportunity to 
visit one of the mines where he had 
previously worked. Later, in 2016, Dan 
attended the Veterans’ Day breakfast 
hosted by President Obama at the 
White House. 
I have been fortunate to visit with 
Dan on a number of occasions since our 
initial meeting. My office and I as-
sisted him with obtaining a prisoner of 
war registration for his license plate in 
recognition of his extraordinary serv-
ice to our country. I also had the honor 
of speaking with Dan and meeting his 
wife, Kelley, this year. On January 4, 
2021, I attended a ceremony at Bradley 
Air National Guard Base, where Dan 
was promoted to sergeant and received 
an 
honorary 
Combat 
Infantryman 
Badge and the Prisoner of War Medal. 
It was a poignant and powerful mo-
ment. 
My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our 
deepest sympathies to Dan’s family 
during this difficult time. May their 
many wonderful memories of Dan pro-
vide them solace and comfort in the 
days ahead.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO THE MARRS FAMILY 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Dave and Jenny 
Marrs of Bentonville, AR, on being 
named National Angels in Adoption 
honorees by the Congressional Coali-
tion on Adoption Institute, CCAI. 
The CCAI is celebrating its 20th anni-
versary this year, and I was honored to 
nominate Dave and Jenny for their 
work to support and promote adoption 
and other critical services for children 
in Arkansas and around the world. 
Since 2001, the CCAI has played a 
vital 
role 
in 
eliminating 
barriers 
standing between orphaned and foster 
children becoming part of a loving fam-
ily. As the CCAI’s signature public 
awareness program, Angels in Adoption 
annually recognizes outstanding indi-
viduals, families, and organizations 
that have made extraordinary con-
tributions to adoption and child wel-
fare. 
Dave and Jenny are the parents of 
five children, including Sylvie whom 
they adopted from the Democratic Re-
public of the Congo. They had always 
known they wanted to adopt and, in 
2012, began the process to make Sylvie 
part of their family. It only took a few 
months for Sylvie to legally became 
their child, but the couple had no idea 
how difficult it would be to bring her 
home to Arkansas when international 
challenges brought the process to a 
halt. Shortly after their visit to the 
Congo, the Congolese Government shut 
down adoptions. Dave and Jenny were 
devasted, 
but 
the 
hardships 
only 
strengthened their resolve to rescue 
their daughter. It was during that 
process that my office first met the 
Marrs family, and I am pleased we were 
able to advocate for them with the U.S. 
State Department and Embassy offi-
cials. After more than 600 days, their 
Sylvie finally arrived home. 
Inspired by their newest addition to 
the family, Dave and Jenny developed 
a passion for orphan care, family pres-
ervation, and adoption. The family 
started a nonprofit blueberry farm in 
northwest Arkansas as a way to help 
fund a program to educate orphaned 
and at-risk teenage boys in Marondera, 
Zimbabwe. They also advocate for chil-
dren in need, including working closely 
with the philanthropic organization 
Help One Now to empower families in 
developing nations through capable 
local leaders. 
The Marrs family has traveled the 
world to see firsthand the extreme pov-
erty and truly dark circumstances fac-
ing parentless children around the 
globe. While visiting the Congo, the 
couple witnessed extreme starvation in 
the orphanage where their daughter 
Sylvie was living. This shocked Dave 
and Jenny, launching them into action. 
They organized an online raffle to raise 
money to feed the kids and their pro-
gram was so successful it was able to 
feed three orphanages for an entire 
month. The Marrses have also used 
their platform on their hit HGTV show 
‘‘Fixer to Fabulous’’ to help spread 
awareness about adoption and share 
their journey with viewers. 
It was a privilege to nominate Dave 
and Jenny for their exemplary work 
that led to this well-deserved national 
honor, and I believe I speak for all Ar-
kansans when I say they have made our 
State incredibly proud. They join influ-
ential and deserving members of this 
community, including Mohammed Ali 
and First Lady Laura Bush, as recipi-
ents of this important recognition. I 
am grateful for the life-changing ef-
forts Dave and Jenny Marrs, as well as

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUN-
DATION FIGHTING BLINDNESS 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to recognize the 50th anniversary 
of the Foundation Fighting Blindness. 
This Maryland-based nonprofit has be-
come the world’s leading private source 
of research funding to save and restore 
vision for individuals affected by blind-
ing retinal diseases like macular de-
generation, retinitis pigmentosa, and 
Usher syndrome. These conditions cur-
rently affect more than 10 million 
Americans—and 
millions 
more 
throughout the world. 
Even though the foundation has a 
global reach, its origins are local. In 
1971, a Maryland family learned that 
two of their three daughters were going 
blind. At the time, there was no treat-
ment for blindness and few resources 
for the blind; the family was only told 
to teach their daughters Braille. De-
spite these challenging circumstances, 
this brave family banded together with 
friends and community members to or-
ganize a movement around those strug-
gling with blindness. These early ef-
forts paved the way for the establish-
ment of the foundation we know today. 
Since its creation, the foundation has 
raised over $800 million to support cut-
ting-edge research at the vanguard of 
the fight to cure blindness. Their ef-
forts have identified more than 270 
genes that cause retinal diseases and 
led to more than 40 clinical trials for 
potential sight-saving and sight-restor-
ing therapies. The first-ever FDA-ap-
proved gene therapy for inherited ret-
inal research was made possible thanks 
to $10 million in funding from the foun-
dation. This innovative treatment has 
enabled children and young adults born 
virtually blind to see the faces of their 
parents and even gaze at stars in the 
sky. 
The millions of dollars raised by this 
organization have already helped make 
big strides in the area of blindness re-
search, but the foundation’s work is far 
from over. Today, the foundation con-
tinues to invest in new frontiers of dis-
covery. Their funding is fueling efforts 
by major biotech and pharmaceutical 
companies to move more therapies 
from the lab bench to clinical trials 
and, 
hopefully, 
treatments. 
And 
through its unwavering commitment 
and persistence, the foundation raised 
the funds to establish the first ever 
interdisciplinary laboratory dedicated 
to research for inherited retinal dis-
eases, which will serve as an engine of 
future discoveries and advancements. 
The foundation’s work inspires us all, 
and I ask my colleagues to join me in 
commending the founders and leaders 
of the Foundation Fighting Blindness 
on their 50 years of innovative work 
transforming the lives of millions 
around the world.∑

Ms. SMITH (for herself, Mr. HOEVEN, 
Ms. BALDWIN, Ms. ERNST, Mr. GRASS-
LEY, and Mr. WYDEN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 408 
Whereas, during the global COVID–19 pan-
demic, cooperatives have taken extraor-
dinary steps to serve their member-owners 
and communities; 
Whereas a cooperative— 
(1) is a business that is owned and governed 
by its members, who are the individuals who 
use the business, create the products of the 
business, or manage the operation of the 
business; and 
(2) operates under the 7 principles of— 
(A) voluntary open membership; 
(B) democratic control; 
(C) owner economic participation; 
(D) autonomy and independence; 
(E) education, training, and information; 
(F) cooperation among cooperatives; and 
(G) concern for community; 
Whereas cooperative entrepreneurs can be 
found in almost every economic sector of the 
United States, throughout all 50 States and 
territories, and in every congressional dis-
trict of the United States; 
Whereas cooperatives help farmers in-
crease incomes and become more resilient to 
economic business cycles by working to-
gether to plan and prepare for the future, 
while contributing significantly to the eco-
nomic activity in the agriculture and food 
markets of the United States; 
Whereas the roughly 1,800 agricultural co-
operatives in the United States operate more 
than 8,000 facilities, employ $96,000,000,000 
worth 
of 
assets, 
and 
generate 
nearly 
$204,000,000,000 in business annually; 
Whereas the majority of the 2,000,000 farm-
ers in the United States belong to an agricul-
tural cooperative; 
Whereas agricultural cooperatives offer 
members the opportunity to access com-
modity value-added profits throughout the 
handling, 
processing, 
and 
distribution 
chains; 
Whereas member-owners of agricultural 
cooperatives are dedicated to providing the 
highest quality product for consumers; 
Whereas agricultural cooperatives add sig-
nificant benefits to the economic well-being 
of rural areas of the United States by pro-
viding more than 250,000 jobs with annual 
wages totaling more than $8,000,000,000; 
Whereas agricultural cooperatives provide 
resources to their member-owners, such as 
low-cost supplies, effective marketing, and 
services; 
Whereas farmer members of agricultural 
cooperatives have the opportunity to pool re-
sources and reinvest profits into the commu-
nities of the farmer members; 
Whereas the principles of cooperation and 
the 
cooperative 
business 
model 
help 
smallholder farmers organize themselves and 
gain access to local and global markets, 
training, improved inputs, and aggregated 
sales and marketing; 
Whereas the cooperative business model 
provides farmers ownership over their eco-
nomic decisions, a focus on learning, and a 
broader understanding of environmental and 
social concerns; 
Whereas the cooperative business model 
has been used throughout the history of the 
United States to advance civil rights and to 
help ensure that all individuals have equal 
access to economic opportunity; 
Whereas the comprehensive global food se-
curity strategy established under section 5 of 
the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (22 
U.S.C. 9304) (commonly known as ‘‘Feed the 
Future’’) and the Cooperative Development 
Program of the United States Agency for 
International Development use cooperative 
principles 
and 
the 
cooperative 
business 
model to advance international develop-
ment, nutrition, resilience, and economic se-
curity; 
Whereas the Interagency Working Group 
on Cooperative Development— 
(1) is an interagency group that is coordi-
nated and chaired by the Secretary of Agri-
culture to foster cooperative development 
and ensure coordination with Federal agen-
cies and national and local cooperative orga-
nizations that have cooperative programs 
and interests; and 
(2) as of the date of introduction of this 
resolution, had organized 4 meetings; 
Whereas the bipartisan Congressional Co-
operative Business Caucus unites Members of 
Congress to— 
(1) create a better-informed electorate and 
a more educated public on the important 
role that cooperatives play in the economy 
of the United States and the world; 
(2) 
promote 
the 
cooperative 
business 
model, because that model ensures that con-
sumers have access to high-quality goods 
and services at competitive prices and costs 
that improve the lives of individuals, fami-
lies, and their communities; and

(3) address and correct awareness chal-
lenges among the public and within the Fed-
eral Government relating to what coopera-
tives look like, who participates in coopera-
tives, where cooperatives are located, and 
why individuals choose cooperatives; 
Whereas the Bureau of the Census, as part 
of the 2017 Economic Census, asked each 
business if the business was organized as a 
cooperative, and the responses of businesses 
yielded both quantitative and qualitative 
data on the effects and importance of co-
operatives across the economy of the United 
States; 
Whereas, throughout rural areas of the 
United States, many utility service pro-
viders operate as cooperatives and are tasked 
with the delivery of public services, such as 
electricity, water, telecommunications, and 
broadband, in areas where investor-owned 
utility companies typically do not operate; 
Whereas utility cooperatives have inno-
vated to meet the evolving needs of their 
member-owners and help rural individuals in 
the United States prosper; 
Whereas, in the financial services sector, 
cooperatives, including credit unions, farm 
credit banks, and other financing organiza-
tions that lend to cooperatives, provide nu-
merous benefits to the member-owners of 
those cooperatives; 
Whereas member-owners of cooperatives 
vote in board elections, and earned profits 
cycle back into cost-saving programs or re-
turn as dividend payments; 
Whereas purchasing and shared service co-
operatives allow independent and franchise 
businesses to thrive; 
Whereas food cooperatives range in size 
from small, local buying clubs to multi-store 
regional giants that compete with chain 
stores with locations across the United 
States; 
Whereas, in the housing sector, housing co-
operatives and resident-owned communities 
in which members own the building or land— 
(1) are an alternative to conventional rent-
al apartments, manufactured home parks, 
and condominiums; and 
(2) empower each resident with ownership 
and responsibility; 
Whereas housing cooperatives have roots 
dating to the late 1800s and are increasingly 
becoming a housing alternative for students 
at colleges throughout the United States; 
Whereas shared equity housing coopera-
tives are a critical option for preserving 
long-term, affordable housing; 
Whereas cooperatives allow residents of 
manufactured home communities to collec-
tively purchase the land on which they live, 
providing stability and the opportunity to 
self-govern; 
Whereas, as of 2019, not less than 1,000 
manufactured home communities were resi-
dent-owned, accounting for approximately 2 
percent of all manufactured home commu-
nities; 
Whereas the growth of worker cooperatives 
in the United States is allowing more work-
ers to own and have greater control over 
their businesses; 
Whereas many small businesses convert to 
cooperatives when faced with closure or a 
buyout, ensuring the business can continue 
to serve its community; and 
Whereas the cooperative business model al-
lows business owners to retire and transfer 
business ownership to employees or con-
sumers, protecting local ownership and sup-
porting local communities: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates October 2021 as ‘‘National 
Co-op Month’’; 
(2) commends the cooperative business 
model for— 
(A) its contributions to the economy; 
(B) the jobs it creates; and 
(C) its positive impacts on local commu-
nities; 
(3) expresses confidence in, and support for, 
cooperatives to continue their successes; and 
(4) will be mindful in crafting legislation 
that affects business models that are not the 
cooperative business model so that the legis-
lation does not adversely affect the coopera-
tive business model.

SENATE RESOLUTION 409—DESIG-
NATING THE WEEK BEGINNING 
OCTOBER 17, 2021, AS ‘‘NATIONAL 
CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK’’ 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Ms. 
STABENOW, Mrs. CAPITO, Ms. WARREN, 
Mr. 
BRAUN, 
Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, 
Mr. 
LANKFORD, and Mr. WARNOCK) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 409 
Whereas the well-being of the United 
States requires that the young people of the 
United States become an involved, caring 
citizenry of good character; 
Whereas the character education of chil-
dren has become more urgent, as violence by 
and against youth increasingly threatens the 
physical and psychological well-being of the 
people of the United States; 
Whereas, more than ever, children need 
strong and constructive guidance from their 
families and their communities, including 
from schools, youth organizations, religious 
institutions, and civic groups; 
Whereas the character of a nation is only 
as strong as the character of its individual 
citizens; 
Whereas the public good is advanced when 
young individuals are taught the importance 
of good character and the positive effects 
that good character can have in personal re-
lationships, in school, and in the workplace; 
Whereas scholars and educators agree that 
individuals do not automatically develop 
good character and that, therefore, institu-
tions and individuals that influence youth 
must make conscientious efforts to help 
young individuals develop the essential 
traits and characteristics that comprise good 
character; 
Whereas, although character development 
is, first and foremost, an obligation of fami-
lies, 
the 
efforts 
of 
faith 
communities, 
schools, and youth, civic, and human service 
organizations also play an important role in 
fostering and promoting good character; 
Whereas Congress encourages students, 
teachers, parents, youth, and community 
leaders to recognize the importance of char-
acter education in preparing young individ-
uals to play a role in determining the future 
of the United States; 
Whereas effective character education is 
based on core ethical values, which form the 
foundation of a democratic society; 
Whereas examples of character are trust-
worthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, 
caring, citizenship, and honesty; 
Whereas elements of character transcend 
cultural, religious, and socioeconomic dif-
ferences; 
Whereas the character and conduct of 
youth reflect the character and conduct of 
society, and, therefore, every adult has the 
responsibility to teach and model ethical 
values and every social institution has the 
responsibility to promote the development of 
good character; 
Whereas Congress encourages individuals 
and organizations, especially those that have 
an interest in the education and training of 
the young individuals in the United States, 
to adopt the elements of character as intrin-
sic to the well-being of individuals, commu-
nities, and society; 
Whereas many schools in the United States 
recognize the need, and have taken steps, to 
integrate the values of their communities 
into teaching activities; and 
Whereas the establishment of ‘‘National 
Character Counts Week’’, during which indi-
viduals, families, schools, youth organiza-
tions, religious institutions, civic groups, 
and other organizations focus on character 
education, is of great benefit to the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week beginning October 
17, 2021, as ‘‘National Character Counts 
Week’’; and 
(2) calls upon the people of the United 
States and interested groups— 
(A) to embrace the elements of character 
identified by local schools and communities, 
such as trustworthiness, respect, responsi-
bility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and 
(B) to observe National Character Counts 
Week with appropriate ceremonies, pro-
grams, and activities.
