PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord our God, You are our strength 
and our song. By Your mighty hand, 
You have brought us to this moment in 
time that our lives would sing Your 
praises. 
As we begin the day, cause us to re-
flect on the countless times You have 
upheld us through chaos and calamity, 
those moments when we had nothing 
left in our own reserves but could only 
draw on Your strength to see us 
through. Then may those reminders of 
Your abiding presence remain with us 
during the events and challenges in 
store for us today. Would that we look 
to You and the encouragement, moti-
vation, and inspiration You provide for 
us in both the obvious and the more 
subtle gifts of grace You offer. 
May we see Your face in all things 
and thus be empowered to meet You in 
all the things we face. 
We can do all things through the one 
who strengthens us. May this serve as 
our refrain this day. 
In the power of Your name, we pray 
to serve You faithfully. 
Amen.

by members of the Phillips family since 1948. 
In 1930, the Diner got its start as the Theater 
Dining Car and was owned by M&F Dining 
Corp. The restaurant quickly became a favor-
ite dining spot for those seeing a movie at the 
Strand Theater located next door. In 1948, 
Russell and Ollie Phillips purchased the The-
ater Dining Car with their son, Bud, and re-
named it Phillips Diner. Phillips Diner was ex-
tremely successful for several decades, until a 
devastating fire destroyed the building in 1970. 
Not discouraged by this setback, the Phillips 
family rebuilt and opened once again in 1973, 
proudly serving their community ever since. 
The Diner is now owned and operated by 
Judi Ashley, the granddaughter of the original 
owners, and her husband. Over seventy years 
later, the diner staff still use Russell and 
Ollie’s original recipes to prepare their famous 
dishes. Phillips Diner is a true community sta-
ple priding themselves on serving great meals 
at a great value. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I am 
proud to celebrate the rich history of Phillips 
Diner. This establishment has been an impor-
tant asset to the Ogdensburg community for 
several decades and will undoubtedly continue 
to provide service for many more to come. 
Congratulations to Phillips Diner for their rec-
ognition on the New York State Historic Pres-
ervation Registry.

Friday, June 3, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Haley Biskup of Whitehouse, Ohio, has been 
offered an appointment to the United States 
Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo-
rado. 
Haley’s offer of appointment permits her to 
attend the United States Air Force Academy 
this fall with the incoming Class of 2026. At-
tending one of our Nation’ s military acad-
emies offers the opportunity to serve our 
country and receive a world-class education. 
At the same time, these young men and 
women undertake one of the most challenging 
and rewarding experiences of their lives. 
Haley brings a tremendous amount of lead-
ership, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2026. While attending Open Door 
Christian School in Elyria, Ohio, Haley partici-
pated in Patriot Service Club, was a student 
ambassador, and was a member of National 
Honor Society. Throughout high school, Haley 
was involved with volleyball, basketball, and 
cheerleading, earning a varsity letter in all 
three. 
After 
graduating 
Open 
Door 
Christian 
School in 2020, Haley attended Lorain County 
Community College in Elyria, Ohio and studied 
science. She then went on to attend the 
United States Air Force Academy Preparatory 
School in Colorado. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Haley Biskup on her offer 
of appointment to the United States Air Force 
Academy. Our service academies offer the fin-
est military training and education available. I 
am positive that Haley will excel during her ca-
reer at the Air Force Academy, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in extending their best 
wishes to her as she begins her service to our 
Nation.

RECOGNIZING DOMINION WOMAN’S 
CLUB 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to use this time to recognize the 15th an-
niversary of the General Federation of Wom-
en’s Clubs Dominion Woman’s Club (DWC) in 
Virginia’s 10th District. The DWC is a volun-
teer organization in Prince William and Fau-
quier Counties that is dedicated to improving 
our community by advocating for critical issues 
and providing volunteer services. Some of the 
DWC’s work has involved supporting our 
schools and libraries, meeting the needs of 
the underserved, calling attention to the prob-
lems of child and domestic abuse, and work-
ing to promote conservation through volunteer 
service. 
The DWC was founded in 2007 under the 
guidance of the General Federation of Wom-
en’s Clubs of Virginia (GFWC–VA). The 
GFWC–VA, founded in 1890, focuses on pro-
moting culture and education, increasing do-
mestic abuse awareness, and establishing 
smaller, local clubs across Virginia. The 
DWC’s first President was Nanette McKeel 
Petrella, and many current members credit the 
club’s early success to her leadership and vi-
sion. 
Today, the DWC supports a wide variety of 
organizations and groups across Prince Wil-
liam and Fauquier Counties, including Bull 
Run Mountain Conservancy, Leopold’s Pre-
serve, the Haymarket Regional Food Pantry, 
PACE West School, Suella Gilbert Ellis Ele-
mentary, Gravely Elementary, Friends of 
Homeless Animals and more. The members of 
the club come from a variety of backgrounds, 
including teachers, counselors, professional 
women, moms, and women involved in var-
ious communal volunteer organizations. While 
their levels of participation and interests may 
vary, each member shares the common goal 
of empowering one another through commu-
nity service. 
The club’s current board, led by President 
Martha Feeney, has done an admirable job of 
guiding the club during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. She implemented creative methods to 
navigate remote outreach and ensured that 
the club’s community impact remained resil-
ient. Under their leadership in 2021, the club 
participated in 42 volunteer programs, contrib-
uted 4,734 volunteer hours, and donated over 
$20,000, including in-kind donations, to fund 
their community outreaches. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating the GFWC Dominion 
Woman’s Club for its steadfast commitment to 
serving our community for the past 15 years. 
I wish the women of this entire organization all 
the best in their future endeavors and com-
mend their desire to ‘‘be the change that you 
wish to see.’’

HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend and congratulate Stephane 
Camacho Concepcion on being selected as 
the 2023 Guam Department of Education 
(GDOE) Teacher of the Year. Stephane is an 
exceptional teacher whose passion for service, 
dedication to our youth, and commitment to 
holistic community growth have and continue 
to leave a lasting impact on our people, island, 
and future. 
The prestigious Teacher of the Year Pro-
gram has recognized teachers in Guam since 
1969 for their excellence in teaching and con-
tributions to community. In addition to high-
lighting both teachers’ extraordinary work and 
the importance of a quality education system, 
the national platform provides educators with 
unique opportunities to represent and lead our 
district in elevating its classroom standards 
and practices. After a rigorous nomination,

Stephane was selected from among six final-
ists and now joins a cohort of esteemed 
teachers from across the nation as Talofofo 
Elementary School’s first award recipient in 52 
years. 
Early in life, Stephane understood the value 
of education; growing up, her mother, grand-
parents, and mentors made it a point to em-
phasize that learning should be a priority. Yet 
it wasn’t just a lesson she was told—it is a 
fundamental truth she witnessed firsthand. As 
a young girl, Stephane routinely helped pre-
pare her aunt’s classroom for the new school 
year and saw how her dedication outside of it 
deeply affected the lives of her students. 
Stephane’s first-grade teacher also drew com-
pelling connections between education and 
fun that further nurtured her love for learning 
and desire to make a difference. Paired with 
her aspirations for purpose-driven service, 
these 
formative 
experiences 
propelled 
Stephane onto a path that similarly shapes 
children’s educational journeys. After receiving 
her high school diploma at the Guam Commu-
nity College, she earned a bachelor’s degree 
in Early Childhood and Elementary Education 
from the University of Guam (UOG). She then 
returned to the university and went on to ob-
tain two master’s degrees in both Administra-
tion & Supervision and Reading. 
Today, Stephane celebrates over 16 years 
of teaching with GDOE and as demonstrated 
throughout her career, she has and continues 
to both redefine and reimagine the vital role of 
a teacher in empowering communities. Be-
yond ensuring her students are adequately 
supported with uniquely tailored instructional 
styles and assistance, her leadership within 
the larger school system has meaningfully 
contributed to improving the learning experi-
ence for countless Guam students. As both a 
curriculum coordinator and school site instruc-
tional coach, Stephane has extensively col-
laborated with educators across the island, ad-
vocated for the evolving needs of our children, 
and worked diligently to stand up a robust 
school community by cultivating greater rela-
tionships and communication with parents, 
faculty, staff, and students. 
On behalf of the People of Guam, I would 
like to extend a sincere congratulations to 
Stephane Camacho Concepcion. Her unwav-
ering commitment to collaboration, collective 
progress, and student-centered success both 
underscores the criticality of education for all 
and inspires learners and educators alike to 
similarly rise as catalysts for positive trans-
formation. Stephane’s selflessness, passion, 
and determination to meet students where 
they are to best help them get to where they 
can and dream to be offers renewed hope in 
the achievements we can realize through 
heart and hard work, and I wish her the best 
on the rest of her professional journey.

HONORING THE LIFE OF J. ROY 
ROWLAND 
HON. RICK W. ALLEN 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I’d like to pay 
my respects to the late J. Roy Rowland, a pil-
lar of our community who passed away on 
April 25, 2022, returning home to the Lord 
after 96 years of a life well lived. 
Dr. Rowland was born in Wrightsville, Geor-
gia in 1926. He served as a sergeant in the 
United States Army during World War II and 
practiced medicine in the middle Georgia area 
for 28 years. 
Dr. Rowland later served his community 
both in the Georgia state legislature and the 
United States Congress, representing Geor-
gia’s Eighth District from 1983 to 1995, which 
included counties in today’s Twelfth District. 
Dr. Rowland was blessed with a servant’s 
heart—a truth known well by his constituents, 
family, and all who were fortunate enough to 
call him ‘‘friend.’’ 
Dr. Rowland’s passion for service persisted 
for decades after his retirement from Con-
gress. 
Ask any Member who followed him, and 
they will tell you they often fielded calls from 
Dr. Rowland seeking assistance with a con-
stituent issue, tour request, or requesting sup-
port on a local issue. 
Such was his lifelong dedication to the com-
munity. 
In Galatians 5:13, the apostle Paul calls on 
us to serve another in love. We serve God by 
serving others. 
Few men have heeded the apostle’s call 
more thoroughly or more happily than Dr. 
Rowland during his 96 years on earth. 
A true public servant, may he rest in peace.

HONORING BILL JONES 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize Mr. Bill Jones, the former Execu-
tive Director of the Melissa Area Chamber of 
Commerce. Following a distinguished thirty- 
eight-year career in public service, a grateful 
community thanks Mr. Jones for his leadership 
and dedication. 
Prior to role with the Melissa Area Chamber 
of Commerce, Bill served for an impressive 
thirty years as President and Executive Direc-
tor of chambers and economic development 
organizations in various municipalities includ-
ing those of Grove, Oklahoma; Branson, Mis-
souri; Dumas, Texas; Rosenberg-Richmond, 
Texas; and Bonham, Texas. Bill’s steadfast 
leadership generated financial and member-
ship growth in each of these organizations en-
hancing their effectiveness and ability to serve 
members of the community. 
Mr. Jones would go on to enjoy a brief two- 
year retirement in Bonham, Texas where he 
spent his time managing the Fannin County 
Multi-Purpose Complex, a facility which he 
was instrumental in developing. 
Shortly after moving to Melissa, Texas, on 
January 6, 2014, Bill would come out of retire-
ment to begin his tenure as the Executive Di-
rector of the Melissa Area Chamber of Com-
merce. Due to his vast knowledge and experi-
ence in economic development, he would 
guide the Chamber during a pivotal time of 
rapid growth. 
Bill Jones is highly esteemed within the 
community as evidenced by his election as the 
first President of the Trails of Melissa Home-
owners Association, appointment to the Texas 
Chamber of Commerce and Business Execu-
tives, and role as the Community Partner for 
McKinney Buick GMC. 
Now as he enters retirement, I ask my col-
leagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in commending Bill Jones for his many 
efforts and his dedication to serving the Me-
lissa business community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF KAREN SMITH 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember the incredible 
life of Karen S. Smith of Gloversville, New 
York. Karen was an active member of the Ful-
ton County community, and she will be dearly 
missed by all who had the pleasure of know-
ing her. 
Karen was born on December 22, 1946 in 
Indiana. She graduated from Gloversville High 
School and attended SUNY Brockport. Karen 
then obtained her master’s degree in reading 
education from the College of St. Rose. After 
graduation, Karen began her career as a 
teacher dedicated to serving some of the 
youngest members of the Fulton County com-
munity. She taught at many schools through-
out New York, including Mt. Carmel Elemen-
tary 
School, 
in 
the 
former 
Oppenheim- 
Ephratah Central School District, the Tryon 
School, and in the Greater Amsterdam School 
District. Karen’s commitment to improving her 
community was evident through her teaching, 
and Fulton County is better off because of her 
service. 
Karen was an integral part of the Fulton 
County Republican Committee for over twenty- 
five years. During that time, she served as the 
committee secretary, a state committeeman, 
and the chairwoman of the Gloversville City 
Committee, She also loyally served as the 
president of Fulton County Women’s Repub-
lican Committee and as the president of the 
New York State Federation of Republican 
Women. Additionally, Karen was an active 
member in the Fulton County Republican 
Chairman’s Club and the Fulton County Re-
publican Club. Karen brought much needed 
leadership to all of her roles and shared her 
extensive expertise with the Republican Party 
of New York. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
thank and honor Karen Smith for her incred-
ible life of service and extend my deepest con-
dolences to her family, friends, and the entire 
Fulton County community.

Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life, memory, and leg-
acy of a great Californian and one of the great 
philanthropists in California’s 25th District,

community, a loving wife, and an amazing 
mother, Charlotte exemplified what it means to 
give back and live your life in the service of 
others.

June 3, 2022 
Like many who are blessed to call the 25th 
District home, Charlotte was not a native of 
Santa Clarita. Born in Chicago and raised in 
North Hollywood, she came to Santa Clarita in 
1965 with her family, where she wasted no 
time in immersing herself in the philanthropic 
community. Throughout her life, she served on 
the board of the local Child and Family Cen-
ter, Boys and Girls Club, Foundation for Chil-
dren’s Dental Health, and Samuel Dixon Fam-
ily Health Center, in addition to serving on the 
Foundation committee for College of the Can-
yons and as an ambassador to the local 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Both Charlotte and her late husband Frank, 
were recognized as Santa Clarita’s Woman 
and Man of the Year in 1996 and 2002, re-
spectively. Even after earning this prestigious 
award recognizing her lifetime of contribution 
to charitable causes in her community, she 
was still driven to continue finding ways to 
give back in any way that she could. Her con-
tributions to the many non-profits and organi-
zations in our valley are immeasurable, and 
our city is a better place because of her ef-
forts. 
I have long held the belief that charity is one 
of the most important moral cornerstones of 
our great nation. There are few things more 
honorable than living your life in the service of 
others, and Charlotte Kleeman is the bench-
mark for what it means to give back, help oth-
ers, and blaze a trail of light that touches 
countless lives. We will always remember her 
service to the Santa Clarita Valley, and we will 
continue to honor her memory through acts of 
charity and by helping those in need.

APPOINTMENT TO ATTEND THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
MILITARY

HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Marc Baroncini of Perrysburg, Ohio, has been 
offered an appointment to the United States 
Military Academy in West Point, New York. 
Marc’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Military Academy this

one of our Nation’s military academies offers 
the opportunity to serve our country and re-
ceive a world-class education. At the same 
time, these young men and women undertake 
one of the most challenging and rewarding ex-
periences of their lives. 
Marc brings a tremendous amount of lead-
ership, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2026. While attending Perrysburg 
High School in Perrysburg, Ohio, Marc partici-
pated in community service for Zoar Lutheran 
Church. He competed in cross country and

tary Academy. Our service academies offer 
the finest military training and education avail-
able. I am positive that Marc will excel during

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF LT. 
JIMMY ‘‘COTTON’’ MCCOY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Lt. Jimmy L. ‘‘Cotton’’ McCoy, Retd., a deco-
rated veteran of the Vietnam War who folded 
his earthly tent and transformed to eternal rest 
on Monday morning, May 23, 2022, after a pe-
riod of declining health. Cotton, as he was uni-
versally known, was born the third of six chil-
dren to Noel and Katie Putt McCoy. Growing 
up on Canal St. in east Tupelo, he attended 
Lawhon School, graduated from Tupelo High 
School in 1965 and attended ICC for two 
years. 
Cotton answered the call of his country and 
served in the U.S. Army during the heart of 
the Vietnam War. He was a mortar man with 
the 173rd Airborne Division and a paratrooper. 
For his bravery and courage, he received 
many medals including the Bronze Star—de-
clining a Purple Heart because he felt others 
deserved it more than he. Determined to con-
tinue in public service, Cotton graduated from 
the Miss. Law Enforcement Academy and be-
came a police officer for the City of Tupelo. 
For 35 years, Cotton became a beloved figure 
among the citizens as a motorcycle cop and 
street patrolman. He always tempered justice 
with mercy whenever possible and was a 
strong mentor/teacher for many young people 
who just needed a steady force and guidance 
to get back on track in life. 
Cotton retired in 2006 with the rank of Lieu-
tenant. A great southern storyteller, Cotton en-
deared himself to family and friends with his 
yams and clever personality. He never met a 
stranger and loved being a citizen of Tupelo 
and Lee County. Cotton was a lifelong mem-
ber of the East Heights Baptist Church, a 
Mason and Shriner, an avid gardener and gun 
collector. 
Cotton was a dedicated servant of God, 
country, and state. My prayers will be with 
those mourning his loss.

REMEMBERING JOHN A. DUTRA 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
along with Representatives KHANNA and LOF-
GREN, to recognize the life of John A. Dutra, 
former member of the California State Legisla-
ture, Vice Mayor, and 10-year member of the 
Fremont City Council, who passed away on 
May 29, 2022. 
A son of immigrants, John was raised in 
Oakland and began his career as an engineer 
in the private sector and then worked at the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
While working at the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, John began working part- 
time as a realtor at California Realty. In 1972, 
John moved to Fremont to begin his own com-
pany, John A. Dutra Realty, which expanded 
to a large presence in Pleasanton with over 95 
agents. The company would later open offices 
in Castro Valley, Livermore, and Tracy, and 
became the Number One Real Estate Com-
pany in the East Bay. The company flourished 
as a real estate development and investment 
firm. 
During this same period, John was ap-
pointed to the Fremont Planning Commission, 
where he served four years, followed by the 
Fremont City Council, where he served ten 
years. He vigilantly oversaw the city’s fiscal 
status while pushing for new social services, 
including the construction of the city’s first 
homeless shelter and one of the city’s first af-
fordable housing projects. 
John was subsequently elected to the State 
Assembly, and during his six-year tenure was 
a member of numerous standing committees, 
including, Budget, Housing and Community 
Development, Judiciary, and Insurance. He 
also chaired the Transportation, Information 
Technology, and Veteran Affairs Committees. 
Among other accomplishments, he led the 
funding for the retrofitting of the east and west 
spans of the Bay Bridge and secured over 
$1,000,000 to retrofit the historic Mission 
Church in Mission San Jose. 
Beyond his impressive public service and 
private sector career, nothing was more impor-
tant to him than family. John is survived by his 
wife of 65 years, Bernadine F. Dutra; his chil-
dren, John, Cynthia, Anthony, Dominic, and 
Diana; his 13 grandchildren; and 9 great- 
grandchildren. He is also survived by his sister 
Bernadette. 
His dedication to his family and service to 
his community was always at the forefront of 
his mind and a trait that lives on in his family 
and every life he touched. John will be re-
membered by all those he impacted by his 
strength, brilliance, vision, and heart.

HONORING MICHAEL BITTEL FOR 
HIS 
DEDICATION 
TO 
SERVING 
THE NORTH COUNTRY BUSINESS 
COMMUNITY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Michael Bittel for his hard work 
and advocacy on behalf of the Adirondack 
business community. Since 2018, Mr. Bittel 
has led the Adirondack Regional Chamber of 
Commerce, the ARCC, as both the president 
and CEO, and now, after years of dedication, 
Mr. Bittel is retiring. 
Throughout his extensive career, Mr. Bittel 
has prioritized supporting local businesses and 
his community’s health and well-being. Prior to 
his current role at ARCC, Mr. Bittel served as 
COO at Hometown Healthcare and Co-CEO of 
the King Arthur Flour Company in Vermont. 
Mr. Bittel has served on the Boards for the 
March of Dimes New York, the Glens Falls 
Hospital, and the Northwest New York Salva-
tion Army. In his latest position as president of 
the ARCC, Mr. Bittel has often devoted ten-to- 
twelve hours each day to ensure smooth, con-
tinued operations of the Adirondack region’s 
small businesses. 
The 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
and 
its 
aftereffects have proven to be exceptionally 
difficult on small businesses and neighbor-
hoods across the country and throughout the 
Adirondacks, but Mr. Bittel presented himself 
as a strong leader in the face of difficulty. He 
worked to support struggling businesses in the 
height of the pandemic, advocated for proper 
funding for restaurants, and provided guidance 
for seasonal businesses in the midst of con-
fusing and trying times. Throughout each new 
obstacle over the past several years, Mr. Bittel 
stepped forward as a chief advocate for busi-
nesses in his region. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I am 
proud to celebrate the retirement of Michael 
Bittel. His dedication to public service and tire-
less support of small businesses in the Adiron-
dacks has been essential to the North Coun-
try’s ability to thrive during these unprece-
dented times. I wish him a happy and blessed 
retirement.

SWARTZ ON HIS OFFER OF AP-
POINTMENT 
TO 
ATTEND 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
AIR 
FORCE 
ACADEMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Aidan Swartz of Sylvania, Ohio, has been of-
fered an appointment to the United States Air 
Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo-
rado. 
Aidan’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Air Force Academy 
this fall with the incoming Class of 2026. At-
tending one of our Nation’s military academies 
offers the opportunity to serve our country and 
receive a world-class education. At the same 
time, these young men and women undertake 
one of the most challenging and rewarding ex-
periences of their lives. 
Aidan brings a tremendous amount of lead-
ership, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2026. While attending Northview High 
School in Sylvania, Ohio, Aidan participated in 
Leadership Academy and Football Leadership. 
Throughout high school, Aidan played football 
earning his varsity letter and becoming team 
captain. After high school, he attended the 
United States Air Force Academy Preparatory 
School in Colorado. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Aidan Swartz on his offer 
of appointment to the United States Air Force 
Academy. Our service academies offer the fin-
est military training and education available. I 
am positive that Aidan will excel during his ca-
reer at the Air Force Academy, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in extending their best 
wishes to him as he begins his service to our 
Nation.

HONORING MR. BONARD MACE 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize Mr. Bonard Mace, a distin-
guished Superintendent from my district who 
is retiring this year after a career of service. 
Mr. Bonard Mace is a dedicated educator of 
39 years, who served as a teacher, coach, 
and administrator in the Hoxie, Westside, 
Nettleton, and Gosnell school districts. He is 
retiring as the Superintendent of Gosnell after 
also serving as an Assistant Principal, High 
School 
Principal, 
and 
Assistant 
Super-
intendent. 
Mr. Mace devoted his careers to his stu-
dents and played an essential role in teaching 
and preparing the next generation to be lead-
ers and public servants. His hard work and 
dedication is invaluable in our communities, 
and I am certain the First District is better be-
cause of his service.

FL–16 LAW ENFORCEMENT

HON. VERN BUCHANAN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to law enforcement men

service to the people of Florida’s 16th Con-

Law enforcement is a demanding profession

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E575 
June 3, 2022 
Transmittal of Legislation Act, which would 
permit the Chairman of the Council of the Dis-
trict of Columbia to transmit legislation to Con-
gress in the form of the Chairman’s choosing, 
including in electronic form. This bill would 
modernize the method D.C. legislation is 
transmitted to Congress. I introduced a similar 
version of this bill earlier this year. 
The D.C. Home Rule Act (HRA) requires the 
Chairman to transmit legislation to Congress 
for a review period before the legislation may 
take effect. The legislation takes effect after a 
review period, unless a resolution of dis-
approval is enacted into law during the review 
period. While the HRA is silent on the method 
of transmittal, House and Senate precedent 
require that the legislation be physically trans-
mitted to Congress. Physical transmittal im-
poses costs in terms of time on the Council, 
the House and Senate Parliamentarians, the 
Speaker, the President of the Senate, the 
House clerk, the Senate Secretary, the House 
Committee on Oversight and Reform and the 
Senate Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. 
The Council engages in a 12-step process 
to comply with the physical transmittal require-
ment: 
Step 1: Write individualized cover letters. 
Step 2: The Chairman physically signs the 
cover letters. 
Step 3: Arrange a time to get the cover let-
ters from the Chairman. 
Step 4: Print two copies of the bill and two 
copies of the committee report to deliver to the 
Speaker and to the President of the Senate. 
Step 5: Arrange a time for delivery to the 
Speaker’s office. 
Step 6: Arrange a time for delivery to the 
President of the Senate’s office. 
Step 7: Arrange for two D.C. employees to 
drive to the Capitol. (Two staffers are required 
because parking restrictions require a driver 
and a delivery person.) 
Step 8: Drive to the Capitol. 
Step 9: Deliver the documents to the Speak-
er’s office and get a signed receipt. 
Step 10: Deliver the documents to the Presi-
dent of the Senate’s office and get a signed 
receipt. 
Step 11: Assign the congressional review 
period based on the receipts. 
Step 12: File the receipts. 
The aftermath of the January 6, 2021 attack 
on the Capitol highlighted the burdens of 
physical transmittal. After temporary fencing 
was installed around the Capitol, D.C. employ-
ees could not enter the Capitol, delaying 
transmittal until D.C. employees and congres-
sional staff developed a workaround. D.C. em-
ployees and congressional staff met outside 
the fencing so the D.C. employees could 
physically transmit the legislation. 
Today, when we live in the era of e-mail, 
there is no reason to continue to require an in-
creasingly ancient process, when these docu-
ments could be transmitted electronically in-
stead, saving a tremendous amount of time 
and effort. 
I urge my colleagues to support this com-
monsense bill. 
RECOGNIZING MICHIGAN’S CARIB-
BEAN 
AMERICAN 
HERITAGE 
MONTH 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Caribbean American Heritage 
Month to celebrate the contributions of Carib-
bean-Americans to Michigan’s 13th Congres-
sional District and all across our Nation. 
National 
Caribbean 
American 
Heritage 
Month was first recognized in 2005. This was 
the culmination of many years of efforts by or-
ganizations around the world to spotlight the 
numerous contributions to our Nation. Carib-
bean Community Services, a nonprofit organi-
zation based in Detroit, Michigan, has proudly 
uplifted that history. They routinely host nu-
merous events that celebrate the rich cultural 
heritage of the Caribbean and its impact on 
our communities in southeastern Michigan. I 
am incredibly proud of the important work Car-
ibbean Social Services undertakes to foster di-
verse and welcoming communities. I espe-
cially want to highlight their leadership in en-
suring these contributions are recognized and 
valued as we celebrate Caribbean American 
Heritage Month. 
Please join me in recognizing National Car-
ibbean American Heritage Month and the con-
tributions of Caribbean Americans across our 
Nation and the 13th Congressional District.

CONGRATULATING THE CRYSTAL 
RESTAURANT ON ITS DESIGNA-
TION AS A HISTORIC BUSINESS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 3, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate The Crystal Restaurant 
in Watertown on its rich history and its special 
designation as a historic business. The Crystal 
has been named to the New York State His-
toric Preservation Registry as they have been 
operating for over fifty years and contribute 
tremendously to the Watertown community. 
The Crystal Restaurant is Watertown’s old-
est restaurant, opening in 1925 under the 
ownership of brothers Dennis and Jerry 
Valanos. In 1928, The Crystal hired Otto 
Dephtereos as chef. Fifteen years later, Otto 
and his brother Nicholas, took over and pur-
chased The Crystal. After Otto’s son, Joseph, 
a radio gunner on a B–24 bomber during 
World War II, returned from England, he and 
his brother, Leo, took over The Crystal. Today, 
Peter Dephtereos, along with his wife and 
brother, manage the restaurant and maintain 
the beloved traditions of The Crystal. 
For many decades, the Dephtereos family 
has stewarded the oldest restaurant in Water-
town and preserved timeless traditions, like 
the ‘‘Tom and Jerry’’ cocktail. The Crystal re-
mains a thriving tribute to the history of Water-
town. It is home to one of the last stand-up 
bars in the country and even boasts a cash 
register that rang up President Franklin Roo-
sevelt’s bill in the 1930s. Few things have 
changed at the restaurant, and The Crystal 
prides itself on being a fixture in Watertown’s 
history. 
The Crystal is an incredible North Country 
establishment and has been an important 
asset to the Watertown community for over 
nine decades. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
District, I am proud to celebrate the rich his-
tory of The Crystal Restaurant and congratu-
late it on its designation as a historic business 
on the New York State Historic Preservation 
Registry.

standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Elizabeth Canfield of Bryan, Ohio, has been

Elizabeth brings a tremendous amount of 
leadership, service, and dedication to the in-
coming Class of 2026. While attending Bryan 
High School in Bryan, Ohio, Elizabeth partici-
pated in student government, show choir, and 
was a member of acapella choir. Throughout 
high school, Elizabeth was involved with cross 
country and swim and dive, earning a varsity 
letter in both. 
After graduating Bryan High School in 2018, 
Elizabeth enlisted in the United States Air 
Force and attended the Community College of 
the Air Force, majoring in Human Resource 
Management. She then went on to attend the 
United States Air Force Academy Preparatory 
School in Colorado. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Elizabeth Canfield on her 
offer of appointment to the United States Air 
Force Academy. Our service academies offer 
the finest military training and education avail-
able. I am positive that Elizabeth will excel

ing their best wishes to her as she continues

found in his sons and grandchildren. 
Pat was a dedicated servant of God, coun-
try, and state. My prayers will be with those
