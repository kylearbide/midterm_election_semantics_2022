PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Compassionate God, thank You for 
giving us another day. With each pass-
ing day, O Lord, we hear discouraging 
news of suffering and death during this 
pandemic, but hopeful news of possible 
treatments. In it all, we are under-
standably impatient to be past this 
current crisis and returned to lives 
which we will never again experience. 
Such is the profile of human history. 
Through our own history, Americans 
have relied upon Your faithfulness in 
their personal lives, and at times, in 
our national experience. 
Today, we stand before You, implor-
ing Your presence and assistance in our 
time of need. Give us the patience to 
trust in the work of medical research-
ers and professionals as they labor to 
conquer the coronavirus. Give them 
the wisdom and insight they need to 
bring to fruition their efforts to find a 
treatment and vaccine against this 
scourge. 
May everything done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

E407 
May 1, 2020 
IN RECOGNITION OF DR. ALEX 
AZAR 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Alex Azar, 80, of Salis-
bury, MD. He is remembered as a brilliant and 
devoted physician, passionate for his family 
and community. 
Born May 4, 1939, in Johnstown, PA Dr. 
Azar graduated from Westmont Hilltop High 
School in 1957. He attended University of 
Pittsburgh at Johnstown for three years before 
accepting early admission to Pitt’s Medical 
School where he graduated magna cum laude 
in 1964. He was a member of Alpha Omega 
Alpha, an Honor Medical Society membership 
I shared with him, as well as Phi Beta Kappa. 
After interning at Conemaugh Valley Memo-
rial Hospital, he served as a Captain in the US 
Army Medical Corps at Fort Bliss, TX from 
1965–1966. He eventually completed a pre-
ventive 
medicine 
and 
ophthalmology 
residencies at the Ohio State University. 
In 1976, Dr. Azar joined Dr. Robert Dickey 
in practicing ophthalmology in Salisbury. Over 
the course of 40 years, he founded both the 
Peninsula Eye Center and the Azar Eye Insti-
tute. He discovered several new and innova-
tive eye surgical techniques and ophthal-
mology care to several communities on the 
peninsula across southern MD and DE. 
He was noted for his devotion to his pa-
tients, never denying care because of a pa-
tient’s inability to pay. He often made house 
calls in the evening, even performing eye sur-
gery on a patient in a rocking chair on his 
porch on Smith Island. 
As part-time faculty of the Wilmer Eye Insti-
tute at Johns Hopkins University, he was 
voted most outstanding part-time professor in 
ophthalmology in 2011 and 2012. In 2015, he 
received the prestigious Arnall Patz Fellowship 
Award through the local Lions Club and the 
Wilmer Institute for his contributions to the 
field of ophthalmology. 
In 1996, Governor Schaeffer appointed Dr. 
Azar as the first and only physician member 
on the five member MD Health Care Access 
and Cost Containment Commission. He held 
various state and county medical society lead-
ership 
positions, 
including 
President 
of 
MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society. 
An active member of his community, Dr. 
Azar served on the Board of Directors of the 
local YMCA, the Board of the Three Lower 
Counties, the Center for a Healthy Maryland, 
the local Humane Society, as treasurer of the 
Camp Horizon Board of Directors, and as an 
officer of the Greater Salisbury Committee. He 
was also a 32nd degree Mason, a member of 
Wicomico Lodge #91, Tall Cedars of Lebanon, 
and the Scottish Rite. 
I am honored to acknowledge the legacy of 
a fellow caregiver and community servant. I 
join his family and community today in cele-
bration and memory of his lifetime of meaning-
ful contributions to humanity.

HONORING BENTON, ARKANSAS 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize the City of Benton, Arkan-
sas, for the healing and hope promised as 
part of their Wall of Prayer in the city’s down-
town. 
Benton Mayor Tom Farmer has constructed 
a lattice wall for residents to share their prayer 
requests on while preparing for the National 
Day of Prayer, May 7. 
This initiative reflects that many of Benton’s 
residents are looking for opportunities to main-
tain their sense of community during the cur-
rent public health crisis due to COVID–19 
while at the same time staying safe by fol-
lowing social distancing guidelines. 
Residents are encouraged to hang a prayer 
written on a piece of cloth on the wall, and 
each day at noon until May 7, faith leaders will 
pray over the wall uniting in the shared experi-
ence. 
While they are there, they can further show 
support for their community by taking a picture 
with the nearby ‘‘I Love Benton’’ sign. 
I congratulate Mayor Farmer and the City of 
Benton for this creative way to come together 
and pray for our community, and I look for-
ward to joining in prayer for this strong com-
munity on May 7.

RECOGNIZING 
SWEDISHAMERICAN 
HOSPITAL 
FOR 
SHARING 
PER-
SONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 
WITH THE ROCKFORD COMMU-
NITY 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor SwedishAmerican Hospital for its 
kindness and generosity in sharing personal 
protective equipment with at least 15 long- 
term care and rehabilitation facilities in Rock-
ford, Illinois. The hospital recognized a need in 
the community and decided to use their re-
sources to step up. 
SwedishAmerican Hospital has received nu-
merous donations in the past two weeks, al-
lowing it to share gloves, hair nets, masks, 
Lysol wipes and other items. When other fa-
cilities were running low on supplies and did 
not have the capacity to organize and accept 
donations themselves, SwedishAmerican Hos-
pital stepped in and helped ensure that sup-
plies were delivered. For more than a century, 
this hospital has been serving the Rockford 
community in many ways. The people working 
at SwedishAmerican Hospital are Hometown 
Heroes for all they do to serve patients and 
their community. 
It is because of community leaders such as 
SwedishAmerican Hospital that I am especially 
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to again 
formally recognize SwedishAmerican Hospital 
for identifying the need in the Rockford com-
munity and filling that need.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
government and public health officials in the 
U.S. have started grappling with how to re-
open the economy amidst the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Much of this discussion has under-
standably focused on what we need to do 
here in the U.S. such as drastically expanding 
testing capacity and hiring additional per-
sonnel to conduct a massive amount of con-
tact tracing. For us to be prepared to prevent 
outbreaks here at home, however, we also 
have to think beyond our borders. 
The reality of infectious diseases like 
COVID–19 is that outbreaks anywhere in the 
world threaten transmission here in the U.S. 
The pandemic has upended countries in al-
most every corner of the world, but the impact 
on developing countries will be especially dev-
astating. Not only do these countries already 
have low-resourced health systems but many 
are facing other challenges caused by conflict, 
climate change, droughts, migration and dis-
placement. Their ability to prevent, contain, 
and respond to outbreaks is severely limited, 
making assistance from the international com-
munity critical. 
While the prevalence of COVID–19 in most 
developing countries remains unknown due to 
limited testing, the impact of the crisis is al-
ready taking its toll. The economic fallout from 
the pandemic will hit vulnerable populations 
the hardest; hundreds of millions of people 
could be pushed into poverty. The United Na-
tions Food and Agricultural Organization has 
warned of a looming food crisis caused by sig-
nificant strains on the global food supply 
chain. By the end of this year, the number of 
people on the brink of starvation around the 
world could double. 
In the short-term, the U.S. must bring signifi-
cant investments in emergency economic and 
humanitarian relief to the table. The potential 
for drastic increases in poverty and wide-
spread famine will foster further instability and 
displacement. Progress in developing coun-
tries to reduce conflict, increase economic op-
portunity, and promote good governance will 
be set back. Providing immediate additional 
resources to combat COVID–19 in other coun-
tries will not only alleviate the humanitarian

crisis and reduce its potential destabilizing im-
pacts, but it will also help prevent new out-
breaks here in the U.S. 
In the long run, the work to prevent future 
outbreaks and combat the next pandemic is 
never-ending. The investments we make today 
in global health and development will help de-
termine our ability to prevent and combat fu-
ture outbreaks. For decades, unfortunately, 
this work has been underfunded. We have to 
increase our funding for global health security 
to strengthen health systems in developing 
countries so they are better prepared to con-
tain diseases and prevent outbreaks. Invest-
ments in development and economic assist-
ance, global health, and humanitarian relief 
are also vital for countries to improve their out-
break response and recovery. Efforts to cut 
these programs and gut key agencies such as 
USAID, the State Department, and the CDC 
are short-sighted and harm the long-term 
health and economic wellbeing of the U.S. 
In the coming months and years, a lot of at-
tention will be given to questions around how 
the COVID–19 pandemic unfolded and how 
we prevent and better mitigate future out-
breaks. We must use this opportunity to rein-
force the value of U.S. global leadership and 
make the case for strengthened investments 
in global health and development. If anything, 
the COVID–19 pandemic has been a stark re-
minder that these investments are critical to 
protecting the health, economic, and security 
interests of the U.S.

INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL 
(ICC) 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Building Safety Month and 
the men and women of the International Code 
Council (ICC) for their dedication to public 
safety. 
Building Safety Month is sponsored by the 
International Code Council and its partners to 
remind the public about the role our code offi-
cials’ play in ensuring safe, efficient, and liv-
able buildings. The theme this year is ‘‘Safer 
Buildings, Safer Communities, Safer World,’’ 
and encourages all of us to raise awareness 
of the importance of safe and resilient con-
struction, fire prevention, disaster mitigation, 
and new technologies in the construction in-
dustry. 
The International Code Council brings to-
gether local, state and federal officials to de-
velop an international standard to protect us in 
the buildings we live, work, and play in. Those 
standards are then implemented year-round 
by building safety officials, architects, engi-
neers, and laborers to ensure the safe con-
struction of buildings. 
Building and fire prevention departments are 
essential 
to 
the 
U.S. 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus pandemic by protecting the health 
and welfare of building occupants. They en-
force regulations requiring sanitation of hos-
pitals, plumbing systems, and adequate facili-
ties for handwashing. They inspect existing in-
frastructure, including plumbing, mechanical, 
ancillary, and fire safety systems to verify safe 
maintenance. 
With natural disasters increasing in fre-
quency and severity, building codes include 
important safeguards to protect the public from 
snowstorms, tornadoes, and earthquakes. In 
April of this year, the National Institute of 
Building Sciences (NIBS) found adopting mod-
ern building codes saves $11 for every $1 in-
vested. This means fewer casualties, property 
damage, business interruptions, and insurance 
costs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in thanking the International Code 
Council Board President and Chief Building 
Officer for Thornton, Colorado, Greg Wheeler, 
ICC’s Chief Executive Officer Dominic Sims, 
ICC’s members and staff, and ICC’s partners 
in the construction and design community 
across the country as we all recognize Build-
ing Safety Month.

HEROES IN THE WUHAN VIRUS 
PANDEMIC 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, in the midst of the National Emer-
gency being successfully faced by President 
Donald Trump and Vice President MIKE 
PENCE, there have been so many citizens 
stepping forward to help fellow neighbors in 
need. I am grateful to recognize heroes who 
are making a difference. 
Journalist Kara Gormley Meador has initi-
ated highlighting innovative citizens efforts to 
address the Wuhan Virus with former S.C. 
Revenue Director Burnie Maybank of the 
Nexsen-Pruet Law Firm, there is free stream-
ing at www.buzzpodcast.com. The first con-
versation was with President Lou Kennedy of 
Nephron Pharmaceutical where she explained 
retooling her operation almost overnight to re-
spond to the virus. She has been welcomed to 
the WVOC Radio in the Midlands with Gary 
David and Christopher Thompson. 
Dale Hatchell and Elizabeth Burt of Lex-
ington have organized Support a Nurse to pro-
vide ‘‘Light of Love’’ care kits to nurses on the 
front lines. These kits are donations of nutri-
tional and immunity products with a support 
message helping the Dorn Veterans Adminis-
tration Hospital, Lexington and Prisma hos-
pitals, and Department of Juvenile Justice. 
Talk radio host Kevin Cohen has been re-
lentlessly providing important updates for the 
Midlands of South Carolina, fulfilling his goals 
on The Point promoting charities and local 
events. 
Halsey Cook, Chief Executive Officer of 
Milliken & Company of Spartanburg is con-
tinuing the visionary tradition of the late Roger 
Milliken. Milliken & Company of Spartanburg is 
developing the manufacturing process for a 
new nanofiber with antiviral properties in co-
operation with retired Colonel David Lobb of 
Aiken and Ascend Materials of Florida. 
Scott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise In-
stitute in The Wall Street Journal (April 12) 
has thoughtfully presented a plan to reopen 
the economy for jobs with companies diag-
nosing coronavirus cases in the workplace. He 
understands healthy citizens need a healthy 
economy. 
Ambassador Andre Haspel of the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands has thoughtfully forwarded 
encouragement to members of the Congres-
sional Caucus of the Kingdom of the Nether-
lands. The alliance of the Netherlands and the 
United States is strong and appreciated to de-
feat the Wuhan Virus. 
General Milford Beagle, Commander of Fort 
Jackson, with Army Chief of Staff Major Gen-
eral James McConville have been pro-active 
to protect the lives of new recruits and the 
dedicated personnel at Fort Jackson. The in-
stallation trains nearly 50 percent of all Sol-
diers and more than 60 percent of all women 
entering the Army each year. 
Cecil Staton, President and CEO of the 
Asian American Hotel Owners of America, 
with Vice President Chirag Shah have worked 
tirelessly to promote the gruesomely impacted 
hospitality industry. AAHOA is the largest hotel 
owner’s association in the world with 20,000 
members owning half of hotels in America. 
Walgreens Drug Stores with the dedicated 
staff in West Columbia is appreciated for fea-
turing ‘‘Thanks to our frontline heroes.’’ On 
Saturday, first responders, law enforcement, 
doctors and nurses will receive 30 percent off 
Walgreens brands and 20 percent off other 
brands. Drug stores, grocery stores, conven-
ience stores and grocery stores, truckers, and 
other essential enterprises have been vital 
service for communities.

LESLIE 
WILLIAMS 
FOR SEEING A NEED IN THE MO-

OVER 1,200 MASKS FOR ANYONE 
WHO NEEDS ONE 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Leslie Williams for recognizing a 
need in Moline, Illinois for protective masks 
and making over 1,200 of them for police, fire-
fighters and all who need them. 
Leslie is currently out of work as a server 
and owner of a cleaning company; but is using 
her time to help others by creating masks dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. The masks are 
meant to go to first responders, front liners 
and all who need them. She says there is al-
ways something we can do to help others and 
that mentality is why she is a Hometown Hero. 
Leslie is using her forced time off to do good 
in the world and in her community. I commend 
Leslie for her efforts to help others and I wish 
her all the best in her future endeavors. 
It is because of leaders such as Leslie Wil-
liams that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally recog-
nize Leslie Williams for her generosity during 
the COVID–19 pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E409 
May 1, 2020 
coronavirus pandemic continues to have on 
the Town of Scotch Plains, New Jersey and 
many local governments throughout my district 
and the country. The coronavirus has deci-
mated local revenues and increased costs and 
only Congress can provide a lifeline to small 
towns through direct and flexible funding. 
Scotch Plains is a 9 square mile town of 
about 24,000 people. It has a medium-sized 
downtown of about 200 small businesses with 
an additional 100 businesses spread through-
out other commercial corridors of our town. 
The town is in the process of planning a revi-
talization of the downtown in conjunction with 
providing affordable housing. The town has a 
Aaa bond rating and the budget is lean. 
The coronavirus has hit Scotch Plains hard. 
As a result of the State’s stay at home order, 
just about all the small businesses are closed, 
and the businesses that remain open for take-
out/curbside pickup are barely surviving. Very 
few of the businesses received assistance 
from the first round of the CARES Act due to 
their small size and lack of credit history with 
banks. A Scotch Plains Business Resource 
Group comprised of volunteers and concerned 
citizens has been formed to assist the small 
businesses community navigate the various 
federal and state assistance programs. At-
tached is my four-point plan to assist those 
businesses that can remain open during the 
stay at home executive orders. 
Similarly, the town residents have been hit 
hard. Many of them have been furloughed 
from their jobs or forced to work at home at 
reduced hours. The closure of the schools has 
added additional difficulty for our residents to 
manage children as well as maintain employ-
ment. It is difficult to gage the percentage of 
residents who have been economically ad-
versely affected, but it appears to be substan-
tial. 
The township budget has been introduced 
on April 21, 2020 with a reduction in fore-
casted nonproperty tax revenue and a reduc-
tion in expense. However, the big unknown is 
the ability of our residents to continue to pay 
property taxes given the adverse effects of the 
corona virus on the economy. 
Under State law, the township must first 
fund the schools, counties and then the mu-
nicipality. For 2020, the township has an obli-
gation to fund the schools and the county at 
$69.5 million and $22.7 million, respectively. 
The municipal budget is $26 million. 
With a total obligation to raise $109 million 
in property taxes, a 5 percent loss in the col-
lection of these taxes would be almost $5.5 
million dollars with the responsibility of the mu-
nicipality to pay the county and school taxes 
first. Therefore, the municipal budget would 
have a 21 percent deficit leading to a signifi-
cant reduction of municipal services and mu-
nicipal staff. A 10 percent loss in property tax 
revenue would lead to an $11 million loss or 
a 42 percent reduction in municipal funds, se-
verely impacting the municipal government’s 
ability to deliver essential town services. 
Given the current economic situations, esti-
mates of 5 to 10 percent loss in property tax 
collection are probable. In addition, state aid 
of approximately $2 million is potentially being 
deferred from August to as late as December 
of 2020. 
The township’s ability to secure short term 
bonds to cover these types of potential rev-
enue shortfalls would be non-existent. Only 
the federal government has the capacity to 
help states and local governments of all sizes 
from falling off the above described budgetary 
cliff. Therefore, I strongly urge you to include 
in any future Coronavirus relief package my 
bill, H.R. 6467, which would provide $250 bil-
lion in stabilization funds to localities with pop-
ulations lower than 500,000.

RECOGNIZING KRISTA WYNES FOR 
CREATING HEARTS HUNTERS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Krista Wynes for her efforts with the 
group she created called Heart Hunters, which 
encourages parents and children to create 
hearts to display in their windows to encour-
age personal connection even while social 
distancing. The group was started on March 
21st and now has over 580,000 members 
worldwide. 
Ms. Wynes is married to Dave Wynes and 
is the mother of two children, Lincoln and Har-
rison, and lives in Galesburg, Illinois. She 
works as an ophthamalic technician in Peoria, 
and created the group on Facebook to reach 
out to neighbors while staying home and so-
cial distancing. Heart Hunters reminds people 
throughout different towns, states and nations 
that we are all in this together and none of us 
are alone. I commend Ms. Wynes on her work 
to bring people together in these rough times. 
She has shown kindness, resilience, and com-
munity building. 
It is because of leaders such as Ms. Wynes 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally recognize Krista 
Wynes for her work to bring people together 
through her Facebook group, Heart Hunters.

HONORING DR. PHILIP L. DUBOIS 
FOR HIS YEARS OF SERVICE AS 
CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVER-
SITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT 
CHARLOTTE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Dr. Philip L. Dubois for 20 years of 
service, including 15 years as Chancellor at 
the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 
As a proud 49er myself, I have seen his ex-
traordinary leadership firsthand and know how 
much he means to students, faculty and staff. 
When I was Student Body President, Dr. 
Dubois was a mentor and has since become 
a friend. He began his academic career in 
1976 at the University of California, Davis and 
retires after over two decades of combined 
service to UNC Charlotte. After being ap-
pointed Chancellor in 2005, he immediately 
began the important work that would one day 
transform both our institution and the sur-
rounding community. 
A titan among his peers in higher education, 
Dr. Dubois led UNC Charlotte through a time 
of unprecedented growth. He is credited with 
the construction of UNC Charlotte Center City, 
the Energy Production and Infrastructure Cen-
ter (EPIC), and industry collaborative POR-
TAL. Dr. Dubois’ efforts to build the Univer-
sity’s visibility and enrich the student experi-
ence led to the implementation of the football 
program in 2013 and a historic partnership 
with the City of Charlotte to bring light rail to 
campus. 
Exemplary of Dr. Dubois’ commitment to 
academic excellence, he spearheaded initia-
tives that saw the University make significant 
strides in endowment, research awards, enroll-
ment, and graduation rates. In the past 15 
years, UNC Charlotte awarded over 92,000 
degrees and offered 36 new academic pro-
grams to students across the globe. 
The greatest test to Dr. Dubois’ leadership 
came on what he described as our Univer-
sity’s ‘‘darkest day.’’ On April 30, 2019, two 
students were killed and four others wounded 
in a shooting in a classroom on campus. Dr. 
Dubois’ courage, strength, and his humanity 
led a brokenhearted student body, faculty, and 
community through the pain and the grief. 
Renee and I would like to extend our most 
heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Dubois for his 
years of exemplary service at UNC Charlotte. 
I know I speak for all of Niner Nation in wish-
ing he and his wife Lisa continued success 
and happiness as they move on to their next 
great adventure. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Dr. Philip L. Dubois upon his retire-
ment as Chancellor of the University of North 
Carolina at Charlotte.

TRIBUTE TO REV. DR. WILLIAM P. 
DIGGS 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a great man of faith and 
a true community servant. Rev. Dr. William P. 
Diggs, Sr. Dr. Diggs transitioned in Florence, 
South Carolina on April 25, 2020. Although he 
is no longer with us in person, his legacy lives 
on through his tremendous work. 
William Diggs, Sr. was born in Columbia, 
South Carolina and grew up in Rock Hill. He 
earned his bachelor’s degree from Morehouse 
College and a Master’s from Atlanta Univer-
sity. He found his calling in the ministry and 
earned a Master of Divinity from Colgate- 
Rochester Divinity School and a Doctor of 
Ministry from McCormick Theological Semi-
nary in Chicago. 
He began his career in his hometown of 
Rock Hill, where he served as an Assistant 
Professor of Sociology at Friendship Junior 
College. While there, he helped students orga-
nize a sit-in that launched the Jail No Bail 
movement in 1960. 
In 1962, Rev. Dr. Diggs joined Trinity Bap-
tist Church in Florence, South Carolina, where 
he served as head pastor for 50 years before 
retiring in 2012. He left his imprint on the 
church through several initiatives. Under his 
supervision, the church parsonage was com-
pleted in 1964, the church property was ex-
panded, and many additions and improve-
ments were made to the complex over his ten-
ure. He also added a fully accredited pre-
school and chartered a federal credit union.

Beyond the church’s physical plant, Rev. Dr. 
Diggs also oversaw the purchase of commer-
cial property that provide business opportuni-
ties in the community like barber and beauty 
shops and a restaurant. 
During his time as a faith leader, he also 
served in many secular capacities. He taught 
at Benedict College in Columbia and Morris 
College in Sumter. Rev. Dr. Diggs also served 
as President of the Florence Branch of the 
NAACP and was a poweeful voice for social 
justice. He was a calming presence during the 
1975 riots that erupted in Florence after a po-
lice officer shot a black man during a traffic 
stop. 
Rev. Dr. Diggs served as a board member 
of Friendship, Benedict and Morris colleges, 
Morehouse School of Religion, the Inter-
denominational Theological Center, Nannie 
Helen Burroughs School, the Greater Florence 
Habitat for Humanity, and the Florence May-
or’s Human Relations Committee. 
He was awarded the state’s highest civilian 
honor, the Order of the Palmetto. In addition, 
he was named to the South Carolina Black 
Hall of Fame and was recognized in the South 
Carolina African American History Calendar. 
Rev. Dr. Diggs was married to the former, 
Clotilda Daniels, and the couple has two adult 
children, William, Jr. and Mary Lynn, who 
managed my campaign for South Carolina 
Secretary of State. They have one grandson, 
William, III. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the life and 
legacy of Rev. Dr. William P. Diggs, Sr. I con-
sidered him both a political and religious men-
tor, who taught us all ‘‘to do justly, be merciful 
and walk humbly’’ as instructed in Micah 6:8. 
He will be sorely missed.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, on the For-
eign Affairs Committee, we know that so many 
critical national security threats require a glob-
al, coordinated response. We know that we’re 
stronger when we work with our international 
partners to face challenges head-on. And we 
know that the United States has a vital global 
leadership role to during international crises. 
Today, those principles should guide our re-
sponse to this pandemic. The rapid spread of 
COVID–19–—an infectious disease that knows 
no borders—has presented us with unprece-
dented challenge and heartbreak. We need a 
path forward for the United States and coun-
tries around the world to get on the road to-
ward rebuilding and recovery. 
More than 50,000 Americans have died 
from coronavirus. It’s painfully clear that the 
Administration should have done more to pre-
pare for this pandemic and protect our citi-
zens. There is so much more we have to do 
to keep Americans safe and our communities 
healthy moving forward. We need more test-
ing. We need to support our doctors and 
nurses. We need to help those who provide 
our food and those who keep us safe. But, we 
simply can’t do those things effectively if we 
bury our heads in the sand and wall ourselves 
off from the rest of the world. 
Our world is interconnected. Fighting the 
coronavirus for America means making sure 
other countries can effectively fight the pan-
demic, as well. The United Nations Secretary 
General Antonio Guterres summed it up well: 
‘‘We are only as strong as the weakest health 
system in our interconnected world.’’ 
That’s why the Trump Administration’s deci-
sion to cut funding for the World Health Orga-
nization is so counterproductive. The WHO 
plays a vital role in supporting and enforcing 
international health regulations, educating the 
public, and strengthening the ability of health 
systems—particularly those in the developing 
world—to prevent, detect, and respond to out-
breaks. This is precisely the time that we need 
the WHO most. Instead, the Administration is 
stopping all our funding—just like shutting 
down the fire department in the middle of a 
blaze. 
Retreating from global health institutions at 
this time only makes it harder for us to combat 
COVID–19, putting our national security and 
American lives at risk. When America pulls 
away from the world, others will fill the void. 
China is already providing relief and support to 
countries now on the brink of their own cri-
ses—particularly in Africa and the developing 
world. And, Beijing pledged an additional $30 
million to the WHO just as Trump suspended 
American funds to the world body. The United 
States must act to preserve the critical devel-
opment gains we helped drive, from basic 
education to access to clean water to free and 
fair elections. 
lf we want to see the world recover in a way 
that strengthens our economy, national secu-
rity, and environment—in a way that promotes 
and preserves the values of freedom and de-
mocracy which we hold dear—in a way that 
raises up impoverished people—we need to 
lead it in that direction. Now is the time for 
American global leadership. Now is the time to 
recognize our interconnected world and work 
with our partners to save lives in countries 
near and far. Now is the time to move forward 
for America and the world.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF NANCY 
ANN KINCADE WILLIAMS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Nancy Ann 
Kincade Williams, who passed away on April 
26th at the age of 78. 
Nancy Ann, born in 1941, grew up in the 
Mississippi Delta and graduated from Clarks-
dale High School in 1959. After high school, 
she spent one year at the Mississippi Univer-
sity for Women before transferring to the Uni-
versity of Mississippi. After graduating from 
the University of Mississippi she began work-
ing as a teacher until she received her ulti-
mate calling of being a loving and dedicated 
mother to her four children. 
As a member of the First United Methodist 
Church, Nancy Ann was very active teaching 
bible study and serving as a youth leader. She 
was also a very active member of her commu-
nity volunteering in the Fin de Siecle Club, 
Garden Club, and Junior Auxiliary. Nancy 
Ann’s life of service and giving back to others 
also included serving as a homeroom mother, 
a scout leader, and a swim team coach. 
Left to cherish her memory is her husband 
of 57 years, Kenneth Weaver Williams, her 
four children, her brother, and 15 grand-
children, as well as many friends and family 
members. Nancy Ann’s life was one of serv-
ice, grace, love for her family, and community.

Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Jakobs Brothers Farms for its efforts 
in combating hunger in our district during our 
state and nation’s time of need. This family 
farm is encouraging other farms to donate 
grains to local grain bins in exchange for do-
nations to local food pantries. 
Organized by Jakobs Brothers Farms, grain 
donations from area farmers are being con-
verted into supplies for local food pantries to 
help others during the coronavirus pandemic. 
At bins and elevators throughout Northern Illi-
nois, Rock River Lumber and Grain, F/S 
Grain, and Gold Star F/S are taking grain do-
nations, and in return donating the cost to 
local food pantries. I commend Jakobs Broth-
ers Farms for creating this way to help those 
most in need, and I am proud of all of the 
work they are doing. I appreciate all they are 
doing to help local communities. 
It is because of leaders such as Jakobs 
Brothers Farms that I am especially proud to

RECOGNIZING MALLORY PREDDY 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize Mallory Preddy, an em-
ployee at the Boston Mountain Rural Health 
Center in Clinton, AR, for her extraordinary 
work during this public health crisis. 
Mallory usually serves as a dental hygienist 
at the clinic, but when the public health crisis 
began, she volunteered to learn how to screen 
patients at the front door of the clinic. 
She later began screening patients for pos-
sible need of COVID–19 testing and is now 
serving as a runner, transporting samples from 
the testing tent to the lab for packaging. 
Her supervisor wrote the following. ‘‘[Mal-
lory] has readily volunteered for anything that 
we needed her to do. Some people just stand 
out in times of crisis and Mallory has been 
one of those people.’’ 
Mallory has stepped up to the plate for our 
nation during this time, taking on duties out-
side of her job description and putting herself 
in harm’s way to help the people in her com-
munity. 
I thank Mallory for her dedication to pro-
tecting the health of Arkansans during this 
time. She, and Frontline workers like her, are 
vital to us overcoming COVID–19 as a nation.

RECOGNIZING THE FISCAL IMPACT 
OF 
THE 
CORONAVIRUS 
PAN-
DEMIC ON THE TOWN OF PHIL-
LIPSBURG, NEW JERSEY 
HON. TOM MALINOWSKI 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the devastating impact the 
coronavirus pandemic continues to have on 
the Town of Phillipsburg, New Jersey and 
many local governments throughout my district 
and the country. The coronavirus has deci-
mated local revenues and increased costs and 
only Congress can provide a lifeline to small 
towns through direct and flexible funding. 
I learned recently from the joint press re-
lease from our office, that Warren County has 
been left out of the $82,202,575 in Federal 
funding awarded to the State of New Jersey 
from the stimulus package passed by both the 
Congress and the Senate to help states fight 
the Coronavirus Pandemic. We were one of 
only four NJ counties to have received no 
funds. 
I have received numerous calls from resi-
dents over the last few weeks as to why we 
did not receive any funding, and as the Mayor 
of Phillipsburg, I have no answers. This fed-
eral aid is to help all communities and evi-
dently Warren County was not included. This 
Pandemic did not pick and choose, and nei-
ther should the government on who should re-
ceive funding. Everyone should be helped in 
this time of need. 
Phillipsburg is a small rural community in 
Warren County, New Jersey and just like 
every other community across our great State 
we are all facing the same challenges due to 
this outbreak. Every city, town or borough is 
dealing with the crisis in their own way be-
cause no two communities are the same how-
ever we are all facing the same obstacles that 
need to be overcome. This crisis will not only 
affect what is happening in 2020 but also will 
affect the Town’s ability to budget in future 
years especially in 2021. We believe that next 
year’s budget may be more adversely affected 
than the 2020 budget. Most if not all revenue 
collections will be down and must be adjusted 
and accounted for. The revenues that Town’s 
collected in 2019 cannot be guaranteed to col-
lect the same amount in 2020 thus creating a 
shortfall and unfortunately those shortfalls will 
carry over to the 2021 budget. 
To compensate for the decreased revenues 
Towns must for other ways to make up for lost 
revenue such as using more from surplus if 
they have the ability or probably more likely 
and most unfortunately look to reduce services 
or staff. Laying off an employee who works 
and lives in the municipality is one of the hard-
est decisions any City or Town must make. Al-
though 
we 
hope 
the 
layoffs 
won’t 
be 
permeant, in looking to future budgets no one 
can guarantee that it won’t be. Cutting serv-
ices such as not opening a municipal pool, 
golf courses or campgrounds, canceling rec-
reational activities such as summer sports or 
day camps and canceling Town celebrations, 
concerts, festivals, fairs and carnivals can lead 
to a sense of depression that is felt all over 
Town. 
For many of our residents this may be the 
only entertainment or activities they get each 
summer and in a moment in time where we 
must look to raise our resident’s spirits, we 
seem only to be offering disappointing and 
heartbreaking news. Again, the lost revenues 
from these activities are crushing to a munic-
ipal budget who count on these activities. Al-
though we all hope these are temporary 
cancelations, done with the best interest of our 
residents in mind to keep them safe, it would 
be nice if we didn’t have to do it at all. The 
federal government is under a lot of pressure 
right now to try to help an entire nation, we 
just ask that the local governments who are 
also under the same amount of pressure can-
not be and must not be left out and forgotten. 
The stimulus money the federal government 
can offer will go a long way to ensure the local 
governments can still meet all the needs of 
our community.

Wrestling Tournament in the 120 pound 
weight class. 
Phoenix is 37–7 and now a state champion. 
He previously competed in three straight Illi-
nois Kids Wrestling Federation title matches 
where he placed second, but he was deter-
mined to win first at the high school state tour-
nament. As a former athlete, I appreciate the 
fortitude Phoenix displayed to achieve his 
dream of being a state champion and com-
mend him for his efforts and attitude. Phoenix 
is an example of the importance of dedication 
and a strong work ethic, and I am proud to 
see him represent Dakota so well throughout 
the state with his talent and passion. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
Phoenix Blakely that I am especially proud to 
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
congratulate Phoenix Blakely on his Class 1A 
State Finals title in Wrestling.

HONORING BIRTH-DAY 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I invite my 
colleagues to join me and members of Con-
cerned Families in Southern Oregon in recog-
nizing ‘‘Birth-Day’’ on the first day of every 
May. Since 2012, the Birth-Day Project has 
motivated concerned adults to make an impact 
on their local public and private schools by 
visiting students and celebrating all their birth-
days with ice cream sundaes and recreational 
activities. Nearly 10,000 Americans celebrated 
Birth-Day last year, including several of the in-
augural members in Grants Pass, OR who 
first recognized Birth-Day as 4th graders nine 
years ago. In fact, the Birth-Day Project has 
been so significant for students and their com-
munities that a similar group in the State of 
New York, Young Life Manhattan, now cele-
brates Birth-Day in schools throughout the 
Bronx. 
However, this May students that would be 
wrapping up their school year or graduating at 
school, are instead learning from home and 
practicing social distancing in the wake of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Although many students 
and adults may feel disheartened at missing 
this year’s Birth-Day celebration while at 
school, I ask that they keep in mind the senti-
ment of honoring the birth and life of their fel-
low community members. As the Coronavirus 
continues to impact our daily lives, we must 
turn to our American values to reinvigorate our 
fortitude as well as own faith in each other 
during this crisis. The Birth-Day Project seeks 
to bring out the best in us by valuing compas-
sion, community, and service to others. 
Once again, l hope my colleagues will join 
me today, Friday, May 1st in building commu-
nity connectedness all over our great country 
and celebrating the birthdays of young Ameri-
cans who deserve some cheer and support 
during these trying times. I would personally 
like to wish a happy Birth-Day to all the Or-
egon students who cannot celebrate at school 
this year. We are all in this together.

HONORING THE IOWA NATIONAL 
GUARD AS IOWANS OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me, 
in honor of National Military Appreciation 
Month, in recognizing the nearly one thousand 
members of Iowa’s National Guard that are 
helping our state fight COVID–19 as our 
Iowans of the Week. 
Over 800 soldiers and airmen with Iowa’s 
National Guard have been called to state ac-
tive duty to help combat COVID–19. They’re 
delivering personal protective equipment to 
our Frontline health workers and county emer-
gency management facilities. They’re helping 
our food banks package and deliver food to 
Iowans in need. And they’re helping our state 
complete COVID–19 testing through the new 
‘‘Test Iowa’’ program, a critical step to charting 
a pathway to safely reopening Iowa through a 
data-driven understanding of the spread of the 
virus in Iowa. 
Members of the Guard like Specialist Janet 
Fonseca and Private First Class Cesar 
Galvan—a 
husband 
and 
wife 
from 
Marshalltown—have stepped up and helped 
their fellow Iowans in the face of these un-
precedented times. Our Iowa National Guard 
are citizen soldiers—meaning they have to 
balance everyday demands with their respon-
sibilities of service to our nation. Even soon- 
to-be and new parents, like Guardsman Mark 
Williams, are balancing the needs of their fam-
ilies and the demands of serving during this 
pandemic. 
In the past few weeks, members of our Na-
tional Guard have worked early mornings and 
long days, helping to deliver personal protec-
tive equipment to over 88 counties in Iowa to 
keep our health care workers and emergency 
response professionals safe. 
They’ve also helped to repackage and sort 
food at our food banks—ensuring Iowans in 
need during this pandemic do not go hungry. 
I’m proud to represent Camp Dodge, the 
headquarters of the Iowa National Guard, in 
Johnston, Iowa. I’m proud of the strong serv-
ant leadership I’ve seen in Colonel John Per-
kins, serving with the Army Guard, and Briga-
dier General Shawn Ford, serving with the Air 
Guard. These brave men and women who are 
now called to serve are taking time away from 
their regular jobs and their families to help 
support our citizens—and they deserve the 
thanks of a grateful state. 
Our National Guard members now serving 
may be known to their neighbors only as 
members of the local church or an employee 
at a local business—their regular lives before 
this pandemic that gave no indication of their 
commitment to serve. But in times of crisis, we 
know we can count on them—for this is hardly 
the first time they’ve been called to help. 
Last year, when Iowa was reeling from dev-
astating flooding in the southwest part of our 
state, it was members of our National Guard 
who stepped up to help crippled communities 
get back on their feet. 
And so, in recognition of National Military 
Appreciation Month, I’m proud to honor the 
brave and dedicated men and women of the 
Iowa National Guard for their critical help to 
our emergency response to the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
I ask everyone to join me in thanking the 
Iowans serving our country both here and 
around the world as members of the United 
States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, 
and Coast Guard. Their commitment to our 
nation and to protecting our citizens—in the 
face of enemies both seen and unseen—is not 
forgotten in these unique and challenging 
times.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CORNELIUS LEVI KNOWLES 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I

Cornelius Levi Knowles; 
Whereas, ‘‘Corky,’’ as he was affectionally 
known to his friends and family, was born in 
Hallandale, Florida to Melbourne and Albertha 
Knowles on January 20, 1928, and graduated 
from Dorsey High School with bold aspirations 
in 1946; 
Whereas, after working hard and saving 
money, Cornelius moved to Washington D.C. 
to attend Howard University, overcoming racial 
prejudices, working nightly at the post office, 
and obtaining his undergraduate degree, he 
graduated from the Howard University College 
of Dentistry second in his class; 
Whereas, Cornelius had a distinguished ca-
reer—serving as a clinical instructor at Howard 
University before moving to Chicago to open 
his own practice and serving as an examiner 
for both the Northeast Regional Board of Den-
tistry and the Illinois State Board of Dentistry; 
Whereas, outside of his distinguished ca-
reer, Cornelius was a loving husband to Al-
thea, the love of his life. Together they were 
active community members supporting count-
less charities and treating everyone they met 
like family for nearly 60 years; 
Whereas, Cornelius will be remembered by 
friends as the life of the party, always having

IN MEMORY OF JAMES WOOD 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of James Wood. Well- 
known in North Texas, he was businessman, 
veteran, and philanthropist. 
Mr. Wood was born on November 4, 1937, 
in Decatur, Texas and grew up the youngest 
of five children. After graduating high school in 
1956, he left his Wise County hometown and 
went to work in a shipyard on the Harvey 
Canal in Louisiana. After a short time working 
in Louisiana, he entered the U.S. Army, serv-
ing his country for three years. Upon his hon-
orable discharge from the military, Mr. Wood 
went to work at Bell Helicopter in Fort Worth. 
He decided to try his hand at selling cars 
just like his father. Mr. Wood became man-
ager of Cocanougher Ford in Bridgeport. For 
a decade, with his wife Shirley, they success-
fully operated Tanwood Motor Sales in Deca-
tur before taking over the General Motors 
dealership. 
In 1989, under the leadership of Mr. and 
Mrs. Woods, James Wood Motors became the 
largest GMC truck dealer in the United States. 
During the next decade, their dealership was 
the top GMC dealership in Texas. James 
Wood Motors built a new facility in 1989 and 
became Wise County’s full-line General Mo-
tors. 
The Woods expanded their geographic foot-
print and vehicle offerings by purchasing a 
Buick/GMC dealership in Denton. James 
Wood Motors added Pontiac, Chevrolet, Olds-
mobile, Jeep, Eagle and Mazda to their deal-
ership portfolio and created the James Wood 
AutoPark by 1994 in Denton. The Woods fam-
ily currently owns General Motors dealerships 
in Decatur and Denton, a Hyundai dealership 
in Decatur, as well as Neighborhood Used Car 
dealerships with multiple North Texas loca-
tions. 
Mr. Wood was recognized for his many con-
tributions to the community as Decatur’s ‘‘Cit-
izen of the Year’’ in 1989. In addition, he was 
elected to the GM Presidents Dealer Advisory 
Council in 1987 and served as a board mem-
ber of the Wise Health System for ten years. 
He was instrumental in founding the Cham-
pions and Blue Ribbon Club for the Wise 
County Youth Fair and due to his time and ef-
forts in support of the Fort Worth Stock Show, 
he was elected to the Stock Show Board of 
Directors. 
While a very successful business owner and 
community philanthropist, Mr. Wood was also 
an avid farmer and rancher and dedicated 
family man. He enjoyed cutting horses and 
raising cattle but most importantly, spending 
time with his wife of sixty years, Shirley, and 
their three children: daughter Janetta, son 
Raymond and late son Josh, grandchildren 
and great grandchildren. 
James Wood was a respected business and 
community leader and a beloved husband, fa-
ther, grandfather and great grandfather. He 
will be sorely missed by his family and friends 
to whom I extend my sincere condolences.

ABIGAIL TROESTLER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO

Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Abigail 
Troestler for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Abigail Troestler is a student at Arvada 
West High School and received this award be-
cause her determination and hard work have 
allowed her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Abigail 
Troestler is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Abi-
gail Troestler for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF HAR-
OLD REID, A FOUNDING MEMBER 
OF THE STATLER BROTHERS 
HON. BEN CLINE 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize the passing of Harold Reid on April 24, 
2020, and to honor his legacy of commitment 
to family, community, and music. 
Harold Reid was born August 21, 1939, the 
son of Sidney Boxley Reid and Mary France 
Craun. He married Brenda Lee Armstrong and 
together they raised daughters Kim, Karmen, 
Kodi, Kasey, and son Wil. He is survived by 
Brenda, their children and spouses, and ten 
grandchildren. 
Harold Reid loved his family, entertaining, 
and the small-town they call ‘‘home’’—Staun-
ton, Virginia. Together with high school 
friends, Harold formed the Four Star Quartet, 
debuting as gospel singers, who were wel-
comed in churches across the Staunton, 
Waynesboro, and Augusta County area. They 
performed for high school dances and other 
local events before winning the 1955 Kiwanis 
Amateur Talent Show in Staunton, earning a 
live performance on a Richmond television 
station. 
By 1960, the group’s membership changed, 
and Don Reid joined his brother in the group 
which became known as The Kingsmen. They 
played for the Miss Virginia Pageant and 
earned a contract to appear regularly on a re-
gional television station. In 1962, they opted to 
change their performing name again, becom-
ing The Statler Brothers. 
Histories of the renowned Statler Brothers 
credit Harold Reid with the vision and cha-
risma that encouraged the quartet to continue 
their musical performances. His deep bass 
voice undergirded wonderful harmonies when 
the quartet was on stage. His sense of humor 
kept audiences engaged and his fellow 
bandmates upbeat through long hours of road 
travel. 
It was Harold Reid who approached another 
country music legend, Johnny Cash, following 
Cash’s performance in Roanoke, Virginia. Har-
old reportedly told Johnny that he should hear 
the quartet sing. A few days later, the Statler 
Brothers opened for Johnny Cash for shows in 
Berryville, Virginia. The Statler Brothers be-
came a part of Cash’s roadshow on March 1, 
1964. Fans of country music will recall where 
that road led. 
The Statler Brothers earned their first hit the 
following year with ‘‘Flowers on the Wall.’’ The 
group released more than 50 albums. They 
won three Grammys, nine Country Music As-
sociation Awards, six International Country 
Music Awards, and numerous Music City 
News Awards. The Statler Brothers Show ran 
on The Nashville Network from 1991 to 1998. 
‘‘Flowers on the Wall’’ garnered renewed inter-
est when the lyrics were included in the movie 
‘‘Pulp Fiction’’ (1994). In 1996, a Harris Poll 
ranking America’s favorite singers listed the 
group as second to Frank Sinatra and ahead 
of many other singers across various genres. 
The Statler Brothers have been inducted into 
the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (2007) and the 
Country Music Hall of Fame (2008). The group 
performed for over 40 years. 
Harold Reid and the Statler Brothers never 
forgot their small-town roots. Harold was a co-

founder of Happy Birthday USA. Annually for 
25 years, the Statler Brothers would invite 
country music friends to join them onstage in 
Staunton’s Gypsy Hill Park to celebrate the 
Fourth of July with family and neighbors. The 
events drew thousands of people to celebrate 
America’s Independence and picnic while lis-
tening to country music artists and the on- 
stage banter of Harold Reid. 
The Statler Brothers, whose members at the 
time included Harold and Don Reid, Phil 
Balsley, and Jimmy Fortune, retired from per-
forming in 2002. Members wanted to return 
home to spend time with family. In retirement, 
it was not unusual to see Harold along with 
Brenda and their family at various events 
around town. 
Young men from small-town America who 
enjoyed singing, the Statler Brothers became 
world famous, bringing laughter and tears to 
their fans over the long course of their musical 
career. Retired, the Statler Brothers continued 
to encourage young performers and to cele-
brate America and small-town community life. 
Wilson Fairchild, the country duo of Wil Reid 
and Langston Reid, have stepped onto the 
musical stage and picked up the mantle of 
celebrating the Fourth of July in Staunton’s 
Gypsy Hill Park by hosting Happy Birthday 
America. 
Harold Reid created a lasting impression on 
all those who met him, on the fans that he en-
tertained over four decades, on country music 
as a songwriter, and on the community where 
he remained rooted. It is with appreciation for 
a life well-lived that these words about Harold 
Reid’s achievements are submitted for the 
RECORD. May his family and friends find sol-
ace in knowing the esteem with which we up-
hold the memory of Harold Reid.

RECOGNIZING THE FISCAL IMPACT 
OF 
THE 
CORONAVIRUS 
PAN-
DEMIC 
ON 
THE 
TOWN 
OF 
BERKELY HEIGHTS, NEW JERSEY 
HON. TOM MALINOWSKI 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the devastating impact the 
coronavirus pandemic continues to have on 
the Town of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey 
and many local governments throughout my 
district and the country. The corona virus has 
decimated local revenues and increased costs 
and only Congress can provide a lifeline to 
small towns through direct and flexible fund-
ing. 
With a population of just under 13,500, the 
Township of Berkeley Heights in Union Coun-
ty, New Jersey has been hard hit by the 
Covid–19 pandemic. We have witnessed 129 
cases to date with 21 deaths and residents 
testing positive every day, adding to our over-
all caseload. 
Our local budget is set to be introduced be-
fore the state’s extended deadline of April 28th 
while our second tax collection period begins 
May 1st. The timeframe does not allow our 
governing body to make an informed decision 
of tax collection versus expenditures. As a re-
sult, we significantly cut our spending to pro-
vide a zero dollar increase to our residents 
since the outbreak of the pandemic. Layoffs of 
part-time employees and cutting police radios, 
police cars, fire department gear and sewer 
department equipment and has been sac-
rificed this year amidst the financial crisis that 
our state, county and township faces as we 
follow Governor Murphy’s Stay-at-Home order. 
As we remain at home to spare the lives of 
our family, friends and neighbors, our local 
budget faces shortfalls from: the closure of our 
municipal court and resulting halt in fees it 
generates; hotel occupancy tax revenue— 
which generally produces $250,000 in revenue 
directly to the municipality not shared with the 
Board of Education or County; Uniform Fire 
Prevention inspection decline due to social 
distancing rules; Little interest being earned on 
investment as a result of the Federal Reserve 
lowering interest rates to 0 percent; Antici-
pated lower-than-usual collection of current 
year taxes as a result of economic hardships 
experienced by our residents such as employ-
ment or loss of their small businesses; Can-
cellation of Spring and likely Summer recre-
ation programs, halting fees into our Recre-
ation Trust Fund, which pays for our recre-
ation employees. 
Further, we also anticipate an increase in 
tax appeals from businesses for 2020. The 
Township already received notice of appeal 
from its two biggest taxpayers—Connell Office 
park and Nokia/Bell Labs—and anticipates 
that many small businesses will follow. Addi-
tionally, as a result of our Judgment of 
Repose, the Township is obligated to move 
forward with 6 redevelopment projects that 
have PILOT agreements attached to pay for a 
$32,000,000 municipal complex to house our 
police, senior, library, recreation and adminis-
tration space. The facilities will be essential for 
our residents as we move through this pan-
demic into our new ‘‘normal.’’ Delays in rede-
velopment construction due to supply chain 
disruptions related to Covid–19 will likely im-
pact future construction fees, which means an-
ticipated revenue to the Township from these 
projects will not be realized sooner, when it is 
so desperately needed. Finally, we anticipate 
the State of New Jersey and County of Union 
will also face great fiscal challenges and 
therefore, the Township expects a decrease in 
grant money available for infrastructure repair 
such as roads and our sewer infrastructure, 
which has not been upgraded since con-
structed. 
Additionally, New Jersey municipalities have 
a legal obligation to pay the Board of Edu-
cation and the county, even if our portion of 
taxes cannot be collected. This places a tre-
mendous burden on small towns. 
It is crucial that smaller municipalities re-
ceive CARES 2 funds to help stabilize our 
local government and economies. I implore 
the United States House and Senate to pass 
legislation that will help small-town America.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
CHRISTOPHER SCOTT SANDEFER 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Christopher 
Scott Sandefer, who passed away on April 
25th at the age of 57. Scott grew up in Lee 
County, Mississippi, and was a standout ath-
lete at Shannon High School where he grad-
uated in 1980. He then attended the University 
of Mississippi where he was a member of the 
ROTC and graduated with a degree in Public 
Administration. 
Scott answered the call to serve our great 
nation with the Mississippi National Guard and 
was a Brigade Leader and Company Com-
mander for the 155th Brigade in Tupelo for 
many years. Scott’s life of service also in-
cluded over 30 years in law enforcement at 
many agencies and positions. Scott served as 
a former Captain of the North Mississippi Nar-
cotics Unit, he served with the Tupelo Police 
Department, the Pontotoc Police Department, 
and later retired from the Pontotoc County 
Sheriffs Department where his talents were 
appreciated and respected by all. 
Scott enjoyed spending time in the outdoors 
where he was an avid hunter and motorcyclist. 
He was also an avid college sports fan and 
especially enjoyed cheering on his alma mater 
the Ole Miss Rebels. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Cristi 
Lane Jordan Sandefer, his daughter, Shelby 
Leigh Sandefer, as well as many other close 
family members and friends. Scott Sandefer’s 
life was one of service, grace, love for his 
family, and community. He will be greatly 
missed by all whom he encountered.

students in my district. You may ask, why is 
a Congressman from Arizona recognizing a 
group from Utah? Well, it just speaks to its 
generosity and the great impact this organiza-
tion is having in my district. 
This great organization is providing art sup-
plies for 85 sixth-grade students in the com-
munities of Beaver Dam and Colorado City, 
Arizona. These communities are located in the 
geographically isolated Arizona Strip, which is 
north of the Grand Canyon, near the Utah bor-
der. For context, to travel to almost any other 
part of Arizona takes hours because you can-
not drive over the Grand Canyon, Madam 
Speaker. 
The intent of this program is to stimulate 
creativity in these young people and give them 
activities to keep their minds active once the 
school day is over. Each student is provided 
with items such as coloring books, markers, 
and colored pencils and are given creative li-
cense to create whatever they like. 
In addition to the art program, the Assist-
ance League also organizes an annual cam-
paign called Operation School Bell. This pro-
gram provides clothing to disadvantaged stu-
dents and this year will include a literacy pro-
gram to greater enrich the minds of these stu-
dents. 
I would sincerely like to thank the Assist-
ance League’s President Gail Neumann and 
Vice President Kay Minor for being willing to 
serve their neighboring state and their im-
measurable impact on the Beaver Dam and 
Colorado City communities.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD, at the request of a Virginia 
Beach constituent, Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman, 
of Temple Lev Tikvah and is a reflection of his 
views: 
‘‘At the heart of the Passover Seder is the 
haunting probing of ‘Ma Nishtana . . . How 
different is this night from all other nights?’ 
This historical Rabbinic quest is designed to 
grasp Passover’s meaning throughout the 
generational chain in the context of chang-
ing and always challenging times. It is tradi-
tionally sung by the youngest attending 
child, to mitigate the seriousness of the in-
quiry surrounding the complex poles of en-
slavement and freedom in the Jewish con-
sciousness as well as human experience. 
Surely at this beclouded Passover Festival, 
the plague of the Coronavirus is casting omi-
nous darkness not only on one people as with 
the punitive Ten Plagues upon Pharaoh’s 
Egypt for freedom’s sake and slavery’s de-
nouncement. Pharaoh was forewarned time 
and again to let Moses’ people go. Now we 
face a global attack by a stealthy adversary 
exposing the entire interdependent human 
family to the Angel of Death’s whims. All 
that in the midst of a complacent post-mod-
ern high technology society. We are tempted 
by the hubris of false invincibility, plunging 
us to a debilitating sense of primeval vulner-
ability, threatening our accustomed and en-
viable American way of life and its under-
lying essential democracy. 
Ultimately the Passover celebration is a 
poignant reminder that enslavement in its 
destructive variety—physically, spiritually 
and psychologically—is bound to be over-
come by the light of deliverance, replacing 
virus with virtue, pain with promise and vio-
lence with vision. 
At this season’s Seder table, those who are 
fortunate to safely conduct it, should dimin-
ish from the cup of joyful salvation in addi-
tion to the ten drops for the ten plagues 
upon ancient Egypt for the sin of Hebrew en-
slavement, one drop for the current heavy 
human loses and intense suffering. The in-
spiring Exodus journey from servitude to an 
oppressor to service of The Most High, be-
came a model of liberation for the human 
family, culminating in the Messianic vision 
of a world transformed. 
We have chosen to convert the bitter herbs 
of our exile into the sweet charoset of home-
coming for all. It is the symbolic hovering 
presence at the Seder table of the prophet 
Elijah for whom we open the door and set 
aside a special cup of wine, which provides 
for the eternal flame of universal shalom’s 
healing, hope and harmony. It is the peace 
we have kept alive as a flickering light in 
history’s darkness. 
Passover’s promise by a compassionate 
heritage is ultimately rooted in its revolu-
tionary view of the infinite worth of each of 
the Creator’s children, recalling that God si-
lenced the heavenly angels when jubilant at 
the drowning of Pharaoh’s troops. Passover’s 
soaring spirit of renewal of a people as well 
as an individual, also applies to the natural 
order of springtime’s reassuring return with 
the beauty of the Earth’s budding and recov-
ery that we are pledged to forever secure.’’

NAMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Bryan Caves, a junior from River-
dale High School, who won the Illinois High 
School Association’s Class 1A State Finals 
Wrestling Tournament in the 220 pound 
weight class. 
Bryan was the aggressor and rode on top 
for most of the six-minute match. After coming 
in underweight, he had to rely on his condi-
tioning and training to win the match. In the 
end, Bryan won the state title by a 4–2 deci-
sion. As a former athlete, I appreciate the for-
titude Bryan displayed to achieve his dream of 
being a state champion and commend him for 
his efforts and attitude. Bryan is an example of 
the importance of dedication and a strong 
work ethic, and I am proud to see him rep-
resent Port Byron so well throughout the state 
with his talent and passion. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
Bryan Caves that I am especially proud to 
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
congratulate Bryan Caves on his Class 1A 
State Finals title in Wrestling. 
IN HONOR OF DR. JOE ALLEN 
MANN 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bid farewell to my dear friend, Dr. Joe 
Allen Mann who passed away on February 
21st. Joe demonstrated what it meant to be an 
American, through his actions and his words. 
He galvanized many Republican fellows in the 
Commonwealth and reminded them that they 
had a voice too. He valued both his family and 
community, and for that I rise to honor his life 
and achievements. 
Joe was born in the tiny, bustling city of 
Ronceverte, West Virginia in 1941. He later 
graduated from West Virginia University, and 
later obtained his doctorate in chemistry from 
Georgia Tech. As a scientist, Dr. Mann began 
his career at Dow Badische, working his way 
from an entry-level employee to a manager in 
just a few years. Joe then advanced to Cor-
porate Director for Research and Development 
for Burlington Industries, where he met his 
wife, Carol Mann. Joe’s ambition, however, 
compelled him to start a business, beginning 
with The Mann Group, then earned enough 
capital to start Mann Industries in Williams-
burg, VA. 
Joe had a knack for resilience and per-
severed through the ebbs and flows of his life. 
After years in his industry, Joe decided to get 
involved in politics where he knew he could do 
the greatest amount of good. He was a mem-
ber of the Colonial Republican Men’s Associa-
tion 
where 
he 
championed 
conservative 
thought and revitalized the conservative com-
munity. Also, he served as a trustee at the 
Leadership Historic Triangle, where he could 
directly impact his community. Joe is survived 
by his wife, Carol, and two daughters, Mary 
and Susan. I offer my prayers and condo-
lences that his family overcomes their grief 
and celebrates the great life that Joe lived. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask you to 
join me in honoring the life of Joe Mann and 
applauding his contributions to the Common-
wealth and our Nation. His sacrifices, hard-
ships, and devotion to others are worthy of 
reverence. On behalf of America’s First Dis-
trict, we say thank you.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Central Arkansas Vet-
erans Healthcare System (Central Arkansas 
VA) nurse Teresa West for recently being 
awarded the VA Secretary’s Award for Excel-
lence in Nursing. 
The VA Secretary’s Award for Excellence in 
Nursing program was established in 1984 and 
is given only once to an individual. 
Teresa is the nurse manager for the VISN 
16 Clinical Resource Hub, which combines in- 
person care and telehealth to support under-
served medical facilities. 
Her work is crucial in allowing rural veterans 
to get the care they need, when they need it, 
regardless of location.

HONORING THE WAUKEE FIRE DE-
PARTMENT AS IOWANS OF THE 
WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing the men and women of the 
Waukee Fire Department in Waukee, Iowa as 
this week’s Iowans of the Week. 
The firefighters and paramedics of the 
Waukee Fire Department are an integral part 
of the Waukee community, and their dedica-
tion to protecting the health and safety of 
those they serve is nothing short of exem-
plary. That dedication is just as evident in the 
Waukee Fire Department’s community en-
gagement efforts. They’re a frequent face vis-
iting local schools, leading fire station tours, 
and hosting engaging, educational children’s 
birthday parties at the fire station. I am grate-
ful that our children have these hardworking 
men and women to look up to as role models. 
Right now, Iowa’s police, fire, and emer-
gency services personnel are continuing to 
provide essential services in their communities 
as Iowans stay home during the coronavirus 
outbreak. I know that this adjustment can 
make folks feel apart from their neighbors, es-
pecially 
in 
close-knit 
communities 
like 
Waukee. 
But that’s not stopping the Waukee Fire De-
partment. Thanks to the creativity and imagi-
nation of Lieutenant Tony Clemen, the depart-
ment is finding a new way to get out in the 
community. They’re bringing the birthday 
party—the fire truck, lights and all—to the chil-
dren; they even play ‘‘Happy Birthday’’ over 
the truck’s loudspeaker. Needless to say, the 
idea’s been a hit with kids and parents alike. 
And now the community is joining in. On 
one recent visit, the Waukee Fire Department 
met up with locals before making a birthday 
visit. Together, they formed a birthday proces-
sion over twenty cars long, honking and wav-
ing to neighborhood kids along the way. I’m so 
glad that Iowans are coming together to 
spread much-needed joy and smiles as we 
work to slow the spread of coronavirus to-
gether. 
Our firefighters across Iowa are responding 
to emergency calls across our great state. I 
know many of our firefighters don’t have the 
protective equipment they need, like face 
masks, to protect themselves during this 
COVID–19 outbreak. As our firefighters work 
to protect our communities, I will work to pro-
tect our firefighters and ensure they can get 
the essential equipment, protecting, training, 
and assistance they need. 
The men and women of the Waukee Fire 
Department are truly making a difference in 
their community, especially during these chal-
lenging times. I could not be more thankful for 
their hard work and service, and I ask the 
House to join me in recognizing them as 
Iowans of the Week.

RECOGNIZING THE FISCAL IMPACT 
OF 
THE 
CORONAVIRUS 
PAN-
DEMIC ON THE TOWN OF CLIN-
TON, NEW JERSEY 
HON. TOM MALINOWSKI 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the devastating impact the 
coronavirus pandemic continues to have on 
the Town of Clinton, New Jersey and many 
local governments throughout my district and 
the country. The coronavirus has decimated 
local revenues and increased costs and only 
Congress can provide a lifeline to small towns 
through direct and flexible funding. 
As a mayor of a small town in NJ I am not 
only worried about my current year’s revenue 
loss but also the implication of that lost rev-
enue on my 2021 budget. We cannot antici-
pate in a future year more revenue that we ac-
tually brought in. What we do anticipate is 
probably a 15–20 percent reduction in mis-
cellaneous revenue (which is approximately 
one quarter of my total revenue)—this would 
include our court fees, permitting, Energy Tax 
Receipts, hotel/motel occupancy fees as well 
as UCC fees. What does this mean? Services 
may have to be cut back or eliminated that 
residents count on, we would not furlough em-
ployees because this is not a savings for a 
small town like ours—we are a ‘‘pay as you 
go’’ unemployment. Any employees we lay off 
we would still be responsible for the two-thirds 
of the salary. 
What communities like Clinton need to have 
is the ability to replace the lost revenue in the 
line items so that we do not see a longer term 
impact with future budget years. 
I know that I am not alone in my concerns 
and other mayors are struggling to manage— 
we work with slim margins and any reduction 
creates havoc with municipal budgets and 
tough decisions that impact our residents.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF CARY 
CHARLES CHILDS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Cary 
Charles Childs, who passed away on April 
18th at the age of 54. Throughout his life, 
Cary had a deep passion for the cattle and 
farming industry and he was the owner and 
operator of Childs Angus and Hereford and 
AgriServices. 
He was involved with state and national 4– 
H Livestock Programs where he inspired 
countless youth over many years. Cary also 
served as the President of the Tippah County 
Fair Association for nearly 20 years, he served 
on the Mississippi Angus Association Board 
for over two-decades, and he also served on 
the Mississippi Hereford Association Board for 
many years. Cary had a passion for Mis-
sissippi State Athletics; however his greatest 
passion was for his family. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Mary 
Childs, his parents: Charles and Gara; his 
brother: Roger; his son Bob Glover; and his 
grandchildren: Snow, Graham, and Pierce 
Glover as well as many other close family 
members and friends. Cary Childs life was 
one of service, grace, love for his family, and 
community. He will be greatly missed by all 
whom he encountered.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, at the outset, 
I thank my colleagues, Chairman AMI BERA 
and Ranking Member TED YOHO, for their crit-
ical work on this pressing issue. 
American leadership is fundamental to the 
peace and security of the international order. 
It’s the conduit through which the world can 
partake in the fruits of international coopera-
tion and is particularly critical to the cause of 
global health—a cause in which America has 
always led from the front. 
From 2018 through 2019, the United States 
provided 
the 
World 
Health 
Organization 
(WHO) with over $890 million, with $656 mil-
lion coming in the form of voluntary contribu-
tions. Since launching PEPFAR in 2003, the 
United States has devoted more than $90 bil-
lion towards mitigating the effects of the HIV 
epidemic. In Fiscal Year 2019, the U.S. dedi-
cated approximately $11 billion towards global 
health initiatives. We’re the best financer and 
promoter of international health efforts in the 
world—from government agencies to non-gov-
ernmental organizations, our People give hope 
to billions. Progress in international health, 
however, will remain somewhat stunted unless 
we accept a brutal truth: despite America’s 
best efforts, the constant and malicious false 
narratives peddled by the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) are the world’s greatest impedi-
ment to international cooperation and better 
health results. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has once again 
demonstrated that the CCP is not worthy or 
capable of our trust—a fact we’ve known for 
decades. Since 1949, China has lied to the 
world and regularly placed the supremacy of 
the state above any other consideration. Fol-
lowing the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, 
the CCP portrayed the pro-Democracy pro-
tests as a Western plot to discredit China; by 
crushing these peaceful protests, the govern-
ment claims it was able to pave the way for 
a prosperous 21st Century. Official death esti-
mates from the protests vary widely; China 
has never offered reliable data on this sub-
ject—but it remains likely that several thou-
sands of young students and their allies were 
killed following a brutal military crackdown. 
In 2000, the CCP immediately labeled Falun 
Gong—a Chinese spiritual movement—as a 
‘‘heretical cult,’’ and had many ofthe group’s 
followers imprisoned. A 2019 report conducted 
by the China Tribunal—a panel created by the 
International Coalition to End Transplant

Abuse in China (ET AC)—indicates that ‘‘pris-
oners of conscience,’’ especially Falun Gong 
practitioners, were usually targeted for organ 
harvesting. In 2006, a tour guide told visiting 
European Parliament Vice President, Edward 
McMillan-Scott, that he’d seen the cadaver of 
his friend—a Falun Gong practitioner—with 
numerous stiches across his body. That tour 
guide received five years in prison for speak-
ing with Mr. McMillan-Scott. To this day, the 
Chinese government denies harvesting the or-
gans of Falun Gong practitioners, yet reports 
indicate that the number of Falun Gong practi-
tioners who are victims of organ harvesting is 
in, at least, the thousands, if not the hundreds 
of thousands. 
The way the Chinese treated, and continue 
to treat the Falun Gong runs contrary to stand-
ards laid out by the WHO; incredibly, the 
WHO refuses to acknowledge the reality of 
China’s organ harvesting campaign. 
According to the Council on Foreign Rela-
tions, between 800,000 and 2,000,000 Uighurs 
and ethnic Kazaks have been imprisoned in 
Chinese ‘‘re-education camps’’ since April 
2017. In these camps, the CCP has condoned 
the practice of forced abortions and steriliza-
tion procedures on imprisoned women. Many 
cases of sexual abuse emanate from these in-
stitutions as well. Prisoners are placed under 
constant surveillance and have been forced to 
renounce their religious and political convic-
tions. 
In 2003, the People’s Republic of China 
waited three months before notifying its own 
people, as well as the World Health Organiza-
tion, about the SARS outbreak. This pattern of 
late notice was repeated again last year, when 
the CCP hid knowledge of a new coronavirus. 
By December 31, both the WHO and Chinese 
authorities were alerted by Taiwanese officials 
that this virus could be spread by human-to- 
human transmission; but Beijing didn’t tell its 
own citizens anything until January 20. In the 
interim, China began a wholesale purge of any 
whistleblowers; arresting Dr. Li Wenliang and 
eight other doctors. Earlier this month, Dr. Ai 
Fei, the Director of Emergency Services at 
Wuhan Central Hospital and a former col-
league to Dr. Li, disappeared. Untold numbers 
of doctors, reporters, lawyers, and other civil 
activists have been reported missing for 
defying the government’s draconian restric-
tions on information sharing. 
Silencing whistleblowers and ignoring Tai-
wan weren’t the only sins the Communist 
Party of China committed during the pan-
demic. On December 31, the CCP began cen-
soring social media, and launched a campaign 
to find those who’d criticized the government’s 
response to the virus. Shortly afterwards, both 
the Hubei Provincial Health Commission and 
the National Health Commission ordered gene 
sequencing companies and institutions to de-
stroy testing samples; all in the hopes of pre-
venting the spread of new information regard-
ing the virus. On January 5, the Wuhan Mu-
nicipal Health Commissions stopped issuing 
daily updates about the virus for almost two 
weeks; on January 6, the CCP declined a U.S. 
CDC offer of assistance. From January 8–9, 
CCP health officials stated that there was no 
evidence of human-to-human transmission of 
the virus; and it also finally announced the 
COVID–19 outbreak in public. 
On January 12, the CCP provided the WHO 
with the virus’ genomic information. On Janu-
ary 14, the WHO stated that there was no evi-
dence to suggest that the virus could be 
spread by human-to-human transmission. This 
raises many flags—given the fact that the 
WHO had access to the virus’ genomic infor-
mation, and it’s troubling that an international 
institution would so quickly provide this kind of 
sweeping statement without a thorough anal-
ysis of the data. 
Given the fact that the threat of COVID–19 
was significantly downplayed by CCP’s health 
authorities, nearly 5 million people were able 
to leave Wuhan, China before the government 
imposed a quarantine on January 21. On Jan-
uary 22, the WHO stated that, while there was 
evidence of human-to-human transmission, 
more work was needed to determine the ex-
tent of the transmission. The very next day, 
WHO Director, General Tedros, voted against 
declaring the outbreak of the SARs–CoV–2 
virus as a Public Health Emergency of Inter-
national Concern, justifying his vote by saying 
there was no evidence of human-to-human 
transmission outside of China. 
On January 27, the Mayor of Wuhan admit-
ted that strict regulations imposed by the Bei-
jing government prevented him from saying 
much about the new virus. On January 29, the 
WHO 
praised 
China’s 
reaction 
to 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, while also declaring a 
Public Health Emergency of International Con-
cern the very next day. President Trump wise-
ly closed off U.S. travel to Chinese visitors on 
January 31. 
Well over a month passed before China al-
lowed a restricted visit to the WHO; yet that 
institution continued to parrot the CCP line. 
Numerous other infractions colored China’s re-
sponse fo the coronavirus—from threatening 
criminal charges against those using social 
media 
to 
spread 
information 
regarding 
COVID–19, to blaming the United States Army 
for the outbreak. 
This Congress should demand that China 
be held accountable for its gross negligence 
and cover-up during the current crisis. My 
hope is that everything we’ve discussed today 
demonstrates that this is more than just a one- 
off botching; lies and obfuscation form an es-
sential part of the Chinese government meth-
odology. China has given us every reason to 
believe that it’ll never be a good faith partner, 
and so our future efforts must include taking 
targeted actions to mitigate its influence. 
Many actions need to be taken; the first of 
which has already been done. I applaud Presi-
dent Trump and his Administration for commit-
ting to withhold all future funding to the WHO 
until extensive organizational change is made. 
The mind-boggling irresponsibility of the WHO 
during this pandemic just proves that it’s pow-
erfully influenced and irreparably compromised 
by the machinations of the CCP. The second 
step is for the U.S. to strongly advocate for 
the inclusion of Taiwan in the WHO. Our Na-
tion has withstood some of the greatest chal-
lenges in human history, and we’ll rise to this 
one. Time is of the essence, though. The CCP 
is presently the greatest enemy to both global 
health and the United States, and our policies 
must reflect that. 
Despite this sobering reality, we dare to 
hope for a better future for ourselves and for 
the Chinese people—the first victims of their 
government’s oppressive regime. With full ac-
knowledgement of the imposing task in front of 
us, we’ll once again demonstrate to the world 
why the cause of freedom and peace is in 
good hands.

Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise

the Town of Dover, New Jersey and many 
local governments throughout my district and 
the country. The coronavirus has decimated 
local revenues and increased costs and only

Due to COVID–19 the Town of Dover has 
been forced to take unprecedented measures 
to educate the community on the virus and 
CDC guidelines to ensure the residents under-
stand and practice social distancing and other 
protocols. These measures have forced the 
Town to have a higher number of expenses 
that were not included in the budget, there-
fore, the Town has to suspend a number of 
services and activities for the residents. Fur-
thermore, the number of unemployed resi-
dents has increased which has created a very 
high demand for basic essentials like food, 
personal hygiene items, baby food and dia-
pers. The Town was forced to suspend all 
parking enforcement, permits, and sports ac-
tivities which all have negatively impacted rev-
enues. The Town was not able to hire addi-
tional firemen during this very difficult time, 
which puts the existing personnel at higher 
risk. We desperately need financial support to 
help ensure that our community is able to 
bounce back from this health and economic 
pandemic.

Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Nolan Throne, a senior from 
Rockridge High School, who won the Illinois 
High School Association’s Class 1A State 
Finals Wrestling Tournament in the 145 pound 
weight class. 
Nolan was in a scoreless bout until the third 
period, where he took down his opponent and 
secured a victory. As a former athlete, I appre-
ciate the fortitude Nolan displayed to achieve 
his dream of being a state champion and com-
mend him for his efforts and attitude. Nolan is 
an example of the importance of dedication 
and a strong work ethic, and I am proud to 
see him represent Taylor Ridge so well

THE 72ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
STATE OF ISRAEL 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, l rise 
today to include in the RECORD a statement 
from Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman, founder and 
spiritual leader of Temple Lev Tikvah in Vir-
ginia Beach, and the representative of the 
Jewish Community at the City of Chesa-
peake’s civic occasions. 
As the State of Israel celebrates its 72nd 
anniversary in its eighth decade, we miss the 
prophetic voice and heroic presence of Amos 
Oz (1939–2018), one of Israel’s premier authors 
whose books were translated into forty-four 
languages. His life mirrored the history of 
the reborn Jewish state out of the monu-
mental Holocaust that consumed a third of 
the Jewish people. He was the very embodi-
ment of an inspiring Israel and its acknowl-
edged representative to the world, with for-
eign leaders seeking his perspective on 
events involving Israel. He fought in both 
the 1967 and 1973 wars. 
Oz was honored with significant inter-
national literary awards, though the Nobel 
Prize somehow eluded him while being a pe-
rennial nominee. He served as Professor of 
Hebrew Literature at Ben-Gurion University 
in Be’er-Sheva though he was courted by Je-
rusalem’s Hebrew University from which he 
graduated. Oz was a great humanist and a 
distinguished member of the Israel Move-
ment for Reform and Progressive Judaism. 
He was born in Jerusalem during the British 
Mandate to Fania and Dr. Arye Klausner, a 
gifted linguist of sixteen languages. They 
immigrated to then-Palestine from Eastern 
Europe. Oz’s great-uncle was Professor Yosef 
Klausner, the Hebrew University’s renowned 
scholar of the Second Temple period. 
Following Fania’s suicide at age thirty- 
eight, Oz opted at age fifteen to leave his Je-
rusalem home by himself and move to Kib-
butz Hulda where he changed his surname 
Klausner to the Hebrew Oz which connotes 
courage. It befitted the kibbutz’s pioneering 
Labor ideology and its break with the Euro-
pean experience to which his parents were 
attached, particularly its culture. It was a 
turning point for Oz who was raised on Zeev 
Jabotinsky’s Revisionist ideology of mani-
fest Jewish power. He consequently began 
identifying with the ‘‘new Jew’’ finding ful-
fillment in returning to till the ancient 
homeland, in contrast to the perceived Dias-
pora Jew represented in his own family. 
There is an intriguing early religious chap-
ter in the author’s life attending an Ortho-
dox elementary school while his family was 
secular and even anti-religious. He was ex-
posed to working class students who re-
garded him as an outsider, a rejection he 
later experienced in the kibbutz. His second- 
grade teacher, who deeply impacted him, was 
the famous poetess Zelda, whom Oz described 
as his first love. 
In his book, A Tale of Love and Darkness, 
Oz recalled the dramatic vote at the United 
Nations on November 29, 1947 to partition 
Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, which 
the Arabs refused to accept. His father, Arye, 
was moved to tears lying next to him in bed 
telling Amos that he would never be exposed 
to anti-Semitic attacks the way he and 
Grandpa Alexander were in Poland with 
their pants forcibly removed by hooligan 
students at his high school. Oz witnessed the 
unforgettable night of the critical vote with 
his neighborhood gathering to listen to the 
one available radio. His family’s small apart-
ment was home to about twenty people dur-
ing the 1948 War in Jerusalem, all enduring 
hardship with some losing dear ones. 
Oz, an iconic Israeli figure, was a peace ac-
tivist and a ardent supporter of a two-state 
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
regarding it as vital to Israel’s best interests 
politically as well as ethically, no less than 
‘‘a matter of life and death for the State of 
Israel’’ that must retain a Jewish and demo-
cratic identity. He feared for Israel’s future 
internally as well as externally, regarding 
Judaism’s genius in its Biblical prophets’ hu-
manistic ideals and moral sensitivity to-
wards society’s weak and disenfranchised. Oz 
advocated the curbing of the establishment’s 
raw power ‘‘to cause pain.’’ He was gravely 
concerned for the growing conflict between 
those advocating for strict Orthodox Jewish 
law (Halacha) and the great majority opting 
to preserve democracy. 
He lauded secular Israel’s significant and 
multiple accomplishments in revitalizing the 
Hebrew language and culture, establishing a 
flourishing modern Jewish state recognized 
as the world’s start-up nation with such 
humble beginnings and acute security con-
cerns. Oz’s sharp arrows were aimed not only 
at the political Right but also at Israel’s So-
cialist founders for failing to acknowledge 
the full tapestry of the Jewish heritage, with 
patronizing treatment of the Mizrachi and 
Sephardic Jews who had a moderate ap-
proach toward religion and diversity. He be-
moaned the worldwide rise of dangerous fa-
naticism of Islamic fundamentalism, anti- 
Semitism, Islamophobia, white supremacy, 
racism, and xenophobia. 
Amos Oz, the secular prophet of pain and 
promise, doom and deliverance, concludes 
his last book, Dear Zealots, with whom he 
sought dialogue, on a stirring message of 
both searing pessimism and consoling opti-
mism, ‘‘I am extremely fearful for the future 
. . . But I like being Israeli. I like being a 
citizen of a country where there are eight 
and a half million prime ministers, eight and 
a half million prophets, eight and a half mil-
lion messiahs. Each of us has our own per-
sonal formula for redemption, or at least for 
a solution . . . What I have seen here in my 
lifetime is far less, yet also far more, than 
what my parents and their parents ever 
dreamed of.’’ 
Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman is founder and 
spiritual leader of Temple Lev Tikvah (Heart 
of Hope) in Virginia Beach. It meets at The 
Church of the Holy Apostles, the only 
world’s community of both Episcopalians 
and Roman Catholic. He was born in Chu, 
Kazakhstan (USSR) in 1945 to Polish Holo-
caust survivors. He and his family lived 
among Jewish refugees in Poland, Austria 
and Germany, prior to moving to Israel in 
1949. He is a member of the Virginia Beach 
Human Rights Commission.

HONORING LIEUTENANT CAMERON 
MCCORD 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and congratulate Lieutenant 
Cameron McCord for his faithful service to our 
country as an esteemed member of the 
Navy’s Office of Legislative Affairs in the U.S. 
House of Representatives. In this capacity, 
Lieutenant McCord facilitated interaction be-
tween the Department of the Navy and Mem-
bers of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
These engagements included, but were not 
limited to, formal responses to congressional 
inquiries, counsel to Members and staff, and 
execution of congressional and staff delega-
tions. These interactions were pivotal in pro-
viding Members and staff a greater under-
standing of the issues facing our Navy and its 
sailors. 
I am particularly proud to note that Lieuten-
ant McCord planned and executed CODEL 
Panetta to the U.S. Africa Command area of 
responsibility to examine aspects of U.S. Spe-
cial Operations Force and partner nation oper-
ations in North and West Africa. He coordi-
nated and facilitated movement across six 
countries and three continents for seven indi-
viduals. I am forever grateful for his leader-
ship, persistence, and support of CODEL Pa-
netta. 
Lieutenant McCord’s distinguished career 
began after commissioning in the U.S. Navy 
from the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology. His first assignment was in Charles-
ton, SC, where he entered the Nuclear Power 
School and Nuclear Power Training Unit. After 
completing 
the 
Submarine 
Officer 
Basic 
Course in Groton, CT, McCord reported to the 
USS Helena (SSN 725) in 2015, where he 
served as the Chemistry and Radiological 
Controls Assistant, Information Technology Of-
ficer, Antiterrorism Officer, and the Assistant 
Weapons Officer. McCord stood both Junior 
Officer of the Deck and Officer of the Deck on 
a dynamic EUCOM deployment from 2016 to 
2017, completing multiple missions vital to na-
tional security. 
McCord 
holds 
a 
Navy 
Commendation 
Medal, two Navy Achievement Medals, and 
has served on a team onboard USS Helena 
that has earned two Navy ‘‘E’’ Ribbons, 
amongst other personal and unit awards. 
Madam Speaker, I commend and thank 
Lieutenant Cameron McCord on his service to

HONORING 
LONG-TERM 
AND 
SKILLED NURSING EMPLOYEES 
AS IOWANS OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, our elder 
Americans are among the highest risk for 
COVID–19. During this outbreak, our seniors 
need the continued support from their commu-
nities. 
That is why I rise today to ask the House of 
Representatives to join me in recognizing the 
dedicated employees of lowa’s 444 long-term 
and skilled nursing facilities as they face new 
and unforeseen challenges in providing care 
for their patients and residents. 
Social distancing is not an option for these 
health care workers. Every day, these essen-
tial workers show up at work, receive their 
screenings at the door, and suit up in their 
protective equipment—often homemade—so 
they can continue to serve and provide the 
same level of care for their residents—our par-
ents, grandparents, our family, friends, and 
beloved community leaders. They show up de-
spite the lack of personal protective equipment 
and show great ingenuity as they find new 
ways to protect their patients and themselves. 
Daily, they are working to protect our most 
vulnerable Iowans. 
Employees at skilled nursing facilities have 
very difficult jobs. They carry the responsibility 
of caring for our loved ones as they face the 
uncertain challenges of aging. They bathe, 
dress, feed, engage—and love—their resi-
dents to keep them happy and healthy. Ad-
ministrators and their assistants balance tight 
budgets and shuffle schedules to accommo-
date severe staffing shortages. Chefs and 
cooks create menus with quality meals to ac-
commodate many dietary restrictions and daily 
needs to ensure our seniors are leading 
healthy lives. All these difficult tasks are only 
compounded by the stress of added protective 
measures and coping with the anxieties that 
come as a result of the crisis we now find our-
selves in. 
I am grateful for the strength and resiliency 
that our workers in long-term and skilled nurs-
ing facilities have shown during this crisis. 
While we are not able to visit our loved ones 
in these facilities, we can rest assured they 
are continuing to receive quality attention and 
care during this time. So today, I’m asking my 
colleagues here in the House to join me in 
honoring the remarkable employees who are 
keeping our long-term and skilled nursing fa-
cilities in Iowa up and running in the face of 
unprecedented challenges. 
RECOGNIZING ARYAN ARORA FOR 
HIS WIN IN IMPROMPTU SPEAK-
ING AT THE IHSA INDIVIDUAL 
EVENTS STATE TOURNAMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 1, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Aryan Arora for his win in Im-
promptu Speaking at the IHSA Individual 
Events State Tournament. Aryan is the sev-
enth state speech champion from Rockford 
Public Schools and the first since 1963. 
Aryan is a senior at Auburn High School in 
Rockford, Illinois. Students at the state tour-
nament had just eight minutes to prepare con-
tent on a given topic and then deliver a mean-
ingful, organized and impactful speech. Aryan 
is a member of the Rockford Public Schools 
Superintendent’s Student Advisory Council, 
Auburn High School’s Debate Club, and the 
Community Foundation of Northern Illinois’ In 
Youth We Trust Council. He was also named 
a commended student by the 2020 National 
Merit Scholarship Program. I commend Aryan 
for his hard work and dedication to public 
speaking and to both his school and commu-
nity. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
Aryan that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Aryan Arora on his win in Impromptu 
Speaking at the IHSA Individual Events State 
Tournament.
