No. 26 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Loving God, I come to You this day 
in prayer for each and every person 
who labors in this place, for their 
heartfelt dedication to their tasks, for 
the commitments they have made to 
serve their country as Members, as 
staffers, interns, service providers, and 
security officers, and the whole range 
of 
duties 
and 
responsibilities 
rep-
resented in this workforce. 
None of the men and women do so 
without significant cost to themselves 
and to their families. I lift up to You 
the burdens they carry: personal illness 
and afflictions; the health and welfare 
of family members; the anxiety and 
discouragement felt when efforts are 
disregarded or unappreciated; tragedy 
and loss. 
Their 
names 
and 
situations 
are 
known to You, O Lord, but especially 
this day we pray for those who grieve 
the loss of Representative RON WRIGHT. 
We are grateful that in his living he 
showed us a principled life, the impor-
tance of integrity, and the gift of 
thoughtfulness to those around him. 
May the example of his fortitude in 
the face of life’s adversities serve as a 
testimony to the hope we have in Your 
eternal care. 
We pray in the strength of Your holy 
name. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God,

measure is to be considered. When consid-
ering concurrent resolutions on the budget, 
this requirement shall be satisfied by mak-
ing available copies of the complete Chair’s 
mark (or such material as will provide the 
basis for Committee consideration). The pro-
visions of this rule may be suspended with 
the concurrence of the Chair and Ranking 
minority member. 
(b) At least 24 hours prior to the com-
mencement of a meeting for the markup of 
legislation, the Chair shall cause the text of 
such legislation to be made publicly avail-
able in electronic form.

resolution on the budget, the Committee

mined by the Committee, to consider budget 
aggregates, functional categories, and other 
appropriate matters on a tentative basis, 
with the document before the Committee

ments may be offered to aggregates, func-
tional categories, or other appropriate mat-
ters, which have already been amended in 
their entirety. 
(b) Following adoption of the aggregates, 
functional categories, and other matters, the

incorporating such aggregates, functional 
categories, and other appropriate matters 
shall be considered for amendment and a 
final vote. 
Rule 11—Roll Call Votes 
(a) A roll call of the members may be had 
upon the request of at least one-fifth of those 
present. In the apparent absence of a 
quorum, a roll call may be had on the re-
quest of any member. 
(b) No vote may be conducted on any meas-
ure or motion pending before the Committee

Rule 12—Proxy Voting 
No vote by any member of the Committee 
on any measure or matter may be cast by

HEARINGS 
Rule 13—Announcement of Hearings 
The Chair shall make a public announce-
ment of the date, place, and subject matter 
of any Committee hearing at least one week 
before the hearing, beginning with the day in 
which the announcement is made and ending 
the day preceding the scheduled hearing un-
less the Chair, with the concurrence of the 
Ranking minority member, or the Com-
mittee by majority vote with a quorum 
present for the transaction of business, de-
termines there is good cause to begin the 
hearing sooner, in which case the Chair shall 
make the announcement at the earliest pos-
sible date. Such announcement shall be pub-
lished promptly in the Daily Digest and 
made publicly available in electronic form. 
Rule 14—Open Hearings 
(a) Each hearing conducted by the Com-
mittee or any of its task forces shall be open 
to the public except when the Committee or 
task force, in open session and with a 
quorum present, determines by roll call vote 
that all or part of the remainder of that 
hearing on that day shall be closed to the 
public because disclosure of testimony, evi-
dence, or other matters to be considered 
would endanger the national security, or 
would compromise sensitive law enforcement 
information, or would tend to defame, de-
grade, or incriminate any person, or would 
violate any law or rule of the House of Rep-
resentatives. The Committee or task forces 
may by the same procedure vote to close one 
subsequent day of hearing. 
(b) For the purposes of clause 2(g)(2) of 
Rule XI of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the task forces of the Com-
mittee are considered to be subcommittees. 
Rule 15—Member Day Hearing Requirement 
During the first session of the 117th Con-
gress, the Committee shall hold a Member 
Day Hearing to hear testimony from mem-
bers, delegates, and the resident commis-
sioner—whether or not they are a member of 
the Committee—on budget priorities and 
process. 
Rule 16—Quorum 
For the purpose of hearing testimony, not 
less than two members of the Committee 
shall constitute a quorum. 
Rule 17—Questioning Witnesses 
(a) Questioning of witnesses will be con-
ducted under the five-minute rule unless the 
Committee adopts a motion pursuant to 
clause 2(j) of Rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives. 
(b) In questioning witnesses under the five- 
minute rule: 
(1) First, the Chair and the Ranking minor-
ity member shall be recognized; 
(2) Next, the Committee members present 
at the time the hearing is called to order 
shall be recognized in order of seniority; and 
(3) Finally, the Committee members not 
present at the time the hearing is called to 
order may be recognized in the order of their 
arrival at the hearing. 
(c) In recognizing Committee members to 
question witnesses, the Chair may take into 
consideration the ratio of majority members 
to minority members and the number of ma-
jority and minority members present and 
shall apportion the recognition for ques-
tioning in such a manner as not to disadvan-
tage the members of the majority. 
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of sec-
tion (a), the Chair and Ranking minority 
member may designate an equal number of 
members from each party to question a wit-
ness for a period not longer than 30 minutes, 
or may designate staff from each party to 
question a witness for a period not longer 
than 30 minutes. 
Rule 18—Subpoenas and Oaths 
(a) In accordance with clause 2(m) of Rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives, subpoenas authorized by a majority of 
the Committee or by the Chair (pursuant to 
such rules and limitations as the Committee 
may prescribe) may be issued over the signa-
ture of the Chair or of any member of the 
Committee designated by him, and may be 
served by any person designated by the Chair 
or such member. 
(b) The Chair, or any member of the Com-
mittee designated by the Chair, may admin-
ister oaths to witnesses. 
Rule 19—Witnesses’ Statements

be submitted to the Committee at least 24 
hours in advance of presentation and shall be 
distributed to all members of the Committee 
in advance of presentation.

witness appearing in a nongovernmental ca-
pacity shall include with the written state-
ment of proposed testimony a curriculum 
vitae and a disclosure of the amount and 
source (by agency and program) of any Fed-
eral grant (or sub-grant thereof) or contract 
(or subcontract thereof) received during the 
current fiscal year or either of the two pre-
ceding fiscal years. 
(c) Such statements, with appropriate 
redactions to protect the privacy of wit-
nesses, shall be made publicly available in 
electronic form not later than one day after 
the witness appears. 
PRINTS AND PUBLICATIONS 
Rule 20—Committee Prints

tribution, unless such print or other mate-

This legislation makes clear that human 
life begins at the moment of conception and, 
therefore, the unborn are entitled to the 
same rights and protections afforded to all 
American citizens under the U.S. Constitu-
tion. In affirming human life begins at con-
ception, the unborn are granted the right to 
due process under Section 1 of the 14th 
Amendment which explicitly states, ‘‘No 
state shall make or enforce any law which 
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of 
citizens of the United States; nor shall any 
state deprive any person of life, liberty, or 
property, without due process of law; nor 
deny to any person within its jurisdiction 
the equal protection of the laws.’’ The Life 
at Conception Act allows for constitutional 
protection for the unborn that they not ‘‘be 
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without 
due process of law’’ afforded under the 5th 
Amendment.

S645 
Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2021 
No. 26 
Senate 
The Senate met at 12 noon and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
TRIAL 
OF 
DONALD 
J. 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senate will convene as a Court of Im-
peachment. 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, our shelter from the 
storms, give our Senate jurors discern-
ment that will rescue our Nation from 
ruin. Illuminate their minds with Your 
truth as You speak through the whis-
pers of conscience. Remind them that 
the seeds they plant now will bring a 
harvest. May the choices they make 
bring blessings, healing, and prosperity 
to our land. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
THE JOURNAL 
And if there is no objection, the 
Journal of proceedings of the trial are 
approved to date. 
I would ask the Sergeant at Arms to 
make the proclamation. 
The Acting Sergeant at Arms, Jen-
nifer A. Hemingway, made the procla-
mation as follows: 
Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are com-
manded to keep silence, on pain of imprison-
ment, while the Senate of the United States 
is sitting for the trial of the Article of Im-
peachment exhibited by the House of Rep-
resentatives against Donald John Trump, 
former President of the United States. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for 
the information of Senators, it is my 
understanding the schedule today will 
be similar to yesterday’s proceedings. 
We will plan to take a short break 
every 2, 3 hours, and we will accommo-
date a 30-minute recess for dinner, as-
suming it is needed. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pur-
suant to the provisions of S. Res. 47, 
the managers for the House of Rep-
resentatives have 8 hours remaining to 
make the presentation of their case. 
The Senate will now hear you, and 
the Presiding Officer recognizes Mr. 
Manager RASKIN to continue the pres-
entation of the case for the House of 
Representatives. 
MANAGERS’ PRESENTATION—RESUMED 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
thank you. 
Distinguished Senators, Representa-
tive DEGETTE
of Colorado will now 
show how the insurrectionists them-
selves believed that they were fol-
lowing President Trump’s marching or-
ders. 
Ms. Manager DEGETTE. My friends 
and colleagues, yesterday was an emo-
tionally wrenching day. As I watched 
the footage of the violence in the Cap-
itol Building, my own experience flood-
ed back to me. I was one of the un-
lucky Members who was stuck in the 
House Gallery along with Congress-
woman DEAN. 
As the House floor was cleared be-
neath of us of Members and staff, we 
could see the mob pounding on the door 
to the House Chamber. We could see 
the Capitol Police officers inside the 
Chamber pull their guns and point 
them at the intruders. Then we heard 
gunshots on the other side, and we 
flung ourselves down on the floor and 
removed our Member pins. Then we 
heard pounding on the very flimsy Gal-
lery doors right up above us. Finally, 
after that situation for some time, we 
were told to run out of the door at the 
end of the Gallery. 
As we ran through a line of police to-
ward the staircase, this is what I saw: 
the SWAT team pointing automatic 
weapons at marauders on the floor. 
Looking at these people makes you 
wonder: Who sent them here? 
In the next few minutes, I want to 
step back from the horrors of the at-
tack itself and look at January 6 from 
a totally different perspective—the 
perspective 
of 
the 
insurrectionists 
themselves. 
Their own statements before, during, 
and after the attack make clear the at-
tack was done for Donald Trump, at his 
instructions and to fulfill his wishes. 
Donald Trump had sent them there. 
They truly believed that the whole 
intrusion was at the President’s orders, 
and we know that because they said so. 
Many of them actually posed for pic-
tures, bragging about it on social 
media, and they tagged Mr. Trump in 
tweets. 
Folks, this was not a hidden crime. 
The President told them to be there, 
and so they actually believed they 
would face no punishment. 
The defense argued in their briefs, 
and they argued again here on Tuesday 
that the insurrectionists were acting 
on their own, that they were not in-
cited by President Trump or acting at 
his direction. This is in their brief: 
They did so of their own accord and for 
their own reasons, and are being criminally 
prosecuted. 
But that is just not the case. It is not 
what the insurrectionists actually said. 
They said they came here because the 
President instructed them to do so. 
Leading up to the attack, the insur-
rectionists said they were coming to 
DC for President Trump. He invited 
them with clear instructions for a spe-
cific time and place and with clear or-
ders: Stop to fight—or to fight to stop 
the certification in Congress by any 
means necessary. 
The crowd at Donald Trump’s speech 
echoed and chanted his words, and 
when people in the crowd followed his

February 11, 2021 
direction and marched to the Capitol, 
they chanted the same words as they 
breached this building. 
Now, let’s return to the speech for a 
moment. During the rally, President 
Trump led the crowd in a ‘‘Stop the 
steal’’ chant. Here is what that chant 
sounded like from the crowd’s perspec-
tive: 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
President TRUMP. (Inaudible.) And to use 
a favorite term that all of you people really 
came up with: We will stop the steal. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Stop the steal.’’) 
Soon after, the President basked as 
the crowd chanted, ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’ 
And when he incited the crowd to show 
strength, people responded: ‘‘Storm the 
Capitol.’’ ‘‘Invade the Capitol.’’ Here 
are both of those moments but from 
the crowd’s perspective: 
(Video presentation of 1–6–20201.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
President TRUMP. Thank you. 
Unidentified Speaker. Yes. 
Unidentified Speaker. Invade the Capitol 
Building. 
We also have another perspective 
from this moment, online extremist 
chatter. At the same time as the people 
in the crowd shouted, ‘‘Take the Cap-
itol Building,’’ as President Trump 
said, ‘‘Show strength,’’ a person posted 
to Parler saying: 
Time to fight. Civil war is upon us. 
Another user said: 
We are going to have a civil war. Get 
ready! 
An analysis found that members of 
‘‘Civil War’’ quadrupled on Parler in 
the hour after Donald Trump said, 
‘‘Show strength.’’ 
When the insurrectionists got to the 
Capitol, they continued those rally 
cries. Insurrectionists holding Confed-
erate flags and brandishing weapons 
cheered the President’s very words: 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. (Inaudible.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Fight. Fight. Come 
on, man. (Inaudible.) 
(People chanting. ‘‘Stop the steal.’’) 
You heard them chanting ‘‘Stop the 
steal,’’ and as the crowd chanted at the 
rally, the crowd at the Capitol made 
clear who they were doing this for. 
They also chanted ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’ 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
And it wasn’t just that they were 
doing this for Mr. Trump. They were 
following his instructions. They said he 
had invited them, and, in fact, as we 
heard, he had invited them. 
As 
one 
man 
explained 
on 
a 
livestream he taped from inside the 
Capitol, ‘‘Our president wants us here. 
. . . We wait and take orders from our 
president.’’ 
Footage from inside the Capitol 
shows when the insurrectionists first 
got into the building and confronted 
police, the mob screamed at the offi-
cers that they were listening to Presi-
dent Trump. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Stand down. You’re 
outnumbered. There’s a fucking million of us 
out there, and we are listening to Trump, 
your boss. 
The insurrectionists argued with law 
enforcement that they shouldn’t even 
be fighting them because they believed 
that the Commander in Chief was or-
dering this. This was the person’s un-
derstanding. 
When President-Elect Biden went on 
television that day to demand an end 
to the siege, one woman asked this: 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Does he not realize 
President Trump called us to siege the place? 
The examples of these types of com-
ments are endless. Don’t worry. I won’t 
play all of them. But it wasn’t just the 
words of the insurrectionists that 
proved that they did this in response to 
orders from their Commander in Chief. 
We can see this in the fact that they 
were not hiding. 
One rioter, in a livestream at the 
Capitol said: 
He’ll be happy. We’re fighting for Trump. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Let’s call Trump, 
yes. Dude, dude, let’s tell Trump. 
Unidentified Speaker. Trump would be 
very upset. 
Unidentified Speaker. They’d be like, no. 
Just say we love them. We love you, bro. 
Unidentified Speaker. No, he’ll be happy. 
What do you mean? We’re fighting for 
Trump. 
And, again, this was not an isolated 
incident. The individuals in this slide 
posted photos of themselves commit-
ting these crimes. Trump supporters 
who had broken into the Capitol were 
taking selfies, streaming live videos, 
and posing. In fact, they wanted the 
President to know: ‘‘This is me!’’ In 
fact, you can see the person wrote on 
his own posting: ‘‘This is me!’’ 
And if there were any remaining 
doubt, after hours of prompting, when 
President Trump finally told the insur-
rectionists to go home, only then did 
some of them begin to listen. 
As you previously saw, at 4:17 p.m., 
Mr. Trump released a prerecorded 
video saying to the mob: 
Go home. We love you. You’re very special. 
Shortly after he tweeted this video, a 
few of the insurrectionists who had 
seen it could be claiming victory— 
heard claiming victory—and telling 
people to go home because of Donald 
Trump’s message and instructions. 
You saw earlier the insurrectionist 
Jacob Chansley, who told someone: 
We won the day. 
A 
little 
before 
that 
video 
of 
Chansley, he said the same thing to the 
crowd through a bullhorn and in-
structed them to go home because of 
the video that President Trump had 
tweeted. Let’s watch. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Today is ours, ladies 
and gentlemen. We won the day. Today is 
ours. We won the day. That’s right. Donald 
Trump has asked everybody to just go home. 
You can look it up on his Twitter. He just 
did a video. It’s a minute long. He asked ev-
erybody to go home. 
Even after the attack, the insurrec-
tionists made clear to law enforcement 
that they were just following President 
Trump’s orders. They didn’t shy away 
from 
their 
crimes 
because 
they 
thought they were following orders 
from the Commander in Chief and so 
they would not be punished. 
They were wrong. After the attack, 
there were dozens of arrests. These 
were Federal offenses, including as-
saulting the police. When law enforce-
ment interviewed the people who were 
at the Capitol on January 6, they, once 
again, said it was because the Presi-
dent told them to be there. 
Robert Sanford was seen in this wide-
ly circulated video throwing a fire ex-
tinguisher that struck a Capitol Police 
officer outside the building. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
A witness told the FBI that Sanford 
said he had traveled to Washington, 
DC, on a bus with a group of people. 
The group had gone to the White House 
and listened to Donald J. Trump’s 
speech and then had followed the Presi-
dent’s instructions and gone to the 
Capitol. 
Folks, the insurrectionists didn’t 
just make this up. As Sanford’s lawyer 
explained: 
You’re being told, ‘‘You gotta fight like 
hell.’’ Does ‘‘fight like hell’’ mean you throw 
things at people? Maybe. 
The lawyer added that his client 
‘‘wouldn’t have been there if it wasn’t 
for the president.’’ 
Now, Sanford wasn’t the exception; 
he was the rule. In their statements 
after the attack, insurrectionists rou-
tinely echoed what they had said be-
fore and during the attack: They were 
there because the President told them 
to be. 
Now, look, the lawyers who are say-
ing that their clients were told to com-
mit these acts by Mr. Trump, well, 
they know that putting the blame on 
the President doesn’t exonerate their 
clients. They are just saying it, frank-
ly, because that is exactly what hap-
pened. 
Another Trump supporter who has 
been federally charged is Texas real es-
tate agent Jennifer Ryan. Now, Ms. 
Ryan has given many TV interviews in 
which she says she was only doing what 
the President asked her and others to 
do. She also recorded video before the 
rally talking about the mob’s plans for 
violence, and here is what she said. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Ms. RYAN. Personally, I do not feel a sense 
of shame or guilt from my heart for what I 
was doing. I thought I was following my 
President. I thought I was following what we 
were called to do. He asked us to fly there. 
He asked us to be there. So I was doing what 
he asked us to do. 
Ultimately, yes, we were going in soli-
darity with President Trump. President 
Trump requested that we be in DC on the 
6th, so this was our way of going and stop-
ping the steal. 
If it comes down to work—guess what—I’m 
going to be there. We’re all going to be up

here, and we’re going to be breaking those 
windows. 
Yet another Trump supporter who 
was arrested after breaching the Cap-
itol, Douglas Sweet, explained in a 
media interview why he did it. Refer-
ring to Donald Trump, Mr. Sweet said: 
He said, ‘‘Hey, I need my digital soldiers to 
show up on January 6.’’ And we all did. 
Some of these individuals who joined 
in the attack on our Capitol did so as 
part of violent, racist groups, which 
have been officially condemned by our 
government. Daniel Goodwyn is a self- 
proclaimed member of the Proud Boys. 
He was one of many. On November 7, 
Goodwyn tweeted a picture showing a 
Proud Boys logo surrounded by ‘‘Stand 
Back’’ and ‘‘Stand By’’ and, again, 
‘‘Stand 
back 
and 
stand 
by!’’ 
and 
‘‘Await orders from our Commander in 
Chief.’’ 
Look closely at this slide. You are 
looking at an image of Goodwyn’s own 
tweet. He was such a loyal follower of 
President Trump that he used the 
President’s photo as his own profile 
picture on Twitter. 
Now, remember, President Trump 
told them to ‘‘Stand back and stand 
by’’ at the debate. They took it as a 
call to arms. And when he called them 
to arms, they were all ready to act. 
They were waiting for their orders, 
which they got on January 6. 
And Goodwyn followed those orders. 
He stood ready as others broke into the 
windows of the Capitol and climbed in-
side. Here he is on another of the insur-
rectionist live streams in one of the 
first floor hallways of the building. 
When it became clear that Donald 
Trump was not going to save these 
folks from prosecution, when it became 
clear that the Commander in Chief had 
given 
false 
commands 
that 
went 
against this country, some of his sup-
porters even expressed regret, and they 
said they felt duped. 
Here is Jacob Chansley again, whom 
we saw in a video claiming victory 
after the President told the rioters to 
go home. Earlier in the afternoon, as 
you will recall, Chansley carried a 
spear as he breached the Capitol, en-
tered the Senate through the Gallery, 
and went right here, onto the Senate 
floor. 
Chansley left a threatening note for 
Vice President PENCE, right there on 
the Senate dais. It read: 
It’s only a matter of time. Justice is com-

On January 7, Chansley spoke to the 
FBI, and he said that he came as part 
of a group effort with other ‘‘patriots’’ 
from Arizona at the request of the 
President that all ‘‘patriots’’ come to 
DC on January 6, 2021. 
On January 14, Chansley’s lawyer 
gave an interview to Chris Cuomo, in 
which he said that Chansley was there 
‘‘at the invitation of our President, 
who said [he would] walk down Penn-
sylvania Avenue with him.’’ In fact, 
Chansley’s 
lawyer 
now 
says 
that 
Chansley felt duped by the President, 
and he regrets what the President 
brought him to do. 
This man, who ran through our halls, 
who ran into this Chamber, who sat 
right there on the dais, and who wrote 
a note for Vice President Pence that he 
was coming for him—he and those with 
him declared they would remove us 
from office if we went against Donald 
Trump. Now he is saying he would not 
have done any of that if Mr. Trump had 
told him not to. 
Chansley 
is 
not 
alone 
in 
his 
postarrest confession that he was fol-
lowing the directions of Donald Trump. 
As more and more of these people have 
been charged, the confession and the 
regret simply cascades. More and more 
insurrectionists are admitting that 
they came at Trump’s direction. 
When Riley June Williams, known 
for allegedly helping steal a laptop 
from Speaker PELOSI’s office, appeared 
in court on January 21, her lawyer said 
to the judge: ‘‘It is regrettable that Ms. 
Williams took the President’s bait and 
went inside the Capitol.’’ 
Troy Smocks, who was in the Capitol 
riot on January 6, posted online that 
day: ‘‘[T]oday President Trump told Us 
to ‘fight like hell.’’’ He also posted that 
the President ‘‘said that Our cause was 
a matter of national security.’’ 
Samuel Fisher was charged with dis-
orderly conduct and illegally being in 
the Capitol on January 6. That day, be-
fore the attack on this building, he 
wrote on his website: ‘‘Trump just 
needs to fire the bat signal . . . ’’ and 
‘‘then the pain comes.’’ 
The lawyer for Dominic Pezzola, a 
leader of the Proud Boys, who was the 
first person to break inside the Capitol, 
said that President Trump effectively 
told his client and others: 
People of the country, come on down, let 
people know what you think. [The] logical 
thinking was, ‘‘He invited us down.’’ 
Pezzola’s lawyer went on: 
These were people acting in a way they 
have never acted before, and it begs the ques-
tion, ‘‘Who lit the fuse?’’ 
On January 6, we know who lit the 
fuse. Donald Trump told these insur-
rectionists to come to the Capitol and 
stop the steal. And they did come to 
the Capitol, and they tried to stop the 
certification. They came because he 
told them to. And they did stop our 
proceedings, but only temporarily, be-
cause he told them to. 
Have you noticed, throughout this 
presentation, the uncanny similarity, 
over and over and over again, of what 
all these people are saying? They said 
what Donald Trump said, and they 
echo each other: Stand back and stand 
by. Stop the steal. Fight like hell. 
Trump sent us. We are listening to 
Trump. 
The riots that day left at least 7 peo-
ple dead; more than 150 people injured; 
Members, Senators, and our staffs all 
traumatized to this day; damage and 
pain to our Capitol; damage and pain 
to Americans; damage to our police 
force; and damage to other nations who 
have always seen us as a bastion of de-
mocracy. 
All of these people who have been ar-
rested and charged, they are being held 
accountable for their actions. Their 
leader, the man who incited them, 
must be held accountable as well. But, 
as I said earlier, you don’t have to take 
my word for it that the insurrection-
ists acted at Donald Trump’s direction. 
They said so. They were invited here. 
They were invited by the President of 
the United States. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. We were invited 
here. We were invited. Hey, we were invited 
here. We were invited by the President of the 
United States. 
Mr. 
Manager 
RASKIN. 
Senators, 
Representative DEGETTE just showed 
how the insurrectionists believed and 
understood themselves to be following 
President Trump’s marching orders. 
She explained in chilling detail how 
they were acting in perfect alignment 
with his political instructions and his 
explicit strategy to retain power. 
They did what he told them to do. 
This pro-Trump insurrection did not 
spring into life out of thin air. We saw 
how Trump spent months cultivating 
America’s most dangerous extremist 
groups. We saw how he riled them up 
with corrosive lies and violent rhet-
oric, so much so that they were ready 
and eager for their most dangerous 
mission, invalidating the will of the 
people to keep Donald Trump in office. 
We must remember that this was not 
the first time Donald Trump had in-
flamed and incited a mob. Trump knew 
that his incitement would result in vio-
lence not only because of the thou-
sands of violent messages that were 
posted all over the forums and the 
widespread news of preparations for vi-
olence among extremist groups and his 
communications on Twitter with the 
insurrectionists themselves; he knew it 
also because he had seen many of the 
exact same groups he was mobilizing 
participate in extremist violence be-
fore. Moreover, he had seen clearly how 
his own incitement of violence in 
praise after the violence took place 
galvanized, encouraged, and electrified 
these extremist followers. These tac-
tics were road-tested. 
January 6 was a culmination of the 
President’s actions, not an aberration 
from them. The insurrection was the 
most violent and dangerous episode—so 
far—in Donald Trump’s continuing pat-
tern and practice of inciting violence. 
But I emphasize ‘‘so far.’’ 
Earlier, 
Congresswoman 
PLASKETT 
showed several episodes of Trump’s in-
citement that took place during the 
Presidential election. But his encour-
agement of violence against other pub-
lic officials who he thought had crossed 
him long predates the 2020 campaign. 
The incitement of violence is always 
dangerous, but it is uniquely intoler-
able when done by the President of the 
United States of America. But that be-
came the norm. 
On President Trump’s watch, White 
supremacists 
and 
extremist 
groups 
have spread like wildfire across the 
land. His own Department of Homeland

Security called homegrown terrorism 
the No. 1 threat facing Americans 
today. But no matter how many people 
inside and outside government begged 
him to condemn extreme elements pro-
moting violence and, indeed, civil war 
in America and race war in America, 
he just wouldn’t do it, and that is be-
cause he wanted to incite and provoke 
their violence for his own political gain 
and for his own strategic objectives. 
Ever since he became President, 
Trump revealed what he thought of po-
litical violence for his side. He praised 
it, and he encouraged it. 
Right now, I am going to play for you 
just a few clips from over the years 
when the President’s words success-
fully incited his supporters into as-
saulting his opponents. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘U.S.A.’’) 
President TRUMP. See, the first group, I 
was nice: Oh, take your time. The second 
group, I was pretty nice. The third group, I’ll 
be a little more violent. And the fourth 
group, I’ll say: Get the hell out of here. 
I said: Get him the hell out of here, will 
you, please? Get him out of here. Throw him 
out. 
I get a little notice—in case you see the se-
curity guys, they are wonderful security 
guys. They said: Mr. Trump, there may be 
somebody with tomatoes in the audience. 
So if you see somebody getting ready to 
throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, 
would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the 
hell—I promise you, I will pay for the legal 
fees. I promise. 
Well, we have seen these clips and 
many, many more like them before, 
but think about the brutal power and 
effectiveness of his words with his fol-
lowers. You heard him. He told his sup-
porters to be a little more violent, and 
they responded to his command by lit-
erally dragging a protester across the 
floor at one of his campaign rallies. 
He cried: Get him the hell out of 
here. Throw him out. 
His supporters punched and kicked 
another protester as he was escorted 
from the hall. He told his supporters to 
knock the hell out of people who op-
posed him and promised to pay the 
legal fees of the assailants. 
Time after time, he encouraged vio-
lence. His supporters listened, and they 
got the message. But it wasn’t just 
Trump’s encouragement of violence 
that conditioned his supporters to par-
ticipate in this insurrection on Janu-
ary 6; it was also his explicit sanc-
tioning of the violence after it took 
place. 
Let’s watch some of those incidents, 
beginning with Trump praising sup-
porters who assaulted a Black pro-
tester. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
President TRUMP. Lying Ted Cruz. 
But we’ve had a couple that were really 
violent. And the particular one, when I said 
I would like to bang him, that was a very vi-
cious—you know, it was a guy who was 
swinging—very loud and then started swing-
ing at the audience. And you know what? 
The audience swung back. And I thought it 
was very, very appropriate. He was swinging, 
he was hitting people, and the audience hit 
back. And that is what we need a little bit 
more of. 
Unidentified Speaker. We will talk to you 
about that later. 
Unidentified Speaker. Yep. There’s not 
going to be time. 
Unidentified Speaker. I am sick and tired 
of you guys. The last time you came here 
you did the same thing. Get the hell out of 
here. 
Unidentified Speaker. You suck. 
Unidentified Speaker. Get the hell out of 
here. 
Unidentified Speaker. The last guy did the 
same thing. Are you the guardian? 
Unidentified Speaker. Yes, and you just 
broke my glasses. 
Unidentified Speaker. The last guy did the 
same damn thing. 
Unidentified 
Speaker. 
You 
just 
body- 
slammed me and broke my glasses. 
President TRUMP. Greg is smart. And, by 
the way, never wrestle him. Do you under-
stand that? Never. 
Any guy that can do a body slam, he is my 
kind— 
(People chanting: ‘‘Jews will not replace 
us.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fuck you, faggots.’’) 
Unidentified Speaker. What the fuck, you 
asshole. 
Unidentified Speaker. I am not even saying 
we are not violent. I’m saying that we 
fucking didn’t aggress. We did not initiate 
force against anybody. We are not non-
violent. We will fucking kill these people if 
we have to. 
President TRUMP. I do think there’s 
blame, yes. I think there is blame on both 
sides. You look at—you look at both sides. I 
think there is blame on both sides. You also 
had people that were very fine people on 
both sides. 
Just in case you didn’t catch all of 
that, the President praised a Repub-
lican candidate who assaulted a jour-
nalist as ‘‘my kind’’ of guy. He said 
there were ‘‘very fine people on both 
sides’’ when the neo-Nazis, the Klans-
men, and Proud Boys invaded the 
city—the great city of Charlottes-
ville—and killed Heather Heyer. And 
he said that an attack on a Black pro-
tester at one of his rallies was very, 
very appropriate. 
Does that sound familiar? Listen to 
how President Trump responded when 
asked about his own conduct on Janu-
ary 6. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Unidentified Speaker. What is your per-
sonal responsibility? 
President TRUMP. So if you read my 
speech—and many people have done it—it 
has been analyzed, and people thought that 
what I said was totally appropriate. 
So there the pattern is, staring us in 
the face. Very, very ‘‘appropriate,’’ he 
said after a man was assaulted at one 
of his rallies. ‘‘Totally appropriate’’ 
was how he characterized his incite-
ment on January 6, meaning that, of 
course, if given the chance, he would 
gladly do it again because why would 
he not engage in totally appropriate 
conduct? 
An examination of his past state-
ments makes it clear that when Donald 
Trump tells a crowd, as he did on Janu-
ary 6, ‘‘fight like hell or you won’t 
have a country anymore,’’ he meant for 
them to fight like hell. On January 6, 
that became clear to all of America. 
Now, let’s consider the events, Sen-
ators, that took place last year in 
Michigan where President Trump dem-
onstrated his willingness and his abil-
ity to incite violence against govern-
ment officials who he thought were 
getting in his way. 
When responding to extremist plots 
in Michigan, Trump showed he knew 
how to use the power of a mob to ad-
vance his political objectives. 
Beginning in March, Trump leveled 
attacks on Michigan Governor Gretch-
en Whitmer for the coronavirus poli-
cies in her State. 
On March 17, the day after Governor 
Whitmer pushed the Federal Govern-
ment to better support the States on 
COVID–19, Trump criticized her han-
dling of the pandemic, tweeting: 
Failing Michigan Governor must work 
harder and be much more proactive. We are 
pushing her to get the job done. I stand with 
Michigan! 
On March 27, he added: 
I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are 
doing such a GREAT job for them during this 
horrible 
Pandemic. 
Yet 
your 
Governor, 
Gretchen ‘‘Half’’ Whitmer is way in over her 
ahead, she doesn’t have a clue. Likes blam-
ing 
everyone 
for 
her 
own 
ineptitude! 
#MAGA. 
By April, Trump’s rhetorical attacks 
and name-calling turned to calls for 
mass mobilization of his supporters. 
This was a sign of things to come. 
On April 17, 2020, he tweeted: 
LIBERATE MICHIGAN 
Not even 2 weeks later, on April 30, 
his supporters marched on the Michi-
gan State capitol in Lansing. They 
stormed the building. Trump’s march-
ing orders were followed by aggressive 
action on the ground. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Unidentified Speaker. We have a right. Let 
us in. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Let us in.’’ 
Unidentified Speaker. Heil Hitler! Heil Hit-
ler. 
Unidentified Speaker. You policemen are 
all cowards. You betrayed us. The police 
have betrayed the people. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Lock her up up.’’) 
As the video shows, these militant 
protesters showed up ready to take a 
violent stand. They came armed and 
tightly packed themselves into the 
building with no regard, of course, for 
social distancing. 
This Trump-inspired mob may indeed 
look familiar to you: Confederate bat-
tle flags, MAGA hats, weapons, camo 
Army gear—just like the insurrection-
ists who showed up and invaded this 
Chamber on January 6. 
The siege of the Michigan State 
House was effectively a State-level 
dress rehearsal for the siege of the U.S. 
Capitol that Trump incited on January 
6. It was a preview of the coming insur-
rection. 
President Trump’s response to these 
two events was strikingly similar. Fol-
lowing the armed siege in Lansing, 
President Trump refused to condemn 
the attacks on the Michigan capitol or 
denounce the violent lawbreakers. In-
stead, he did just the opposite. He

February 11, 2021 
upheld the righteousness of his violent 
followers’ cause, and he put pressure on 
the victim of the attack to listen to his 
supporters. 
The day after the mob attack in Lan-
sing, Trump told Governor Whitmer to 
negotiate with extremists, tweeting 
that the Governor should just ‘‘give a 
little’’ to the violent men who had 
stormed the Capitol, threatening not 
only the stability of the Michigan gov-
ernment but her own life. 
As you can see, he tweeted: 
The Governor of Michigan should give a 
little, and put out the fire. These are very 
good people, but they are angry. They want 
their lives back again, safely! See them, talk 
to them, make a deal. 
The President said heavily armed ex-
tremists carrying Confederate battle 
flags and pushing past police to over-
take the Michigan State House cham-
ber are ‘‘very good people’’ and just ne-
gotiate with them. 
It is clear he doesn’t think that they 
are at fault in any way at all. But 
April 30 wasn’t the only time Trump 
supporters stormed the Michigan cap-
itol. Emboldened by the praise and his 
encouragement and support, they esca-
lated again. Governor Whitmer refused 
to capitulate to the President’s de-
mand to negotiate with them. 
Two weeks later, on May 14, Trump’s 
mob again stormed the State capitol. 
This time, as you can see here, one 
man brought a doll with a noose 
around the neck, foreshadowing the ap-
pearance of the large gallows erected 
outside of this building, downstairs 
from here, on January 6, as the crowd 
chanted—and I still can hear the words 
ringing in my ear—‘‘Hang Mike Pence. 
Hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike Pence.’’ 
Over the coming months, even after a 
crowd threatening Governor Whitmer 
stormed the capitol, Trump continued 
to assail her in public. At a rally in 
Michigan on September 10, Trump 
whipped up the crowd against Governor 
Whitmer saying: 
She doesn’t have a clue about reopening 
her own state’s economy. 
The crowd cheered. 
Then, on October 8, the precise con-
sequences of the President’s incite-
ment to violence were revealed to the 
whole world. 
(Video presentation.) 
Look at this. Thirteen men were ar-
rested by the FBI for plotting to storm 
the Michigan State capitol building, 
launch a civil war, kidnap Governor 
Whitmer, transport her to Wisconsin, 
and then try and execute her. 
This 
was 
an 
assassination 
con-
spiracy, a kidnapping conspiracy. Look 
at the language that they used. In the 
charging document, the FBI reported 
that one of the conspirators said he 
needed ‘‘200 men’’ to storm the capitol 
building and take political hostages, 
including the Governor. The suspect 
called it a ‘‘snatch and grab, man. Grab 
the [f’ing] Governor.’’ 
One of those men already pled guilty 
to this conspiracy. 
The plot was well organized, just like 
the one that was coming on January 6. 
The men in Michigan even considered 
building Molotov cocktails to disarm 
police vehicles and attempted to con-
struct their own IEDs—something that 
actually happened here on January 6. 
Police authorities arrested extremists 
who had weapons and materials to 
build explosive devices, including one 
man found with an assault rifle and 
enough materials to make 11 Molotov 
cocktails. 
On September 17, 2020, one of the 
Michigan conspiracists posted: 
When the time comes there will be no need 
to try and strike fear through presence. The 
fear will be manifested through bullets. 
And what did Donald Trump do as 
President of the United States to de-
fend one of our Nation’s Governors 
against a plotted kidnapping by violent 
insurrections? Did he publicly condemn 
violent domestic extremists who hoped 
and planned to launch a civil war in 
America? No, not at all. He further in-
flamed them by continuing to attack 
the Governor who was the object of 
their hatred in this kidnapping con-
spiracy. 
The very night this conspiracy be-
came 
public 
and 
that 
Governor 
Whitmer learned that there were 13 
men who were planning to kidnap and 
likely kill her, Trump did not condemn 
the violence. He did not criticize the 
extremists. He didn’t even check on 
Governor Whitmer’s safety. He chose 
to vilify Governor Whitmer again and 
then, amazingly, took credit for foiling 
the plot against her, demanding her 
gratitude, and then quickly, of course, 
changed the subject to antifa. He 
tweeted: 
Governor Whitmer . . . has done a terrible 
job. 
He demanded that she thank him for 
the law enforcement operation that 
had foiled the kidnapping conspiracy 
that had been encouraged by his rhet-
oric. 
On October 17, a little over a week 
after these people were arrested for 
preparing to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, 
Donald Trump riled up the boisterous 
crowd in Muskegon with more personal 
attacks on Whitmer, driving the crowd 
to chant ‘‘Lock her up. Lock her up.’’ 
He had now seen that some of his fol-
lowers were prepared to engage in 
criminal violence with orchestrated at-
tacks, deadly weapons, and willing bod-
ies to storm a State capitol building 
and to attack his perceived political 
enemies, and so as the crowd chanted 
‘‘Lock her up,’’ he pivoted to his next 
goal. He told them they couldn’t trust 
the Governor to administer fair elec-
tions in Michigan. He used the crowd 
that he knew would readily engage in 
violence to prepare his followers for his 
next and, of course, his paramount po-
litical objective: claiming the election 
was stolen and inciting insurrectionary 
action. 
He did it again on October 27 during 
a preelection rally speech in Lansing, 
MI, 
where 
the 
capitol 
had 
been 
stormed. Trump openly joked with the 
crowd about critics saying his words 
had provoked the violent plot against 
Governor Whitmer. Check it out. It is 
telling. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
President TRUMP. We got to get her 
going. I don’t think she likes me too much. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Lock her up.’’) 
President TRUMP. See, I don’t comment 
to that because every time, if I make just 
even a little bit of a nod, they say: ‘‘The 
President led them on.’’ No, I don’t have to 
lead you on. Even a little nod, they say: 
‘‘The President said.’’ Your Governor, at the 
urging of her husband, who has abused our 
system very badly—the only man allowed in 
the State of Michigan—the only man allowed 
to go sailing is her husband. Now, your Gov-
ernor—I don’t think she likes me too much. 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I’m the one. It was our 
people that helped her out with her problem. 
I mean, we have to see if it is a problem, 
right? People are entitled to say maybe it 
was a problem, maybe it wasn’t. It was our 
people—my people—our people that helped 
her out. 
So President Trump offered them a 
little winking inside joke about his 
constant incitement of the mob and 
how much can actually be commu-
nicated by him with just a little nod— 
just a little nod. 
He presided over another pounding, 
rhythmic rendition of his trademark 
chant: ‘‘Lock her up. Lock her up.’’ 
Then, referring to the FBI’s foiling of 
the kidnapping conspiracy, which was 
deadly serious, he said that he helped 
her out with a problem. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Maybe it was a problem; maybe it wasn’t. 
We will have to see. 
Maybe it was a problem; maybe it wasn’t. 
The President of the United States of 
America—he could not bring himself to 
publicly oppose a kidnapping and po-
tential assassination conspiracy plot 
against a sitting Governor of one of our 
50 States? 
Trump knew exactly what he was 
doing in inciting the January 6 mob— 
exactly. He had just seen how easily 
his words and actions inspired riots in 
Michigan. He sent a clear message to 
his supporters. He encouraged planning 
and conspiracies to take over capitol 
buildings and threaten public officials 
who refused to bow down to his polit-
ical will. 
Is there any chance Donald Trump 
was surprised by the results of his own 
incitement? Let’s do what Tom Paine 
told us to do, use our common sense, 
the sense we have in common as citi-
zens. 
If we don’t draw the line here, what 
is next? What makes you think the 
nightmare with Donald Trump and his 
lawmaking and violent mobs is over? If 
we let him get away with it and then it 
comes to your State capital or it comes 
back here again, what are we going to 
say? 
These prior acts of incitement cast a 
harsh light on Trump’s obvious in-
tent—obvious intent—his unavoidable 
knowledge of the consequences of his 
incitement, the unavoidable knowledge 
of the consequences of his incitement, 
and the clear foreseeability of the vio-
lent harm that he unleashed on our 
people and our Republic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S650 
February 11, 2021 
January 6 was not some unexpected, 
radical break from his normal law- 
abiding and peaceful disposition. This 
was his state of mind. This was his es-
sential M.O. He knew that, egged on by 
his tweets, his lies, and his promise of 
a wild time in Washington to guar-
antee his grip on power, his most ex-
treme followers would show up bright 
and early, ready to attack, ready to en-
gage in violence, ready to fight like 
hell for their hero, just like they an-
swered his call in Michigan. 
President Trump has said over and 
over his supporters are loyal. In his 
own words, his supporters are the 
‘‘most loyal’’ we have seen in our coun-
try’s history. He knew that his most 
hardcore supporters were willing to di-
rect violence at elected officials—in-
deed, to attack and lay siege to a cap-
itol building—and he knew they would 
be ready to heed his call on January 6 
to stop the steal by using violence to 
block the peaceful transfer of power in 
the United States. He knew they were 
coming. He brought them here, and he 
welcomed them with open arms: 
We hear you (and love you) from the Oval 
Office. 
My dear colleagues, is there any po-
litical leader in this room who believes 
that if he is ever allowed by the Senate 
to get back into the Oval Office, Don-
ald Trump would stop at inciting vio-
lence to get his way? Would you bet 
the lives of more police officers on 
that? Would you bet the safety of your 
family on that? Would you bet the fu-
ture your democracy on that? 
President Trump declared his con-
duct totally appropriate, so if he gets 
back into office and it happens again, 
we will have no one to blame but our-
selves. 
Mr. LIEU will return now to tell you 
about President Trump’s total lack of 
remorse after the insurrection. 
Mr. Manager LIEU. Good afternoon. 
My colleagues walked you through 
President Trump’s actions leading up 
to January 6 and then the horrific 
events on January 6, and we saw both 
during the attack as well as in the days 
after the attack that this was a Presi-
dent who showed no remorse and took 
no accountability—in fact, quite the 
opposite. As Representative RASKIN 
showed you, President Trump claimed 
that his actions were ‘‘totally appro-
priate.’’ 
The assertion that everyone thought 
Donald Trump’s actions were totally 
appropriate, including people in this 
room, is, of course, untrue. It is also 
dangerous. That is why Members of 
Congress and U.S. Senators, former and 
current administration officials, State 
and local officials, all unequivocally 
confirm what we witnessed with our 
own eyes—that Donald Trump’s con-
duct was wrong, it was destructive, dis-
honorable, and un-American. 
President Trump’s lack of remorse 
and refusal to take accountability dur-
ing the attack shows his state of mind. 
It shows that he intended the events of 
January 6 to happen, and when it did, 
he delighted in it. 
President Trump’s lack of remorse 
and refusal to take accountability 
after the attack poses its own unique 
and continuing danger. It sends the 
message that it is acceptable to incite 
a violent insurrection to overthrow the 
will of the people and that a President 
of the United States can do that and 
get away with it. 
That is why we have to hold Presi-
dent Trump accountable, to send a 
message that it is never patriotic to in-
cite a violent attack against our Na-
tion’s Capitol and that future Presi-
dents will know that they cannot fol-
low in Donald Trump’s footsteps and 
get away with it. 
So let’s start with the day of the at-
tack. On insurrection day, January 6, 
President Trump did not once condemn 
the attack, not even once. Even when 
he finally asked the violent extremists 
to go home, which was 3 hours after the 
attack began, he sends this video, and 
he ends it with ‘‘You’re very special. 
We love you.’’ That was his message to 
people who perpetrated this violent, 
gruesome attack—‘‘We love you’’—and 
then 2 hours later, he tweets ‘‘Remem-
ber this day forever.’’ 
This is not a man who showed re-
morse, but it is worse than that. After 
that tweet, it took him another full 
day to even condemn the attack itself. 
The very next day, President Trump 
was eerily silent, and then at 7:01 p.m., 
he releases a prerecorded video, and 
there, President Trump for the first 
time, nearly 30 hours after the attack 
began, acknowledges and condemns the 
violent mayhem that occurred. He said 
the demonstrators ‘‘defiled the seat of 
American democracy.’’ He said that 
these demonstrators didn’t represent 
this country and if they broke the law, 
they would pay. 
But even in that video, he says more 
lies. He says in that very same video 
that he immediately deployed the Na-
tional Guard. That, again, is not true. 
The National Guard was not deployed 
until over 2 hours after the attack 
began at around 3 p.m. Because of this 
late deployment, the National Guard 
did not arrive until after 5 p.m. 
When the Guard was deployed, the 
Pentagon had released a statement 
that showed the list of people—and you 
saw that list—of folks that were con-
sulted before deploying the National 
Guard. 
Several people were on their list, in-
cluding the Vice President. President 
Trump was not on that list. You know, 
as a veteran, I find it deeply dishonor-
able that our Commander in Chief did 
not protect us. Then, later, he tried to 
take credit for something he failed to 
do. Shameful. 
Also, in that video, you should note 
what it did not say. Absent from that 
entire video was any actual acceptance 
of responsibility for his actions. Absent 
from that video was a call to his most 
fervent supporters to never do this 
again. And here was his final message 
in that so-called condemnation-of-at-
tack video. 
Here is what he actually said: 
(Text of video presentation of 1–7– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. And to all of my won-
derful supporters, I know you are dis-
appointed, but I also want you to know that 
our incredible journey is only just beginning. 
President Trump not only failed to 
show remorse or take accountability, 
he made clear he is just beginning. 
For days, he did not address the Na-
tion after this attack. We needed our 
Commander in Chief to lead, to unite a 
grieving country, to comfort us. But 
what did President Trump do? Nothing. 
Silence. We are all aware that a violent 
mob murdered a police officer. It took 
President Trump 3 days before he low-
ered the flag of the United States of 
America—3 
days—and 
President 
Trump, who was Commander in Chief 
at the time, did not attend and pay re-
spects to the officer who lay in state in 
the very building that he died defend-
ing. 
Now, some people have argued that 
President Trump made a mistake; that 
he gets a mulligan, but we know Presi-
dent Trump didn’t make a mistake be-
cause, you see, if you or I make a mis-
take when something very bad hap-
pens, we would show remorse; we would 
accept responsibility. President Trump 
didn’t do any of that. Why not? Be-
cause he intended for what happened 
on January 6. And how do we know 
that? He told us. 
On January 12, as President Trump 
was boarding Air Force One, headed to 
Texas—and you saw this video before, 
and I am going to show it again—he 
was asked by a reporter: 
What is your role in what happened at the 
Capitol? What is your personal responsi-
bility? 
This was his response: 
(Text of video presentation of 1–12– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. But they’ve analyzed 
my speech and my words and my final para-
graph, my final sentence, and everybody, to 
the T, thought it was totally appropriate. 
On January 12, President Trump had 
seen the violent attack on the Capitol. 
He knew people had died, and his mes-
sage to all of us was that his conduct 
was totally appropriate. 
I am a former prosecutor, and we are 
trained to recognize lack of remorse, 
but it doesn’t take a prosecutor to un-
derstand that President Trump was not 
showing remorse; he was showing defi-
ance. He was telling us that he would 
do this again; that he could do this 
again; that he and future Presidents 
can run for national election, lose an 
election, inflame the supporters for 
months, and then incite an insurrec-
tion and that that would be totally ap-
propriate. 
One week after the attack, on Janu-
ary 13, President Trump, in response to 
continuing bipartisan criticism, re-
leased another video. 
Here is part of what he said: 
(Text of video presentation of 1–13– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. I want to be very clear. 
I unequivocally condemn the violence that

February 11, 2021 
we saw last week. Violence and vandalism 
have absolutely no place in our country and 
no place in our movement. 
President Trump, of course, needed 
to make that statement. He needed to 
unequivocally condemn that attack, 
but he also needed to mean those 
words. You saw Donald Trump tweet 
endless attacks—sometimes 108 tweets 
in a day—and in public speeches and 
across 
rallies, 
repeating 
words 
of 
‘‘Fight’’ and ‘‘Stop the steal’’ and 
‘‘Never surrender.’’ You know what it 
looks 
like 
when 
President 
Trump 
wants to convey a message. Forcefully, 
loudly, and repeatedly he does that. 
This video, sent after a week of the 
attack, was not that. We know this be-
cause, in this video, he again does not 
show remorse and does not take re-
sponsibility. He again does not ac-
knowledge his role in the insurrection. 
He does not say in that video, for ex-
ample, ‘‘Everything I said in the 
months prior went too far,’’ and he 
does not say the one sentence that 
matters. He does not say the one sen-
tence that would stop future political 
violence: ‘‘The election was not sto-
len.’’ He still hasn’t said that sentence. 
That is why National Guard troops, in 
full body armor, still patrol outside. 
Reports from the White House also 
confirm that President Trump believed 
he was ‘‘forced by the bipartisan furor 
after the insurrection to acknowledge 
the new administration.’’ We know he 
did not stand behind his belated con-
demnation because those around him 
confirmed it. Behind closed doors, 
sources 
confirmed 
that 
President 
Trump still refused to directly ac-
knowledge his election loss to Joe 
Biden. He refused to even attend the 
peaceful transition of power—the first 
President in modern history. President 
Trump even, reportedly, while watch-
ing the impeachment vote, ‘‘focused his 
ire’’ on the Republicans who voted for 
his impeachment, peppering aides with 
questions about ‘‘what he could do to 
exact revenge.’’ 
President Trump has made clear 
that, if he is not held accountable, he 
will not be accountable. He will not 
stop. Now, President Trump would 
have his base and the world believe 
that his conduct was totally appro-
priate. It is important to impeach that 
falsehood, to make clear to his sup-
porters and everyone watching that 
what Donald Trump did was not ac-
ceptable—in fact, quite the opposite. 
People in his own party—State offi-
cials, former officials, current officials, 
Members of Congress—have, unambig-
uously and passionately, said that 
what Donald Trump did was ‘‘disgrace-
ful,’’ ‘‘shameful,’’ and have called his 
behavior ‘‘existential’’ and ‘‘wrong,’’ 
and they have said that his actions 
gave rise to one of the darkest chapters 
in United States’ history. 
Let’s hear what some of these offi-
cials had to say. Here are Governors 
Spencer Cox, Charlie Baker, Mike 
DeWine, Larry Hogan, and Phil Scott. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–11– 
2021.) 
Mr. Cox. And people have to be held ac-
countable. And yes, that includes the Presi-
dent. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–7– 
2021.) 
Mr. Baker. It’s important to remember 
that they were the culmination of months of 
President Trump repeating over and over 
again that the American electoral system is 
a fraud. After he stoked the flames of out-
rage for weeks leading up to the events of 
yesterday, he refused to adequately pre-
pare the U.S. Capitol for the possibility 
of violence and left it nearly defense-
less. His remarks during and after the 
travesty of the attack on the Capitol 
were disgraceful. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–7– 
2021.) 
Mr. DeWine. President Trump’s continued 
refusal to accept the election results without 
producing credible evidence of a rigged elec-
tion has stirred the fire that has threatened 
to burn down our democracy. This incen-
diary speech yesterday, the one he gave pre-
ceding the march, that he gave to the pro-
testers, served only to fan those flames. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–7– 
2021.) 
Mr. Hogan. I proudly stood by my father’s 
side at age 12 on the floor of the House 
Chamber as we both took the oath of office, 
an oath to support and defend the Constitu-
tion of the United States. It’s clear to me 
that President Trump has abandoned this sa-
cred oath. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–7– 
2021.) 
Mr. Scott. Seeing our Capitol, a symbol of 
democracy around the world, stormed by an 
angry mob was heartbreaking. And let me be 
clear: These actions were not patriotic, and 
these people are not patriots. The fact that 
these flames of hate and insurrection were 
lit by the President of the United States will 
be remembered as one of the darkest chap-
ters in our Nation’s history. 
One of the darkest chapters in our 
Nation’s history. 
Former members of the Trump ad-
ministration, 
longstanding 
Repub-
licans, also made clear that President 
Trump incited this insurrection and 
that it went against our democracy. 
The President’s former Secretary of 
Defense, James Mattis, declared: 
[T]oday’s violent assault on our Capitol, an 
effort to subjugate American democracy by 
mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump. 
Former White House Chief of Staff 
John Kelly spoke on this as well, and I 
would like to play an audio clip of 
what he said. 
(Text of audio presentation of 1–7– 
2021.) 
Mr. Kelly. [W]hat happened on Capitol Hill 
. . . was a direct result of him poisoning the 
minds of people with the lies and the fraud. 
If you couldn’t hear that, what John 
Kelly said about President Trump was 
that what happened on Capitol Hill was 
a direct result of his poisoning the 
minds of people with the lies and the 
fraud. 
Former Speaker of the House John 
Boehner declared: 
[T]he invasion of our Capitol by a mob, in-
cited by lies from some entrusted with 
power, is a disgrace to all who sacrificed to 
build our Republic. 
This was echoed by former Trump of-
ficial after former Trump official. 
Here is what former National Secu-
rity Advisors John Bolton and H.R. 
McMaster, former White House Com-
munications Director Alyssa Farah, 
and 
former 
Chief 
of 
Staff 
Mick 
Mulvaney said: 
(Text of video presentation of 1–7– 
2021.) 
Mr. Tapper. Let me just ask you: Do you 
think President Trump has blood on his 
hands? 
Mr. Bolton. I think he does. Look, I agree 
with Bill Barr. I think he did incite this mob 
with the clear intention of having them dis-
rupt the electoral college certification and 
delay it to give him more time. I don’t think 
there’s any question about it. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–7– 
2021.) 
Mr. McMaster. There are many reasons for 
this assault on the Capitol, but foremost 
among them was the President’s exhor-
tations, 
was 
the 
President’s 
sustained 
disinformation. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–17– 
2021.) 
Mr. McMaster. We’ve seen a President 
stoking fears amidst these crises. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–17– 
2021.) 
Ms. Farah. First and foremost, I want to 
say that what happened at the Capitol was 
unacceptable, un-American, undemocratic. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–8– 
2021.) 
Mr. Mulvaney. I think everybody recog-
nizes that what happened on Wednesday is 
different. You can go down the long litany of 
things that people complained about with 
Donald Trump, and I could probably defend 
almost all of them. Many of them were pol-
icy differences; many of them were stylistic 
differences, but Wednesday was different. 
Wednesday was existential. Wednesday is one 
of those things that struck to the very heart 
of what it means to be an American, and it 
was wrong. 
Mick Mulvaney, President Trump’s 
former Chief of Staff, is clearly saying 
what we all felt—that January 6 was 
different. It was existential. It was 
wrong. It was un-American. 
This sentiment was echoed not just 
from people outside the administration 
but from people inside the Trump ad-
ministration. Perhaps the most telling 
was the flood of resignations from peo-
ple inside President Trump’s adminis-
tration with firsthand access to Presi-
dent Trump. His own officials felt so 
betrayed by his conduct that numerous 
officials resigned in protest days before 
the end of President Trump’s term. 
Sixteen officials resigned in protest— 
16. They all took this dramatic action 
of resigning because they saw the clear 
link between President Trump’s con-
duct and the violent insurrection. 
Here is some of what they said. 
Secretary DeVos, who was in the ad-
ministration the entire term, told 
President Trump in her resignation let-
ter: 
[T]here is no mistaking the impact your 
rhetoric had on the situation, and it is an in-
flection point for me. 
Secretary Chao, who was in the ad-
ministration 
the 
entire 
term, 
ex-
plained:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S652 
February 11, 2021 
Yesterday, our country experienced a trau-
matic and entirely avoidable event as sup-
porters of the President stormed the Capitol 
building following a rally he addressed. As 
I’m sure is the case with many of you, it has 
deeply troubled me in a way I simply cannot 
set aside. 
Deputy Costello told his associates 
the attack was his ‘‘breaking point’’ 
and, he hoped, ‘‘a wake-up call.’’ 
These rebukes and resignations from 
President Trump’s own administration 
make clear that President Trump’s 
conduct was anything but totally ap-
propriate. They also remind us that 
this can and must be a wake-up call. 
As Representative FRED
UPTON
so 
eloquently put it, ‘‘[President Trump] 
expressed no regrets for last week’s 
violent insurrection at the U.S. Cap-
itol. This sends exactly the wrong sig-
nal to those of us who support the very 
core of our democratic principles and 
took a solemn oath to the Constitu-
tion. . . . It is time to say: Enough is 
enough.’’ 
Now, no one is saying here that 
President Trump cannot contest the 
election. Of course, he can. But what 
President Trump did, as his former 
Chief of Staff explained, was different. 
It was dishonorable, it was un-Amer-
ican, and it resulted in fatalities. 
President Trump spent months inflam-
ing his supporters, spread lies to incite 
a violent attack on our Capitol, on our 
law enforcement, and on all of us. 
And then he lied again to his base to 
tell them that this was all OK, that 
this was all acceptable. And that is 
why President Trump is so dangerous— 
because he would have all of us, all 
Americans, believe that any President 
who comes after him can do exactly 
the same thing. 
That is why lack of remorse is an im-
portant factor in impeachment, be-
cause impeachment, conviction, and 
disqualification is not just about the 
past. It is about the future. It is mak-
ing sure that no future official, no fu-
ture President does the same exact 
thing President Trump does. 
President Trump’s lack of remorse 
shows that he will undoubtedly cause 
future harm if allowed, because he still 
refuses to account for his previous 
grave crime against our government. 
You know, I am not afraid of Donald 
Trump running again in 4 years. I am 
afraid he is going to run again and lose 
because he can do this again. 
We are in an unusual situation be-
cause, despite President Trump’s claim 
that everyone thinks what he did was 
fine, so many have come out and spo-
ken so strongly and passionately about 
what happened here. 
I would like to highlight a statement 
by Representative ANTHONY GONZALEZ. 
He said: 
The Vice President and both chambers of 
Congress had their lives put in grave danger 
as a result of the President’s actions in the 
events leading up to and on January 6th. 
During the attack itself, the President aban-
doned his post while many members asked 
for 
help, 
thus 
further 
endangering 
all 
present. These are fundamental threats not 
just to people’s lives but to the very founda-
tion of our Republic. 
And now I would like to show what 
Members of Congress said leading up to 
the most bipartisan impeachment vote 
in U.S. history, because I do want ev-
eryone watching, especially President 
Trump’s supporters, to see firsthand 
what I believe we all feel—that what 
President Trump did was not appro-
priate, that it was not American, and 
that it absolutely cannot stand. 
(Text of Videotape presentation 1/7/ 
2021.) 
Ms. CHENEY. What he has done and what 
he has caused here is something that we’ve 
never seen before in our history. 
(Text of Videotape presentation 1/7/ 
2021.) 
Mr. KINZINGER. All indications are that 
the president has become unmoored not just 
from his duty or even his oath but from re-
ality itself. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–12– 
2021.) 
Mr. KATKO. The President’s role in this 
insurrection is undeniable. Both on social 
media ahead of January 6 and in his speech 
that day, he deliberately promoted baseless 
theories creating a combustible environment 
of misinformation and division. To allow the 
President of the United States to incite this 
attack without consequences is a direct 
threat to the future of [this] democracy. 
After this trial, I hope you will come 
together and cast your vote and make 
absolutely clear how we, as a Congress 
and as a nation, feel about what Don-
ald Trump did by convicting him, and 
to prevent this from being ‘‘only the 
beginning,’’ as President Trump said, 
and to deter future Presidents who do 
not like the outcome of a national 
election from believing they can follow 
in President Trump’s footsteps. 
It is what our Constitution requires. 
It is what our country deserves. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Representa-
tive DEGETTE will now return to show 
how extremists were emboldened by 
the insurrection and planned to attack 
the inauguration. 
Ms. Manager DEGETTE. My col-
leagues have showed you the over-
whelming evidence of how President 
Trump’s conduct assembled, incited, 
and inflamed the mob. We showed how 
and why this attack, this violence, was 
not only foreseeable but preventable. 
We showed that President Trump knew 
his conduct could and would result in 
violence, and that when the attack oc-
curred, he did not fulfill his duty as 
Commander in Chief and defend us. In-
stead, he was delighted. 
Donald Trump incited a violent in-
surrection and he failed to defend our 
Nation, our Capitol, this Congress, and 
our law enforcement from the attack 
he incited. 
Now I want to turn to the impact, 
the long-term harm of this conduct. 
My colleagues and I will walk through 
the breadth and gravity of this harm. 
I would like to start with the effect 
President Trump’s conduct had on our 
domestic security. We saw firsthand 
how 
Donald 
Trump’s 
conduct 
emboldened and escalated domestic vi-
olence extremists. These folks are 
known in the law enforcement commu-
nity as DVEs. 
These threats were and are made 
worse by President Trump’s refusal to 
take accountability and his refusal to 
forcibly denounce what his own FBI 
identified as some of the most dan-
gerous elements of our country. Even 
as 
the 
attack 
was 
underway, 
he 
tweeted words of support to his violent 
supporters, and then, in the aftermath 
on January 7, President Trump made it 
clear this was only the beginning. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–7– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. And to all of my won-
derful supporters, I know you are dis-
appointed, but I also want you to know that 
our incredible journey is only just beginning. 
And he was right. Unless we take ac-
tion, the violence is only just begin-
ning. In the aftermath of the attack, 
we saw a huge rise in threats from do-
mestic violence extremists, including 
specific threats to the inauguration in 
DC, and also to all 50 State capitols. 
Our intelligence Agencies confirmed 
that, in addition to these specific 
threats, President Trump’s conduct 
emboldened the very same violent 
groups who initiated the attack and 
sparked new violent coalitions. 
These groups believe that they are 
following his orders. They believe that 
their acts of insurrection and violence 
are patriotic. 
Violence is never patriotic, and it is 
never American. It is not the Demo-
cratic way, and it is not the Repub-
lican way. 
After the attack, the Nation’s top de-
fense and law enforcement Agencies re-
ported an increase in credible threats 
to 
the 
inauguration 
from 
Donald 
Trump’s supporters. 
On January 13, 2021, a joint intel-
ligence bulletin issued by the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, the FBI, 
and 
the 
National 
Counterterrorism 
Center found: 
Since the 6 January event, violent online 
rhetoric regarding the 20 January Presi-
dential Inauguration has increased, with 
some calling for unspecified ‘justice’ for the 
6 January fatal shooting by law enforcement 
of a participant who had illegally entered 
the Capitol Building, and another posting 
that ‘many’ armed individuals would return 
on 19 January. 
The Agencies also made clear why 
these threats were escalating, espe-
cially regarding the inauguration. The 
report explained that a primary moti-
vating factor was: 
The shared false narrative of a ‘‘stolen’’ 
election and opposition to the change in con-
trol of the executive and legislative branches 
of the Federal Government may lead some 
individuals to adopt the belief that there is 
no political solution to address their griev-
ances and that violent action is necessary. 
In other words, President Trump’s 
spreading 
of 
inflammatory 
disinformation about the election in-
cited the insurrection on January 6 and 
may lead to further violence. 
Online, just as they did prior to the 
January 6 attack, Trump supporters

took to the internet to organize and 
document their desire and plans for fu-
ture violence at President Biden’s in-
auguration. And indeed, in the days 
shortly after the attack, several post-
ers on extremist social media websites 
made further plans for violence. 
They posted: 
Many of us will return on January 19, 2021, 
carrying our weapons, in support of our na-
tion’s resolve, to which [sic] the world will 
never forget!!! We will come in numbers that 
no standing army or police agency can 
match. 
We took the building once [and] we can 
take it again. 
Other users, eager to participate in 
additional 
attacks, 
confirmed 
that 
they 
were 
waiting 
on 
President 
Trump’s instructions about what to do 
next. 
Referring to a future planned attack, 
a user on the online platform known as 
Gab posted: 
I’d like to come do this, but want to know, 
does our President want us there? Awaiting 
instructions. 
In fact, in the days leading up to the 
inauguration, 
multiple 
individuals— 
many, potentially, in an attempt to 
carry 
out 
the 
plots 
that 
I 
just 
previewed—were 
arrested 
in 
Wash-
ington, DC, including on serious weap-
ons charges. 
One of those men was Couy Griffin, 
the founder of Cowboys for Trump, who 
took part in the Capitol attack and 
was also arrested on January 17. 
Here is what he said about his plans 
for violence. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–17– 
2021.) 
Mr. Griffin. You know, you want to say 
that that was a mob? You want to say that 
was violence? No, sir. No ma’am. No. We 
could have a Second Amendment rally on 
those same steps that we had that rally yes-
terday. You know, and if we do, then it’s 
going to be a sad day, because there is going 
to be blood running out of that building. But 
at the end of the day, you mark my word, we 
will plant our flag on the desk of Nancy 
Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. 
‘‘Blood running out of that build-
ing’’—this building, the Capitol, where 
all of us are right now. 
Now, the name Couy Griffin may 
sound familiar because he previously 
faced controversy for a May 2020 video, 
where he said: 
Mr. Griffin. The only good Democrat is a 
dead Democrat. 
Hear it from him yourself. 
(Text of video presentation of 5–27– 
2021.) 
Mr. Griffin. What I’ve come to the conclu-
sion is, the only good Democrat is a dead 
Democrat. 
Now, when he said this, President 
Trump actually retweeted Griffin and 
thanked him for that sentiment. 
When Donald Trump retweeted this, 
he was no stranger to Griffin. In fact, 
in March 2019, over a year earlier, Grif-
fin and Trump had spoken on the phone 
for nearly 30 minutes. 
President Trump’s conduct, without 
a doubt, made it clear that he sup-
ported Griffin. In fact, Griffin even said 
so himself. 
As Griffin later said about President 
Trump retweeting his inflammatory 
comment about the dead Democrats: 
It really means a lot to me, because I know 
that the president of the United States has 
my back. 
Remember, this is a man who was 
here on January 6, who was arrested 
after threatening to come back here to 
make blood come running out of this 
building. 
Threats like Griffin’s have triggered 
a deployment of forces the likes of 
which we have never seen. There were 
approximately 25,000 National Guard 
troops brought in from around the 
country to protect DC leading up to 
and on Inauguration Day. 
As you know, many of those troops 
are still here. 
Take a look at that. 
These were scenes that played out all 
over the country. Five days following 
the siege on the Capitol, on January 11, 
2021, the FBI warned: 
Armed protests are being planned at all 50 
State capitols from 16 January through at 
least 20 January, and at the U.S. Capitol 
from 17 January through 20 January. 
As a result, at least 21 States acti-
vated their National Guards in prepa-
ration for potential attacks. President 
Trump’s incitement has reverberated 
around the country, prompting massive 
law enforcement mobilization in sev-
eral State capitols, including in Wash-
ington, Illinois, Michigan, and Georgia. 
Look at these photos. This is what 
Donald Trump has done to America. 
This massive deployment of law en-
forcement has cost the taxpayers dear-
ly. The National Guard deployment to 
DC alone is expected to cost at least 
$480 million. The bills are also racking 
up in the States. North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Wis-
consin have each spent about half a 
million dollars to safeguard their cap-
itols in the run up to the inauguration. 
Ohio spent $1.2 million over this same 
2-week period. And, remember, this is 
at a time when State budgets are al-
ready suffering under the weight of the 
pandemic. 
Our brave servicemembers showed 
up. Thanks to their dedication and 
their vigilance, the inauguration and 
the days leading up to it mercifully 
proceeded without incident. In fact, 
after news broke of law enforcement’s 
preparedness for further attacks, lead-
ers of the Proud Boys and the Three 
Percenters militia, the organizers of 
the Million MAGA March, they all now 
told their followers to avoid protests at 
or leading up to the inauguration for 
fear that law enforcement would crush 
them and arrest rioters who showed up. 
Thank God there wasn’t an insurrec-
tion sequel here on January 20, but 
look at the price we have paid—the 
price that we are still paying. It is not 
just dollars and cents. This Capitol has 
become a fortress, as State capitols 
have all across the country. Our con-
stituents no longer have access to their 
elected representatives. Every Demo-
crat and Republican, including people 
who came here on January 6 peace-
fully, is paying the price. And it is not 
just a loss of access; it is a dimming of 
their freedom. It is a dimming of all of 
our freedom. 
We must uphold our oaths, as the 
tens of thousands of law enforcement 
officers have done in the wake of Janu-
ary 6, because if we do not, President 
Trump’s mob stands ready for more at-
tacks. 
Now, this should be no surprise. Hav-
ing a Commander in Chief who incites 
violence has given life to the existing 
violent groups he spent years culti-
vating and has inspired new coalitions 
among extremist groups who actually 
view January as a success. According 
to the FBI, President Trump’s assem-
blage of his mob was particularly dan-
gerous because ‘‘in-person engagement 
between DVEs of differing ideological 
goals during the Capitol breach likely 
served to foster connections, which 
may increase DVEs’ willingness, capa-
bility, and motivation to attack and 
undermine a government they view as 
illegitimate.’’ 
In other words, they all got to talk-
ing to each other. 
This bulletin by our own Intelligence 
Committee was also confirmed by con-
crete evidence. Rioters celebrated their 
roles in the January 6 attack on social 
media. They boasted about their suc-
cess in breaching the Capitol and forc-
ing Members of Congress and the Vice 
President to evacuate. Take, for exam-
ple, 
rightwing 
provocateur, 
Nick 
Fuentes. The day before the Capitol in-
surrection, Fuentes said this on his 
internet show: 
(Text of video presentation of 1–5- 
2021.) 
Mr. Fuentes. What can you and I do to a 
State legislator besides kill them? Although 
we should not kill them—I am not advising 
that. But, I mean, what else can you do, 
right? 
Fuentes was at the Capitol on Janu-
ary 6 and praised the insurrection on a 
live stream as ‘‘glorious’’ and ‘‘awe in-
spiring.’’ He later said: 
We forced a joint session of Congress and 
the vice president to evacuate because 
Trump supporters were banging down and 
then successfully burst through the doors. 
Fuentes 
was 
not 
the 
only 
provocateur to revel in the violence. 
According to Mike Dunn, a member of 
the Boogaloo Bois—an anti-govern-
ment 
movement 
whose 
adherents 
helped lead multiple groups in storm-
ing the Capitol—the Boogaloo Bois will 
be ‘‘working overtime’’ to capitalize on 
the January 6 riots and hope it will 
lead to more action. They said: 
Just know there is more to come. 
Proud Boys members were bragging 
about the attack on the Capitol. One 
post on the Proud Boys telegram chan-
nel said: 
People saw what we can do, they know 
what’s up, they want in. 
The leader of the Proud Boys himself 
sent the same message. Enrique Tarrio 
said the Proud Boys would be active 
during Biden’s Presidency. Tarrio stat-

You’re definitely going to see more of us. 
Extremist groups are also boasting 
that the attack on our Capitol is a 
boon for their recruitment efforts. 
Three Percent Security Force leader, 
Chris Hill, says he has been contacted 
by several people interested in joining 
since the insurrection. As one expert 
who focuses on domestic extremism, 
Jared Holt, explained: 
By all measurable effects this was for far- 
right extremists one of the most successful 
attacks that they’ve ever launched. . . . 
They’re talking about this as the first stab 
in a greater revolution. 
As indicated by Mr. Holt, their per-
ceived success has given them encour-
agement to continue and to escalate 
attacks. Intelligence agencies have 
also noted that these extremist groups 
will unfortunately be targeting vulner-
able minority communities in the U.S. 
A January 27, 2021, DHS bulletin 
warned ‘‘long-standing racial and eth-
nic tension’’ of the sort that led to a 
man killing 23 people at an El Paso 
Walmart in 2019 would continue to 
grow and motivate further attacks. 
The January 13 Joint Intelligence 
Bulletin report stated that in addition 
to the other types of violence listed, 
‘‘DVEs may be inspired to carry out 
more 
violence, 
including 
violence 
against racial, ethnic, and religious 
minorities and associated institutions, 
journalists, members of the LGBTQ+ 
community, and other targets common 
among some DVEs.’’ 
These prejudiced elements could be 
seen, visibly, in the crowd that at-
tacked the Capitol. 
Pictured here is Robert Packer. Rob-
ert Packer is an avowed White su-
premacist and Holocaust denier who 
proudly wore that sweatshirt, which 
states ‘‘Camp Auschwitz.’’ 
These prejudiced elements could also 
be heard from the crowds. As you have 
heard, the insurrectionists that at-
tacked the Capitol on January 6 hurled 
racial slurs, including at Black police 
officers. 
One officer described the trauma he 
experienced when the rioters seized the 
Capitol. He said: 
I’m a Black officer. There was a lot of rac-
ism that day. I was called racial slurs, and in 
the moment, I didn’t process this as trau-
matic. I was just trying to survive. I just 
wanted to get home, to see my daughter 
again. I couldn’t show weakness. I finally 
reached a safe place, surrounded by officers, 
I was able to cry. To let it out. To attempt 
to process it. 
These 
extremist 
groups 
were 
emboldened because President Trump 
told them repeatedly that their insur-
rectionist activities were the pinnacle 
of patriotism. Well, let today be the 
day that we reclaim the definition of 
patriotism. 
Impeachment is not to punish but to 
prevent. We are not here to punish 
Donald Trump. We are here to prevent 
the seeds of hatred that he planted 
from bearing any more fruit. As my 
colleagues showed, this is not the first 
time that President Trump inspired vi-
olence, but it must be the last time 
that he is given a platform to do so. 
This must be our wake-up call. We 
must condemn it because the threat is 
not over. 
President Trump refused to condemn 
this type of violence. Instead, over and 
over again, he has encouraged it. Our 
response must be different this time. 
We simply cannot sweep this under the 
rug. We must take a united stand, all 
of us, that this is not American. 
Think back to August 2017, when a 
young woman was murdered during a 
White supremacist rally in Charlottes-
ville, VA. Her name was Heather 
Heyer. Her mother’s name is Susan 
Bro. Ms. Bro has been a steadfast advo-
cate for her daughter’s memory. In a 
2018 interview, she expressed concern 
that people had rushed too quickly to 
reconciliation without accountability. 
(Text of video presentation of 8–11– 
2018.) 
Ms. BRO. If you rush to heal, if you rush to 
‘‘everybody 
grab 
each 
other 
and 
sing 
‘Kumbaya,’ ’’ we’ve accomplished nothing, 
and we will be right back here in a few years. 
‘‘We will be right back here in a few 
years.’’ Those were her words in 2018, 3 
years ago. Her daughter’s murderer, he 
was held to account, but our Nation did 
not impose any meaningful account-
ability on a President who, at the time, 
said that there were ‘‘very fine people 
on both sides.’’ 
And, now, where are we, 3 years 
later? I would argue we are not just 
back where we were. I would argue 
things are worse. In 2017, it was 
unfathomable to most of us to think 
that Charlottesville could happen, just 
as it was unfathomable to most of us 
that the Capitol could have been 
breached on January 6. Frankly, what 
unfathomable horrors await us if we do 
not stand up now and say: No, this is 
not America, and we will not just ex-
press condolences and denunciations. 
We won’t just close the book and try to 
move on. We will act to make sure this 
never happens again. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Representa-
tives CICILLINE and LIEU will now come 
to show the harm done and the damage 
done to Congress and our Democratic 
process. 
Mr. CICILLINE. 
Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Mr. Presi-
dent, distinguished Senators, you just 
heard from my colleague Manager 
DEGETTE how the conduct of Donald 
Trump 
dramatically 
increased 
the 
threats to our security and emboldened 
violent domestic extremists. 
I would like to now turn to the harm 
that was caused here, inside these 
walls, as a result of the conduct on 
January 6—the harm to us, to Con-
gress, to those who serve our country, 
and to the constitutional processes as 
the Trump mob tried to stop the elec-
tion certification process. 
The attack on January 6 is one of the 
bloodiest intrusions of the Capitol 
since the British invaded in the War of 
1812 and burned it to the ground. And 
you have heard in painstaking detail 
the President’s mob posed an imme-
diate and serious threat to the con-
tinuity and constitutional succession 
of the United States Government with 
the first, second, and third in line to 
the Presidency. The Vice President, 
the Speaker of the House, and the 
President pro tempore were all to-
gether and faced a common threat in 
the same location, and we have seen 
the first and the second were purposely 
targeted by these attackers. 
These were not idle threats. The 
mob, as you recall, chanted: 
Hang Mike Pence. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Hang Mike Pence.’’) 
The charging documents show that 
the rioters said they would have killed 
Vice President Pence and Speaker 
PELOSI had they found them. 
Dawn Bancroft and Diana Santos- 
Smith, two of the rioters charged in 
the attack, were caught on tape dis-
cussing the brutal violence that they 
hoped to inflict on Speaker PELOSI had 
she not been rushed out to safety. They 
said: 
We broke into the Capitol. . . . We got in-
side, we did our part. We were looking for 
Nancy to shoot her in the friggin’ brain but 
we didn’t find her. 
Senators, simply put, this mob was 
trying to overthrow our government, 
and it came perilously close to reach-
ing the first three people in line to the 
Presidency. 
It wasn’t just the Vice President and 
the Speaker; rioters were prepared to 
attack any Member of Congress they 
found. Thomas Edward Caldwell, Dono-
van Ray Crowl, and Jessica Marie Wat-
kins, three militia members, were also 
charged for their role in the attack. 
They discussed trapping us inside the 
underground tunnels. 
The indictment quotes social media 
chatter with Caldwell: 
All members are in the tunnels under [the] 
capitol seal them in. Turn on gas. 
All legislators are down in the Tunnels 3 
floors down. 
Do like we had to do when I was in the 
Corps, start tearing out floors, go from top 
to bottom. 
Never did any of us imagine that we 
or our colleagues would face mortal 
peril by a mob riled up by the Presi-
dent of the United States, the leader of 
the free world, but we did, all because 
Donald Trump could not accept his 
election defeat. 
Trump chose himself above the peo-
ple, above our institutions, above our 
democracy, above all of you. You 
know, we have heard Trump espouse 
for years now his ‘‘America First’’ pol-
icy. But his true North Star isn’t 
America’s well-being. It is not ‘‘Coun-
try First’’ like our dear departed col-
league John McCain. No, his directive 
is Trump first, no matter the cost, no 
matter the threat to our democracy. 
But each and every one of us in this 
room must agree on one thing: We can 
never allow the kind of violent attack 
that occurred on January 6 to ever hap-
pen again in this country. 
In the immediate aftermath, we 
heard many disturbing accounts from

many Members of Congress about what 
they experienced that day. Here are 
some of the reactions. 
Following the attack, Representative 
DUSTY
JOHNSON
expressed 
concerns 
that we had gotten to the point where 
so many of us had sown the seeds of 
anger and division. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. JOHNSON. (Inaudible), and there was 
some fear, to be sure, but overwhelmingly 
the emotion that I experienced was one of 
anger. I just could not believe that this was 
happening. I could not believe that we had 
gotten to this point where so many of us had 
sewn these seeds of anger and of division, 
and we had (inaudible) powder keg, and lit-
erally we were starting to see this powder 
keg light up, and it was—frankly, I was furi-
ous. 
Representative JASON
CROW
com-
pared the events of this day to his time 
in Afghanistan as an Army Ranger, 
something Senator REED knows some-
thing about. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. CROW. What I felt in the Capitol be-
hind us is something that I hadn’t felt since 
I was in Afghanistan when I was an Army 
Ranger. And to think that as a Member of 
Congress, in 2021, in the U.S. Capitol on the 
House floor, that I was preparing to fight my 
way out of the people’s House against a mob 
is just beyond troubling. 
Representative 
PAT
FALLON
was 
humbled by his experience on January 
6. He described the events as ‘‘surreal’’ 
as they unfolded here in the Capitol. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. FALLON. It was something that I just 
never thought—I just never thought I’d see 
this in our Nation’s Capitol and particularly 
in the House Chamber. It was surreal when it 
was unfolding. 
Well, you know, what was interesting was 
the bravery and courage of some of my fel-
low Members. When we got to a point where 
the mob was banging on the doors, and then 
all that kept them from breaching that—the 
Chamber itself was the doors and then some 
furniture that we had moved (inaudible) Cap-
itol Police. And they needed to be aug-
mented, and so Tony Gonzales, the new Rep-
resentative from Texas, and Ronny Jackson 
and Troy Nehls and Markwayne Mullin 
stepped in, and we broke off furniture. Some 
of the (inaudible) big giant poles, wooden 
poles, and we turned them upside down, and 
we were ready to actually have to street 
fight in the House Chamber. It was unbeliev-
able. 
Many Members that day wondered if 
they would ever see their families 
again as the rioters breached the Cap-
itol and they were outnumbered and 
trapped inside. They were calling loved 
ones to say goodbye. Representative 
DAN KILDEE was one of them. Listen to 
how he described the impact of the riot 
on him. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. KILDEE. I was laying on the floor try-
ing to, you know, (inaudible) myself sort of 
(inaudible). And, you know, (inaudible) we 
were concerned that this mob might come in 
and that might (inaudible) identify Members 
of Congress. 
I called my wife, and, you know, it wasn’t 
till I heard her voice that I thought, wow, 
this is like one of those calls you hear about. 
While most coverage focused on the 
extreme danger posed to Members and 
the Capitol Police, who were targets of 
this attack, there were lots of other 
people in the Capitol working on Janu-
ary 6 as well, from personal aides to 
floor employees, cleaning staff, food 
service workers. We can’t forget all the 
people who were in harm’s way that 
day. 
These 
employees 
experienced 
trauma. Some cowered, hiding places 
just a few feet away from where this 
rabid crowd had assembled. Many were 
just kids, 20-somethings who came here 
to work because they believed in their 
country and they believed in working 
to make it better. Others were dedi-
cated food service workers, all working 
incredibly hard to make sure that we 
can come here to do our job. These 
workers are the lifeblood of the legisla-
tive branch. They deserve better. 
You already heard from Speaker 
PELOSI’s staff—staff that was hiding 
under the conference table, cowering in 
the 
dark, 
making 
sure 
that 
the 
attackers couldn’t hear them. I would 
like to share with you what some other 
staffers went through. Listen as two 
staffers recall what they experienced 
that day. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Unidentified Speaker. But then we were 
seeing on Twitter and iPhones and hearing 
from some of the police officers on the floor 
that the building had been breached, you 
know. ‘‘Building breached’’—those are two 
words I had never heard. 
Unidentified Speaker. That was particu-
larly stressful, being in a room close to 
where things were happening and not really 
knowing what was happening and seeing it 
come in live and getting texts from people, 
you know, ‘‘Are you OK?’’ And, truthfully, I 
didn’t know what was happening. I heard: 
‘‘Shots fired. Shots fired. Shots fired. Show 
me your hands. Show me your hands.’’ Then 
I did not know if they were right outside, if 
there were lots of people with weapons, if 
there were one shooter, if they had—you 
know, I didn’t know what it looked like. I 
just knew that there were shots fired outside 
of the House Chamber. 
According to reports, one Republican 
Senate staffer whose office was not far 
from the floor ‘‘took a steel rod and 
barricaded his door as the rioters 
banged on his door trying to break in.’’ 
The New York Times also reported 
that a senior Black staffer was under 
lockdown for 6 hours during the insur-
rection and was so disturbed about 
these events, she quit her job. 
Another staffer who was on the floor 
of the House that day described that 
what happened on January 6 still 
echoes in his mind. Listen to him de-
scribe the moments just before this in-
delible image. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Unidentified Speaker. I heard blasts, and I 
could see the window panes on the House 
main door sort of pop, and I figured that, you 
know, obviously I knew they were at the 
door, and they figured out a way to break 
the glass. And the last thing I remember be-
fore I walked off the floor was several police 
officers had drawn their guns and had their 
guns trained on the door. 
Clearly, it was—I didn’t think there was 
anything else I could do, and I didn’t want to 
be there for what was about to occur. So I 
got to the top of the stairs. The stairway was 
pretty packed, and right about that point, I 
don’t know whether it was a police officer or 
somebody else said, ‘‘They are right behind 
us. Run.’’ 
For me, what I keep thinking about—and, 
again, there isn’t a day that has gone by 
since January 6 that at some point in the 
day I haven’t kind of gone back and picked 
up some little thing, but the sound of those 
window panes popping, I won’t forget that 
sound. 
‘‘I won’t forget that sound.’’ How 
long will the sound of window panes 
breaking haunt this staffer? And he 
isn’t alone. There are countless people 
still living with the trauma of what 
happened that day. This includes, by 
the way, another group of people who 
were with us in the Capitol that day, 
and that is the press. They were in dan-
ger, particularly after years of being 
derided by President Trump as fake 
news. 
Kristin Wilson, a reporter for CNN, 
recently tweeted about her experience. 
She said: 
I have 14 people on my team. We were scat-
tered everywhere. Two of them were on 
crutches and couldn’t have run if they had 
to. They had to anyway. 
One was trapped in the House Chamber and 
had to crawl out to hide. 
Four of us barricaded ourselves in a room 
off the Senate Chamber. Every bang on the 
door of them trying to come through I can 
still hear in my head. 
The janitorial and custodial staff in 
the Capitol, the people who day after 
day tend to our home away from home, 
were also traumatized, but we don’t 
talk about them and the harm they 
suffered often enough. 
One janitorial worker recounts how 
he was so scared, he had to hide in the 
closet during the attack. He said: 
I was all by myself. I didn’t know what was 
going on. 
Another employee, a mother of three, 
said: 
The insurrection shattered all my sense of 
security at work. 
An employee of the Capitol said: 
I hope nothing else happens because these 
people were talking about killing us, killing 
Federal employees, killing the police. 
Another employee was afraid to work 
on Inauguration Day, saying: 
I honestly fear for my life. I’ve got two 
children at home. 
For many of the Black and Brown 
staff, the trauma was made worse by 
the many painful symbols of hate that 
were on full display that day. Insurrec-
tionists waved Confederate flags and 
hurled the most disgusting racial slurs 
at dedicated Capitol workers. 
Then, after all of that, these same 
workers, many of them people of color, 
were forced to clean up the mess left by 
mobs of White nationalists. One mem-
ber of the janitorial staff reflected how 
terrible he felt when he had to clean up 
feces that had been smeared on the 
wall, blood of the rioter who had died, 
broken glass, and other objects strewn 
all over the floor. He said: 
I felt bad. I felt degraded. 
Let’s also not forget that this violent 
attack happened in the middle of a

global pandemic. Social distancing was 
impossible because we were hiding for 
our lives in cramped quarters for long 
periods of time. Since January 6, at 
least seven Members who hid with 
other Members of Congress have tested 
positive for COVID–19. 
At least 38 Capitol Police officers 
have either tested positive or been ex-
posed, and nearly 200 National Guard 
troops, who were deployed to our Na-
tion’s Capital to provide all of us pro-
tection, have tested positive. The Cap-
itol Police and the National Guard 
came here to keep us safe, to serve. 
They put their lives in danger. They 
deserve better than this. We all did. 
That brings me to the next harm. 
Now, all of us in this room made it out 
alive, but not everyone was so lucky. 
Three law enforcement officers trag-
ically lost their lives as a result of the 
riot on January 6. These officers were 
Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, 
Capitol 
Police 
Officer 
Howard 
Liebengood, and Metropolitan Police 
Officer Jeffrey Smith. All honorably 
served to protect and defend. 
My colleague Mr. SWALWELL told you 
about Officer Sicknick, who was a 42- 
year-old military veteran who dedi-
cated his entire life to public service. 
On January 6, he fought a mob of riot-
ers as they streamed into the Capitol 
and ultimately lost his life protecting 
us. 
Officer Liebengood was a 15-year vet-
eran of the Capitol Police. His father 
served as Sergeant at Arms here in the 
Senate, and Officer Liebengood fol-
lowed his extraordinary example of 
public service. 
Officer Smith served 12 years with 
the Metropolitan Police Department. 
He heeded the call of January 6 by 
coming to stand with Capitol Police to 
help secure our democracy. 
Earlier, 
my 
colleague 
Manager 
SWALWELL showed you terrible videos 
of the police being physically abused 
and injured. You remember what hap-
pened to Officer Fanone and Officer 
Hodges of the MPD, but there were 
scores of other officers whose names we 
don’t know who were also brutalized 
that day. Injuries to the U.S. Capitol 
Police and the Metropolitan Police De-
partment were concussions, irritated 
lungs, and serious injuries caused by 
repeated blows from bats, poles, and 
clubs. 
Capitol Police officers also sustained 
injuries that will be with them for the 
rest of their lives. One officer lost the 
tip of a right index finger. 
In a statement issued on January 7, 
the chairman of the Capitol Police Of-
ficers’ Union said: 
I have officers who were not issued helmets 
prior to the attack who have sustained brain 
injuries. One officer has two cracked ribs and 
two smashed spinal discs. One officer is 
going to lose his eye, and another was 
stabbed with a metal fence stake. 
In total, at least 81 members of Cap-
itol Police and of 65 members of the 
Metropolitan Police Department were 
injured during the attack on January 6. 
Former Capitol Police Chief Sund de-
scribed the insurrection as violent, un-
like anything he had seen in his 30-year 
career in law enforcement. 
DC Police Chief Robert J. Contee III, 
who had spoken with an officer who 
had been beaten and injured with a 
stun gun, said: 
I’ve talked to officers who have done two 
tours of Iraq who said this was scarier to 
them than their time in combat. 
Of course, the physical violence is 
not the only thing that will have a 
lasting effect on our brave sworn offi-
cers. Trump’s mob verbally denigrated 
their patriotism, questioned their loy-
alty, and yelled racial slurs. They 
called them ‘‘traitors,’’ ‘‘Nazis,’’ ‘‘un- 
American’’ for protecting us. 
For example, in our next clip, a ri-
oter wearing a hunting jacket accosts a 
police officer. 
(Text of video presentation:) 
Unidentified Speaker. Are you an Amer-
ican? Act like one. (Inaudible.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Don’t yell at them. 
Unidentified Speaker. You have no idea 
what the fuck you’re doing. 
Unidentified Speaker. Now once again (in-
audible). Not one idea. 
Unidentified Speaker. Stand up for Amer-
ica. Goddamn it. 
Unidentified Speaker. Get the fuck out of 
here. 
Unidentified Speaker. Don’t talk to me, 
motherfucker. 
Unidentified Speaker. No, they work for 
us. Fuck them. 
Listen to how the Trump mob talked 
to these officers. You heard that with 
your own ears. 
(Text of video presentation:) 
Unidentified Speaker. Fuck you. Fuck you, 
bitch. Fuck you. Fucking traitors. You are 
fucking. 
Unidentified Speaker. You call me a 
motherfucker. 
Unidentified Speaker. You are a fucking 
traitor to your country. You are a fucking 
traitor. 
Unidentified Speaker. Yeah, traitor. 
Unidentified Speaker. Fucking call me a 
(inaudible). 
‘‘F’ing traitor’’—so much for backing the 
blue. 
Just a couple more examples. 
(Text of video presentation:) 
Unidentified Speaker. Hand over your pay-
check. Fuck you guys. You can’t even call 
yourself American. You broke your fucking 
oath today. 1776, bitch. 
Unidentified Speaker. (Inaudible) pepper 
spray, officers. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Traitor.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Go home.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Traitor.’’) 
They called law enforcement officers 
‘‘traitors.’’ You have to wonder, who 
are these rioters sworn to? To whom do 
they believe the police owe their loy-
alty? To the people? To the Constitu-
tion? To our democracy? Or to Donald 
Trump? 
Even those who were not outwardly 
injured, the mental toll has been sig-
nificant. Several Capitol Police officers 
have reportedly threatened self-harm 
in the days following the riot. And in 
one case, an officer voluntarily turned 
in her gun because she was afraid of 
what might happen. 
Black police officers were also met 
with racist vitriol. You heard Lead 
Manager RASKIN reference a Black po-
lice 
officer 
who 
was 
weary 
from 
racialized violence that he had experi-
enced that day, saying: 
Tears just started streaming down my 
face. I said, ‘‘what the eff, man? Is this 
America?’’ 
‘‘Is this America?’’ Lead Manager 
RASKIN asked: ‘‘Is this America?’’ What 
is your answer to that question? Is this 
OK? If not, what are we going to do 
about it? 
These people matter—these matter 
who risked their lives for us. So I ask 
you, respectfully, to consider them— 
the police officers, the staff of this 
building—when you cast your vote. 
These people are in deep pain because 
they showed up here to serve, to serve 
the American people, to serve their 
government, to serve all of us. And I 
ask each of you when you cast your 
vote to remember them and honor 
them and act in service of them, as 
they deserve. 
I also want to recognize that four in-
dividuals—four 
insurrectionist—also 
lost their lives during the attack. 
These people were led here by the 
words and actions of an individual who 
made them believe that they were pa-
triots. 
The loss of human life is, of course, 
the most consequential, but that was 
not the only damage brought that day. 
The Trump mob also damaged this 
building. They defiled some of the most 
sacred places: Statuary Hall, the Ro-
tunda, where some of America’s great-
est champions, Presidents, Supreme 
Court Justices, civil rights heroes, and 
other defenders are honored after their 
death. Trump’s violent mob had little 
respect for this place. 
This video shows the wreckage left in 
the Senate Parliamentarian’s office by 
the insurrectionists. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
A bust of President Zachary Taylor 
was smeared with what appeared to be 
blood. An empty picture frame presum-
ably robbed of its content was found on 
the floor. And videos of the insurrec-
tion captured one man stealing a 
framed photo, another one tearing a 
scroll from the wall and ripping it up 
and throwing those pieces on the floor. 
A sign paying tribute to John Lewis 
was also shamefully destroyed, and 
only a broken piece of the memorial 
was found on the ground next to a 
trash can. The photo of Mr. Lewis was 
gone. 
The damage done to this building is a 
stain on all of us and on the dignity of 
our democracy. 
The attack we saw had a purpose: 
Stop the certification. Stop our demo-
cratic process. Fortunately, they did 
not prevail. 
Newspapers across America on Janu-
ary 21, the day after the inauguration, 
proclaimed: 
Democracy has prevailed. 
President-Elect Biden said that in his 
inauguration speech. The headline was

in so many places because the world’s 
oldest constitutional democracy and 
the principles underlying it had been 
attacked and challenged. 
This wasn’t just an attack on the 
Capitol Building and the dedicated peo-
ple inside. It was an attack on what we 
were elected to preserve—our democ-
racy. 
This attack on our elections, on the 
peaceful transfer of power from one 
President to the next didn’t even hap-
pen during the Civil War. But it did 
just happen because of the cold, cal-
culated, and conspiratorial acts of our 
former President Donald J. Trump. 
We showed you that the insurrection-
ists were deliberate, that they came 
looking for Vice President Pence and 
Speaker PELOSI, ready to kill. When 
President Trump incited a lawless mob 
to attack our process, he was attacking 
our democracy. He was trying to be-
come King and rule over us, against 
the will of the people and the valid re-
sults of the election. 
For the first time ever in our history, 
a sitting President actively instigated 
his supporters to violently disrupt the 
process that provides for the peaceful 
transfer of power from one President to 
the next. 
Think about that for a moment. 
What if President Trump had been suc-
cessful? What if he had succeeded in 
overturning the will of the people and 
our 
constitutional 
processes? 
Who 
among us is willing to risk that out-
come by letting Trump’s constitutional 
crimes go unanswered? 
The Founders included impeachment 
in our Constitution, not as a punish-
ment but to prevent. We have to pre-
vent every President—today, tomor-
row, or anytime in the future—from be-
lieving that this conduct is acceptable. 
Today, we have to stand up for our 
democracy and ensure we remain a 
country governed by the people, for the 
people by telling Donald Trump and 
people all across this country and all 
across the world that his crimes will 
not and cannot stand. 
RECESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the House stand in recess for

Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the House stand in recess for 
15 minutes—the Senate, the Senate. 
There being no objection, at 2:10 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 2:45 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the President 
pro tempore. 
MANAGERS’ PRESENTATION—CONTINUED 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senate will come to order. 
Manager RASKIN. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
Mr. CASTRO will now return to ad-
dress the harm visited upon America’s 
national security by these events and 
the damage to our international rep-
utation. 
Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. My 
colleagues discussed with you the 
many harms to our Nation as a result 
of President Trump’s conduct. Now I 
would like to spend some time talking 
about the harm to our national secu-
rity and our standing in the world. 
On January 6, when President Trump 
incited a mob to march to the Capitol, 
he led them to a building that houses 
some of our Nation’s most sensitive in-
formation. Consider who was part of 
that mob. Some of the individuals were 
on the FBI watch list. The past behav-
ior of some individuals led here by 
President Trump so alarmed investiga-
tors that their names had been added 
to the national Terrorist Screening 
Database, and at least one of the insur-
rectionists may have intended to steal 
information and give it to a foreign ad-
versary. 
According to charging documents, 
Riley Williams allegedly helped steal a 
laptop from Speaker PELOSI’s office to 
‘‘send the computer device to a friend 
in Russia, who then planned to sell the 
device to SVR, Russia’s foreign intel-
ligence service.’’ 
While we can’t be certain if or how 
many foreign spies infiltrated the 
crowd or at least coordinated with 
those who did, we can be sure that any 
enemy who wanted access to our se-
crets would have wanted to be part of 
that mob inside these halls. 
The point is this: Many of the insur-
rectionists that President Trump in-
cited to invade this Chamber were dan-
gerous—people on the FBI watch list, 
violent extremists, White suprema-
cists. And these insurrectionists in-
cited by President Trump threatened 
our national security. Stealing laptops, 
again, from Speaker PELOSI’s office; 
taking documents from Leader MCCON-
NELL’s desk; snapping photographs, as 
you saw in the videos earlier, in sen-
sitive areas; ransacking your offices; 
rifling through your desks. 
The President of the United States, 
the Commander in Chief, knew the risk 
of anyone reaching the Capitol. He 
swore an oath to preserve, protect, and 
defend this country. And yet, he in-
cited them here to break into the Cap-
itol. 
Senators, as you all know, we have 
spent trillions of dollars building the 
strongest military in the world and bil-
lions of dollars on the most sophisti-
cated weaponry on the planet to pre-
vent the kind of attack that occurred 
at this Capitol on January 6. Here is 
what the insurrectionists incited by 
President Trump did. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Hey, let’s take a 
seat, people. Let’s take a seat. 
Unidentified 
Speaker. 
You 
be 
Nancy 
Pelosi. 
Unidentified Speaker. Let’s vote on some 
shit. 
Unidentified Speaker. Oh, my God. We did 
this shit. We took this shit. 
Unidentified Speaker. She’s in the House. 
The House is on the other side. 
Unidentified Speaker. I want to just get a 
snap of that. 
Unidentified Speaker. Yeah, take a pic-
ture. 
In many ways, this room is sacred 
and so are the traditions that it rep-
resents. They have been carried on for 
centuries. 
Congress has declared war 11 times 
on this floor, including entering World 
War II—where Congress passed the 
Civil Rights Act and expanded the 
right to vote to ensure that no matter 
your race or your gender, you have a 
voice in our Nation. 
This floor is where history has been 
made. And now, our intelligence agen-
cies and law enforcement agencies have 
the burden to figure out exactly what 
was stolen, taken, ransacked, and com-
promised. 
As acting U.S. Attorney Michael 
Sherwin explained, ‘‘Materials were 
stolen, and we have to identify what 
was done, mitigate that, and it could 
have potential national security equi-
ties.’’ 
These investigations are necessary 
now because of the actions of President 
Trump. And it wasn’t just the people 
that he led here the intelligence agen-
cies have to look into, it is also what 
they took and what they gathered, and 
it was the very fact that this building, 
with so much sensitive information 
and some classified information, that 
this Capitol was breached. 
Think about it. Every foreign adver-
sary considering attacking this build-
ing got to watch a dress rehearsal, and 
they saw that this Capitol could be 
overtaken. 
As Elizabeth Neumann, a former 
Trump administration official, stated, 
‘‘[Y]ou have terrorists who would love 
to destroy the Capitol. They just saw 
how easy it was to penetrate. We just 
exposed a huge vulnerability.’’ 
And it is not just the Capitol, this at-
tack has implications for all govern-
ment buildings. 
Senator RUBIO made this point well. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. RUBIO. If you’re a terrorist right now 
and you’re sitting out there watching this, 
you’re saying to yourself, hey, it’s not that 
hard to get into the Capitol. Maybe it’s not 
hard to get into the White House or the Su-
preme Court building or somewhere else. 
Our government, our intelligence 
agencies, and our law enforcement 
have implemented additional safety 
measures since the attack on January 
6, but while we secure this physical 
space, what message will we send the 
rest of the world? 
We already know what message our 
adversaries took from January 6. This 
is how some of them responded after 
the attack. 
For America’s adversaries, there was 
no greater proof of the fallibility of 
Western democracy than the sight of 
the U.S. Capitol shrouded in smoke and 
besieged by a mob whipped up by their 
unwillingly outgoing president. 
To make matters worse, our adver-
saries are even using the events of Jan-
uary 6 not only to denigrate America 
but to justify their own anti-demo-
cratic behavior, calling America hypo-
critical.

February 11, 2021 
Here is what the Chinese Government 
is saying. The spokesperson for China’s 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the 
Capitol riots ‘‘should spark ‘deep re-
flection’ among U.S. lawmakers re-
garding how they discuss the pro-de-
mocracy movement in Hong Kong, sug-
gesting that the U.S. is hypocritical in 
denouncing Beijing’s crackdown in the 
city while it struggles with its own un-
rest at home.’’ 
The Global Times, an outlet affili-
ated with the Chinese Communist 
Party, even tweeted a series of side-by- 
side photos of two events: the siege of 
the U.S. Capitol and a July 2019 inci-
dent in which pro-democracy pro-
testers in Hong Kong broke into the 
city’s Legislative Council building. 
Think about that. President Trump 
gave the Chinese Government an open-
ing to create a false equivalency be-
tween Hongkongers protesting for de-
mocracy and violent insurrections try-
ing to overthrow it. 
As Representative GALLAGHER
de-
scribed in realtime: 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. GALLAGHER. If we don’t think other 
countries around the world are watching this 
happen right now, if we don’t think the Chi-
nese Communist Party is sitting back and 
laughing, then we’re deluding ourselves. So 
call it off, Mr. President. We need you to call 
this off. 
Russia has also seized on this violent 
attack against our government, decry-
ing that democracy is ‘‘over.’’ The 
chairman of the Russian upper house of 
Parliament’s 
International 
Affairs 
Committee said: 
The celebration of democracy is over. This 
is, alas, actually the bottom. I say this with-
out a hint of gloating. America is no longer 
charting the course, and therefore has lost 
all its rights to set it. And especially to im-
pose it on others. 
They are using President Trump’s in-
citement of an insurrection to declare 
that democracy is over. 
In Iran, the Supreme Leader is using 
President Trump’s incitement of an in-
surrection to mock America. He said of 
the situation in the United States: 
This is their democracy and human rights, 
this is their election scandal, these are their 
values. These values are being mocked by 
the whole world. Even their friends are 
laughing at them. 
These statements are serious and 
pervasive. According to a joint threat 
assessment bulletin from the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, the FBI, 
and eight other law enforcement enti-
ties, ‘‘Since the incident at the U.S. 
Capitol on 6 January, Russian, Iranian, 
and Chinese influence actors have 
seized the opportunity to amplify nar-
ratives in furtherance of their policy 
interest amid the presidential transi-
tion.’’ 
We cannot let them use what hap-
pened on January 6 to define us, who 
we are, and what we stand for. We get 
to define ourselves by how we respond 
to the attack of January 6. 
Some might be tempted to say and 
point out that our adversaries are al-
ways going to be critical of the United 
States. But following the insurrection 
on January 6, even our allies are speak-
ing up. Canadian Prime Minister Jus-
tin Trudeau said: 
What we witnessed was an assault on de-
mocracy by violent rioters, incited by the 
current president and other politicians. As 
shocking, deeply disturbing and frankly sad-
dening as that event remains—we have also 
seen this week that democracy is resilient in 
America, our closest ally and neighbor. 
The German Foreign Minister said: 
This closing of ranks begins with holding 
those accountable who are responsible for 
such escalations. That includes the violent 
rioters and also includes their instigators. 
The world is watching and wondering 
whether we are who we say we are be-
cause 
when 
other 
countries 
have 
known chaos, our Constitution has 
helped keep order in America. This is 
why we have a Constitution. We must 
stand up for the rule of law because the 
rule of law doesn’t just stand up by 
itself. 
After the insurrection, my colleagues 
on the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, the chairman and the ranking 
member, issued a bipartisan statement 
that said: 
America has always been a beacon of free-
dom to the world; proof that free and fair 
elections are achievable, and that democracy 
works. But what happened at the Capitol 
today has scarred our reputation and has 
damaged our standing in the world. 
Today’s 
violence—an 
inevitable 
result 
when leaders in positions of power misled the 
public—will certainly empower dictators and 
damage struggling democracies. 
And that is true. For generations, the 
United States has been a North Star in 
the world for freedom, democracy, and 
human rights because America is not 
only a nation for many, it is also an 
idea. It is the light that gives hope to 
people struggling for democracy in 
autocratic regimes, the light that in-
spires people fighting across the world 
for fundamental human rights, and the 
light that inspires us to believe in 
something larger than ourselves. 
This trial is an opportunity to re-
spond and to send a message back to 
the world. 
I say this as somebody who loves my 
country, our country, just as all of you 
do. There is a lot of courage in this 
room, a lot of courage that has been 
demonstrated in the lives of the people 
in this room. Some folks have stood up 
for the civil rights of fellow Americans 
and risked their careers and their rep-
utations, their livelihoods and their 
safety in standing up for civil rights. 
Many Members of Congress have risked 
their lives in service to our country, in 
uniform: in fighting in the jungles of 
Vietnam, in patrolling the mountains 
of Afghanistan. You served our country 
because you were willing to sacrifice to 
defend our Nation as we know it and as 
the world knows it. Although most of 
you have traded in your uniforms for 
public service, your country needs you 
one more time. 
The world watched President Trump 
tell his big lie. The world watched his 
supporters come to Washington at his 
invitation, and the world watched as he 
told his supporters to march here to 
the Capitol. President Trump, our 
Commander in Chief at the time, failed 
to take any action to defend us as he 
utterly failed in his duty to preserve, 
protect, and defend. Now the world is 
watching us, wondering whether our 
constitutional Republic is going to re-
spond the way it should, the way it is 
supposed to—whether the rule of law 
will prevail over mob rule. The answer 
to that question has consequences far 
beyond our own borders. Think of the 
consequences to our diplomats and ne-
gotiators as they sit at tables around 
the world to enforce our agenda on 
trade, the economy, and human rights. 
To fail to convict a President of the 
United States who incited a deadly in-
surrection, who acted in concert with a 
violent mob, who interfered with the 
certification of the electoral college 
votes, who abdicated his duty as Com-
mander in Chief, would be to forfeit the 
power of our example as a North Star 
for freedom, democracy, human rights, 
and most of all, the rule of law. To con-
vict Donald Trump would mean that 
America stands for the rule of law no 
matter who violates it. Let us show the 
world that January 6 was not America, 
and let us remind the world that we are 
truly their North Star. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Representa-
tive NEGUSE and I will now address the 
First Amendment argument that is 
being offered by President Trump’s 
lawyers to try to excuse his incitement 
to this insurrection. Mr. NEGUSE will 
begin. 
Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. Presi-
dent, 
distinguished 
Senators, 
good 
afternoon. 
You have heard over the course of 
the last several days that President 
Trump incited an insurrection, but, as 
Lead Manager RASKIN mentioned, as 
we prepare to close, we would be remiss 
if we didn’t just briefly address, appar-
ently, the principal defense the Presi-
dent will offer to excuse his conduct, 
and that is this notion that he can’t be 
held accountable for what happened on 
January 6 because his actions are 
somehow 
protected 
by 
the 
First 
Amendment. 
Now, let’s stop for a moment and try 
to really understand the argument 
they are making. According to Presi-
dent Trump, everything he did—every-
thing we showed you that he did—was 
perfectly OK for him to do and for a fu-
ture President to do again, and the 
Constitution, apparently, in their view, 
forbids you from doing anything to 
stop it. That can’t be right. It can’t be, 
and it isn’t right. 
Their argument is meant as a dis-
traction. They are concerned not with 
the facts that actually occurred, the 
facts that we have proven, but with an 
alternative set of facts where President 
Trump did nothing but deliver a con-
troversial speech at a rally. Of course, 
that is not what we have charged in the 
Article of Impeachment, and it is not 
what happened.

You will hear from my colleague 
Lead Manager RASKIN
of the many 
myriad reasons why this argument 
that they make is wrong on the law 
completely, not just around the edges. 
They make major, fundamental mis-
takes of constitutional law, the kind 
that Lead Manager RASKIN tells me 
wouldn’t cut it in his first-year law 
course, which, of course, he certainly 
would know, as he has taught this sub-
ject for decades. 
That explains why so many lawyers 
who have dedicated their lives to pro-
tecting free speech, including many of 
the Nation’s most prominent conserv-
ative free speech lawyers, have de-
scribed 
President 
Trump’s 
First 
Amendment claims as ‘‘legally frivo-
lous.’’ Here is another quote from a re-
cent letter from prominent free speech 
lawyers: 
The First Amendment is no bar to the Sen-
ate convicting former President Trump and 
disqualifying him from holding future office. 
Their argument is wrong on the 
facts, wrong on the law, and would flip 
the Constitution upside down. 
Let’s start with the facts because, as 
you will see, his free speech claim de-
pends on an account of what he did, of 
why we are here, that has no basis in 
the evidence. To hear his lawyers tell 
it, he was just some guy at a rally, ex-
pressing 
unpopular 
opinions. 
They 
would have you believe that this whole 
impeachment is because he said things 
that one may disagree with. Really? 
Make no mistake, they will do any-
thing to avoid talking about the facts 
of this case. That, I can assure you. In-
stead, we expect they will talk about a 
lot of other speeches, including some 
given by Democratic officials, and they 
will insist, with indignation, that the 
First Amendment protects all of this 
as though it were exactly the same. 
We trust you to know the difference 
because you have seen the evidence 
that we have seen. You have seen, as 
we have proven over the last 3 days, 
that 
his 
arguments 
completely 
misdescribe the reality of what hap-
pened on January 6. They leave out ev-
erything that matters about why we 
are here and what he did. 
President Trump wasn’t just some 
guy with political opinions who showed 
up at a rally on January 6 and deliv-
ered controversial remarks. He was the 
President of the United States, and he 
had spent months—months—using the 
unique power of that office, of his bully 
pulpit, to spread that big lie that the 
election had been stolen; to convince 
his followers to stop the steal; to as-
semble just blocks away from here on 
January 6 at the very moment that we 
were meeting to count the electoral 
college votes, where he knew—where it 
had been widely reported—that they 
were primed and eager and ready for vi-
olence at his signal. Then, standing in 
the middle of that explosive situation, 
in that powder keg that he had created 
over the course of months, before a 
crowd filled with people who were 
poised for violence at his signal, he 
struck a match, and he aimed it 
straight at this building, at us. 
You have seen all of that evidence. 
There is no denying it. That is why the 
House impeached him. That is why he 
is on trial. No President, no matter the 
politics or the politics of the fol-
lowers—conservative, liberal, or any-
thing else—can do what President 
Trump did because this isn’t about pol-
itics; it is about his refusal to accept 
the outcome of the election and his de-
cision to incite an insurrection. There 
is no serious argument that the First 
Amendment protects that, and it would 
be extraordinarily dangerous for the 
United States Senate to conclude oth-
erwise, to tell future Presidents that 
they can do exactly what President 
Trump did and get away with it, to set 
the precedent that this is acceptable, 
that now this is a constitutionally pro-
tected way to respond to losing an elec-
tion. 
You will notice something that Lead 
Manager RASKIN and I noticed, which is 
that, by all accounts, it doesn’t appear 
that President Trump’s lawyers dis-
agree. I mean, they don’t insist that if 
the facts we have charged, the facts 
that we have proven, the facts sup-
ported by overwhelming evidence are 
true, as, of course, you now know they 
are, that there is nothing you can do. 
They are not arguing that it is OK for 
a person to incite a mob to violence— 
at least I don’t think they are arguing 
that. Instead, what they are doing is 
offering a radically different version of 
what happened that day, totally incon-
sistent with the evidence. Then they 
insist that if that fictional version of 
events, if that alternate reality were 
true, well then he may be protected by 
the First Amendment. 
That is their argument, but you are 
here to adjudicate real evidence, real 
facts, not hypothetical ones, and for 
that reason alone, you should reject 
their argument because it has been ad-
vanced to defend a situation that bears 
no resemblance to the actual facts of 
this case. 
With that, I want to turn it over to 
my colleague Lead Manager RASKIN to 
address the many legal flaws, as I men-
tioned, in President Trump’s position. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. NEGUSE 
has explained why President Trump’s 
last-ditch First Amendment argument 
has got nothing to do with the actual 
facts of the case. He has been im-
peached for inciting a violent insurrec-
tion against the government. Inciting a 
violent insurrection is not protected by 
free speech. There is no First Amend-
ment defense to impeachment for high 
crimes and misdemeanors. The idea 
itself is absurd. 
The whole First Amendment smoke-
screen is a completely irrelevant dis-
traction from the standard of high 
crimes and misdemeanors governing a 
President who has violated his oath of 
office. Yet President Trump, we know, 
has a good way of treating up as down 
and wrong as right. He tried to pull off 
the biggest election fraud in American 
history by overturning the results of 
the 2020 election even as he insisted 
that his own fraud was, in fact, an ef-
fort to stop the steal, to stop a fraud— 
a vast conspiracy that he blamed on 
local and State officials of both polit-
ical parties, the media, election offi-
cials, the judiciary—Federal, State— 
and Members of Congress. Anybody 
who wouldn’t go along with him was 
part of the conspiracy. 
He violated his oath of office by in-
citing mob violence to prevent Con-
gress from counting electoral college 
votes as we were assigned to do by the 
12th Amendment and the Electoral 
Count Act. He even attacked Vice 
President Pence at a rally for violating 
his oath of office and going along with 
an egregious assault on democracy. 
Now he argues that the Congress is 
violating his free speech rights when it 
was Donald Trump who incited an in-
surrection as an attack against us, 
that halted speech and debate on the 
floor of the House and Senate during 
the peaceful transfer of power, and that 
imperiled the very constitutional order 
that protects freedom of speech in the 
first place along with all of our other 
fundamental rights. 
As a matter of law, it is a matter of 
logic. President Trump’s brazen at-
tempt to invoke the First Amendment 
now won’t hold up in any way. 
The basic flaw, of course, is that it 
completely ignores the fact that he was 
the President of the United States—a 
public official. He swears an oath as 
President that nobody else swears. In 
exchange, he is given greater powers 
than anyone else in the entire coun-
try—maybe on Earth. He or she prom-
ises to preserve, protect, and defend 
the Constitution of the United States 
and our government institutions and 
our people. 
And, as we all know, the power we 
entrust to people in public office, in 
government 
office—especially, 
our 
Presidents—comes with special obliga-
tions to uphold the laws and the integ-
rity of our Republic, and we all support 
that. 
Now, what if a President publicly— 
say a President publicly and on a daily 
basis advocated replacing the Constitu-
tion with a totalitarian form of govern-
ment and urged States to secede from 
the Union and swore an oath of loyalty 
to a foreign leader or a foreign govern-
ment. 
Well, 
as 
a 
private 
citizen, 
you 
couldn’t do anything about people 
using those words to advocate totali-
tarianism, to advocate secession from 
the Union, to swear an oath of personal 
loyalty to a foreign leader or foreign 
government or country. You couldn’t. 
That is totally protected. If you tried 
to prosecute somebody for that, as a 
prosecutor, you would lose. 
But it is simply inconceivable, un-
thinkable that a President could do 
any of these things—get up and swear 
an oath to foreign governments or 
leaders, advocate totalitarianism, ad-
vocate secession, and not be impeached

for it. It is just unthinkable that that 
could happen. 
Would 
that 
violate 
their 
First 
Amendment rights? 
The opposite view pressed here by 
President Trump’s counsel would leave 
the Nation powerless to respond to a 
President who would use his un-
matched power, privilege, and prestige 
of his or her office—the famous bully 
pulpit—in ways that risk the ruin of 
the Republic, all for his or her own am-
bition and corruption and lust for 
power. 
Everyone should be clear: There is 
nothing remotely exotic about what we 
are saying. It should be common sense 
to everybody—common sense—about 
this understanding of the First Amend-
ment as it applies to public servants— 
cops, firefighters, teachers, everybody 
across the land. 
My daughter, who I mentioned early 
in the trial, she is a teacher in a public 
school. The courts have said teachers 
teach, but if they go off script and they 
start advocating totalitarianism, trea-
son, or what have you, they are not liv-
ing up to the duties of their office as 
teacher. They can be fired. 
Everybody knows that, and it hap-
pens all the time, by the way, includ-
ing to cops and firefighters and people 
on the frontlines. It happens all the 
time. In fact, it happened countless 
times to people fired by President 
Trump for their statements or ideas 
about things, including on election 
fraud, not long ago. There are people in 
the government who lost their jobs be-
cause the President didn’t like what 
they said or what they wrote. 
Now, as I mentioned yesterday—and I 
can’t help but repeat it—Justice Scalia 
got it exactly right on this. He wrote 
on these cases about how the First 
Amendment affects people who take on 
a public office, who take on public em-
ployment, and he summed it up like 
this. He said: 
You can’t ride with the cops but root for 
the robbers. 
You can’t ride with the cops but root for 
the robbers. 
That is what Justice Scalia said, and 
when it comes to the peaceful transfer 
of power, to the rule of law, to respect-
ing election outcomes, our President, 
whoever he or she is, must choose the 
side of the Constitution—must—and 
not the side of the insurrection or the 
coup or anybody who is coming against 
us. 
And if he or she chooses the wrong 
side, I am sorry, there is nothing in 
this First Amendment or anywhere 
else in the Constitution that can ex-
cuse your betrayal of your oath of of-
fice. It is not a free speech question. 
But there is more. Let’s play make- 
believe and pretend that President 
Trump was just a run-of-the-mill pri-
vate citizen—as my colleague Mr. 
NEGUSE said, just another guy at the 
rally—who is just expressing a deeply 
unpopular 
opinion, 
because 
we 
shouldn’t overlook the fact that, while 
there were thousands of people in that 
violent mob, they represent a tiny, 
tiny, tiny part of less than 1 percent of 
the population, and the vast majority 
of the American people reject the kind 
of seditious mob violence that we saw 
on January 6. 
But let’s say that he was just another 
guy in the crowd that day. It is a bed-
rock principle that nobody—nobody— 
can incite a riot. The First Amendment 
doesn’t protect it. 
Key 
case? 
Brandenburg 
v. 
Ohio. 
There is no First amendment protec-
tion for speech directed to inciting and 
producing imminent lawless action and 
likely to produce such action. 
And for all the reasons you have 
heard, based on the voluminous, com-
prehensive, totally unrefuted—and we 
think irrefutable, but we are eager to 
hear our colleagues—based on all the 
evidence you have heard, and for all 
the reasons you have heard, that defi-
nition of proscribable speech fits Presi-
dent Trump’s conduct perfectly. This is 
a classic case of incitement. 
And you don’t have to take my word 
for it. The 144 free speech lawyers, 
which Mr. NEGUSE mentioned, who in-
clude many of the Nation’s most dedi-
cated, 
most 
uncompromising 
free 
speech advocates—unlike Mr. Trump, 
of course—but these people agree that 
there is a powerful case for conviction 
under the Brandenburg standard, even 
if the President of the United States 
were just to be treated like some guy 
in the crowd. And they add: 
The First Amendment is no defense to the 
article of impeachment leveled against the 
former President . . . 
And I mention the Brandenburg 
standard not because it applies here. Of 
course, it doesn’t. This is an impeach-
ment. It is not a criminal trial, and 
there is no risk of jail time. Let’s be 
clear about that. The President doesn’t 
go to jail for 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour, or 
1 minute based on impeachment and 
conviction and disqualification from 
further office. 
Rather, I mention it to emphasize 
that absolutely nobody in America 
would 
be 
protected 
by 
the 
First 
Amendment if they did all the things 
that Donald Trump did. Nobody made 
Donald Trump run for President and 
swear an oath to preserve, protect, and 
defend the Constitution on January 20, 
2017. But when he did, by virtue of 
swearing that oath and entering this 
high office, he took upon himself a 
duty to affirm and take care that our 
laws 
would 
be 
faithfully 
executed 
under his leadership—all of the laws, 
the laws against Federal destruction of 
property, all of the laws. We expected 
him in everything he said and every-
thing he did to protect and preserve 
and defend our constitutional system, 
including the separation of powers. 
But, instead, he betrayed us, and as 
Representative CHENEY said, it was the 
greatest betrayal of a Presidential oath 
in the history of the United States of 
America—the greatest. 
As I mentioned yesterday, President 
Trump is not even close to the prover-
bial citizen who falsely shouts ‘‘fire’’ in 
a crowded theater. He is like the now 
proverbial municipal fire chief who in-
cites a mob to go set the theater on 
fire, and not only refuses to put out the 
fire but encourages the mob to keep 
going as the blaze spreads. 
We would hold that fire chief ac-
countable. We would forbid him from 
that job ever again, and that is exactly 
what must happen here. 
There are hundreds of millions of 
citizens who can be President. Donald 
Trump has disqualified himself, and 
you must disqualify him too. 
Just like the fire chief who sends the 
mob, President Trump perverted his of-
fice by attacking the very Constitution 
he was sworn to uphold. In fact, that is 
one reason why this free speech rhet-
oric at this trial is so insidious. His 
conduct represented the most dev-
astating and dangerous assault by a 
government official on our Constitu-
tion, including the First Amendment, 
in living memory. We wouldn’t have 
free speech or any of the rights if we 
didn’t have the rule of law and peaceful 
transfer of power and a democracy 
where the outcome of the election is 
accepted by the candidate who lost. We 
had it all the way up until 2020. 
And the central purposes of the First 
Amendment are democratic self-gov-
ernment and civic truth seeking—two 
purposes that President Trump sought 
to undermine, not advance, in the 
course of his conduct as we have defini-
tively demonstrated at this trial. 
The violence he incited threatened 
all of our freedoms. It threatened the 
very constitutional order that protects 
free speech, due process, religious free 
exercise, the right to vote, equal pro-
tection, and the many other funda-
mental rights that we all treasure and 
cherish as citizens of the United 
States. 
The First Amendment does not cre-
ate some superpower immunity from 
impeachment for a President who at-
tacks the Constitution in word, in 
deed, while rejecting the outcome of an 
election he happened to lose. 
If anything, President Trump’s con-
duct was an assault on the First 
Amendment 
and 
equal 
protection 
rights that millions of Americans exer-
cised when they voted last year, often 
under extraordinarily difficult and ar-
duous circumstances. 
Remember, the First Amendment 
protects the right of the people to 
speak about the great issues of our 
day, to debate during elections, and 
then to participate in politics by se-
lecting the people who will be our lead-
ers. 
And remember, in American democ-
racy those of us who aspire and attain 
the public office are nothing but the 
servants of the people—nothing. Not 
the masters of the people—we have no 
kings here. We have no czars. 
Here, the people govern, President 
Ford said—the people. 
The most important words of the 
Constitution are the first three—‘‘We 
the People.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S661 
February 11, 2021 
But all this—all this—means little if 
a President who dislikes the election 
results can incite violence to try to re-
place and usurp the will of the people 
as expressed in the States, ignore the 
judicial branch of government, and 
then run over the legislative branch of 
government with a mob. 
President Trump’s high crimes and 
misdemeanors sought to nullify the po-
litical rights and sovereignty of the 
American people—our right as a people 
to deliberate, to form opinions, to per-
suade each other to vote, and then to 
decide who our President will be—the 
sovereignty of the people. That is an 
attack on the First Amendment, I 
would say. 
In addition, President Trump’s ac-
tions were a direct attack on our own 
freedom of speech here in the Capitol. 
Members of Congress are sent here to 
speak for their constituents. That is 
why we have our own little ‘‘mini free 
speech’’ clause—the speech and debate 
clause. That is literally our job when 
we come here and represent the views 
of our people. 
The attack that President Trump in-
cited forced Members of Congress to 
stop speaking and to literally flee for 
our lives and the lives of our staffs and 
our families. The man whose state-
ments and actions halted the speech in 
Congress—speech related to the peace-
ful transfer of power—has no right, no 
right, to claim that free speech prin-
ciples prevent this body from exer-
cising its constitutional power to hold 
him accountable for his offense against 
us. 
You know, Voltaire said famously, 
and our Founders knew it: 
I may disagree with everything you say, 
but I will defend with my life your right to 
say it. 
President Trump says: Because I dis-
agree with everything you say, I will 
overturn your popular election and in-
cite insurrection against the govern-
ment. 
And we might take a moment to con-
sider another Voltaire insight, which a 
high school teacher of mine told me 
when her student asked: When was the 
beginning of the Enlightenment? 
And she said: I think it was when 
Voltaire said: 
Anyone who can make you believe absurd-
ities, can make you commit atrocities. 
There is no merit whatsoever to any 
of the free speech rhetoric—the empty 
free speech rhetoric—you may hear 
from President Trump’s lawyers. He at-
tacked the First Amendment. He at-
tacked the Constitution. He betrayed 
his oath of office. Presidents don’t have 
any right to do that. It is forbidden so 
that our Republic may survive. The 
people are far more important than 
that. 
The precedent he asks you to create, 
which would allow any future Presi-
dent to do precisely what he did, is 
self-evidently dangerous, and so there 
can be no doubt—none at all—that the 
President lacks any First Amendment 
excuse or defense or immunity. He in-
cited a violent insurrection against our 
government. He must be convicted. 
And now I am going to call up Rep-
resentative DEAN, who will explain 
why, 
contrary 
to 
the 
President’s 
claims, the House provided him with 
all the process that was due to him. 
I am sorry. Mr. LIEU is going to do 
that. 
Mr. Manager LIEU. Thank you for 
your time and your attention. 
We all heard President Trump’s at-
torneys on Tuesday, and as part of 
President Trump’s efforts to avoid 
talking about his own conduct, to 
avoid talking about anything related 
to this constitutional crime, we expect 
that President Trump will raise due 
process objections. 
His due process claims are without 
merit. Under the Constitution, the 
House has ‘‘the sole Power of Impeach-
ment.’’ That provision confirms that 
the House functions as a grand jury or 
a prosecutor. The House decides wheth-
er to bring charges. 
Now, on other impeachment cases, 
the House can provide certain delibera-
tive and procedural privileges to the 
person being impeached, but those are 
exactly that—privileges. They are dis-
cretionary. The House has the power to 
decide its own rules, how it wants to 
pass the Article of Impeachment, and 
in this case, the House debated the Ar-
ticle of Impeachment and passed it on 
a bipartisan vote. 
I am a former prosecutor. I just want 
to add that I have had opportunities to 
decide whether to bring charges, and 
when you see a crime committed in 
plain view, prosecutors don’t have to 
spend months investigating before they 
bring charges. I know that in this case, 
in fact, hundreds of people have been 
arrested and charged by prosecutors for 
the violence on January 6. There was 
no reason for the House to wait to im-
peach the man at the very top that in-
cited the violence. 
I would also like to emphasize that 
the House had good reason to move 
quickly. This was an exigent cir-
cumstance. This was not a case where 
there was hidden conduct or some con-
spiracy 
that 
required 
months 
and 
maybe years of investigation. 
This case has not raised very com-
plicated legal issues. The gravity of the 
President’s 
conduct 
demanded 
the 
clearest of responses from the legisla-
ture, particularly given that the Presi-
dent was still in office at the time the 
House approved this Article and ru-
mors of further violence echoed around 
the country. They still do. 
There must be absolutely no doubt 
that 
Congress 
will 
act 
decisively 
against a President who incites vio-
lence against us. That is why the House 
moved quickly here, and President 
Trump, who created that emergency, 
cannot be here to complain that the 
House impeached him too quickly for 
the emergency he caused. 
Another point on the due process 
question: Earlier in this trial, Presi-
dent Trump’s attorneys suggested that 
the House somehow deliberately de-
layed the transmission of this Article 
of Impeachment. That is simply not ac-
curate. 
When the House adopted this Article 
of Impeachment on a bipartisan vote, 
we were ready to begin trial, but the 
Senate was not in session at the time. 
And when we inquired as to our op-
tions, Senate officials told us, clearly, 
and in no uncertain terms, that if the 
Clerk of the House attempted to de-
liver the Article of Impeachment to 
the Secretary of the Senate before the 
Senate reconvened, that the Clerk of 
the House would have been turned back 
at the door. That is why the trial did 
not begin then—another reason why 
the President’s objections of due proc-
ess are meritless. 
Finally, let me just conclude that 
you all are going to see and have seen 
a full presentation of evidence by the 
House, and you are going to hear a full 
presentation by the President’s attor-
neys. You are going to be able to ask 
questions. The Senate has the sole 
power to try all impeachments. Presi-
dent Trump is receiving any and all 
process that he is due right here in this 
Chamber. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
Senators, in just a moment, my col-
league, Mr. NEGUSE, will return to 
show that we have established, with 
overwhelming evidence, that President 
Trump engaged in high crimes and mis-
demeanors. Before Mr. NEGUSE comes 
up, though, I would like to emphasize 
what should be an uncontroversial 
point but is really key to understand. 
If we have proven to you the conduct 
that we have alleged in this Article, 
then President Trump has indeed com-
mitted a high crime and misdemeanor 
under the Constitution. Incitement of 
insurrection under these circumstances 
is, undoubtedly, in the words of George 
Mason from the Constitutional Conven-
tion, a ‘‘great and dangerous’’ offense 
against the Republic. Indeed, it is hard 
to think of a greater or more dan-
gerous offense against the Republic 
than this one. 
So to be very precise about this, I 
hope we all can agree today that if a 
President does incite a violent insur-
rection against the government, he can 
be impeached for it. I hope we all can 
agree that that is a constitutional 
crime. 
Another key point: While President 
Trump’s lawyers may be arguing other-
wise, the question here is not whether 
President Trump committed a crime 
under the Federal Code or DC law or 
the law of any State. Impeachment 
does not result in criminal penalties, 
as we keep emphasizing. No one spends 
a day in jail. There are not even crimi-
nal or civil fines. Centuries of history, 
not to mention the constitutional text, 
structure, and original intent and un-
derstanding, all confirm the teaching 
of James Wilson, another Framer, who 
wrote ‘‘that impeachments and of-
fenses come not within the sphere of 
ordinary jurisprudence.’’ Simply put,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S662 
February 11, 2021 
impeachment was created for a purpose 
separate and distinct from criminal 
punishment. It was created to prevent 
and deter elected officials who swear 
an oath to represent America but then 
commit dangerous offenses against our 
Republic. That is a constitutional 
crime. 
And Senators, what greater offense 
could one commit than to incite the 
violent insurrection at our seat of gov-
ernment during the peaceful transfer of 
power—in circumstances where vio-
lence is foreseeable, where a crowd is 
poised for violence, to provoke a mob 
of thousands to attack us with weapons 
and sticks and poles, to bludgeon and 
beat our law enforcement officers and 
to deface these sacred walls and to 
trash the place and to do so while seek-
ing to stop us from fulfilling our own 
oaths, our own duties to uphold the 
Constitution by counting the votes 
from our free and fair elections and 
then to sit back and watch in delight 
as insurrectionists attack us, violating 
a sacred oath and engaging in a pro-
found dereliction and desertion of duty. 
How can we assure that our Com-
mander in Chief will protect, preserve, 
and defend our Constitution if we don’t 
hold a President accountable in a cir-
cumstance like this? What is impeach-
able conduct, if not this? I challenge 
you all to think about it. If you think 
this is not impeachable, what is? What 
would be? 
If President Trump’s lawyers endorse 
his breathtaking assertion that his 
conduct in inciting these events was 
totally appropriate and the Senate ac-
quits Donald Trump, then any Presi-
dent could incite and provoke insurrec-
tionary violence against us again. If 
you don’t find this a high crime and 
misdemeanor today, you have set a 
new, terrible standard for Presidential 
misconduct in the United States of 
America. 
The only real question here is the 
factual one. Did we prove that Donald 
Trump, while President of the United 
States, incite a violent insurrection 
against the government? 
Incitement, of course, is an inher-
ently 
fact-based 
and 
fact-intensive 
judgment, which is why we commend 
you all for your scrupulous attention 
to everything that took place, but we 
believe that we have shown you over-
whelming evidence in this case that 
would convince anyone using their 
common sense that this was indeed in-
citement—meaning 
that 
Donald 
Trump’s conduct encouraged violence; 
the violence was foreseeable; and he 
acted willfully in the actions that in-
curred violence. 
Mr. NEGUSE will take you through 
that evidence again—not the whole 
thing. We are almost done. We are al-
most done, but we don’t want it to be 
said that they never proved this or 
they never proved that because my 
magnificent team of managers has 
stayed up night after night after night, 
through weeks, to compile all of the 
factual evidence, and we have put it be-
fore you and we have put it before all 
of you in this public trial because we 
love our country that much. 
Mr. NEGUSE will show you that we 
have proven our case and that Presi-
dent Trump committed this impeach-
able offense that we impeached him for 
on January 13 and that you should con-
vict him. And when he is finished, I 
will return and explain why it is dan-
gerous for us to ignore this and why 
you must convict, and then we will 
rest. 
Mr. NEGUSE. 
Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. Presi-
dent, 
distinguished 
Senators, 
good 
afternoon, again. As my colleague, 
Lead Manager RASKIN, has mentioned, 
I know it has been a long few days, and 
I want to say thank you. We are very 
grateful for your patience, for your at-
tention, and the attention that you 
have paid to every one of our managers 
as they presented our case. 
As Lead Manager RASKIN mentioned, 
I hope, I trust, that we could all agree 
that if a President incites a violent in-
surrection against our government, 
that that is impeachable conduct. 
So what I would like to do as we 
close our case is just walk you through 
why our evidence overwhelmingly es-
tablishes that President Trump com-
mitted that offense. 
Now, as you consider that question, 
that question as to whether the Presi-
dent incited insurrection, there are 
three questions that reasonably come 
to mind: Was violence foreseeable; did 
he encourage violence; and did he act 
willfully? 
I am going to show you why the an-
swer to every one of those questions 
has to be yes. 
First, let’s start with foreseeability. 
Was it foreseeable that violence would 
erupt on January 6 if President Trump 
lit a spark? Was it predictable that the 
crowd at the Save America rally was 
poised on a hair trigger for violence, 
that they would fight, literally, if pro-
voked to do so? Of course, it was. 
When President Trump stood up to 
that podium on January 6, he knew 
that many in that crowd were in-
flamed, were armed, were ready for vio-
lence. It was an explosive situation, 
and he knew it. We have shown you the 
evidence on this point. You have seen 
it—the images, the videos, the articles, 
and the pattern which showed that the 
violence on that terrible day was en-
tirely foreseeable. 
We have showed you how this all 
began with the big lie, the claim that 
the election was rigged, and that Presi-
dent Trump and his supporters were 
the victims of a massive fraud, a mas-
sive conspiracy to rip away their votes. 
We have showed you how President 
Trump spread that lie, and how, over 
the course of months, with his support 
and encouragement, it inflamed part of 
his base, resulting in death threats, 
real-world violence, and increasingly 
extreme calls to stop the steal. 
We established that after he lost the 
election, the President was willing to 
do just about anything to prevent the 
peaceful transfer of power; that he 
tried everything he could do to stop it. 
You will recall the evidence on the 
screen: him pressuring and threatening 
State 
election 
officials, 
attacking 
them to the point of literally calling 
them enemies of the state, threatening 
at least one of them with criminal pen-
alties; then, attacking Senators, Mem-
bers of Congress, all across the media; 
pressuring the Justice Department, 
prompting outcries from assistant U.S. 
attorneys, not to mention his own At-
torney General, reportedly telling him 
that the stolen election claims were 
‘‘BS’’—not my phrase, his. 
And then, as January 6 approached, 
he moved on to attacking his own Vice 
President openly and savagely. 
We have recounted, throughout that 
entire period, all the ways in which 
President Trump inflamed his sup-
porters with lies that the election was 
stolen. As every single one of us knows, 
nothing in this country is more sa-
cred—nothing—than our right to vote, 
our voice, and here you have the Presi-
dent of the United States telling his 
supporters that their voice, that their 
rights as Americans were being stolen 
from them, ripped away. That made 
them angry, angry enough to stop the 
steal, to fight like hell to stop the 
steal. 
And we showed you this. You saw the 
endless tweets, the rallies, and the 
statements encouraging and spreading 
that big lie. You saw that he did this 
over and over again with the same mes-
sage each time: You must fight to win 
it back. You must never surrender, no 
matter what. 
And remember, each time, his sup-
porters along the way showed violence. 
He endorsed it, encouraged it, and 
praised it. It was all part of that same 
demand to stop the steal and fight like 
hell. 
Remember the video that Manager 
PLASKETT
showed you from Texas? 
Some of his supporters encircling a bus 
of campaign workers on a highway? 
People easily could have been killed— 
easily. What did he do? He tweeted and 
made a joke about it at a rally, called 
them patriots and held them out as an 
example of what it means to stop the 
steal. 
When he told his supporters to stop 
the steal, they took up arms to lit-
erally intimidate officials to overturn 
the election results. You saw the evi-
dence and so did he, and he welcomed 
it. 
When 
President 
Trump 
attacked 
Georgia’s secretary of state for certi-
fying the results, his supporters sent 
death threats. You saw those in great 
detail from Manager DEAN. What did he 
do? He attacked the election officials 
further. 
When his supporters gathered to-
gether to have a second Million MAGA 
rally—that is the rally that Manager 
PLASKETT showed you, a rally about 
the stolen election—he tweeted that 
the fight had just begun. What hap-
pened next? It is not rocket science.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S663 
February 11, 2021 
Fights broke out, stabbings, serious vi-
olence. 
Now, President Trump, like all of us, 
he saw what happened at that rally. He 
saw all the violence, the burning, and 
chaos. How did he respond? He tweeted 
praise of the event, and then—see it on 
the screen—he bought $50 million—$50 
million worth of ads to further pro-
mote his message to those exact same 
people. He immediately joined forces 
with that very same group. He joined 
forces with the same people who had 
just erupted into violence. 
Was violence predictable? Was it ob-
vious that the crowd on January 6 was 
poised for violence, prepared for it? Ab-
solutely. And this isn’t just clear look-
ing back in time; it was widely recog-
nized at the time. In the days leading 
up to January 6, there were dozens, 
hundreds of warnings. And he knew it. 
He knew the rally would explode if pro-
voked. He knew all it would take was a 
slight push. 
Remember, you heard from Manager 
PLASKETT the chatter on social media 
websites that the Trump administra-
tion monitored and were known to the 
Trump operation. It showed that the 
people he invited to the January 6 rally 
took this as a serious call to arms, that 
this was not just any attack, it was to 
storm the Capitol, if necessary, to stop 
the steal. 
And it wasn’t just clear on these 
websites that the Trump administra-
tion was monitoring; the FBI issued re-
ports about this credible threat, a 
threat to target us. Law enforcement 
made six arrests the night before. Six 
arrests. Newspapers across the city 
warned of the risk of violence. 
There can be no doubt that the risk 
of violence was foreseeable. 
What did he do in the days leading up 
to the rally? Did he calm the situation? 
Ask yourself, I mean, did he call for 
peace? No. He didn’t do that. He spread 
his big lie, the most dangerous lie, as I 
mentioned, that Americans’ votes were 
being stolen and that the final act of 
theft would occur here in the Capitol. 
Then he assembled all of those sup-
porters. He invited them to an orga-
nized event on a specific day at a spe-
cific time matched perfectly to coin-
cide with the joint session of Congress, 
to coincide with the steal that he had 
told them to stop by any and all 
means. 
Again, he was told by law enforce-
ment and all over the news that these 
people were armed and ready for real 
violence. He knew it. He knew it per-
fectly well, that he had created this 
powder keg at his rally. He knew just 
how combustible that situation was. 
He knew there were people before him 
who had prepared, who were armed and 
armored. He knew they would jump to 
violence at any signal, at any sign 
from him that he needed them to fight, 
that he needed them to stop the steal, 
and we all know what happened next. 
Second question. Did he encourage 
the violence? Standing in that powder 
keg, did he light a match? Everyone 
knows the answer to that question. The 
hours of video you all have watched 
leave no doubt. Just remember what he 
said on January 6. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. All of us here today do 
not want to see our election victory stolen. 
There’s never been anything like this. It’s 
a pure theft in American history. Everybody 
knows it. Make no mistake, this election was 
stolen from you, from me, from the country. 
In the opening of— 
(Text of video presentation.) 
President TRUMP. We will never give up. 
We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. 
You don’t concede when there’s theft in-
volved. 
And to use a favorite term that all of you 
people really came up with: ‘‘We will stop 
the steal. We will stop the steal.’’ 
We will not let them silence your voices. 
We’re not going to let it happen. Not going 
to let it happen. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’ 
President TRUMP. Thank you. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
President TRUMP. You have to get your 
people to fight because you’ll never take 
back our country with weakness. You have 
to show strength, and you have to be strong. 
And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you 
don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have 
a country anymore. 
You may remember at the outset of 
this trial, I told you would hear three 
phrases over and over and over again: 
The big lie that the election had been 
stolen, ‘‘stop the steal and never con-
cede,’’ and ‘‘fight like hell to stop that 
steal.’’ 
You 
heard 
those 
phrases 
throughout the course of this trial, 
video after video, statement after 
statement, telling his supporters that 
they should be patriots, to fight hard, 
stop the steal. On that day, that day, 
where did he direct the crowd’s ire? He 
directed them here to Congress. He 
quite literally in one part of that 
speech pointed at us. He told them to 
‘‘fight like hell. And if you don’t fight 
like hell, you’re not going to have a 
country anymore.’’ 
And here is the thing. That wasn’t 
metaphorical. It wasn’t rhetorical. He 
already made it perfectly clear that 
when he said ‘‘fight,’’ he meant it. And 
when followers, in fact, fought, when 
they engaged in violence, he praised 
and honored them as patriots. He im-
plied that it was OK to break the law 
because the election was being stolen. 
You heard it. You remember the clip 
that Manager DEAN showed you earlier 
in this trial. He told them—the quote 
is on the screen—‘‘When you catch 
somebody in a fraud, you’re allowed to 
go by very different rules.’’ 
Remember how all of his supporters— 
some of his supporters across social 
media were treating this as a war, 
talking about bringing in the cavalry? 
Well, President Trump made clear 
what those different rules were. He had 
been making it clear for months. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. Giuliani. So let’s have trial by combat. 
President TRUMP. And, Rudy, you did a 
great job. He’s got guts. You know what? 
He’s got guts, unlike a lot of people in the 
Republican Party. He’s got guts. He fights. 
His message was crystal clear, and it 
was understood immediately, instantly 
by his followers. And we don’t have to 
guess. We don’t have to guess as to how 
they reacted. We can look at how peo-
ple reacted to what he said. You saw 
them, and you saw the violence. It is 
pretty simple: He said it, and they did 
it. And we know this because they told 
us. They told us in real time during the 
attack. You saw the affidavits, the 
interviews on social media and on live 
TV. They were doing this for him be-
cause he asked them to. 
It wasn’t just insurrectionists who 
confirmed this. Many, many people, in-
cluding current and former officials, 
immediately recognized that the Presi-
dent had incited the crowd, that he 
alone was capable of stopping the vio-
lence, that he did this, and he had to 
call it off because he was the only one 
who could. 
Let’s 
see 
what 
Representative 
MCCARTHY, Representative GALLAGHER, 
Chris 
Christie, 
Representative 
KINZINGER, and Representative KATKO 
had to say. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. I could not be sadder or 
more disappointed with the way our country 
looks at this very moment. People are get-
ting hurt. Anyone involved in this, if you’re 
hearing me, hear me loud and clear: This is 
not the American way. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. President, you have 
got to stop this. You are the only person who 
can call this off. Call it off. 
Mr. Christie. It’s pretty simple. The Presi-
dent caused this protest to occur. He’s the 
only one who could make it stop. 
What the President says is not good 
enough. 
The President has to come out and tell his 
supporters to leave the Capitol grounds and 
to allow the Congress to do their business 
peacefully, and anything short of that is an 
abrogation of his responsibility. 
Mr. KINZINGER. You know, a guy that 
knows how to tweet very aggressively on 
Twitter, you know, puts out one of the weak-
est statements on one of the saddest days in 
American history. 
Mr. KATKO. The President’s role in this 
insurrection is undeniable, both on social 
media ahead of January 6 and in his speech 
that day. He deliberately promoted baseless 
theories, creating a combustible environ-
ment of disinformation and division. To 
allow the President of the United States to 
incite this attack without consequences is a 
direct threat to the future of this democ-
racy. 
Did the President encourage vio-
lence? Yes, no doubt that he did. 
Final question: Did the President act 
willfully in his actions that encouraged 
violence? Well, let’s look at the facts. 
He stood before an armed, angry crowd 
known to be ready for violence at his 
provocation. And what did he do? He 
provoked them. He aimed them here, 
told them to ‘‘fight like hell.’’ And 
that is exactly what they did. 
And his conduct throughout the rest 
of that terrible day really only con-
firms that he acted willfully, that he 
incited the crowd and then engaged in 
the dereliction of duty while he contin-
ued inflaming the violence. And, again, 
we don’t have to guess what he thought 
because he told us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S664 
February 11, 2021 
Remember the video he released at 
4:17 p.m.? Lead Manager Raskin showed 
that to you yesterday, the one where 
he said: 
We had an election that was stolen from 
us. 
Remember the tweet that he put out 
just a couple hours later, 6:01 p.m., on 
January 6? You have seen it many 
times. You could see it on the slide: 
These are the things that happen when a 
sacred 
landslide 
election 
victory 
is 
so 
unceremoniously & viciously stripped away. 
That is what he was focused on, 
spreading the big lie and praising the 
mob that attacked us and our govern-
ment. 
You heard Manager CICILLINE
de-
scribe reports that the President was 
delighted, enthusiastic, confused that 
others didn’t share his excitement as 
he watched the attack unfold on TV. 
He cared more about pressing his ef-
forts to overturn the election than he 
did about saving lives, our lives. 
Look at what President Trump did 
that day after the rally. It is impor-
tant. He did virtually nothing. 
We have seen—Manager CASTRO men-
tioned 
this—that 
when 
President 
Trump wants to stop something, he 
does so simply, easily, quickly. But 
aside from four tweets and a short clip 
during the over 5-hour long attack, he 
did nothing. 
On January 6, he didn’t condemn the 
attack, didn’t condemn the attackers, 
didn’t say that he would send help to 
defend us or defend law enforcement. 
He didn’t react to the violence with 
shock or horror or dismay, as we did. 
He didn’t immediately rush to Twitter 
and demand in the clearest possible 
terms that the mob disperse, that they 
stop it, that they retreat. Instead, he 
issued messages in the afternoon that 
sided with them, the insurrectionists 
who had left police officers battered 
and bloodied. 
He reacted exactly the way someone 
would react if they were delighted and 
exactly unlike how a person would 
react if they were angry at how their 
followers were acting. 
Again, ask yourself how many lives 
would have been saved, how much pain 
and trauma would have been avoided if 
he had reacted the way that a Presi-
dent of the United States is supposed 
to act. 
There are two parts of President 
Trump’s failure here—his dereliction of 
duty—that I just have to emphasize for 
a moment. 
First is what he did to Vice President 
Mike Pence, the Vice President of the 
United States of America. His own Vice 
President was in this building with an 
armed mob shouting ‘‘Hang him,’’ the 
same armed mob that set up gallows 
outside. You saw those pictures. 
And what did President Trump do? 
He attacked him more. He singled him 
out by name. It is honestly hard to 
fathom. 
Second, our law enforcement—the 
brave officers who were sacrificing 
their lives to defend us, who could not 
evacuate or seek cover because they 
were protecting us. I am not going to 
go through again what my fellow man-
agers showed you yesterday, but let me 
just say this: Those officers serve us 
faithfully and dutifully, and they fol-
low their oaths. They deserve a Presi-
dent who upholds his, who would not 
risk their lives and safety to retain 
power, a President who would preserve, 
protect, and defend them. But that is 
not what he did. 
When they, the police, still barri-
caded and being attacked with poles— 
he said in his video to the people at-
tacking them: 
We love you. You’re very special. 
What more could we possibly need to 
know about President Trump’s state of 
mind? 
Senators, the evidence is clear. We 
showed you statements, videos, affida-
vits that prove President Trump in-
cited an insurrection—an insurrection 
that he alone had the power to stop. 
And the fact that he didn’t stop it, the 
fact that he incited a lawless attack 
and abdicated his duty to defend us 
from it, the fact that he actually fur-
ther inflamed the mob—further in-
flamed that mob attacking his Vice 
President while assassins were pur-
suing him in this Capitol—more than 
requires conviction and disqualifica-
tion. 
We humbly—humbly ask you to con-
vict President Trump for the crime for 
which he is overwhelmingly guilty be-
cause if you don’t, if we pretend this 
didn’t happen or, worse, if we let it go 
unanswered, who is to say it won’t hap-
pen again? 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
Members of the Senate, first of all, 
thank you for your close attention and 
seriousness of purpose that you have 
demonstrated over the last few days. 
Thank you also for your courtesy to 
the House managers as we have come 
over here, strangers in a strange land, 
to make our case before this distin-
guished and august body. 
We are about to close. And I am 
proud that our managers have been so 
disciplined and so focused. I think we 
are closing somewhere between 5 and 6 
hours under the time that you have al-
lotted to us, but we think we have been 
able to tell you everything we need to 
say. We will, obviously, have the oppor-
tunity to address your questions and 
then to do a final closing when we get 
there. 
I just wanted to leave you with a few 
thoughts. And, again, I am not going to 
retraumatize you by going through the 
evidence once again. I just wanted to 
leave you with a few thoughts to con-
sider as you enter upon this very high 
and difficult duty that you have to 
render impartial justice in this case, as 
you have all sworn to do. 
And I wanted to start simply by say-
ing that, in the history of humanity, 
democracy is an extremely rare and 
fragile and precarious and transitory 
thing. Abraham Lincoln knew that 
when he spoke from the battlefield and 
vowed that ‘‘government of the people, 
by the people, [and] for the people shall 
not perish from the earth.’’ He was 
speaking not long after the Republic 
was created, and he was trying to prove 
that point, that we would not allow it 
to perish from the Earth. 
For most of history, the norm has 
been dictators, autocrats, bullies, des-
pots, tirades, cowards who take over 
our government—for most of the his-
tory of the world—and that is why 
America is such a miracle. We were 
founded on the extraordinary prin-
ciples of the inalienable rights of the 
people and the consent of the governed 
and the fundamental equality of all of 
us. 
You know, when Lincoln said ‘‘gov-
ernment of the people, by the people, 
[and] for the people’’ and he hearkened 
back to the Declaration of Independ-
ence, when he said ‘‘Four score and 
seven years ago,’’ he knew that that 
wasn’t how we started. We started im-
perfectly. We started as a slave repub-
lic. Lincoln knew that. But he was 
struggling to make the country better. 
And however flawed the Founders 
were as men in their times, they in-
scribed in the Declaration of Independ-
ence and the Constitution all the beau-
tiful principles that we needed to open 
America up to successive waves of po-
litical 
struggle 
and 
constitutional 
change and transformation in the 
country so we really would become 
something much more like Lincoln’s 
beautiful vision of ‘‘government of the 
people, by the people, [and] for the peo-
ple’’—the world’s greatest, multiracial, 
multireligious, multiethnic constitu-
tional democracy, the envy of the 
world, as Tom Paine said, an asylum 
for 
humanity 
where 
people 
would 
come. 
Think about the preamble, those first 
three words pregnant with such mean-
ing, ‘‘We the People,’’ and then all of 
the purposes of our government put 
into that one action-packed sentence: 
‘‘We the People . . . in Order to form a 
more perfect Union, establish Justice, 
insure domestic Tranquility, provide 
for the common defense, promote the 
general Welfare, and [preserve] to our-
selves and our Posterity’’ the blessings 
of liberty. 
And then, right after that first sen-
tence—the 
mission 
statement 
for 
America, the Constitution—what hap-
pens? Article I. The Congress is cre-
ated: All legislative powers herein are 
reserved to the Congress of the United 
States. 
You see what just happened? The sov-
ereign power of the people to launch 
the country and create the Constitu-
tion flowed right into Congress. And 
then you get in article I, section 8 com-
prehensive, vast powers that all of you 
know so well—the power to regulate 
commerce 
domestically 
and 
inter-
nationally, the power to declare war, 
the power to raise budgets and taxes 
and to spend money, the power to gov-
ern the seat of government, and on and 
on and on.

And then, even in article 1, section 8, 
clause 18, all other powers ‘‘necessary 
and proper’’ to the foregoing powers. 
That is all of us. 
Then you get to article II, the Presi-
dent, four short paragraphs. And the 
fourth paragraph is all about what? Im-
peachment—how you get rid of a Presi-
dent who commits high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
What is the core job of the President? 
To take care that the laws are faith-
fully executed. 
And our Framers were so fearful of 
Presidents becoming tyrants and want-
ing to become Kings and despots that 
they put the oath of office right into 
the Constitution. They inscribed it 
into the Constitution: to ‘‘preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution of 
the United States.’’ 
We have got the power to impeach 
the President. The President doesn’t 
have the power to impeach us. Think 
about that. The popular branch of gov-
ernment has the power to impeach the 
President. The President does not have 
the power to impeach us. 
And, as I said before, all of us who as-
pire and attain a public office are noth-
ing but the servants of the people. And 
the way the Framers would have it is 
the moment that we no longer acted as 
servants of the people but as masters of 
the people, as violators of the people’s 
rights, that was the time to impeach, 
remove, convict, disqualify, start all 
over again, because the interests of the 
people are so much greater than the in-
terests of one person—any one person, 
even the greatest person in the coun-
try. The interests of the people are 
what count. 
Now, when we sit down and we close, 
our distinguished counterparts, the de-
fense counsel, who have waited very 
patiently—and thank you—will stand 
up and seek to defend the President’s 
conduct on the facts, as I think they 
will. 
It has already been decided by the 
Senate on Tuesday that the Senate has 
constitutional jurisdiction over this 
impeachment case brought to you by 
the United States House of Representa-
tives. So we have put that jurisdic-
tional, constitutional issue to bed. It is 
over. It has already been voted on. 
This is a trial on the facts of what 
happened. And incitement, as we said, 
is a fact-intensive investigation and 
judgment that each of you will have to 
make. 
We have made our very best effort to 
set forth every single relevant fact 
that we know in the most objective and 
honest light. We trust and we hope that 
the defense will understand the con-
stitutional gravity and solemnity of 
this trial by focusing like a laser beam 
on the facts and not return to the con-
stitutional argument that has already 
been decided by the Senate. 
Just as a defense lawyer who loses a 
motion to dismiss on a constitutional 
basis in a criminal case must let that 
go and then focus on the facts which 
are being presented by the prosecutors 
in detail, they must let this constitu-
tional jurisdictional argument go—not 
just because it is frivolous and wrong, 
as nearly every expert scholar in Amer-
ica opined, but because it is not rel-
evant to the jury’s consideration of the 
facts of the case. 
So our friends must work to answer 
all of the overwhelming, detailed, spe-
cific, factual, and documentary evi-
dence we have introduced of the Presi-
dent’s clear and overwhelming guilt in 
inciting violent insurrection against 
the Union. 
Donald Trump, last week, turned 
down our invitation to come testify 
about his actions, and, therefore, we 
have not been able to ask him any 
questions directly as of this point. 
Therefore, during the course of their 
16-hour-allotted presentation, we would 
pose these preliminary questions to his 
lawyers, which I think are on every-
one’s minds right now and which we 
would have asked Mr. Trump himself if 
he had chosen to come and testify 
about his actions and inactions when 
we invited him last week: 
One, why did President Trump not 
tell his supporters to stop the attack 
on the Capitol as soon as he learned of 
it? 
Why did President Trump do nothing 
to stop the attack for at least 2 hours 
after the attack began? 
As our constitutional Commander in 
Chief, why did he do nothing to send 
help to our overwhelmed and besieged 
law enforcement officers for at least 2 
hours on January 6 after the attack 
began? 
On January 6, why did President 
Trump not at any point that day con-
demn the violent insurrection and the 
insurrectionists? 
And I will add a legal question that I 
hope his distinguished counsel will ad-
dress: If a President did invite a violent 
insurrection against our government, 
as, of course, we allege and think we 
have proven in this case—but just in 
general, if a President incited a violent 
insurrection against our government— 
would that be a high crime and mis-
demeanor? Can we all agree, at least, 
on that? 
Senators, I have talked a lot about 
common sense in this trial because I 
think, I believe that is all you need to 
arrive at the right answer here. 
You know, when Tom Paine wrote 
‘‘Common Sense,’’ the pamphlet that 
launched the American Revolution, he 
said that common sense really meant 
two different things: 
One, common sense is the under-
standing that we all have without ad-
vanced learning and education. Com-
mon sense is the sense accessible to ev-
erybody. But common sense is also the 
sense that we all have in common, as a 
community. 
Senators, America, we need to exer-
cise our common sense about what hap-
pened. Let’s not get caught up in a lot 
of outlandish lawyers’ theories here. 
Exercise your common sense about 
what just took place in our country. 
Tom Paine wasn’t an American, as 
you know, but he came over to help us 
in our great revolutionary struggle 
against the Kings and Queens and the 
tyrants. And in 1776, in ‘‘The Crisis,’’ 
he wrote these beautiful words. It was 
a very tough time for the country. Peo-
ple didn’t know which way things were 
going to go. Were we going to win, 
against all hope, because for most of 
the rest of human history it had been 
the Kings and the Queens and the ty-
rants and the nobles lording it over the 
common people? Could political self- 
government work in America was the 
question. And Paine wrote this pam-
phlet called ‘‘The Crisis,’’ and in it he 
said these beautiful words. And, with 
your permission, I’m going to update 
the language a little bit, pursuant to 
the suggestion of Speaker PELOSI, so as 
not to offend modern sensibilities. OK. 
But he said: These are the times that 
try men and women’s souls. These are 
the times that try men and women’s 
souls. The summer soldier and the sun-
shine patriot will shrink at this mo-
ment from the service of their cause 
and their country; but everyone who 
stands with us now will win the love 
and the favor and the affection of every 
man and every woman for all time. 
Tyranny, like hell, is not easily con-
quered, but we have this saving con-
solation: The more difficult the strug-
gle, the more glorious, in the end, will 
be our victory. 
Good luck in your deliberations. 
We do conclude our presentation. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you. Thank 
you. Now, I have two—we are going to 
do the adjournment resolution in a mo-
ment. I have two other things that we 
have to do. They are quick. 
First, Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that it be in order to 
make several unanimous consent re-
quests as if in legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that on Friday, 
February 12, from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. 
that, 
notwithstanding 
adjournment, 
the Senate be able to receive House 
messages and executive matters, com-
mittees be authorized to report legisla-
tive and executive matters, and Sen-
ators be allowed to submit statements 
for the record, introduce bills and reso-
lutions, and make cosponsor requests, 
and, where applicable, the Secretary of 
the Senate, on behalf of the Presiding 
Officer, be permitted to refer such mat-
ters. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—READING OF 
WASHINGTON’S FAREWELL ADDRESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. And a second re-
quest, poignantly appropriate at this 
moment: I ask unanimous consent 
that, pursuant to the order of the Sen-
ate of January 24, 1901, the traditional 
reading of Washington’s Farewell Ad-
dress take place on Monday, February

ROE V. WADE 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as a physician who has held 20- 
week-old babies in my hand, it floors me to 
think that some do not feel they are worthy of 
life. Who knows how many future movie stars, 
professional athletes, or even members of 
Congress never got their chance to shine be-
cause they were believed to only be ‘‘a clump 
of cells.’’ 
Abortion activists always deflect with the 
line: ‘‘not your body, not your choice.’’ Dye 
their hair green, pierce their lip, tattoo their 
tongue, the whole nine yards. That’s their pre-
rogative. A developing person is NOT a body 
part. A baby is its own completely separate 
entity. They have unique DNA. They have a 
unique future awaiting them. Nobody has the 
right to kill it. 
Of course, pregnancies are absolutely dif-
ficult on women. I’ve watched my wife go 
through three of them. But what is more im-
portant? Opting out of a difficult 9 months? Or, 
on average, the 80 years of human life that re-
sult from that pregnancy? 
One argument you frequently hear is that 
it’s cruel for babies to be born into a world of 
poverty, so they’re better off dead. This is 
such a sad argument. Life can be difficult, no 
doubt, being born into poverty, but life also of-
fers endless opportunities for success. How 
can anyone deprive someone of their chance 
to succeed and experience life? 
As science continues to progress and we 
learn more and more about babies in the early 
stages of pregnancy, it’s my hope that people 
will finally come around to see their humanity. 
I pledge to continue fighting until that day 
comes and this evil is rooted out of our nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF JEROME 
KATER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Jerome Kater 
of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, who recently 
received the Jefferson Award from CBS 21 
News. 
As president of the board at Katie’s Place, 
Mr. Kater has worked tirelessly to devote his 
time and resources to helping the people of 
Shippensburg. Under his leadership, Katie’s 
Place serves as a distribution site for chari-
table goods and services. For his community 
efforts, Mr. Kater received the 8 Who Cares 
Award in November—another testament to his 
spirit of service. In addition to his volunteer 
work, Mr. Kater also serves as a member of 
the Shippensburg University Police Depart-
ment. Through it all, he credits God with giving 
him a heart for service. 
Jerome Kater is a selfless leader and ex-
ceptional role model. On behalf of the 13th 
District of Pennsylvania, I thank Mr. Kater for 
his service to the Shippensburg community, 
and I congratulate him and his family on this 
remarkable honor.

RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF THES-

TROUPE 
6803 
AT 
BORDENTOWN HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Thespian Troupe 6803 at 
Bordentown High School for their exceptional 
service to New Jersey and their community. 
Amid a global crisis, the students of Thes-
pian Troupe 6803 at Bordentown High School 
revitalized the discontinued Trick or Treat So 
Kids Can Eat program and became true lead-
ers. In response to the hunger they witnessed 
in their community, Thespian Troupe 6803 
raised over 615 pounds of food for the St. 
Mary’s Food Pantry as part of the Trick or 
Treat so Kids Can Eat Program. 
In this time, where a growing number of 
New Jersey residents are going to bed hun-
gry, we should be doing all we can to ensure 
that we feed those in need. Thespian Troupe 
6803’s work exemplifies the best of New Jer-
sey and New Jersey’s compassion for all of its 
citizens. 
I could not be prouder of the students in this 
troupe, and I thank them for their service.

RECOGNIZING RICHMOND HILL 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Ford Avenue His-
toric District as an officially designated area in 
the city of Richmond Hill. 
After 2 years of planning, the Richmond Hill 
City Council approved an amendment to an 
ordinance creating the city’s first historic dis-
trict on January 5th. 
The Ford Avenue Historic District is at the 
heart of Richmond Hill’s history and contains 
primary locations and buildings Ford Motor 
Company built between 1925 and 1947. When 
Henry Ford came to Richmond Hill, the town 
was known as Ways Station. Upon his arrival, 
the town grew and became known as Rich-
mond Hill. You can feel the history simply 
walking down the street. 
Designating this remarkable historic district 
is just another positive effort by the city to pro-
mote, protect, and remember its roots. I am 
thankful for the Richmond Hill City Council’s 
diligent work on this and everything they do.

MARSHALL PLAN FOR MOMS 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with a desperate cry for help and a call to ac-
tion for the millions of moms who have been 
pushed to the brink of economic, social, and 
emotional disaster due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Since the start of the pandemic, 
moms—especially moms of color—have been 
facing the brunt of the economic fall out of this 
pandemic as a result of existing social barriers 
and policy failures that have been com-
pounded by enduring racism and gender injus-
tices. 
What a year can do. At the beginning of 
2020, even in the face of continued gender 
and racial wage gaps, women made up the 
majority of the workforce for the first time in al-
most a decade. A year later, women have lost 
over 5.4 million net jobs and account for 55 
percent of overall net job loss since the start 
of the pandemic. Today, there are over 2 mil-
lion fewer women in the labor force than there 
were before the pandemic. The pandemic has 
triggered a financial and emotional calamity for 
America’s moms, who are shouldering the ma-
jority of child care, domestic work, and remote 
school responsibilities—and this against the 
backdrop of women who were already over-
represented in low-wage jobs and underrep-
resented in high-wage jobs. 
We know that mother’s wages are key to 
their families’ economic security and survival, 
even as they are leaving the workforce in 
droves or are reducing work hours—otherwise 
known as the ‘‘she-cession’’. American moms 
are breadwinners in nearly half of families with 
children under 18, and yet the wage gap for 
moms is larger than for women overall, such 
that moms with full-time, year-round jobs are 
paid 70 cents for every dollar paid to dads. 
Adding to the tragedy is that moms perma-
nently leaving the workforce are disrupting 
their career trajectory and endangering their 
future Social Security earnings and other po-
tential retirement income. Furthermore, child 
nutrition is inextricably linked to mothers in the 
workforce, such that almost one in four chil-
dren experienced food insecurity in 2020. This 
is a moral failure. 
Madam Speaker, moms are screaming out 
for help. I hear constantly from other moms 
that this is just not sustainable. The unprece-
dented burdens of child care, work, remote 
learning—on top of the social isolation—have 
strained the mental and emotional health of 
moms. As a mom of two young boys, this 
issue is especially personal to me. Moms ev-
erywhere are saying: something has to give, 
before something ultimately breaks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E124 
February 11, 2021 
That is why I am introducing the Marshall 
Plan for Moms to revitalize and restore moms 
in the workforce. After all, any meaningful and 
sustainable economic recovery from this pan-
demic must recognize and rebuild moms in 
the labor force. As such, the Marshall Plan 
calls for robust paid leave; saving our child 
care industry, with a vision toward universal 
child care and early learning; investment in 
our education system, including broadband 
connections; strengthening child poverty tools, 
such as child tax credit and earned income tax 
credit; expanded unemployment insurance 
benefits; strong SNAP benefits; federal min-
imum wage increase to $15; and mental 
health support for moms. 
We need a Marshall Plan for Moms be-
cause we need transformational structural 
change. Moms, especially moms of color, 
were already fighting an uphill battle against 
societal norms and economic injustices. They 
are hurting today, because, like so many other 
things, this pandemic has exacerbated already 
existing injustices and inequities. 
Madam Speaker, as you have always said: 
When Women Succeed, America Succeeds. 
For the sake of our economy, we must 
prioritize addressing this precipice facing 
moms and immediately implement the Mar-
shall Plan for Moms, so that moms have a 
fighting chance, and that they are protected 
against any future economic calamities. I urge 
all my colleagues to support this legislation.

REMEMBERING AND HONORING 
OFFICER BRIAN SICKNICK 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor Officer 
Brian Sicknick, who tragically passed away 
from the injuries he sustained from the U.S. 
Capitol riots on January 6th. 
Officer Sicknick was a New Jersey native 
who joined the Capitol Police in 2008 after 
serving in the New Jersey Air National Guard. 
He went through two different deployments 
and supported our country during the war in 
Afghanistan until he was honorably dis-
charged. 
Officer Sicknick’s family said he wanted to 
be a police officer his entire life and joined the 
Air National Guard as a means to that end. 
He is a hero who will be remembered by his 
untethered commitment to protecting all those 
within and around the hallowed halls of Con-
gress. 
I am thankful for Officer Sicknick’s legacy, 
and my thoughts and prayers go out to his 
family, friends, the Capitol Police, and all who 
knew him during this most difficult time.

RECOGNITION OF COOKIES FOR 
CAREGIVERS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize Scott McKenzie and Jer-
emy Ulbricht of Huntingdon County, Pennsyl-
vania for starting the Cookies for Caregivers 
movement. 
In the early days of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, a friendly competition between the two 
resulted in a cookie baking contest judged by 
the Mayor of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. After 
the competition was over, they took leftover 
cookies to the Huntingdon Police Department 
to thank the first responders. The gratitude the 
officers expressed inspired Scott and Jeremy 
to begin recruiting other members of the com-
munity to bake cookies for other essential 
workers. 
Since then, Scott and Jeremy’s group has 
baked more than 18,000 cookies. Their 
Facebook page, ‘‘Cookies for Caregivers,’’ has 
more than a thousand members. Additionally, 
23 similar groups have been started across 
the United States. 
While our first responders endure to combat 
the COVID–19 pandemic, it is encouraging to 
see southcentral Pennsylvanians express grat-
itude to our community’s essential workers. As 
Scott and Jeremy continue to offer encourage-
ment to those on the frontlines of the fight 
against COVID–19, I wish them and their 
movement every continued success.

HONORING WELLS COUNTY WORLD 
WAR II VETERAN ED GOETZ 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service of Mr. Ed Goetz of Wells 
County. 
Next week, on Monday, February 15, Mr. 
Goetz will celebrate his 100th birthday. Con-
gratulations Mr. Goetz on this wonderful occa-
sion. I hope his heart is filled with joy knowing 
that he has experienced our country’s greatest 
blessings, including the affection of family and 
friends over a long, well-lived life. 
Our Nation owes Mr. Goetz a debt of grati-
tude for his dedicated service to our country 
while serving in the United States Army during 
World War II. As a flight engineer stationed in 
the South Pacific, Goetz flew a total of 37 
combat missions over Japan, including one 
during which the crew was forced to crash 
land in the middle of the ocean. 
In 1964, Goetz moved to Bluffton, where he 
became active in his church and the Boy 
Scouts. Goetz served on the boards of the 
United Way and The Wells County Founda-
tion, helped provide income tax preparation for 
over 25 years, served as the treasurer for 
Friends of the Library for nearly 30 years, and 
worked to fill the Ossian Industrial Park with 
hundreds of jobs. In 2010, at age 90, Goetz 
was named the Wells County Citizen of the 
Year. 
The story of Ed Goetz is the story of Amer-
ican greatness. As a patriot who served his 
country in war and community in peace, this 
honor is a testament to his commitment to the 
American people and ideals to which our Na-
tion strive.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
JOANN 
GONYEA’S 35 YEARS OF SERVICE 
TO THE CITY OF TRENTON 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Joann Gonyea on the oc-
casion of her retirement after nearly 35 years 
of service to the City of Trenton, Michigan. 
Her significant contributions to the Trenton 
community is worthy of commendation. 
Ms. Gonyea grew up on the east side of 
Detroit, Michigan. Later attending Wayne State 
University and graduating with a degree in 
Recreation and Parks Services. In 1985, she 
was introduced to the City of Trenton as an in-
tern with the Wayne County park system. She 
was hired to the City of Trenton’s Parks and 
Recreation team, eventually rising to the posi-
tion of Director of Parks and Recreation. 
During her time as Director, she has broken 
ground on numerous projects. She was a crit-
ical partner in the development and opening of 
the Refuge Gateway of Detroit River Inter-
national Wildlife Refuge, the only International 
Wildlife Refuge in North America. As a leader 
in the Downriver Linked Greenways project, 
she helped build a trail to connect the wildlife 
refuge with the downriver linked greenways. 
Ms. Gonyea is leaving a legacy of successful 
revitalization projects and has helped the city 
of Trenton earn the title of ‘‘trail town.’’ 
The parks, trails, and greenways she has 
helped develop have transformed the 12th 
District and will have a lasting impact on the 
health and wellbeing of its residents. Her work 
has been vital in promoting a healthy and sus-
tainable lifestyle. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Joann Gonyea for her exem-
plary 35 years of public service. She has ef-
fectively served Trenton and the State of 
Michigan in her role as Parks and Recreation 
Director through her selflessness and dedica-
tion to the community. I join with Joann’s fam-
ily, friends, and colleagues in extending my 
best wishes to her in retirement.

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor Betty 
Miner of Richmond Hill who sadly passed 
away at the age of 87. 
Betty lived a remarkable life and touched 
countless lives. She was a lifelong resident of 
Richmond Hill and became the first woman 
councilmember for the city in 1971. 
Betty also served as mayor pro-tem. In ad-
dition to her work to lead and improve Rich-
mond Hill, she served on the DNR board for 
the state of Georgia through which she was 
instrumental in bringing the fisherman’s co-op 
to Bryan County. Through every position she 
had, she worked to better her community and 
every life she touched. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to her fam-
ily, friends, and all who knew her during this 
most difficult time.

ICE TO VIRGINIA’S FIRST CON-
GRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jacob Miller for his service 
to Virginia’s First Congressional District. Since 
joining my D.C. Staff in June 2019, Jacob has 
served a crucial role on my communications 
team. Jacob’s dedication to delivering timely 
and helpful information to constituents is com-
mendable and I am thankful for his tireless ef-
forts for Virginia’s First District. 
Since the beginning of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, my office has made it a priority to send 
constituents the most up to date information 
on COVID–19 resources and relief. Jacob has 
been at the forefront of that effort since the 
very beginning. Jacob’s thoughtfulness and 
strong work ethic has directly impacted con-
stituents in Virginia’s First District. Whether it 
was about CDC guidelines, information on 
testing, local and federal resources, all the 
way up to the most recent vaccine information, 
Jacob was a leader in providing this crucial in-
formation to constituents 
Jacob has a strong passion for history, a 
passion we both share. He is a gifted writer 
that sets him apart in the way he commu-
nicates to others. He has a notable ability to 
deliver complex information in a timely and un-
derstandable manner. Jacob is also a friend to 
all—he was always quick to help others in the 
office when needed and lend his thoughtful in-
sight to any given task. Jacob has contributed 
to the office and my staff in a significant way, 
and he will be greatly missed. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me today to recognize Jacob Miller 
and his dedication to the constituents of Vir-
ginia’s First District. Jacob has bright future, 
and I wish him the best of luck on his future 
journey and career.

HONORING ELIZABETH YOTHERS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Elizabeth Yothers on 
becoming one of the first young women in the 
Westmoreland-Fayette Council Boy Scouts of 
America to achieve the position of Eagle 
Scout. 
Elizabeth joined the Boy Scouts in 2019 
when girls were first able to join. She was one 
of the founding members of Troop 1372, 
which is partnered with the all-male Troop 
372. She first began her goal of becoming an 
Eagle Scout while in her senior year at Great-
er Latrobe High School and finished while at-
tending Westmoreland County Community 
College. 
In her journey to become an Eagle Scout, 
Elizabeth earned 31 merit badges, 10 more 
than the 21 required. For her Eagle Scout 
project, she planted grass, removed weeds, 
cleared gravel, and other tasks at the West-
moreland Cleanways Recycling Center in 
Unity. 
Elizabeth already is giving back to the Boy 
Scouts of America and her community by 
serving as an assistant Scoutmaster. On be-
half of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional Dis-
trict, I congratulate Elizabeth Yothers on her 
trailblazing achievement and wish her all the 
best in the chapters to come.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE HEROIC 
EFFORTS 
OF 
THE 
STURGEON 
BAY FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the heroic efforts of the Stur-
geon Bay Fire Department. In the early hours 
of February 1st, a bulk carrier ship holding fuel 
and docked for the winter, the M/V Roger 
Blough, caught fire. Over 100 Sturgeon Bay 
firefighters battled the blaze for hours, using 
1.4 million gallons of water to extinguish the 
fire. Their bravery and skill ultimately lead to 
no deaths, no injuries, no fuel discharged, and 
minimal damage to the ship. These brave men 
and women deserve our thanks and gratitude, 
and have served Northeast Wisconsin excep-
tionally well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in applauding the Sturgeon 
Bay Fire Department for their service and 
bravery on February 1st.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
PHARMACIST DAY 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize National Pharmacist 
Day, which takes place on January 12th annu-
ally to recognize and honor pharmacists 
across the nation. As a pharmacist myself, I 
thoroughly understand the role each phar-
macist plays as an integrated member of the 
health care team. Every day, pharmacists are 
directly involved in patient care and phar-
macists are the most accessible health care 
professionals in the country. 95 percent of 
Americans live within five miles of a phar-
macy. 
As we battle COVID–19, pharmacists should 
be recognized as they are on the frontlines 
dispensing the vaccine. Because of their work, 
lives will be saved. They’ve been vital re-
sources throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, 
and they will continue to play an active role in 
combatting the virus. 
I ask that you join me in recognizing all 
pharmacists by thanking them for their work. 
IN RECOGNITION OF ABENA 
HOGAN 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of the many outstanding contribu-
tions to the communities of Wayne County in 
Michigan’s 13th Congressional District of 
Abena Hogan, as we honor her memory. 
Born and raised in Detroit, Ms. Hogan was 
a proud daughter of her community. She 
began her first career in public service working 
for southeast Michigan’s regional public transit 
system S. After 20 years of service, Ms. 
Hogan briefly retired before she was called 
back into serving the public once again, as the 
Community Relations Liaison to the Wayne 
County Clerk. 
Ms. Hogan took immense pride in serving 
the people of Wayne County. She was an ac-
tive member of countless community organiza-
tions, serving as a board member and as a 
volunteer, including the NAACP and Barton 
McFarland Community Council. Ms. Hogan 
believed deeply in the power of the people 
and grassroots action. She engaged people, 
young and old, on the importance of being in-
volved and taking action. 
Ms. Hogan was well-known for her bound-
less energy, willingness to always lend a hand 
to someone in need, and commitment to im-
proving the quality of life for all community 
members. Ms. Hogan was affectionately called 
‘‘Queen Abena’’ because of her commanding, 
yet loving presence. She was a true public 
servant and will truly be missed. 
Please join me and ‘‘Smile! One more time!’’ 
as Abena Hogan always said, as we pay trib-
ute to her memory and recognize her hard 
work on behalf of the communities of Detroit, 
Wayne County, and Michigan’s 13th Congres-
sional District.

LUNAR NEW YEAR 2021 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the cultural and historical signifi-
cance of Lunar New Year in 2021, the Year of 
the Ox. This year, Lunar New Year officially 
begins on February 12th. 
With the continued expansion of Asian dias-
pora, Lunar New Year is now observed by mil-
lions of Asian Americans and by many non- 
Asian Americans in the United States. Lunar 
New Year is traditionally a time to wish upon 
others good fortune, health, prosperity, and 
happiness. It is a special time for families to 
come together and celebrate the occasion with 
community activities and cultural perform-
ances. Having lots of delicious food is a major 
part of New Year festivities. A dish my family 
traditionally enjoys is noodle soup, which 
brings luck for the year ahead. 
Of course, this year’s celebration is very dif-
ferent from all the previous celebrations. Due 
to the pandemic, there will be less in-person 
celebrations—whether with our families or 
within our communities. But I still hope that we

Madam Speaker, every year since I have 
been a member of Congress, I have intro-
duced legislation to recognize the significance 
of Lunar New Year. I am proud to be joined 
by 61 fellow Representatives in today’s intro-
duction of this resolution to recognize the cul-
tural and historical significance of the holiday. 
I believe Lunar New Year is not only about 
recognizing the many contributions the Asian 
American community has made, and con-
tinues to make, but also about honoring and 
acknowledging that our nation’s strength lies 
in its diversity. I wish everyone a very Happy 
Lunar New Year. And Happy Year of the Ox.

TAYLOR 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Kalli Taylor of Bed-
ford, Pennsylvania, for her selection to partici-
pate in the National Association of Music Edu-
cation’s 2021 All-Eastern Honor Ensembles as 
a member of the Treble Chorus. 
The Treble Chorus is comprised of 120 
members from nine states. Kalli was selected 
from a poll of more than 1,000 applicants to 
participate—a testament to her outstanding 
musical talent. As a student at Bedford Area 
High School, she has demonstrated a strong 
commitment to music. She is a member of 
Varsity Singers, the school’s select choir, and 
has starred in three school musicals. 
Kalli’s dedication to music demonstrates her 
commitment to hard work, determination, and 
dedication. I congratulate Kalli on her selection 
for the Treble Chorus and wish her every con-
tinued success.

HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER

Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor a great 
Georgian and American. William, or ‘‘Will,’’ 
Howard Ingram the second of Richmond Hill 
tragically passed away at the age of 43. Will 
lived a successful life and began his career in 
the military after remarkably receiving appoint-
ments to all three of the United States Service 
Academies. He was a 1999 graduate of West 
Point. 
After he honorably served his country as an 
Army officer, Will went on to earn a graduate 
degree from the University of Washington. 
Following his active duty service, he went 
on to serve his country as an Army Civilian for 
over fifteen years. 
During that time, he served as the Chief of 
Master Planning for the Army’s Third Infantry 
Division for several years before he took on 
responsibilities as the Chief of Operations and 
Maintenance at Fort Stewart and Hunter Army 
Airfield. 
Among all his many accomplishments, Will 
was most proud of his son, Gabe. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his family, 
friends, and all who knew him during this most 
difficult time.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF KAREN LEWIS 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate and celebrate the life of a fierce 
and unyielding champion of Chicago’s stu-
dents, Karen Lewis. 
A native of Chicago’s South Side and 
daughter of Chicago Public School teachers, 
Lewis attended Chicago Public Schools until 
her early admission to Mount Holyoke College 
in Massachusetts. Lewis would then make his-
tory at an early age, when she transferred to 
Dartmouth College and was the only African- 
American woman in her 1974 graduating 
class. 
Returning to Chicago soon after her gradua-
tion from Dartmouth, Lewis began as a sub-
stitute chemistry teacher for Chicago Public 
Schools. Her intellect and commitment to her 
students earned Lewis a full-time teaching 
role, which she would hold for nearly two dec-
ades, enriching the lives and minds of stu-
dents across the city. During her time as a 
chemistry teacher, Lewis taught at Lane Tech 
College Prep, Sullivan High School, and finally 
King College Prep in the Kenwood neighbor-
hood, just blocks from her childhood home. 
By 2008, Lewis had become a union dele-
gate, bringing her energy and grit to the fight 
against school closures that would affect some 
of Chicago’s most vulnerable students. Real-
izing that teachers and students faced increas-
ing class sizes, school closures, and a budget 
crisis, Lewis put her bold vision forward and 
became the president of the Chicago Teach-
er’s Union in 2010. In the face of many in Chi-
cago’s power structure calling for schools to 
be closed and protections to be stripped from 
dedicated educators, Lewis powerfully put for-
ward a new vision for the city’s public school, 
entitled The Schools Chicago’s Students De-
serve. With this vision, Lewis sought to narrow 
the often vast differences between what Chi-
cago’s teachers and students needed to be 
successful and what they actually received 
from Chicago Public Schools. 
Madam Speaker, in September 2012, Karen 
Lewis rose to national prominence when she 
led the first teacher’s strike in Chicago in a 
quarter century. Tackling a new mayoral ad-
ministration that sought to lay off teachers in 
exchange for raises, Lewis led a labor move-
ment whose tactics would be studied around 
the country as a model for successful orga-
nized labor. The nine days Karen Lewis led 
the Chicago Teachers Union on strike were in-
strumental in winning concessions that in-
cluded a robust pay raise and fairer evaluation 
of classroom performance. The next year, 
teachers in Los Angeles used the tactics pio-
neered by Lewis to gain critical concessions 
from the city for their students and teachers. 
In 2018, West Virginia teachers used the 
Lewis play book during their strike. The 2012 
Chicago teachers’ strike has been described 
as having ‘‘changed the future of organizing.’’ 
So great was the appreciation of Lewis’s 
bold and unrelenting fight for Chicago’s teach-
ers and students that many in the city believed 
that she would make an exceptional mayor. 
Sadly, in 2014, Lewis received the life-altering 
diagnosis of glioblastoma, an aggressive type 
of brain cancer. True to the fighter she was, 
Lewis carried on her fearless advocacy after 
her diagnosis, continuing on as president of 
the Chicago Teacher’s Union until 2018. 
Madam Speaker, Karen Lewis passed away 
on February 7th at the age of 67. With her 
death, Chicago and the nation have lost an 
icon and a treasure. My deepest sympathies 
lie with her husband, John, and all of her 
close family and friends during this challenging 
time.

IN HONOR OF TRIPP HOGG 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness that I rise today in honor of 
Tripp Hogg, who recently passed away. Tripp 
will be profoundly missed by his family, 
friends, and community, but his memory will 
live on for many years to come. 
Tripp was born on January 15, 1969, in 
Richmond, Virginia. He attended Lee Davis 
Highschool, where he graduated in 1987. 
Tripp graduated from East Carolina University 
in 1991, where he was a member of Sigma 
Phi Epsilon and the President of his Senior 
Class. Upon graduation from ECU, Tripp en-
tered the Real Estate business in 1991 and 
joined his family’s business, ERA Woody 
Hogg & Associates. 
Tripp has three children, Oakleigh, Delaney, 
and Elle Hogg; as well as three stepchildren, 
Mary Beth, Mandy, and Josh Ratchford. Tripp 
is also survived by his beloved wife, Kathie 
White Hogg; his sister, Elizabeth Hogg; and 
his brother, Jonathan Hogg; as well as his fa-
ther, O Woodland ‘‘Woody’’ Hogg, Jr. (Pamela 
Hogg); and his mother, Susan U. Hogg. 
Tripp was an extraordinarily caring person 
who loved his family dearly, as well as his 
community, Commonwealth, and our Nation. I 
fondly remember the conversations we would 
have when we saw each other in the home 
improvement stores in the Mechanicsville 
area. He always began our conversations ask-
ing me how I was doing. I had the honor of 
hosting Tripp and his family on a personally 
guided tour of the U.S. Capitol and I will treas-
ure that memory forever. 
Tripp was always very active in his commu-
nity, church, and profession. He consistently 
ranked in the top 1 percent of all salespeople 
both locally and nationally. Tripp was also an 
avid fisherman and loved everything with salt 
water. Tripp’s passion for service to those 
around him will be greatly missed by all who 
knew and loved him. I pray that God may 
bring peace to Tripp’s friends and family as 
they grieve his loss, and that they may be 
comforted and reminded of their fond memo-
ries of Tripp during this time. Therefore, 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you rise with me 
today in remembrance of and to honor the life 
of Tripp Hogg.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
SERGEANT JAMES COOK 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to ask my colleagues to honor the 
life of Sergeant James Cook, who was trag-
ically killed while serving as a security guard 
at the MetroLink Delmar station. This is espe-
cially heartbreaking as James leaves behind a 
wife and two young daughters. Along with 
being a husband and father, James was a vet-
eran who served this country bravely for eight 
years in combat in Afghanistan and Africa. 
After his service, James would carry on his 
service to the community by continuing his 
work in law enforcement as a jailer in 
Crawford County. It is always a tragedy when 
a hero like James is taken. We must continue 
to honor him by living in service to others just 
as James did during his life. He will always be 
remembered for his sacrifices to his nation 
and his love for his family. I thank him for his 
service, and I wish my most sincere blessings 
to his family. May he now peacefully rest with 
God and watch down upon his wife and 
daughters as they live life in his honor. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the life of Sergeant James Cook.

NINTH ANNUAL NATIONAL COURT 
REPORTING 
AND 
CAPTIONING 
WEEK 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the impor-
tant and irreplaceable work done by our court 
reporters and the National Court Reporters 
Association (NCRA) during the 9th annual na-
tional court reporting and captioning week of 
February 6–13. 
As guardians of the record, court reporters 
have a large impact on capturing history for 
posterity. During our nearly 250 years of 
American history, court reporters have been 
the cornerstone of our American justice sys-
tem. From George Washington’s Farewell Ad-
dress to Lincoln’s divided house speech, these 
noble servants have transcribed some of the 
most important pieces of American history. 
Today, the NCRA provides a free course to 
introduce realtime writing to all Americans. 
This course allows high schoolers, career 
changers, college redirects, and military vet-
erans to see if a profession in realtime writing 
is a good fit for them. 
Additionally, due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, it’s important we focus on providing 
flexibility to our court reporters and ensuring 
captions are adhering to the FCC’ s Caption 
Quality Best Practices—as opposed to Auto-
matic Speech Recognition, which oftentimes 
creates erroneous captions. 
I want to thank realtime writers everywhere 
and the NCRA for all the hard work they do.

nounce that Ms. Little was selected as the 
2021–2021 Outstanding Educator of the Year

Amid a global crisis, while leading a state- 
wide organization and serving as teacher for 
her students and two young daughters, Ms. 
Little continuously put the needs of her stu-
dents and the less fortunate ahead of herself. 
While serving as a mentor to her students dur-
ing this tough time, Ms. Little helped lead 
Toms River Thespian Troupe 7455 in their 
Trick or Treat so Kids Can Eat Program. With 
the help of Ms. Little, Toms River Thespian

raised over 547 pounds of food for the 
Thanksgiving Food Drive. 
I could not be prouder of Ms. Little and I

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize an amazing public 
servant. 
The City Clerk of Hinesville, Sarah Lumpkin, 
is retiring after over 3 decades of service in 
local government. 
Sarah began her career with the City of 
Hinesville when she joined the City team as 
an Accounts Payable Clerk and rose to the 
rank of Assistant City Clerk by 1991. 
Throughout her career, she accumulated a 
long list of awards and accomplishments in-
cluding being named the first recipient of the 
Hinesville City Hall Employee of the Year 
Award in 1994 and being designated ‘‘Certified 
Municipal Clerk’’ by the International Institute 
of Municipal Clerks in 1996. 
She took her leadership skills to new 
heights when she served as President of the 
Georgia Municipal Clerks and Finance Offi-
cer’s Association of the State of Georgia from 
2006 to 2007. Sarah’s guidance and expertise 
throughout her career paved the way for tre-
mendous growth and success for the city of 
Hinesville, and I am very grateful for all she 
accomplished. 
I wish her the best of luck as she begins her

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

Guard as this treasured organization marks 75 
years of service to the Bedford County com-
munity. 
The Fort Bedford Honor Guard, which is be-
lieved to be one of the longest-serving all-vol-
unteer veteran honor guards in the nation,

sell, Kappa Rho Zeta Chapter of Zeta Phi 
Beta sorority was founded with the purpose of 
upholding the tenets of sisterhood, service, 
and scholarship. Over the past 40 years, the 
sisters of Kappa Rho Zeta have given count-
less hours of community service to the people 
of Highland Park. Their service and charitable 
work has extended to several locally-based or-
ganizations, including the Agape of Hartford 
Memorial Baptist Church, Coalition of Tem-
porary Shelter (COTS), Highland Park Lions 
Club, Park Geriatric Village, the Children’s 
Center, Detroit Goodfellows, the Boys & Girls 
Club of Highland Park, and Detroit Rescue 
Mission Ministries in Highland Park. They 
spear-head the annual holiday celebration for 
the seniors of Highland Park. Kappa Rho Zeta 
Chapter also opened two Stork’s Nest loca-
tions in the community to provide workshops 
and assistance for pregnant mothers. And, in 
the tradition of scholarship of Zeta Phi Beta, 
uplift the graduating high school students of

COVID–19 LANGUAGE ACCESS ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, with over 25 
million people across our nation who have lim-
ited English proficiency, there is a critical need 
for translated COVID–19 outreach materials 
during this pandemic response. 
We must ensure language barriers do not 
prevent individuals from accessing vital and 
potentially lifesaving COVID–19 information, 
especially as our federal, state, and local gov-
ernments are working to get every single indi-
vidual in the United States vaccinated. 
Madam Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has 
exacerbated 
already 
existing 
vulnerabilities, inequalities, and disparities, 
particularly in access to health care. Inad-
equate access to health care for reasons such 
as language barriers increases health dispari-
ties among vulnerable populations, especially 
those of communities of color. 
Health disparities are often magnified for in-
dividuals who have limited English proficiency. 
For weeks after the COVID–19 public health 
emergency was declared, the government pro-
vided little to no information about COVID in 
languages other than English and Spanish, 
which left millions of people in the dark. No 
one should be left in the dark. 
That is why I am re-introducing the COVID– 
19 Language Access Act, which would require 
any federal agency that receives coronavirus- 
related funding to provide COVID–19 written 
resources to the public in 20 languages: Span-
ish, Arabic, Cambodian, Chinese, Haitian Cre-
ole, French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, 
Russian, Tagalog, Urdu, Vietnamese, Greek, 
Polish, Thai, Portuguese, Laotian, and Hmong. 
These selected languages are based on the 
languages required in the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency’s Language Access Plan 
for Disaster Assistance dated October 1, 
2016. And Hmong has been added to reflect 
existing federal standards, including at Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, for requiring 
Hmong translations in addition to Laotian. 
I am proud that my bill has served as a 
basis for President Biden’s presidential memo-
randum to address cultural and linguistic bar-
riers to COVID–19 relief and recovery, espe-
cially for Asian Americans. President Biden’s 
executive actions underscores the inequities of 
language access particularly in the midst of 
this COVID–19 outbreak. 
Madam Speaker, fighting this pandemic re-
quires everyone to have the right information 
and to be vaccinated. But to do so, we must 
eliminate any language barrier so that every-
one is best prepared, informed, and ready to 
defeat this pandemic together. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation.

rural, northeastern Kentucky. 
Sherry’s love for northeastern Kentucky has 
been evident in her tireless dedication and ad-
amant advocacy to strengthen communities in 
Boyd, Carter, Elliott, Greenup and Lawrence 
counties for nearly four decades through her 
leadership at the FIVCO ADD and the FIVCO 
Service Agency. In addition to being a staunch 
advocate for economic development and infra-
structure enhancement in Kentucky’s Appa-
lachian region, Sherry has been an organiza-
tional powerhouse, cultivating unlikely partner-
ships and rallying volunteers from across 
county-lines to meet the needs of our people. 
Whether distributing food commodities, caring 
for our elderly residents, or extending water 
and sewer service in our communities, Sherry 
filled the gap on many occasions and was the 
glue that held multiple programs together 
across the local, state, and federal levels. 
Sherry is the type of leader that accepts every 
challenge and surpasses every expectation for 
the good of the people around her. 
When we examine the growth and progress 
in the FIVCO region over the last 38 years, we 
can see the influence of Sherry’s astute busi-
ness sense and her unmatched work ethic. Al-
though she is retiring, Sherry should be proud 
of the firm foundation that she has laid for the 
next generation to build upon. She has made 
a resounding difference in our part of Ken-
tucky. 
In closing, I want to express my deep ap-
preciation for Sherry’s service to the people of 
northeastern Kentucky, her leadership and her 
assistance for our local leaders in the FIVCO 
region. It has been an honor to work alongside 
such an inspiring advocate for our commu-
nities. I wish Sherry and her family tremen-
dous joy and blessings in the years to come.

RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF THES-
PIAN TROUPE 1555 AT RANCOCAS 
VALLEY 
REGIONAL 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Thespian Troupe 1555 at 
Rancocas Valley Regional High School for 
their exceptional service to New Jersey and 
their community. 
Amid a global crisis, the students of Thes-
pian Troupe 1555 at Rancocas Valley Re-
gional High School revitalized the discontinued 
Trick or Treat So Kids Can Eat program and 
became true leaders. In response to the hun-
ger they witnessed in their community, Thes-
pian Troupe 1555 raised over 90 pounds of 
food for the RVRHS Food Pantry as part of 
the Trick or Treat So Kids Can Eat program. 
In this time, where a growing number of 
New Jersey residents are going to bed hun-
gry, we should be doing all we can to ensure 
that we feed those in need. Thespian Troupe 
1555’s work exemplifies the best of New Jer-
sey and New Jersey’s compassion for all of its 
citizens. 
I could not be prouder of the students in this 
troupe, and I thank them for their service. 
IN MEMORY OF DR. ALAN GREEN 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and remember the life of Dr. Alan 
Green, the esteemed former Chair of the De-
partment of Psychiatry at Dartmouth College’s 
Geisel School of Medicine. Dr. Green radiated 
resilience, energy, and a joy for life that car-
ried him through both sickness and health until 
he passed away from cancer. Although he 
was diagnosed with a viral illness in 1974 that 
forced him to pause his psychiatry training for 
seven years, Dr. Green bounced back with a 
demonstrated passion for scientific research. 
Dr. Green dedicated his life to researching 
schizophrenia, substance misuse disorders 
and establishing effective programs to treat 
those afflicted. As a beloved and respected 
professor and mentor, Dr. Green is often re-
membered by his students and colleagues for 
his curiosity, ambition, and drive. He was re-
lentless in his aim to improve the lives of oth-
ers and give back to those around him. His 
commitment to his work and his students will 
forever inspire the Hanover community. 
I express my wholehearted appreciation for 
Dr. Green and his devotion to medicine and 
science. As an alumna of Dartmouth College, 
I am deeply grateful for Dr. Green’s service to 
his students and the New Hampshire medical 
community. Although he will be profoundly 
missed, his memory will live on through the re-
search he conducted, the treatments he devel-
oped, the students he taught, and the commu-
nity he cared for. I offer my deepest condo-
lences to his family. I wish them and the Dart-
mouth community comfort and warmth during 
this difficult time. May he rest in peace.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE PASSING 
OF FRED SPACE 
HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of a fixture in our north-
ern New Jersey community, Fred Space. Fred 
was born in Beemerville, a community where 
he lived in, raised his family, and dedicated 
himself to improving throughout his entire life. 
As 
the 
second-generation 
owner 
and 
zookeeper of Space Farms Zoo & Museum, 
and a 77-year member of the Beemerville Fire 
Department, Fred’s commitment to his com-
munity was legendary to those who knew him. 
As part of his more than seven-decade career 
with the Beemerville Fire Department, Fred 
served as Fire Chief from 1951 to 1953. He 
was also a founding member of the Kittatinny 
Recreation Association, which would go on to 
become the Sussex County Chamber of Com-
merce. An avid outdoorsman, Fred translated 
his love of hunting, fishing, and trapping into 
the Beemerville Hunting Club, as its founding 
member. He continued his passion for the out-
doors by becoming a Lifetime Member of the 
Sussex County Board of Agriculture, serving 
as its President. He was Director of the NJ 
Farm Bureau and served on the New Jersey

Fish and Game Council from 1963 to 1971, in-
cluding a three-year stint as Chairman from 
1969 to 1971. 
Fred’s remarkable legacy will live on in the 
business he helped grow, and which bears his 
family name. For three generations now, 
Space Farms Zoo and Museum has been a 
wonderful attraction here in our community. 
Fred loved working with the animals at the 
zoo, from the famous Kodiak bear named Go-
liath, with whom he shared a particular bond; 
or the 16-foot-long, 250-pound python, with 
whom he had an infamous run-in. There was 
nothing that could dissuade Fred from his 
hands-on work at the zoo. 
Fred was a loving husband to Mira for 46 
years, and proud father of Parker, Eric, Lori, 
and Renee. Fred’s devotion to community en-
gagement and love for the outdoors will con-
tinue on through his beloved nine grand-
children and twenty-one grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Fred Space’s extraordinary 
life, his service to our community, and the leg-
acy he leaves behind.

CONCURRENT 
RESOLUTION 
ON 
THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 
2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, the Budget Res-
olution before the House is the first step to-
ward providing urgently needed relief for the 
American people, as our Nation struggles to 
address the COVID–19 pandemic and its im-
pact on our economy. 
The need for Congress to act is both great 
and urgent. We’re in a race against death, 
with over 450,000 fellow Americans lost to 
COVID–19. Our failure to defeat the virus has 
dragged our economy down, with more than 
18 million Americans currently unemployed 
and scheduled to lose their unemployment in-
surance in six weeks if Congress does not act. 
House Concurrent Resolution 11 allows 
Congress to quickly pass a bold $1.9 trillion 
relief bill to defeat the virus, support workers 
and small businesses, and help families until 
the economy can reopen. President Biden’s 
American Rescue Plan includes $20 billion for 
a national vaccination strategy to increase 
supply and vaccination sites; $50 billion to 
scale up testing through the purchasing of 
rapid tests and expanded lab capacity; and $3 
billion in innovative COVID–19 treatments. 
While we have effective vaccines to prevent 
people from getting COVID–19, we do not yet 
have accessible medicines to treat people who 
are sick with the disease. This plan funds re-
search and large-scale clinical trials needed to 
develop therapeutics such as antivirals and 
antibodies 
to 
help 
people recover from 
COVID–19. The American Rescue Plan will 
also extend increased unemployment insur-
ance for laid-off workers and provide re-
sources for state and local governments to 
preserve the jobs of essential public workers 
fighting on the frontlines against this pan-
demic. These are the right policies at the right 
time. 
House Concurrent Resolution 11, the Budg-
et Resolution for Fiscal Year 2021, allows 
Congress to provide pandemic relief through 
reconciliation, a procedure that allows the 
Senate to bypass the filibuster and pass this 
legislation with a simple majority vote. The 
American people simply want Congress to 
help them survive this pandemic and defeat 
the virus. This resolution is a major step in 
making good on our promise to provide bold, 
urgent, and necessary support to those who 
have been hit the hardest by the pandemic 
and to address our cascading economy, and I 
urge my colleagues to support it.

HONORING MR. SAM SPRUELL OF 
MOUNT HOPE, ALABAMA 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to recognize Mr. Sam Spruell from Mount 
Hope, Alabama, who passed away on January 
7, 2021 after a life of 63 years. He was an up-
standing citizen of our State, a respected 
member of the Mount Hope community, and 
an outstanding businessman and farmer. 
Sam Spruell was an Alabamian through and 
through, widely known for the kindness and 
friendship he displayed throughout his entire 
life. More importantly, Sam was a husband, fa-
ther, and farmer who cared deeply about his 
work and the people around him. Never miss-
ing an opportunity to lend a helping hand, 
Sam was always available to those who need-
ed him. 
Sam was also a champion for Alabama cot-
ton and the producers throughout the State. 
He served as President of the Southern Cot-
ton Growers from 2004 to 2005, a testament 
to his dedication and passion to the industry. 
He was also a member of the Southeastern 
Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation, the Ala-
bama Cotton Commission, and the National 
Cotton Council. There is no doubt that Sam’s 
countless hours of hard work in these arenas 
made an indelible impact for the State of Ala-
bama and the nation—one that will continue 
for years to come. 
Sam Spruell was a sincere and true man of 
God. As a leader of the Community Clothes 
Closet and Ministry of Hope, Sam played a 
key role in serving those around him. He went 
on to donate an entire building to The Caring 
Place, a charity near and dear to his heart. 
Sam Spruell is now survived by his wife, 
Lynn Spruell; and two children, Jonathon 
Spruell and Liz Rhodes. In addition, he is sur-
vived by his five grandchildren, Shelby, Madi, 
Max, Mia, and Cam. 
Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of 
Sam’s family and friends. The Fourth District, 
the State of Alabama, and the Nation have 
lost a friend and patriot. However, there is no 
question that his legacy and impact will live on 
well into the future.

REMEMBERING AND HONORING 
ELEANOR ‘‘SANDY’’ TORREY WEST 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today with a heavy heart to remember 
and honor Mrs. Eleanor, or ‘‘Sandy,’’ Torrey 
West, who passed away on January 17th at 
the age of one hundred and eight. 
Mrs. West was known as a woman who em-
bodied the spirit of Ossabaw Island, which is 
the third-largest of Georgia’s barrier islands, 
just south of Savannah. 
She established the Ossabaw Island Project 
in the 1960s and the Genesis Project in the 
1970s as ways to allow students, artists, writ-
ers, scientists, ecologists, philosophers, and 
other intellectuals and creative thinkers to re-
connect with the natural world, and with each 
other. 
In the late 1970s, Mrs. West spearheaded 
her family’s effort to assure that Ossabaw Is-
land would remain preserved and protected. 
She was the champion of Ossabaw, and her 
enthusiastic, joyful spirit shined in everything 
she did. Throughout Mrs. West’s long, pros-
perous life, she inspired countless individuals. 
I am so thankful for her many contributions to 
Georgia’s First District, and I know her legacy 
will continue for years to come. 
My thoughts and prayers are with her fam-
ily, friends, and all who knew her during this 
most difficult time.

HONORING HANNAH YOTHERS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Hannah Yothers on 
becoming one of the first young women in the 
Westmoreland-Fayette Council Boy Scouts of 
American to achieve the position of Eagle 
Scout. 
Hannah joined the Boy Scouts in 2019, 
when girls were first able to join. She was one 
of the founding members of Troop 1372, 
which is partnered with the all-male Troop 
372. Hannah first began her goal of becoming 
an Eagle Scout while in her senior year at 
Greater Latrobe High School and finished 
while attending Penn State Behrend in Erie. 
In her journey to become an Eagle Scout, 
Hannah earned 31 merit badges, 10 more 
than the 21 required. For her Eagle Scout 
project, Hannah worked on landscaping, built 
two benches that can be converted into picnic 
tables, and other tasks at the Westmoreland 
Cleanways Recycling Center in Unity. 
Hannah already is giving back to the Boy 
Scouts of America and her community by 
serving as an assistant Scoutmaster. On be-
half of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional Dis-
trict, I congratulate Hannah Yothers on her 
trailblazing achievement and wish her all the 
best in the chapters to come.

February 11, 2021 
construction of new permanent fencing on the 
grounds of the United States Capitol complex. 
Since the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol 
on January 6, 2021, the Capitol complex has 
become an untraversable fortress surrounded 
by frightening fences capped with barbed wire, 
typical of authoritarian regimes. In recent 
days, some officials, including the Acting Cap-
itol Police Chief, have suggested that fencing 
become a permanent security feature of the 
Capitol complex. Although I agree that more 
needs to be done to protect the Capitol com-
plex, the failure of Capitol security leaders to 
plan for the predictable and openly announced 
attack on the Capitol does not justify closing 
the complex from the public, to whom it be-
longs. We can and must maintain our commit-
ment to security without sacrificing public ac-
cess by using the least restrictive means nec-
essary to address security. 
The attack on the Capitol, which had little to 
do with the lack of permanent fencing, was the 
greatest intelligence and security failure in the 
history of our Nation’s capital. There were 
countless security failures on January 6 that 
we can and must address, including: Taking 
threats of extremist violence seriously at an 
earlier stage; blocking off the Capitol during 
high-profile and high-threat events, as is typi-
cally done, but was not done on January 6; 
manpower; and training. Permanent fencing, 
which is incredibly imprecise, would not ad-
dress these very real security lapses. It is 
more likely to keep out children, joggers and 
tourists than a coordinated attack on the Cap-
itol. In fact, it is another form of security the-
ater—it would make the Capitol ‘‘look’’ safe 
but mask the lack of state-of-the-art security 
measures that could actually prevent attacks 
in the future. Just in the past few days, secu-
rity experts have already begun putting for-
ward innovative ways to protect the Capitol 
while also protecting the values of openness 
and transparency, which are central to our de-
mocracy. We must foster that dialogue and 
welcome fresh ideas, not default to an archaic 
security strategy that humans invented over 
10,000 years ago. 
Permanent fencing would send an un-Amer-
ican message to the Nation and the world, by 
transforming our democracy from one that is 
accessible and of the people to one that is ex-
clusive and fearful of its own citizens. It would 
tell the world that the most powerful nation 
must rely on crude barriers for safety instead 
of state-of-the-art intelligence and security pro-
tocols. The Capitol has welcomed First 
Amendment protests and demonstrations for 
centuries without becoming a fortress. The 
openness of the Capitol and our democracy is 
our strength, not a security weakness that 
needs to be rooted out. Any further consider-
ation of permanent fencing is desperate, dis-
tasteful and disrespectful of our history and in-
stitutions. 
Furthermore, we cannot forget that the Cap-
itol complex does not exist in a vacuum. It is 
immediately surrounded by residential neigh-
borhoods and local businesses, which form 
the heart of the District of Columbia. Perma-
nent fencing would cause serious damage to 
the fabric of these communities. These resi-
dents and businesses have been more than 
understanding as their neighborhoods have 
turned into militarized zones. They have wait-
ed patiently as officers check their identifica-
tion on their walk home and taken alternative 
routes when they have found blocked streets. 
Permanent fencing would infringe on their abil-
ity, as well as the general public’s ability, to 
enjoy the public spaces that define our na-
tion’s capital. 
Already, the distance between government 
and the people has grown, with trust in gov-
ernment at historic lows. We should not en-
trench that distance further by placing intimi-
dating barriers between ourselves as public 
servants and the people we serve, especially 
when such barriers are neither effective nor 
necessary. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ROBUST 
INTERNATIONAL 
RESPONSE 
TO 
PANDEMIC ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce the Robust Inter-
national Response to Pandemic Act, along 
with my colleagues JAN SCHAKOWSKY of Illinois 
and MARK TAKANO of California. 
The COVID–19 pandemic and the economic 
crisis it has generated are global problems 
and both require global solutions. The United 
States must show leadership by supporting 
each country’s ability to fight the virus, and the 
Robust International Response to Pandemic 
Act will do that by supporting an issuance of 
Special Drawing Rights from the IMF that will 
boost the global economy and aid our re-
sponse to the virus. 
‘‘Special Drawing Rights’’ will help countries 
avoid depleting their reserves during the turbu-
lent economic times ahead; 2 trillion SDRs will 
help all of us—and especially emerging mar-
kets and developing economies—avoid finan-
cial catastrophe. 
I urge this body to advance this important 
legislation.

RECOGNIZING JOHN BONANNI AND 
ANTHONY J. DENOVA FOR RE-
CEIVING THE FIRST-EVER COUN-

ADMINISTRATOR 
LIFETIME 
ACHIEVEMENT AWARD 
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to recognize Morris County Administrator 
John Bonanni and Passaic County Adminis-
trator Anthony J. DeNova for receiving the 
first-ever 
County 
Administrator 
Lifetime 
Achievement Award from the New Jersey As-
sociation of Counties (NJAC). This award was 
created to highlight and honor the lifetime of 
dedication and hard work public officials like 
Bonanni and DeNova have brought to our 
communities in North Jersey. 
John Bonanni is known for his deep commit-
ment to Morris County, as a lifelong resident 
from Boonton and over 30 years of service in 
county administration. John does not like to be 
in the spotlight, but this award reflects how we 
all depend on his quiet, behind the scenes 
leadership. Early on in the coronavirus pan-
demic, he acted fast to protect those at high 
risk: long-term care residents, seniors, and 
people with disabilities. He was instrumental in 
securing funding for Morris County and other 
counties from the state’s allocation of the Co-
rona virus Relief Fund to cover critical expend-
itures on testing, PPE procurement, and crisis 
pay for first responders. 
Anthony J. DeNova has deep roots in Pas-
saic County and his dedication to and love for 
the community he has lived in his whole life 
shines through in the work he does each day. 
You would be hard-pressed to find anyone 
who does not consider Tony their friend. 
Under his leadership, strong county budgeting 
has barred any tax increases for his constitu-
ents, while still funding the county’s most im-
portant programs. When the pandemic hit, he 
worked swiftly to set up testing sites and at- 
home testing for all Passaic residents. With 
the COVID–19 vaccine distribution underway, 
he has worked diligently to get vaccination 
sites up and running and get shots into arms. 
County Administrators play a vital role in our 
counties and communities. John Bonanni and 
Anthony DeNova dedicated themselves to 
public service and improving the everyday 
lives of the residents of Morris and Passaic 
counties. Their leadership was critical in guid-
ing NJ–11 through the darkest day of the pan-
demic. It has been a pleasure working with 
both of them over the past two years and I 
look forward to the years ahead. This lifetime 
achievement award is well-deserved.

CONGRATULATING BRITNEE 
KINARD 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 11, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate SD Gunner Fund’s 
Britnee Kinard for receiving the President’s 
Lifetime Achievement Award because of her 
outstanding service to fellow Americans. The 
AmeriCorp’s President’s Lifetime Achievement 
Award is the highest honor of the President’s 
Volunteer Service Award, and it recognizes in-
dividuals, families, and groups who achieve a 
remarkable number of service hours. 
In 
receiving 
the 
Lifetime 
Achievement 
Award, Britnee is being recognized for her 
over 4,000 hours of service to ensure the con-
tinuation of America’s unrivaled commitment to 
improving countless lives. Britnee is the found-
er and President of SD Gunner Fund, which is 
an incredible organization that assists vet-
erans, exceptional children, and first respond-
ers in receiving vital resources such as service 
dogs, therapy dogs, emergency assistance, 
community advocacy and education, and 
much more. 
She was inspired to start the successful SD 
Gunner Fund when she left her high profile 
career in business to become a full-time care-
giver to her husband after he suffered life-al-
tering injuries while serving our country in Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom. 
I want to thank Britnee for her selfless com-
mitment to service through SD Gunner Fund, 
and I wish her the best. I’m extremely proud 
to have Britnee here in the First Congressional 
District of Georgia.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the Waynesboro 
Area School District students, teachers, and 
leaders as they celebrate the successful com-
pletion of 100 days of school during the 2020– 
2021 academic year—a great accomplishment 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This ongoing public health crisis has af-
fected every American community across the 
country—including our children and schools. 
Despite the challenges they are facing, the 
Waynesboro Area School District is open for 
in-person instruction and has only required vir-
tual instruction for eight days this school year. 
Getting children safely back to school is a 
key piece of our nation’s recovery from this 
pandemic, and I applaud the Waynesboro 
Area School District leaders, teachers, staff, 
and parents for their commitment to their stu-
dents’ continuity of quality education. 
As they mark their 100th day of school, I 
congratulate the Waynesboro Area School 
District community on a successful reopening 
of in-person instruction and wish them a con-
tinued safe and successful school year.
