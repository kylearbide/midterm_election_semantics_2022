PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, Lord of history, if a 
sparrow does not fall without Your 
knowledge, certainly the issues facing 
our Senate concern You. 
Your Word assures us that in every-
thing, You are working for the good of 
those who love You. May that promise 
guide our lawmakers as they seek equi-
table and just solutions to complicated 
problems. 
Lord, give our Senators the wisdom 
to discern, courage to believe, and the 
determination to do Your will. 
Bless, O God, the faithful men and 
women who manage the machinery of 
the Senate, without whom this legisla-
tive body could not function. Thank 
You for their efficient and productive 
work. 
Lord, fill this Chamber with Your 
presence. 
We ask in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
TRIBUTE TO BEN RAY LUJA´ N 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now, at the beginning, before I speak 
on the business of the day, I would like 
to add that yesterday we were all over-
joyed, just thrilled, to hear from our 
colleague, our dear friend, Senator BEN 
RAY LUJA´ N. 
Through his first public video mes-
sage shared on social media, BEN RAY 
reiterated yesterday that his recovery 
is going well; that his office continues 
to work serving the people of New Mex-
ico; and that he expects, praise God, to 
make a full recovery. 
I have been able to get on the phone 
with him in recent days. He was chip-
per. He sounded like the same BEN RAY 
we have come to know and love, and I 
can report he is in very good spirits, 
raring to go. 
From now until his return, all of us 
in the Senate miss him greatly. We are 
rooting for him. We cannot wait to see 
him walk through the doors of this 
Chamber once again to get back to 
work. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, now on Senate 
business, on Postal, last week, as you 
know, the House passed, with over-
whelming bipartisan support—I believe 
a majority from each party—the most 
important update to the U.S. Postal 
Service in decades. 
The Postal bill is the definition of 
legislation that should sail through the 
Congress. Both sides support it. It had 
diligent work by both Democrats and 
Republicans, with major input from

February 14, 2022 
both parties. Everyone knows we need 
it, and the American people so strongly 
support action to put our Postal Serv-
ice on sustainable footing. 
Our incredible postal workers give us 
their very best every single day they 
are on the job. They deserve no less in 
return. 
So many people depend on the mail. 
You could be a veteran; the VA sends 
your prescriptions through the mail. 
About one-fifth of Social Security re-
cipients, as I understand, don’t have 
the internet and depend on the mail. 
Small businesses depend on the mail. 
Rural areas depend on the mail. Just 
about everybody does. People don’t 
want snail mail. 
It has been no fault of the workers at 
the post office that postal delivery is 
slow. They don’t have the resources 
they need, and, in part, they don’t have 
the resources they need because they 
have a crazy, antediluvian-type system 
of how they calculate pensions and 
healthcare. 
We have to change all this. We have 
been waiting a long, long time. Later 
today, I am going to move to have the 
Senate approve a few technical fixes to 
the bill so we can move closer to final 
passage. The House made these fixes on 
their end through unanimous consent 
last week. Not a Democrat nor Repub-
lican in that whole body blocked it, 
and anyone could have. We want to do 
the same here in the Senate. 
I hope my Republican colleagues will 
give consent to allow these necessary 
fixes to go through, just as it happened 
in the House. As I said, Members from 
both sides worked very, very hard to 
put this bill together. It commands 
strong, bipartisan support, and we 
should move forward with it as soon as 
we can. Bipartisan postal reform al-
ready has enough support to become 
law. I hope it happens quickly. 
Let me just say this once again so 
people understand what is going on 
here. All we are asking for is to fix a 
small clerical error made by the House 
of Representatives when they sent 
their bill to the Senate. It has nothing 
to do with the substance of the bill. As 
I mentioned, this fix—this small, little, 
immaterial change that is technical— 
received 
unanimous 
consent, 
every 
Democrat and every Republican, in the 
House. So let’s have the same outcome 
here in the Senate tonight. Let’s move 
forward on this proposal. 
At the end of the day, it is about 
making sure the post office can fulfill 
its obligations to its workers and to 
the American people. We all know how 
many of us—millions of us—depend on 
the mail. We all know how we have 
been disappointed that mail service has 
slowed down. We all know that we 
should get together, Democrats and 
Republicans, to fix it. 
The bipartisan reform bill will make 
sure Americans can continue relying 
on the post office the same way they 
have relied on it all their lives. 
I hope that here in the Senate, we 
will keep working on this bill with the 
same bipartisan spirit we have seen for 
the past week. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Madam President, our other priority 
this week will be approving legislation 
to keep the government open until 
March 11 so we can give appropriators 
from both parties more time to draft 
the yearlong omnibus funding bill. 
This is another place where we are 
making bipartisan progress. Led by 
Senators LEAHY and SHELBY and their 
counterparts in the House, Representa-
tives DELAURO and GRANGER, we have 
come to good agreements on top-line 
numbers, and we can move forward— 
not with a CR, which simply just re-
enacts what was in place last year de-
spite the need for changes, in many 
ways—but we can enact what we call 
an omnibus, which is what we should 
be doing. 
We have had positive conversations, 
and Democrats are united to keep the 
government open so we can achieve 
this omnibus. We will continue work-
ing with the Republican leadership to 
move forward on a CR before the dead-
line later this week. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION 
Madam President, on SCOTUS, the 
Supreme Court of the United States, 
well, one of the most solemn respon-
sibilities entrusted to the U.S. Senate 
is offering our advice and ultimately 
our consent on the President’s appoint-
ments to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is 
a responsibility that stands apart from 
just about all others. Those whom we 
approve sit on the Court, and they will 
render judgment and exert influence on 
the most consequential legal matters 
for years and potentially for decades. 
The impact of any one Supreme Court 
nominee is often felt long after the 
work of a single administration comes 
to an end. 
Very soon, this will be precisely the 
task the Senate will be asked to take 
up once again when President Biden 
announces his choice to replace Asso-
ciate Justice Breyer. I have no doubt 
President Biden will name someone 
who can not only bring Members of 
this body together but someone with a 
proven 
record 
for 
excellence 
and 
evenhandedness. When President Biden 
makes his announcement, I intend to 
have the Senate move quickly to take 
up and confirm his nominee. 
The President has promised he will 
nominate a Black woman to serve as a 
Justice for the first time ever. This 
will not only be one of the most impor-
tant moments in the history of our 
courts but of our entire country. Pre-
cious few have held the title of ‘‘Jus-
tice’’ in American history—only 115 to 
date—and none of them has been a 
Black woman. So the President’s an-
nouncement is truly historic and po-
tentially game-changing for the future 
of Supreme Court nominees. 
Imagine the impact the President’s 
pick will have on countless young peo-
ple who look up to the Nation’s courts 
and see men and women who better re-
flect our country’s makeup. Imagine 
how that will inspire the next genera-
tion to pursue their own interests in 
public service and law and government. 
The judges and Justices of the future 
have their eyes on this body right now 
in the present. 
If our democracy is to prosper in this 
century, we need people from all walks 
of life to see that they have a place at 
the table when it comes to public serv-
ice. The President’s promise is a big 
step in that direction. 
The Democratic-led Senate has al-
ready played an important role in 
bringing balance and diversity to our 
courts with highly qualified nominees. 
It has been one of our highest priorities 
from the moment we entered the ma-
jority. 
Under President Biden, the Senate 
has confirmed 46 judges to serve life-
time appointments to the Federal 
Bench. Indeed, this majority has con-
firmed the most judges in the first year 
following the President’s inauguration 
since the time of John F. Kennedy. 
Three-quarters of these new judges 
have 
been 
women—three-quarters. 
Two-thirds have been people of color. 
More than a quarter of all of President 
Biden’s appointees have been Black 
women, who are still too far underrep-
resented in our Federal Judiciary. 
It is not just their demographic di-
versity that makes them remarkable, 
although that is unquestionably impor-
tant; the new judges are also diverse 
because of their professional back-
grounds. We have confirmed more Fed-
eral defenders in the President’s first 
year than any President in modern his-
tory. We have confirmed more civil 
rights lawyers, election lawyers, more 
individuals with deep experience in 
public service. 
I want to emphasize one other thing. 
These nominees are also extremely 
qualified. We are not sacrificing quali-
fications and excellence for diversity. 
President Biden’s nominees are both 
more diverse and more qualified, in my 
judgment, than any President’s in re-
cent history. 
So Senate Democrats are proud of 
this record, and we are going to keep 
going. Diversity in all of its forms mat-
ters. It is good for the justice system, 
and it is vital to the health of our de-
mocracy. 
When the President announces his 
historic pick, the Senate will be ready 
to move quickly and fairly to confirm 
her to the Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

The legislative clerk proceeded to

S655 
February 14, 2022 
state of the pandemic 2 years in, about 
letting American families get back to 
normal. The current science clearly 
supports the 70 percent of Americans 
who believe we must accept this virus 
is here to stay, trust the science, and 
proceed with normal life. 
At the time, this was not a universal 
sentiment. The next day, across the 
river, liberals tried to shame Virginia’s 
new Governor for forgoing a mask in 
an incredibly vaccinated area where 
cases had been falling for weeks. 
The top Democrat in the Virginia 
State Senate criticized the Governor 
and backed ongoing school mask man-
dates as ‘‘common sense.’’ But, my 
goodness, 
how 
quickly 
things 
can 
change. 
A few days ago, I understand the 
same State senate leader did a 180-de-
gree turn and voted for an amendment 
to end school mask mandates. A dam 
had begun to break nationwide. A week 
ago, leaders in Democrat-run New Jer-
sey, Connecticut, Delaware, and Or-
egon announced they would ax or relax 
their mask and/or vaccine mandates in 
the near future. By the end of the 
week, States, including California, Illi-
nois, Nevada, New York, and Rhode Is-
land had followed suit to varying de-
grees. 
Now, obviously, the scientific facts 
have not changed in the last few weeks. 
We have known for many weeks that 
this variant is significantly milder, and 
we have known for many months that 
the universally available vaccines re-
duce the odds of hospitalization or 
death down to the level of many rou-
tine risks that we all face constantly 
in our daily lives. The only science 
that has changed in the last 2 weeks is 
the political science. The only data 
that has changed in the last 2 weeks is 
the Democrats’ polling data. 
The Washington Post put it like this: 
The ‘‘abrupt end to mask mandates re-
flects a shifting political landscape.’’ 
Ah, but there is a problem. 
While Democratic leaders are stam-
peding to finally follow the science and 
end burdensome mandates on adults in 
many places, America’s children are 
still being left behind. States like New 
York and California are rolling back 
restrictions on adults but have yet to 
provide any end date or off-ramp for 
mask mandates in K–12 schools. This is 
completely backward since we have 
known for well over a year that COVID 
poses far lower risks to children than 
to adults. 
Officials in Illinois and the District 
of Columbia have embraced the same 
double standard, winding back general 
public mandates while leaving the 
schools with no end date in sight. In 
other words, here in Washington, the 
Mayor’s office will be lifting mandates 
next week in all kinds of adult estab-
lishments, from bars to fitness studios, 
while 
keeping 
kids 
in 
classrooms, 
masked up for at least—at least—an-
other month. 
Even as Democrats permit grownups 
to get back to normal, they are 
clinging onto their emergency powers 
over K–12 classrooms. The ultrarich, 
ultrapowerful 
teachers 
unions 
that 
have been antagonists of normal child-
hoods at each step of the pandemic are 
continuing to drag their heels. 
For 2 years now, Democrats at the 
local, State, and Federal levels have 
let a labor executive named Randi 
Weingarten become something of an 
unelected 
national 
classroom 
czar, 
holding millions of kids’ fates in her 
hand. Science has proven over and over 
again that in-person schooling is safe 
for kids, but Big Labor has sought to 
move the goalposts every time, and 
Democrats have mostly gone along 
with it. 
Last year, Ms. Weingarten bragged 
publicly that the Biden administration 
had invited her own hyperpolitical 
teachers union to basically author the 
scientific guidelines for school re-
openings. The Biden administration 
took the pen away from doctors and ex-
perts and handed it to Big Labor. She 
boasted: 
They asked us for language and we gave 
them language. 
Reporters found multiple instances 
where the union’s words were copied 
and pasted directly—directly—into the 
final CDC document. 
Now the same Ms. Weingarten is try-
ing to move the goalposts again on 
America’s kids to an even more ex-
treme and unscientific place. She as-
serted last week that little kids should 
have to keep covering their faces in 
schools until there is ‘‘no dissemina-
tion and transmission in schools.’’ 
With respect, that is completely bon-
kers, absolutely bonkers. There is no 
credible scientist or doctor in America 
who believes that we are headed toward 
zero COVID. We are not going to magi-
cally eradicate this virus; it is heading 
endemic. So Ms. Weingarten’s latest 
made-up standard would have K–12 kids 
covering their faces literally forever. 
Little kids in masks forever? That is 
the upshot of this top Biden adminis-
tration’s ally’s public demands. This is 
utter madness. 
Two years ago, the American people 
accepted 
temporary 
disruptions 
to 
their daily lives in order to prevent our 
hospitals from collapsing and to buy 
scientists time to invent vaccines and 
therapeutics. Check, check, and check. 
Our healthcare system endured. We 
have remarkable, safe, and effective 
vaccines; we have therapeutics; and we 
know that, thank God, none of these 
variants have posed a medical emer-
gency for the vast majority of chil-
dren—period. 
Americans who watched the Super 
Bowl saw rich celebrities having a 
grand time with hardly a mask in 
sight, but under the Democrats’ poli-
cies, first graders who watched that 
big, maskless party last night had to 
wake up this morning and cover their 
own faces in order to go to school. 
America’s classrooms seem to be the 
last places where local, State, and Fed-
eral Democrats will accept that cost- 
benefit calculations exist, and zero 
transmission is simply not possible. 
For 2 years now, the Democratic 
Party has allowed some of the most 
powerful special interests in our coun-
try to profoundly—profoundly—disrupt 
children’s lives. The political left has 
put kids last. That is simply not ac-
ceptable. American families deserve 
normalcy; they deserve it right now; 
and this side of the aisle, the party of 
parents, has their back. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, it is no secret that Vladimir 
Putin longs to restore and rebuild part 
of the old Soviet Union. Putin wants 
Russia to be a superpower, and he 
knows what he is lacking. 
Russia is a one-trick pony with a lot 
of energy. It offers little except that. 
Its population is a tenth of the size of 
China’s. Putin knows he needs to 
strengthen his military, economy, and 
position in the world, and he has been 
ruthless in that pursuit. 
We should not, then, be surprised 
that he is escalating his actions. It is a 
quest he has been on for many, many 
years. In 2008, Russia invaded the coun-
try of Georgia; in 2014, Russia invaded 
Ukraine to take the region of Crimea; 
and last year, Russia began to gather 
troops along the Ukrainian border. 
Putin rejects Western ideals; he toys 
with sovereign nations; and he plays by 
an entirely different set of rules—his 
own. And when President Biden signals 
that our words are hollow or that we 
will disregard our allies, our adver-
saries, like Putin, take notice. 
In September of last year, the world 
watched as our military was ordered to 
retreat from Afghanistan; we aban-
doned our allies; and we left civilians 
at the mercy of the Taliban. In Octo-
ber, Russia further built up its inva-
sion force along the Ukrainian border. 
Last month, North Korea, once again, 
tested missiles. Iran is, perhaps, a few 
weeks away from building its own nu-
clear bomb; and today, as I speak, 
China struts at the Olympics while it 
tortures its citizens. 
The Chinese Communist Party seeks 
to dominate its neighbors and devour 
our ally, Taiwan. Communist China’s 
navy has more ships than the U.S. 
Navy’s, and their weapons grow more 
sophisticated than ours every day. 
Here is just an example: The Chinese 
successfully tested a hypersonic mis-
sile in December while we are still at 
the drawing board. 
Dictators and bullies zero in on 
weakness like a homing beacon. In the 
absence of our inaction, our adver-
saries will move with a level of deci-
siveness President Biden could only 
dream of.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S656 
February 14, 2022 
Putin does not want a war with the 
United States and our allies in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or 
NATO. This would be foolish. Putin’s 
goal is to deter Ukraine from joining 
NATO. He wants their pro-democracy 
government to collapse, for Ukrainians 
to abandon their resolve, and wants to 
take over the country that largely de-
spises him. He wants a buffer between 
him and the West, and he wants the 
United States to step aside and let him 
do this. 
To be clear, we do not—we do not— 
want American bloodshed in Ukraine, 
but neither do the Ukrainians. 
Last year, I traveled to Ukraine with 
several other Members of Congress and 
met 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy 
of 
Ukraine. The Ukrainian President told 
me, ‘‘Ukrainians do not want Ameri-
cans’ boots on the ground.’’ Ukrainians 
are willing and ready to fight their own 
fight. All they ask is for support; not 
blankets and helmets, but weapons— 
weapons that can help them fight off 
the aggression. 
While Ukrainians have been sounding 
an alarm, our President has been 
asleep at the wheel. When Russia was 
amassing troops along the Ukrainian 
border, President Biden was giving a 
blistering speech about voting rights, 
saying anyone who disagrees with him 
wants to destroy our country. Instead 
of studying war plans on Afghanistan 
or addressing the growing threats from 
Russia and China, our servicemembers 
were forced to spend hours upon hours 
on ‘‘woke’’ training, not on readiness 
and becoming a first-class soldier. 
But the missed opportunities don’t 
stop at this administration. The Sen-
ate already missed a chance to hit 
Putin where it hurts. 
A few weeks ago, Senate Republicans 
voted in support of sanctions on Rus-
sia’s pipeline through Europe, the Nord 
Stream 2. Senate Democrats refused to 
support these sanctions. Who are they 
more afraid of, President Biden or 
Putin? 
President Biden has spent a year de-
ploying a diplomacy-first strategy—the 
same page out of the same playbook 
from when he was our Vice President. 
The definition of insanity is doing the 
same thing over and over, expecting 
different results. 
Flawed decisions leads to failed out-
comes. And weak leadership leads to 
bullies pushing the boundaries, like 
Vladimir Putin. It is time for President 
Biden to step up. Aggression must be 
met with resolve. 
We need to bring the full might of 
sanctions and squeeze Russia’s econ-
omy so tight it chokes Putin’s wealth. 
This 
includes 
sanctions 
on 
Nord 
Stream 2 and actions like delisting 
Russian companies in our capital mar-
kets, hopefully, to devalue their cur-
rency, the ruble. 
We need to show Putin that it is 
shortsighted to take Ukraine and think 
it is a victory. This may be another ef-
fort in a decades-long pursuit, but it 
will be met with fury and a fury of 
sanctions. 
Looking forward, the question be-
comes this: When our adversaries like 
Russia and China test our resolve 
again, will they be met with meekness 
or might? Standing on this floor, lob-
bing advice to our President to be 
stronger, to get tough, is not enough 
and is not going to work. That is too 
simplistic of a view. This moment re-
quires more than that. 
The answer is not to simply project 
strength; it is to be strong. We have to 
be a strong nation that impresses and 
scares the bullies—not a weak country 
but a country that is strong. We need 
to get back to what makes this coun-
try so great in the first place, and that 
is the following: 
First, 
practice 
peace 
through 
strength. That means we make the nec-
essary investments to modernize our 
military. The highest possible percent-
age of money we spend at the Depart-
ment of Defense should go to building a 
killing machine. We are a superpower; 
we are not trying to be one. But our ad-
versaries are outpacing us. 
Second, 
return 
our 
economic 
strength. We have to get our physical 
house in order, and it starts in Con-
gress. Inflation has engulfed our econ-
omy. 
Families 
face 
bare 
grocery 
shelves and gas that is more, in some 
places, than $5 a gallon. Our national 
debt 
just 
crested 
at 
$30 
trillion, 
amounting to almost $100,000 per cit-
izen in our country alone, just their 
debt themselves. We need to return to 
a free market enterprise with less gov-
ernment intervention. 
And, 
third, 
regain 
our 
political 
strength by anchoring in our American 
strength of character. That is what 
this country is about. 
In the past year, the administration 
has shown our borders and our laws are 
not important. Over 2 million immi-
grants entered our country illegally 
day by day, and that figure increases 
as we speak. 
Additionally, COVID’s winter surge 
caught the administration flat-footed, 
leaving the most vulnerable among us 
short of tests and of therapeutics. 
Our country is divided on issues 
ranging 
from 
education 
to 
public 
health. The administration has at-
tacked the policies and beliefs that 
made our country so great. But we 
have to return to champion that spirit 
of American resolve and determination 
in all facets of life. The strength of our 
Nation depends on it. The future of our 
Nation depends on it. 
After this dark year marked by un-
certainty, Americans are ready to re-
turn to the path of American independ-
ence. Americans across the country 
want to reignite the American dream 
and rekindle American ingenuity. We 
should all—this is something all of us— 
from Members of Congress to our Presi-
dent—should want. 
Putin thinks that because our Presi-
dent has projected weakness, America 
is weak. How wrong he is. 
To Russia and China, I say, betting 
against the United States and rolling 
the dice against Ukraine or Taiwan is a 
losing game. 
We need to show the world that the 
United States is still the brightest bea-
con of freedom, hope, and democracy. 
Again, I do not want American blood to 
be shed in Ukraine, but we should sup-
port a democracy against any tyrant. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF PARKLAND SCHOOL 
SHOOTING 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
am here today to take a moment and 
remember the tragedy that occurred 4 
years ago at Marjory Stoneman Doug-
las High School in Parkland, FL. And I 
want to discuss some legislation that I 
have introduced that results from that. 
But remember that day. 
On that day, we lost 17 innocent souls 
from this globe of ours, and it was at 
the hands of a troubled and evil young 
man who entered the school and opened 
fire. 
This tragedy can’t be forgotten and 
should not be forgotten, not by the sur-
vivors of this attack, not by the fami-
lies who lost loved ones, and then, 
eventually, not by this Congress be-
cause we can do something about it. 
We must continue finding solutions to 
prevent these attacks. In this spirit, 
today, I am back here on the Senate 
floor pushing for passage of my bipar-
tisan and bicameral EAGLES Act. 
My bill is supported by over 40 State 
attorneys general, along with several 
groups, including Stand with Parkland, 
the Fraternal Order of Police, the Na-
tional Association of Secondary School 
Principals, and, lastly, the Major Coun-
ty Sheriffs of America. 
Passing the EAGLES Act is very 
vital in our fight to protect our schools 
and to promote a safe and healthy 
learning environment for our children. 
Just this month, the National Insti-
tute of Justice published an article dis-
cussing common traits of people who 
engage in mass shootings. This study 
covers the years between 1966 and 2019. 
Their analysis showed that the peo-
ple who commit these acts were com-
monly troubled by personal trauma be-
fore the shooting, nearly always in a 
state of crisis at the time they com-
mitted their awful acts, and in most 
cases even engaged in leaking their 
plans before they opened fire. Every 
single one of those findings applies to 
the shooter at Parkland, FL. 
It is clear that we need to ramp up 
prevention efforts. We need the EA-
GLES Act because that act would 
achieve these aims, and it would do it 
by reauthorizing and expanding the 
U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat 
Assessment Center to proactively iden-
tify and manage threats before they re-
sult in more tragedies. The National

Threat Assessment Center studies tar-
geted violence and proactively identi-
fies how to manage threats before they 
result in more tragedies. 
The bill that I introduced, the EA-
GLES Act, also establishes a Safe 
Schools Initiative to look at school vi-
olence prevention and expands research 
on school violence. 
My bill also provides funding to hire 
social scientists with expertise in child 
psychological development to support 
the National Threat Assessment Cen-
ter’s work. This is important to make 
sure that proven and evidence-based 
policies will continue to support every-
one in the school environment and do 
it positively. 
Students need more support from 
Congress for a safe, positive, and inclu-
sive learning environment. The EA-
GLES Act delivers just that by pro-
viding resources and training to school 
personnel, which will enable them to 
identify troubled youth and give them 
the intervention and treatment they 
need, hopefully long before an inter-
vention is needed by law enforcement. 
While we cannot undo the tragedies 
of the past, we must continue working 
on ways to prevent future tragedies. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The Senator from West 
Virginia. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT MCKINNON CALIFF 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to once again express my ex-
treme disbelief and disappointment 
that the U.S. Senate will vote to con-
firm Dr. Robert M. Califf to yet again 
lead the Food and Drug Administra-
tion. My opposition is nothing new. In 
fact, it was exactly 5 years ago next 
week that I came to the Senate floor to 
urge my colleagues to oppose Dr. 
Califf’s nomination to serve under 
then-President Obama in this same 
role. 
In the 5 years since Dr. Califf was 
confirmed, more than 400,000 Ameri-
cans and 5,000 West Virginians have 
died from a drug-related overdose. And 
2020 was the deadliest year on record 
for drug-related overdoses, when 1,386 
West 
Virginians 
and 
nearly 
95,000 
Americans died from a drug-related 
overdose. That number is just increas-
ing, with over 100,000 Americans having 
died from overdoses between April 2020 
and April 2021. Let’s not beat around 
the bush: Dr. Califf bears a great deal 
of responsibility for these deaths. 
We have a luxury with this nomina-
tion that we are not usually granted. 
Because Dr. Califf has already served 
as the FDA Commissioner, we have in-
sight into how he will lead the Agency. 
During Dr. Califf’s previous tenure, 
drug-related overdoses went up. Five 
years later, they are up again—and this 
time at record numbers. In fact, de-
spite his pledge to overhaul the FDA’s 
policy, during his tenure and imme-
diately following it, the FDA approved 
five new opiates for market. In that 
same time, they removed only one. 
The wise Dr. Maya Angelou famously 
said, ‘‘When someone shows you who 
they are, believe them.’’ Well, Dr. 
Califf has shown us who he is, and he 
has shown a complete lack of interest 
in actually making the difficult deci-
sions that we need the leader of the 
FDA to make. Nothing that Dr. Califf 
has said or done has led me to believe 
he will operate the FDA any differently 
than he did during his previous tenure. 
As if this is not enough, reports have 
circulated that Dr. Califf intends to 
keep Dr. Janet Woodcock on board as a 
senior advisor at the FDA if confirmed. 
Dr. Woodcock bears more responsi-
bility for the opiate epidemic in our 
country than any other person at the 
FDA because of her oversight role in 
the approval of every single one of the 
opiates that went on to ravage commu-
nities like ours in West Virginia. 
She was in charge in 1995 when the 
FDA approved OxyContin—what we 
know now to be the tip of the spear of 
the opiate epidemic. In 2014, she ig-
nored the advice of the FDA advisory 
committee that voted overwhelmingly, 
by a vote of 11 to 2, against approving 
Zohydro. 
She 
decided 
to 
approve 
Zohydro anyway at a time when we 
needed less opiates, not more. Zohydro 
is a questionable, pure hydrocodone 
drug with a strong risk of overdose and 
death. Experts estimated that just two 
pure pills can kill an individual. 
The 
pharmaceutical 
industry 
has 
greatly benefited from the status quo 
that people like Dr. Califf and Dr. 
Woodcock have established at the FDA. 
In fact, Dr. Califf himself joined the 
board of directors for a pharmaceutical 
company immediately following his 
tenure at the FDA. He prospered finan-
cially in that position as thousands 
more died of overdoses. 
Due to the continued negligence of 
the FDA, more than 400,000 Americans 
have died since Dr. Califf first served. 
Among those Americans was Lauren 
Cole from Morgantown. Her father Mi-
chael Cole graciously allowed me to 
share Lauren’s story with all of you. 
Lauren was the definition of the girl 
next door: a person who is approach-
able, dependable, and who everyone 
saw as their best friend. She was also a 
fierce competitor with a strong will to 
be the best. 
The little girl who became a competi-
tive athlete was swimming at 2, she 
was tumbling at 3, and she was skiing 
at age 4. In college, she represented 
West Virginia University at the Na-
tional Cheerleaders Association colle-
giate cheer nationals 2 years in a row. 
Everything Lauren did looked effort-
less. After completing her bachelor’s 
degree in social work, she worked with 
foster care and recovering addicts 
while pursuing her master’s degree in 
social work. She had a true helper’s 
heart. 
This life story sounds like a girl who 
had it all, a girl who was happy and 
content. She was beautiful, smart, 
funny, athletic, well liked by her 
friends, and loved deeply by her family. 
She appeared to not have a care in the 
world, but Lauren had been facing an 
epic battle since she was 16. One 
evening, she experimented with pre-
scription opiates with her boyfriend 
and a few friends. She did not plan to 
be an addict. Lauren said once that she 
thought it was recreational like mari-
juana. 
She was embarrassed and fought this 
disease alone for 2 years while main-
taining 
good 
grades, 
excelling 
in 
sports, and taking college courses 
while in high school. She kept this se-
cret from her family, her teachers, her 
coaches, and her friends. 
Toward the end of her first semester 
of college, she had to swallow her pride 
and ask her parents for help. They im-
mediately sent her to a prestigious 
rehab facility and committed to help-
ing her recover. They were willing to 
try every option available to them. 
Lauren was in it for the long haul. 
She had a lot to live for. She was con-
stantly making good choices about 
what she wanted her life to be. After 
all, she was working on her master’s 
degree in social work and knew that 
she could make a difference in the 
world. 
On July 5, 2020, after a 10-year battle 
with substance use disorder, Lauren 
learned that her gym workout partner 
had tested positive for COVID–19. This 
meant that Lauren had to self-quar-
antine until she could be tested. She 
could not work. She could not go to the 
gym. She could not volunteer. She 
could not even visit her family and 
friends. 
She contacted her dad and asked him 
to find a COVID test as soon as pos-
sible. Unfortunately, there were none 
to be found until that Thursday, July 
9. Her dad Michael texted and called 
Lauren all morning and midafternoon 
that day but could not reach her. He 
left work to go to her apartment to tell 
her that he had located COVID tests. 
When he pulled into the parking lot, 
he saw her slumped over in her car. He 
immediately called 9–1-1. He rushed 
over and pulled her out of the car. He 
tried to resuscitate her, but it was too 
late. Lauren had a slipup that took 
away her chance to live up to her full 
potential. It was a sunny afternoon on 
July 9, 2020, when she died of fentanyl 
poisoning at the age of 26—fentanyl, 
which is another approved opiate under 
the FDA. She was alone in her car, hid-
ing from the stigma of addiction. Her 
ability to recover was stolen from her. 
Approximately 3 weeks before Lauren 
relapsed, she came home to talk to her 
dad. She said: Dad, there are so many 
people suffering from addiction who 
need and want help, but they just don’t 
have the resources or a family like 
mine to get it. Do you think that, when 
you retire, we can do something to help 
them? 
Her parents took that wish to heart 
and have created Lauren’s Wish, an or-
ganization working to establish a long- 
term women’s residential substance 
use disorder treatment facility in West

Virginia. Lauren may no longer be 
with us, but her story will continue to 
inspire action and change in West Vir-
ginia and across our Nation. 
Dr. Califf’s nomination is an insult to 
Lauren’s memory and to the millions 
of families who have lost a loved one at 
the hands of this epidemic. I cannot for 
the life of me understand why this ad-
ministration is so committed to asking 
each of us in the Senate to reconfirm a 
person who had the opportunity to 
make a difference but showed us who 
he really was. Do not expect a different 
outcome if he is given another oppor-
tunity to lead the FDA. That won’t 
happen. 
I will vote no on Dr. Califf’s nomina-
tion, and I have never been more pro-
foundly confident of a vote I am going 
to cast than I am right now. I strongly 
urge my colleagues to examine the dev-
astation 
the 
opiate 
epidemic 
has 
wreaked in your home State and on 
your loved ones and those whom you 
know and those of your constituents 
and the lives lost and all the families 
who are left heartbroken and join me 
in voting against Dr. Califf’s confirma-
tion to serve as the Commissioner of 
the FDA and send a message to this ad-
ministration, to our President, that we 
need a new direction at the FDA. We 
need people who want to protect us, 
not people who allow drugs to destroy 
us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
today—I should say, these days—the 
United States is breaking all kinds of 
records and all the wrong kinds. In 
2021, illegal border crossings hit a new 
high, with more than 2 million border 
encounters along our southern border, 
1,200 miles of which is the U.S.-Texas 
border with Mexico. 
Other numbers: the worst inflation in 
the last 40 years, 71⁄2 percent—meaning 
that your paycheck is worth 71⁄2 per-
cent less than it was before this infla-
tion rocket took off. A number of 
major cities are experiencing their 
deadliest year as the murder rates have 
spiked. A combination of inflation, 
open borders, and rising crime rates is 
a dangerous combination. 
Drug overdose deaths reached a grim 
new milestone as well. For the first 
time on record, more than 100,000 
Americans died of drug overdoses dur-
ing a 12-month period. That is 100,000 
families who lost their children, par-
ents, siblings, and loved ones to an en-
tirely preventable cause. 
Our country has been fighting this 
scourge of the opioid epidemic for 
years now. In 2018, we celebrated incre-
mental progress, as overdose deaths 
dropped 4 percent—dropped 4 percent— 
from the previous year, the first de-
crease in three decades. Unfortunately, 
that trend did not last. Overdose 
deaths increased in 2019, and they abso-
lutely skyrocketed in 2020. We are still 
waiting for complete data for 2021, but 
it is not looking good. 
The isolation, the anxiety, and the fi-
nancial stresses of the pandemic have 
taken their toll on virtually every 
American, but our most vulnerable 
friends and neighbors are the ones who 
have been hit particularly hard. On top 
of the physical and financial struggles 
of the pandemic, many individuals are 
battling substance use disorders and 
lost access to treatment centers and 
outreach facilities. 
There has never been a more impor-
tant time for us to examine our re-
sponse to the opioid epidemic and to 
take decisive action to stem the tide. 
Last week, the Commission on Com-
bating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking re-
leased its report, which analyzed the 
state of the synthetic opioid crisis and 
offered recommendations. The Com-
mission referred to illicit synthetic 
opioids as ‘‘a slow motion weapon of 
mass destruction in pill form.’’ Now, 
that may sound a little dramatic until 
you consider how much death and de-
struction this crisis has created. Since 
the Centers for Disease Control began 
collecting overdose data in 1999, more 
than 1 million Americans have died 
from drug overdoses. If you combined 
the number of servicemen who died in 
battles throughout our country’s his-
tory, the number of overdose deaths 
would still be higher. 
We all know there is no silver bullet 
when it comes to addressing this crisis. 
But it is not a matter of diverting il-
licit drugs or stopping overprescription 
or breaking the cycle of addiction; it is 
all of the above. But one of the most 
important places to start is by address-
ing the flow of illegal drugs across our 
border. Reducing the supply of drugs 
that eventually reach our streets is 
critical. 
As we have discussed the crisis at the 
border that has been going on in its 
current form for a year now, I have 
talked about the cascading impact of 
the migration surge. 
Customs and Border Protection de-
serves a lot of credit for their good 
work. The Agency plays a major role 
not just in migration or intercepting 
illegal immigration but also a major 
role in stopping illicit drugs. But when 
thousands of migrants flood our bor-
ders each and every day, their anti- 
drug mission stumbles because, frank-
ly, the cartels know that if they flood 
the zone with so many migrants that 
the Border Patrol has to manage those, 
it leaves open avenues, veritable ave-
nues and expressways across the border 
into the United States to bring in ille-
gal drugs. If Border Patrol is changing 
diapers and passing out meals, as they 
have done throughout this humani-
tarian crisis, they can’t be on the 
frontlines 
combating 
illegal 
drug 
smuggling; they can’t interdict dan-
gerous drugs or deter the cartels from 
moving their poison across our borders. 
One of the most effective ways to 
avoid overdose deaths is to prevent 
those drugs from entering the country 
in the first place, and Customs and 
Border Protection is literally on the 
frontlines of that fight. 
In recent years, Customs and Border 
Protection 
has 
seen 
an 
alarming 
amount of drugs coming across our 
border, one of the most concerning of 
which 
is 
fentanyl. 
Fentanyl 
is 
a 
uniquely dangerous drug because it is 
so potent; it is so strong. Depending on 
a person’s body size, 2 milligrams can 
be lethal. A kilogram of fentanyl, 2.2 
pounds, could kill 500,000 people—2.2 
pounds of fentanyl could kill half a 
million people. 
A few years ago, CBP seized about 
2,800 pounds of fentanyl in a year. The 
next year, it jumped to 4,800 pounds. 
The following year, Customs and Bor-
der 
Protection 
seized 
more 
11,200 
pounds of fentanyl, enough to wipe out 
the entire U.S. population many times 
over. That is how potent it is. 
Once it reaches the United States, 
this synthetic opioid, fentanyl, often 
makes its way into other substances, 
such as in combination with meth-
amphetamine and heroin, which, too, 
can also lead to deadly consequences. 
Cities across America are experi-
encing waves of overdose deaths caused 
by 
counterfeit 
opioids 
laced 
with 
fentanyl. In Texas, authorities recently 
seized more than 100,000 counterfeit 
pills laced with fentanyl—a haul with a 
street value of more than a million dol-
lars. 
Mexico, our neighbor to the south, is 
the principal source of illicit fentanyl, 
and unfortunately the Biden adminis-
tration has made it incredibly easy for 
the drug cartels to ply their trade. 
Now, it is true that many of the pre-
cursors to make that fentanyl come 
from places like China, but ultimately 
it ends up ending in Mexico and mak-
ing its way into the United States. 
As the border crisis has grown to un-
precedented proportions, it has become 
easier for fentanyl, heroin, and other 
illicit drugs to cross the border and 
reach 
communities 
throughout 
our 
country. There is a beyond-urgent need 
for the administration to address the 
border crisis—not just to stem illegal 
immigration, not just to stop criminals 
from preying on our country by mixing 
among economic migrants and making 
their way into the country; it is also 
about stopping the trade in illegal 
drugs that are literally killing men, 
women, and children in communities 
all across our country. 
Until action is taken to alleviate the 
humanitarian crisis and get the Border 
Patrol back on the frontlines, we are 
not going to make a lot of progress. We 
have to stop the drug cartels and 
criminal organizations in their tracks, 
and we can’t do that if law enforce-
ment officers are on diaper duty. 
We need a comprehensive approach to 
address this crisis and address addi-
tional support for those who are al-
ready struggling with addiction. 
Last year, the Senate passed a bipar-
tisan bill that I introduced with Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE, the Senator from 
Rhode Island, called the Residential 
Substance Use Disorder Treatment Act 
in order to help incarcerated individ-
uals break the cycle of addiction and

transition safely and productively back 
into society. This legislation updates 
the residential substance abuse treat-
ment program and expands access to 
treatment in jails and prisons across 
the country. The program already pro-
vides incarcerated individuals with ac-
cess to treatment for substance use dis-
orders. That treatment is coupled with 
programs to prepare them for reentry 
and provide community-based treat-
ment once they are released. The 
changes included in this current legis-
lation will give incarcerated men and 
women the best possible shot at living 
healthier and more productive lives 
once they are released. 
I am sure it is no surprise that this 
bill has strong support both here in the 
Senate and among outside organiza-
tions that do a lot of good work in this 
area. More than two dozen organiza-
tions have endorsed this bill, including 
those in law enforcement, criminal jus-
tice, and behavioral health. 
The bill passed the Senate with unan-
imous support last year, but it is still 
lingering on the House calendar. It is 
unclear when or if Speaker PELOSI and 
House Democrats will allow this bill to 
pass so we can invest crucial resources 
in the fight against drug abuse. 
There are a number of challenges 
that we face that transcend politics 
here in Congress and inside the belt-
way, and this definitely is one of them. 
Fighting the opioid epidemic is a cause 
everyone in this Chamber should get 
behind because each of our States and 
indeed the entire country have been 
impacted. Families across my State 
and the rest of the 49 States have lost 
children, parents, siblings, and friends 
to the opioid epidemic. In 2020 alone, 
we lost more than 4,000 of my fellow 
Texans to drug overdoses. Unless we 
take action to thwart the slow-motion 
weapon of mass destruction, our com-
munities will face even more suffering 
and more deaths. 
I am tired of the pain and suffering 
the opioid epidemic has inflicted on 
families across the country. I am 
angry. I am fed up. And I believe we 
need a call to action because there is 
an urgent need to address drug addic-
tion in America. I am committed to 
being part of the solution, and I would 
hope every Member of Congress in the 
House and the Senate, Republicans and 
Democrats alike, would join us in be-
coming a part of the solution. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
have come to the floor of the Senate 
many times over the last several years 
to discuss an aspect of higher edu-
cation only few people even know ex-
ists. The so-called for-profit colleges. 
This disgraceful industry enrolls 8 
percent of all postsecondary students 
in America—8 percent—and yet ac-
counts for 30 percent of all Federal stu-
dent loan defaults. Those two numbers 
tell the story. For-profit colleges get 8 
percent of the students and are respon-
sible for 30 percent of the student loan 
defaults. Why? For obvious reasons. 
They are too expensive. They charge a 
higher tuition than community col-
leges or even many private colleges. 
Secondly, the students don’t end up 
finishing because they get mired in 
debt. And third, if they end up with a 
degree, it turns out to be virtually 
worthless. 
When I think of cases that we have 
looked into in Illinois, in Chicago, of 
the exploitation of well-meaning stu-
dents, sometimes the first in their fam-
ilies to go to college, who are lured in 
by the siren song of the marketing of 
for-profit colleges—they sign up, sign 
all the papers, turn over all their Pell 
grants, then sign up for Federal stu-
dent loans and other private loans and 
have a disastrous experience where 
they can’t even finish. They are so 
deeply in debt or, if they finish, they 
find their degree was worthless. 
How many of those young people I re-
member coming to me and saying: I 
was majoring in law enforcement, and I 
was getting this degree from one of the 
local for-profit colleges to go into law 
enforcement. And you know what, Sen-
ator? They laughed at me when they 
saw the name of the school: That isn’t 
a real school; that isn’t a real degree. 
Senator—they tell me—it is a real 
debt. 
And that is the reality of these for- 
profit colleges. 
I have called for greater oversight of 
this industry, as they exploit these stu-
dents and their families. We have 
called out some of the most vicious 
predatory players in the industry like 
Corinthian, 
University 
of 
Phoenix, 
DeVry, ITT Tech, Westwood—institu-
tions that are more likely to lead stu-
dents into a lifetime of debt rather 
than a lifetime of opportunity. 
Now, just imagine, if you will, that 
one of the leading architects of this 
fraudulent industry was chosen to be 
one of its watchdogs by the Federal 
Government. Well, that is the situation 
we have today. Dr. Arthur Keiser, who 
embodies the worst of the for-profit in-
dustry, is the chairman of the board of 
for-profit Southeastern College. He is 
also chancellor and CEO of Keiser Uni-
versity, a so-called nonprofit univer-
sity that he converted from for-profit 
status in the year 2011. This so-called 
conversion to not-for-profit is mis-
leading. The overlap between South-
eastern College and Keiser University 
is well established. For example, mul-
tiple executives at Keiser University 
are also executives at Southeastern. 
An IRS filing shows that executives 
at Keiser University, a supposedly non-
profit school, are paid hundreds of 
thousands of dollars each year. You 
know when you hear the term ‘‘not-for- 
profit,’’ you think of charitable insti-
tutions, people just barely making 
enough to get by, service to principles 
and values. Well, Mr. Keiser and his 
gang have turned that upside down. 
They make hundreds of thousands of 
dollars each year, a hefty salary for 
part-time employees working for a 
nonprofit college. 
Arthur Keiser is also notorious for 
shady dealings. I am not making this 
up or going to a source of fake news for 
it. These were detailed in a GAO report 
last year. For example, in the year 
after Keiser University was converted 
into a not-for-profit college—not-for- 
profit—the school paid out more than 
$34 million to members of Mr. Keiser’s 
family—$34 million? That is right, to 
Arthur Keiser’s family. Not bad for a 
not-for-profit venture. 
Arthur Keiser’s financial misdeeds 
are so grave, so serious, that his own 
mother has filed a lawsuit against him 
over shifty financial handlings of the 
colleges that they cofounded. This 
would be a dramatic situation comedy 
were it not for the victims, the stu-
dents. 
Rather than being chastised by this 
GAO report and lawsuit by his mom, 
Mr. Keiser is now seeking to dramati-
cally extend his influence within the 
for-profit college industry. How exactly 
is he planning to do this? Lucky for Ar-
thur, the power is already in his hands. 
Today, Arthur Keiser serves as chair 
of the National Advisory Committee on 
Institutional Quality and Integrity, 
also known as NACIQI. I have never 
heard of it, but those in the industry 
know it quite well. NACIQI is the De-
partment of Education’s Federal advi-
sory board that approves the creditors 
who act as gatekeepers for Federal stu-
dent dollars. So in order to offer a Fed-
eral student loan, the Department of 
Education has to first establish that 
you are a real school—I mean, a real 
school with real teachers and class-
rooms or some other means of teaching 
students and that your degree is being 
presented to you in real terms, whether 
it is really going to help your life. This 
NACIQI is the watchdog of all the Fed-
eral watchdogs when it comes to for- 
profits. And guess who is the Chair: Ar-
thur Keiser. 
As Chair of NACIQI, Arthur Keiser 
poses a systematic threat to student 
borrowers. His chairmanship is a major 
conflict of interest in NACIQI’s vital 
role of maintaining integrity of Fed-
eral student aid. 
For-profits are already one of the 
most heavily subsidized sectors in 
America. I took a look at what these 
companies, these for-profit colleges, 
were taking out of the Federal Treas-
ury. They put some of the worst Fed-
eral contractors to shame. And of 
course, they often leave students sad-
dled with debts they will never be able 
to pay for worthless degrees. 
Now, naturally, you may wonder, 
how do these for-profits spend all the 
Federal dollars sent their way?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S660 
February 14, 2022 
Well, this is what it is all about. 
They spend millions on advertising 
their worthless degrees to underprivi-
leged students. 
There was an ad that was running 
out here a couple years ago, one of my 
favorites 
from 
the 
for-profits. 
It 
showed this young lady; she couldn’t 
have been more than 19 years of age. 
And she was lounging in her bedroom 
with her laptop on the bed next to her, 
talking about how she was going to 
college in her pajamas. I am not mak-
ing this up. 
They spend millions of dollars just 
like that, advertising to young people 
who may not know any better that you 
have to put in a real effort to get an 
education. It pays off, but it doesn’t 
come to you sitting in your pajamas. 
Instead of reforming the for-profit 
advertising model, Dr. Keiser is ex-
panding it. He likes this marketing. He 
has applied some of the same predatory 
practices to the so-called nonprofit col-
lege space. 
In 
2017, 
Keiser 
University—aptly 
named after himself—which Dr. Keiser 
claims is nonprofit, racked up the sec-
ond largest advertising bill of any pri-
vate nonprofit institution. 
Keiser University spent nearly one- 
fifth of its entire budget on ads and 
marketing—more than $82 million. 
We found some of the colleges that 
have been investigated in the past were 
spending more money on advertising 
than they were on faculty salaries. And 
it showed. 
For the sake of comparison, other 
nonprofit colleges—real nonprofit col-
leges—are estimated to spend 1.5 per-
cent to 6 percent of their budget on 
marketing. Dr. Arthur Keiser, his uni-
versity spent almost 20 percent. 
Southeastern College, Dr. Keiser’s 
for-profit school, reported in 2018 to the 
IRS that 87 percent of its annual rev-
enue came from student aid. That is 
close to the 90-percent cap imposed by 
the 90–10 rule. What does that mean in 
the big picture? It means this is just a 
conduit. Follow, if you will, the proc-
ess. The student sits in the admissions 
office, and the admissions officer says, 
We are ready to launch. We are ready 
to put you in the courses. All you have 
to do is sign this. Here is your con-
tract, the contract where you are going 
to seek Federal student aid. 
The student signs it, naturally. Got 
my Pell grant. Got my Federal student 
aid. It is all going to the for-profit 
school. Then what happens next? Well, 
the student has got the debt to pay 
back for the loan. The school gets the 
cash. The school turns around—Dr. 
Keiser turns around and has a big dis-
tribution party, and the student finds 
out 6 months later it is a worthless un-
dertaking, but they have still got the 
debt to pay. 
And unless some action is taken by 
the Department of Education that 
proves up fraud and releases that stu-
dent from his obligation, that is going 
to be a debt he is going to carry for 
years. It is going to change his life. 
Do Dr. Keiser and his gang care? 
They have got their money. They have 
distributed it among themselves. Dr. 
Keiser has also demonstrated question-
able conduct as chair of NACIQI, name-
ly, protecting his own interests at the 
expense of students and taxpayers. 
This is a real fox in the chicken coop. 
In 2020, under Dr. Keiser’s leadership, 
NACIQI wrongfully penalized the High-
er Learning Commission, an accreditor 
that tried to rescind accreditation 
from two fraudulent for-profits. Just 
last year, Dr. Keiser was forced to 
recuse himself from the review of Ac-
crediting 
Commission 
of 
Career 
Schools and Colleges—or ACCSC. 
Why exactly did he have to recuse 
himself? Because this organization ac-
credited his college, so he was putting 
the pressure on that entity. 
And in Dr. Keiser’s absence, the 
other NACIQI members rightly consid-
ered student outcomes in determining 
whether they would continue as an 
accreditor. But when Dr. Keiser re-
turned from recusal, he chastised the 
same members for having the gall to 
prioritize the needs of students. 
So even when he was forced to recuse 
himself, Dr. Arthur Keiser found a way 
to use his position as Chair to advance 
his own interest. This week, I am going 
to lead a letter with SHERROD BROWN, 
my colleague from Ohio, requesting the 
Department of Education finally take a 
hard look at Arthur Keiser’s Chairman-
ship and his obvious conflicts of inter-
est. 
It is worth noting that we are not 
alone in raising these concerns about 
Dr. Arthur Keiser. 
Earlier this month, the House Edu-
cation and Labor Committee chairman, 
BOBBY SCOTT of Virginia, also raised 
the issue of Keiser’s manipulative con-
version of his for-profit college to non-
profit status. 
Time and again, Arthur Keiser has 
put his own personal priorities over the 
needs of the students and taxpayers he 
is supposed to serve. His conflicts of in-
terest have become abundantly clear, 
and now it is time for the Department 
of Education to put an end to this 
party. 
Last month, Secretary Cardona an-
nounced 
the 
Department 
of 
Edu-
cation’s priorities. One of them is hold-
ing 
postsecondary 
institutions 
ac-
countable for taking advantage of kids. 
Right now, the Department of Edu-
cation has an opportunity to uphold 
that 
priority 
by 
bringing 
Arthur 
Keiser’s nefarious conduct to an end. 
We are going to be watching. On behalf 
of those students and their families, on 
behalf of colleges and universities that 
do a good job, we have got to put an 
end to this rip-off. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, last week, most of my friends on 
the left pretended to be shocked by a 
new CNN poll that proved what a lot of 
Tennesseans have known for quite a 
while, and it is that Joe Biden and his 
agenda with the Biden administration 
is truly upside down with the American 
people. 
Here is what we found out: Fifty- 
eight percent of the American people 
disapprove of the way he is handling 
his job as President. That alone is real-
ly an indictment on what they have 
been putting forward, but it gets a lit-
tle bit worse. Sixty-two percent dis-
approve of how he has mishandled the 
economy. 
Fifty-seven percent think his ap-
proach to fighting crime is not work-
ing. They believe that because they are 
seeing it in their streets in their home-
towns. 
Fifty-five percent don’t like how he 
is responding to Xi Jinping. Fifty-six 
percent are worried about how he is 
handling Putin, and I am sure that 
number, in particular, will go up before 
the next poll comes out. 
These numbers are brutal, but here is 
the cherry on top. Fifty-seven percent 
believe Biden’s first year in office has 
been a total failure; and when asked 
whether or not Joe Biden’s government 
represents the views of people like 
themselves, 68 percent of the people 
polled said, No, Joe Biden and his ad-
ministration 
do 
not 
represent 
my 
views. 
It is pretty simple—the American 
people are not buying what Joe Biden 
and this administration are selling. 
And the people in the White House 
seem to put their hands up, and they 
just cannot figure this out. They can’t 
understand why the people won’t just 
shut up and do what they are told. 
Here is the secret: It is because when 
the people look at Washington—when 
Tennesseans look at Washington, and 
they look at who is in charge of our 
government—and Democrats have con-
trol of the House, the Senate, the 
White House—all they see is an empty 
suit with an agenda. 
There is no vision, but there is agen-
da. They have got the to-do list. They 
have got the list of boxes they need to 
check off. We killed the Keystone Pipe-
line. We put mandates in place. We 
have got people in masks. We have got 
people in lockdowns. They are going to 
lose their job if they don’t go get a jab. 
They have got an agenda. 
For all of his bluster about fun-
damentally transforming our way of 
life, all Joe Biden has managed to do is 
to alienate his fellow countrymen. 
Now, his allies are trying to turn the 
tide by revamping their talking points. 
But here is the problem: It won’t work, 
because this administration—the Biden 
administration—does not have a mes-
saging problem. Their problem is their 
agenda that they have that is lack-
luster with no vision. 
But the American people are paying 
attention to this. And you know what 
they are seeing? I have to tell you, it 
really frightens them. It frightens 
them. 
Doesn’t matter if I go to one of the 
grandkids’ ballgames, go to church, go

to the grocery store, run some errands, 
I am hearing from people what they see 
happening. The cramdown, the control, 
it frightens them. 
And there is no distracting them 
from the fact that the President is 
weaponizing 
this 
liberal 
wish 
list 
against what they have as the vision 
for their future, for their children, for 
their family. 
For the past year, Tennesseans have 
watched Biden dodge and weave and ig-
nore what the people are telling him— 
the people are telling him. Democrats 
in Washington have treated their polit-
ical rivals like enemies and accused 
them of racism, treachery, all for the 
crime of drawing a line in the sand and 
saying no. 
It is amazing. I wish some of my col-
leagues did want to stand up for free-
dom. The people deserve better than 
that. And I will tell you what, they 
know it. No talking point is going to 
convince them to tolerate the intoler-
able from their government. And, yes, 
inflation, mandates, lockdowns, the 
open border, crime in the street, the 
debacle of Afghanistan, problems with 
Russia, the situation with Russia, 
Ukraine, China, Iran, the list grows 
every single day—every single day. 
It is the wrong agenda. As I said, it 
lacks vision. At the beginning of these 
remarks, I said that the liberals pre-
tended to be shocked by Biden’s ter-
rible poll numbers, and I stand by that 
statement because the truth is the 
White 
House, 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues, and their allies in the media 
know that they are kind of circling the 
drain when it comes to what they are 
pushing forward on the people. 
But for some reason, they think that 
just one more power grab is going to do 
the trick. It will be the magic bullet. 
That certainly is a tactic, but it also 
will fail because the people know that 
it is the people of this country that 
have built this country. And it is built 
on a foundation that treasures faith, 
family, 
freedom, 
hope, 
and 
oppor-
tunity. 
And if you have got an agenda and a 
checklist and a to-do list, but you have 
no vision for a better future, the Amer-
ican people will not buy what you are 
selling. 
I yield the floor. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the clo-
ture motions filed on Thursday, Feb-
ruary 10, ripen at 5:45 p.m. today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 2497 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, on Feb-
ruary 19, 1942—and that will be 80 years 
ago this coming Saturday—President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive 
Order 9066, authorizing the blatantly 
racist mass incarceration of essentially 
all Japanese Americans inside the 
United States at the time. This was an 
indefensible move—one that resulted in 
locking up about 120,000 decent, hard- 
working, innocent people based on 
nothing other than their race. 
Two years later, in one of the most 
shameful moments in America’s judi-
cial history, the U.S. Supreme Court 
deferred to the Roosevelt administra-
tion’s blatantly racist and equally un-
constitutional imprisonment of Japa-
nese Americans. Writing for the major-
ity in a case called Korematsu v. 
United States, Associate Justice Hugo 
Black, a Justice with a history of big-
otry, unconscionably glossed over the 
countless 
constitutional 
violations 
built into the race-based interment of 
innocent American citizens, who the 
Court acknowledged ‘‘were loyal to 
this country overwhelmingly,’’ based 
on the fact that ‘‘[t]here was evidence 
of disloyalty on the part of some’’ Jap-
anese Americans and ‘‘military au-
thorities considered that the need for 
action was great.’’ 
In a moment one might expect from 
someone like Justice Black, who had a 
history of bigotry, he cavalierly dis-
missed the blatant racism inherent in 
this action, reasoning that ‘‘[t]o cast 
this case into outlines of racial preju-
dice, without reference to the real 
military dangers which were presented, 
merely confuses the issue.’’ 
Tragically, Justice Black, blinded 
perhaps by his own intolerance and big-
otry or perhaps by his loyalty to the 
President who had appointed him just 
a few years earlier, missed the obvious 
point: Racial prejudice was the issue. 
That was the whole point. I agree with 
the characterization later provided by 
now-Chief Justice Roberts, just a few 
years ago, in 2018, when he noted that 
‘‘Korematsu was gravely wrong the day 
it was decided, [and] has been overruled 
in the court of history, and—to be 
clear—’has no place in the law under 
the Constitution.’’’ 
No person should ever be in prison 
solely due to their race. It shouldn’t be 
even a factor in anyone’s imprison-
ment—certainly not in the United 
States of America. 
Japanese internment is one of the 
very worst examples—one of the very 
worst examples—of our government re-
jecting its founding principles. It is 
something that should be remembered 
so that it can never be repeated. De-
spite this mistreatment by govern-
ment, 
Japanese 
Americans 
served 
faithfully in many capacities during 
World War II and have continued to 
serve our Nation and their commu-
nities in irreplaceable ways. Their con-
tributions are worthy of remembrance 
and celebration. 
Regrettably, the United States has 
failed to meet other, admittedly, far 
less fundamental obligations it has 
made to individuals and to States. One 
of those obligations is relevant here, 
ironically arising in the context of an 
effort to honor victims of FDR’s in-
ternment of Japanese Americans. The 
Federal 
Government 
has 
neglected 
commitments made by Congress to 
Western States at the time of their ad-
mission to dispose of large swaths of 
Federal land. Similar promises had 
been made to most States that were 
admitted into the Union ever since the 
Louisiana Purchase. But for the fact 
that Congress honored such promises 
with respect to a lot of these States, 
including States like Illinois and Mis-
souri, the Federal Government would 
still, to this day, own around 90 percent 
of those States. The same could be said 
of many, many others. 
Although Utah received such assur-
ances from Congress prior to its admis-
sion into the Union in 1896, using essen-
tially identical language, Utah is still 
waiting for the Federal Government to 
honor its end of the bargain. However, 
unlike States like Illinois and Mis-
souri, which received the benefit of the 
Federal bargain, Utah did not. The 
Federal Government still owns more 
than two-thirds of all the land in my 
State, resulting in an extraordinary 
amount of environmental, economic, 
and 
educational 
consequences 
that 
hurt Utahns, particularly those Utahns 
in poor and rural communities. 
In fact, in a blatant insult to the peo-
ple whose families settled and devel-
oped much of the rural West and their 
communities, the Federal Government 
continues to limit and restrict access, 
commerce, mining, drilling, and graz-
ing on land it had promised to relin-
quish. Rural farms, industries, and 
communities are shrinking and dying 
because of this continually broken 
promise. 
To add insult to injury, the Feds rou-
tinely fail to care properly for the land 
in their portfolio. The maintenance 
backlog in the National Park System 
is years long and $12 billion in the hole. 
The Bureau of Land Management con-
trols vast swaths of the Western United 
States, and it controls them from 
Washington, DC, with little interest or 
regard for the people whose livelihoods 
and way of life depend on that land. 
This relationship remains a vexing 
problem for everyday life in Utah. 
Businesses are shuttered because the 
Federal Government capriciously halts 
mineral extraction authority. Ranches 
go bankrupt because the Bureau of 
Land Management ends grazing rights 
in areas where families have raised cat-
tle for generations. And just last week, 
Federal land managers damaged an ex-
quisite collection of dinosaur fossils 
and would have continued doing so but 
for the intervention of a noble citizen 
named Jeremy Roberts, who was will-
ing to call them out on it. 
At a time when the Federal Govern-
ment already owns far more land than 
it can manage, Congress should be real-
ly cautious about decreasing Federal 
land holdings. It should be going out of 
its way to decrease its Federal land 
holdings and doing that rather than in-
creasing them. Recognition of sites 
like the Amache camp deserve better 
than Federal management. However, if

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S662 
February 14, 2022 
those representing the State of Colo-
rado think the Federal Government 
can do better or, for whatever reason, 
just want it to be under the National 
Park’s jurisdiction rather than subject 
to local control, then I am not inclined 
to argue with them. 
What I would like to ask is that this 
land not continue to be acquired by the 
Federal Government with no plan in 
sight for dealing with the size of the 
Federal footprint. It is the size of the 
overall Federal land estate that wor-
ries me because the Federal Govern-
ment has not proven a good steward of 
what it has got. So if we keep adding to 
that, it is only going to perpetuate 
some of these problems. 
Now, I have been wrongfully por-
trayed by some in the media as being 
somehow against this historical rec-
ognition and against commemorating, 
as a warning to future generations and 
to honor the victims of the past, one of 
this Nation’s and its government’s 
most tragic missteps. I continue to ne-
gotiate in good faith to find a way for-
ward with this bill. I have been in com-
munication with the lead sponsor in 
the House, and I think there are ways 
that we can address this—to address 
both goals at issue. 
I think we need to be able to com-
memorate these events and we also 
need to do so in a way that won’t lead 
to the unfettered expansion of the Fed-
eral land footprint. 
So, Madam President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 255, H.R. 2497. I further ask 
that the Lee amendment at the desk be 
considered and agreed to; that the com-
mittee-reported amendments be agreed 
to; that the bill, as amended, be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I strongly 
disagree with Senator LEE’s proposal 
amending what has been agreed to—not 
agreed to but what has gotten every 
single Member of the Senate but for 
one. I want to also say that I was on 
the floor about 10 days ago, I think, on 
the subject of this. I want the Chair 
and the Senator from Utah to know I 
didn’t even mention who had objected 
while I was here, but it was 1 out of 100 
Senators. This bill passed the House of 
Representatives with all but two votes. 
It passed with every single vote from 
the Colorado delegation, and we have 
this gamut of people in from Colorado. 
The bill is strongly supported by my 
friend KEN BUCK, whom I ran against in 
2010. And if KEN were here, he would 
say there is very little upon which we 
agree. I hope there is more than he 
thinks we agree on, but we definitely 
agree on this. 
So let me just explain why we wrote 
this bill. In 5 days, as the Senator from 
Utah has said, we are going to mark 
the 80th anniversary of Executive 
Order No. 9066, which began the forced 
dispossession and internment of over 
120,000 
Japanese 
Americans 
during 
World War II. Two-thirds of them were 
citizens of this country, American citi-
zens, forced out of their homes into 
camps by our own government—by 
their own. 
One of those camps was Amache on 
the Eastern Plains of Colorado, where 
the Federal Government detained near-
ly 10,000 Japanese Americans against 
their will. Most of them had less than 
a week—most of them had less than a 
week—to get rid of virtually every-
thing they owned and crowd onto buses 
and trains with no idea where they 
were going or what was going to hap-
pen to them. 
Some of the first arrivals at Amache 
were kids younger than the pages who 
are on the floor here today with us, 
who were forced to build the camp 
where their own families were interred 
during the duration of the war. The 
conditions were horrible. Walls didn’t 
always reach the ceilings. The windows 
weren’t always sealed. It meant that 
snow blew in during the winter, and 
dust blew in during the summer. 
This is what our government did to 
our fellow Americans, to children, 
forced to work in the fields to grow 
their own food in the jail that the 
United States of America had com-
mitted them to. And what is even more 
remarkable is that despite this treat-
ment, 1 out of 10 of the people at 
Amache still volunteered to serve dur-
ing the war—a higher rate than any 
other camp in America. Think about 
that. They were willing to defend the 
very government that was detaining 
them, that had locked up their chil-
dren. That is how much they believed 
in America, even when America turned 
our back on them. 
And I had the opportunity to visit 
Amache a few years ago with John 
Hopper, a high school principal in Gre-
nada who worked with his students to 
create the Amache Preservation Soci-
ety. They have been taking care of this 
site themselves all of these years, col-
lecting items from all over the world 
that former prisoners have sent back 
because they want people to remember. 
They want a memorial to their cap-
tivity. Year after year, these high 
school students and their teacher have 
worked to restore this site so that the 
next generation of Coloradans can 
learn about what happened there. 
If it were up to me, every student in 
Colorado and throughout the American 
West would go there—throughout our 
entire country—and learn about the 
Americans of Amache, the men and 
women who held on to hope year after 
year, who supported one another, who 
forged a community behind the barbed 
wire of this site, who never gave up on 
the United States of America, even as 
it was interning them on their own 
soil. 
After I visited this site, I introduced 
a bill with Senator HICKENLOOPER to 
make Amache a part of the National 
Park System so it would have the re-
sources and recognition it deserves for 
years to come. We have to get this 
done because the survivors of Amache 
are growing fewer and fewer in number 
each year, and we have to keep the 
memory of what they went through 
alive for the next generation. 
That is what Colorado wants. I have 
a list of over 70 groups that support it, 
from the Asian Chamber of Commerce 
to the Colorado Council of Churches, to 
the town of Grenada, which owns the 
site today. 
So, Madam President, I ask unani-
mous consent to have this list printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Mr. BENNET. Madam President, this

February 14, 2022 
and it wasn’t controversial in the 
House, where Republican Congressman 
KEN BUCK, whose district this is, took 
up the bill with JOE NEGUSE, a neigh-
boring Congressman. Amache is in the 
10th District in Prowers County, and I 
said that the bill passed the House by 
416 to 2. 
It wasn’t controversial in the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee, where it passed with bipartisan 
support from the chairman and rank-
ing member, and that is why I came 
here 2 weeks ago to pass the bill by 
unanimous consent. But now there has 
been an objection. 
And I should mention, by the way, 
that this site is less than 1 square mile. 
It is a tiny, tiny fraction of even the 
county that it is in. It seems to me 
that if we believe in federalism at all, 
we shouldn’t be blocking Colorado’s 
right to preserve less than 1 square 
mile the way we see fit; that we 
shouldn’t have to reduce the public 
lands of the United States by an equal 
amount. And I will say, in that connec-
tion, that I formally object to the Sen-
ator from Utah’s motion for this rea-
son. The land here is owned by Gre-
nada. It is already public land. The 
town has said it wants to donate it to 
the National Park Service. 
I have a letter from the town making 
this intention perfectly clear. 
So it is not even private land that is 
becoming public. It is public land 
transitioning from a local government 
to the Federal Government at the re-
quest of the community. 
And they are not asking for anything 
in return. And I think that is an impor-
tant point that the Senator from Utah 
has raised. And we have worked with 
the town to show that they are not 
asking for an exchange. They want to 
donate the land as their patriotic con-
tribution to America to protect this 
part of our history. 
I would think all of us here should 
agree that, unless it is hurting some-
body else, the town can do whatever it 
likes with its own land, just like a pri-
vate landowner can do with their own 
land. 
Let me stop there and see whether 
the Senator from Utah has any reac-
tion to that. 
I will formally object to his motion, 
and I will stop there. I have got other 
things to say, but I hope that maybe 
we can get to an agreement based on 
what I would offer. So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I have a 
couple of points, and I don’t think we 
are far off in where we are on this. 
It is true that it is not an expansive 
land that is as big as some other land 
transfers we see—1 square mile. On the 
one hand, a lot of people would regard 
that as large—640 acres. It is the acre-
age equivalent of 1 square mile. 
I would note here that I wouldn’t call 
it a federalism argument in that we 
have to allow this. There are Federal 
implications to this that extend far be-
yond what a local unit of government 
might want to do. What happens is, 
when you transfer it into the Federal 
estate, we do incur additional obliga-
tions to make sure that that land is 
maintained 
and 
managed 
appro-
priately. It does cost money, and it 
takes an expense off the books of those 
who would otherwise be maintaining it. 
So it is not without any consequence 
at all. In other words, it is a matter of 
a simple operation of federalism to say 
that we should allow this in this cir-
cumstance. 
I would note, moreover, that we have 
come closer on this. The amendment 
that I offered a moment ago that my 
friend and colleague, the Senator from 
Colorado, objected to is one that would 
allow this to happen but would require 
an offset to be made by the appropriate 
Federal land managers within 1 year of 
the transfer of this land. 
There is nothing about that that 
strikes me as being particularly objec-
tionable, particularly given the fact 
that the Federal Government owns and 
manages about 30 percent of the land 
mass in the United States. In my State 
and in Colorado, it is much more than 
that. There is nothing about that that 
should be particularly objectionable. 
With that said, the Senator from Col-
orado has shaped this legislation in a 
meaningful way, and because I have a 
desire to honor those victims of this 
horrific event in American history and 
the Senator from Colorado has offered 
up a separate solution, one that would 
involve donation rather than acquisi-
tion by the Federal Government, al-
though that also raises some con-
cerns—over time, I think we have to 
watch this because the more we en-
hance the Federal land footprint, the 
more difficult it will be for the Federal 
Government to keep up with the main-
tenance backlog. 
But given that this doesn’t directly 
impact concerns quite the way those 
same concerns might be implicated if 
we were having to purchase it at the 
outset, I would be inclined, if my friend 
from Colorado were interested in offer-
ing that amendment, to withhold any 
objection from that while noting that 
it is my hope and expectation that, in 
moving forward, we could be more 
aware of these issues and that, as we 
see the Federal land footprint increas-
ing, we can take steps as a body to 
make sure that there is some natural 
stopping point even before we turn to 
what I believe we have still got to turn 
to, which is the commitment made at 
statehood that still needs to be hon-
ored. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. I thank, through the 
Chair, the Senator from Utah. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 255, H.R. 2497. Further, I ask that 
the Bennet amendment at the desk be 
considered and agreed to; that the com-
mittee-reported amendments be agreed 
to; that the bill, as amended, be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, this 
is all happening on the fly right now, 
so I am actually going to withdraw 
that in the spirit of what Senator LEE 
has said. Hopefully, we can do this 
later today. We need to make sure that 
everybody has the benefit of seeing the 
language, and then we will be back 
later to do this. 
I thank the Senator from Utah, and I 
will spare him the rest of my speech 
except that I think he deserves to hear 
this, and I think everybody here de-
serves to hear this, which is, when the 
ENR Committee took this legislation 
up this fall, here is what the survivors 
from Amache wrote to the committee, 
and I just want to put their words into 
the RECORD before I withdraw: 
During World War II, we were forced to live 
as prisoners in our own country. Along with 
our parents, we were forced from our homes, 
tagged like animals, and sent to the desolate 
prairie of southeast Colorado, where we lived 
in trauma, a constant presence of armed 
guards, barbed wire, and suffering too large 
to describe in one correspondence. Our fami-
lies suffered a loss of jobs, homes, property, 
and businesses, and many of us lost family 
members. Many of our parents went to their 
graves without even an apology from their 
country. Our nation still has a long way to 
go to learn from this mistake, and our com-
munity, both old and young, continues to 
suffer from anti-Asian hate crimes, increas-
ing to this day. Our national parks and the 
stories they honor reflect our values as a na-
tion. Adding Amache to the National Park 
System would allow us to protect a unique 
story that has largely been forgotten and 
can only be told through the power of place. 
With each year that passes, there are fewer 
of us. We are counting on you to see us 
through. 
Because of the discussion we have 
had tonight, we are going to have the 
chance later to be able to do that. 
I thank my friend from Utah. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that after Sen-
ator SCOTT speaks and blocks the pro-
posal, that I speak, Senator PETERS 
speaks, and then Senator MURRAY 
speaks on the Califf nomination and 
that then we move forward on the clo-
ture vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The majority leader. 
RETURN OF PAPERS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate agree to the request of the House to 
return the papers with respect to H.R. 
3076 and that when the Senate receives 
from the House the corrected engross-
ment of the bill, it be in the same pro-
cedural posture as it was at the time of 
the granting of this request.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S664 
February 14, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object, let 
me first say that I care deeply about 
fixing the problems with the U.S. Post-
al Service. The Postal Service provides 
an essential service and touches the 
lives of nearly every American. The 
Postal Service also consumes billions 
in taxpayer and consumer money every 
year, meaning that it has to be ac-
countable to taxpayers and consumers 
not only in how effectively it delivers 
but in how it spends the dollars it re-
ceives. So I absolutely support getting 
something done to reform the Postal 
Service and ensure it is more account-
able to taxpayers and consumers. 
I also support provisions of this bill, 
like its focus on enhanced services for 
rural communities, which will benefit 
many families across my great State, 
and I like the fact that it maintains 
the current 6-day mail delivery sched-
ule. Unfortunately, there are also 
pieces of this bill that set us back and 
block the opportunity for us to achieve 
our shared goal of responsibly reform-
ing the Postal Service. 
What I am asking for here is not un-
reasonable. I simply want the Senate 
to have the opportunity to work on 
this, improve it, and deliver a bill that 
truly works. 
The Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs has ju-
risdiction over the Postal Service. I am 
actually very proud to serve on this 
committee. Unfortunately, the com-
mittee has not held one hearing or 
member meeting on the bill, nor has 
the bill even been considered at a 
markup. 
We aren’t here considering just a 
simple resolution. This is a massive, 
multibillion-dollar bill that has huge 
impacts on Medicare recipients, and 
the Democratic majority skipped the 
committee process and rushed the bill 
to the floor. 
Despite the rushed process through-
out the bill, a few details need to be 
highlighted, and they are not pretty. 
First, as I said before, this bill does 
not fix the underlying issues with the 
Postal Service, nor does it make it 
profitable. I don’t understand why the 
Postal Service loses money and cannot 
be profitable. I don’t think many 
Americans understand why. 
America is more than $30 trillion in 
debt. We can’t afford to add more 
stress on our already enormous na-
tional debt with poor financial plan-
ning, which I think this bill absolutely 
does. In fact, this bill simply shifts risk 
to Medicare recipients by adding bil-
lions in new costs to Medicare. 
I am not sure why the Democrats are 
so eager to threaten the viability of 
Medicare or the benefits for Medicare 
recipients. The Democrats triggered 
billions in Medicare funding cuts in 
2021 in Florida and other States in 
their wasteful, partisan COVID spend-
ing bill. Now they are putting even 
more stress on Medicare and the bene-
fits of Medicare recipients by shifting 
billions in new costs onto the program. 
According to the Congressional Budg-
et Office, between just 2025 and 2031, 
this bill would increase costs to Medi-
care by more than $1.9 billion for Part 
B and $4.2 billion for Part D. This will 
hurt Medicare recipients. And even 
that score is based on the limited num-
ber of future budget years that were 
covered in the CBO’s review. 
We must have a long-term CBO score 
on this bill so that Congress can clear-
ly review the future impacts to Medi-
care recipients. That is why I sent the 
director of the CBO a letter earlier 
today asking for more information 
about this bill. 
Over 60 million seniors across our 
country, including more than 4.5 mil-
lion seniors in Florida, rely on Medi-
care. It is unconscionable to add fur-
ther expenses to them and place the fu-
ture care of postal workers on the line 
when Medicare is already on the road 
to insolvency. 
The retiree health benefits for the 
Postal Service are partially unfunded. 
This bill provides no new funding for 
the retiree health benefits of postal 
workers. It doesn’t solve the problem. 
Now, I heard that my Democrat col-
leagues say this bill will address the 
massive supply chain crisis that mil-
lions of American families have suf-
fered from. I could not disagree with 
them more on this point. And, frankly, 
I am shocked that they are willing to 
unfairly stick our postal workers with 
the blame for the failures of the Biden 
administration that have created and 
worsened our supply chain problems. 
This bill does nothing to address this 
supply chain problem. 
I know that the hard-working men 
and women of the Postal Service are 
not the ones causing this crisis; but if 
my colleagues insist that they are, 
that is even more of a reason to make 
sure this bill is heard in committee so 
we can really dig into the problem and 
make sure we come with up a sustain-
able solution. 
There is no looming deadline that 
would necessitate rushed action by the 
Senate. This bill perfectly captures ev-
erything that is wrong with the way 
Washington solves problems. Instead of 
taking the time to craft a sustainable, 
affordable, and accountable solution 
that serves the interests of taxpayers, 
Medicare recipients, consumers, and 
postal workers and achieves our policy 
goals, Congress rushes bills into law so 
that politicians can send out a press re-
lease saying they did something, even 
if that something actually makes the 
problem worse. 
If any business operated like this, it 
would absolutely fail. We have to stop 
this insanity. Given the scope of the 
legislation, the potential negative im-
pact to postal workers, taxpayers, con-
sumers, Medicare recipients, and sen-
iors, the Senate should carefully and 
thoughtfully consider this bill. We 
should take all appropriate steps to 
make sure that we get this right. The 
Senate has simply not been afforded 
the opportunity to do that; therefore, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
what we heard is why people really are 
frustrated and angered at the U.S. Sen-
ate. This is a broad, bipartisan bill 
months and months in the making, 
with large amounts of discussion, has 
the support of the Democratic chair of 
the committee, the Republican chair of 
the committee, was voted in the House 
with a majority of Democrats and a 
majority of Republicans, and would fi-
nally fix the post office. 
I wonder if my colleague from Flor-
ida has ever heard his colleagues in 
Florida, his voters, talk about snail 
mail, about everything coming late— 
prescription drugs coming late, Social 
Security checks coming late, birthday 
cards arriving weeks after the birthday 
occurred. Finally, both parties come 
together in a bipartisan way in the 
House and Senate to pass this legisla-
tion, and the Senator from Florida is 
using a technical detail to hold us up. 
It is the same bill that was on the 
floor Thursday, where we had agree-
ment to move to vote on it tonight. 
But the House sent us a bill with a 
technical change. Five times in the 
past, this has happened; and each time, 
no Senator had the temerity to get up 
and block it on a technical issue. It 
just passed by UC, and we went and 
moved forward. 
Our constituents want us to fix the 
post office. An overwhelming majority 
of Democrats and Republicans want us 
to fix the post office. All the postal 
workers are for this bill. 
My colleague from Florida says he is 
defending postal workers. Ask the peo-
ple who represent them. I dare say, it 
is the head of the letter carriers and 
the head of the postal workers and the 
head of the mail handlers who rep-
resent the postal workers more than 
the Senator from Florida; and they are 
overwhelmingly for the bill, as is the 
Postmaster—an appointee of President 
Trump. 
So everyone tries to come together 
and get something done, and the ar-
cane rules of the Senate allow one per-
son to stand up—on a bill that has been 
out there and discussed repeatedly—at 
the last minute and raise objections. It 
is regrettable, and it is sad. 
There is good news, though. Even 
though this will delay the bill, we will 
pass it. We will have to just go through 
this elaborate process—the old-fash-
ioned and often discredited rules of the 
Senate that the Senator from Florida 
is employing—we will have to use 
them, but we will pass this bill because 
America needs it. Rural people need it. 
Senior citizens need it. Veterans need 
it—80 percent of veterans’ prescriptions 
are sent through the mail. Nobody 
should be standing in the way of this 
bill. It is a sad day that just one Mem-
ber has.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S665 
February 14, 2022 
I yield the floor to Senator PETERS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Thank you, Leader 
SCHUMER. 
Madam President, I stand in support 
of this bill. 
This bill is absolutely essential to 
make sure that the Postal Service is on 
sound financial footing. 
As 
Leader 
SCHUMER
mentioned, 
Americans all across our country rely 
on the Postal Service to deliver crit-
ical items to their home—things like 
medicines, which go via the Postal 
Service. They expect that service to 
provide it 6 days a week and to do it on 
time. But, unfortunately, the Postal 
Service has been saddled with rules 
that may make it very, very difficult. 
The legislation before us is an at-
tempt to fix those rules that make it 
more difficult for the Postal Service to 
deliver essential services and do it in a 
cost-effective way. 
It is something that has been dis-
cussed here in Congress for a decade or 
more—a decade or more. This is not an 
issue that just came out of nowhere. 
This is something we have been trying 
to fix for nearly a decade. 
Over the last year and a half, we have 
been working on bipartisan, bicameral 
legislation, bringing people together 
and saying, Let’s just focus on what is 
common sense. 
Now, let’s see, what is common 
sense? Right now, the Postal Service 
has 
had 
to 
prefund 
retirement 
healthcare for decades. No other com-
pany in America needs to do that. No 
other Federal agency in the govern-
ment does that. No one does it, but the 
Postal Service is saddled with this re-
quirement, which has billed tens of bil-
lions of dollars. It is common sense to 
treat the Postal Service like every 
other business and every other govern-
ment agency in the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Also, it makes sense to have retirees 
integrated into Medicare. Like every 
single company in America, it will be 
integrated into Medicare. And let’s be 
clear: Those postal workers have been 
paying into Medicare their whole work-
ing career. They are paying into Medi-
care. They should have the ability to 
actually get Medicare. 
This will also help the Postal Service 
be able to function in an efficient and 
effective way. 
The bipartisan, bicameral work that 
we did—I worked with my ranking 
member, Senator PORTMAN. We have 
been working with our counterparts in 
the House, and both the Democratic 
chair and the Republican ranking 
member came up with an agreement, 
got wide consensus from folks through-
out Congress. In fact, the bill that I in-
troduced here in the Senate, which is 
basically the bill that is before us from 
the House, has 28 cosponsors—14 Re-
publicans, 14 Democrats. How many 
bills do we have here on the floor that 
have that much support from both 
sides? 
This is bipartisan. This is common 
sense. It addresses a critical issue for 
the American people, and they want us 
to come together and solve it. But in-
stead, we have a procedural blocking 
technique to slow this down. And every 
day we wait, it puts the Postal Service 
in more jeopardy. It is time for action 
now. 
As the leader mentioned, since 2000, 
there have been similar kinds of mis-
takes by the transfer of a bill; five 
times—five times in 20 years. And 
every time, it has been settled quickly 
because people say it is just a mistake; 
let’s move on with the business of the 
people. Let’s not play games. I would 
hope we could do that now. 
Five times, it went quickly. In fact, 
three of those times, the bills that 
came over had less bipartisan support 
than this bill. This bill had 120 Repub-
licans support it in the House. 
It is time to move this forward. Let’s 
stop playing games. Let’s help the 
Postal Service. Let’s help the Amer-
ican people, and let’s show that the 
U.S. Senate knows how to get a job 
done. 
Mr. SCHUMER. And I dare say, the 
Senator from Michigan speaks for the 
vast majority of Members in this 
Chamber and in the House of either 
party. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate lay before the 
body a message from the House with 
respect to H.R. 3076 and that the Sen-
ate vote on the request without further 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object, I 
notice neither of my colleagues ad-
dressed the fact that, still, why didn’t 
this go to committee? Why wouldn’t we 
go through a process? This massive, 
billion-dollar bill, why wouldn’t we go 
to a committee? They did not address 
that. 
And, by the way, they talk about a 
technical error. I was here when my 
colleague from Florida had a technical 
change where the number was wrong, 
and my Democratic colleagues blocked 
the amendment. So this is not unheard 
of. 
On top of that, they never addressed 
the fact that this puts our Medicare re-
cipients and our Medicare Program at 
further risk because the program is not 
fully funded, and this is nothing to fix 
it. On top of that, with our retiree ben-
efits in the Postal Service, their fund-
ing is underfunded. This doesn’t do 
anything to improve their funding. 
So I am not going to object, but let’s 
make sure we clear up the facts here. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, the request is agreed to. 
MESSAGE

Senate the following message from the

ator from Washington. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT MCKINNON CALIFF 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor tonight to urge my 
colleagues to vote here in a minute to 
confirm Dr. Robert Califf to serve as 
Commissioner of the Food and Drug 
Administration. He was confirmed to 
this role previously with strong bipar-
tisan support. I hope to see that again 
this evening. 
At this critical moment, we need a 
trusted hand to lead the FDA, and Dr. 
Califf’s previous service in this role, 
his career as one of the Nation’s lead-
ing research scientists, give him the 
experience to take on this challenge. 
Families across the country count on 
the Food and Drug Administration 
every day to follow the science and the 
data to keep them safe, and COVID–19 
has put its work in the spotlight like 
never before. 
This pandemic has been incredibly 
hard on our Nation. It has killed over 
900,000 Americans. And throughout this 
crisis, as people have sought to keep 
their families safe, they have looked to 
the FDA and depended on the tireless 
work of FDA scientists to confirm the 
safety and effectiveness of treatments 
and vaccines, ensure we have high- 
quality masks, and review tests to 
make sure they give us accurate re-
sults and more. 
Parents across the country are con-
tinuing to wait anxiously for the FDA 
to greenlight safe, effective vaccines 
for kids under 5—something I know we 
all want to see as quickly as the 
science allows. 
But while the COVID–19 pandemic re-
mains one of the most urgent chal-
lenges we face, there are countless 
other ways the FDA works that mat-
ters to families. 
Every day, people put the well-being 
of themselves, their families, and even 
their pets in the FDA’s hands. When we 
sit down for a meal, we count on the 
FDA’s efforts to ensure the safety of 
our food supply and provide us with the 
information we need to make healthy 
choices. When we get our prescriptions 
filled or rely on medical devices to stay 
healthy, we count on the FDA’s work 
to uphold the gold standard of safety 
and effectiveness. 
The FDA needs strong leadership to 
continue that work and to address 
other pressing challenges: challenges 
like the opioid crisis, which recently 
claimed over 100,000 lives in a year— 
that is a new record; challenges like 
youth tobacco use—according to the 
CDC, 2 million of our youth use e-ciga-
rettes; challenges like antimicrobial

resistance, which could make common 
procedures more dangerous by making 
current infection treatments ineffec-
tive; challenges like skyrocketing drug 
costs and pharmaceutical companies 
who game the FDA approval system to 
keep more affordable drugs off the 
market; and challenges like improving 
health equity. 
I have repeatedly raised the need for 
the FDA to improve diversity in clin-
ical trials because, when women or peo-
ple of color or others are left out of the 
clinical trials, this undermines people’s 
health by delaying information they 
and their healthcare providers need to 
understand how a treatment will affect 
them specifically—for example, wheth-
er it is safe during pregnancy—and by 
making it hard to identify differences 
in the safety and effectiveness of treat-
ments for those populations. 
As the hard-working staff at the FDA 
continues to tackle these challenges, 
they deserve a Senate-confirmed leader 
with experience on these issues to lead 
those efforts. Dr. Califf worked on 
these challenges before, when he was 
previously confirmed to lead FDA in an 
overwhelming bipartisan vote, and he 
demonstrated in his hearing with the 
HELP Committee that he is ready to 
take them on again and return as Com-
missioner. 
So I urge all of my colleagues to join 
me in voting to confirm Dr. Califf and 
working with him to ensure that the 
FDA continues to protect our families, 
uphold the gold standard of safety and 
effectiveness, and put science and data 
first. 
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture 
having been invoked, the Senate will 
now proceed to executive session and 
resume consideration of the following 
nomination, which the clerk will re-
port. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
Robert McKinnon Califf, of North Caro-
lina, to be Commissioner of Food and 
Drugs, 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human Services. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. I would ask consent to 
speak as if in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this 
evening to talk about Black History 
Month and, in particular, to talk about 
a program that my office has been pre-
senting every February for many years 
now. 
Each February, it has been my privi-
lege to honor several Pennsylvanians 
as part of the celebration of Black His-
tory Month. This year, we pay tribute 
to four esteemed Pennsylvanians who 
have helped their community and the 
Commonwealth build resilience. 
And I will list them first, and then I 
will be talking about each of them in 
greater detail: First, Tyrone Holmes, 
from my hometown of Scranton, PA; 
Della Clark of Philadelphia, PA; Julius 
Boatwright of Pittsburgh; and Theo 
Braddy of Harrisburg—all Pennsylva-
nians. And their work is demonstrative 
of this year’s theme for our program: 
‘‘Resilience in the Face of Adversity.’’ 
As their persistence and strength has 
helped their communities surmount 
significant difficulties this year, their 
enduring leadership is an encourage-
ment to me after a year where, sadly, 
resilience 
has 
been 
sorely 
needed 
throughout our Commonwealth and 
throughout our country. 
Now, in some ways, we have made 
some progress in the last year. Just 
consider this: The national economy 
created 6.7 million jobs, the most ever 
in the first year of a Presidency. Penn-
sylvania’s unemployment rate went 
way down from 7.1 to 5.4. Tens of thou-
sands of jobs have been added just in 
Pennsylvania. Wages are up, and child 
poverty is down. The number of fully 
vaccinated Americans has increased 
from 2 million to 213 million in just the 
last year. And we have more tools to 
manage COVID–19 and keep us safe. 
And, finally, the number of schools 
open for in-person learning has sky-
rocketed from just 46 percent a year 
ago to now 95 percent of schools. Some 
believe it is as high as 98 percent. 
However, despite those measures of 
progress, we are still grappling with so 
much—grappling with a virus that is 
adaptable and still deadly, especially 
for people with preexisting health con-
ditions, and even more so for those who 
are unvaccinated. 
And as COVID–19 has lingered, so, 
too, have the attendant direct effects. 
Our schools still struggle to teach our 
kids and to maintain the regularity 
that is critical to learning. 
Our businesses must contend with 
fluctuating demand and a fragile sup-
ply chain. Many of our children have 
fallen behind on their other critical 
vaccinations and routine doctor visits. 
Many children and adults struggle with 
isolation and pandemic-related mental 
health challenges. 
We know that much of the adverse 
impact of COVID–19 has been particu-
larly acute for communities of color. In 
the United States, Black Americans 
have 
experienced 
higher 
rates 
of 
COVID–19 hospitalization and death 
compared to White Americans. And

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S667 
February 14, 2022 
Black Americans have had higher lev-
els of COVID–19-related unemployment. 
Beyond the pandemic, other chal-
lenges remain. Systemic racism per-
sists in our economy, in our schools, in 
our healthcare system, and, of course, 
in our criminal justice system, just to 
mention a few. And even as we strive 
as a nation to achieve our high ideals 
of liberty and freedom for all, we must 
openly acknowledge a history of dis-
crimination and racism and reckon 
with its present-day manifestations 
and implications, including disturbing 
efforts around the country to turn 
back the clock on voting rights. 
It is only the challenges brought 
about by adversity that occasion the 
rise of resiliency and the triumphs of 
the human spirit and of community ac-
tion that can lift all of us. 
The late Member of Congress, Shirley 
Chisholm, once said: 
Leadership is to have the vision for what is 
necessary and the courage to make it pos-
sible. 
Leadership is to have the vision for 
what is necessary and the courage to 
make it possible. 
Following a year of difficult chal-
lenges, it is fitting that as part of our 
Black History Month celebration, we 
honor innovative, courageous, and en-
terprising Pennsylvania leaders who 
have both the vision and the courage to 
help our communities and our Com-
monwealth to exhibit resilience in the 
face of that adversity. 
TRIBUTE TO TY HOLMES 
Mr. President, let me start with Ty 
Holmes, our first honoree. I am proud 
to honor Ty as a fellow resident of 
Scranton, and the President of the 
Lackawanna branch of the NAACP. Ty 
Holmes is well known in Scranton as 
an avid volunteer and advocate for di-
versity and inclusion through his work 
with multiple community organiza-
tions, including as a Penn State advi-
sory board member, the vice president 
of the Scranton Rotary, and as a 
Lackawanna County Democratic Com-
mittee member. 
Following the death of George Floyd 
in 2020, community members were in-
spired to make change in Northeastern 
Pennsylvania and establish the Lacka-
wanna County NAACP. Since its found-
ing in 2020, this NAACP branch has 
grown to 131 members. Under Ty 
Holmes’ leadership, the branch is work-
ing to be a voice for underrepresented 
groups and serve as a bridge between 
them and the broader community in 
Scranton. 
Ty also has a particular interest in 
bettering the lives of young people in 
Scranton, leading him to run for the 
Scranton School Board. This past No-
vember, he was elected to the board 
and sworn in last month. With his elec-
tion, Ty Holmes becomes the first Afri-
can American to ever be elected to pub-
lic office in the city of Scranton. He 
also serves as a board member for the 
Northeastern 
Pennsylvania 
Youth 
Shelter, which provides quality emer-
gency shelter and related services to 
unaccompanied youth, ages 14 through 
their high school graduation. 
The 
Northeastern 
Pennsylvania 
Youth Shelter has a specific focus on 
social justice and advocacy and is wel-
coming to young people from all back-
grounds, especially LGBTQ+ youth in 
the area. 
Ty Holmes’ life has been one of serv-
ice, both to his community and to his 
country. He retired after 25 years of 
Active Duty in the U.S. military, 
where he received numerous decora-
tions from both the U.S. Navy and the 
U.S. Army. He began his military ca-
reer in 1991 with the Navy and served in 
various duty stations throughout the 
South Pacific and the Middle East. 
In 2003, he crossed branches and en-
tered the U.S. Army, deploying in the 
Middle East. He also worked as part of 
the support and rescue operations in 
New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina 
in 2005. 
Through his work with many com-
munity organizations and his role on 
the Scranton School District Board of 
Directors, Ty continues to build the 
Scranton institutions that provide sup-
port to people and those institutions 
that lift them up during times of ad-
versity. 
So I look forward to seeing Ty 
Holmes’ continuing contributions to 
my hometown for years to come. 
TRIBUTE TO DELLA CLARK 
Mr. President, our second honoree is 
Della Clark from Philadelphia, PA. 
Della Clark is a true community shep-
herd. I am not the first to recognize 
Della’s exemplary work, and I cer-
tainly won’t be the last, but I am hon-
ored to add my voice to her chorus of 
admirers. Her work in the city of 
Philadelphia, 
particularly 
in 
West 
Philadelphia, has undoubtedly been a 
saving grace 100 times over. 
Della is indefatigable, a true force of 
nature who has shown true dedication 
and steadfast leadership. 
Since January 1, 1992, Della Clark 
has served as president of the Enter-
prise Center. This center supports mi-
nority 
entrepreneurs 
and 
underresourced communities and is one 
of the most trusted organizations in 
the region to advise and deliver trans-
formative economic development and 
community wealth-building initiatives. 
Under Della’s leadership, the Enter-
prise Center has experienced tremen-
dous growth. Among its accomplish-
ments is its purchase of a dilapidated 
building at 46th and Market Street in 
West Philadelphia, which was com-
pletely renovated and now serves as 
the center’s state-of-the-art center for 
business and entrepreneurship. 
Additionally, affiliate organizations 
have been added to the center’s port-
folio, including the Enterprise Center 
Community Development Corporation 
and the Enterprise Center Capital Cor-
poration. Today, the Enterprise Center 
is leading a project that will be trans-
formative for the city of Philadelphia— 
the 52nd Street Initiative. 
This commercial corridor along 52nd 
Street in West Philadelphia has been 
an important historical and cultural 
hub, but unfortunately has seen signifi-
cant decline and recent disinvestment 
just over the last number of years. 
Further exacerbating the already ex-
isting troubles for business owners and 
residents, the COVID–19 pandemic and 
civil unrest have made recovery and re-
vitalization challenging at best. The 
Enterprise Center has a bold vision for 
this 52nd Street Initiative, which will 
transform this street—52nd Street— 
into a national model for integrating 
technology to improve public safety, 
enhance visitor experience, and support 
businesses and residents. 
With Della Clark at the helm, I am 
confident she will move mountains to 
see to it that this project reaches its 
full potential and that this vital neigh-
borhood and its residents can thrive 
once again. 
Della Clark speaks eloquently—yet 
fiercely—on the importance of invest-
ing in Black and Brown businesses and 
is a tireless advocate for equitable dis-
tribution of and access to resources 
and capital. For that, I thank her for 
being a champion, a leader, and a true 
servant for her community. 
TRIBUTE TO JULIUS BOATWRIGHT 
Mr. 
President, 
in 
Southwestern 
Pennsylvania, our third honoree is Ju-
lius Boatwright. Not only has the pan-
demic taken a toll on the Nation’s 
physical health, but many Americans 
struggle with mental health chal-
lenges, particularly isolation and grief. 
Julius Boatwright knows that good 
mental 
health 
is 
fundamental, 
foundational, to overall well-being. 
He has made delivering critical men-
tal health services his life’s work. At a 
time when the pandemic has left many 
Americans feeling isolated, alone, and 
depressed, Julius’s mission has renewed 
urgency. 
In his work as a licensed social work-
er, community-based therapist, and 
outpatient 
therapist, 
Julius 
Boatwright has led with profound vul-
nerability and understanding. His pas-
sion for mental health is derived from 
a deeply personal place. Julius has 
bravely 
discussed 
his 
own 
mental 
health struggles in an effort to open up 
a conversation about mental well- 
being. His experience of growing up in 
a household and a community where 
mental health was never talked about 
planted the desire for him to address 
silent suffering. 
In college, the death of a friend by 
suicide could have disrupted Julius’s 
journey to becoming a mental health 
professional. Instead, this deeply per-
sonal challenge spurred him onward. 
He would go on to earn a bachelor’s de-
gree in communications and a master’s 
of social work, with a certificate in 
human services management, from the 
University of Pittsburgh, as well as es-
tablish the Pittsburgh-based nonprofit 
Steel Smiling. 
Julius is now the founding and man-
aging director of Steel Smiling. The or-
ganization’s mission is to bridge the 
gap between Black people and mental

health support through education, ad-
vocacy, and awareness. Steel Smiling 
has an ambitious goal, to connect 
every Black person in Pittsburgh to a 
positive mental health experience that 
improves their quality of life by the 
year 2030. 
Julius’s empathy and vision is en-
couraging and inspiring, and I look for-
ward to witnessing the transformative 
impact of his work. Steel Smiling has 
already begun to improve the mental 
well-being of Pittsburgh’s Black com-
munity. Since 2019, the organization 
has been a significant provider of com-
munity 
services, 
helping 
Black 
Pittsburghers to receive mental health 
treatment, training, and support. 
The implementation of culturally 
sensitive 
programs, 
trainings, 
and 
workshops have helped combat the cul-
tural stigma that exists in Black and 
Brown communities surrounding men-
tal health. 
The need for sensitive, stigma-free 
mental health support has been a long-
standing one, but there has been a long 
gap between the need for services and 
the availability of them. 
Furthermore, 
the 
COVID–19 
pan-
demic has even more starkly illus-
trated the critical need for behavioral 
health services, especially for people of 
color. So I am grateful to Julius for 
not just recognizing the need but for 
stepping up and working to address 
critical community need. 
(Ms. SMITH assumed the chair.) 
TRIBUTE TO THEO BRADDY 
Madam 
President, 
finally, 
Theo 
Braddy, our fourth honoree. 
Theo is from Harrisburg, PA, and he 
is the personification of resilience in 
the face of adversity, and I am honored 
to recognize him today. 
At the age of 15, Theo was involved in 
an accident while playing high school 
football, and the resulting neck injury 
left him paralyzed and a wheelchair 
user. 
This 
life-changing 
experience 
would become a catalyst for his future 
work in the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania. 
After his accident, Theo moved to 
Pennsylvania 
and 
completed 
high 
school. He furthered his education by 
graduating from Edinboro University 
in Erie County, and then he earned his 
master’s degree in social work from 
Temple University in 1988. 
Later that year, Theo Braddy estab-
lished and became the founding direc-
tor of the Center for Independent Liv-
ing of Central Pennsylvania, a position 
he held for over 30 years. As CEO, Theo 
was instrumental in creating an inde-
pendent living center that would be-
come a strong and vibrant voice for 
people with disabilities in central 
Pennsylvania and, indeed, throughout 
the Commonwealth. 
Under Theo’s leadership, the Center 
for 
Independent 
Living 
of 
Central 
Pennsylvania not only provided essen-
tial services for people with disabilities 
but has also advocated for accessible 
transportation, more access to assist-
ive technology, and expanded home- 
and community-based services. 
Theo crafted his leadership role to 
both create services for people with 
disabilities and to advocate to improve 
the lives of people with disabilities. 
In addition to his work leading the 
center, Theo has served on numerous 
boards and committees over his career, 
influencing disability policy. 
He was appointed by three different 
Governors of Pennsylvania to serve as 
a commissioner for the Pennsylvania 
Human Relations Commission. Theo 
also served on the Pennsylvania State-
wide Independent Living Council. 
He has taken his years of service and 
advocacy to the classroom to help 
shape the disability leaders of the fu-
ture, teaching at several institutions of 
higher education. For example, in 2019, 
after leading the Center for Inde-
pendent Living of Central Pennsyl-
vania for those 30 years, Theo retired 
to begin his next venture. Today, Theo 
serves as president of his own con-
sulting firm. 
I have had the opportunity to work 
with Theo on a number of disability 
issues over the years, and his profes-
sional and personal knowledge about 
the importance of home- and commu-
nity-based services has been invaluable 
in shaping meaningful policy and com-
municating it to Members of Congress. 
For over 40 years, Theo has proudly 
and inclusively served the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania with his advo-
cacy for people with disabilities. We 
are grateful for his commitment to 
making our State and our Nation fairer 
and more accessible for all. 
In conclusion, it is a privilege and a 
pleasure to be able to honor these re-
markable Pennsylvanians: Ty Holmes, 
Della Clark, Julius Boatwright, and 
Theo Braddy. While their work as re-
pairers of the breach varies from com-
munity activism and youth develop-
ment to economic development, to 
mental health support, to the civil 
rights of people with disabilities, all 
four share a commitment to lifting up 
their neighbors and their neighbor-
hoods. They believe that we are strong-
er when we stand together and that, by 
joining hands with our brothers and 
sisters, we can overcome adversity, 
build resilience, and flourish together. 
As we head toward the light at the 
end of the tunnel of this pandemic and

ator from Ohio. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor tonight with my col-
league from New Hampshire, Senator 
JEANNE SHAHEEN, to discuss the crit-
ical situation in Ukraine. 
Ukraine is an independent country. 
It is a democracy. It is an ally of ours. 
It is a country that is currently under 
siege. There is a threat of invasion by 
Russia that grows every single day. 
Right now, there are more than 
130,000 Russian troops under the com-
mand 
of 
100 
tactical 
groups 
sur-
rounding Ukraine. This Russian de-
ployment 
includes 
nuclear-capable 
missiles, rockets, tanks, and artillery, 
and it is no longer just on the eastern 
border of Ukraine, where there has 
been activity before, as we will discuss, 
but now on the northern border, where 
Russian 
combat 
troops 
and 
heavy 
equipment have moved into the coun-
try of Belarus and also in Crimea. Ad-
ditionally, Russia has now deployed 
amphibious assault ships and other 
ships into the Black Sea, to the south, 
and has positioned its S–400 missile de-
fense systems, which could stop flights 
into Ukraine. 
So from the east, from the north, and 
from the south, Ukraine is facing this 
threat. News accounts say additional 
equipment is actually being moved to 
the Ukrainian border, not being pulled 
away. 
While there are differing views on 
whether Russia has made the final de-
cision as to whether to invade or not, 
there is no question that they have 
now amassed the capability needed to 
conduct 
a 
full-scale 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. 
Let’s not forget that Russia has in-
vaded Ukraine twice in the past 8 
years, illegally annexing Crimea and 
inserting troops and offensive military 
equipment into the Donbas region in 
the east. 
They have also targeted cyber at-
tacks against public and private enti-
ties in Ukraine and continue to use in-
formation to try to destabilize the 
democratically elected Government of 
Ukraine. 
By the way, Ukrainians have lost 
about 14,000 citizens in the last 5 years 
at the hands of the Russians—14,000— 
fathers, brothers. That would be, as a 
percentage of our population, like the 
United States losing about 115,000 peo-
ple. That is more than we lost in Viet-
nam and Korea combined—actually, 
Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan 
combined. Think how we would feel. 
And let’s not forget that Russia con-
tinues, day by day, to conduct this low- 
grade but serious war against Ukraine. 
We all hope that instead of an inva-
sion, Russia chooses a diplomatic end 
to this current crisis, but we had better 
treat this threat of an invasion as a 
very real and serious possibility. Doing 
anything else would be irresponsible, 
given the massive mobilization and the 
past malign behavior. 
And 
all 
freedom-loving 
countries 
have an interest here. Ukraine is where 
the cause of freedom is under siege 
today in our generation. 
Eight years ago, Ukrainians made a 
very deliberate choice. They stood up 
to a corrupt Russian-backed govern-
ment, and they turned to the West, to 
the European Union, to America. They 
said that they wanted to be like us. 
I was in Ukraine in 2014 shortly after 
what is called the ‘‘Euromaidan,’’ the 
revolution of dignity. The barricades

were still there in the center of town. 
The Maidan is a square that was still 
occupied by Ukrainian patriots. They 
sat there in makeshift tents in the cold 
because they believed that their hard- 
won freedom was worth defending. 
And they did defend it. In the pro-
tests against the Russian-backed gov-
ernment, they lost 100 Ukrainian citi-
zens by the security forces of the Rus-
sian-backed government. These indi-
viduals were called the ‘‘Heavenly Hun-
dred,’’ and they are still honored today 
by memorials at the Maidan. Their 
freedom came at a high price, and they 
were willing to defend it then, as they 
are today. 
I was there as an election observer 
with other American and European of-
ficials, mostly parliamentarians from 
Europe, and we witnessed a fair and ro-
bust Presidential election with a huge 
turnout. I saw their patriotism and na-
tional pride. 
The Ukrainian people are proud and 
consider themselves Ukrainian, not 
Russian. They have been a free and 
independent country for 30 years, and 
since the protests in 2014, they have 
been on a track toward a Western-fo-
cused democracy and a free-market 
economy. It is their choice to be free 
and independent, and no country—no 
country—has the right to take that 
away from them. 
I also want to highlight a change 
since 2014, and that is in the pro-
ficiency of the Ukrainian military and 
the great tragedy that would result 
from an illegal invasion of Ukraine. 
The Ukrainian military will stand up, 
and they are ready. The military of 
today is a professional force that has 
been fighting this low-grade war with 
Russia for the past 8 years. It is not the 
military they had in 2014. They are, in-
stead, battle hardened today. And 
thanks to the United States and our al-
lies, including many NATO allies, they 
are better trained and better equipped 
than ever before. 
I have been to the line of contact in 
the Donbas region—the line of contact, 
which is where the Russian troops are 
on one side and the Ukrainian troops 
are on the other, firing back and forth 
periodically. I have seen these troops 
from Ukraine. They are tough. They 
know how to fight, and they will fight 
to defend their country. 
And Ukraine is a big country. It is a 
nation of 418 million people. In the cap-
ital city of Kyiv, there are almost 3 
million people. Think about the hu-
manitarian disaster that will ensue if 
there is an invasion—millions of inno-
cent civilians displaced from their 
homes in the dead of a Ukrainian win-
ter, fleeing desperately for safety, 
while fighting rages around them. This 
is not a sight anybody wants to see. 
By the way, the blood of these inno-
cents will be on the hands of the Rus-
sians. 
And there will be significant Russian 
casualties as well, and severe multilat-
eral sanctions that will be devastating 
for the Russian economy and targeted 
sanctions that will ensure that the era 
of Russian oligarchs treating the West 
as their playground while pillaging 
their own country of resources and 
wealth will be no more. 
In 2014, the Ukrainian people rejected 
authoritarianism and chose instead de-
mocracy, freedom of speech, freedom to 
gather, respect for the rule of law, free 
markets, prosperity. They are not 
going back. 
Despite Russia’s underlying efforts to 
destabilize Ukraine over the past 8 
years, the people of Ukraine remain 
committed to this independent, sov-
ereign, and democratic nation. They 
don’t want State control, repression, 
and fear. They instead seek liberty and 
opportunity. 
Moscow would have the world believe 
that somehow this massive, unwar-
ranted Russian buildup is about trying 
to shore up its border against threats 
from Ukraine and NATO. This is, of 
course, patently false and should be re-
jected out of hand by America and its 
many allies. Ukraine’s military pos-
ture has always been defensive. They 
just want to be left alone. And unlike 
Russia, Ukraine has upheld its commit-
ments under the Minsk agreements, 
which 
were 
designed 
to 
ensure 
a 
ceasefire in the Donbas region. NATO 
is defensive and is no threat to Russian 
territorial integrity. 
It is important to note that Ukraine 
is not asking for us to fight this war 
for them. They are asking us for in-
creased lethal military assistance to 
help them defend themselves should 
Russia make a mistake and invade 
Ukraine again. And they are asking all 
of us to abide by commitments we have 
made. In 1994, after the Berlin Wall 
came down, Ukraine signed what is 
called the Budapest Memorandum. It 
was a treaty where Ukraine agreed to 
give up its nuclear weapons in ex-
change for security guarantees from 
Russia, the United States, and the 
United Kingdom; that we would all re-
spect the independence and sovereignty 
of Ukraine and refrain from the threat 
or the use of force against Ukraine. 
These are commitments that must be 
honored. 
I know there is a lot that our country 
and this Congress are divided over 
today, and we see it played out on the 
floor and in the media constantly. But 
I will tell you, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike are united in backing 
Ukraine in this crisis. That is why it is 
so important that my colleague from 
New Hampshire is on the floor with me 
today. She has been a stalwart. We 
traveled to Ukraine 2 weeks ago and 
had the opportunity to meet with the 
leading officials there, including Presi-
dent Zelenskyy, but also talked to the 
Ukrainian people. And we let them 
know that on a bipartisan basis we sup-
port Ukraine. We have a bipartisan 
consensus on the broad structure of 
sanctions and an aid package for 
Ukraine. 
The sanctions, by the way, would 
cripple the Russian economy. We have 
some 
disagreement 
perhaps 
over 
preinvasion or postinvasion sanctions 
and how much on each, but we agree on 
sanctions. 
We also agree on assisting Ukraine 
with further and much needed support: 
defense against cyber attacks, as an ex-
ample, that the Russians are already 
conducting—and we expect more to 
come—and 
disinformation 
attacks 
coming from Russia. We agree, Repub-
licans and Democrats alike, not just on 
sanctions but providing more support 
to Ukraine for these critical areas. And 
of course we agreed on providing more 
military assistance to Ukraine so they 
can defend themselves. 
We have come to a consensus on 
these issues. What we now need is for 
all of us to work together, including 
the White House, to ensure that we can 
step forward and put legislation or a 
resolution on the floor to ensure that 
we are doing whatever we possibly can 
to make it clear what the consequences 
will be to act as a deterrent to Russia 
from making a terrible mistake. 
This is a critical time for us to act 
and to lead. It is time for us and the 
Congress and for this government to 
speak with one voice. Freedom in East-
ern Europe depends on it but so does 
the cause of freedom all around the 
world. 
I now yield to my colleague from 
New Hampshire Senator SHAHEEN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
couldn’t agree more with the com-
ments 
of 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
PORTMAN from Ohio. 
We are here on the floor today to 
convey strong bipartisan opposition 
that exists in this Senate to Vladimir 
Putin’s unprovoked aggression against 
our partner Ukraine. 
Now, like everyone in this body, I 
have been closely following the dete-
riorating political crisis that has been 
fabricated by Russia because, as Sen-
ator PORTMAN says, Ukraine has al-
ways been defensive. It has not been of-
fensive going against Russia, but Rus-
sia intends to further undermine and 
threaten Ukraine’s sovereignty. 
This Senate has a long history of 
supporting an independent and demo-
cratic Ukraine. Since Russia’s initial 
invasion in 2014, Congress has provided 
more than $2.7 billion in security as-
sistance and supported its government 
in advancing critical reforms to help 
Ukraine on its journey to greater Euro- 
Atlantic integration. 
I am proud to have been involved in 
a number of those bipartisan efforts to 
support Ukraine. As Senator PORTMAN 
said, last month, we traveled with a bi-
partisan delegation of seven Senators— 
four 
Democrats 
and 
three 
Repub-
licans—to meet with Ukrainian Presi-
dent Zelenskyy and other officials. We 
met with his national security team to 
discuss the Russian threat and how the 
United States can help our Ukrainian 
friends. 
The message from the Ukrainians 
was clear. They see their future in

February 14, 2022 
partnership with the West. They share 
our democratic values, and their people 
are proud of their hard-won independ-
ence. 
So it is worth asking, if Ukraine has 
made its sovereign wish clear that it 
wants a future with Europe, why does 
Putin have more than 130,000 troops at 
its border? 
As Senator PORTMAN pointed out so 
well, it is not just its eastern border 
with Russia; it is its northern border 
with Belarus. So it has been said—but 
I think it is worth repeating—that this 
unprecedented 
Russian 
threat 
to 
Ukraine’s sovereignty is on Putin. It is 
on no one else. He has designed this 
crisis to advance his own revanchist 
agenda. He wants to reconstruct the 
Soviet Union and recreate his own 
sphere of interest, and he wrongfully 
sees Ukraine as part of this authori-
tarian future. 
But make no mistake, this isn’t just 
about Ukraine. Putin wants to dimin-
ish U.S. presence in Europe and to re-
write the European security order for 
his benefit and in blatant disregard for 
previous international agreements and 
treaties that Russia has signed. Sen-
ator PORTMAN talked about the Buda-
pest Memorandum. There have been 
other efforts to try and reduce tensions 
between Russia and Ukraine by Eu-
rope, but Putin has basically thumbed 
his nose at all of those efforts. He has 
shown repeated attempts to subvert 
democratic institutions in the United 
States, to attack our infrastructure, 
and to compromise the sovereignty of 
our allies around the globe. 
This is why what happens in Ukraine 
matters here in the United States. It is 
important that we stand up for our val-
ues; it is important that we stand up to 
protect our national security; and it is 
critical that we continue to uphold and 
protect 
the 
transatlantic 
security 
order that has given us peace and pros-
perity for over 70 years, since the end 
of World War II. 
As Putin tries to dismantle and di-
vide the very alliance that has kept us 
safe for more than 70 years, it is all the 
more important that we strengthen our 
resolve through a strong message of 
unbreakable unity. 
It is critical that the Senate take up 
and pass bipartisan legislation that 
shows our support for Ukraine and our 
opposition to Russia and what Putin is 
doing. I have been working toward this 
goal. I especially want to commend 
Senator PORTMAN
for his work and 
leadership because he has also been 
working toward this goal. The Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee chair-
man and ranking member, Senators 
MENENDEZ and RISCH, continue their ef-
forts to find a bipartisan path forward. 
And I am sure Senator PORTMAN would 
agree with me that when we say we are 
committed to doing our part to forge a 
path forward on this legislation, we 
mean that is what we want to do; that 
this is an opportunity for us to show 
the rest of the world that we are 
united. 
That is why we are here today, to 
send a strong bipartisan message to 
Putin, to Ukraine, and to our allies. We 
must lead by example and convey, as 
we have done through our Ukrainian 
partners and our transatlantic allies, 
that we must not leave any space for 
Putin to sow further discord. 
Therefore, the Senate doesn’t really 
have a choice; we must send a message 
of strong, unequivocal bipartisan re-
solve. 
For 
many 
years, 
Senator 
PORTMAN
and I and others in the 
Ukraine Caucus have worked closely to 
support the Ukrainian people. We trav-
eled to Kyiv to ensure the U.S. resolve 
for our Ukrainian partners was abso-
lute. We teamed up to increase mili-
tary assistance to Ukraine, and we 
have spoken to ensure, on the topic of 
Ukraine, that this Senate speaks with 
one bipartisan voice. 
So today we stand united here on the 
floor of the Senate to send an un-
equivocal message to Putin: You will 
not divide the Senate; you will not di-
vide the United States; and you will 
not divide the transatlantic alliance. 
Diplomacy remains an option, I hope, 
to deescalate this situation and to pur-
sue a peaceful resolution, but if Putin 
decides to further invade Ukraine, he 
will only succeed in uniting us all— 
Democrats, Republicans, Americans, 
and the transatlantic alliance—in send-
ing a message of unmistakable resolve 
against his belligerence. I hope he 
chooses peace rather than war, but we 
plan to be ready. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I would like to com-
mend my colleague from New Hamp-
shire for her strong statement. There 
should be no mistake here. The United 
States of America is united, as this 
place is united, the Senate and the 
House, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
alike, in standing with Ukraine. 
And if there were to be another inva-
sion, the consequences would be dev-
astating for Russia. It would also, by 
the way, be harmful to the stability of 
Europe and the cause of freedom all 
around the world because then you 
would have an authoritarian country 
coming into a democratically elected 
smaller country and invading it, as 
Russia has already done in Crimea and 
parts of Donbas. 
So this effort tonight on the floor is 
simply to make it very clear that re-
gardless of what legislative vehicle we 
end up choosing or resolution or other, 
there is no question that we are united, 
both Republicans and Democrats, in 
doing what is nonpartisan, which is 
standing up for freedom, which is what 
America has traditionally done. 
I thank my colleague. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Would my colleague 
yield for a question? 
Mr. PORTMAN. Absolutely. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Because as he points 
out, if Putin does invade Ukraine, as he 
said, it would be devastating for 
Ukraine, for those of us who believe in 
freedom, and the right of each indi-
vidual country to determine their own 
future; but this would also be the big-
gest conflict in Europe since World 
War II; is that correct? 
Mr. PORTMAN. That is correct. And 
if there is an invasion, it would be the 
first time since 1945 that we have seen 
this kind of malign behavior—not just 
an invasion but even the proof we have 
seen of the so-called hybrid attacks, 
the cyber attacks, the disinformation 
attacks, which is why so many in Eu-
rope are alarmed, particularly in the 
Baltics and Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia 
and Poland, Romania. Countries that 
are right on the border, they realize 
that this is not going to end in Ukraine 
if this is what happens. It will send a 
message that we no longer have this 
post-World War II security system in 
place in Europe that has kept the 
peace. 
So my hope is that we will continue 
to see not just unity here on the floor 
of the Senate and in the House and in 
the White House to stand up for 
Ukraine but among our allies because 
all of us are engaged in this. 
And I must say I think what Russia 
and Vladimir Putin have done quite 
well in the last several weeks is unify 
the transatlantic alliance in ways I 
have rarely seen it. So NATO is strong-
er than ever because the Secretary 
General of NATO talked about this. He 
sounds exactly like we do, meaning 
that this shall not stand and cannot 
happen. So I think this is going to 
bring us together. 
But deterrence is what we are all 
about—a peaceful resolution, a backing 
off, and the ability to allow a free and 
independent people of Ukraine to have 
their sovereignty and territorial integ-
rity respected. 
Now, may I ask my colleague from 
New Hampshire a question? 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Absolutely. 
Mr. PORTMAN. We have seen here on 
the floor of the Senate lots of back- 
and-forth and partisanship. I made the 
assertion earlier that I see colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle being unified 
on this. I certainly feel that way with 
my Republican colleagues. Can the 
Senator speak to it as to her Demo-
cratic colleagues? 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Certainly, the Pre-
siding Officer would agree with me that 
in the Democratic caucus we are also 
united with the Republican caucus in 
wanting to support Ukraine to ensure 
that they can determine their own fu-
ture and to hold Vladimir Putin ac-
countable. 
As you say, hopefully, diplomacy will 
win out, and there will be some way in 
which we can work with Vladimir 
Putin to address some of his concerns. 
We are certainly not going to allow 
Putin 
and 
Russia 
to 
determine 
Ukraine’s future—to say to Ukraine 
‘‘You can’t join NATO’’ or to say to 
Europe and NATO ‘‘You can’t expand 
into Europe if countries want to join.’’ 
Hopefully, he will choose a path that is

going to be good not just for Europe 
and the United States and Ukraine but 
for Russia, because, as the German 
Chancellor said to us last week when 
he met with a number of Senators: In 
the long run, this will not be good for 
Russia—for its energy future—because 
Europe is going to get off Russian en-
ergy a lot faster if Russia invades 
Ukraine, and it is not going to be good 
for Russia’s standing either in Europe 
or in the world. 
So, hopefully, Putin will choose the 
reasonable approach, which is that he 
will choose diplomacy and not choose 
war. 
It is our job—that of the trans-
atlantic alliance and those of us here 
in Congress—to hold Putin accountable 
if he makes the wrong choice, to make 
sure that we put in place crippling 
sanctions, that we provide the assist-
ance that Ukraine needs in fighting 
Russia, and that we make it clear to 
the world that the world order that we 
have defended for the last 70 years we 
are going to continue to defend.

Systems 
(GMLRS) 
Alternate 
Warhead 
(AW) Unitary Rocket Pods 
The Government of Jordan has requested 
to buy one hundred fourteen (114) Guided 
Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) 
Unitary High Explosive (HE) Tri-Mode Fuze 
(GMLRS–U) (M31) Rockets; and one hundred 
fourteen (114) Reduced Range Practice Rock-
ets (RRPR). Also included is support equip-
ment; publications and technical data; per-
sonnel training and equipment; systems inte-
gration support; U.S. Government and con-
tractor engineering technical and logistics 
support services; and other related elements 
of logistics and program support. The esti-
mated total cost is $70 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security ofthe United 
States by helping to improve the security 
ofa Major Non-NATO Ally that is an impor-
tant force for political stability and eco-
nomic progress in the Middle East. 
The proposed sale will improve Jordan’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats on its borders and provide greater se-
curity for its economic infrastructure. This 
sale will provide Jordan with a long-range 
precision artillery support capability that 
will significantly improve U.S.-Jordan inter-
operability and provide for the defense of 
vital installations. Jordan will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing these additional systems 
into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale ofthis equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Missile and Fire Control, Dallas, TX. 
There are no known offset agreements pro-
posed in connection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this sale will not re-
quire the assignment of any additional U.S. 
Government or contractor representatives to 
Jordan. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result ofthis proposed 
sale.

Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Guided Multiple Launch Rocket 
System (GMLRS) is a solid propellant artil-
lery rocket for the High Mobility Artillery 
Rocket System (HIMARS). GMLRS uses 
GPS-aided inertial guidance to accurately 
and quickly deliver a single high-explosive 
blast fragmentation warhead to targets. The 
GMLRS has an operational range of 15–70km. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
Government of Jordan can provide substan-
tially the same degree of protection for the 
sensitive technology being released as the 
U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in 
furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Jor-
dan.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO TAMI ROSSILLON 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
wish to honor a brave citizen of To-
peka, KS, Tami Rossillon. This brave 
woman put herself in the face of danger 
to rescue not only a drowning dog, but 
the dog’s owner as well. 
In late January, Tami was taking a 
quick work call in her car near Lake 
Shawnee, when she saw a dog going 
near the edge to grab a drink. Sud-
denly, the dog fell through the ice, and 
shortly after, the owner dove right in 
to save her pet. Before Tami even saw 
the owner go into the water, she raced 
over to offer assistance. She initially 
tried breaking the ice to get through, 
but she couldn’t puncture enough. With 
quick thinking, Tami then grabbed the 
dog leash from another person walking 
their dog nearby and, after a few at-
tempts, was successfully able to throw 
the leash to the dog owner and pull her 
out of the water. 
Once everyone was out, Tami’s nurse 
instincts and training were able to en-
sure that the owner and dog stayed

warm and not harmed. All the while, 
Tami’s work call was still going on and 
what an explanation she had to give to 
her coworkers. 
Brave acts like this truly showcase 
the best in Kansans. Tami put her life 
on the line to save others, showcasing 
the selfless nature we all possess. She 
is a true hero for her actions and 
makes me proud to be a Kansan. I ask 
my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and recognizing this noble woman.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING GRAND AVENUE 
MARKET 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
today I wish to honor the hard work, 
determination, and sheer grit of the 
community of Plains, KS. Last month, 
Grand Avenue Market, the first gro-
cery store in Plains in more than 20 
years, opened for business. 
For too many across Kansas, food 
deserts—areas with little access to 
fresh produce—are all too common-
place. Last month, thanks to the dec-
ades-long commitment of community 
members in Meade County, especially 
the Community Enhancement Founda-
tion of Plains, the grocery drought was 
finally brought to an end. But it wasn’t 
easy. 
The project to bring a grocery store 
to Plains began in 2008, when the com-
munities of Kismet and Plains raised 
nearly $500,000 out of the $2 million re-
quired for the initiative. Every day 
since, amid turbulence and trial, the 
greater community and the people of 
Plains never gave up. 
After receiving a loan from a USDA, 
the dream of not having to travel be-
tween up to 25 miles to neighboring 
towns to simply get groceries began to 
look more like reality. But hurdles in 
the form of a bank unwilling to honor 
a letter of credit and banks reluctant 
to supply another made that dream 
look rather dim. That is when the com-
munity contacted my office. 
Using our knowledge of USDA rural 
development financing programs, we 
reached out to banks in the area to see 
if they would be willing to participate 
in the project to bring fresh produce to 
Plains. Exploring community banks 
that understand the importance in in-
vesting in community infrastructure, 
one 
bank 
in 
particular 
began 
to 
emerge. 
Heartland Tri State Bank in Elkhart 
simply made this dream of so many in 
southwest Kansas possible. I know I 
speak for all Kansans when I say thank 
you. Thank you for your investment. 
Not merely an investment in a grocery 
store, but a much more important in-
vestment—an investment in people and 
their lives. 
It was my sincerest honor to play a 
small part in helping make Grand Ave-
nue Market a reality. It is with great 
pleasure that I recognize Plains, KS; 
Heartland Tri State Bank; the Commu-
nity 
Enhancement 
Foundation 
of 
Plains; and the surrounding commu-
nity for their diligence, effort, and pure 
will in bringing an end to the grocery 
drought in their parcel of the prairie 
that we Kansans call home.∑
