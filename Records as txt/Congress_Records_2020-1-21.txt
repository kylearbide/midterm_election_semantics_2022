Reverend Benjamin Hogue, Lutheran

prayer: 
God of love, truth, and goodness, You 
promise to join us along the way. 
Give those gathered here open spirits 
to discern Your presence within, open 
minds to legislate and dream with cre-
ative possibility, and open hearts to 
join one another in cooperation, humil-

Remind us of the fierce urgency of

S287 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2020 
No. 12 
Senate 
The Senate met at 12:30 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You are our rock and 
fortress. Keep us from dishonor. Only 
by walking in Your precepts can our 
lawmakers remain within the circle of 
Your protection and blessings. Lord, 
turn their ears to listen to Your admo-
nition, as You infuse them with the 
courage to obey Your commands. We 
have trusted You since the birth of this 
land we love. That is why we will de-
clare Your glory as long as we have 
breath. Lord, as our Senators prepare 
to gather for today’s impeachment 
trial, we declare that You alone are our 
hope. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
Thursday, the U.S. Senate crossed one 
of the greatest thresholds that exist in 
our system of government. We began 
just the third Presidential impeach-
ment trial in American history. This is 
a 
unique 
responsibility 
which 
the 
Framers of our Constitution knew that 
the Senate—and only the Senate— 
could handle. Our Founders trusted the 
Senate to rise above short-term pas-
sions and factionalism. They trusted 
the Senate to soberly consider what 
has actually been proven and which 
outcome best serves the Nation. That 
is a pretty high bar, and you might say 
that later today, this body will take 
our entrance exam. 
Today, we will consider and pass an 
organizing resolution that will struc-
ture the first phase of the trial. This 
initial step will offer an early signal to 
our country. Can the Senate still serve 
our founding purpose? Can we still put 
fairness, evenhandedness, and histor-
ical precedent ahead of the partisan 
passions of the day? Today’s vote will 
contain some answers. The organizing 
resolution we will put forward already 
has the support of a majority of the 
Senate. That is because it sets up a 
structure that is fair, evenhanded, and 
tracks closely with past precedents 
that were established unanimously. 
After pretrial business, the resolu-
tion establishes the four things that 
need to happen next. First, the Senate 
will hear an opening presentation from 
the House managers. Second, we will 
hear from the President’s counsel. 
Third, Senators will be able to seek 
further information by posing written 
questions to either side through the 
Chief Justice. Fourth, with all that in-
formation in hand, the Senate will con-
sider whether we feel any additional 
evidence or witnesses are necessary to 
evaluate whether the House case has 
cleared or failed to clear the high bar 
of overcoming the presumption of inno-
cence and undoing a democratic elec-
tion. 
The Senate’s fair process will draw a 
sharp contrast with the unfair and 
precedent-breaking inquiry that was 
carried on by the House of Representa-
tives. The House broke with precedent 
by denying Members of the Republican 
minority the same rights that Demo-
crats had received when they were in 
the minority back in 1998. Here in the 
Senate, every single Senator will have 
exactly the same rights and exactly 
the same ability to ask questions. 
The House broke with fairness by 
cutting President Trump’s counsel out 
of their inquiry to an unprecedented 
degree. Here in the Senate, the Presi-
dent’s lawyers will finally receive a 
level playing field with the House 
Democrats and will finally be able to 
present the President’s case. Finally, 
some fairness. 
On every point, our straightforward 
resolution will bring the clarity and 
fairness that everyone deserves—the 
President of the United States, the 
House of Representatives, and the 
American people. This is the fair road-
map for our trial. We need it in place 
before we can move forward, so the 
Senate should prepare to remain in ses-
sion today until we complete this reso-
lution and adopt it. 
This basic, four-part structure aligns 
with the first steps of the Clinton im-
peachment trial in 1999. Twenty-one 
years ago, 100 Senators agreed unani-
mously that this roadmap was the 
right way to begin the trial. All 100 
Senators agreed the proper time to 
consider the question of potential wit-
nesses was after—after—opening argu-
ments and Senators’ questions. 
Now, some outside voices have been 
urging the Senate to break with prece-
dent on this question. Loud voices, in-
cluding the leadership of the House ma-
jority, colluded with Senate Democrats 
and tried to force the Senate to 
precommit ourselves to seek specific 
witnesses and documents before Sen-
ators had even heard opening argu-
ments or even asked questions. These 
are 
potential 
witnesses 
whom 
the 
House 
managers 
themselves—them-
selves—declined to hear from, whom 
the House itself declined to pursue 
through the legal system during its 
own inquiry. 
The House was not facing any dead-
line. They were free to run whatever

investigation they wanted to run. If 
they wanted witnesses who would trig-
ger legal battles over Presidential 
privilege, they could have had those 
fights. However, the chairman of the 
House Intelligence Committee and the 
chairman of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee decided not to. They decided 
their inquiry was finished and moved 
right ahead. The House chose not to 
pursue the same witnesses they appar-
ently

like—would

like—the Senate to precommit to pur-
suing ourselves. 
As I have been saying for weeks, no-
body—nobody—will dictate Senate pro-
cedure to U.S. Senators. A majority of 
us are committed to upholding the 
unanimous, bipartisan Clinton prece-
dent against outside influences with re-
spect to the proper timing of these 
midtrial questions. So if any amend-
ments are brought forward to force pre-
mature decisions on midtrial ques-
tions, I will move to table such amend-
ments 
and 
protect 
our 
bipartisan 
precedent. If a Senator moves to amend 
the resolution or to subpoena specific 
witnesses or documents, I will move to 
table such motions because the Senate 
will decide those questions later in the 
trial, just like we did back in 1999. 
Now, today may present a curious 
situation. We may hear House man-
agers 
themselves 
agitate 
for 
such 
amendments. We may hear a team of 
managers led by the House Intelligence 
and Judiciary Committees chairmen 
argue that the Senate must precommit 
ourselves to reopen the very investiga-
tion they themselves oversaw and vol-
untarily shut down. It would be curious 
to hear these two House chairmen 
argue that the Senate must precommit 
ourselves to supplementing their own 
evidentiary record, to enforcing sub-
poenas they refused to enforce, to 
supplementing a case they themselves 
have 
recently 
described 
as 
‘‘over-
whelming’’—‘‘overwhelming’’—and 
‘‘beyond any reasonable doubt.’’ 
These midtrial questions could po-
tentially take us even deeper into even 
more complex constitutional waters. 
For example, many Senators, including 
me, have serious concerns about blur-
ring—blurring—the traditional role be-
tween the House and the Senate within 
the impeachment process. The Con-
stitution divides the power to impeach 
from the power to try. The first be-
longs solely to the House, and with the 
power to impeach comes the responsi-
bility to investigate. 
The Senate agreeing to pick up and 
carry on the House’s inadequate inves-
tigation would set a new precedent 
that could incentivize frequent and 
hasty impeachments from future House 
majorities. 
It 
could 
dramatically 
change the separation of powers be-
tween the House and the Senate if the 
Senate agrees we will conduct both the 
investigation and the trial of an im-
peachment. 
What is more, some of the proposed 
new witnesses include executive branch 
officials whose communications with 
the President and with other executive 
branch officials lie at the very core of 
the President’s constitutional privi-
lege. Pursuing those witnesses could 
indefinitely delay the Senate trial and 
draw our body into a protracted and 
complex legal fight over Presidential 
privilege. Such litigation could poten-
tially have permanent repercussions 
for the separation of powers and the in-
stitution of the Presidency that Sen-
ators would need to consider very, very 
carefully. 
So the Senate is not about to rush 
into these weighty questions without 
discussion and without deliberation— 
without even hearing opening argu-
ments first. There were good reasons 
why 100 out of 100 Senators agreed two 
decades ago to cross these bridges when 
we came to them. That is what we will 
do this time as well. Fair is fair. The 
process was good enough for President 
Clinton, and basic fairness dictates it 
ought to be good enough for this Presi-
dent as well. 
The eyes are on the Senate. The 
country is watching to see if we can 
rise to the occasion. Twenty-one years 
ago, 100 Senators, including a number 
of us who sit in the Chamber today, did 
just that. The body approved a fair, 
commonsense process to guide the be-
ginning of a Presidential impeachment 
trial. Today, two decades later, this 
Senate will retake that entrance exam. 
The basic structure we are proposing is 
just as eminently fair and evenhanded 
as it was back then. The question is 
whether the Senators are themselves 
ready to be as fair and as evenhanded. 
The Senate made a statement 21 
years ago. We said that Presidents of 
either party deserve basic justice and a 
fair process. A challenging political 
moment like today does not make such 
statements less necessary but all the 
more necessary, in fact. 
So I would say to my colleagues 
across the aisle: There is no reason 
why the vote on this resolution ought 
to be remotely partisan. There is no 
reason other than base partisanship to 
say this particular President deserves a 
radically different rule book than what 
was good enough for a past President of 
your own party. I urge every single 
Senator to support our fair resolution. 
I urge everyone to vote to uphold the 
Senate’s unanimous bipartisan prece-
dent of a fair process.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before 
I begin, there has been well-founded 
concern that the additional security 
measures required for access to the 
Galleries during the trial could cause 
reporters to miss some of the events on 
the Senate floor. I want to assure ev-
eryone in the press that I will vocifer-
ously oppose any attempt to begin the 
trial unless the reporters trying to 
enter the Galleries are seated. 
The press is here to inform the Amer-
ican public about these pivotal events 
in our Nation’s history. We must make 
sure they are able to. Some may not 
want what happens here to be public; 
we do. 
Mr. President, after the conclusion of 
my remarks, the Senate will proceed to 
the impeachment trial of President 
Donald John Trump for committing 
high crimes and misdemeanors. Presi-
dent Trump is accused of coercing a 
foreign leader into interfering in our 
elections to benefit himself and then 
doing everything in his power to cover 
it up. If proved, the President’s actions 
are crimes against democracy itself. 
It is hard to imagine a greater sub-
version of our democracy than for pow-
ers outside our borders to determine 
the elections there within. For a for-
eign country to attempt such a thing 
on its own is bad enough. For an Amer-
ican President to deliberately solicit 
such a thing—to blackmail a foreign 
country with military assistance to 
help him win an election—is unimagi-
nably worse. I can’t imagine any other 
President doing this. 
Beyond that, for then the President 
to deny the right of Congress to con-
duct oversight, deny the right to inves-
tigate any of his activities, to say arti-
cle II of the Constitution gives him the 
right to ‘‘do whatever [he] wants’’—we 
are staring down an erosion of the sa-
cred democratic principles for which 
our Founders fought a bloody war of 
independence. Such is the gravity of 
this historic moment. 
Once Senator INHOFE is sworn in at 1 
p.m., the ceremonial functions at the 
beginning of a Presidential trial will be 
complete. The Senate then must deter-
mine the rules of the trial. The Repub-
lican leader will offer an organizing 
resolution that outlines his plan—his 
plan—for the rules of the trial. It is 
completely partisan. It was kept secret 
until the very eve of the trial. Now 
that it is public, it is very easy to see 
why. 
The McConnell rules seem to be de-
signed by President Trump for Presi-
dent Trump. It asks the Senate to rush 
through as fast as possible and makes 
getting evidence as hard as possible. It 
could force presentations to take place 
at 2 o’clock or 3 o’clock in the morning 
so the American people will not see 
them. 
In short, the McConnell resolution 
will result in a rushed trial, with little 
evidence, in the dark of the night—lit-
erally the dark of night. If the Presi-
dent is so confident in his case, if Lead-
er MCCONNELL
is so confident the 
President did nothing wrong, why don’t 
they want the case to be presented in 
broad daylight? 
On something as important as im-
peachment, the McConnell resolution 
is nothing short of a national disgrace. 
This will go down—this resolution—as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S289 
January 21, 2020 
one of the darker moments in the Sen-
ate history, perhaps one of even the 
darkest. 
Leader MCCONNELL has just said he 
wants to go by the Clinton rules. Then 
why did he change them, in four impor-
tant ways at minimum, to all make the 
trial less transparent, less clear, and 
with less evidence? He said he wanted 
to get started in exactly the same way. 
It turns out, contrary to what the lead-
er said—I am amazed he could say it 
with a straight face—that the rules are 
the same as the Clinton rules. The 
rules are not even close to the Clinton 
rules. 
Unlike the Clinton rules, the McCon-
nell resolution does not admit the 
record of the House impeachment pro-
ceedings into evidence. Leader MCCON-
NELL wants a trial with no existing evi-
dence and no new evidence. A trial 
without evidence is not a trial; it is a 
coverup. 
Second, unlike the Clinton rules, the 
McConnell resolution limits presen-
tation by the parties to 24 hours per 
side over only 2 days. We start at 1, 12 
hours a day, we are at 1 a.m., and that 
is without breaks. It will be later. 
Leader MCCONNELL wants to force the 
managers to make important parts of 
their case in the dark of night. 
No. 3, unlike the Clinton rules, the 
McConnell resolution places an addi-
tional hurdle to get witnesses and doc-
uments by requiring a vote on whether 
such motions are even in order. If that 
vote fails, then no motions to subpoena 
witnesses and documents will be in 
order. 
I don’t want anyone on the other side 
to say: I am going to vote no first on 
witnesses, but then later I will deter-
mine—if they vote for McConnell’s res-
olution, they are making it far more 
difficult to vote in the future, later on 
in the trial. 
And finally, unlike the Clinton rules, 
the McConnell resolution allows a mo-
tion to dismiss at any time—any 
time—in the trial. 
In short, contrary to what the leader 
has said, the McConnell rules are not 
at all like the Clinton rules. The Re-
publican leader’s resolution is based 
neither in precedent nor in principle. It 
is driven by partisanship and the poli-
tics of the moment. 
Today I will be offering amendments 
to fix the many flaws in Leader MCCON-
NELL’s deeply unfair resolution and 
seek the witnesses and documents we 
have requested, beginning with an 
amendment to have the Senate sub-
poena White House documents. 
Let me be clear. These amendments 
are not dilatory. They only seek one 
thing: the truth. That means relevant 
documents. That means relevant wit-
nesses. That is the only way to get a 
fair trial, and everyone in this body 
knows it. 
Each Senate impeachment trial in 
our history, all 15 that were brought to 
completion, feature witnesses—every 
single one. 
The witnesses we request are not 
Democrats. They are the President’s 
own men. The documents are not 
Democratic documents. They are docu-
ments, period. We don’t know if the 
evidence of the witnesses or the docu-
ments will be exculpatory to the Presi-
dent or incriminating, but we have an 
obligation—a solemn obligation, par-
ticularly now during this most deep 
and solemn part of our Constitution— 
to seek the truth and then let the chips 
fall where they may. 
My Republican colleagues have of-
fered several explanations for opposing 
witnesses and documents at the start 
of the trial. None of them has much 
merit. Republicans have said we should 
deal with the question of witnesses 
later in the trial. Of course, it makes 
no sense to hear both sides present 
their case first and then afterward de-
cide if the Senate should hear evidence. 
The evidence is supposed to inform ar-
guments, not come after they are com-
pleted. 
Some Republicans have said the Sen-
ate should not go beyond the House 
record by calling any witnesses, but 
the Constitution gives the Senate the 
sole power to try impeachments—not 
the sole power to review, not the sole 
power to rehash but to try. 
Republicans have called our request 
for witnesses and documents political. 
If seeking the truth is political, then 
the Republican Party is in serious 
trouble. 
The White House has said that the 
Articles of Impeachment are brazen 
and wrong. Well, if the President be-
lieves his impeachment is so brazen 
and wrong, why won’t he show us why? 
Why is the President so insistent that 
no one come forward, that no docu-
ments be released? If the President’s 
case is so weak, that none of the Presi-
dent’s men can defend him under oath, 
shame on him and those who allow it 
to happen. What is the President hid-
ing? What are our Republican col-
leagues hiding? If they weren’t afraid 
of the truth, they would say: Go right 
ahead, get at the truth, get witnesses, 
get documents. 
In fact, at no point over the last few 
months have I heard a single, solitary 
argument on the merits of why wit-
nesses and documents should not be 
part of the trial. No Republicans ex-
plained why less evidence is better 
than more evidence. 
Nevertheless, Leader MCCONNELL is 
poised to ask the Senate to begin the 
first impeachment trial of a President 
in history without witnesses; that 
rushes 
through 
the 
arguments 
as 
quickly as possible; that, in ways both 
shameless and subtle, will conceal the 
truth—the truth—from the American 
people. 
Leader MCCONNELL claimed that the 
House ‘‘ran the most rushed, least 
thorough, and most unfair impeach-
ment inquiry in modern history.’’ The 
truth is, Leader MCCONNELL is plotting 
the most rushed, least thorough, and 
most unfair impeachment trial in mod-
ern history, and it begins today. 
The Senate has before it a very 
straightforward question. The Presi-
dent is accused of coercing a foreign 
power to interfere in our elections to 
help himself. It is the job of the Senate 
to determine if these very serious 
charges are true. The very least we can 
do is examine the facts, review the doc-
uments, hear the witnesses, try the 
case, not run from it, not hide from 
it—try it. 
If the President commits high crimes 
and misdemeanors and Congress re-
fuses to act, refuses even to conduct a 
fair trial of his conduct, then Presi-
dents—this President and future Presi-
dents—can commit impeachable crimes 
with impunity, and the order and rigor 
of our democracy will dramatically de-
cline. 
The fail-safe—the final fail-safe of 
our democracy will be rendered mute. 
The most powerful check on the Execu-
tive—the one designed to protect the 
people from tyranny—will be erased. 
In a short time, my colleagues, each 
of us, will face a choice about whether 
to begin this trial in search of the 
truth or in service of the President’s 
desire to cover it up, whether the Sen-
ate will conduct a fair trial and a full 
airing of the facts or rush to a pre-
determined political outcome. 
My colleagues, the eyes of the Na-
tion, the eyes of history, the eyes of 
the Founding Fathers are upon us. His-
tory will be our final judge. Will Sen-
ators rise to the occasion? 
I yield the floor.

[In Proceedings Before the United States 
Senate] 
Answer of President Donald J. Trump 
THE HONORABLE DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESI-
DENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HEREBY RE-
SPONDS: 
The Articles of Impeachment submitted by 
House Democrats are a dangerous attack on 
the right of the American people to freely 
choose their President. This is a brazen and 
unlawful attempt to overturn the results of 
the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 
election—now just months away. The highly 
partisan and reckless obsession with im-
peaching the President began the day he was 
inaugurated and continues to this day. 
The Articles of Impeachment are constitu-
tionally invalid on their face. They fail to al-
lege any crime or violation of law whatso-
ever, let alone ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors,’’ as required by the Constitution. 
They are the result of a lawless process that 
violated basic due process and fundamental 
fairness. Nothing in these Articles could per-
mit even beginning to consider removing a 
duly elected President or warrant nullifying 
an election and subverting the will of the 
American people. 
The Articles of Impeachment now before 
the Senate are an affront to the Constitution 
of the United States, our democratic institu-
tions, and the American people. The Articles 
themselves—and the rigged process that 
brought them here—are a transparently po-
litical act by House Democrats. They debase 
the grave power of impeachment and the sol-
emn responsibility that power entails. They 
must be rejected. The House process violated 
every precedent and every principle of fair-
ness governing impeachment inquiries for 
more than 150 years. Even so, all that House 
Democrats have succeeded in proving is that 
the President did absolutely nothing wrong. 
President Trump categorically and un-
equivocally denies each and every allegation 
in both Articles of Impeachment. The Presi-
dent reserves all rights and all available de-
fenses to the Articles of Impeachment. For 
the reasons set forth in this Answer and in 
the forthcoming Trial Brief, the Senate must 
reject the Articles of Impeachment. 
I. THE FIRST ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT MUST 
BE REJECTED 
The first Article fails on its face to state 
an impeachable offense. It alleges no crimes 
at all, let alone ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors,’’ as required by the Constitution. 
In fact, it alleges no violation of law whatso-
ever. House Democrats’ ‘‘abuse of power’’ 
claim would do lasting damage to the separa-
tion of powers under the Constitution. 
The first Article also fails on the facts, be-
cause President Trump has not in any way 
‘‘abused the powers of the Presidency.’’ At 
all times, the President has faithfully and ef-
fectively executed the duties of his Office on 
behalf of the American people. The Presi-
dent’s actions on the July 25, 2019, telephone 
call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of 
Ukraine (the ‘‘July 25 call’’), as well as on 
the earlier April 21, 2019, telephone call (the 
‘‘April 21 call’’), and in all surrounding and 
related events, were constitutional, perfectly 
legal, completely appropriate, and taken in 
furtherance of our national interest. 
President Trump raised the important 
issue of burden sharing on the July 25 call, 
noting that other European countries such 
as Germany were not carrying their fair 
share. President Trump also raised the im-
portant issue of Ukrainian corruption. Presi-
dent Zelensky acknowledged these concerns 
on that same call. 
Despite House Democrats having run an 
entirely illegitimate and one-sided process, 
several simple facts were established that 
prove the President did nothing wrong: 
First, the transcripts of both the April 21 
call and the July 25 call make absolutely 
clear that the President did nothing wrong. 
Second, 
President 
Zelensky 
and 
other 
Ukrainian officials have repeatedly con-
firmed that the call was ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘nor-
mal,’’ that there was no quid pro quo, and 
that no one pressured them on anything. 
Third, the two individuals who have stated 
for the record that they spoke to the Presi-
dent about the subject actually exonerate 
him. Ambassador to the European Union 
Gordon Sondland stated that when he asked 
the President what he wanted from Ukraine, 
the President said: ‘‘I want nothing. I want 
nothing. I want no quid pro quo.’’ Senator 
Ron Johnson reported that, when he asked 
the President whether there was any connec-
tion between security assistance and inves-
tigations, the President responded: ‘‘No way. 
I would never do that.’’ House Democrats ig-
nore these facts and instead rely entirely on 
assumptions, presumptions, and speculation 
from witnesses with no first-hand knowl-
edge. Their accusations are founded exclu-
sively on inherently unreliable hearsay that 
would never be accepted in any court in our 
country. 
Fourth, the bilateral presidential meeting 
took place in the ordinary course, and the 
security assistance was sent, all without the 
Ukrainian government announcing any in-
vestigations. 
Not only does the evidence collected by 
House Democrats refute each and every one 
of the factual predicates underlying the first 
Article, the transcripts of the April 21 call 
and the July 25 call disprove what the Arti-
cle alleges. When the House Democrats real-
ized this, Mr. Schiff created a fraudulent 
version of the July 25 call and read it to the 
American people at a congressional hearing, 
without disclosing that he was simply mak-
ing it all up. The fact that Mr. Schiff felt the 
need to fabricate a false version of the July 
25 call proves that he and his colleagues 
knew there was absolutely nothing wrong 
with that call. 
House Democrats ran a fundamentally 
flawed and illegitimate process that denied 
the President every basic right, including 
the right to have counsel present, the right 
to cross-examine witnesses, and the right to 
present evidence. Despite all this, the infor-
mation House Democrats assembled actually 
disproves their claims against the President. 
The President acted at all times with full 
constitutional and legal authority and in our 
national interest. He continued his Adminis-
tration’s policy of unprecedented support for 
Ulaaine, including the delivery of lethal 
military aid that was denied to the Ukrain-
ians by the prior administration. 
The first Article is therefore constitu-
tionally invalid, founded on falsehoods, and 
must be rejected. 
II. THE SECOND ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT MUST 
BE REJECTED 
The second Article also fails on its face to 
state an impeachable offense. It does not al-
lege any crime or violation of law whatso-
ever. To the contrary, the President’s asser-
tion of legitimate Executive Branch con-
fidentiality interests grounded in the separa-
tion of powers cannot constitute obstruction 
of Congress. 
Furthermore, the notion that President 
Trump obstructed Congress is absurd. Presi-
dent Trump acted with extraordinary and 
unprecedented transparency by declassifying 
and releasing the transcript of the July 25 
call that is at the heart of this matter. 
Following the President’s disclosure of the 
July 25 call transcript, House Democrats 
issued a series of unconstitutional subpoenas 
for documents and testimony. They issued 
their subpoenas without a congressional vote 
and, therefore, without constitutional au-
thority. They sought testimony from a num-
ber of the President’s closest advisors de-
spite the fact that, under longstanding, bi-
partisan practice of prior administrations of 
both political parties and similarly long-
standing guidance from the Department of 
Justice, those advisors are absolutely im-
mune from compelled testimony before Con-
gress related to their official duties. And

they sought testimony disclosing the Execu-
tive Branch’s confidential communications 
and internal decision-making processes on 
matters of foreign relations and national se-
curity, despite the well-established constitu-
tional privileges and immunities protecting 
such information. As the Supreme Court has 
recognized, the President’s constitutional 
authority to protect the confidentiality of 
Executive Branch information is at its apex 
in the field of foreign relations and national 
security. House Democrats also barred the 
attendance of Executive Branch counsel at 
witness proceedings, thereby preventing the 
President from protecting important Execu-
tive Branch confidentiality interests. 
Notwithstanding these abuses, the Trump 
Administration 
replied 
appropriately 
to 
these subpoenas and identified their con-
stitutional defects. Tellingly, House Demo-
crats did not seek to enforce these constitu-
tionally defective subpoenas in court. To the 
contrary, 
when 
one 
subpoena 
recipient 
sought a declaratory judgment as to the va-
lidity of the subpoena he had received, House 
Democrats quickly withdrew the subpoena to 
prevent the court from issuing a ruling. 
The House may not usurp Executive 
Branch authority and may not bypass our 
Constitution’s system of checks and bal-
ances. Asserting valid constitutional privi-
leges and immunities cannot be an impeach-
able offense. The second Article is therefore 
invalid and must be rejected. 
III. CONCLUSION 
The Articles of Impeachment violate the 
Constitution. They are defective in their en-
tirety. They are the product of invalid pro-
ceedings that flagrantly denied the President 
any due process rights. They rest on dan-
gerous distortions of the Constitution that 
would do lasting damage to our structure of 
government. 
In the the first Article, the House attempts 
to seize the President’s power under Article 
II of the Constitution to determine foreign 
policy. In the second Article, the House at-
tempts to control and penalize the assertion 
of the Executive Branch’s constitutional 
privileges, while simultaneously seeking to 
destroy the Framers’ system of checks and 
balances. By approving the Articles, the 
House violated our constitutional order, ille-
gally abused its power of impeachment, and 
attempted to obstruct President Trump’s 
ability to faithfully execute the duties of his 
Office. They sought to undermine his author-
ity under Article II of the Constitution, 
which vests the entirety of ‘‘[t]he executive 
Power’’ in ‘‘a President of the United States 
of America.’’ 
In order to preserve our constitutional 
structure of government, to reject the poi-
sonous 
partisanship 
that 
the 
Framers 
warned against, to ensure one-party political 
impeachment vendettas do not become the 
‘‘new normal,’’ and to vindicate the will of 
the American people, the Senate must reject 
both Articles of Impeachment. In the end, 
this entire process is nothing more than a 
dangerous attack on the American people 
themselves and their fundamental right to 
vote.

TRIAL MEMORANDUM OF THE UNITED STATES 
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES
IN
THE
IM-
PEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD J. 
TRUMP 
INTRODUCTION 
President Donald J. Trump used his offi-
cial powers to pressure a foreign government 
to interfere in a United States election for 
his personal political gain, and then at-
tempted to cover up his scheme by obstruct-
ing Congress’s investigation into his mis-
conduct. The Constitution provides a remedy 
when the President commits such serious 
abuses of his office: impeachment and re-
moval. The Senate must use that remedy 
now to safeguard the 2020 U.S. election, pro-
tect our constitutional form of government, 
and eliminate the threat that the President 
poses to America’s national security. 
The House adopted two Articles of Im-
peachment against President Trump: the 
first for abuse of power, and the second for 
obstruction of Congress.1 The evidence over-
whelmingly establishes that he is guilty of 
both. The only remaining question is wheth-
er the members of the Senate will accept and 
carry out the responsibility placed on them 
by the Framers of our Constitution and their 
constitutional Oaths. 
ABUSE OF POWER 
President Trump abused the power of his 
office by pressuring the government of 
Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 U.S. Presi-
dential election for his own benefit. In order 
to pressure the recently elected Ukrainian 
President, Volodymyr Zelensky, to announce 
investigations that would advance President 
Trump’s political interests and his 2020 re-
election bid, the President exercised his offi-
cial power to withhold from Ukraine critical 
U.S. government support—$391 million of 
vital military aid and a coveted White House 
meeting.2 
During a July 25, 2019 phone call, after 
President Zelensky expressed gratitude to 
President Trump for American military as-
sistance, President Trump immediately re-
sponded by asking President Zelensky to ‘‘do 
us a favor though.’’ 3 The ‘‘favor’’ he sought 
was for Ukraine to publicly announce two in-
vestigations that President Trump believed 
would improve his domestic political pros-
pects.4 One investigation concerned former 
Vice President Joseph Biden, Jr.—a political 
rival in the upcoming 2020 election—and the 
false claim that, in seeking the removal of a 
corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor four years ear-
lier, then-Vice President Biden had acted to 
protect a company where his son was a board 
member.5
The second investigation con-
cerned a debunked conspiracy theory that 
Russia did not interfere in the 2016 Presi-
dential election to aid President Trump, but 
instead that Ukraine interfered in that elec-
tion to aid President Trump’s opponent, Hil-
lary Clinton.6 
These theories were baseless. There is no 
credible evidence to support the allegation 
that the former Vice President acted improp-
erly in encouraging Ukraine to remove an in-
competent and corrupt prosecutor in 2016.7 
And the U.S. Intelligence Community, the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 
and Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III 
unanimously determined that Russia, not 
Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 U.S. Presi-
dential election ‘‘in sweeping and systematic 
fashion’’ to help President Trump’s cam-
paign.8 In fact, the theory that Ukraine, 
rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 
election has been advanced by Russia’s intel-
ligence services as part of Russia’s propa-
ganda campaign.9 
Although these theories were groundless, 
President Trump sought a public announce-
ment by Ukraine of investigations into them 
in order to help his 2020 reelection cam-
paign.10 An announcement of a Ukrainian in-
vestigation into one of his key political ri-
vals would be enormously valuable to Presi-
dent Trump in his efforts to win reelection 
in 2020—just as the FBI’s investigation into 
Hillary Clinton’s emails had helped him in 
2016. And an investigation suggesting that 
President Trump did not benefit from Rus-
sian interference in the 2016 election would 
give him a basis to assert—falsely—that he 
was the victim, rather than the beneficiary, 
of foreign meddling in the last election. 
Ukraine’s announcement of that investiga-
tion would bolster the perceived legitimacy 
of his Presidency and, therefore, his political 
standing going into the 2020 race. 
Overwhelming evidence shows that Presi-
dent Trump solicited these two investiga-
tions in order to obtain a personal political 
benefit, 
not 
because 
the 
investigations 
served the national interest.11 The Presi-
dent’s own National Security Advisor char-
acterized the efforts to pressure Ukraine to 
announce investigations in exchange for offi-
cial acts as a ‘‘drug deal.’’ 12 His Acting Chief 
of Staff candidly confessed that President 
Trump’s decision to withhold security assist-
ance was tied to his desire for an investiga-
tion into alleged Ukrainian interference in 
the 2020 election, stated that there ‘‘is going 
to be political influence in foreign policy,’’ 
and told the American people to ‘‘get over 
it.’’ 13 Another one of President Trump’s key 
national security advisors testified that the 
agents pursuing the President’s bidding were 
‘‘involved in a domestic political errand,’’ 
not national security policy.14 And, imme-
diately after speaking to President Trump 
by phone about the investigations, one of 
President Trump’s ambassadors involved in 
carrying out the President’s agenda in 
Ukraine said that President Trump ‘‘did not 
give a [expletive] about Ukraine,’’ and in-
stead cared only about ‘‘big stuff’’ that bene-
fitted him personally, like ‘‘the Biden inves-
tigation.’’ 15 
To execute his scheme, President Trump 
assigned 
his 
personal 
attorney, 
Rudy 
Giuliani, the task of securing the Ukrainian 
investigations.16 Mr. Giuliani repeatedly and 
publicly emphasized that he was not engaged 
in foreign policy but was instead seeking a 
personal benefit for his client, Donald 
Trump.17 
President Trump used the vast powers of 
his office as President to pressure Ukraine 
into announcing these investigations. Presi-
dent Trump illegally withheld $391 million in 
taxpayer-funded 
military 
assistance 
to 
Ukraine that Congress had appropriated for 
expenditure in fiscal year 2019.18 That assist-
ance was a critical part of long-running bi-
partisan efforts to advance the security in-
terests of the United States by ensuring that 
Ukraine is properly equipped to defend itself 
against Russian aggression.19 Every relevant 
Executive Branch agency agreed that contin-
ued American support for Ukraine was in 
America’s national security interests, but 
President Trump ignored that view and per-
sonally ordered the assistance held back, 
even after serious concerns—now confirmed 
by the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) 20—were raised within his Administra-
tion about the legality of withholding fund-
ing 
that 
Congress 
had 
already 
appro-
priated.21 President Trump released the fund-
ing only after he got caught trying to use 
the security assistance as leverage to obtain 
foreign interference in his reelection cam-
paign. When news of his scheme to withhold 
the funding broke, and shortly after inves-
tigative committees in the House opened an 
investigation, President Trump relented and 
released the aid.22

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S292 
January 21, 2020 
As part of the same pressure campaign, 
President Trump withheld a crucial White 
House meeting with President Zelensky—a 
meeting that he had previously promised and 
that was a shared goal of both the United 
States and Ukraine.23 Such face-to-face Oval 
Office meetings with a U.S. President are im-
mensely important for international credi-
bility.24 In this case, an Oval Office meeting 
with President Trump was critical to the 
newly elected Ukrainian President because 
it would signal to Russia—which had invaded 
Ukraine in 2014 and still occupied Ukrainian 
territory—that Ukraine 
could 
count 
on 
American support.25 That meeting still has 
not occurred, even though President Trump 
has met with over a dozen world leaders at 
the White House since President Zelensky’s 
election—including an Oval Office meeting 
with Russia’s top diplomat.26 
President Trump’s solicitation of foreign 
interference in our elections to secure his 
own political success is precisely why the 
Framers of our Constitution provided Con-
gress with the power to impeach a corrupt 
President and remove him from office. One 
of the Founding generation’s principal fears 
was that foreign governments would seek to 
manipulate American elections—the defining 
feature of our self-government. Thomas Jef-
ferson and John Adams warned of ‘‘foreign 
Interference, Intrigue, Influence’’ and pre-
dicted that, ‘‘as often as Elections happen, 
the danger of foreign Influence recurs.’’ 27 
The Framers therefore would have consid-
ered a President’s attempt to corrupt Amer-
ica’s democratic processes by demanding po-
litical favors from foreign powers to be a sin-
gularly pernicious act. They designed im-
peachment as the remedy for such mis-
conduct because a President who manipu-
lates U.S. elections to his advantage can 
avoid being held accountable by the voters 
through those same elections. And they 
would have viewed a President’s efforts to 
encourage foreign election interference as all 
the more dangerous where, as here, those ef-
forts are part of an ongoing pattern of mis-
conduct for which the President is unrepent-
ant. 
The House of Representatives gathered 
overwhelming evidence of President Trump’s 
misconduct, which is summarized in the at-
tached Statement of Material Facts and in 
the comprehensive reports prepared by the 
House Permanent Select Committee on In-
telligence and the Committee on the Judici-
ary.28 On the strength of that evidence, the 
House approved the First Article of Impeach-
ment against President Trump for abuse of 
power.29 The Senate should now convict him 
on that Article. President Trump’s con-
tinuing presence in office undermines the in-
tegrity of our democratic processes and en-
dangers our national security. 
OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS 
President Trump obstructed Congress by 
undertaking an unprecedented campaign to 
prevent 
House 
Committees 
from 
inves-
tigating his misconduct. The Constitution 
entrusts the House with the ‘‘sole Power of 
Impeachment.’’ 30 The Framers thus ensured 
what 
common 
sense 
requires—that 
the 
House, and not the President, determines the 
existence, scope, and procedures of an im-
peachment investigation into the President’s 
conduct. The House cannot conduct such an 
investigation effectively if it cannot obtain 
information from the President or the Exec-
utive Branch about the Presidential mis-
conduct it is investigating. Under our con-
stitutional system of divided powers, a Presi-
dent cannot be permitted to hide his offenses 
from view by refusing to comply with a Con-
gressional impeachment inquiry and order-
ing Executive Branch agencies to do the 
same. That conclusion is particularly impor-
tant given the Department of Justice’s posi-
tion that the President cannot be indicted. If 
the President could both avoid account-
ability under the criminal laws and preclude 
an effective impeachment investigation, he 
would truly be above the law. 
But that is what President Trump has at-
tempted to do, and why President Trump’s 
conduct is the Framers’ worst nightmare. He 
directed his Administration to defy every 
subpoena issued in the House’s impeachment 
investigation.31 At his direction, the White 
House, Department of State, Department of 
Defense, Department of Energy, and Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) refused to 
produce a single document in response to 
those subpoenas.32 Several witnesses also fol-
lowed President Trump’s orders, defying re-
quests for voluntary appearances and lawful 
subpoenas, and refusing to testify.33
And 
President 
Trump’s 
interference 
in 
the 
House’s impeachment inquiry was not an iso-
lated incident—it was consistent with his 
past efforts to obstruct the Special Counsel’s 
investigation into Russian interference in 
the 2016 election.34 
By categorically obstructing the House’s 
impeachment 
inquiry, 
President 
Trump 
claimed the House’s sole impeachment power 
for himself and sought to shield his mis-
conduct from Congress and the American 
people. Although his sweeping cover-up ef-
fort ultimately failed—seventeen public offi-
cials courageously upheld their duty, testi-
fied, and provided documentary evidence of 
the President’s wrongdoing 35—his obstruc-
tion will do long-lasting and potentially ir-
reparable damage to our constitutional sys-
tem of divided powers if it goes unchecked. 
Based on the overwhelming evidence of the 
President’s misconduct in attempting to 
thwart the impeachment inquiry, the House 
approved the Second Article of Impeach-
ment, for obstruction of Congress.36 The Sen-
ate should now convict President Trump on 
that Article. If it does not, future Presidents 
will feel empowered to resist any investiga-
tion into their own wrongdoing, effectively 
nullifying Congress’s power to exercise the 
Constitution’s most important safeguard 
against Presidential misconduct. That out-
come would not only embolden this Presi-
dent to continue seeking foreign interference 
in our elections but would telegraph to fu-
ture Presidents that they are free to engage 
in serious misconduct without account-
ability or repercussions. 
The Constitution entrusts Congress with 
the solemn task of impeaching and removing 
from office a President who engages in 
‘‘Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors.’’ 37 The impeachment power 
is an essential check on the authority of the 
President, and Congress must exercise this 
power when the President places his personal 
and political interests above those of the Na-
tion. President Trump has done exactly that. 
His misconduct challenges the fundamental 
principle 
that 
Americans 
should 
decide 
American elections, and that a divided sys-
tem of government, in which no single 
branch operates without the check and bal-
ance of the others, preserves the liberty we 
all hold dear. 
The country is watching to see how the 
Senate responds. History will judge each 
Senator’s willingness to rise above partisan 
differences, view the facts honestly, and de-
fend the Constitution. The outcome of these 
proceedings will determine whether genera-
tions to come will enjoy a safe and secure de-
mocracy in which the President is not a 
king, and in which no one, particularly the 
President, is above the law. 
BACKGROUND 
I. Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Im-
peachment 
To understand why President Trump must 
be removed from office now, it is necessary 
to understand why the Framers of our Con-
stitution included the impeachment power as 
an essential part of the republic they cre-
ated. 
The Constitution entrusts Congress with 
the exclusive power to impeach the Presi-
dent and to convict and remove him from of-
fice. Article I vests the House with the ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment,’’ 38 and the Senate 
with the ‘‘sole Power to try all Impeach-
ments’’ and to ‘‘convict[]’’ upon a vote of 
two thirds of its Members.39 The Constitu-
tion specifies that the President ‘‘shall be re-
moved from Office on Impeachment for, and 
Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other 
high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 40 The Con-
stitution further provides that the Senate 
may vote to permanently ‘‘disqualif[y]’’ an 
impeached President from government serv-
ice.41 
The President takes an oath to ‘‘faithfully 
execute the Office of the President of the 
United States.’’ 42 Impeachment imposes a 
check on a President who violates that oath 
by using the powers of the office to advance 
his own interests at the expense of the na-
tional interest. Fresh from their experience 
under British rule by a king, the Framers 
were concerned that corruption posed a 
grave threat to their new republic. As 
George Mason warned the other delegates to 
the Constitutional Convention, ‘‘if we do not 
provide against corruption, our government 
will soon be at an end.’’ 43
The Framers 
stressed that a President who ‘‘act[s] from 
some corrupt motive or other’’ or ‘‘willfully 
abus[es] his trust’’ must be impeached,44 be-
cause the President ‘‘will have great oppor-
tunitys of abusing his power.’’ 45 
The Framers recognized that a President 
who abuses his power to manipulate the 
democratic process cannot properly be held 
accountable by means of the very elections 
that he has rigged to his advantage.46 The 
Framers specifically feared a President who 
abused his office by sparing ‘‘no efforts or 
means whatever to get himself re-elected.’’ 47 
Mason asked: ‘‘Shall the man who has prac-
tised corruption & by that means procured 
his appointment in the first instance, be suf-
fered to escape punishment, by repeating his 
guilt?’’ 48 
Thus, the Framers resolved to hold the 
President ‘‘impeachable whilst in office’’ as 
‘‘an essential security for the good behaviour 
of the Executive.’’ 49 By empowering Con-
gress to immediately remove a President 
when his misconduct warrants it, the Fram-
ers established the people’s elected rep-
resentatives as the ultimate check on a 
President whose corruption threatened our 
democracy and the Nation’s core interests.50 
The Framers particularly feared that for-
eign influence could undermine our new sys-
tem of self-government.51 In his farewell ad-
dress to the Nation, President George Wash-
ington warned Americans ‘‘to be constantly 
awake, since history and experience prove 
that foreign influence is one of the most 
baneful foes of republican government.’’ 52 
Alexander Hamilton cautioned that the 
‘‘most deadly adversaries of republican gov-
ernment’’ may come ‘‘chiefly from the desire 
in foreign powers to gain an improper as-
cendant in our councils.’’ 53 James Madison 
worried that a future President could ‘‘be-
tray his trust to foreign powers,’’ which 
‘‘might be fatal to the Republic.’’ 54 And, of 
particular relevance now, in their personal 
correspondence 
about 
‘‘foreign 
Inter-
ference,’’ Thomas Jefferson and John Adams 
discussed their apprehension that ‘‘as often 
as Elections happen, the danger of foreign 
Influence recurs.’’ 55 
Guided by these concerns, the Framers in-
cluded 
within 
the 
Constitution

mechanisms to ensure the President’s ac-
countability and protect against foreign in-
fluence—including a requirement that Presi-
dents be natural-born citizens of the United 
States,56 prohibitions on the President’s re-
ceipt of gifts, emoluments, or titles from for-
eign states,57 prohibitions on profiting from 
the Presidency,58 and, of course, the require-
ment that the President face reelection after 
a four-year Term.59 But the Framers pro-
vided for impeachment as a final check on a 
President who sought foreign interference to 
serve his personal interests, particularly to 
secure his own reelection. 
In drafting the Impeachment Clause, the 
Framers adopted a standard flexible enough 
to reach the full range of potential Presi-
dential misconduct: ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or 
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 60 The 
decision to denote ‘‘Treason’’ and ‘‘Bribery’’ 
as impeachable conduct reflects the Found-
ing-era concerns over foreign influence and 
corruption. But the Framers also recognized 
that ‘‘many great and dangerous offenses’’ 
could warrant impeachment and immediate 
removal of a President from office.61 These 
‘‘other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ pro-
vided for by the Constitution need not be in-
dictable criminal offenses. Rather, as Ham-
ilton explained, impeachable offenses involve 
an ‘‘abuse or violation of some public trust’’ 
and are of ‘‘a nature which may with pecu-
liar propriety be denominated political, as 
they relate chiefly to injuries done imme-
diately to the society itself.’’ 62 The Framers 
thus understood that ‘‘high crimes and mis-
demeanors’’ would encompass acts com-
mitted by public officials that inflict severe 
harm on the constitutional order.63 
II. The House’s Impeachment of President Don-
ald J. Trump and Presentation of This Mat-
ter to the Senate 
Committees of the House have undertaken 
investigations 
into 
allegations 
of 
mis-
conduct by President Trump and his Admin-
istration. On September 9, 2019, after evi-
dence surfaced that the President and his as-
sociates were seeking Ukraine’s assistance in 
the President’s reelection, the House Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence, to-
gether with the Committees on Oversight 
and Reform and Foreign Affairs, announced 
a joint investigation into the President’s 
conduct and issued document requests to the 
White House and State Department.64 
On September 24, 2019, Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi announced that the House was ‘‘mov-
ing forward with an official impeachment in-
quiry’’ and directed the Committees to ‘‘pro-
ceed with their investigations under that 
umbrella of [an] impeachment inquiry.’’ 65 
They subsequently issued multiple sub-
poenas for documents as well as requests and 
subpoenas for witness interviews and testi-
mony.66 On October 31, 2019, the House ap-
proved a resolution adopting procedures to 
govern the impeachment inquiry.67 
Both before and after Speaker Pelosi’s an-
nouncement, President Trump categorically 
refused to provide any information in re-
sponse to the House’s inquiry. He stated that 
‘‘we’re fighting all the subpoenas,’’ and that 
‘‘I have an Article II, where I have the right 
to do whatever I want as president.’’ 68 
Through his White House Counsel, the Presi-
dent later directed his Administration not to 
cooperate.69 Heeding the President’s direc-
tive, the Executive Branch did not produce 
any documents in response to subpoenas 
issued by the three investigating Commit-
tees,70 and nine current or former Adminis-
tration officials, including the President’s 
top aides, continue to refuse to comply with 
subpoenas for testimony.71 
Notwithstanding 
the 
President’s 
at-
tempted cover-up, seventeen current and 
former government officials courageously 
complied with their legal obligations and 
testified before the three investigating Com-
mittees in depositions or transcribed inter-
views that all Members of the Committees— 
as well as staff from the Majority and Minor-
ity—were permitted to attend.72 Some wit-
nesses produced documentary evidence in 
their possession. In late November 2019, 
twelve of these witnesses, including three re-
quested by the Minority, testified in public 
hearings convened by the Intelligence Com-
mittee.73 
Stressing the ‘‘overwhelming’’ evidence of 
misconduct already uncovered by the inves-
tigation, on December 3, 2019, the Intel-
ligence Committee released a detailed nearly 
300-page report documenting its findings, 
which it transmitted to the Judiciary Com-
mittee.74 The Judiciary Committee held pub-
lic hearings evaluating the constitutional 
standard for impeachment and the evidence 
against President Trump—in which the 
President’s counsel was invited, but de-
clined, to participate—and then reported two 
Articles of Impeachment to the House.75 
On December 18, 2019, the House voted to 
impeach President Trump and adopted two 
Articles of Impeachment.76 The First Article 
for Abuse of Power states that President 
Trump ‘‘abused the powers of the Presi-
dency’’ by ‘‘soliciting the Government of 
Ukraine to publicly announce investigations 
that would benefit his reelection, harm the 
election prospects of a political opponent, 
and influence the 2020 United States Presi-
dential election to his advantage.’’ 77 Presi-
dent Trump sought to ‘‘pressure the Govern-
ment of Ukraine to take these steps by con-
ditioning official United States Government 
acts of significant value to Ukraine on its 
public 
announcement 
of 
the 
investiga-
tions.’’ 78 President Trump undertook these 
acts ‘‘for corrupt purposes in pursuit of per-
sonal political benefit’’ 79 and ‘‘used the pow-
ers of the Presidency in a manner that com-
promised the national security of the United 
States and undermined the integrity of the 
United States democratic process.’’ 80 These 
actions were ‘‘consistent’’ with President 
Trump’s ‘‘previous invitations of foreign in-
terference in United States elections,’’ 81 and 
demonstrated that President Trump ‘‘will re-
main a threat to national security and the 
Constitution if allowed to remain in of-
fice.’’ 82 
The Second Article for Obstruction of Con-
gress states that President Trump ‘‘abused 
the powers of the Presidency in a manner of-
fensive to, and subversive of, the Constitu-
tion’’ when he ‘‘directed the unprecedented, 
categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of 
subpoenas issued by the House of Represent-
atives pursuant to its ‘sole Power of Im-
peachment.’ ’’ 83 Without ‘‘lawful cause or ex-
cuse, President Trump directed Executive 
Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to 
comply with those subpoenas’’ and ‘‘thus 
interposed the powers of the Presidency 
against the lawful subpoenas of the House of 
Representatives, and assumed to himself 
functions and judgments necessary to the ex-
ercise of the ‘sole Power of Impeachment’ 
vested by the Constitution in the House of 
Representatives.’’ 84 The President’s ‘‘com-
plete defiance of an impeachment inquiry 
. . . served to cover up the President’s own 
repeated misconduct and to seize and control 
the power of impeachment.’’ 85
President 
Trump’s misconduct was ‘‘consistent’’ with 
his ‘‘previous efforts to undermine United 
States Government investigations into for-
eign interference in United States elec-
tions,’’ 86 demonstrated that he has ‘‘acted in 
a manner grossly incompatible with self-gov-
ernance,’’ and established that he ‘‘will re-
main a threat to the Constitution if allowed 
to remain in office.’’ 87 
ARGUMENT 
I. The Senate Should Convict President Trump 
of Abuse of Power 
President Trump abused the power of the 
Presidency by pressuring a foreign govern-
ment to interfere in an American election on 
his behalf.88 He solicited this foreign inter-
ference to advance his reelection prospects 
at the expense of America’s national secu-
rity and the security of Ukraine, a vulner-
able American ally at war with Russia, an 
American adversary.89 His effort to gain a 
personal political benefit by encouraging a 
foreign government to undermine America’s 
democratic process strikes at the core of 
misconduct that the Framers designed im-
peachment to protect against. President 
Trump’s abuse of power requires his convic-
tion and removal from office. 
An officer abuses his power if he exercises 
his official power to obtain an improper per-
sonal benefit while ignoring or undermining 
the national interest.90 An abuse that in-
volves an effort to solicit foreign inter-
ference in an American election is uniquely 
dangerous. President Trump’s misconduct is 
an impeachable abuse of power.91 
A. President Trump Exercised His Official 
Power to Pressure Ukraine into Aiding His 
Reelection 
After President Zelensky won a landslide 
victory in Ukraine in April 2019, President 
Trump pressured the new Ukrainian Presi-
dent to help him win his own reelection by 
announcing investigations that were politi-
cally favorable for President Trump and de-
signed to harm his political rival.92 
First, President Trump sought to pressure 
President Zelensky publicly to announce an 
investigation into former Vice President 
Biden 
and 
a 
Ukrainian 
gas 
company, 
Burisma Holdings, on whose board Biden’s 
son sat.93 As Vice President, Biden had in 
late 2015 encouraged the government of 
Ukraine to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor 
general who had failed to combat corrup-
tion.94 The Ukrainian parliament removed 
the prosecutor in March 2016.95
President 
Trump and his allies have asserted that the 
former Vice President acted in order to stop 
an investigation of Burisma and thereby pro-
tect his son.96 This is false. There is no evi-
dence that Vice President Biden acted im-
properly.97
He was carrying out official 
United States policy—with the backing of 
the international community and bipartisan 
support in Congress—when he sought the re-
moval of the prosecutor, who was himself 
corrupt.98 In addition, the prosecutor’s re-
moval made it more likely that the investiga-
tion into Burisma would be pursued.99 Presi-
dent Trump nevertheless sought an official 
Ukrainian announcement of an investigation 
into this theory.100 
Second, President Trump sought to pres-
sure President Zelensky publicly to an-
nounce an investigation into a conspiracy 
theory that Ukraine had colluded with the 
Democratic National Committee to interfere 
in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election in order 
to help the campaign of Hillary Clinton 
against then-candidate Donald Trump.101 
This theory was not only pure fiction, but 
malign Russian propaganda.102 In the words 
of one of President Trump’s own top Na-
tional Security Council officials, President 
Trump’s theory of Ukrainian election inter-
ference is ‘‘a fictional narrative that is being 
perpetrated and propagated by the Russian 
security services themselves’’ to deflect from 
Russia’s culpability and to drive a wedge be-
tween the United States and Ukraine.103 
President Trump’s own FBI Director con-
firmed that American law enforcement has 
‘‘no information that indicates that Ukraine 
interfered with the 2016 presidential elec-
tion.’’ 104 The Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence similarly concluded that Russia, 
not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 U.S. Pres-
idential election.105 President Trump never-
theless seized on the false theory and sought 
an announcement of an investigation that 
would give him a basis to assert that 
Ukraine rather than Russia interfered in the 
2016 election. Such an investigation would 
eliminate a perceived threat to his own le-
gitimacy and boost his political standing in 
advance of the 2020 election.106 
In furtherance of the corrupt scheme, 
President Trump exercised his official power 
to remove a perceived obstacle to Ukraine’s 
pursuit of the two sham investigations. On 
April 24, 2019—one day after the media re-
ported that former Vice President Biden 
would formally enter the 2020 U.S. Presi-
dential race 107—the State Department exe-
cuted President Trump’s order to recall the 
U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a well-regarded 
career diplomat and anti-corruption cru-
sader.108 President Trump needed her ‘‘out of 
the way’’ because ‘‘she was going to make 
the 
investigations 
difficult 
for 
every-
body.’’ 109 President Trump then proceeded to 
exercise 
his 
official 
power 
to 
pressure 
Ukraine into announcing his desired inves-
tigations by withholding valuable support 
that Ukraine desperately needed and that he 
could leverage only by virtue of his office: 
$391 million in security assistance and a 
White House meeting. 
WITHHELD SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
President Trump illegally ordered the Of-
fice of Management and Budget to withhold 
$391 million in taxpayer-funded military and 
other security assistance to Ukraine.110 This 
assistance would provide Ukraine with snip-
er rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 
counter-artillery radars, electronic warfare 
detection and secure communications, and 
night vision equipment, among other mili-
tary equipment, to defend itself against Rus-
sian forces that occupied part of eastern 
Ukraine since 2014.111 The new and vulner-
able 
government 
headed 
by 
President 
Zelensky urgently needed this assistance— 
both because the funding itself was critically 
important to defend against Russia, and be-
cause the funding was a highly visible sign of 
American support for President Zelensky in 
his efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict 
from a position of strength.112 
Every relevant Executive Branch agency 
supported the assistance, which also had 
broad bipartisan support in Congress.113 
President Trump, however, personally or-
dered OMB to withhold the assistance after 
the bulk of it had been appropriated by Con-
gress and all of the Congressionally man-
dated conditions on assistance—including 
anti-corruption reforms—had been met.114 
The Government Accountability Office has 
determined that the President’s hold was il-
legal and violated the Impoundment Control 
Act, which limits the President’s authority 
to withhold funds that Congress has appro-
priated.115 
The evidence is clear that President Trump 
conditioned release of the vital military as-
sistance on Ukraine’s announcement of the 
sham investigations. During a telephone con-
versation between the two Presidents on 
July 
25, 
immediately 
after 
President 
Zelensky raised the issue of U.S. military 
support for Ukraine, President Trump re-
plied: ‘‘I would like you to do us a favor 
though.’’ 116 President Trump then explained 
that 
the 
‘‘favor’’ 
he 
wanted 
President 
Zelensky to perform was to begin the inves-
tigations, and President Zelensky confirmed 
his understanding that the investigations 
should be done ‘‘openly.’’ 117 In describing 
whom he wanted Ukraine to investigate, 
President Trump mentioned only two people: 
former Vice President Biden and his son.118 
And in describing the claim of foreign inter-
ference in the 2016 election, President Trump 
declared that ‘‘they say a lot of it started 
with Ukraine,’’ and that ‘‘[w]hatever you can 
do, it’s very important that you do it if 
that’s possible.’’ 119 Absent from the discus-
sion was any mention by President Trump of 
anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine. 
One of President Trump’s chief agents for 
carrying out the President’s agenda in 
Ukraine, Ambassador Gordon Sondland, tes-
tified that President Trump’s effort to condi-
tion release of the much-needed security as-
sistance on an announcement of the inves-
tigations was as clear as ‘‘two plus two 
equals four.’’ 120 Sondland communicated to 
President Zelensky’s advisor that Ukraine 
would likely not receive assistance unless 
President Zelensky publicly announced the 
investigations.121 And President Trump later 
confirmed to Ambassador Sondland that 
President Zelensky ‘‘must announce the 
opening of the investigations and he should 
want to do it.’’ 122 
President Trump ultimately released the 
military assistance, but only after the press 
publicly reported the hold, after the Presi-
dent learned that a whistleblower within the 
Intelligence Community had filed a com-
plaint about his misconduct, and after the 
House publicly announced an investigation 
of the President’s scheme. In short, Presi-
dent Trump released the security assistance 
for Ukraine only after he got caught.123 
WITHHELD WHITE HOUSE MEETING 
On April 21, 2019, the day President 
Zelensky was elected, President Trump in-
vited him to a meeting at the White 
House.124 The meeting would have signaled 
American support for the new Ukrainian ad-
ministration, its strong anti-corruption re-
form agenda, and its efforts to defend 
against Russian aggression and to make 
peace.125
President Trump, however, exer-
cised his official power to withhold the meet-
ing as leverage in his scheme to pressure 
President Zelensky into announcing the in-
vestigations to help his reelection campaign. 
The evidence is unambiguous that Presi-
dent Trump and his agents conditioned the 
White House meeting on Ukraine’s an-
nouncement of the investigations. Ambas-
sador Sondland testified that President 
Trump wanted ‘‘a public statement from 
President Zelensky’’ committing to the in-
vestigations as a ‘‘prerequisite[]’’ for the 
White 
House 
meeting.126
Ambassador 
Sondland further testified: ‘‘I know that 
members of this committee frequently frame 
these complicated issues in the form of a 
simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? 
As I testified previously with regard to the 
requested White House call and the White 
House meeting, the answer is yes.’’ 127 
To this day, President Trump maintains 
leverage over President Zelensky. A White 
House meeting has still not taken place,128 
and President Trump continues publicly to 
urge Ukraine to conduct these investiga-
tions.129 
B. President Trump Exercised Official Power 
to Benefit Himself Personally 
Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that 
the 
announcement 
of 
investigations 
on 
which President Trump conditioned the offi-
cial acts had no legitimate policy rationale, 
and instead were corruptly intended to assist 
his 2020 reelection campaign.130 
First, although there was no basis for the 
two 
conspiracy 
theories 
that 
President 
Trump advanced,131
public announcements 
that these theories were being investigated 
would be of immense political value to him— 
and him alone. The public announcement of 
an investigation of former Vice President 
Biden would yield enormous political bene-
fits for President Trump, who viewed the 
former Vice President as a serious political 
rival in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. 
Unsurprisingly, President Trump’s efforts to 
advance the conspiracy theory accelerated 
after news broke that Vice President Biden 
would run for President in 2020.132 President 
Trump benefited from such an announce-
ment of a criminal investigation into his 
Presidential opponent in 2016.133
An an-
nouncement of a criminal investigation re-
garding a 2020 rival would likewise be ex-
tremely helpful to his reelection prospects. 
President Trump would similarly have 
viewed an investigation into Ukrainian in-
terference in the 2016 election as helpful in 
undermining the conclusion that he had ben-
efitted from Russian election interference in 
2016, and that he was the preferred candidate 
of President Putin—both of which President 
Trump viewed as calling into question the le-
gitimacy of his Presidency. An announce-
ment that Ukraine was investigating its own 
alleged 2016 election interference would have 
turned these facts on their head. President 
Trump would have grounds to claim—false-
ly—that he was elected President in 2016 not 
because he was the beneficiary of Russian 
election interference, but in spite of Ukrain-
ian election interference aimed at helping 
his opponent. 
Second, agents and associates of President 
Trump who helped carry out his agenda in 
Ukraine confirmed that his efforts to pres-
sure President Zelensky into announcing the 
desired investigations were intended for his 
personal political benefit rather than for a 
legitimate policy purpose. For example, 
after speaking with President Trump, Am-
bassador Sondland told a colleague that 
President Trump ‘‘did not give a [expletive] 
about Ukraine,’’ and instead cared only 
about ‘‘big stuff’’ that benefitted him person-
ally ‘‘like the Biden investigation that Mr. 
Giuliani 
was 
pushing.’’ 134
And 
Mick 
Mulvaney, President Trump’s Acting Chief of 
Staff, acknowledged to a reporter that there 
was a quid pro quo with Ukraine involving 
the military aid, conceded that ‘‘[t]here is 
going to be political influence in foreign pol-
icy,’’ and stated, ‘‘I have news for everybody: 
get over it.’’ 135 
Third, 
the 
involvement 
of 
President 
Trump’s personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani— 
who has professional obligations to the 
President but not the Nation—underscores 
that President Trump sought the investiga-
tions for personal and political reasons rath-
er than legitimate foreign policy reasons. 
Mr. Giuliani openly and repeatedly acknowl-
edged that he was pursuing the Ukrainian in-
vestigations to advance the President’s in-
terests, stating: ‘‘this isn’t foreign pol-
icy.’’ 136 Instead, Mr. Giuliani said that he 
was seeking information that ‘‘will be very, 
very helpful to my client.’’ 137 Mr. Giuliani 
made similar representations to the Ukrain-
ian government. In a letter to President- 
elect Zelensky, Mr. Giuliani stated that he 
‘‘represent[ed] him [President Trump] as a 
private citizen, not as President of the United 
States’’ and was acting with the President’s 
‘‘knowledge 
and 
consent.’’ 138
President 
Trump placed Mr. Giuliani at the hub of the 
pressure campaign on Ukraine, and directed 
U.S. officials responsible for Ukraine to 
‘‘talk to Rudy.’’ 139 Indeed, during their July 
25 call, President Trump pressed President 
Zelensky to speak with Mr. Giuliani di-
rectly, stating: ‘‘Rudy very much knows 
what’s happening and he is a very capable 
guy. If you could speak to him that would be 
great.’’ 140 
Fourth, President Trump’s pursuit of the 
sham investigations marked a dramatic de-
viation from longstanding bipartisan Amer-
ican foreign policy goals in Ukraine. Legiti-
mate investigations could have been recog-
nized as an anti-corruption foreign policy

January 21, 2020 
goal, but there was no factual basis for an in-
vestigation into the Bidens or into supposed 
Ukrainian interference in the 2016 elec-
tion.141 To the contrary, the requested inves-
tigations were precisely the type of political 
investigations that American foreign policy 
dissuades other countries from undertaking. 
That explains why the scheme to obtain the 
announcements was pursued through the 
President’s chosen political appointees and 
his personal attorney; 142 why Trump Admin-
istration officials attempted to keep the 
scheme from becoming public due to its 
‘‘sensitive nature’’; 143 why no credible expla-
nation for the hold on security assistance 
was provided even within the U.S. govern-
ment; 144 why, over Defense Department ob-
jections, President Trump and his allies vio-
lated the law by withholding the aid; 145 and 
why, after the scheme was uncovered, Presi-
dent Trump falsely claimed that his pursuit 
of the investigations did not involve a quid 
pro quo.146 
Fifth, American and Ukrainian officials 
alike saw President Trump’s scheme for 
what it was: improper and political. As we 
expect the testimony of Ambassador John 
Bolton would confirm, President Trump’s 
National Security Advisor stated that he 
wanted no ‘‘part of whatever drug deal’’ 
President Trump’s agents were pursuing in 
Ukraine.147 Dr. Hill testified that Ambas-
sador Sondland was becoming involved in a 
‘‘domestic 
political 
errand’’ 
in 
pressing 
Ukraine to announce the investigations.148 
Jennifer Williams, an advisor to Vice Presi-
dent Mike Pence, testified that the Presi-
dent’s solicitation of investigations was a 
‘‘domestic political matter.’’ 149
Lt. Col. 
Alexander Vindman, the NSC’s Director for 
Ukraine, testified that ‘‘[i]t is improper for 
the President of the United States to de-
mand a foreign government investigate a 
U.S. citizen and a political opponent.’’ 150 
William Taylor, who took over as Charge´ 
d’Affaires in Kyiv after President Trump re-
called Ambassador Yovanovitch, emphasized 
that ‘‘I think it’s crazy to withhold security 
assistance for help with a political cam-
paign.’’ 151 And George Kent, a State Depart-
ment official, testified that ‘‘asking another 
country to investigate a prosecution for po-
litical reasons undermines our advocacy of 
the rule of law.’’ 152 
Ukrainian officials also understood that 
President Trump’s corrupt effort to solicit 
the sham investigations would drag them 
into domestic U.S. politics. In response to 
the President’s efforts, a senior Ukrainian 
official conveyed to Ambassador Taylor that 
President Zelensky ‘‘did not want to be used 
as a pawn in a U.S. reelection campaign.’’ 153 
Another Ukrainian official later stated that 
‘‘it’s critically important for the west not to 
pull us into some conflicts between their rul-
ing elites[.]’’ 154 And when Ambassador Kurt 
Volker tried to warn President Zelensky’s 
advisor 
against 
investigating 
President 
Zelensky’s former political opponent—the 
prior Ukrainian president—the advisor re-
torted, ‘‘What, you mean like asking us to 
investigate Clinton and Biden?’’ 155
David 
Holmes, a career diplomat at the U.S. Em-
bassy in Kyiv, highlighted this hypocrisy: 
‘‘While we had advised our Ukrainian coun-
terparts to voice a commitment to following 
the rule of law and generally investigating 
credible corruption allegations,’’ U.S. offi-
cials were making ‘‘a demand that President 
Zelensky personally commit on a cable news 
channel to a specific investigation of Presi-
dent Trump’s political rival.’’ 156 
Finally, there is no credible alternative ex-
planation for President Trump’s conduct. It 
is not credible that President Trump sought 
announcements of the investigations because 
he was in fact concerned with corruption in 
Ukraine or burden-sharing with our Euro-
pean allies, as he claimed after the scheme 
was uncovered.157 
Before news of former Vice President 
Biden’s candidacy broke, President Trump 
showed no interest in corruption in Ukraine, 
and in prior years he approved military as-
sistance to Ukraine without controversy.158 
After his candidacy was announced, Presi-
dent Trump remained indifferent to anti-cor-
ruption measures beyond the two investiga-
tions he was demanding.159 When he first 
spoke with President Zelensky on April 21, 
President Trump ignored the recommenda-
tion of his national security advisors and did 
not mention corruption at all—even though 
the purpose of the call was to congratulate 
President Zelensky on a victory based on an 
anti-corruption 
platform.160
President 
Trump’s entire policy team agreed that 
President Zelensky was genuinely com-
mitted to reforms, yet President Trump re-
fused a White House meeting that the team 
advised would support President Zelensky’s 
anti-corruption agenda.161 President Trump’s 
own Department of Defense, in consultation 
with the State Department, had certified in 
May 2019 that Ukraine satisfied all anti-cor-
ruption standards needed to receive the Con-
gressionally appropriated military aid, yet 
President Trump nevertheless withheld that 
vital assistance.162 He recalled without ex-
planation Ambassador Yovanovitch, who was 
widely recognized as a champion in fighting 
corruption,163 disparaged her while praising a 
corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor general,164 and 
oversaw efforts to cut foreign programs 
tasked 
with 
combating 
corruption 
in 
Ukraine and elsewhere.165 
Moreover, had President Trump truly 
sought to assist Ukraine’s anti-corruption 
efforts, he would have focused on ensuring 
that Ukraine actually conducted investiga-
tions of the purported issues he identified. 
But actual investigations were never the 
point. President Trump was interested only 
in the announcement of the investigations be-
cause that announcement would accomplish 
his real goal—bolstering his reelection ef-
forts.166 
President 
Trump’s 
purported 
concern 
about sharing the burden of assistance to 
Ukraine with Europe is equally without 
basis. From the time OMB announced the il-
legal hold until it was lifted, no credible rea-
son was provided to Executive Branch agen-
cies for the hold, despite repeated efforts by 
national security officials to obtain an ex-
planation.167 It was not until September— 
approximately two months after President 
Trump had directed the hold and after the 
President had learned of the whistleblower 
complaint—that the hold, for the first time, 
was attributed to the President’s concern 
about other countries not contributing more 
to Ukraine.168 If the President was genuinely 
concerned about burden-sharing, it makes no 
sense that he kept his own Administration in 
the dark about the issue for months, never 
made any contemporaneous public state-
ments about it, never ordered a review of 
burden-sharing,169 never ordered his officials 
to push Europe to increase their contribu-
tions,170 and then released the aid without 
any change in Europe’s contribution.171 The 
concern about burden-sharing is an after- 
the-fact rationalization designed to conceal 
President Trump’s abuse of power. 
C. President Trump Jeopardized U.S. 
National Interests 
President Trump’s efforts to solicit foreign 
interference to help his reelection campaign 
is pernicious, but his conduct is all the more 
alarming because it endangered U.S. na-
tional security, jeopardized our alliances, 
and undermined our efforts to promote the 
rule of law globally. 
Ukraine is a ‘‘strategic partner of the 
United States’’ on the front lines of an ongo-
ing conflict with Russia.172
The United 
States has approved military assistance to 
Ukraine with bipartisan support since 2014, 
and that assistance is critical to preventing 
Russia’s expansion and aggression. This mili-
tary 
assistance—which 
President 
Trump 
withheld in service of his own political inter-
ests—‘‘saves lives’’ by making Ukrainian re-
sistance to Russia more effective.173 It like-
wise advances American national security 
interests because, ‘‘[i]f Russia prevails and 
Ukraine falls to Russian dominion, we can 
expect to see other attempts by Russia to ex-
pand its territory and influence.’’ 174 Indeed, 
the reason the United States provides assist-
ance to the Ukrainian military is ‘‘so that 
they can fight Russia over there, and we 
don’t have to fight Russia here.’’ 175 Presi-
dent Trump’s delay in providing the military 
assistance jeopardized these national secu-
rity interests and emboldened Russia even 
though the funding was ultimately re-
leased—particularly because the delay oc-
curred ‘‘when Russia was watching closely to 
gauge the level of American support for the 
Ukrainian Government.’’ 176 But for a subse-
quent act of Congress, approximately $35 
million of military assistance to Ukraine 
would have lapsed and been unavailable as a 
result of the President’s abuse of power.177 
The White House meeting that President 
Trump promised President Zelensky—but 
continues to withhold—would similarly have 
signaled to Russia that the United States 
stands behind Ukraine, showing ‘‘U.S. sup-
port at the highest levels.’’ 178 By refusing to 
hold this meeting, President Trump denied 
Ukraine a showing of strength that could 
deter further Russian aggression and help 
Ukraine negotiate a favorable end to its war 
with Russia.179 The withheld meeting also 
undercuts President Zelensky’s domestic 
standing, diminishing his ability to advance 
his ambitious anti-corruption reforms.180 
Equally 
troubling 
is 
that 
President 
Trump’s scheme sent a clear message to our 
allies that the United States may capri-
ciously withhold critical assistance for our 
President’s personal benefit, causing our al-
lies to constantly ‘‘question the extent to 
which they can count on us.’’ 181 Because 
American leadership depends on ‘‘the power 
of our example and the consistency of our 
purpose,’’ President Trump’s ‘‘conduct un-
dermines the U.S., exposes our friends, and 
widens the playing field for autocrats like 
President Putin.’’ 182 And President Trump’s 
use of official acts to pressure Ukraine to an-
nounce politically motivated investigations 
harms our credibility in promoting demo-
cratic values and the rule of law in Ukraine 
and around the world. American credibility 
abroad ‘‘is based on a respect for the United 
States,’’ and ‘‘if we damage that respect,’’ 
American foreign policy cannot do its job.183 
President Trump abused the powers of his 
office to invite foreign interference in an 
election for his own personal political gain 
and to the detriment of American national 
security interests. He abandoned his oath to 
faithfully execute the laws and betrayed his 
public trust. President Trump’s misconduct 
presents a danger to our democratic proc-
esses, our national security, and our com-
mitment to the rule of law. He must be re-
moved from office. 
II. The Senate Should Convict President Trump 
of Obstruction of Congress 
In exercising its responsibility to inves-
tigate and consider the impeachment of a 
President of the United States, the House is 
constitutionally entitled to the relevant in-
formation from the Executive Branch con-
cerning the President’s misconduct.184 The 
Framers, the courts, and past Presidents 
have recognized that honoring Congress’s

January 21, 2020 
right to information in an impeachment in-
vestigation is a critical safeguard in our sys-
tem of divided powers.185 Otherwise, a Presi-
dent could hide his own wrongdoing to pre-
vent Congress from discovering impeachable 
misconduct, effectively nullifying Congress’s 
impeachment power.186
President Trump’s 
sweeping effort to shield his misconduct 
from view and protect himself from impeach-
ment thus works a grave constitutional 
harm and is itself an impeachable offense. 
A. The House Is Constitutionally Entitled to 
the Relevant Information in an Impeach-
ment Inquiry 
The House has the power to issue sub-
poenas and demand compliance in an im-
peachment 
investigation. 
The 
Supreme 
Court has long recognized that, ‘‘[w]ithout 
the power to investigate—including of course 
the authority to compel testimony, either 
through its own processes or through judi-
cial trial—Congress could be seriously handi-
capped in its efforts to exercise its constitu-
tional function wisely and effectively.’’ 187 
The Court has stressed that it is the ‘‘duty of 
all citizens’’ and ‘‘their unremitting obliga-
tion to respond to subpoenas, to respect the 
dignity of the Congress and its committees 
and to testify fully with respect to matters 
within the province of proper investiga-
tion.’’ 188 The Court has repeatedly empha-
sized that Congress’s ‘‘power of inquiry— 
with process to enforce it—is an essential 
and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative 
function.’’ 189
Congress 
‘‘cannot 
legislate 
wisely or effectively in the absence of infor-
mation.’’ 190 
This principle is most compelling when the 
House exercises its ‘‘sole Power of Impeach-
ment.’’ Congress’s already ‘‘broad’’ inves-
tigatory authority,191 and its need for infor-
mation, are at their apex in an impeachment 
inquiry. The principle that the President 
cannot stand in the way of an impeachment 
investigation is ‘‘of great consequence’’ be-
cause, as Supreme Court Justice Joseph 
Story long ago explained, ‘‘the president 
should not have the power of preventing a 
thorough investigation of [his] conduct, or of 
securing [himself] against the disgrace of a 
public conviction by impeachment, if [he] 
should deserve it.’’ 192
A Presidential im-
peachment is ‘‘a matter of the most critical 
moment to the Nation’’ and it is ‘‘difficult to 
conceive of a more compelling need than 
that of this country for an unswervingly fair 
inquiry based on all the pertinent informa-
tion.’’ 193 The Supreme Court thus recognized 
nearly 140 years ago that where the House or 
Senate is determining a ‘‘question of . . . im-
peachment,’’ there is ‘‘no reason to doubt 
the right to compel the attendance of wit-
nesses, and their answer to proper questions, 
in the same manner and by the use of the 
same means that courts of justice can in like 
cases.’’ 194 
Like the Supreme Court, members of the 
earliest Congresses understood that, without 
‘‘the right to inspect every paper and trans-
action in any department . . . the power of 
impeachment could never be exercised with 
any effect.’’ 195 Previous Presidents have ac-
knowledged their obligation to comply with 
an impeachment investigation, explaining 
that such an inquiry ‘‘penetrate[s] into the 
most secret recesses of the Executive De-
partments’’ and ‘‘could command the attend-
ance of any and every agent of the Govern-
ment, and compel them to produce all pa-
pers, public or private, official or unofficial, 
and to testify on oath to all facts within 
their knowledge.’’ 196 That acknowledgement 
is a matter of common sense. An impeach-
ment inquiry cannot root out bad actors if 
those same bad actors control the scope and 
nature of the inquiry. 
President Trump is an aberration among 
Presidents in refusing any and all coopera-
tion in a House impeachment investigation. 
Even President Nixon produced numerous 
documents in response to Congressional sub-
poenas and instructed ‘‘[a]ll members of the 
White House Staff . . . [to] appear volun-
tarily when requested by the [House],’’ to 
‘‘testify under oath,’’ and to ‘‘answer fully 
all proper questions’’ 197—consistent with the 
near uniform cooperation of prior Executive 
Branch officials who had been subject to im-
peachment investigations.198 
Because President Nixon’s production of 
records in response to the House Judiciary 
Committee’s inquiry was incomplete in im-
portant respects, however, the Committee 
voted to adopt an article of impeachment for 
his obstruction of the inquiry.199 As the Com-
mittee explained, in refusing to provide ma-
terials that the Committee ‘‘deemed nec-
essary’’ to the impeachment investigation, 
President Nixon had ‘‘substitute[ed] his 
judgment’’ for that of the House and inter-
posed ‘‘the powers of the presidency against 
the lawful subpoenas of the House of Rep-
resentatives, thereby assuming to himself 
functions and judgments necessary to exer-
cise the sole power of impeachment vested 
by the Constitution in the House.’’ 200 The 
Committee stated that it was not ‘‘within 
the power of the President to conduct an in-
quiry into his own impeachment, to deter-
mine which evidence, and what version or 
portion of that evidence, is relevant and nec-
essary to such an inquiry. These are matters 
which, under the Constitution, the House has 
the sole power to determine.’’ 201 In the face 
of Congress’s investigation and the mounting 
evidence of his misdeeds, President Nixon re-
signed before the House had the chance to 
impeach him for this misconduct. 
B. President Trump’s Obstruction of the Im-
peachment Inquiry Violates Fundamental 
Constitutional Principles 
The 
Senate 
should 
convict 
President 
Trump of Obstruction of Congress as charged 
in the Second Article of Impeachment. Presi-
dent 
Trump 
unilaterally 
declared 
the 
House’s 
investigation 
‘‘illegitimate.’’ 202 
President Trump’s White House Counsel no-
tified the House that ‘‘President Trump can-
not permit his Administration to participate 
in this partisan inquiry under these cir-
cumstances.’’ 203 President Trump then di-
rected his Administration categorically to 
withhold documents and testimony from the 
House. 
The facts are undisputed. As charged in the 
Second Article of Impeachment, President 
Trump ‘‘[d]irect[ed] the White House to defy 
a lawful subpoena by withholding the pro-
duction of documents’’ to the Committees; 
‘‘[d]irect[ed] other Executive Branch agen-
cies and offices to defy lawful subpoenas and 
withhold the production of documents and 
records 
from 
the 
Committees’’; 
and 
‘‘[d]irected current and former Executive 
Branch officials not to cooperate with the 
Committees.’’ 204
In response to President 
Trump’s directives, OMB, the Department of 
State, Department of Energy, and Depart-
ment of Defense refused to produce any docu-
ments to the House, even though witness tes-
timony has revealed that additional highly 
relevant records exist.205 To date, the House 
Committees have not received a single docu-
ment or record from these departments and 
agencies pursuant to subpoenas, which re-
main in effect. 
President 
Trump 
personally 
demanded 
that his top aides refuse to testify in re-
sponse to subpoenas, and nine Administra-
tion officials followed his directive and con-
tinue to defy subpoenas for testimony.206 For 
example, when the Intelligence Committee 
issued a subpoena for Mick Mulvaney’s testi-
mony, he produced a November 8 letter from 
the White House stating: ‘‘the President di-
rects Mr. Mulvaney not to appear at the 
Committee’s scheduled deposition on Novem-
ber 8, 2019.’’ 207 When President Trump was 
unable to silence witnesses, he resorted to 
tactics to penalize and intimidate them. 
These efforts include President Trump’s sus-
tained attacks on the anonymous whistle-
blower, and his public statements designed 
to discourage witnesses from coming forward 
and to embarrass those who did testify.208 
Refusing to comply with a Congressional 
impeachment investigation is not a constitu-
tionally valid decision for a President to 
make. 
President 
Trump’s 
unprecedented 
‘‘complete defiance of an impeachment in-
quiry . . . served to cover up the President’s 
own repeated misconduct and to seize and 
control the power of impeachment.’’ 209 Presi-
dent Trump’s directive rejects one of the key 
features distinguishing our Republic from a 
monarchy: that ‘‘[t]he President of the 
United States [is] liable to be impeached, 
tried, and, upon conviction . . . removed.’’ 210 
Allowing President Trump to avoid convic-
tion on the Second Article would set a dan-
gerous precedent for future Presidents to 
hide their misconduct from Congressional 
scrutiny during an impeachment inquiry 
without fear of accountability. 
Notwithstanding President Trump’s ob-
struction, the House obtained compelling 
evidence that he abused his power. The fail-
ure of President Trump’s obstruction and at-
tempted cover-up, however, does not excuse 
his misconduct. There can be no doubt that 
the 
withheld 
documents 
and 
testimony 
would provide Congress with highly perti-
nent information about the President’s cor-
rupt scheme. Indeed, witnesses have testified 
about specific withheld records concerning 
President Trump’s July 25 call with Presi-
dent Zelensky and related materials,211 and 
public reports have referred to additional re-
sponsive documents, including ‘‘hundreds of 
documents that reveal extensive efforts to 
generate an after-the-fact justification for’’ 
withholding the security aid.212 
C. President Trump’s Excuses for His 
Obstruction Are Meritless 
President 
Trump 
has 
offered 
various 
unpersuasive excuses for his blanket refusal 
to comply with the House’s impeachment in-
quiry. President Trump’s refusal to provide 
information is not a principled assertion of 
executive privilege, but rather is a trans-
parent attempt to cover-up wrongdoing and 
amass power that the Constitution does not 
give him, including the power to decide 
whether and when Congress can hold him ac-
countable. 
First, while Congressional investigators 
often accommodate legitimate Executive 
Branch interests, the President’s blanket di-
rective to all Executive Branch agencies and 
witnesses to defy Congressional subpoenas 
was not based on any actual assertion of ex-
ecutive privilege or identification of par-
ticular sensitive information.213 The White 
House Counsel’s letter alluded to ‘‘long-es-
tablished Executive Branch confidentiality 
interests and privileges’’ that the State De-
partment could theoretically invoke,214 and 
the Justice Department’s Office of Legal 
Counsel preemptively dismissed certain sub-
poenas as ‘‘invalid’’ on the ground that re-
sponsive information was ‘‘potentially pro-
tected by executive privilege.’’ 215 But nei-
ther document conveyed an actual assertion 
of executive privilege,216
which would re-
quire, at a minimum, identification by the 
President of particular communications or 
documents containing protected material.217 
The White House cannot justify a blanket re-
fusal to respond to Congressional subpoenas 
based on an executive or other privilege it 
never in fact invoked. 
Regardless, executive privilege is inappli-
cable here, both because it may not be used

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S297 
January 21, 2020 
to conceal wrongdoing—particularly in an 
impeachment 
inquiry—and 
because 
the 
President and his agents have already dimin-
ished any confidentiality interests by speak-
ing at length about these events in every 
forum except Congress.218 President Trump 
has been impeached for Obstruction of Con-
gress not based upon discrete invocations of 
privilege or immunity, but for his directive 
that the Executive Branch categorically 
stonewall the House impeachment inquiry by 
refusing to comply with all subpoenas.219 
To the extent President Trump claims that 
he has concealed evidence to protect the Of-
fice of the President, the Framers considered 
and rejected that defense. Several delegates 
at the Constitutional Convention warned 
that the impeachment power would be ‘‘de-
structive 
of 
[the 
executive’s] 
independ-
ence.’’ 220 But the Framers adopted an im-
peachment power anyway because, as Alex-
ander Hamilton observed, ‘‘the powers relat-
ing to impeachments’’ are ‘‘an essential 
check in the hands of [Congress] upon the en-
croachments of the executive.’’ 221 The im-
peachment power does not exist to protect 
the Presidency; it exists to protect the na-
tion from a corrupt and dangerous President 
like Donald Trump. 
Second, President Trump has no basis for 
objecting to how the House conducted its im-
peachment proceedings. The Constitution 
vests the House with the ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment’’ 222 and the power to ‘‘determine 
the Rules of its Proceedings.’’ 223 
The rights that President Trump has de-
manded have never been recognized and have 
not been afforded in any prior Presidential 
impeachment.224 President Trump has been 
afforded protections equal to or greater than 
those afforded Presidents Nixon and Clinton 
during their impeachment proceedings in the 
House.225 Any claim that President Trump 
was entitled to due process rights modeled 
on a criminal trial during the entirety of the 
House impeachment inquiry ignores both law 
and history. A House impeachment inquiry 
cannot be compared to a criminal trial be-
cause the Senate, not the House, possesses 
the ‘‘sole Power to try Impeachments.’’ 226 
The Constitution does not entitle President 
Trump to a separate, full trial first in the 
House. 
Even indulging the analogy to a criminal 
trial, no person appearing before a pros-
ecutor or grand jury deciding whether to 
bring charges would have the rights Presi-
dent Trump has claimed. As the House Judi-
ciary Committee Chairman observed during 
Watergate, ‘‘it is not a right but a privilege 
or a courtesy’’ for the President to partici-
pate through counsel in House impeachment 
proceedings.227 President Trump’s demands 
are just another effort to obstruct the House 
in the exercise of its constitutional duty. 
Third, President Trump’s assertion that his 
impeachment for obstruction of Congress is 
invalid because the Committees did not first 
seek judicial enforcement of their subpoenas 
ignores again the Constitutional dictate that 
the House has sole authority to determine 
how to proceed with an impeachment. It also 
ignores President Trump’s own arguments to 
the federal courts. 
President Trump is telling one story to 
Congress while spinning a different tale in 
the courts. He is saying to Congress that the 
Committees should have sued the Executive 
Branch in court to enforce their subpoenas. 
But he has argued to that court that Con-
gressional Committees cannot sue the Execu-
tive Branch to enforce their subpoenas.228 
President Trump cannot tell Congress that it 
must pursue him in court, while simulta-
neously telling the courts that they are pow-
erless to enforce Congressional subpoenas. 
President Trump’s approach to the Judi-
cial Branch thus mirrors his obstruction of 
the Legislative Branch—in his view, neither 
can engage in any review of his conduct. 
This position conveys the President’s dan-
gerously misguided belief that no other 
branch of government may check his power 
or hold him accountable for abusing it.229 
That belief is fundamentally incompatible 
with our form of government. 
Months or years of litigation over each of 
the House’s subpoenas is in any event no an-
swer in this time-sensitive inquiry. The 
House’s subpoena to former White House 
Counsel Don McGahn was issued in April 
2019, but it is still winding its way through 
the courts over President Trump’s strong op-
position, even on an expedited schedule.230 
Litigating President Trump’s direction that 
each subpoena be denied would conflict with 
the House’s urgent duty to act on the com-
pelling evidence of impeachable misconduct 
that it has uncovered. Further delay could 
also compromise the integrity of the 2020 
election. 
When the Framers entrusted the House 
with the sole power of impeachment, they 
obviously meant to equip the House with the 
necessary tools to discover abuses of power 
by the President. Without that authority, 
the Impeachment Clause would fail as an ef-
fective safeguard against tyranny. A system 
in which the President cannot be charged 
with a crime, as the Department of Justice 
believes, and in which he can nullify the im-
peachment power through blanket obstruc-
tion, as President Trump has done here, is a 
system in which the President is above the 
law. The Senate should convict President 
Trump for his categorical obstruction of the 
House’s impeachment inquiry and ensure 
that this President, and any future Presi-
dent, cannot commit impeachable offenses 
and then avoid accountability by covering 
them up. 
III. The Senate Should Immediately Remove 
President Trump From Office to Prevent 
Further Abuses 
President Trump has demonstrated his 
continued willingness to corrupt free and 
fair elections, betray our national security, 
and subvert the constitutional separation of 
powers—all for personal gain. President 
Trump’s ongoing pattern of misconduct dem-
onstrates that he is an immediate threat to 
the Nation and the rule of law. It is impera-
tive that the Senate convict and remove him 
from office now, and permanently bar him 
from holding federal office. 
A. President Trump’s Repeated Abuse of 
Power Presents an Ongoing Threat to Our 
Elections 
President Trump’s solicitation of Ukrain-
ian interference in the 2020 election is not an 
isolated incident. It is part of his ongoing 
and deeply troubling course of misconduct 
that, as the First Article of Impeachment 
states, 
is 
‘‘consistent 
with 
President 
Trump’s previous invitations of foreign in-
terference in United States elections.’’ 231 
These previous efforts include inviting 
Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential 
election.232 As Special Counsel Mueller con-
cluded, the ‘‘Russian government interfered 
in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping 
and systematic fashion.’’ 233 Throughout the 
2016 election cycle, the Trump Campaign 
maintained significant contacts with agents 
of the Russian government who were offering 
damaging information concerning then-can-
didate Trump’s political opponent, and Mr. 
Trump repeatedly praised—and even publicly 
requested—the release of politically charged 
Russian-hacked emails.234 The Trump Cam-
paign welcomed Russia’s election inter-
ference because it ‘‘expected it would benefit 
electorally from information stolen and re-
leased through Russian efforts.’’ 235 
President Trump’s recent actions confirm 
that public censure is insufficient to deter 
him from continuing to facilitate foreign in-
terference in U.S. elections. In June 2019, 
President Trump declared that he sees 
‘‘nothing wrong with listening’’ to a foreign 
power that offers information detrimental to 
a political adversary. In the President’s 
words: ‘‘I think I’d take it.’’ 236 Asked wheth-
er such information should be reported to 
law enforcement, President Trump retorted: 
‘‘Give me a break, life doesn’t work that 
way.’’ 237 
Only one day after Special Counsel Mueller 
testified to Congress that the Trump Cam-
paign welcomed and sought to capitalize on 
Russia’s efforts to damage the President’s 
political rival in 2016, President Trump 
spoke to President Zelensky, pressuring 
Ukraine to announce investigations to dam-
age President Trump’s political opponent in 
the 2020 election and undermine Special 
Counsel 
Mueller’s 
findings.238
President 
Trump still embraces that call as both ‘‘rou-
tine’’ and ‘‘perfect.’’ 239 President Trump’s 
conduct would have horrified the Framers of 
our republic. 
In its findings, the Intelligence Committee 
emphasized the ‘‘proximate threat of further 
presidential attempts to solicit foreign in-
terference in our next election.’’ 240
That 
threat has not abated. In a sign that Presi-
dent Trump’s corrupt efforts to encourage 
interference in the 2020 election persist, he 
reiterated his desire for Ukraine to inves-
tigate his political opponents even after the 
scheme was discovered and the impeachment 
inquiry was announced. When asked in Octo-
ber 2019 what he hoped President Zelensky 
would do about ‘‘the Bidens,’’ President 
Trump answered that it was ‘‘very simple’’ 
and he hoped Ukraine would ‘‘start a major 
investigation.’’ 241 Unsolicited, he added that 
‘‘China should [likewise] start an investiga-
tion into the Bidens.’’ 242 
President Trump has also continued to en-
gage Mr. Giuliani to pursue the sham inves-
tigations on his behalf.243
One day after 
President 
Trump 
was 
impeached, 
Mr. 
Giuliani claimed that he gathered deroga-
tory evidence against Vice President Biden 
during a fact-finding trip to Ukraine—a trip 
where he met with a current Ukrainian offi-
cial who attended a KGB school in Moscow 
and has led calls in Ukraine to investigate 
Burisma and the Bidens.244 During the trip, 
Mr. Giuliani tweeted: ‘‘The conversation 
about corruption in Ukraine was based on 
compelling evidence of criminal conduct by 
then VP Biden, in 2016, that has not been re-
solved and until it is will be a major obstacle 
to the US assisting Ukraine with its anti- 
corruption reforms.’’ 245 Not only was Mr. 
Giuliani perpetuating the false allegations 
against the former Vice President, but he 
was reiterating the threat that President 
Trump had used to pressure President 
Zelensky to announce the investigations: 
that U.S. assistance to Ukraine would be 
withheld until Ukraine pursued the sham in-
vestigations. Mr. Giuliani has stated that he 
and the President continue to be ‘‘on the 
same page.’’ 246 Ukraine, as well, understands 
that 
Mr. 
Giuliani 
represents 
President 
Trump’s interests.247 
President Trump’s unrepentant embrace of 
foreign election interference illustrates the 
threat posed by his continued occupancy of 
the Office of the President. It also refutes 
the assertion that the consequences of his 
misconduct should be decided by the voters 
in the 2020 election. The aim of President 
Trump’s Ukraine scheme was to corrupt the 
integrity of the 2020 election by enlisting a 
foreign power to give him an unfair advan-
tage—in short, to cheat. That threat persists 
today.

gress Threatens Our Constitutional Order

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S298 
January 21, 2020 
hold him accountable for his misconduct pre-
sents a serious danger to our constitutional 
checks and balances. 
President Trump has made clear that he 
refuses to accept Congress’s express—and ex-
clusive—constitutional role in conducting 
impeachments.248 He has thereby subverted 
the Constitution that he pledged to uphold 
when he was inaugurated on the steps of the 
Capitol. By his words and deeds, President 
Trump has obstructed the House’s impeach-
ment inquiry at every turn: He has dismissed 
impeachment as ‘‘illegal, invalid, and uncon-
stitutional’’; 249
directed 
the 
Executive 
Branch not to comply with House subpoenas 
for documents and testimony; 250 and intimi-
dated and threatened the anonymous intel-
ligence community whistleblower as well as 
the patriotic public servants who honored 
their subpoenas and testified before the 
House.251 
President Trump’s obstruction is part of 
an ominous pattern of efforts ‘‘to undermine 
United States Government investigations 
into foreign interference in United States 
elections.’’ 252
Rather than assist Special 
Counsel Mueller’s investigation into Russian 
interference in the 2016 election and his own 
campaign’s exploitation of that foreign as-
sistance, President Trump repeatedly used 
the powers of his office to impede it. Among 
other actions, President Trump directed the 
White House Counsel to fire the Special 
Counsel and then create a false record of the 
firing, tampered with witnesses in the Spe-
cial Counsel’s investigation, and repeatedly 
and publicly attacked the legitimacy of the 
investigation.253
President Trump has in-
structed the former White House Counsel to 
defy a House Committee’s subpoena for testi-
mony concerning these matters and the De-
partment of Justice has argued that the 
courts cannot even hear the Committee’s ac-
tion to enforce its subpoena.254 
President Trump’s current obstruction of 
Congress is, therefore, not the first time he 
has committed misconduct concerning a fed-
eral investigation into election interference 
and then sought to hide it. Allowing this pat-
tern to continue without repercussion would 
send the clear message that President Trump 
is correct in his view that no governmental 
body can hold him accountable for wrong-
doing. That view is erroneous and exception-
ally dangerous. 
C. The Senate Should Convict and Remove 
President Trump to Protect Our System of 
Government and National Security Inter-
ests 
The Senate should convict and remove 
President Trump to avoid serious and long- 
term damage to our democratic values and 
the Nation’s security. 
If the Senate permits President Trump to 
remain in office, he and future leaders would 
be emboldened to welcome, and even enlist, 
foreign interference in elections for years to 
come. When the American people’s faith in 
their electoral process is shaken and its re-
sults called into question, the essence of 
democratic self-government is called into 
doubt. 
Failure to remove President Trump would 
signal that a President’s personal interests 
may take precedence over those of the Na-
tion, alarming our allies and emboldening 
our adversaries. Our leadership depends on 
the power of our example and the consist-
ency of our purpose,’’ but because of Presi-
dent Trump’s actions, ‘‘[b]oth have now been 
opened to question.’’ 255 
Ratifying 
President 
Trump’s 
behavior 
would likewise erode longstanding U.S. anti- 
corruption policy, which encourages coun-
tries to refrain from using the criminal jus-
tice system to investigate political oppo-
nents. As many witnesses explained, urging 
Ukraine to engage in ‘‘selective politically 
associated investigations or prosecutions’’ 
undermines the power of America’s example 
and our longstanding efforts to promote the 
rule of law abroad.256 
An acquittal would also provide license to 
President Trump and his successors to use 
taxpayer dollars for personal political ends. 
Foreign aid is not the only vulnerable source 
of funding; Presidents could also hold hos-
tage federal funds earmarked for States— 
such as money for natural disasters, high-
ways, and healthcare—unless and until State 
officials perform personal political favors. 
Any Congressional appropriation would be 
an opportunity for a President to solicit a 
favor for his personal political purposes—or 
for others to seek to curry favor with him. 
Such an outcome would be entirely incom-
patible with our constitutional system of 
self-government. 
President Trump has betrayed the Amer-
ican people and the ideals on which the Na-
tion was founded. Unless he is removed from 
office, he will continue to endanger our na-
tional security, jeopardize the integrity of 
our elections, and undermine our core con-
stitutional principles.

In re Impeachment of President Donald J. 
Trump 
STATEMENT
OF
MATERIAL
FACTS—ATTACH-
MENT TO THE TRIAL MEMORANDUM OF THE 
UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT 
DONALD J. TRUMP 
INTRODUCTION 
The U.S. House of Representatives has 
adopted Articles of Impeachment charging 
President Donald J. Trump with abuse of of-
fice and obstruction of Congress. The House’s 
Trial Memorandum explains why the Senate 
should convict and remove President Trump 
from office, and permanently bar him from 
government service. The Memorandum relies 
on this Statement of Material Facts, which 
summarizes key evidence relating to the 
President’s misconduct. 
As further described below, and as detailed 
in House Committee reports,1
President 
Trump used the powers of his office and U.S. 
taxpayers’ money to pressure a foreign coun-
try, Ukraine, to interfere in the 2020 U.S. 
Presidential election on his behalf. President 
Trump’s goals—which became known to mul-
tiple U.S. officials who testified before the 
House—were simple and starkly political: he 
wanted Ukraine’s new President to announce 
investigations that would assist his 2020 re-
election campaign and tarnish a political op-
ponent, former Vice President Joseph Biden, 
Jr. As leverage, President Trump illegally 
withheld from Ukraine nearly $400 million in 
vital military and other security assistance 
that had been appropriated by Congress, and 
an official White House meeting that Presi-
dent 
Trump 
had 
promised 
Volodymyr 
Zelensky, the newly elected President of 
Ukraine. President Trump did this despite 
U.S. national security officials’ unanimous 
opposition to withholding the aid from 
Ukraine, placing his own personal and polit-
ical interests above the national security in-
terests of the United States and undermining 
the integrity of our democracy. 
When this scheme became known and Com-
mittees of the House launched an investiga-
tion, the President, for the first time in 
American history, ordered the categorical 
obstruction of an impeachment inquiry. 
President Trump directed that no witnesses 
should testify and no documents should be 
produced to the House, a co-equal branch of 
government endowed by the Constitution 
with the ‘‘sole Power of Impeachment.’’ 2 
President Trump’s conduct—both in solic-
iting a foreign country’s interference in a 
U.S. election and then obstructing the ensu-
ing investigation into that interference—was 
consistent with his prior conduct during and 
after the 2016 election. 
STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS 
I. President Trump’s Abuse of Power 
A. The President’s Scheme To Solicit For-
eign Interference in the 2020 Election From 
the New Ukrainian Government Began in 
Spring 2019 
1. On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky, a 
political neophyte, won a landslide victory 
in Ukraine’s Presidential election.3 Zelensky 
campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, 
and his victory reaffirmed the Ukrainian 
people’s strong desire for reform.4 
2. When President Trump called to con-
gratulate Zelensky later that day, President 
Trump did not raise any concerns about cor-
ruption in Ukraine, although his staff had 
prepared written materials for him recom-
mending that he do so, and the White House 
call readout incorrectly indicated he did.5 
3. During the call, President Trump prom-
ised President-elect Zelensky that a high- 
level U.S. delegation would attend his inau-
guration and told him, ‘‘When you’re settled 
in and ready, I’d like to invite you to the 
White House.’’ 6 
4. Both events would have demonstrated 
strong support by the United States as 
Ukraine fought a war—and negotiated for 
peace—with Russia. ‘‘Russia was watching 
closely to gauge the level of American sup-
port for the Ukrainian Government.’’ 7
A 
White House visit also would have bolstered 
Zelensky’s standing at home as he pursued 
his anti-corruption agenda.8 
5. Following the April 21 call, President 
Trump asked Vice President Mike Pence to 
lead the American delegation to President 
Zelensky’s inauguration. During his own call 
with President-elect Zelensky on April 23, 
Vice President Pence confirmed that he 
would attend the inauguration ‘‘if the dates 
worked out.’’ 9 
6. On April 23, the media reported that 
former Vice President Biden was going to 
enter the 2020 race for the Democratic nomi-
nation for President of the United States.10 
7. The next day, April 24, the State Depart-
ment executed President Trump’s order to 
recall the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie 
‘‘Masha’’ Yovanovitch, who was a well-re-
garded career diplomat and champion for 
anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine.11 
8. The removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch 
was the culmination of a months-long smear 
campaign waged by the President’s personal 
lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and other allies of 
the President.12 The President also helped 
amplify the smear campaign.13 
9. Upon her return to the United States, 
Ambassador Yovanovitch was informed by 
State Department officials that there was no 
substantive reason or cause for her removal, 
but that President Trump had simply ‘‘lost 
confidence’’ in her.14 
10. Mr. Giuliani later disclosed the true 
motive for Ambassador Yovanovitch’s re-
moval: Mr. Giuliani ‘‘believed that [he] need-
ed Yovanovitch out of the way’’ because 
‘‘[s]he was going to make the investigations 
difficult for everybody.’’ 15 
11. Mr. Giuliani was referring to the two 
politically motivated investigations that 
President Trump solicited from Ukraine in 
order to assist his 2020 reelection campaign: 
one into former Vice President Biden and a 
Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, 
on whose board Biden’s son sat; 16 the other 
into a discredited conspiracy theory that 
Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 
2016 U.S. election to help Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign. One element of the latter con-
spiracy theory was that CrowdStrike—a 
NASDAQ-listed cybersecurity firm based in 
Sunnyvale, California, that the President er-
roneously believed was owned by a Ukrain-
ian oligarch—had colluded with the Demo-
cratic National Committee (DNC) to frame 
Russia and help the election campaign of 
Hillary Clinton.17 
12. There was no factual basis for either in-
vestigation. As to the first, witnesses unani-
mously testified that there was no credible 
evidence to support the allegations that, in 
late 2015, Vice President Biden corruptly en-
couraged Ukraine to remove then-Prosecutor 
General Viktor Shokin because he was inves-
tigating Burisma.18 Rather, Vice President 
Biden was carrying out official U.S. policy— 
with bipartisan support 19—and promoting 
anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine because 
Shokin was viewed by the United States, its 
European partners, and the International 
Monetary Fund to be ineffectual at pros-
ecuting corruption and was himself cor-
rupt.20 In fact, witnesses unanimously testi-
fied that the removal of Shokin made it more 
likely that Ukraine would investigate corrup-
tion, including Burisma and its owner, not 
less likely.21 The Ukrainian Parliament re-
moved Shokin in March 2016.22 
13. As to the second investigation, the U.S. 
Intelligence Community determined that 
Russia—not Ukraine—interfered in the 2016 
election.23 The Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence reached the same conclusion fol-
lowing its own lengthy bipartisan investiga-
tion.24 Special Counsel Robert Mueller, III, 
likewise concluded that the ‘‘Russian gov-
ernment interfered in the 2016 presidential 
election in sweeping and systematic fash-
ion.’’ 25 And FBI Director Christopher Wray, 
a Trump appointee, recently confirmed that 
law enforcement ‘‘ha[s] no information that 
indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 
2016 presidential election.’’ 26 
14. As Dr. Fiona Hill—who served until 
July 2019 as the Senior Director of European 
and Russian Affairs at the National Security 
Council (NSC) under President Trump until 
July 2019—testified, the theory of Ukrainian 
interference in the 2016 election is a ‘‘fic-
tional narrative that is being perpetrated 
and propagated by the Russian security serv-
ices themselves’’ to deflect from Russia’s 
own culpability and to drive a wedge be-
tween the United States and Ukraine.27 In 
fact, shortly after the 2016 U.S. election, this 
conspiracy theory was promoted by none 
other than President Vladimir Putin him-
self.28 On May 3, 2019, shortly after President 
Zelensky’s election, President Trump and 
President Putin spoke by telephone, includ-
ing about the so-called ‘‘Russian Hoax.’’ 29 
15. President Trump’s senior advisors had 
attempted to dissuade the President from 
promoting this conspiracy theory, to no 
avail. Dr. Hill testified that President 
Trump’s former Homeland Security Advisor 
Tom Bossert and former National Security 
Advisor H.R. McMaster ‘‘spent a lot of time 
trying to refute this [theory] in the first 
year of the administration.’’ 30 Bossert later 
said the false narrative about Ukrainian in-
terference in the 2016 election was ‘‘not only 
a conspiracy theory, it is completely de-
bunked.’’ 31 
B. The President Enlisted His Personal At-
torney and U.S. Officials To Help Execute 
the Scheme for His Personal Benefit 
16. Shortly after his April 21 call with 
President Zelensky, President Trump began 
to publicly press for the two investigations 
he wanted Ukraine to pursue. On April 25— 
the day that former Vice President Biden an-
nounced his candidacy for the Democratic 
nomination for President—President Trump 
called into Sean Hannity’s prime time Fox 
News show. Referencing alleged Ukrainian 
interference in the 2016 election, President 
Trump said, ‘‘It sounds like big stuff,’’ and 
suggested that the Attorney General might 
investigate.32

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S301 
January 21, 2020 
17. On May 6, in a separate Fox News inter-
view, President Trump claimed Vice Presi-
dent Biden’s advocacy for Mr. Shokin’s dis-
missal in 2016 was ‘‘a very serious problem’’ 
and ‘‘a major scandal, major problem.’’ 33 
18. On May 9, the New York Times reported 
that Mr. Giuliani was planning to travel to 
Ukraine to urge President Zelensky to pur-
sue the investigations.34
Mr. Giuliani ac-
knowledged that ‘‘[s]omebody could say it’s 
improper’’ to pressure Ukraine to open inves-
tigations 
that 
would 
benefit 
President 
Trump, but he argued: 
[T]his isn’t foreign policy—I’m asking 
them to do an investigation that they’re 
doing already, and that other people are tell-
ing them to stop. And I’m going to give them 
reasons why they shouldn’t stop it because 
that information will be very, very helpful to 
my client, and may turn out to be helpful to 
my government.35 
Ukraine was not, in fact, ‘‘already’’ con-
ducting these investigations. As described 
below, the Trump Administration repeatedly 
tried but failed to get Ukrainian officials to 
instigate these investigations. According to 
Mr. Giuliani, the President supported his ac-
tions, stating that President Trump ‘‘basi-
cally knows what I’m doing, sure, as his law-
yer.’’ 36 
19. IN a letter dated May 10, 2019, and ad-
dressed to President-elect Zelensky, Mr. 
Giuliani wrote that he ‘‘represent[ed] him 
[President Trump] as a private citizen, not 
as President of the United States.’’ In his ca-
pacity as ‘‘personal counsel to President 
Trump, and with his knowledge and con-
sent,’’ Mr. Giuliani requested a meeting with 
President Zelensky the following week to 
discuss a ‘‘specific request.’’ 37 
20. On the evening of Friday, May 10, how-
ever, Mr. Giuliani announced that he was 
canceling his trip.38 He later explained, ‘‘I’m 
not going to go’’ to Ukraine ‘‘because I’m 
walking into a group of people that are en-
emies of the President.’’ 39 
21. By the following Monday morning, May 
13, President Trump had ordered Vice Presi-
dent 
Pence 
not 
to 
attend 
President 
Zelensky’s inauguration in favor of a lower- 
ranking delegation led by Secretary of En-
ergy Rick Perry.40 
22. The U.S. delegation—which also in-
cluded Ambassador to the European Union 
Gordon Sondland, Special Representative for 
Ukraine 
Negotiations 
Ambassador 
Kurt 
Volker, and NSC Director for Ukraine Lieu-
tenant 
Colonel 
Alexander 
Vindman—re-
turned from the inauguration convinced that 
President Zelensky was genuinely com-
mitted to anti-corruption reforms.41 
23. At a meeting in the Oval Office on May 
23, members of the delegation relayed their 
positive impressions to President Trump and 
encouraged him to schedule the promised 
Oval Office meeting for President Zelensky. 
President Trump, however, said he ‘‘didn’t 
believe’’ the delegation’s positive assess-
ment, claiming ‘‘that’s not what I hear’’ 
from Mr. Giuliani.42 The President cast his 
dim view of Ukraine in personal terms, stat-
ing that Ukraine ‘‘tried to take me down’’ 
during the 2016 election—an apparent ref-
erence to the debunked conspiracy theory 
that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election 
to help Hillary Clinton and harm his cam-
paign.43 
24. Rather than commit to a date for an 
Oval 
Office 
meeting 
with 
President 
Zelensky, President Trump directed the del-
egation to ‘‘[t]alk to Rudy, talk to Rudy.’’ 44 
Ambassador Sondland testified that ‘‘if [the 
delegation] never called Rudy and just left it 
alone nothing would happen with Ukraine,’’ 
and ‘‘if [the President] was going to have his 
mind changed, that was the path.’’ 45 Fol-
lowing the May 23 meeting, Secretary Perry 
and Ambassadors Sondland and Volker began 
to coordinate and work with Mr. Giuliani to 
satisfy the President’s demands.46 
25. Mr. Giuliani is not a U.S. government 
official and has never served in the Trump 
Administration. Rather, as he has repeatedly 
made clear, his goal was to obtain ‘‘informa-
tion [that] will be very, very helpful to my 
client’’—President Trump.47
Mr. Giuliani 
made clear to Ambassadors Sondland and 
Volker, who were in direct communications 
with Ukrainian officials, that a White House 
meeting would not occur until Ukraine an-
nounced its pursuit of the two political in-
vestigations.48 
26. On June 17, Ambassador Bill Taylor, 
whom Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had 
asked to replace Ambassador Yovanovitch, 
arrived in Kyiv as the new Charge´
d’Af-
faires.49 
27. Ambassador Taylor quickly observed 
that there was an ‘‘irregular channel’’ led by 
Mr. Giuliani that, over time, began to under-
mine the official channel of U.S. diplomatic 
relations 
with 
Ukraine.50
Ambassador 
Sondland similarly testified that the agenda 
described by Mr. Giuliani became more ‘‘in-
sidious’’ over time.51
Mr. Giuliani would 
prove to be, as the President’s National Se-
curity Advisor Ambassador John Bolton told 
a colleague, a ‘‘hand grenade that was going 
to blow everyone up.’’ 52 
C. The President Froze Vital Military and 
Other Security Assistance for Ukraine 
28. Since 2014, Ukraine has been engaged in 
an ongoing armed conflict with Russia in the 
Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.53 Ukraine 
is a ‘‘strategic partner of the United States,’’ 
and the United States has long supported 
Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.54 As Am-
bassador Volker and multiple other wit-
nesses testified, supporting Ukraine is ‘‘criti-
cally important’’ to U.S. interests, including 
countering Russian aggression in the re-
gion.55 
29. Ukrainians face casualties on a near- 
daily basis in their ongoing conflict with 
Russia.56 Since 2014, Russian aggression has 
resulted in more than 13,000 Ukrainian 
deaths on Ukrainian territory,57 including 
approximately 
3,331 
civilians, 
and 
has 
wounded another 30,000 persons.58 
30. Since 2014, following Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine and its annexation of the Cri-
mean Peninsula, Congress has allocated 
military and other security assistance funds 
to Ukraine on a broad bipartisan basis.59 
Since 2014, the United States has provided 
approximately $3.1 billion in foreign assist-
ance to Ukraine: $1.5 billion in military and 
other security assistance, and $1.6 billion in 
non-military, 
non-humanitarian 
aid 
to 
Ukraine.60 
31. The military assistance provided by the 
United States to Ukraine ‘‘saves lives’’ by 
making Ukrainian resistance to Russia more 
effective.61
It likewise advances U.S. na-
tional security interests because, ‘‘[i]f Rus-
sia prevails and Ukraine falls to Russian do-
minion, we can expect to see other attempts 
by Russia to expand its territory and influ-
ence.’’ 62 Indeed, the reason the United States 
provides assistance to the Ukrainian mili-
tary is ‘‘so that they can fight Russia over 
there, and we don’t have to fight Russia 
here.’’ 63 
32. The United States’ European allies have 
similarly provided political and economic 
support to Ukraine. Since 2014, the European 
Union (EU) has been the largest donor to 
Ukraine.64 The EU has extended more macro- 
financial assistance to Ukraine—approxi-
mately Ö3.3 billion—than to any other non- 
EU country and has committed to extend an-
other Ö1.1 billion.65 Between 2014 and Sep-
tember 30, 2019, the EU and the European fi-
nancial institutions (including the European 
Investment Bank, European Bank for Recon-
struction and Development, and others) com-
mitted over 15 billion in grants and loans to 
support the reform process in Ukraine.66 Ac-
cording to EU data, Germany contributed 
Ö786.5 million to Ukraine between 2014 and 
2017; the United Kingdom contributed Ö105.6 
million; and France contributed Ö61.9 million 
over that same period (not including the 
amounts these countries contribute through 
the EU).67 
33. In 2017 and 2018, the United States pro-
vided approximately $511 million and $359 
million, respectively, in foreign assistance to 
Ukraine, including military and other secu-
rity assistance.68 During those two years, 
President Trump and his Administration al-
lowed 
the 
funds 
to 
flow 
to 
Ukraine 
unimpeded.69 
34. For fiscal year 2019, Congress appro-
priated and authorized $391 million in tax-
payer-funded security assistance to Ukraine: 
$250 million in funds administered by the De-
partment of Defense (DOD) and $115 million 
in funds administered by the State Depart-
ment, with another $26 million carried over 
from fiscal year 2018.70 
35. DOD planned to use the funds to provide 
Ukraine with sniper rifles, rocket-propelled 
grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, 
electronic warfare detection and secure com-
munications, and night vision equipment, 
among other military equipment, to defend 
itself against Russian forces, which have oc-
cupied part of eastern Ukraine since 2014.71 
These purposes were consistent with the 
goals of Congress, which had appropriated 
the funds administered by DOD under the 
Ukraine 
Security 
Assistance 
Initiative 
(USAI) for the purpose of providing ‘‘train-
ing; equipment; lethal assistance; logistics 
support, supplies and services; sustainment; 
and intelligence support to the military and 
national security forces of Ukraine, and . . . 
replacement of any weapons or articles pro-
vided to the Government of Ukraine.’’ 72 
36. On June 18, 2019, after all Congression-
ally mandated conditions on the DOD-admin-
istered 
aid—including 
certification 
that 
Ukraine had adopted sufficient anti-corrup-
tion reforms—were met, DOD issued a press 
release announcing its intention to provide 
the $250 million in security assistance to 
Ukraine.73 
37. On June 19, the Office of Management 
and Budget 1(OMB) received questions from 
President Trump about the funding for 
Ukraine.74 OMB, in turn, made inquiries with 
DOD.75 
38. On June 27, Acting Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney reportedly emailed his senior advi-
sor Robert Blair, ‘‘Did we ever find out about 
the money for Ukraine and whether we can 
hold it back?’’ Mr. Blair responded that it 
would be possible, but they should ‘‘[e]xpect 
Congress to become unhinged’’ if the Presi-
dent held back the appropriated funds.76 
39. Around this time, despite overwhelming 
support for the security assistance from 
every relevant Executive Branch agency,77 
and despite the fact that the funds had been 
authorized and appropriated by Congress 
with strong bipartisan support,78 the Presi-
dent ordered a hold on all military and other 
security assistance for Ukraine.79 
40. By July 3, OMB had blocked the release 
of $141 million in State Department funds. 
By July 12, all military and other security 
assistance for Ukraine had been blocked.80 
41. On July 18, OMB announced to the rel-
evant Executive Branch agencies during a se-
cure videoconference that President Trump 
had ordered a hold on all Ukraine security 
assistance.81 No explanation for the hold was 
provided.82 
42. On July 25—approximately 90 minutes 
after President Trump spoke by phone with 
President Zelensky—OMB’s Associate Direc-
tor for National Security Programs, Michael

January 21, 2020 
Duffey, a political appointee, instructed DOD 
officials: ‘‘Based on guidance I have received 
and in light of the Administration’s plan to 
review assistance to Ukraine, including the 
Ukraine 
Security 
Assistance 
Initiative, 
please hold off on any additional DoD obliga-
tions of these funds, pending direction from 
that process.’’ 83 He added: ‘‘Given the sen-
sitive nature of the request, I appreciate 
your keeping that information closely held 
to those who need to know to execute the di-
rection.’’ 84 
43. In late July, the NSC convened a series 
of interagency meetings during which senior 
Executive Branch officials discussed the hold 
on security assistance.85 Over the course of 
these meetings, a number of facts became 
clear: (1) the President personally directed 
the hold through OMB; 86 (2) no credible jus-
tification was provided for the hold; 87 (3) 
with the exception of OMB, all relevant 
agencies supported the Ukraine security as-
sistance because, among other things, it was 
in the national security interests of the 
United States; 88 and (4) there were serious 
concerns about the legality of the hold.89 
44. 
Although 
President 
Trump 
later 
claimed that the hold was part of an effort to 
get European allies to share more of the 
costs for security assistance for Ukraine, of-
ficials responsible for the security assistance 
testified they had not heard that rationale 
discussed in June, July, or August. For ex-
ample, Mark Sandy, OMB’s Deputy Associate 
Director for National Security Programs, 
who is responsible for DOD’s portion of the 
Ukraine security assistance, testified that 
the European burden-sharing explanation 
was first provided to him in September—fol-
lowing his repeated requests to learn the rea-
son for the hold.90 Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense Laura Cooper, whose re-
sponsibilities include the Ukraine security 
assistance, testified that she had ‘‘no recol-
lection of the issue of allied burden sharing 
coming up’’ in the three meetings she at-
tended about the freeze on security assist-
ance, nor did she recall hearing about a lack 
of funding from Ukraine’s allies as a reason 
for the freeze.91 Ms. Cooper further testified 
that there was no policy or interagency re-
view process relating to the Ukraine security 
assistance that she ‘‘participated in or knew 
of’’ in August 2019.92 In addition, while the 
aid 
was 
being 
withheld, 
Ambassador 
Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the EU, 
was never asked to reach out to the EU or its 
member states to ask them to increase their 
contributions to Ukraine.93 
45. Two OMB career officials, including one 
of its legal counsel, ultimately resigned, in 
part, over concerns about the handling of the 
hold on security assistance.94 A confidential 
White House review has reportedly ‘‘turned 
up hundreds of documents that reveal exten-
sive efforts to generate an after-the-fact jus-
tification’’ for the hold.95 
46. Throughout August, officials from DOD 
warned officials from OMB that, as the hold 
continued, there was an increasing risk that 
the funds for Ukraine would not be timely 
obligated, in violation of the Impoundment 
Control Act of 1974.96 On January 16, 2020, the 
U.S. 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
(GAO) concluded that OMB had, in fact, vio-
lated the Impoundment Control Act when it 
withheld from obligation funds appropriated 
by Congress to DOD for security assistance 
to Ukraine. GAO stated that ‘‘[f]aithful exe-
cution of the law does not permit the Presi-
dent to substitute his own policy priorities 
for those that Congress has enacted into 
law.’’ 97 
47. In late August, Secretary of Defense 
Mike Esper, Secretary of State Pompeo, and 
National Security Advisor Bolton reportedly 
urged the President to release the aid to 
Ukraine, advising the President that the aid 
was in America’s national security inter-
est.98 On August 30, however, an OMB official 
advised a Pentagon official by email that 
there was a ‘‘clear direction from POTUS to 
continue to hold.’’ 99 
48. Contrary to U.S. national security in-
terests—and over the objections of his own 
advisors—President 
Trump 
continued 
to 
withhold the funding to Ukraine through Au-
gust and into September, without any cred-
ible explanation.100 
D. President Trump Conditioned a White 
House Meeting on Ukraine Announcing It 
Would Launch Politically Motivated Inves-
tigations 
49. Upon his arrival in Kyiv in June 2019, 
Ambassador Taylor sought to schedule the 
promised White House meeting for President 
Zelensky, which was ‘‘an agreed-upon goal’’ 
of policymakers in Ukraine and the United 
States.101 
50. As Ambassador Volker explained, a 
White House visit by President Zelensky 
would constitute ‘‘a tremendous symbol of 
support’’ for Ukraine and would ‘‘enhance[] 
[President Zelensky’s] stature.’’ 102 
51. Ambassador Taylor learned, however, 
that President Trump ‘‘wanted to hear from 
Zelensky,’’ who had to ‘‘make clear’’ to 
President Trump that he was not ‘‘standing 
in the way of investigations.’ ’’ 103 It soon be-
came clear to Ambassador Taylor and others 
that the White House meeting would not be 
scheduled until the Ukraine committed to 
the investigations of ‘‘Burisma and alleged 
Ukrainian influence in the 2016 elections.’’ 104 
52. Ambassador Sondland was unequivocal 
in describing this conditionality. He testi-
fied: 
I know that members of this committee 
frequently frame these complicated issues in 
the form of a simple question: Was there a 
quid pro quo? As I testified previously with 
regard to the requested White House call and 
the White House meeting, the answer is 
yes.105 
53. According to Ambassador Sondland, the 
public announcement of the investigations— 
and not necessarily the pursuit of the inves-
tigations themselves—was the price Presi-
dent Trump sought in exchange for a White 
House meeting with Ukrainian President 
Zelensky.106 
54. Both Ambassadors Volker and Sondland 
explicitly communicated this quid pro quo to 
Ukrainian government officials. For exam-
ple, on July 2, in Toronto, Canada, Ambas-
sador Volker conveyed the message directly 
to President Zelensky and referred to the 
‘‘Giuliani factor’’ in President Zelensky’s en-
gagement with the United States.107 Ambas-
sador Volker told Ambassador Taylor that 
during the Toronto conference, he counseled 
President Zelensky about how he ‘‘could pre-
pare for the phone call with President 
Trump’’—specifically, that President Trump 
‘‘would like to hear about the investiga-
tions.’’ 108 
55. Ambassador Volker confirmed that, in 
‘‘a 
pull-aside’’ 
meeting 
in 
Toronto, 
he 
‘‘advise[d] [President Zelensky] that he 
should call President Trump personally be-
cause he needed to . . . be able to convey to 
President Trump that he was serious about 
fighting 
corruption, 
investigating 
things 
that happened in the past and so forth.’’ 109 
Upon hearing about this discussion, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State for European 
and Eurasian Affairs George Kent told Am-
bassador Volker that ‘‘asking for another 
country to investigate a prosecution for po-
litical reasons undermines our advocacy of 
the rule of law.’’ 110 
56. On July 10, at a meeting with Ukrainian 
officials in Ambassador Bolton’s office at the 
White House, Ambassador Sondland was even 
more explicit about the quid pro quo. He 
stated—in front of multiple witnesses, in-
cluding 
two 
top 
advisors 
to 
President 
Zelensky and Ambassador Bolton—that he 
had an arrangement with Mr. Mulvaney to 
schedule the White House visit after Ukraine 
initiated the ‘‘investigations.’’ 111 
57. In a second meeting in the White House 
Ward Room shortly thereafter, ‘‘Ambassador 
Sondland, in front of the Ukrainians . . . was 
talking about how he had an agreement with 
Chief of Staff Mulvaney for a meeting with 
the Ukrainians if they were going to go for-
ward with investigations.’’ 112 More specifi-
cally, Lt. Col. Vindman testified that Am-
bassador Sondland said ‘‘[t]hat the Ukrain-
ians would have to deliver an investigation 
into the Bidens.’’ 113 
58. During that meeting, Dr. Hill and Lt. 
Col. 
Vindman 
objected 
to 
Ambassador 
Sondland intertwining what Dr. Hill later 
described as a ‘‘domestic political errand’’ 
with official national security policy toward 
Ukraine.114 
59. Following the July 10 meetings, Dr. Hill 
discussed what had occurred with Ambas-
sador 
Bolton, 
including 
Ambassador 
Sondland’s reiteration of the quid pro quo to 
the Ukrainians in the Ward Room. Ambas-
sador Bolton told her to ‘‘go and tell [the 
NSC Legal Advisor] that I am not part of 
whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney 
are cooking up on this.’’ 115 
60. Both Dr. Hill and Lt. Col. Vindman sep-
arately reported Sondland’s description of 
the quid pro quo during the July 10 meetings 
to NSC Legal Advisor, John Eisenberg, who 
said he would follow up.116 
61. After the July 10 meetings, Andriy 
Yermak, a top aide to President Zelensky 
who was in the meetings, followed up with 
Ambassador Volker by text message: ‘‘Thank 
you for meeting and your clear and very log-
ical position . . . I feel that the key for 
many things is Rudi [sic] and I [am] ready to 
talk with him at any time.’’ 117 
62. Over the next two weeks, Ambassadors 
Sondland and Volker coordinated with Mr. 
Giuliani and senior Ukrainian and American 
officials to arrange a telephone call between 
President Trump and President Zelensky. 
They also worked to ensure that, during that 
phone call, President Zelensky would con-
vince President Trump of his willingness to 
undertake the investigations in order to get 
the White House meeting scheduled.118 
63. On July 19, Ambassador Volker had 
breakfast with Mr. Giuliani at the Trump 
Hotel in Washington, D.C. After the meeting, 
Ambassador Volker reported back to Ambas-
sadors Sondland and Taylor about his con-
versation with Mr. Giuliani, stating, ‘‘Most 
impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help 
investigation—and address any specific per-
sonnel issues—if there are any.’’ 119 
64. The same day, Ambassador Sondland 
spoke with President Zelensky and rec-
ommended that the Ukrainian leader tell 
President Trump that he ‘‘will leave no 
stone unturned’’ regarding the investiga-
tions during the upcoming Presidential 
phone call.120 
65. Following his conversation with Presi-
dent 
Zelensky, 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
emailed top Trump Administration officials, 
including Secretary Pompeo, Mr. Mulvaney, 
and Secretary Perry. Ambassador Sondland 
stated that President Zelensky confirmed 
that he would ‘‘assure’’ President Trump 
that ‘‘he intends to run a fully transparent 
investigation and will turn over every 
stone.’ ’’ 121 
66. Secretary Perry responded to Ambas-
sador Sondland’s email, ‘‘Mick just con-
firmed the call being set up for tomorrow by 
NSC.’’ About an hour later, Mr. Mulvaney re-
plied, ‘‘I asked NSC to set it up for tomor-
row.’’ 122 
67. According to Ambassador Sondland,

top Trump Administration officials—showed 
that his efforts regarding Ukraine were not 
part of a rogue foreign policy. To the con-
trary, Ambassador Sondland testified that 
‘‘everyone was in the loop.’’ 123 
68. The Ukrainians also understood the 
quid pro quo—and the domestic U.S. political 
ramifications of the investigations they were 
being asked to pursue. On July 20, a close ad-
visor to President Zelensky warned Ambas-
sador Taylor that the Ukrainian leader ‘‘did 
not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. re-
election campaign.’’ 124 The next day, Ambas-
sador Taylor warned Ambassador Sondland 
that President Zelensky was ‘‘sensitive 
about Ukraine being taken seriously, not 
merely as an instrument in Washington do-
mestic, reelection politics.’’ 125 
69. Nevertheless, President Trump, directly 
and through his hand-picked representatives, 
continued to press the Ukrainian govern-
ment for the announcement of the investiga-
tions, including during President Trump’s 
July 25 call with President Zelensky.126 
E. President Trump Directly Solicited Elec-
tion Interference From President Zelensky 
70. In the days leading up to President 
Trump’s 
July 
25 
call 
with 
President 
Zelensky, U.S. polling data showed former 
Vice President Biden leading in a head-to- 
head contest against President Trump.127 
71. Meanwhile, Ambassadors Sondland and 
Volker 
continued 
to 
prepare 
President 
Zelensky and his advisors for the call with 
President Trump until right before it oc-
curred. 
72. On the morning of July 25, Ambassador 
Sondland spoke with President Trump in ad-
vance of his call with President Zelensky. 
Ambassador Sondland then called Ambas-
sador Volker and left a voicemail.128 
73. After receiving Ambassador Sondland’s 
message, Ambassador Volker sent a text 
message to President Zelensky’s aide, Mr. 
Yermak, approximately 30 minutes before 
the call: 
Heard from White House—assuming Presi-
dent Z convinces trump he will investigate/ 
‘‘get to the bottom of what happened’’ in 
2016, we will nail down date for visit to 
Washington. Good luck! 129 
74. In his public testimony, Ambassador 
Sondland 
confirmed 
that 
Ambassador 
Volker’s text message to Mr. Yermak accu-
rately summarized the directive he had re-
ceived from President Trump earlier that 
morning.130 
75. During the roughly 30–minute July 25 
call, President Zelensky thanked President 
Trump for the ‘‘great support in the area of 
defense’’ provided by the United States and 
stated that Ukraine would soon be prepared 
to purchase additional Javelin anti-tank 
missiles from the United States.131 
76. 
President 
Trump 
immediately 
re-
sponded with his own request: ‘‘I would like 
you to do us a favor though,’’ which was ‘‘to 
find 
out 
what 
happened’’ 
with 
alleged 
Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election 
and to ‘‘look into’’ former Vice President 
Biden’s role in encouraging the removal of 
the former Ukrainian prosecutor general. 
77. Referencing Special Counsel Mueller’s 
investigation into Russian interference in 
the 2016 election, President Trump told 
President Zelensky, ‘‘[T]hey say a lot of it 
started with Ukraine,’’ and ‘‘[w]hatever you 
can do, it’s very important that you do it if 
that’s possible.’’ 132 
78. President Trump repeatedly pressed the 
Ukrainian President to consult with his per-
sonal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani, as well as Attor-
ney General William Barr, about the two 
specific investigations.133 President Trump 
stated, ‘‘Rudy very much knows what’s hap-
pening and he is a very capable guy. If you 
could speak to him that would be great.’’ 134 
79. President Zelensky agreed, referencing 
Mr. Giuliani’s back-channel role, noting that 
Mr. Yermak ‘‘spoke with Mr. Giuliani just 
recently and we are hoping very much that 
Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine 
and 
we 
will 
meet 
once 
he 
comes 
to 
Ukraine.’’ 135 
80. Later in the call, President Zelensky 
heeded the directives he had received from 
Ambassadors 
Sondland 
and 
Volker: 
he 
thanked President Trump for his invitation 
to the White House and then reiterated that, 
‘‘[o]n the other hand,’’ he would ‘‘ensure’’ 
that Ukraine pursued ‘‘the investigation’’ 
that President Trump had requested. Presi-
dent Zelensky confirmed the investigations 
should be done ‘‘openly.’’ 136 
81. During the call, President Trump also 
attacked Ambassador Yovanovitch. He said, 
‘‘The former ambassador from the United 
States, the woman, was bad news and the 
people she was dealing with in the Ukraine 
were bad news so I just want to let you know 
that.’’ He later added, ‘‘Well, she’s going to 
go through some things.’’ President Trump 
also defended then-Ukrainian Prosecutor 
General Yuriy Lutsenko, who was widely 
known to be corrupt.137 
82. The President did not mention any 
other issues relating to Ukraine, including 
concerns about Ukrainian corruption, Presi-
dent Zelensky’s anti-corruption reforms, or 
the ongoing war with Russia. The President 
only identified two people in reference to in-
vestigations: Vice President Biden and his 
son.138 
83. Listening to the call as it transpired, 
several White House staff members became 
alarmed. Lt. Col. Vindman immediately re-
ported his concerns to NSC lawyers because, 
as he testified, ‘‘[i]t is improper for the 
President of the United States to demand a 
foreign government investigate a U.S. cit-
izen and a political opponent.’’ 139 
84. Jennifer Williams, an advisor to Vice 
President Pence, testified that the call 
struck her as ‘‘unusual and inappropriate’’ 
and that ‘‘the references to specific individ-
uals and investigations, such as former Vice 
President Biden and his son, struck me as 
political in nature.’’ 140 She believed Presi-
dent Trump’s solicitation of an investigation 
was ‘‘inappropriate’’ because it ‘‘appeared to 
be a domestic political matter.’’ 141 
85. Timothy Morrison, Dr. Hill’s successor 
as the NSC’s Senior Director for Europe and 
Russia and Lt. Col. Vindman’s supervisor, 
said that ‘‘the call was not the full-throated 
endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda 
that I was hoping to hear.’’ 142 He too re-
ported the call to NSC lawyers, worrying 
that the call would be ‘‘damaging’’ if leaked 
publicly.143 
86. In response, Mr. Eisenberg and his dep-
uty, Michael Ellis, tightly restricted access 
to the call summary, which was placed on a 
highly classified NSC server even though it 
did not contain any highly classified infor-
mation.144 
87. On July 26, the day after the call, Am-
bassador Sondland had lunch with State De-
partment aides in Kyiv, including David 
Holmes, the Counselor for Political Affairs 
at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. During the 
lunch, Ambassador Sondland called Presi-
dent Trump directly from his cellphone. 
President 
Trump 
asked 
Ambassador 
Sondland whether President Zelensky was 
‘‘going to do the investigation.’’ Ambassador 
Sondland stated that President Zelensky was 
‘‘going to do it’’ and would ‘‘do anything you 
ask him to.’’ 145 
88. After the call, it was clear to Ambas-
sador Sondland that ‘‘a public statement 
from President Zelensky’’ committing to the 
investigations was a ‘‘prerequisite’’ for a 
White House meeting.146 He told Mr. Holmes 
that President Trump ‘‘did not give a [exple-
tive] about Ukraine.’’ Rather, the President 
cared only about ‘‘big stuff’’ that benefited 
him personally, like ‘‘the Biden investiga-
tion that Mr. Giuliani was pushing,’’ and 
that President Trump had directly solicited 
during the July 25 call.147 
F. President Trump Conditioned the Release 
of Security Assistance for Ukraine, and 
Continued To Leverage a White House 
Meeting, To Pressure Ukraine To Launch 
Politically Motivated Investigations 
89. As discussed further below, following 
the July 25 call, President Trump’s rep-
resentatives, 
including 
Ambassadors 
Sondland and Volker, in coordination with 
Mr. Giuliani, pressed the Ukrainians to issue 
a public statement announcing the inves-
tigations. At the same time, officials in both 
the United States and Ukraine became in-
creasingly 
concerned 
about 
President 
Trump’s continuing hold on security assist-
ance.148 
90. The Ukrainian government was aware 
of the hold by at least late July, around the 
time of President Trump’s July 25 call with 
President Zelensky. On the day of the call 
itself, DOD officials learned that diplomats 
at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, 
D.C., had made multiple overtures to DOD 
and the State Department ‘‘asking about se-
curity assistance.’’ 149 
91. Around this time, two different officials 
at the Ukrainian Embassy approached Am-
bassador Volker’s special advisor to ask her 
about the hold.150 
92. By mid-August, before the hold was 
public, Lt. Col. Vindman also received in-
quiries from the Ukrainian Embassy. Lt. Col. 
Vindman testified that during this time-
frame, ‘‘it was no secret, at least within gov-
ernment and official channels, that security 
assistance was on hold.’’ 151 
93. The former Ukrainian deputy foreign 
minister, Olena Zerkal, has acknowledged 
that she became aware of the hold on secu-
rity assistance no later than July 30 based on 
a diplomatic cable—transmitted the previous 
week—from Ukrainian officials in Wash-
ington, D.C.152
She said that President 
Zelensky’s office had received a copy of the 
cable ‘‘simultaneously.’’ 153 Ms. Zerkal fur-
ther stated that President Zelensky’s top ad-
visor, Andriy Yermak, told her ‘‘to keep si-
lent, to not comment without permission’’ 
about the hold or about when the Ukrainian 
government became aware of it.154 
94. In early August, Ambassadors Sondland 
and 
Volker, 
in 
coordination 
with 
Mr. 
Giuliani, endeavored to pressure President 
Zelensky to make a public statement an-
nouncing the investigations. On August 10— 
in a text message that showed the Ukrain-
ians’ understanding of the quid pro quo— 
President Zelensky’s advisor, Mr. Yermak, 
told Ambassador Volker that, once a date 
was set for the White House meeting, he 
would ‘‘call for a press briefing, announcing 
upcoming visit and outlining vision for the 
reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, includ-
ing among other things Burisma and election 
meddling in investigations[.]’’ 155 
95. On August 11, Ambassador Sondland 
emailed two State Department officials, one 
of whom acted as a direct line to Secretary 
Pompeo, to inform them about the agree-
ment for President Zelensky to issue a state-
ment that would include an announcement 
of 
the 
two 
investigations. 
Ambassador 
Sondland stated that he expected a draft of 
the statement to be ‘‘delivered for our review 
in a day or two[,]’’ and that he hoped the 
statement would ‘‘make the boss [i.e., Presi-
dent Trump] happy enough to authorize an 
invitation’’ for a White House meeting.156 
96. On August 12, Mr. Yermak texted Am-
bassador Volker an initial draft of the state-
ment. The draft referred to ‘‘the problem of

January 21, 2020 
interference in the political processes of the 
United States,’’ but it did not explicitly 
mention the two investigations that Presi-
dent Trump had requested in the July 25 
call.157 
97. The next day, Ambassadors Volker and 
Sondland discussed the draft statement with 
Mr. Giuliani, who told them, ‘‘If [the state-
ment] doesn’t say Burisma and 2016, it’s not 
credible[.]’’ 158
As 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
would later testify, ‘‘Mr. Giuliani was ex-
pressing the desires of the President of the 
United States, and we knew these investiga-
tions were important to the President.’’ 159 
98. Ambassadors Volker and Sondland re-
layed this message to Mr. Yermak and sent 
him a revised statement that included ex-
plicit references to ‘‘Burisma and the 2016 
U.S. elections.’’ 160 
99. In light of President Zelensky’s anti- 
corruption agenda, Ukrainian officials re-
sisted issuing the statement in August and, 
as a result, there was no movement toward 
scheduling the White House meeting.161 
100. Meanwhile, there was growing concern 
about President Trump’s continued hold on 
the security assistance for Ukraine. The hold 
remained in place through August, against 
the unanimous judgment of American na-
tional security officials charged with over-
seeing U.S.-Ukraine policy. For example, 
during a high-level interagency meeting in 
late July, officials unanimously advocated 
for releasing the hold—with the sole excep-
tion of OMB, which was acting under ‘‘guid-
ance from the President and from Acting 
Chief of Staff Mulvaney to freeze the assist-
ance.’’ 162 But even officials within OMB had 
internally recommended that the hold be re-
moved because ‘‘assistance to Ukraine is 
consistent with [U.S.] national security 
strategy,’’ provides the ‘‘benefit . . . of op-
posing Russian aggression,’’ and is backed by 
‘‘bipartisan support.’’ 163 
101. Without an explanation for the hold, 
and with President Trump already condi-
tioning a White House visit on the announce-
ment of the investigations, it became in-
creasingly apparent to multiple witnesses 
that the security assistance was being with-
held in order to pressure Ukraine to an-
nounce the investigations. As Ambassador 
Sondland testified, President Trump’s effort 
to condition release of the security assist-
ance on an announcement of the investiga-
tions was as clear as ‘‘two plus two equals 
four.’’ 164 
102. On August 22, Ambassador Sondland 
emailed Secretary Pompeo in an effort to 
‘‘break the logjam’’ on the security assist-
ance and the White House meeting. He pro-
posed that President Trump should arrange 
to speak to President Zelensky during an up-
coming trip to Warsaw, during which Presi-
dent 
Zelensky 
could 
‘‘look 
[President 
Trump] in the eye and tell him’’ he was pre-
pared ‘‘to move forward publicly . . . on 
those issues of importance to Potus and to 
the U.S.’’—i.e., the announcement of the two 
investigations.165 
103. On August 28, news of the hold was 
publicly reported by Politico.166 
104. As soon as the hold became public, 
Ukrainian officials expressed significant con-
cern to U.S. officials.167 They were deeply 
worried not only about the practical impact 
that the hold would have on efforts to fight 
Russian aggression, but also about the sym-
bolic message the now-publicized lack of sup-
port from the Trump Administration sent to 
the Russian government, which would al-
most certainly seek to exploit any real or 
perceived crack in U.S. resolve toward 
Ukraine. Mr. Yermak and other Ukrainian 
officials told Ambassador Taylor that they 
were ‘‘desperate’’ and would be willing to 
travel to Washington to raise with U.S. offi-
cials the importance of the assistance.168 The 
recently appointed Ukrainian prosecutor 
general later remarked, ‘‘It’s critically im-
portant for the west not to pull us into some 
conflicts between their ruling elites[.]’’ 169 
105. On September 1—within days of Presi-
dent Trump rejecting the request from Sec-
retaries Pompeo and Esper and Ambassador 
Bolton to release the hold 170—Vice President 
Pence met with President Zelensky in War-
saw, Poland after President Trump cancelled 
his trip.171 
106. In advance of this meeting, Ambas-
sador Sondland told Vice President Pence 
that he ‘‘had concerns that the delay in aid 
had become tied to the issue of investiga-
tions.’’ 172 Sondland testified that Vice Presi-
dent Pence ‘‘nodded like, you know, he heard 
what I said, and that was pretty much it.’’ 173 
107. During the meeting that followed, 
which Ambassador Sondland also attended, 
‘‘the very first question’’ that President 
Zelensky asked Vice President Pence related 
to the status of U.S. security assistance.174 
President Zelensky emphasized that ‘‘the 
symbolic value of U.S. support in terms of 
security assistance . . . was just as valuable 
to the Ukrainians as the actual dollars.’’ 175 
He also voiced concern that ‘‘any hold or ap-
pearance of reconsideration of such assist-
ance might embolden Russia to think that 
the United States was no longer committed 
to Ukraine.’’ 176 
108. Vice President Pence told President 
Zelensky that he would speak with President 
Trump that evening. Although Vice Presi-
dent Pence did speak with President Trump, 
the President still did not lift the hold.177 
109. Following the meeting between Vice 
President Pence and President Zelensky, 
Ambassador Sondland pulled aside President 
Zelensky’s advisor, Mr. Yermak, to explain 
that ‘‘the resumption of U.S. aid would like-
ly not occur until Ukraine took some kind of 
action on [issuing a] public statement’’ 
about the investigations.178 
110. Immediately following that conversa-
tion, Ambassador Sondland walked over to 
Mr. Morrison, who had been standing across 
the room observing their interactions. Am-
bassador Sondland told Mr. Morrison that 
‘‘what 
he 
had 
communicated 
[to 
Mr. 
Yermak] was that . . . what could help 
[Ukraine] move the aid was if the prosecutor 
general would go to the mike [sic] and an-
nounce 
that 
he 
was 
opening’’ 
the 
investigations.179 
111. Later that day, Mr. Morrison reported 
this conversation to Ambassador Bolton, 
who advised him to ‘‘stay out of it’’ and to 
brief the NSC’s lawyers. Mr. Morrison subse-
quently reported the conversation to Mr. 
Eisenberg.180 
112. Mr. Morrison also informed Ambas-
sador Taylor about his conversation with 
Ambassador Sondland. Ambassador Taylor 
was ‘‘alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told 
[him] about the Sondland-Yermak conversa-
tion.’’ 181 He followed up by texting Ambas-
sador Sondland, ‘‘Are we now saying that se-
curity assistance and WH meeting are condi-
tioned 
on 
investigations?’’ 
Ambassador 
Sondland responded, ‘‘Call me.’’ 182 
113. Ambassadors Sondland and Taylor 
then 
spoke 
by 
telephone. 
Ambassador 
Sondland again relayed what he told Mr. 
Yermak and explained that he had made a 
‘‘mistake’’ in telling Ukrainian officials that 
only the White House meeting was condi-
tioned on a public announcement of the in-
vestigations. 
He 
clarified 
that 
‘‘every-
thing’’—the White House meeting and secu-
rity assistance for Ukraine—was conditioned 
on the announcement of the investiga-
tions.183 Ambassador Sondland explained to 
Ambassador Taylor that ‘‘President Trump 
wanted President Zelensky in a public box, 
by making a public statement about order-
ing such investigations.’’ 184 
114. On September 7, President Trump and 
Ambassador Sondland spoke by telephone.185 
As Ambassador Sondland relayed later that 
day during a call with Mr. Morrison, Presi-
dent Trump told him ‘‘that there was no quid 
pro quo, but President Zelensky must an-
nounce the opening of the investigations and 
he should want to do it.’’ 186 
115. Mr. Morrison conveyed the substance 
of the September 7 call between President 
Trump and Ambassador Sondland to Ambas-
sador Taylor. Mr. Morrison said that the call 
had given him ‘‘a sinking feeling’’ because he 
feared the security assistance would not be 
released before September 30, the end of the 
fiscal year, and because he ‘‘did not think it 
was a good idea for the Ukrainian President 
to . . . involve himself in our politics.’’ 187 At 
Ambassador Bolton’s direction, Mr. Morrison 
reported Ambassador Sondland’s description 
of the President’s statements to the NSC 
lawyers.188 
116. The next day, September 8, Ambas-
sador Sondland confirmed in a phone call 
with Ambassador Taylor that he had spoken 
to President Trump and that ‘‘President 
Trump was adamant that President Zelensky 
himself had to’’ announce the investigations 
publicly.189 
117. Ambassador Sondland also told Am-
bassador Taylor that he had passed Presi-
dent Trump’s message directly to President 
Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and had told them 
that ‘‘although this was not a quid pro quo, 
if President Zelensky did not clear things up 
in public, we would be at a stalemate’’— 
meaning ‘‘Ukraine would not receive the 
much-needed military assistance.’’ 190 
118. Early the next morning, on September 
9, Ambassador Taylor texted Ambassadors 
Sondland and Volker: ‘‘As I said on the 
phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security 
assistance for help with a political cam-
paign.’’ 191 
119. The Ukrainians succumbed to the pres-
sure. In early September, President Zelensky 
agreed to do a televised interview, during 
which he would publicly announce the inves-
tigations. The Ukrainians made arrange-
ments for the interview to occur on CNN 
later in September.192 
120. The White House subsequently con-
firmed that the release of the security assist-
ance had been conditioned on Ukraine’s an-
nouncement of the investigations. During a 
White House press conference on October 17, 
Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney acknowl-
edged that he had discussed security assist-
ance with the President and that the Presi-
dent’s decision to withhold it was directly 
tied to his desire that Ukraine investigate 
alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 
U.S. election.193 
121. After a reporter attempted to clarify 
this explicit acknowledgement of a ‘‘quid pro 
quo,’’ Mr. Mulvaney replied, ‘‘We do that all 
the time with foreign policy.’’ He added, ‘‘I 
have news for everybody: get over it. There 
is going to be political influence in foreign 
policy.’’ 194 
122. Multiple foreign policy and national 
security officials testified that the pursuit of 
investigations into the Bidens and alleged 
Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election 
was not part of official U.S. policy.195 In-
stead, as Dr. Hill described, these investiga-
tions were part of a ‘‘domestic political er-
rand’’ of President Trump.196 Mr. Kent fur-
ther explained that urging Ukraine to en-
gage in ‘‘selective politically associated in-
vestigations or prosecutions’’ undermines 
our longstanding efforts to promote the rule 
of law abroad.197 
123. Ambassador Volker, in response to an 
inquiry from President Zelensky’s advisor, 
Mr. Yermak, confirmed that the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice (DOJ) did not make an offi-
cial request for Ukraine’s assistance in these 
investigations.198

January 21, 2020 
124. Within hours after the White House 
publicly released a record of the July 25 call, 
DOJ itself confirmed in a statement that no 
such request was ever made: 
The President has not spoken with the At-
torney General about having Ukraine inves-
tigate anything related to former Vice Presi-
dent Biden or his son. The President has not 
asked the Attorney General to contact 
Ukraine—on this or any other matter. The 
Attorney General has not communicated 
with Ukraine—on this or any other sub-
ject.199 
G. President Trump Was Forced to Lift the 
Hold but Has Continued to Solicit Foreign 
Interference in the Upcoming Election 
125. As noted above, by early September 
2019, President Zelensky had signaled his 
willingness to announce the two investiga-
tions to secure a White House meeting and 
the security assistance. He was scheduled to 
make the announcement during a CNN inter-
view later in September, but other events in-
tervened.200 
126. On September 9, the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence, the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform, and the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs announced a 
joint investigation into the scheme by Presi-
dent Trump ‘‘to improperly pressure the 
Ukrainian government to assist the Presi-
dent’s bid for reelection.’’ 201 The same day, 
the Committees sent document production 
and preservation requests to the White 
House and the State Department.202 
127. NSC staff members believed that the 
Congressional investigation ‘‘might have the 
effect of releasing the hold’’ on Ukraine mili-
tary assistance, because it would have been 
‘‘potentially 
politically 
challenging’’ 
to 
‘‘justify that hold.’’ 203 
128. Later that day, the Inspector General 
of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) wrote 
to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the 
Intelligence Committee notifying them that 
a whistleblower had filed a complaint on Au-
gust 12 that the ICIG had determined to be 
both an ‘‘urgent concern’’ and ‘‘credible.’’ 
The ICIG did not disclose the contents of the 
complaint.204 
129. The ICIG further stated that the Act-
ing Director of National Intelligence (DNI) 
had taken the unprecedented step of with-
holding the whistleblower complaint from 
Congress.205 It was later revealed that the 
Acting DNI had done so as a result of com-
munications with the White House and the 
Department of Justice.206 The next day, Sep-
tember 10, Chairman Schiff wrote to Acting 
DNI Joseph Maguire to express his concern 
about the Acting DNI’s ‘‘unprecedented de-
parture from past practice’’ in withholding 
the whistleblower complaint and observed 
that the ‘‘failure to transmit to the Com-
mittee an urgent and credible whistleblower 
complaint, as required by law, raises the 
prospect that an urgent matter of a serious 
nature is being purposefully concealed from 
the Committee.’’ 207 
130. The White House was aware of the con-
tents of the whistleblower complaint since at 
least August 26, when the Acting DNI in-
formed the White House Counsel’s Office of 
the complaint.208 White House Counsel Pat 
Cipollone 
and 
Mr. 
Eisenberg 
reportedly 
briefed President Trump on the whistle-
blower complaint in late August and dis-
cussed whether they had to give it to Con-
gress.209 
131. On September 11—two days after the 
ICIG notified Congress of the whistleblower 
complaint and the three House Committees 
announced 
their 
investigation—President 
Trump lifted the hold on security assistance. 
As with the implementation of the hold, no 
credible reason was provided for lifting the 
hold.210 At the time of the release, there had 
been no discernible changes in international 
assistance commitments for Ukraine or 
Ukrainian anti-corruption reforms.211 
132. Because of the hold the President 
placed on security assistance for Ukraine, 
DOD was unable to spend approximately $35 
million—or 14 percent—of the funds appro-
priated by Congress for fiscal year 2019.212 
133. Congress was forced to pass a new law 
to extend the funding in order to ensure the 
full amount could be used by Ukraine to de-
fend itself.213 Still, by early December 2019, 
Ukraine had not received approximately $20 
million of the military assistance.214 
134. Although the hold was lifted, the 
White House still had not announced a date 
for President Zelensky’s meeting with Presi-
dent Trump, and there were indications that 
President Zelensky’s interview with CNN 
would still occur.215 
135. On September 18, a week before Presi-
dent Trump was scheduled to meet with 
President Zelensky on the sidelines of the 
U.N. General Assembly in New York, Vice 
President Pence had a telephone call with 
President Zelensky. During the call, Vice 
President Pence ‘‘ask[ed] a bit more about 
. . . how Zelensky’s efforts were going.’’ 216 
Additional details about this call were pro-
vided to the House by Vice President Pence’s 
advisor, Jennifer Williams, but were classi-
fied by the Office of the Vice President.217 
Despite repeated requests, the Vice Presi-
dent has refused to declassify Ms. Williams’ 
supplemental testimony. 
136. On September 18 or 19, at the urging of 
Ambassador Taylor,218
President Zelensky 
cancelled the CNN interview.219 
137. To date, almost nine months after the 
initial invitation was extended by President 
Trump on April 21, a White House meeting 
for President Zelensky has not occurred.220 
Since 
the 
initial 
invitation, 
President 
Trump has met with more than a dozen 
world leaders at the White House, including 
a meeting in the Oval Office with the For-
eign Minister of Russia on December 10.221 
138. Since lifting the hold, and even after 
the House impeachment inquiry was an-
nounced on September 24, President Trump 
has continued to press Ukraine to inves-
tigate Vice President Biden and alleged 2016 
election interference by Ukraine.222 
139. On September 24, in remarks at the 
opening session of the U.N. General Assem-
bly, President Trump stated: ‘‘What Joe 
Biden did for his son, that’s something they 
[Ukraine] should be looking at.’’ 223 
140. On September 25, in a joint public 
press availability with President Zelensky, 
President Trump stated that ‘‘I want him to 
do whatever he can’’ in reference to the in-
vestigation of the Bidens.224 The same day, 
President Trump denied that his pursuit of 
the investigation involved a quid pro quo.225 
141. On September 30, during remarks at 
the swearing-in of the new Labor Secretary, 
President Trump stated: ‘‘Now, the new 
President of Ukraine ran on the basis of no 
corruption. . . . But there was a lot of cor-
ruption having to do with the 2016 election 
against us. And we want to get to the bottom 
of it, and it’s very important that we do.’’ 226 
142. On October 3, when asked by a reporter 
what he had hoped President Zelensky would 
do following their July 25 call, President 
Trump responded: ‘‘Well, I would think that, 
if they were honest about it, they’d start a 
major investigation into the Bidens. It’s a 
very simple answer.’’ 227 The President also 
suggested that ‘‘China should start an inves-
tigation into the Bidens, because what hap-
pened in China is just about as bad as what 
happened with—with Ukraine.228 
143. On October 4, President Trump equat-
ed his interest in ‘‘looking for corruption’’ to 
the investigation of two particular subjects: 
the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian inter-
ference in the 2016 election. He told report-
ers: 
What I want to do—and I think I have an 
obligation to do it, probably a duty to do it: 
corruption—we are looking for corruption. 
When you look at what Biden and his son 
did, and when you look at other people— 
what they’ve done. And I believe there was 
tremendous corruption with Biden, but I 
think there was beyond—I mean, beyond cor-
ruption—having to do with the 2016 cam-
paign, and what these lowlifes did to so 
many people, to hurt so many people in the 
Trump campaign—which was successful, de-
spite all of the fighting us. I mean, despite 
all of the unfairness.229 
When asked by a reporter, ‘‘Is someone ad-
vising you that it is okay to solicit the help 
of other governments to investigate a poten-
tial political opponent?,’’ Trump replied in 
part, ‘‘Here’s what’s okay: If we feel there’s 
corruption, like I feel there was in the 2016 
campaign—there was tremendous corruption 
against me—if we feel there’s corruption, we 
have a right to go to a foreign country.’’ 230 
144. As the House’s impeachment inquiry 
unfolded, Mr. Giuliani, on behalf of the 
President, also continued to urge Ukraine to 
pursue the investigations and dig up dirt on 
former Vice President Biden. Mr. Giuliani’s 
own statements about these efforts further 
confirm that he has been working in further-
ance of the President’s personal and political 
interests.231 
145. During the first week of December, Mr. 
Giuliani traveled to Kyiv and Budapest to 
meet with both current and former Ukrain-
ian government officials,232 including a cur-
rent Ukrainian member of Parliament who 
attended a KGB school in Moscow and has 
led calls to investigate Burisma and the 
Bidens.233 Mr. Giuliani also met with the cor-
rupt former prosecutor generals, Viktor 
Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko, who had pro-
moted the false allegations underlying the 
investigations President Trump wanted.234 
Mr. Giuliani told the New York Times that in 
meeting with Ukrainian officials he was act-
ing on behalf of his client, President Trump: 
‘‘[L]ike a good lawyer, I am gathering evi-
dence to defend my client against the false 
charges being leveled against him.’’ 235 
146. During his trip to Ukraine, on Decem-
ber 5, Mr. Giuliani tweeted: ‘‘The conversa-
tion about corruption in Ukraine was based 
on compelling evidence of criminal conduct 
by then VP Biden, in 2016, that has not been 
resolved and until it is will be a major obsta-
cle to the U.S. assisting Ukraine with its 
anti-corruption reforms.’’ 236 Not only was 
Mr. Giuliani perpetuating the false allega-
tions against Vice President Biden, but he 
was reiterating the threat that President 
Trump had used to pressure President 
Zelensky to announce the investigations: 
that U.S. assistance to Ukraine could be in 
jeopardy until Ukraine investigated Vice 
President Biden. 
147. Mr. Giuliani told the Wall Street Jour-
nal that when he returned to New York on 
December 7, President Trump called him as 
his plane was still taxiing down the runway. 
‘‘ ‘What did you get?’ he said Mr. Trump 
asked. ‘More than you can imagine,’ Mr. 
Giuliani replied.’’ 237 
148. Later that day, President Trump told 
reporters that he was aware of Mr. Giuliani’s 
efforts in Ukraine and believed that Mr. 
Giuliani wanted to report the information 
he’d gathered to the Attorney General and 
Congress.238 
149. On December 17, Mr. Giuliani con-
firmed that President Trump has been ‘‘very 
supportive’’ of his continuing efforts to dig 
up dirt on Vice President Biden in Ukraine 
and that they are ‘‘on the same page.’’ 239

S306 
January 21, 2020 
150. Such ongoing efforts by President 
Trump, including through his personal attor-
ney, to solicit an investigation of his polit-
ical opponent have undermined U.S. credi-
bility. On September 14, Ambassador Volker 
advised Mr. Yermak against the Zelensky 
Administration conducting an investigation 
into President Zelensky’s own former polit-
ical rival, former Ukrainian President Petro 
Poroshenko. 
When 
Ambassador 
Volker 
raised concerns about such an investigation, 
Mr. Yermak retorted, ‘‘What, you mean like 
asking 
us 
to 
investigate 
Clinton 
and 
Biden?’’ 240 Ambassador Volker offered no re-
sponse.241 
151. Mr. Holmes, a career diplomat, high-
lighted this hypocrisy: ‘‘While we had ad-
vised our Ukrainian counterparts to voice a 
commitment to following the rule of law and 
generally investigating credible corruption 
allegations,’’ U.S. officials were making ‘‘a 
demand that President Zelensky personally 
commit on a cable news channel to a specific 
investigation of President Trump’s political 
rival.’’ 242 
H. President Trump’s Conduct Was Con-
sistent with His Previous Invitations of 
Foreign Interference in U.S. Elections 
152. President Trump’s efforts to solicit 
Ukraine’s interference in the 2020 U.S. Presi-
dential election to help his own reelection 
campaign were consistent with his prior so-
licitation and encouragement of Russia’s in-
terference in the 2016 election, when the 
Trump Campaign ‘‘expected it would benefit 
electorally from information stolen and re-
leased through Russian efforts.’’ 243 
153. As a Presidential candidate, Mr. 
Trump repeatedly sought to benefit from 
Russia’s actions to help his campaign. For 
example, during a public rally on July 27, 
2016, then-candidate Trump declared: ‘‘Rus-
sia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to 
find the 30,000 emails that are missing’’ from 
opposing candidate Hillary Clinton’s per-
sonal server.244 Within hours, Russian hack-
ers targeted Clinton’s personal office for the 
first time.245 
154. Days earlier, WikiLeaks had begun re-
leasing emails and documents that were sto-
len by Russian military intelligence services 
in order to damage the Clinton campaign.246 
WikiLeaks continued releasing stolen docu-
ments through October 2016.247
Then-can-
didate Trump repeatedly applauded and 
sought to capitalize on WikiLeaks’s releases 
of these stolen documents, even after Rus-
sia’s involvement was heavily reported by 
the press.248 Members of the Trump Cam-
paign also planned messaging and commu-
nications 
strategies 
around 
releases 
by 
WikiLeaks.249 In the last month of the cam-
paign, then-candidate Trump publicly re-
ferred to the emails hacked by Russia and 
disseminated by WikiLeaks over 150 times.250 
155. Multiple members of the Trump Cam-
paign used additional channels to seek Rus-
sia’s assistance in obtaining damaging infor-
mation about Clinton. For example, senior 
representatives of the Trump Campaign—in-
cluding the Campaign’s chairman and the 
President’s son—met with a Russian attor-
ney in June 2016 who had offered to provide 
damaging information about Clinton from 
the Russian government.251 A foreign policy 
advisor to the Trump Campaign also met re-
peatedly with people connected to the Rus-
sian government and their associates, one of 
whom claimed to have ‘‘dirt’’ on Clinton in 
the form of ‘‘thousands of emails.’’ 252 
156. Even after Special Counsel Mueller re-
leased his report, President Trump con-
firmed his willingness to benefit from for-
eign election interference. When asked dur-
ing a televised interview in June 2019 wheth-
er he would accept damaging information 
from a foreign government about a political 
opponent, the President responded, ‘‘I think 
I’d take it.’’ 253 President Trump declared 
that he sees ‘‘nothing wrong with listening’’ 
to a foreign power that offers information 
detrimental 
to 
a 
political 
adversary.254 
Asked whether such an offer of information 
should be reported to law enforcement, 
President Trump retorted: ‘‘Give me a break, 
life doesn’t work that way.’’ 255 Just weeks 
later, President Trump froze security assist-
ance to Ukraine as his agents were pushing 
that country to pursue investigations that 
would help the President’s reelection cam-
paign.256 
157. In addition, President Trump’s request 
for the investigations on the July 25 call 
with President Zelensky took place one day 
after former Special Counsel Mueller testi-
fied before the House Judiciary Committee 
and the House Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence about the findings of his in-
vestigation into Russia’s interference in the 
2016 Presidential election and President 
Trump’s efforts to undermine that investiga-
tion.257
During his call with President 
Zelensky, President Trump derided former 
Special Counsel Mueller’s ‘‘poor perform-
ance’’ in his July 24 testimony and specu-
lated that ‘‘that whole nonsense . . . started 
with Ukraine.’’ 258 
II. President Trump’s Obstruction of Congress 
158. President Trump ordered categorical 
obstruction of the impeachment inquiry un-
dertaken by the House under Article I of the 
Constitution, which vests the House with the 
‘‘sole Power of Impeachment.’’ 259 
A. The House Launched an Impeachment 
Inquiry 
159. During the 116th Congress, a number of 
Committees of the House have undertaken 
investigations 
into 
allegations 
of 
mis-
conduct by President Trump and his Admin-
istration, including to determine whether to 
recommend articles of impeachment.260 
160. As discussed above, on September 9, 
the Intelligence Committee and the Commit-
tees on Oversight and Reform and Foreign 
Affairs announced they would conduct a 
joint 
investigation 
into 
the 
President’s 
scheme to pressure Ukraine to announce the 
politically motivated investigations.261 
161. Given the gravity of the allegations 
that President Trump was soliciting foreign 
interference in the upcoming 2020 election, 
Speaker Nancy P. Pelosi announced on Sep-
tember 24 that the House was ‘‘moving for-
ward with an official impeachment in-
quiry.’’ 262 Speaker Pelosi directed the Com-
mittees to ‘‘proceed with their investiga-
tions under that umbrella of [an] impeach-
ment inquiry.’’ 263 
162. On October 31, the House enacted a res-
olution confirming the Committees’ author-
ity to conduct the impeachment inquiry and 
adopting 
procedures 
governing 
the 
in-
quiry.264 
163. The procedures adopted by the House 
afforded procedural privileges to the Presi-
dent that were equivalent to, or in some in-
stances exceeded, those afforded during prior 
impeachment inquiries.265 Transcripts of all 
witness interviews and depositions were re-
leased to the public, and President Trump 
was offered—but refused—multiple opportu-
nities to have his counsel participate in pro-
ceedings before the Judiciary Committee, in-
cluding by cross-examining witnesses and 
presenting evidence.266 
B. President Trump Ordered Categorical Ob-
struction of the House’s Impeachment In-
quiry 
164. Even before the House launched its im-
peachment inquiry into President Trump’s 
misconduct concerning Ukraine, he rejected 
Congress’s Article I investigative and over-
sight authority, proclaiming, ‘‘[W]e’re fight-
ing all the subpoenas,’’ 267 and ‘‘I have an Ar-
ticle II, where I have the right to do what-
ever I want as president.’’ 268 
165. In response to the House impeachment 
inquiry regarding Ukraine, the Executive 
Branch categorically refused to provide any 
requested 
documents 
or 
information 
at 
President Trump’s direction. 
166. On September 9, 2019, three House 
Committees sent a letter to White House 
Counsel Pat Cipollone requesting six cat-
egories of documents relevant to the Ukraine 
investigation by September 16.269 When the 
White House did not respond, the Commit-
tees sent a follow-up letter on September 
24.270 
167. Instead of responding directly to the 
Committees, the President publicly declared 
the impeachment inquiry ‘‘a disgrace,’’ and 
stated that ‘‘it shouldn’t be allowed’’ and 
that ‘‘[t]here should be a way of stopping 
it.’’ 271 
168. When the White House still did not re-
spond to the Committees’ request, the Com-
mittees issued a subpoena compelling the 
White House to turn over documents.272 
169. 
The 
President’s 
response 
to 
the 
House’s inquiry—sent by Mr. Cipollone on 
October 8 sought to accomplish the Presi-
dent’s goal of ‘‘stopping’’ the House’s inves-
tigation. Mr. Cipollone wrote ‘‘on behalf of 
President Donald J. Trump’’ to notify Con-
gress that ‘‘President Trump cannot permit 
his Administration to participate in this par-
tisan inquiry under these circumstances.’’ 273 
170. Despite the Constitution’s placement 
of the ‘‘sole Power’’ of impeachment in the 
House, Mr. Cipollone’s October 8 letter 
opined that the House’s inquiry was ‘‘con-
stitutionally invalid,’’ ‘‘lack[ed] . . . any 
basis,’’ ‘‘lack[ed] the necessary authorization 
for a valid impeachment,’’ and was merely 
‘‘labeled 
. . . 
as 
an 
‘impeachment 
in-
quiry.’ ’’ 274 
171. The letter’s rhetoric aligned with the 
President’s public campaign against the im-
peachment inquiry, which he has branded ‘‘a 
COUP, intended to take away the Power of 
the People,’’ 275 an ‘‘unconstitutional abuse 
of power,’’ 276 and an ‘‘open war on American 
Democracy.’’ 277 
172. Although President Trump has cat-
egorically sought to obstruct the House’s im-
peachment inquiry, he has never formally as-
serted a claim of executive privilege as to 
any document or testimony. Mr. Cipollone’s 
October 8 letter refers to ‘‘long-established 
Executive Branch confidentiality interests 
and privileges’’ but the President did not ac-
tually assert executive privilege.278
Simi-
larly, a Department of Justice Office of 
Legal Counsel November 1, 2019 opinion only 
recognized that information responsive to 
the subpoenas was ‘‘potentially protected by 
executive privilege.’’ 279 
173. In addition, the President and his 
agents have spoken at length about these 
events to the press and on social media. 
Since the impeachment inquiry was an-
nounced on September 24, the President has 
made numerous public statements about his 
communications with President Zelensky 
and his decision-making relating to the hold 
on security assistance.280 
174. The President’s agents have done the 
same. For example, on October 16, Secretary 
Perry gave an interview to the Wall Street 
Journal. During the interview, Secretary 
Perry stated that after the May 23 meeting 
at which President Trump refused to sched-
ule a White House meeting with President 
Zelensky, Secretary Perry ‘‘sought out Rudy 
Giuliani this spring at President Trump’s di-
rection to address Mr. Trump’s concerns 
about alleged Ukrainian corruption.’’ 281 Dur-
ing a phone call with Secretary Perry, Mr. 
Giuliani said, ‘‘Look, the president is really 
concerned that there are people in Ukraine

that tried to beat him during this presi-
dential election. . . . He thinks they’re cor-
rupt and . . . that there are still people over 
there engaged that are absolutely cor-
rupt.’’ 282 
175. On October 17, Acting Chief of Staff 
Mulvaney acknowledged during a White 
House press conference that he discussed se-
curity assistance with the President and 
that the President’s decision to withhold it 
was directly tied to his desire that Ukraine 
investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in 
the 2016 U.S. election.283 
176. On December 3, 2019, the Intelligence 
Committee transmitted a detailed nearly 
300-page report documenting its findings 
about this scheme and about the related in-
vestigation into it, to the Judiciary Com-
mittee.284
The Judiciary Committee held 
public hearings evaluating the constitu-
tional standard for impeachment and the 
evidence against President Trump—in which 
the President’s counsel was invited to par-
ticipate, but declined—and then reported two 
Articles of Impeachment to the House.285 
177. The President maintained his obstruc-
tionist position throughout this process, de-
claring the House’s investigation ‘‘illegit-
imate’’ in a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
on December 17, 2019.286 President Trump fur-
ther attempted to undermine the House’s in-
quiry by dismissing impeachment as ‘‘ille-
gal, invalid, and unconstitutional’’ 287 and by 
intimidating and threatening an anonymous 
Intelligence Community whistleblower as 
well as the patriotic public servants who 
honored their subpoenas and testified before 
the House.288 
178. On December 18, 2019, the House voted 
to impeach President Trump and adopted 
two Articles of Impeachment.289 
C. Following President Trump’s Directive, 
the Executive Branch Refused to Produce 
Requested and Subpoenaed Documents 
179. Adhering to President Trump’s direc-
tive, every Executive Branch agency that re-
ceived an impeachment inquiry request or 
subpoena defied it.290 
180. House Committees issued document re-
quests or subpoenas to the White House, the 
Office of the Vice President, OMB, the De-
partment of State, DOD, and the Department 
of Energy.291 
181. In its response, the Office of the Vice 
President echoed Mr. Cipollone’s assertions 
that the impeachment inquiry was proce-
durally invalid,292
while agencies such as 
OMB and DOD expressly cited the Presi-
dent’s directive.293 
182. The Executive Branch has refused to 
produce any documents in response to the 
Committees’ valid, legally binding sub-
poenas, even though witness testimony has 
revealed 
that 
highly 
relevant 
records 
exist.294 
183. Indeed, by virtue of President Trump’s 
order, not a single document has been pro-
duced by the White House, the Office of the 
Vice President, OMB, the Department of 
State, DOD, or the Department of Energy in 
response to 71 specific, individualized re-
quests or demands for records in their pos-
session, custody, or control. These agencies 
and offices also blocked many current and 
former officials from producing records to 
the Committees.295 
184. Certain witnesses, however, defied the 
President’s order and identified the sub-
stance of key documents. For example, Lt. 
Col. Vindman described a ‘‘Presidential Deci-
sion Memo’’ he prepared in August that con-
veyed the ‘‘consensus views’’ among foreign 
policy and national security officials that 
the hold on aid to Ukraine should be re-
leased.296
Other witnesses identified addi-
tional documents that the President and var-
ious agencies were withholding from Con-
gress that were directly relevant to the im-
peachment inquiry.297 
185. Some responsive documents have been 
released by the State Department, DOD, and 
OMB pursuant to judicial orders issued in re-
sponse to lawsuits filed under the Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA).298 Although lim-
ited in scope and heavily redacted, these 
FOIA productions confirm that the Trump 
Administration is withholding highly perti-
nent documents from Congress without any 
valid legal basis.299 
D. President Trump Ordered Top Aides Not 
to Testify, Even Pursuant to Subpoena 
186. President Trump directed government 
witnesses to violate their legal obligations 
and defy House subpoenas—regardless of 
their offices or positions. In some instances, 
the President personally directed that senior 
aides defy subpoenas on the ground that they 
are ‘‘absolutely immune’’ from compelled 
testimony.300 Other officials refused to ap-
pear ‘‘as directed by’’ Mr. Cipollone’s Octo-
ber 8 letter.301 Still others refused to appear 
because—consistent with the House Deposi-
tion Rules drafted by the then-majority Re-
publicans—agency counsel was not permitted 
in the depositions.302 
187. This Administration-wide effort to pre-
vent witnesses from providing testimony was 
coordinated and comprehensive. In total, 
twelve current or former Administration of-
ficials refused to testify as part of the 
House’s 
impeachment 
inquiry 
into 
the 
Ukrainian matter, nine of whom did so in de-
fiance of duly authorized subpoenas.303 House 
Committees advised such witnesses that 
their refusal to testify may be used as an ad-
verse inference against the President.304 
Nonetheless—despite being instructed by 
senior political appointees not to cooperate 
with the House’s impeachment inquiry, in di-
rectives that frequently cited or enclosed 
copies of Mr. Cipollone’s October 8 letter 305— 
many current and former officials complied 
with their legal obligations to appear for tes-
timony. 
188. House Committees conducted deposi-
tions or transcribed interviews of seventeen 
witnesses.306 All members of the Commit-
tees—as well as staff from the Majority and 
the Minority—were permitted to attend. The 
Majority and Minority were allotted an 
equal amount of time to question wit-
nesses.307 
189. In late November 2019, twelve of these 
witnesses testified in public hearings con-
vened by the Intelligence Committee, includ-
ing three witnesses called by the Minority.308 
190. Unable to silence certain witnesses, 
President Trump resorted to intimidation 
tactics to penalize them.309 He also levied 
sustained attacks on the anonymous whistle-
blower.310 
E. President Trump’s Conduct Was Con-
sistent with His Previous Efforts to Ob-
struct Investigations into Foreign Inter-
ference in U.S. Elections 
191. President Trump’s obstruction of the 
House’s impeachment inquiry was consistent 
with his previous efforts to undermine Spe-
cial Counsel Mueller’s investigation of Rus-
sia’s interference in the 2016 election and of 
the President’s own misconduct. 
192. President Trump repeatedly used his 
powers of office to undermine and derail the 
Mueller 
investigation, 
particularly 
after 
learning that he was personally under inves-
tigation for obstruction of justice.311 Among 
other things, President Trump ordered White 
House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special 
Counsel Mueller; 312 instructed Mr. McGahn 
to create a record and issue statements false-
ly denying this event; 313 sought to curtail 
Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation in a 
manner exempting his own prior conduct; 314 
and tampered with at least two key wit-

President Trump has since in-
structed McGahn to defy a House Commit-
tee’s subpoena for testimony, and his DOJ 
has erroneously argued that the courts can 
play no role in enforcing Congressional sub-
poenas.316 
193. Special Counsel Mueller’s investiga-
tion—like the House’s impeachment in-
quiry—sought to uncover whether President 
Trump coordinated with a foreign govern-
ment in order to obtain an improper advan-
tage during a Presidential election.317 And 
the Mueller investigation—like the House’s 
impeachment 
inquiry—exposed 
President 
Trump’s eagerness to benefit from foreign 
election interference.318 In the former in-
stance, the President used his powers of of-
fice to undermine an investigation con-
ducted by officials within the Executive 
Branch.319 In the latter, he attempted to 
block the United States House of Represent-
atives from exercising its ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment’’ assigned by the Constitution. In 
both instances, President Trump obstructed 
investigations into foreign election inter-
ference to hide his own misconduct.

make sure that Ukraine was doing enough to 
manage that corruption.’’ Morrison Dep. Tr. 
at 165. Mr. Morrison did not testify that con-
cerns about Europe’s contributions were 
raised during this meeting. In addition, 
Mark Sandy testified that, as of July 26, de-
spite OMB’s own statement, senior OMB offi-
cials were unaware of the reason for the hold 
at that time. See Sandy Dep. Tr. at 55–56.

Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper testified

26 involving senior leadership from the State 
Department and DOD and officials from the 
National Security Council, ‘‘immediately 
deputies began to raise concerns about how 
this could be done in a legal fashion’’ and 
there ‘‘was a sense that there was not an 
available mechanism to simply not spend 
money’’ that already had been notified to 
Congress or earmarked for Ukraine. Cooper

185. In Ambassador Sondland’s testimony, 
he was not clear on whether he had one or 
two conversations with the President in 
which the subject of a quid pro quo came up, 
or on precisely which date such conversa-
tions took place during the period of Sep-
tember 6 through 9. Regardless of the date, 
Ambassador Sondland did not contest telling 
both Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor— 
both of whom took contemporaneous notes— 
of a conversation he had with the President 
that reaffirmed Ambassador Sondland’s un-
derstanding that President Zelensky had to 
make a public statement announcing the in-
vestigations in order to obtain the White 
House meeting and security assistance. See 
Sondland Hearing Tr. at 109. Both documen-
tary evidence and testimony confirmed that 
the conversation described by Mr. Morrison 
and Ambassador Taylor occurred on Sep-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

January 21, 2020 
318. See, e.g., id., Vol. I at 1–2 (the Trump 
Campaign 
‘‘expected 
it 
would 
benefit 
electorally from information stolen and re-
leased through Russian efforts’’). 
319. See generally id., Vol. II. As the Mueller 
Report summarizes, the Special Counsel’s in-
vestigation ‘‘found multiple acts by the 
President that were capable of exerting 
undue influence over law enforcement inves-
tigations, including the Russian-interference 
and obstruction investigations. The inci-
dents were often carried out through one-on- 
one meetings in which the President sought 
to use his official power outside of usual 
channels. These actions ranged from efforts 
to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse 
the effect of the Attorney General’s recusal; 
to the attempted use of official power to 
limit the scope of the investigation; to direct 
and indirect contacts with witnesses with 
the potential to influence their testimony.’’ 
Id., Vol. II at 157. 
[In Proceedings Before the United States 
Senate] 
TRIAL MEMORANDUM OF PRESIDENT DONALD J. 
TRUMP 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Articles of Impeachment now before 
the Senate are an affront to the Constitution 
and to our democratic institutions. The Arti-
cles themselves—and the rigged process that 
brought them here—are a brazenly political 
act by House Democrats that must be re-
jected. They debase the grave power of im-
peachment and disdain the solemn responsi-
bility that power entails. Anyone having the 
most basic respect for the sovereign will of 
the American people would shudder at the 
enormity of casting a vote to impeach a duly 
elected President. By contrast, upon tallying 
their votes, House Democrats jeered until 
they were scolded into silence by the Speak-
er. The process that brought the articles 
here violated every precedent and every 
principle of fairness followed in impeach-
ment inquiries for more than 150 years. Even 
so, all that House Democrats have succeeded 
in proving is that the President did abso-
lutely nothing wrong. 
After focus-group testing various charges 
for weeks, House Democrats settled on two 
flimsy Articles of Impeachment that allege 
no crime or violation of law whatsoever— 
much less ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors,’’ 
as required by the Constitution. They do not 
remotely 
approach 
the 
constitutional 
threshold for removing a President from of-
fice. The diluted standard asserted here 
would permanently weaken the Presidency 
and forever alter the balance among the 
branches of government in a manner that of-
fends the constitutional design established 
by the Founders. House Democrats jetti-
soned all precedent and principle because 
their impeachment inquisition was never 
really about discovering the truth or con-
ducting a fair investigation. Instead, House 
Democrats were determined from the outset 
to find some way—any way—to corrupt the 
extraordinary power of impeachment for use 
as a political tool to overturn the result of 
the 2016 election and to interfere in the 2020 
election. All of this is a dangerous perversion 
of the Constitution that the Senate should 
swiftly and roundly condemn. 
I. The articles fail because they do not identify 
any impeachable offense 
A. House Democrats’ Theory of ‘‘Abuse of 
Power’’ Is Not an Impeachable Offense 
House Democrats’ novel theory of ‘‘abuse 
of power’’ improperly supplants the standard 
of ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ with a 
made-up theory that would permanently 
weaken the Presidency by effectively per-
mitting impeachments based merely on pol-
icy disagreements. 
1. By limiting impeachment to cases of 
‘‘Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors,’’ 1 the Framers restricted im-
peachment to specific offenses against ‘‘al-
ready known and established law.’’ 2 That 
was a deliberate choice designed to constrain 
the impeachment power. In keeping with 
that restriction, every prior presidential im-
peachment in our history has been based on 
alleged violations of existing law—indeed, 
criminal law.3 House Democrats’ newly in-
vented ‘‘abuse of power’’ theory collapses at 
the threshold because it fails to allege any 
violation of law whatsoever. 
2. House Democrats’ concocted theory that 
the President can be impeached for taking 
permissible actions if he does them for what 
they believe to be the wrong reasons would 
also expand the impeachment power beyond 
constitutional bounds. It would allow a hos-
tile House to attack almost any presidential 
action by challenging a President’s subjec-
tive 
motives. 
Worse, 
House 
Democrats’ 
methods for identifying supposedly illicit 
motives ignore the constitutional structure 
of our government. As proof of improper mo-
tive, they claim that the President sup-
posedly ‘‘disregarded United States foreign 
policy towards Ukraine,’’ 4
that he was 
‘‘briefed on official policy’’ 5 but chose to ig-
nore it, and that he ‘‘ignored, defied, and 
confounded every office and agency within 
the Executive Branch.’’ 6
These assertions 
are preposterous and dangerous. They mis-
understand the assignment of power under 
the Constitution and the very concept of 
democratic accountability. Article II states 
that ‘‘[t]he executive Power shall be vested 
in a President.’’ 7 It is the President who de-
fines foreign policy, not the unelected bu-
reaucrats who are his subordinates. Any the-
ory of an impeachable offense that turns on 
ferreting out supposedly ‘‘constitutionally 
improper’’ 8 motives by measuring the Presi-
dent’s policy decisions against a purported 
interagency consensus 9 is both fundamen-
tally anti-democratic and an absurdly imper-
missible inversion of the constitutional 
structure. 
B. House Democrats’ Theory of ‘‘Obstruction 
of Congress’’ Is Not an Impeachable Offense 
House Democrats’ ‘‘obstruction of Con-
gress’’ claim is frivolous and dangerous. 
House Democrats propose removing the 
President from office because he asserted 
legal rights and privileges of the Executive 
Branch against defective subpoenas—based 
on advice from the Department of Justice. 
Accepting that theory would do lasting dam-
age to the separation of powers. 
1. President Trump properly asserted 
executive branch prerogatives 
Contrary to the mistaken charge that the 
President lacked ‘‘lawful cause or excuse’’ to 
resist House Democrats’ subpoenas,10
the 
President acted only after securing advice 
from the Department of Justice’s Office of 
Legal Counsel (OLC) and based on estab-
lished legal principles or immunities. 
a. Several Executive Branch officials re-
fused to comply with subpoenas purportedly 
issued pursuant to an ‘‘impeachment in-
quiry’’ before the House had authorized any 
such inquiry, because, as OLC advised, the 
subpoenas were unauthorized and had no 
legal force.11 
b. The President directed three of his most 
senior advisers not to comply with sub-
poenas seeking their testimony because they 
are immune from compelled testimony be-
fore Congress. Through administrations of 
both political parties, OLC ‘‘has repeatedly 
provided for nearly five decades’’ that ‘‘Con-
gress may not constitutionally compel the 
President’s senior advisers to testify about 
their official duties.’’ 12 In the Clinton ad-
ministration, for example, Attorney General 
Janet Reno explained that ‘‘the immunity 
such [immediate] advisers enjoy from testi-
monial compulsion by a congressional com-
mittee is absolute and may not be overborne 
by competing congressional interests.’’ 13 
c. Under the President’s supervision, Exec-
utive Branch officials were directed not to 
comply with subpoenas because the commit-
tees seeking their testimony refused to allow 
them to be accompanied by agency counsel. 
OLC concluded that the committees ‘‘may 
not bar agency counsel from assisting an ex-
ecutive branch witness without contravening 
the legitimate prerogatives of the Executive 
Branch,’’ and that attempting to enforce a 
subpoena 
while 
barring 
agency 
counsel 
‘‘would be unconstitutional.’’ 14 
2. Defending the separation of powers is not 
an impeachable offense 
Contrary to House Democrats’ claims, as-
serting legal rights and constitutional privi-
leges of the Executive Branch is not ‘‘ob-
struction.’’ 
a. In a government of laws, asserting legal 
defenses cannot be treated as obstruction; it 
is a fundamental right. As the Supreme 
Court has instructed: ‘‘[F]or an agent of the 
State to pursue a course of action whose ob-
jective is to penalize a person’s reliance on 
his legal rights is ‘patently unconstitu-
tional.’ ’’ 15 The same principles apply in im-
peachment. During the Clinton impeach-
ment, Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe 
put it this way: 
The allegations that invoking privileges 
and otherwise using the judicial system to 
shield information . . . is an abuse of power 
that should lead to impeachment and re-
moval from office is not only frivolous, but 
also dangerous.16 
In 1998, now-Chairman Jerrold Nadler 
agreed that a president cannot be impeached 
for asserting a legal privilege: ‘‘[T]he use of 
a legal privilege is not illegal or impeachable 
by itself, a legal privilege, executive privi-
lege.’’ 17
And Chairman Adam Schiff has 
turned the law on its head with his unprece-
dented claim that it is ‘‘obstruction’’ for any 
official to assert rights that might prompt 
House committees even ‘‘to consider litiga-
tion’’ to establish the validity of their sub-
poenas in court.18 
b. Where, as here, the principles the Presi-
dent invoked are critical for preserving Ex-
ecutive Branch prerogatives, treating the as-
sertion of privileges as ‘‘obstruction’’ would 
do permanent damage to the separation of 
powers—among all three branches. House 
Democrats have essentially announced that 
they may treat any resistance to their de-
mands as ‘‘obstruction’’ without taking any 
steps to resolve their dispute with the Presi-
dent. Accepting that unprecedented ap-
proach would fundamentally damage the sep-
aration of powers by making the House itself 
the sole judge of its authority. It would per-
mit Congress to threaten every President 
with impeachment merely for protecting the 
prerogatives of the Presidency. As Professor 
Jonathan Turley testified before the House 
Judiciary Committee: ‘‘Basing impeachment 
on this obstruction theory would itself be an 
abuse of power . . . by Congress.’’ 19 
c. At bottom, the ‘‘obstruction’’ charge 
asks the Senate to remove a duly elected 
President from office because he acted on 
the advice of the Department of Justice con-
cerning his legal and constitutional rights as 
President. Stating that proposition exposes 
it as frivolous. The Framers restricted im-
peachment to reach only egregious conduct 
that endangers the Constitution. A dif-
ference of legal opinion over whether sub-
poenas are enforceable cannot be dressed up 
to approach that level. As Edmund Randolph 
explained in the Virginia ratifying conven-
tion, ‘‘No man ever thought of impeaching a 
man for an opinion.’’ 20

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S314 
January 21, 2020 
II. The impeachment inquiry in the House was 
irredeemably flawed 
A. House Democrats’ Inquiry Violated All 
Precedent and Due Process 
1. The process that resulted in these Arti-
cles of Impeachment was flawed from the 
start. Since the Founding of the Republic, 
the House has never launched an impeach-
ment inquiry against a President without a 
vote of the full House authorizing it. And 
there is good reason for that. No committee 
can investigate pursuant to powers assigned 
by the Constitution to the House—including 
the ‘‘sole Power of Impeachment’’ 21—unless 
the House has voted to delegate authority to 
the committee.22 Here, it was emblematic of 
the lack of seriousness that characterized 
this whole process that House Democrats 
cast law and history aside and started their 
purported inquiry with nothing more than a 
press conference.23 On that authority alone, 
they issued nearly two dozen subpoenas that 
OLC determined were unauthorized and in-
valid.24 The full House did not vote to au-
thorize the inquiry until five weeks later 
when it adopted House Resolution 660 on Oc-
tober 31, 2019. That belated action was a tell-
ing admission that the process was unau-
thorized. 
2. Next, House Democrats concocted an un-
heard of procedure that denied the President 
any semblance of fair process. The pro-
ceedings began with secret hearings in a 
basement bunker before three committees 
under the direction of Chairman Schiff of the 
House Permanent Select Committee on In-
telligence (HPSCI). The President was denied 
any right to participate at all. He was denied 
the right to have counsel present, to cross 
examine witnesses, to call witnesses, and to 
see and present evidence. Meanwhile, House 
Democrats 
selectively 
leaked 
distorted 
versions of the secret testimony to compli-
ant members of the press, who happily fed 
the public a false narrative about the Presi-
dent. 
Then, House Democrats moved on to a true 
show trial as they brought their hand-picked 
witnesses, whose testimony had already been 
set in private, before the cameras to present 
prescreened testimony to the public. There, 
before HPSCI, they continued to deny the 
President any rights. He could not be rep-
resented by counsel, could not present evi-
dence or witnesses, and could not cross ex-
amine witnesses. 
This process not only violated every prece-
dent from the Nixon and Clinton impeach-
ment inquiries, it violated every principle of 
justice and fairness known to our legal tradi-
tion. For more than 250 years, the common 
law system has regarded cross-examination 
as the ‘‘greatest legal engine ever invented 
for the discovery of truth.’’ 25 House Demo-
crats denied the President that right and 
every other right because they were not in-
terested in the truth. Their only interest was 
securing an impeachment, and they knew 
that a fair process could not get them there. 
When the impeachment stage-show moved 
on to the Judiciary Committee, House Demo-
crats again denied the President his rights. 
The Committee had already decided to fore-
go fact-finding and to adopt the one-sided 
record from HPSCI’s ex parte hearings. 
Worse, Speaker Nancy Pelosi had already in-
structed the Committee to draft articles of 
impeachment. The only role for the Com-
mittee was to ram through the articles to se-
cure a House vote by Christmas.26 There 
could not have been a more blatant admis-
sion that evidence did not matter, the proc-
ess was rigged, and impeachment was a pre- 
ordained result. 
All of this reflected shameful hypocrisy 
from House Democrat leaders, who for dec-
ades had insisted on the importance of due 
process protections in an impeachment in-
quiry. Chairman Nadler himself has ex-
plained that a House impeachment inquiry 
‘‘demands a rigorous level of due process.’’ 27 
Specifically, he explained that ‘‘due process 
mean[s] . . . the right to confront the wit-
nesses against you, to call your own wit-
nesses, and to have the assistance of coun-
sel.’’ 28 Here, however, all due process rights 
were denied to the President. 
3. Chairman Schiff’s hearings were fatally 
defective for another reason—Schiff himself 
was instrumental in helping to create the 
story behind them. This inquiry centered on 
the President’s conversation on July 25, 2019, 
with the President of Ukraine. That call be-
came a matter of public speculation after a 
so-called whistleblower relayed a distorted, 
second-hand version of the call to the Inspec-
tor General of the Intelligence Community 
(ICIG). Before laundering his distortions 
through the ICIG, the same person secretly 
shared his false account with Chairman 
Schiff’s HPSCI staff and asked ‘‘for guid-
ance.’’ 29 After initially lying about it, Chair-
man Schiff was forced to admit that his staff 
had conferred with the so-called whistle-
blower before he filed his complaint. But the 
entirety of the role that Chairman Schiff and 
his staff played in orchestrating the com-
plaint that launched this entire farce re-
mains shrouded in secrecy to this day— 
Chairman Schiff himself shut down every ef-
fort to inquire into it. 
4. The denial of basic due process rights to 
the President is such a fundamental error in-
fecting the House proceedings that the Sen-
ate could not possibly rely upon the cor-
rupted House record to reach a verdict of 
conviction. Any such record is tainted, and 
any reliance on a record created through the 
wholesale denial of due process rights would 
be unconstitutional. Nor is it the Senate’s 
role to remedy the House’s errors by pro-
viding a ‘‘do-over’’ and developing the record 
itself. 
B. House Democrats’ Goal Was Never to 
Ascertain the Truth 
House Democrats resorted to these unprec-
edented procedures because the goal was 
never to get to the truth. The goal was to 
impeach the President, no matter the facts. 
House Democrats’ impeachment crusade 
started the day the President took office. As 
Speaker Pelosi confirmed in December 2019, 
her party’s quest to impeach the President 
had already been ‘‘going on for 22 months 
. . . [t]wo and a half years, actually.’’ 30 The 
moment the President was sworn in, The 
Washington Post reported that partisans had 
launched a campaign to impeach him.31 The 
current proceedings began with a complaint 
prepared with the assistance of a lawyer who 
declared in 2017 that he would use ‘‘impeach-
ment’’ to effect a ‘‘coup.’’ 32 
House Democrats originally pinned their 
impeachment hopes on the lie that the 
Trump Campaign had colluded with Russia 
during the 2016 election. That fixation 
brought the country the Mueller investiga-
tion. But after almost two years, $32 million, 
2,800 subpoenas, and nearly 500 search war-
rants 33—along with incalculable damage to 
the Nation—the Mueller investigation thor-
oughly disproved Democrats’ Russian collu-
sion delusion. To make matters worse, we 
now know that the Mueller investigation 
(and its precursor, Crossfire Hurricane) also 
brought with it shocking abuses in the use of 
FISA orders to spy on American citizens and 
a major-party presidential campaign—in-
cluding omissions and even outright lies to 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court 
and the fabrication of evidence by a com-
mitted partisan embedded in the FBI. 
House Democrats could not tolerate the 
findings of the Mueller Report debunking the 
collusion myth. Instead, they launched hear-
ings and issued subpoenas straining to find 
wrongdoing where Special Counsel Mueller 
and the Department of Justice had found 
none. And they launched new investigations, 
trying to rummage through the President’s 
tax returns and pushing fishing expeditions 
everywhere in the hope that they might find 
something. No other President in history has 
been subjected to a comparable barrage of 
investigations, subpoenas, and lawsuits, all 
in service of an insatiable partisan desire to 
find some way to remove him from office. 
When those proceedings went nowhere, 
House Democrats seized on the next vehicle 
that could be twisted to carry their impeach-
ment dream: a perfectly appropriate tele-
phone call between President Trump and the 
President of Ukraine. House Democrats have 
pursued their newly concocted charges for 
two reasons. First, they have been obsessed 
for years with overturning the 2016 election. 
Radical left Democrats have never been able 
to come to grips with losing the election, 
and impeachment provides them a way to 
nullify the judgment of the tens of millions 
of voters who rejected their candidate. Sec-
ond, they want to use impeachment to inter-
fere in the 2020 election. It is no accident 
that the Senate is being asked to consider a 
presidential impeachment during an election 
year. Put simply, Democrats have no re-
sponse to the President’s record of achieve-
ment in restoring prosperity to the Amer-
ican economy, rebuilding America’s mili-
tary, and confronting America’s adversaries 
abroad. Instead, they are held hostage by a 
radical left wing that has foisted on their 
party an agenda of socialism at home and ap-
peasement abroad that Democrat leaders 
know the American people will never accept. 
For the Democrats, impeachment became an 
electoral imperative. Congressman Al Green 
summarized that thinking best: ‘‘[I]f we 
don’t impeach the [P]resident, he will get re- 
elected.’’ 34 In their scorched-earth campaign 
against the President, House Democrats view 
impeachment merely as the continuation of 
politics by other means. 
The result of House Democrats’ pursuit of 
their obsessions—and their willingness to 
sacrifice every precedent and every principle 
standing in their way—is exactly what the 
Framers warned against: a wholly partisan 
impeachment. These articles were adopted 
without a single Republican vote. Indeed, 
there was bipartisan opposition to them.35 
Democrats used to recognize that the mo-
mentous act of overturning a national elec-
tion by impeaching a President should never 
be done on a partisan basis. As Chairman 
Nadler explained: 
There must never be a narrowly voted im-
peachment or an impeachment supported by 
one of our major political parties and op-
posed by another. Such an impeachment will 
produce divisiveness and bitterness in our 
politics for years to come, and will call into 
question the very legitimacy of our political 
institutions.36 
Senator Patrick Leahy agreed: ‘‘A partisan 
impeachment cannot command the respect 
of the American people. It is no more valid 
than a stolen election.’’ 37 Chairman Nadler, 
again, acknowledged that merely ‘‘hav[ing] 
the votes’’ and ‘‘hav[ing] the muscle’’ in the 
House, without ‘‘the legitimacy of a national 
consensus,’’ is just an attempted ‘‘partisan 
coup d’etat.’’ 38 Just last year, even Speaker 
Pelosi acknowledged that an impeachment 
‘‘would have to be so clearly bipartisan in 
terms of acceptance of it.’’ 39 All of these 
prior invocations of principle have now been 
abandoned, adding to the wreckage littering 
the wake of House Democrats’ impeach-at- 
all-costs strategy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S315 
January 21, 2020 
III. Article I fails because House Democrats 
have no evidence to support their claims 
A. The Evidence Shows That the President 
Did Not Condition Security Assistance or a 
Presidential Meeting on Announcements of 
Any Investigations 
House Democrats have falsely charged that 
the President supposedly conditioned mili-
tary aid or a presidential meeting on 
Ukraine’s announcing a specific investiga-
tion. Yet despite running an entirely ex 
parte, one-sided process to gather evidence, 
House Democrats do not have a single witness 
who claims, based on direct knowledge, that 
the President ever actually imposed such a 
condition. Several undisputed, core facts 
make clear that House Democrats’ charges 
are baseless. 
1. In an unprecedented display of trans-
parency, the President released the tran-
script of his July 25 call with President 
Volodymyr Zelensky, and it shows that the 
President did nothing wrong. The Depart-
ment of Justice reviewed the transcript 
months ago and rejected the suggestion by 
the ICIG (based on the whistleblower’s dis-
torted account) that the call might have 
raised an election-law violation.40 
2. President Zelensky, his Foreign Min-
ister, and other Ukrainian officials have re-
peatedly said there was no quid pro quo and 
no pressure placed on them by anyone. 
3. President Zelensky, his senior advisers, 
and House Democrats’ own witnesses have 
all confirmed that Ukraine’s senior leaders 
did not even know the aid was paused until 
after a Politico article was published on Au-
gust 28, 2019—over a month after the July 25 
call and barely two weeks before the aid was 
released on September 11. 
4. House Democrats’ case rests almost en-
tirely on: (i) statements from Ambassador to 
the European Union Gordon Sondland that 
he had come to believe (before talking to the 
President) that the aid and a meeting were 
‘‘likely’’ linked to investigations; and (ii) 
hearsay and speculation from others echoing 
Sondland 
second- 
or 
third-hand. 
But 
Sondland admitted that he was only ‘‘pre-
suming’’ a link.41 He stated unequivocally 
that he has no evidence ‘‘[o]ther than [his] 
own presumption’’ that President Trump 
connected releasing the aid to investiga-
tions, and he agreed that ‘‘[n]o one on this 
planet told [him] that Donald Trump was 
tying aid to investigations.’’ 42 Similarly, as 
for a link between a meeting and investiga-
tions, Sondland admitted that he was specu-
lating about that as well, based on hearsay.43 
When asked if ‘‘the President ever [told him] 
personally about any preconditions for any-
thing’’—i.e., for aid or a meeting—Sondland 
responded, ‘‘No.’’ 44 And when Ambassador 
Kurt Volker, the special envoy who had ac-
tually been negotiating with the Ukrainians, 
was asked if the President ever withheld a 
meeting to pressure the Ukrainians, he said: 
‘‘The answer to the question is no.’’ 45 
‘‘[T]here was no linkage like that.’’ 46 
The only two people with statements on 
record who spoke directly to the President 
on the matter—Sondland and Senator Ron 
Johnson—directly contradicted House Demo-
crats’ false allegations. Sondland testified 
that when he asked the President what he 
wanted, the President stated unequivocally: 
‘‘I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.’’ 47 
Similarly, Senator Johnson related that, 
when he asked the President if there was any 
linkage between investigations and the aid, 
the President responded: ‘‘(Expletive de-
leted)—No way. I would never do that.’’ 48 
5. The military aid flowed on September 11, 
2019, and a presidential meeting was first 
scheduled for September 1 and then took 
place on September 25, 2019, all without the 
Ukrainian government having done anything 
about investigations. 
6. The undisputed reality is that U.S. sup-
port for Ukraine against Russia has increased 
under President Trump. President Trump 
provided Ukraine Javelin anti-tank missiles 
to use against Russia after President Obama 
refused to provide that assistance. President 
Trump also imposed heavy sanctions on Rus-
sia, for which President Zelensky thanked 
him.49 A parade of State Department and Na-
tional Security Council (NSC) career offi-
cials universally acknowledged that Presi-
dent Trump’s policy was stronger in support 
of Ukraine against Russia than his prede-
cessor’s. Ambassador Yovanovitch testified 
that ‘‘our policy actually got stronger’’ 
under President Trump,50 and Ambassador 
Taylor agreed that aid under President 
Trump was a ‘‘substantial improvement’’ 
over the previous administration, largely be-
cause ‘‘this administration provided Javelin 
anti-tank weapons,’’ which ‘‘are serious 
weapons’’ that ‘‘will kill Russian tanks.’’ 51 
The evidence shows that President Trump 
had legitimate concerns about corruption 
and burden-sharing with our allies—two con-
sistent themes in his foreign policy. When 
his concerns had been addressed, the aid was 
released on September 11 without any action 
concerning investigations. Similarly, a bilat-
eral meeting with President Zelensky was 
first scheduled for September 1 in Warsaw 
and, after rescheduling due to Hurricane Do-
rian, took place on September 25 in New 
York, again, all without the Ukrainians 
doing anything related to investigations. 
As Professor Turley summed it up, this im-
peachment ‘‘stand[s] out among modern im-
peachments as the shortest proceeding, with 
the thinnest evidentiary record, and the nar-
rowest grounds ever used to impeach a presi-
dent.’’ 52 It is a constitutional travesty. 
B. House Democrats Rest on the False 
Premise that There Could Have Been No 
Legitimate Reason To Mention 2016 or the 
Biden-Burisma Affair 
The charges in Article I are further flawed 
because they rest on the mistaken premise 
that it would have been illegitimate for the 
President to mention to President Zelensky 
either (i) possible Ukrainian interference in 
the 2016 election; or (ii) an incident in which 
then-Vice President Biden had forced the dis-
missal of a Ukrainian prosecutor. House 
Democrats acknowledge that, even under 
their theory of ‘‘abuse of power,’’ they must 
establish (in their words) that these matters 
were ‘‘bogus’’ or ‘‘sham investigations’’ 53— 
that the only reason for raising them would 
have been ‘‘to obtain an improper personal 
political benefit.’’ 54 But that is obviously 
false. Even if the President had raised those 
issues, there were legitimate reasons to do 
so. 
1. Uncovering potential foreign inter-
ference in U.S. elections is always a legiti-
mate goal, whatever the source of the inter-
ference and whether or not it fits with 
Democrats’ preferred narrative about 2016. 
House Democrats’ assertion that asking his-
torical questions about the last election 
somehow equates to securing ‘‘improper in-
terference’’ in the next election is nonsen-
sical. Asking about the past cannot be twist-
ed into interference in a future election. 
Even if facts uncovered about conduct in the 
last election were to have some impact on 
the next election, uncovering historical facts 
is not improper interference. Nor can House 
Democrats self-servingly equate asking any 
questions about Ukraine with advocating 
that Ukraine, instead of Russia, interfered in 
2016.55 Actors in more than one country can 
interfere in an election at the same time, in 
different ways and for different purposes. 
And there has been plenty of public report-
ing to give reason to be suspicious about 
many Ukrainians’ conduct in 2016. Even one 
of House Democrats’ own star witnesses, Dr. 
Fiona Hill, acknowledged that Ukrainian of-
ficials ‘‘bet on Hillary Clinton winning the 
election,’’ and that ‘‘they were trying to 
curry favor with the Clinton campaign’’ in-
cluding by ‘‘trying to collect information 
. . . on Mr. Manafort and on other people as 
well.’’ 56 All of that—and more—provides le-
gitimate grounds for inquiry. 
2. It also would have been legitimate to 
mention the Biden-Burisma affair. Public re-
ports indicate that then-Vice President 
Biden threatened withholding U.S. loan 
guarantees to secure the dismissal of a 
Ukrainian prosecutor even though Biden 
was, at the time, operating under what ap-
peared to be, at the very least, a serious con-
flict of interest. The prosecutor reportedly 
had been investigating Burisma—a Ukrain-
ian energy company notorious for corrup-
tion—and Biden’s son, Hunter, was sitting on 
Burisma’s board.57 Unless being son of the 
Vice President counted, Hunter had no ap-
parent qualifications to merit that seat, or 
to merit being compensated (apparently) 
more richly than board members at Fortune 
100 energy giants like ConocoPhillips.58 In 
fact, numerous career State Department and 
NSC employees agreed that Hunter Biden’s 
connection with Burisma created, at a min-
imum, the appearance of a conflict of inter-
est,59 and The Washington Post reported as 
early as 2014 that ‘‘[t]he appointment of the 
[V]ice [P]resident’s son to a Ukrainian oil 
board looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at 
worst.’’ 60 More than one official raised the 
issue with the Vice President’s office at the 
time, but the Vice President took no action 
in response.61 
On those facts, it would have been appro-
priate to raise this incident with President 
Zelensky. Ukraine cannot rid itself of cor-
ruption if its prosecutors are always sty-
mied. Here, public reports suggested that 
Vice President Biden played a role in derail-
ing a legitimate inquiry while under a monu-
mental conflict of interest. If Biden were not 
running for President, House Democrats 
would not argue that merely raising the inci-
dent would have been improper. But former 
Vice President Biden did not immunize his 
past conduct (or his son’s) from all scrutiny 
simply by declaring his candidacy for the 
presidency. 
Importantly, even under House Democrats’ 
theory, mentioning the matter to President 
Zelensky would have been entirely justified 
as long as there was a basis to think that 
would advance the public interest. To defend 
merely asking a question, the President would 
not have to show that Vice President Biden 
(or his son) actually committed any wrong-
doing. By contrast, under their own theory 
of the case, to show ‘‘abuse of power,’’ the 
House Managers would have to prove that 
the inquiry could have no public purpose 
whatsoever. They have no such evidence. The 
record shows it would have been legitimate 
to mention the Biden-Burisma affair. 
IV. The articles are structurally deficient and 
can only result in acquittal 
The articles are also defective because 
each charges multiple different acts as pos-
sible grounds for conviction. The problem 
with offering such a menu of options is that, 
for a valid conviction, the Constitution re-
quires two-thirds of Senators present to 
agree on the specific basis for conviction. A 
vote on these articles, however, cannot en-
sure that a two-thirds majority agreed on a 
particular ground for conviction. Instead, 
such a vote could reflect an amalgamation of 
votes resting on several different theories, 
no single one of which would have garnered 
two-thirds support if it had been presented 
separately. This structural deficiency cannot 
be remedied by dividing the different allega-
tions within each article for voting, because

that is prohibited under Senate rules.62 The 
only constitutional option is for the Senate 
to reject the articles as framed and acquit 
the President. 
The Framers foresaw that the House might 
at times fall prey to tempestuous partisan 
tempers. 
Alexander 
Hamilton 
recognized 
that ‘‘the persecution of an intemperate or 
designing majority in the House of Rep-
resentatives’’ was a real danger in impeach-
ments,63
and Jefferson acknowledged that 
impeachment provided ‘‘the most formidable 
weapon for the purposes of dominant faction 
that ever was contrived.’’ 64 That is why the 
Framers entrusted the trial of impeachments 
to the Senate. As Justice Story explained, 
the Framers saw the Senate as a tribunal 
‘‘removed from popular power and passions 
. . . and from the more dangerous influence 
of mere party spirit,’’ and guided by ‘‘a deep 
responsibility to future times.’’ 65 Now, per-
haps as never before, it is essential for the 
Senate to fulfill the role Hamilton envi-
sioned for it as a ‘‘guard[] against the danger 
of persecution, from the prevalency of a fac-
tious spirit’’ in the House.66 
The Senate should speedily reject these de-
ficient Articles of Impeachment and acquit 
the President. The only threat to the Con-
stitution 
that 
House 
Democrats 
have 
brought to light is their own degradation of 
the impeachment process and trampling of 
the separation of powers. Their fixation on 
damaging the President has trivialized the 
momentous act of impeachment, debased the 
standards of impeachable conduct, and per-
verted the power of impeachment by turning 
it into a partisan, election-year political 
tool. The consequences of accepting House 
Democrats’ diluted standards for impeach-
ment would reverberate far beyond this elec-
tion year and do lasting damage to our Re-
public. As Senator Lyman Trumbull, one of 
the seven Republican Senators who crossed 
the aisle to vote against wrongfully con-
victing 
President 
Andrew 
Johnson, 
ex-
plained: ‘‘Once [we] set the example of im-
peaching a President for what, when the ex-
citement of the hour shall have subsided, 
will be regarded as insufficient causes . . . no 
future President will be safe . . . . [A]nd 
what then becomes of the checks and bal-
ances of the Constitution, so carefully de-
vised and so vital to its perpetuity? They are 
all gone.’’ 67 It is the solemn duty of this 
body to be the bulwark of the Constitution 
protecting against exactly this result. 
Enough of the Nation’s time and resources 
have been wasted on House Democrats’ par-
tisan obsessions. The Senate should bring a 
decisive end to these excesses so that Con-
gress can get back to its real job: working 
together with the President to improve the 
lives of all Americans. 
STANDARDS 
The extraordinary process invoked by 
House Democrats under Article II, Section 4 
of the Constitution is not the constitu-
tionally preferred means to determine who 
should lead our country. It is a mechanism 
of last resort, reserved for exceptional cir-
cumstances—not present here—in which a 
President has engaged in unlawful conduct 
that strikes at the core of our constitutional 
system of government. 
A. The Senate Must Decide All Questions of 
Law and Fact. 
The Constitution makes clear that an im-
peachment by the House of Representatives 
is nothing more than an accusation. The Ar-
ticles of Impeachment approved by the 
House come to the Senate with no presump-
tion of regularity in their favor. On each of 
the two prior occasions that the House 
adopted articles of impeachment against a 
President, the Senate refused to convict on 
them. Indeed, the Framers wisely forewarned 
that the House could impeach for the wrong 
reasons.68 That is why the Constitution en-
trusts the Senate with the ‘‘sole Power to 
try all Impeachments.’’ 69 Under that charge, 
it is the Senate’s constitutional duty to de-
cide for itself all matters of law and fact 
bearing upon this trial.70 These decisions in-
clude whether the accusation presented by 
House Democrats even rises to the level of 
describing 
an 
impeachable 
offense, 
the 
standard of proof that House Democrats 
must meet to prove their case, and whether 
they have met this burden. As Rep. John 
Logan, a House manager in President John-
son’s impeachment trial, explained ‘‘all 
questions of law or of fact are to be decided 
in these proceedings by the final vote’’ 71 of 
the Senate, and ‘‘in determining this general 
issue Senators must consider the sufficiency 
or insufficiency in law or in fact of every ar-
ticle of accusation.’’ 72 
B. An Impeachable Offense Requires a Violation 
of Established Law that Inflicts Sufficiently 
Egregious Harm on the Government that It 
Threatens to Subvert the Constitution. 
The President of the United States occu-
pies a unique position in the structure of our 
government. He is chosen directly by the 
People through a national election to be the 
head of an entire branch of government and 
Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and 
is entrusted with enormous responsibilities 
for setting policies for the Nation. Whether 
Congress should supplant the will expressed 
by tens of millions of voters by removing the 
President from office is a question of breath-
taking gravity. Approaching that question 
requires a clear understanding of the limits 
the Constitution places on what counts—and 
what does not count—as an impeachable of-
fense. 
1. Text and Drafting History of the 
Impeachment Clause 
Fearful that the power of impeachment 
might be abused, and recognizing that con-
stitutional protections were required for the 
Executive, the Framers crafted a limited 
power of impeachment.73 The Constitution 
restricts impeachment to enumerated of-
fenses: ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 74 Treason and 
bribery are well defined offenses and are not 
at issue in this case. The operative text here 
is the more general phrase ‘‘other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ The structure 
and language of the clause—the use of the 
adjective ‘‘other’’ to describe ‘‘high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’ in a list immediately 
following the specific offenses ‘‘Treason’’ and 
‘‘Bribery’’—calls for applying the ejusdem 
generis canon of interpretation. This canon 
instructs that ‘‘ ‘[w]here general words fol-
low specific words in a statutory enumera-
tion, the general words are construed to em-
brace only objects similar in nature to those 
objects enumerated by the preceding specific 
words.’’ 75 Under that principle, ‘‘other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ must be under-
stood to have the same qualities—in terms of 
seriousness and their effect on the func-
tioning of government—as the crimes of 
‘‘Treason’’ and ‘‘Bribery.’’ 76 
Treason is defined specifically in the Con-
stitution and ‘‘consist[s] only in levying War 
against [the United States], or in adhering to 
their Enemies, giving them Aid and Com-
fort.’’ 77 This offense is ‘‘a crime against and 
undermining the very existence of the Gov-
ernment.’’ 78 Bribery, like treason, is a seri-
ous offense against the government that sub-
verts the proper functioning of the state. 
Blackstone, a ‘‘dominant source of author-
ity’’ for the Framers,79 called bribery an ‘‘of-
fense against public justice.’’ 80
Professor 
Akhil Amar describes bribery as ‘‘secretly 
bending laws to favor the rich and powerful’’ 
and contends that in this context it ‘‘in-
volves official corruption of a highly malig-
nant sort, threatening the very soul of a de-
mocracy committed to equality under the 
law.’’ 81
According 
to 
Professor 
Philip 
Bobbitt, ‘‘[l]ike treason, the impeachable of-
fense of bribery . . . must be an act that ac-
tually threatens the constitutional stability 
and security of the State.’’ 82 The text of the 
Constitution thus indicates that the ‘‘other’’ 
crimes and misdemeanors that qualify as im-
peachable offenses must be sufficiently egre-
gious that, like treason and bribery, they in-
volve a fundamental betrayal that threatens 
to subvert the constitutional order of gov-
ernment. 
Treason and bribery are also, of course, of-
fenses defined by law. Each of the seven 
other references in the Constitution to im-
peachment also supports the conclusion that 
impeachments must be evaluated in terms of 
offenses against settled law: The Constitu-
tion refers to ‘‘Conviction’’ for impeachable 
offenses twice 83 and ‘‘Judgment in Cases of 
Impeachment.’’ 84 It directs the Senate to 
‘‘try all Impeachments’’ 85 and requires the 
Chief Justice’s participation when the Presi-
dent is ‘‘tried.’’ 86 And it implies impeachable 
offenses are ‘‘Crimes’’ and ‘‘Offenses’’ in the 
Jury Trial Clause and the Pardon Clause, re-
spectively.87 These are all words that indi-
cate violations of established law. 
The use of the term ‘‘high’’ in the Im-
peachment Clause is also significant, and 
was clearly deliberate. Under English com-
mon law, ‘‘high’’ indicated crimes against 
the state; Blackstone defined ‘‘high treason’’ 
to include only offenses against ‘‘the su-
preme executive power, or the king and his 
government,’’ calling it the ‘‘highest civil 
crime.’’ 88 
In 
addition, 
‘‘high 
Crimes 
and 
Mis-
demeanors’’ had a technical meaning in 
English law,89 and there is evidence that the 
Framers were aware of this ‘‘limited,’’ ‘‘tech-
nical meaning.’’ 90 In England, ‘‘high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’ referred to offenses that 
could be the subject of impeachment in par-
liament. No less an authority than Black-
stone, however, made clear that ‘‘an im-
peachment before the lords by the commons 
of Great Britain, in parliament, is a prosecu-
tion of the already known and established 
law.’’ 91 As a result, nothing in the Constitu-
tion’s use of the term ‘‘other high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’ suggests that impeach-
ment under the Constitution could reach 
anything other than a known offense defined 
in existing law. 
Significantly, the records of the Constitu-
tional Convention also make clear that, in 
important respects, the Framers intended 
the scope of impeachable offenses under the 
Constitution to be much narrower than under 
English practice. When the draft Constitu-
tion had limited the grounds for impeach-
ment to ‘‘Treason, or bribery,’’ 92
George 
Mason argued that the provision was too 
narrow because ‘‘[a]ttempts to subvert the 
Constitution may not be Treason’’ and that 
the clause ‘‘will not reach many great and 
dangerous offenses.’’ 93 He proposed the addi-
tion of ‘‘maladministration,’’ 94 which had 
been a ground for impeachment in English 
practice. Madison opposed that change on 
the ground that ‘‘[s]o vague a term’’ would 
make the President subject to ‘‘a tenure dur-
ing [the] pleasure of the Senate,’’ 95 and the 
Convention agreed on adding ‘‘other high 
crimes & misdemeanors’’ instead.96 
By rejecting ‘‘maladministration,’’ the 
Framers significantly narrowed impeach-
ment under the Constitution and made clear 
that mere differences of opinion, unpopular 
policy decisions, or perceived misjudgments 
cannot constitutionally be used as the basis 
for impeachment. Indeed, at various earlier 
points during the Convention, drafts of the 
Constitution had included as grounds for im-
peachment 
‘‘malpractice 
or 
neglect 
of

duty’’ 97
and 
‘‘neglect 
of 
duty 
[and] 
malversation,’’ 98 but the Framers rejected 
all of these formulations. The ratification 
debates confirmed the point that differences 
of opinion or differences over policy could 
not justify impeachment. James Iredell 
warned delegates to North Carolina’s ratify-
ing convention that ‘‘[a] mere difference of 
opinion might be interpreted, by the malig-
nity of party, into a deliberate, wicked ac-
tion,’’ 99 and thus should not provide the 
basis for impeachment. And Edmund Ran-
dolph pointed out in the Virginia ratifying 
convention that ‘‘[n]o man ever thought of 
impeaching a man for an opinion.’’ 100 
Taken together, the text, drafting history, 
and debates surrounding the Constitution 
make several points clear. First, the debates 
‘‘make quite plain that the Framers, far 
from proposing to confer illimitable power to 
impeach and convict, intended to confer a 
limited power.’’ 101 As Senator Leahy has put 
it, ‘‘[t]he Framers purposely restrained the 
Congress and carefully circumscribed [its] 
power to remove the head of the co-equal Ex-
ecutive Branch.’’ 102 
Second, the terminology of ‘‘high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’ makes clear that an im-
peachable offense must be a violation of es-
tablished law. The Impeachment Clause did 
not confer upon Congress a roving license to 
make up new standards of conduct for gov-
ernment officials and to permit removal 
from office merely on a conclusion that con-
duct was ‘‘bad’’ if there was not an existing 
law that it violated. 
Third, by establishing that ‘‘other’’ im-
peachable offenses must fall in the same 
class as the specific offenses of ‘‘treason’’ 
and ‘‘bribery,’’ the Framers intended to es-
tablish a requirement of particularly egre-
gious conduct threatening the constitutional 
order to justify impeachment. Justice Story 
recognized impeachment was ‘‘intended for 
occasional and extraordinary cases’’ only.103 
For Professor Bobbitt, ‘‘[a]n impeachable of-
fense is one that puts the Constitution in 
jeopardy.’’ 104 Removal of the freely elected 
President of the United States based on any 
lesser standard would violate the plan of the 
Founders, who built our government on the 
principle it would ‘‘deriv[e] [its] just powers 
from the consent of the governed.’’ 105 
2. The President’s Unique Role in Our 
Constitutional Structure 
For at least two reasons, the President’s 
unique role in our constitutional structure 
buttresses the conclusion that offenses war-
ranting presidential impeachment must in-
volve especially egregious conduct that 
threatens to subvert the constitutional order 
of government. 
First, conviction of a President raises par-
ticularly profound issues under our constitu-
tional structure because it means over-
turning the democratically expressed will of 
the people in the only national election in 
which all eligible citizens participate. The 
impeachment power permits the possibility 
that ‘‘the legislative branch [will] essen-
tially cancel[] the results of the most solemn 
collective act of which we as a constitutional 
democracy are capable: the national election 
of a President.’’106 
As even the House Managers have acknowl-
edged, ‘‘the issue’’ in a presidential impeach-
ment trial ‘‘is whether to overturn the re-
sults of a national election, the free expres-
sion of the popular will of the American peo-
ple.’’ 107 That step can be justified only by an 
offense crossing an exceptional threshold. As 
Chairman Nadler has put it, ‘‘[w]e must not 
overturn an election and remove a President 
from office except to defend our system of 
government or our constitutional liberties 
against a dire threat . . . .’’ 108 Especially 
where the American people are already start-
ing the process of voting for candidates for 
the next presidential election, removing a 
President from office and taking that deci-
sion away from the people requires meeting 
an extraordinarily high standard. As then- 
Senator Biden confirmed during President 
Clinton’s trial, ‘‘to remove a duly elected 
president will unavoidably harm our con-
stitutional structure’’ and ‘‘[r]emoving the 
President from office without compelling 
evidence would be historically anti-demo-
cratic.’’ 109 
Any lesser standard would be inconsistent 
with the unique importance of the Presi-
dent’s role in the structure of the govern-
ment, the profound disruption and danger of 
uncertainty that attend to removing a presi-
dent from office, and the grave implications 
of negating the will of the people expressed 
in a national election. 
Second, because the President himself is 
vested with the authority of an entire 
branch of the federal government, his re-
moval would cause extraordinary disruption 
to the Nation. Article II, Section 1 declares 
in no uncertain terms that ‘‘[t]he executive 
Power shall be vested in a President of the 
United States of America.’’ 110
As Justice 
Breyer has explained, ‘‘Article II makes a 
single President responsible for the actions 
of the Executive Branch in much the same 
way that the entire Congress is responsible 
for the actions of the Legislative Branch, or 
the entire Judiciary for those of the Judicial 
Branch.’’ 111 As a result, ‘‘the application of 
the Impeachment Clause to the President of 
the United States involves the uniquely sol-
emn act of having one branch essentially 
overthrow another.’’ 112 It also carries the 
risk of profound disruption for the operation 
of the federal government. 
As ‘‘the chief constitutional officer of the 
Executive branch,’’ the President is ‘‘en-
trusted with supervisory and policy respon-
sibilities of utmost discretion and sensi-
tivity.’’ 113 Because he is assigned responsi-
bility to ‘‘take Care that the Laws be faith-
fully executed,’’ 114 all federal law enforce-
ment depends, ultimately, on the direction 
of the President. In addition, he is the Com-
mander-in-Chief of the armed forces 115 and 
‘‘the sole organ of the federal government in 
the field of international relations.’’ 116 The 
foreign policy of the Nation is determined 
primarily by the President. His removal 
would necessarily create uncertainty and 
pose unique risks for U.S. interests around 
the globe. As OLC put it, removal of the 
President would be ‘‘politically and constitu-
tionally a traumatic event,’’ 117 and Senator 
Bob Graham rightly called it ‘‘one of the 
most disruptive acts imaginable in a democ-
racy’’ during President Clinton’s trial.118 
3. Practice Under the Impeachment Clause 
The practical application of the Impeach-
ment Clause by Congress supports the con-
clusion that an impeachable offense requires 
especially egregious conduct that threatens 
the constitutional order and, specifically, 
that it requires a violation of established 
law. The extraordinary threshold required 
for impeachment is evidenced by the fact 
that, in over two centuries under our Con-
stitution, the House has impeached a Presi-
dent only twice. In each case, moreover, the 
Senate found the charges brought by the 
House insufficient to warrant removal from 
office. 
In addition, until now, even in the articles 
of impeachment that the Senate found insuf-
ficient, the House has never impeached a 
President on charges that did not include a 
violation of established law. President Clin-
ton was impeached on charges that included 
perjury and obstruction of justice, both felo-
nies under federal law.119 Similarly, in the 
near-impeachment of President Nixon, the 
articles of impeachment approved by the 
House Judiciary Committee included mul-
tiple violations of law.120 Article I alleged 
obstruction of justice.121 And Article II as-
serted numerous legal breaches.122 
The impeachment of Andrew Johnson 
proves the same point. In 1867, the House Ju-
diciary Committee recommended articles of 
impeachment against President Johnson. 
The articles, however, did not allege any vio-
lation of law. Largely as a result of that 
fact, the Committee could not secure ap-
proval for them from a majority of the 
House. The minority report from the Com-
mittee arguing against adoption of the arti-
cles of impeachment explained that ‘‘[t]he 
House of Representatives may impeach a 
civil officer, but it must be done according 
to law. It must be for some offence known to 
the law, and not created by the fancy of the 
members of the House.’’ 123 Rep. James F. 
Wilson argued the position of the minority 
report on the House floor, explaining that 
‘‘no civil officer of the United States can be 
lawfully impeached except for a crime or 
misdemeanor known to the law.’’ 124 As one 
historian has explained, ‘‘[t]he House had re-
fused to impeach Andrew Johnson . . . at 
least in part because many representatives 
did not believe he had committed a specific 
violation of law.’’ 125 It was only after Presi-
dent Johnson violated the Tenure of Office 
Act, a law passed by Congress, that he was 
successfully impeached.126 
Even if judicial impeachments have been 
based on charges that do not involve a crimi-
nal offense or violation of statute,127 that 
would provide no sound basis for diluting the 
standards for presidential impeachment. Tex-
tually, the Constitution’s Good Behavior 
Clause alters the standard for the impeach-
ment of judges.128 In addition, for all the rea-
sons outlined above, the President’s unique 
role in the constitutional structure sets him 
apart and warrants more rigorous standards 
for impeachment. ‘‘When Senators remove 
one of a thousand federal judges (or even one 
of nine justices), they are not transforming 
an entire branch of government. But that is 
exactly what happens when they oust Amer-
ica’s one and only President, in whom all ex-
ecutive power is vested by the first sentence 
of Article II.’’ 129 Unlike a presidential im-
peachment inquiry, impeachment of a fed-
eral judge ‘‘does not paralyze the Nation’’ or 
cast doubt on the direction of the country’s 
domestic and foreign policy.130
Similarly, 
‘‘[t]he grounds for the expulsion of the one 
person elected by the entire nation to pre-
side over the executive cannot be the same 
as those for one member of the almost four- 
thousand-member 
federal 
judiciary.’’ 131 
Thus, as then-Senator Biden recognized: 
‘‘The constitutional scholarship overwhelm-
ingly recognizes that the fundamental struc-
tural commitment to a separation of powers 
requires [the Senate] to view the President 
as different than a Federal judge.’’ 132 Indeed, 
‘‘our history establishes that, as applied, the 
constitutional standard for impeaching the 
President has been distinctive, and properly 
so.’’ 133 
C. The Senate Cannot Convict Unless It 
Finds that the House Managers Have 
Proved an Impeachable Offense Beyond a 
Reasonable Doubt 
Given the profound implications of remov-
ing a duly elected president from office, an 
exceptionally demanding standard of proof 
must apply in a presidential impeachment 
trial.134 Senators should convict on articles 
of impeachment against a President only if 
they find that the House Managers have car-
ried their burden of proving that the Presi-
dent committed an impeachable offense be-
yond a reasonable doubt. 
As Senator Russ Feingold recognized in 
the Clinton impeachment, ‘‘[i]n making a de-
cision of this magnitude, it is best not to err

at all. If we must err, however, we should err 
on the side of . . . respecting the will of the 
people.’’ 135 Democrat and Republican Sen-
ators alike applied the beyond a reasonable 
doubt standard during President Clinton’s 
impeachment trial.136 As Senator Barbara 
Mikulski put it then: ‘‘The U.S. Senate must 
not make the decision to remove a President 
based on a hunch that the charges may be 
true. The strength of our Constitution and 
the strength of our Nation dictate that [the 
Senate] 
be 
sure—beyond 
a 
reasonable 
doubt.’’ 137 
D. The Senate May Not Consider Allegations 
Not Charged in the Articles of Impeachment 
Under the Constitution, the House is given 
the ‘‘sole Power of Impeachment’’ and the 
Senate is given the ‘‘sole Power to try all 
Impeachments.’’ 138 An impeachment is lit-
erally a ‘‘charge’’ of particular wrong-
doing.139 Thus, under the division of respon-
sibility in the Constitution, the Senate can 
conduct a trial solely on the charges speci-
fied in articles of impeachment approved by 
a vote of the House and presented to the Sen-
ate. The Senate cannot expand the scope of 
a trial to consider mere assertions appearing 
in House reports that the House did not in-
clude in the articles of impeachment sub-
mitted to a vote. Similarly, House Managers 
trying the case in the Senate must be con-
fined to the specific conduct alleged in the 
Articles approved by the House. 
These restrictions follow both from the 
plain terms of the Constitution limiting the 
Senate to trying an ‘‘impeachment’’ framed 
by the House and from elementary principles 
of due process. ‘‘[T]he senator’s role is solely 
one of acting on the accusations (Articles of 
Impeachment) voted by the House of Rep-
resentatives. The Senate cannot lawfully 
find the president guilty of something not 
charged by the House, any more than a trial 
jury can find a defendant guilty of some-
thing not charged in the indictment.’’ 140 ‘‘No 
principle of procedural due process is more 
clearly established than that notice of the 
specific charge, and a chance to be heard in a 
trial of the issues raised by that charge, if de-
sired, are among the constitutional rights of 
every accused.’’ 141 As the Supreme Court has 
explained, it has been the rule for over 130 
years that ‘‘a court cannot permit a defend-
ant to be tried on charges that are not made 
in the indictment against him.’’ 142 Doing so 
is ‘‘fatal error.’’ 143 
Under the same principles of due process, 
the Senate must similarly refuse to consider 
any uncharged allegations as a basis for con-
viction. 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
House Democrats have focused these pro-
ceedings on a telephone conversation be-
tween 
President 
Trump 
and 
President 
Zelensky of Ukraine on July 25, 2019.144 At 
some unknown time shortly after that call, a 
staffer in the Intelligence Community (IC)— 
who had no first-hand knowledge of the 
call—approached 
the 
staff 
of 
Chairman 
Adam Schiff on the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) raising 
complaints about the call.145 Although it is 
known that Chairman Schiff’s staff provided 
the IC staffer some ‘‘guidance,’’ 146 the extent 
of the so-called whistleblower’s coordination 
with Chairman Schiff’s staff remains un-
known to this day. 
The IC staffer retained counsel, including 
an attorney who had announced just days 
after President Trump took office that he 
supported a ‘‘coup’’ and ‘‘rebellion’’ to re-
move the President from office.147 
On August 12, 2019, the IC staffer filed a 
complaint about the July 25 telephone call 
with the Inspector General of the IC.148 The 
Inspector General found that there was 
‘‘some indicia of an arguable political bias 
on the part of [the so-called whistleblower] 
in favor of a rival political candidate.’’ 149 
On September 24, 2019, Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi unilaterally announced at a press con-
ference that ‘‘the House of Representatives 
is moving forward with an official impeach-
ment inquiry’’ 150 based on the anonymous 
complaint about the July 25 telephone call. 
There was no vote by the House to authorize 
such an inquiry. 
On September 25, pursuant to a previous 
announcement,151 the President declassified 
and released the complete record of the July 
25 call.152 
On September 26, HPSCI held its first hear-
ing regarding the so-called whistleblower 
complaint.153 And just one week later, on Oc-
tober 3, Chairman Schiff began a series of se-
cret, closed-door hearings regarding the 
complaint.154 The President and his counsel 
were not permitted to participate in any of 
these proceedings. 
On October 31, after five weeks of hearings, 
House Democrats finally authorized an im-
peachment inquiry when the full House 
voted to approve House Resolution 660.155 By 
its terms, the Resolution did not purport to 
retroactively authorize investigative efforts 
before October 31.156 
On November 13, HPSCI held the first of 
seven public hearings featuring some of the 
witnesses who had already testified in secret. 
At this stage, too, the President and his 
counsel were denied any opportunity to par-
ticipate. HPSCI released a report on Decem-
ber 3, 2019.157 
On December 4, the House Judiciary Com-
mittee held its first hearing, which featured 
four law professors, three of whom were se-
lected by Democrats.158 
The next day, December 5, Speaker Pelosi 
announced the outcome of the Judiciary 
Committee’s proceedings and directed Chair-
man Jerrold Nadler to draft articles of im-
peachment.159 
On December 9, four days after Speaker 
Pelosi announced that articles of impeach-
ment would be drafted, the Judiciary Com-
mittee held its second and last hearing, 
which featured presentations solely from 
staff members from HPSCI and the Judiciary 
Committee.160
The House Judiciary Com-
mittee did not hear from any fact witnesses 
at any time. 
On December 10, Chairman Jerrold Nadler 
offered two articles of impeachment for the 
Judiciary Committee’s consideration,161 and 
the Committee approved the articles on De-
cember 13 on a party-line vote.162 
On December 18, a mere 85 days after the 
press conference purportedly launching the 
inquiry, House Democrats completed the 
fastest presidential impeachment inquiry in 
history and adopted the Articles of Impeach-
ment over bipartisan opposition.163 
House Democrats justified their unseemly 
haste by claiming they had to move forward 
‘‘without 
delay’’ 
because 
the 
President 
would allegedly ‘‘continue to threaten the 
Nation’s security, democracy, and constitu-
tional system if he is allowed to remain in 
office.’’ 164 In a remarkable reversal, how-
ever, as soon as they had voted, they decided 
that there was no urgency at all. House 
Democrats took a leisurely four weeks to 
complete the ministerial act of transmitting 
the articles to the Senate—more than three 
times longer than the entire length of pro-
ceedings before the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
The Senate now has the ‘‘sole Power to 
try’’ the Articles of Impeachment trans-
mitted by the House.165 
THE ARTICLES SHOULD BE REJECTED AND THE 
PRESIDENT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE ACQUIT-
TED. 
I. The Articles Fail to State Impeachable Of-
fenses as a Matter Of Law. 
A. 
House 
Democrats’ 
Novel 
Theory 
of 
‘‘Abuse of Power’’ Does Not State an Im-
peachable Offense and Would Do Lasting 
Damage to the Separation of Powers 
House Democrats’ novel conception of 
‘‘abuse of power’’ as a supposedly impeach-
able offense is constitutionally defective. It 
supplants the Framers’ standard of ‘‘high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ 166 with a made- 
up theory that the President can be im-
peached and removed from office under an 
amorphous and undefined standard of ‘‘abuse 
of power.’’ The Framers adopted a standard 
that requires a violation of established law 
to state an impeachable offense. By contrast, 
in their Articles of Impeachment, House 
Democrats have not even attempted to iden-
tify any law that was violated. Moreover, 
House Democrats’ theory in this case rests 
on the radical assertion that the President 
could be impeached and removed from office 
entirely for his subjective motives—that is, for 
undertaking permissible actions for sup-
posedly ‘‘forbidden reasons.’’ 167 That unprec-
edented test is so flexible it would vastly ex-
pand the impeachment power beyond con-
stitutional limits and would permanently 
weaken the Presidency by effectively per-
mitting impeachments based on policy dis-
agreements. 
House Democrats cannot salvage their un-
precedented ‘‘abuse of power’’ standard with 
fuzzy claims that the Framers particularly 
intended impeachment to address ‘‘foreign 
entanglements’’ and ‘‘corruption of elec-
tions.’’ 168 Those assertions are makeweights 
that distort history and add no legitimacy to 
the radical theory of impeachment based on 
subjective motive alone. 
Under the Constitution, impeachable of-
fenses must be defined under established law. 
And they must be based on objective wrong-
doing, 
not 
supposed 
subjective 
motives 
dreamt up by a hostile faction in the House 
and superimposed onto a President’s entirely 
lawful conduct. 
1. House Democrats’ Novel Theory of ‘‘Abuse 
of Power’’ as an Impeachable Offense Sub-
verts Constitutional Standards and Would 
Permanently Weaken the Presidency 
House Democrats’ theory that the Presi-
dent can be impeached and removed from of-
fice under a vaguely defined concept of 
‘‘abuse of power’’ would vastly expand the 
impeachment power beyond the limits set by 
the Constitution and should be rejected by 
the Senate. 
(a) House Democrats’ made-up ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ standard fails to state an impeach-
able offense because it does not rest on vio-
lation of an established law 
House Democrats’ claim that the Senate 
can remove a President from office for run-
ning afoul of some ill-defined conception of 
‘‘abuse of power’’ finds no support in the text 
or history of the Impeachment Clause. As ex-
plained above,169 by limiting impeachment to 
cases of ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors,’’ 170 the Framers 
restricted impeachment to specific offenses 
against 
‘‘already 
known 
and 
established 
law.’’ 171
That was a deliberate choice de-
signed to constrain the power of impeach-
ment.172
Restricting impeachment to of-
fenses established by law provided a crucial 
protection for the independence of the Exec-
utive from what James Madison called the 
‘‘impetuous vortex’’ of legislative power.173 
As many constitutional scholars have recog-
nized, ‘‘the Framers were far more concerned 
with protecting the presidency from the en-
croachments of Congress . . . than they were

with 
the 
potential 
abuse 
of 
executive 
power.’’ 174
The impeachment power nec-
essarily implicated that concern. If the 
power were too expansive, the Framers 
feared that the Legislative Branch may 
‘‘hold [impeachments] as a rod over the Ex-
ecutive and by that means effectually de-
stroy his independence.’’ 175 One key voice at 
the Constitutional Convention, Gouverneur 
Morris, warned that, as they crafted a mech-
anism to make the President ‘‘amenable to 
Justice,’’ the Framers ‘‘should take care to 
provide some mode that will not make him 
dependent on the Legislature.’’ 176 To limit 
the impeachment power, Morris argued that 
only ‘‘few’’ ‘‘offences . . . ought to be im-
peachable,’’ and the ‘‘cases ought to be enu-
merated & defined.’’ 177 
Indeed, the debates over the text of the Im-
peachment Clause particularly reveal the 
Framers’ concern that ill-defined standards 
could give free rein to Congress to utilize im-
peachment to undermine the Executive. As 
explained above,178
when ‘‘maladministra-
tion’’ was proposed as a ground for impeach-
ment, it was rejected based on Madison’s 
concern that ‘‘[s]o vague a term will be 
equivalent to a tenure during [the] pleasure 
of the Senate.’’ 179 Madison rightly feared 
that a nebulous standard could allow Con-
gress to use impeachment against a Presi-
dent based merely on policy differences, 
making it function like a parliamentary no- 
confidence vote. That would cripple the inde-
pendent Executive the Framers had crafted 
and recreate the Parliamentary system they 
had expressly rejected. Circumscribing the 
impeachment power to reach only existing, 
defined offenses guarded against such misuse 
of the authority.180 
As Luther Martin, who had been a delegate 
at the Constitutional Convention, summa-
rized the point at the impeachment trial of 
Justice Samuel Chase in 1804, ‘‘[a]dmit that 
the House of Representatives have a right to 
impeach for acts which are not contrary to 
law, and that thereon the Senate may con-
vict and the officer be removed, you leave 
your judges and all your other officers at the 
mercy of the prevailing party.’’ 181 The Fram-
ers prevented that dangerous result by lim-
iting impeachment to defined offenses under 
the law. 
House Democrats cannot reconcile their 
amorphous ‘‘abuse of power’’ standard with 
the constitutional text simply by asserting 
that, ‘‘[t]o the founding generation, abuse of 
power 
was 
a 
specific, 
well-defined 
of-
fense.’’ 182 In fact, they conspicuously fail to 
provide any citation for that assertion. No-
where have they identified any contempora-
neous definition delimiting this purportedly 
‘‘well-defined’’ offense. 
Nor can House Democrats shore up their 
theory by invoking English practice.183 Ac-
cording to House Democrats, 400 years of 
parliamentary history suggests that the par-
ticular offenses charged in English impeach-
ments can be abstracted into several cat-
egories of offenses, including one involving 
abuse of power.184 From there, they jump to 
the conclusion that ‘‘abuse of power’’ itself 
can be treated as an offense and that any 
fact pattern that could be described as show-
ing abuse of power can be treated as an im-
peachable offense. But that entire method-
ology is antithetical to the approach the 
Framers took in defining the impeachment 
power. The Framers sought to confine im-
peachable offenses within known bounds to 
protect the Executive from arbitrary exer-
cises of power by Congress. Indeed, the 
Framers expressly rejected vague standards 
such as ‘‘maladministration’’ that had been 
used in England in order to constrain the im-
peachment power within defined limits. De-
riving 
general 
categories 
from 
ancient 
English cases and using those categories as 
the labels for new, more nebulously defined 
purported ‘‘offenses’’ is precisely counter to 
the Framers’ approach. As the Republican 
minority on the House Judiciary Committee 
in the Nixon impeachment inquiry ex-
plained, ‘‘[t]he whole tenor of the Framers’ 
discussions, the whole purpose of their many 
careful departures from English impeach-
ment practice, was in the direction of limits 
and of standards.’’ 185 
House Democrats’ theory also has no 
grounding in the history of presidential im-
peachments. Until now, the House of Rep-
resentatives has never impeached a President 
of the United States without alleging a vio-
lation of law—indeed, a crime. The articles 
of impeachment against President Clinton 
specified charges of perjury and obstruction 
of justice, both felonies under federal law.186 
In the Nixon impeachment inquiry, the arti-
cles approved by the House Judiciary Com-
mittee accused the President of obstructing 
justice, among multiple other violations of 
the law.187 And as explained above,188 the im-
peachment of President Johnson provides 
the clearest evidence that a presidential im-
peachment requires alleged violations of ex-
isting law. When the House Judiciary Com-
mittee recommended impeaching Johnson in 
1867 based on allegations that included no 
violations of law, the House rejected the rec-
ommendation.189 A majority in the House 
was persuaded by the arguments of the mi-
nority on the Judiciary Committee, who ar-
gued that ‘‘[t]he House of Representatives 
may impeach a civil officer, but it must be 
done according to law. It must be for some of-
fence known to the law, and not created by 
the fancy of the members of the House.’’ 190 
Congress did not impeach President Johnson 
until the following year, when he was im-
peached for violating the Tenure of Office 
Act.191 The history of presidential impeach-
ments provides no support for House Demo-
crats’ vague ‘‘abuse of power’’ charge. 
(b) House Democrats’ unprecedented theory 
of impeachable offenses defined by subjec-
tive intent alone would permanently weak-
en the presidency 
House Democrats’ conception of ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ is especially dangerous because it 
rests on the even more radical claim that a 
President can be impeached and removed 
from office solely for doing something he is 
allowed to do, if he did it for the ‘‘wrong’’ 
subjective reasons. Under this view, impeach-
ment can turn entirely on ‘‘whether the 
President’s real reasons, the ones actually in 
his mind at the time, were legitimate.’’ 192 
That standard is so malleable that it would 
permit a partisan House—like this one—to 
attack virtually any presidential decision by 
questioning a President’s motives. By elimi-
nating any requirement for wrongful con-
duct, House Democrats have tried to make 
thinking the wrong thoughts an impeachable 
offense. 
House Democrats’ theory of impeachment 
based on subjective motive alone is unwork-
able and constitutionally impermissible. 
First, by making impeachment turn on 
nearly impossible inquiries into the subjec-
tive intent behind entirely lawful conduct, 
House Democrats’ standard would open vir-
tually every presidential decision to partisan 
attack based on questioning a President’s 
motives. As courts have repeatedly observed, 
‘‘[i]nquiry into the motives of elected offi-
cials can be both difficult and undesirable, 
and such inquiry should be avoided when 
possible.’’ 193 Thus, for example, courts will 
not invalidate laws within Congress’s con-
stitutional authority based on allegations 
about legislators’ motives.194
As constitu-
tional historian Raoul Berger has observed, 
this principle ‘‘is equally applicable to exec-
utive action within statutory or constitu-
tional limits.’’ 195
Even House Democrats’ 
own expert, Professor Michael Gerhardt, has 
previously 
explained 
(in 
defending 
the 
Obama Administration against charges of 
abuse of power) that ‘‘the President has the 
ability to . . . strongly push back against 
any inquiry into either the motivations or 
support for his actions.’’ 196 
The Framers did not intend to expand the 
impeachment power infinitely by allowing 
Congress to attack objectively lawful presi-
dential conduct based solely on unwieldy in-
quiries into subjective intent. Under the 
Framers’ plan, impeachment was intended to 
apply to objective wrongdoing as identified by 
offenses defined under existing law. As noted 
above, the Framers rejected maladministra-
tion as a ground for impeachment precisely 
because it was ‘‘[s]o vague a term.’’ 197 In-
stead, they settled on ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors,’’ 198 as a term with a ‘‘limited 
and technical meaning.’’ 199 ‘‘[H]igh Crimes 
and Misdemeanors,’’ as well as ‘‘Treason’’ 
and 
‘‘Bribery,’’ 200
all 
denote 
objectively 
wrongful conduct as defined by existing law. 
Each of the seven other references in the 
Constitution to impeachment also supports 
the conclusion that impeachments must be 
evaluated in terms of offenses against set-
tled law: The Constitution refers to ‘‘Convic-
tion’’ for impeachable offenses twice 201 and 
‘‘Judgment in Cases of Impeachment.’’ 202 It 
directs the Senate to ‘‘try all Impeach-
ments’’ 203 and requires the Chief Justice’s 
participation 
when 
the 
President 
is 
‘‘tried.’’ 204 And it implies impeachable of-
fenses are ‘‘Crimes’’ and ‘‘Offenses’’ in the 
Jury Trial Clause and the Pardon Clause, re-
spectively.205 These are all words that indi-
cate violations of established law. The Fram-
ers’ words limited the impeachment power 
and, in particular, sought to ensure that im-
peachment could not be used to attack a 
President based on mere policy differences. 
Given their apprehensions about misuse of 
the impeachment power, it is inconceivable 
that the Framers crafted a purely intent- 
based impeachment standard. Such a stand-
ard would be so vague and malleable that en-
tirely permissible actions could lead to im-
peachment of a President (and potentially 
removal from office) based solely on a hos-
tile Congress’s assessment of the President’s 
subjective motives. If that were the rule, any 
President’s political opponents could take 
virtually any of his actions, mischaracterize 
his motives after the fact, and misuse im-
peachment as a tool for political opposition 
instead of as a safeguard against egregious 
presidential misconduct.206 As Republicans 
on the House Judiciary Committee during 
the Nixon impeachment inquiry rightly ex-
plained, ‘‘[a]n impeachment power exercised 
without extrinsic and objective standards 
would be tantamount to the use of bills of 
attainder and ex post facto laws, which are 
expressly forbidden by the Constitution and 
are contrary to the American spirit of jus-
tice.’’ 207 
House Democrats justify their focus on 
subjective motives based largely on a cherry- 
picked snippet from a statement James 
Iredell made in the North Carolina ratifica-
tion debates.208 Iredell observed that ‘‘the 
President would be liable to impeachment 
[if] . . . he had acted from some corrupt mo-
tive or other.’’ 209 But nothing in that general 
statement suggests that Iredell—let alone 
the Framers or the hundreds of delegates 
who ratified the Constitution in the states— 
subscribed to House Democrats’ current the-
ory treating impeachment as a roving li-
cense for Congress to attack a President’s 
lawful actions based on subjective motive 
alone. To the contrary, in the very same 
speech, Iredell himself warned against the 
dangers of allowing impeachment based on 
assessments of subjective motive. He ex-
plained that there would often be divisions

between political parties and that, due to a 
lack of ‘‘charity,’’ each might often ‘‘at-
tribute every opposition’’ to its own views 
‘‘to an ill motive.’’ 210 In that environment, 
he warned, ‘‘[a] mere difference of opinion 
might be interpreted, by the malignity of 
party, into a deliberate, wicked action.’’ 211 
That, he argued, should not be a basis for im-
peachment.212 
House Democrats’ assertions that past 
presidential impeachments provide support 
for their made-up impeachment-based-on- 
subjective-motives-alone 
theory 
are 
also 
wrong.213 Contrary to their claims, neither 
the Nixon impeachment inquiry nor the im-
peachment of President Johnson supports 
their assertions. 
In the Nixon impeachment inquiry, none of 
the articles recommended by the House Judi-
ciary Committee was labeled ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ or framed the charge in those terms. 
And it is simply wrong to say that the the-
ory underlying the proposed articles was 
that President Nixon had taken permissible 
actions with the wrong subjective motives. 
Article I alleged President Nixon obstructed 
justice, a clear violation of law.214 And Arti-
cle II asserted numerous breaches of the law. 
It claimed that President Nixon ‘‘violat[ed] 
the 
constitutional 
rights 
of 
citizens,’’ 
‘‘contraven[ed] the laws governing agencies 
of the executive branch,’’ and ‘‘authorized 
and permitted to be maintained a secret in-
vestigative unit within the office of the 
President . . . which unlawfully utilized the 
resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, 
[and] engaged in covert and unlawful activi-
ties.’’ 215 Those allegations did not turn on 
describing permissible conduct that had sim-
ply been done with the wrong subjective mo-
tives.216 Instead, they charged unlawful con-
duct.217 
House Democrats’ reliance on the Johnson 
impeachment fares no better. According to 
House Democrats, the Johnson impeachment 
supports 
their 
concocted 
impeachment- 
based-on-subjective-motives 
theory 
under 
the following tortured logic: The articles of 
impeachment actually adopted by the House 
charged the violation of the Tenure of Office 
Act.218 But that was not the ‘‘real’’ reason 
the House sought to remove President John-
son. The real reason was that he had under-
mined Reconstruction. And, in House Demo-
crats’ view, his improper desire to thwart 
Reconstruction was actually a better reason 
to impeach him.219 For support, House Demo-
crats cite a recent book co-authored by one 
of their own staffers (Joshua Matz) and Lau-
rence Tribe.220 This is nonsense. Nothing in 
the Johnson impeachment involved charging 
the President with taking objectively per-
missible action for the wrong subjective rea-
sons. Johnson was impeached for violating a 
law passed by Congress.221 Moreover, Presi-
dent Johnson was acquitted, despite what-
ever subjective motives he might have had. 
House Democrats cannot conjure a precedent 
out of thin air by simply imagining that the 
Johnson impeachment articles said some-
thing other than what they said.222 
If the Johnson impeachment established 
any precedent relevant here, it is that the 
House refused to impeach the President until 
he clearly violated the letter of the law. As 
one historian has explained, despite wide-
spread 
anger 
among 
Republicans 
about 
President Johnson’s actions undermining 
Reconstruction, until Johnson violated the 
Tenure of Office Act, ‘‘[t]he House had re-
fused to impeach [him] . . . at least in part 
because many representatives did not believe 
he had committed a specific violation of 
law.’’ 223 
Second, House Democrats’ theory raises 
particular dangers because it makes ‘‘per-
sonal political benefit’’ one of the ‘‘forbidden 
reasons’’ for taking government action.224 
Under that standard, a President could po-
tentially be impeached and removed from of-
fice for taking any action with his political 
interests in view. In a representative democ-
racy, however, elected officials almost al-
ways consider the effect that their conduct 
might have on the next election. And there 
is nothing wrong with that. 
By making ‘‘personal political gain’’ an il-
licit motive for official action, House Demo-
crats’ radical theory of impeachment would 
permit a partisan Congress to remove vir-
tually any President by questioning the ex-
tent to which his or her action was moti-
vated by electoral considerations rather 
than the ‘‘right’’ policy motivation. None of 
this has any basis in the constitutional text, 
which specifies particular offenses as im-
peachable conduct. Just as importantly, 
under such a rule, impeachments would turn 
on unanswerable questions that ultimately 
reduce to policy disputes—exactly what the 
Framers saw as an impermissible basis for 
impeachment. For example, if it is impeach-
able conduct to act with too much of a view 
toward electoral results, how much of a 
focus on electoral results is too much, even 
assuming that Congress could accurately 
disaggregate a President’s actual motives? 
And how does one measure presidential mo-
tives against some unknowable standard of 
the ‘‘right’’ policy result uninfluenced by 
considerations of political gain? That ques-
tion, of course, quickly boils down to noth-
ing more than a dispute about the ‘‘right’’ 
policy in the first place. None of this pro-
vides any permissible basis for impeaching a 
President. 
Third, aptly demonstrating why all of this 
leads to unconstitutional results, House 
Democrats have invented standards for iden-
tifying supposedly illicit presidential mo-
tives that turn the Constitution upside 
down. According to House Democrats, they 
can show that President Trump acted with 
illicit motives because, in their view, the 
President supposedly ‘‘disregarded United 
States foreign policy towards Ukraine,’’ 225 
ignored the ‘‘official policy’’ 226 that he had 
been briefed on, and ‘‘ignored, defied, and 
confounded every agency within the Execu-
tive 
Branch’’ 
with 
his 
decisions 
on 
Ukraine.227 These assertions are preposterous 
and dangerous. They fundamentally mis-
understand the assignment of power under 
the Constitution. 
Article II of the Constitution states that 
‘‘the executive Power shall be vested in a 
President’’—not Executive Branch staff.228 
The vesting of the Executive Power in the 
President makes him ‘‘the sole organ of the 
nation in its external relations, and its sole 
representative with foreign nations.’’ 229 He 
sets foreign policy for the Nation, and in 
‘‘this vast external realm,’’ the ‘‘President 
alone has the power to speak . . . as a rep-
resentative of the nation.’’ 230 The Constitu-
tion assigns him control over foreign policy 
precisely to ensure that the Nation speaks 
with one voice.231 His decisions are authori-
tative regardless of the judgments of the 
unelected bureaucrats participating in an 
inter-agency process that exists solely to fa-
cilitate his decisions, not to make decisions 
for him. Any theory of an impeachable of-
fense that turns on ferreting out supposedly 
‘‘constitutionally 
improper’’ 
motives 
by 
measuring the President’s policy decisions 
against a purported ‘‘interagency consensus’’ 
formed by unelected staff is a transparent 
and impermissible inversion of the constitu-
tional structure. 
It requires no leap of imagination to see 
the absurd consequences that would follow 
from House Democrats’ theory. Imagine a 
President who, in an election year, deter-
mined to withdraw troops from an overseas 
deployment to have them home by Christ-
mas. Should hostile lawmakers be able to 
seek impeachment and claim proof of ‘‘illicit 
motive’’ because an alleged ‘‘interagency 
consensus’’ showed that the ‘‘real’’ national 
security interests of the United States re-
quired keeping those troops in place? Manu-
facturing an impeachment out of such an as-
sertion ought to be dismissed out of hand. 
House Democrats’ abuse-of-power theory is 
also profoundly anti-democratic. In assign-
ing the Executive Power to the President, 
the Constitution ensures that power is exer-
cised by a person who is democratically re-
sponsible to the people through a quadren-
nial election.232 This ensures that the people 
themselves will regularly and frequently 
have a say in the direction of the Nation’s 
policy, including foreign policy. As a result, 
removing a President on the ground that his 
foreign policy decisions were allegedly based 
on ‘‘illicit motives’’—because they failed to 
conform to a purported ‘‘consensus’’ of ca-
reer bureaucrats—would fundamentally sub-
vert the democratic principles at the core of 
our Constitution. 
This very impeachment shows how anti- 
democratic House Democrats’ theory really 
is. Millions of Americans voted for President 
Trump precisely because he promised to dis-
rupt the foreign policy status quo. He prom-
ised a new, ‘‘America First’’ foreign policy 
that many in the Washington establishment 
derided. And the President has delivered, 
bringing fresh and successful approaches to 
foreign policy in a host of areas, including 
relations with NATO, China, Israel, and 
North Korea. In particular, with respect to 
Ukraine and elsewhere, his foreign policy has 
focused on ensuring that America does not 
shoulder a disproportionate burden for var-
ious international missions, that other coun-
tries do their fair share, and that taxpayer 
dollars are not squandered. House Demo-
crats’ theory that a purported inter-agency 
‘‘consensus’’ among career bureaucrats can 
be used to show improper motive is an af-
front to the tens of millions of American 
citizens who voted for President Trump’s for-
eign policy and not a continuation of the 
Washington 
establishment’s 
policy 
pref-
erences. 
2. House Democrats’ assertions that the 
framers particularly intended impeach-
ment to guard against ‘‘foreign entangle-
ments’’ and ‘‘corruption’’ of elections are 
makeweights that distort history 
House Democrats try to shore up their 
made-up theory of abuse of power by pre-
tending that anything related to what they 
call ‘‘foreign entanglements’’ or elections 
strikes at the core of impeachment.233 This 
novel accounting of the concerns animating 
the impeachment power conveniently allows 
House Democrats to claim that their allega-
tions just happen to raise the perfect storm 
of impeachable conduct, as if their accusa-
tions show that ‘‘President Trump has real-
ized the Framers’ worst nightmare.’’ 234 That 
is preposterous on its face. The Framers 
were concerned about the possibility of trea-
son and the danger that foreign princes with 
vast treasuries at their disposal might actu-
ally buy off the Chief Executive of a fledg-
ling, debt-ridden republic situated on the 
seaboard of a vast wilderness continent— 
most of which was still claimed by European 
powers eager to advance their imperial inter-
ests. Their worst nightmare was not the 
President of the United States-as-superpower 
having an innocuous conversation with the 
leader of a comparatively small European re-
public and disclosing the conversation for all 
Americans to see. 
To peddle their distortion of history, 
House Democrats cobble together snippets 
from the Framers’ discussions on various dif-
ferent subjects and try to portray them as if

they define the contours of impeachable of-
fenses. As explained above, the Framers in-
tended a limited impeachment power. But 
when House Democrats find the Framers 
raising concerns about any risks to the new 
government, they leap to the conclusion that 
those concerns must identify impeachable 
offenses. Such transparently results-driven 
historical analysis is baseless and provides 
no support for House Democrats’ drive to re-
move the President. 
First, House Democrats mangle history in 
offering ‘‘foreign entanglements’’ as a type 
of impeachable offense. Their approach con-
fuses two different concepts—entangling the 
country in alliances and fears of foreign gov-
ernments buying influence—to create a false 
impression that there is something insidious 
about anything involving a foreign connec-
tion that should make it a particularly ripe 
ground for impeachment. 
When the Framers spoke about foreign 
‘‘entanglements’’ they had a particular dan-
ger in mind. That was the danger of the 
young country becoming ensnared in alli-
ances that would draw it into conflicts be-
tween European powers. When President 
Washington asserted that ‘‘history and expe-
rience prove that foreign influence is one of 
the most baneful foes of republican govern-
ment,’’ he was not warning about Chief Ex-
ecutives meriting removal from office.235 He 
was advocating for neutrality in American 
foreign policy, and in particular, with re-
spect to Europe.236 One of President Wash-
ington’s most controversial decisions was es-
tablishing American neutrality in the esca-
lating war between Great Britain and revolu-
tionary France.237 He then used his Farewell 
Address 
to 
argue 
against 
‘‘entangl[ing] 
[American] peace and prosperity in the toils 
of European ambition, rivalship, interest, 
humor [and] caprice.’’ 238 Again, he was warn-
ing about the United States being drawn into 
foreign alliances that would trap the young 
country in disputes between European pow-
ers. House Democrats’ false allegations here 
have nothing to do with the danger of a for-
eign entanglement as the Founders under-
stood that term, and the admonitions from 
the Founding era they cite are irrelevant.239 
The Framers were also concerned about 
the distinct problem of foreign attempts to 
interfere in the governance of the United 
States.240 But on that score, they identified 
particular concerns based on historical ex-
amples and addressed them specifically. 
They were concerned about officials being 
bought off by foreign powers. Gouverneur 
Morris articulated this concern: ‘‘Our Execu-
tive . . . may be bribed by a greater interest 
to betray his trust; and no one would say 
that we ought to expose ourselves to the dan-
ger of seeing the first Magistrate in foreign 
pay without being able to guard [against] it 
by displacing him.’’ 241 He specifically men-
tioned the bribe King Louis XIV of France 
had paid to King Charles II of England to in-
fluence English policy.242 This is why ‘‘Brib-
ery’’ and ‘‘Treason’’ were made impeachable 
offenses. The Framers also addressed the 
danger of foreign inducements directed at 
the President by barring his acceptance of 
‘‘any present, Emolument, Office, or Title’’ 
in the Foreign Emoluments Clause.243 House 
Democrats’ Articles of Impeachment make 
no allegations under any of these specific of-
fenses identified in the Constitution. 
In the end, House Democrats’ ahistorical 
arguments rest on a non sequitur. They es-
sentially argue that because the Framers 
showed concern about the Nation being be-
trayed in these specific provisions, any accu-
sations that relate to foreign influence must 
equally amount to impeachable conduct. 
That simply does not follow. To the con-
trary, since the Framers made specific provi-
sions for the types of foreign interference 
they feared, there is no reason to think that 
the Impeachment Clause must be stretched 
and contorted to reach other conduct simply 
because it has to do with something foreign. 
The Framers’ approach to treason, in par-
ticular, suggests that House Democrats’ 
logic is wrong. The Framers defined treason 
in the Constitution to limit it.244 Nothing 
about their concern for limiting treason sug-
gests that a general concern about foreign 
betrayal should be used as a ratchet to ex-
pand the scope of the Impeachment Clause 
and make it infinitely malleable so that all 
charges cast in the vague language of ‘‘for-
eign entanglements’’ should automatically 
state impeachable conduct. 
Second, House Democrats point to the 
Founders’ concerns that a President might 
bribe electors to stay in office.245 But that 
specific concern does not mean, as they 
claim, that anything to do with an election 
was a central concern of impeachment and 
that impeachment is the tool the Framers 
created to deal with it. The historical evi-
dence shows the Framers had a specific con-
cern with presidential candidates bribing 
members of the Electoral College.246 That 
concern was addressed by the clear terms of 
the Constitution, which made ‘‘Bribery’’ a 
basis for impeachment.247 Nothing in House 
Democrats’ sources suggests that simply be-
cause one grave form of corruption related to 
elections became a basis for impeachment, 
then any accusations of any sort related to 
elections necessarily must fall within the 
ambit of impeachable conduct. That is sim-
ply an invention of the House Democrats. 
B. House Democrats’ Charge of ‘‘Obstruc-
tion’’ Fails Because Invoking Constitu-
tionally Based Privileges and Immunities 
to Protect the Separation of Powers Is Not 
an Impeachable Offense 
House Democrats’ charge of ‘‘obstruction’’ 
is both frivolous and dangerous. At the out-
set, the very suggestion that President 
Trump has somehow ‘‘obstructed’’ Congress 
is preposterous. The President has been ex-
traordinarily transparent about his inter-
actions with President Zelensky. Imme-
diately after questions arose, President 
Trump took the unprecedented step of de-
classifying and releasing the full record of 
his July 25 telephone call, and he later re-
leased the transcript of an April 21, 2019 call 
as well. It is well settled that the President 
has a virtually absolute right to maintain 
the confidentiality of his diplomatic commu-
nications with foreign leaders.248 And keep-
ing such communications confidential is es-
sential for the effective conduct of diplo-
macy, because it ensures that foreign leaders 
will be willing to talk candidly with the 
President. Nevertheless, after weighing such 
concerns, the President determined that 
complete transparency was important in this 
case, and he released both call records so 
that the American people could judge for 
themselves exactly what he said to the 
President of Ukraine. That should have put 
an end to this inquiry before it began. The 
President was not ‘‘obstructing’’ when he 
freely released the central piece of evidence 
in this case. 
The President also was not ‘‘obstructing’’ 
when he rightly decided to defend estab-
lished Executive Branch confidentiality in-
terests, rooted in the separation of powers, 
against unauthorized efforts to rummage 
through Executive Branch files and to de-
mand testimony from some of the Presi-
dent’s closest advisers. As the Supreme 
Court has explained, the privilege protecting 
the confidentiality of presidential commu-
nications ‘‘is fundamental to the operation 
of Government and inextricably rooted in 
the separation of powers under the Constitu-
tion.’’ 249 For future occupants of the Office 
of President, it was essential for the Presi-
dent, like past occupants of the Office, to 
protect Executive Branch confidentiality 
against House Democrats’ overreaching in-
trusions. 
The President’s proper concern for requir-
ing the House to proceed by lawful measures 
and for protecting long-settled Executive 
Branch confidentiality interests cannot be 
twisted into an impeachable offense. To the 
contrary, House Democrats’ charge of ‘‘ob-
struction’’ comes nowhere close to the con-
stitutional standard. It does not charge any 
violation of established law. More impor-
tant, it is based on the fundamentally mis-
taken premise that the President can be re-
moved from office for invoking established 
legal defenses and immunities against defec-
tive subpoenas from House committees. 
The President does not commit ‘‘obstruc-
tion’’ by asserting legal rights and privi-
leges.250 And House Democrats turn the law 
on its head with their unprecedented claim 
that it is ‘‘obstruction’’ for anyone to assert 
rights that might require the House to try to 
establish the validity of its subpoenas in 
court.251 House Democrats’ radical theories 
are especially misplaced where, as here, the 
legal principles invoked by the President and 
other Administration officials are critical 
for preserving the separation of powers—and 
based on advice from the Department of Jus-
tice’s Office of Legal Counsel. 
Treating a disagreement regarding con-
stitutional limits on the House’s authority 
to compel documents or testimony as an im-
peachable offense would do permanent dam-
age to the Constitution’s separation of pow-
ers and our structure of government. It 
would allow the House of Representatives to 
declare itself supreme and turn any disagree-
ment with the Executive over informational 
demands into a purported basis for removing 
the President from office. As Professor 
Turley has explained, ‘‘Basing impeachment 
on this obstruction theory would itself be an 
abuse of power . . . by Congress’’ 252 
1. President Trump acted properly—and upon 
advice from the Department of Justice—by 
asserting established legal defenses and 
immunities to resist legally defective de-
mands for information from House com-
mittees 
House Democrats’ purported ‘‘obstruction’’ 
charge is based on three actions by the 
President or Executive Branch officials act-
ing under his authority, each of which was 
entirely proper and taken only after securing 
advice from OLC. 
(a) Administration officials properly refused 
to comply with subpoenas that lacked au-
thorization from the House 
It was entirely proper for Administration 
officials to decline to comply with subpoenas 
issued pursuant to a purported ‘‘impeach-
ment inquiry’’ before the House of Rep-
resentatives had authorized any such in-
quiry. No House committee can issue sub-
poenas pursuant to the House’s impeachment 
power without authorization from the House 
itself. On precisely that basis, OLC deter-
mined that all subpoenas issued before the 
adoption of House Resolution 660 on October 
31, 2019, purportedly to advance an ‘‘im-
peachment inquiry,’’ were unauthorized and 
invalid.253 Numerous witness subpoenas and 
all of the document subpoenas cited in Arti-
cle II are invalid for this reason alone. These 
invalid subpoenas imposed no legal obliga-
tion on the recipients, and it was entirely 
lawful for the recipients not to comply with 
them.254 The belated adoption of House Reso-
lution 660 on October 31 to authorize the in-
quiry essentially conceded that a vote was 
required and did nothing to remedy the in-
quiry’s invalid beginnings.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S322 
January 21, 2020 
(i) A delegation of authority from the House 
is required before any committee can in-
vestigate pursuant to the impeachment 
power 
No committee can exercise authority as-
signed by the Constitution to the House ab-
sent a clear delegation of authority from the 
House itself.255 The Constitution assigns the 
‘‘sole Power of Impeachment’’ 256
to the 
House as a chamber—not to individual Mem-
bers or subordinate units. Assessing the va-
lidity of a committee’s inquiry and sub-
poenas thus requires ‘‘constru[ing] the scope 
of the authority which the House of Rep-
resentatives gave to’’ the committee.257 
Where a committee cannot demonstrate that 
its inquiries have been authorized by an af-
firmative vote of the House assigning the 
committee authority, the committee’s ac-
tions are ultra vires, and its subpoenas have 
no force.258 
To pursue an ‘‘impeachment inquiry,’’ and 
to compel testimony and the production of 
documents for such an inquiry, the com-
mittee must be authorized to conduct an in-
quiry pursuant to the House’s impeachment 
power. That power is distinct from the power 
to legislate assigned to Congress in Article I, 
Section 1. Congress’s power to investigate in 
support of its power to legislate is limited to 
inquiring into topics ‘‘on which legislation 
could be had.’’ 259 An impeachment inquiry is 
not subject to the same constraint. An im-
peachment inquiry does not aid Congress in 
considering legislation, but instead requires 
reconstructing past events to examine the 
conduct of specific persons. That differs from 
the forward-looking nature of any legislative 
investigation.260 Given these differences, a 
committee seeking to investigate pursuant 
to the impeachment power must show that 
the House has actually authorized the com-
mittee to use that specific power. 
The Speaker of the House cannot treat the 
House’s constitutional power as her own to 
distribute to committees based on nothing 
more than her own say-so. That would exac-
erbate the danger of a minority faction in-
voking the power of impeachment to launch 
disruptive inquiries without any constitu-
tional legitimacy from a majority vote in 
the House. It would also permit a minority 
to seize the House’s formidable investigative 
powers to pursue divisive investigations for 
partisan purposes that a House majority 
might not be willing to authorize. House 
Democrats have not identified any credible 
support for their theory of authorization by 
press conference.261 
(ii) Nothing in existing House rules author-
ized any committee to pursue an impeach-
ment inquiry 
Nothing in the House Rules adopted at the 
beginning of this Congress delegated author-
ity to pursue an impeachment inquiry to any 
committee. In particular, Rule X, which de-
fines each committee’s jurisdiction, makes 
clear that it addresses only committees’ 
‘‘legislative 
jurisdiction’’—not 
impeach-
ment.262 Rule X does not assign any com-
mittee any authority whatsoever with re-
spect to impeachment. It does not even men-
tion impeachment. And that silence is not 
accidental. Rule X devotes more than 2,000 
words to describing the committees’ areas of 
jurisdiction in detail. The six committees 
that Speaker Pelosi instructed to take part 
in the purported impeachment inquiry here 
have their jurisdiction defined down to the 
most obscure legislative issues, ranging from 
the Judiciary Committee’s jurisdiction over 
‘‘[s]tate and territorial boundary lines’’ 263 to 
the Oversight Committee’s responsibility for 
‘‘[h]olidays and celebrations.’’ 264 But Rule X 
does not assign any committee authority re-
garding impeachment. Neither does Rule 
XI’s grant of specific investigative powers, 
such as the power to hold hearings and to 
issue subpoenas. Each committee’s specific 
investigative powers under Rule XI are re-
stricted to Rule X’s jurisdictional limits 265— 
which do not include impeachment.266 
Rule X’s history confirms that the absence 
of any reference to ‘‘impeachment’’ was de-
liberate. When the House considered a num-
ber of proposals between 1973 and 1974 to 
transfer power from the House to commit-
tees and to remake committee jurisdiction, 
the House specifically rejected an initial pro-
posal that would have added ‘‘impeach-
ments’’ to the Judiciary Committee’s juris-
diction.267 Instead, the House amended the 
rules to provide standing authorization for 
committees to use investigatory powers only 
pursuant to their legislative jurisdiction 268 
(previously, for example, a separate House 
vote was required to delegate subpoena au-
thority to a particular committee for a par-
ticular topic).269 Thus, after these amended 
rules were adopted, committees were able to 
begin investigations within their legislative 
jurisdiction and issue subpoenas without se-
curing House approval, but that resolution 
did not authorize self-initiated impeachment 
inquiries. Indeed, it was precisely because 
‘‘impeachment was not specifically included 
within the jurisdiction of the House Judici-
ary Committee’’ that then-Chairman Peter 
Rodino announced that the ‘‘Committee on 
the Judiciary will have to seek subpoena 
power from the House’’ for the Nixon im-
peachment inquiry.270 The House majority, 
minority, and Parliamentarian, as well as 
the Department of Justice, all agreed on this 
point.271 
(iii) More than 200 years of precedent con-
firm that the House must vote to begin an 
impeachment inquiry 
Historical practice confirms the need for a 
House vote to launch an impeachment in-
quiry. Since the Founding of the Republic, 
the House has never undertaken the solemn 
responsibility of a presidential impeachment 
inquiry without first authorizing a par-
ticular committee to begin the inquiry. That 
has also been the House’s nearly unbroken 
practice for every judicial impeachment for 
two hundred years. 
In every prior presidential impeachment 
inquiry, the House adopted a resolution ex-
plicitly authorizing the committee to con-
duct the investigation before any compul-
sory process was used.272 In President Clin-
ton’s impeachment, the House Judiciary 
Committee explained that the resolution was 
a constitutional requirement ‘‘[b]ecause im-
peachment is delegated solely to the House 
of Representatives by the Constitution’’ and 
thus ‘‘the full House of Representatives 
should be involved in critical decision mak-
ing regarding various stages of impeach-
ment.’’ 273
As 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
Chairman explained during President Nix-
on’s impeachment, an ‘‘authoriz[ation] . . . 
resolution has always been passed by the 
House’’ for an impeachment inquiry and ‘‘is 
a necessary step.’’ 274
Thus, he recognized 
that, without authorization from the House, 
‘‘the committee’s subpoena power [did] not 
now extend to impeachment.’’ 275
Indeed, 
with respect to impeachments of judges or 
lesser officers in the Executive Branch, the 
requirement that the full House pass a reso-
lution authorizing an impeachment inquiry 
traces back to the first impeachments under 
the Constitution.276 
That historical practice has continued into 
the modern era, in which there have been 
only three impeachments that did not begin 
with a House resolution authorizing an in-
quiry. Each of those three outliers involved 
impeachment of a lower court judge during a 
short interlude in the 1980s.277 Those outliers 
provide no precedent for a presidential im-
peachment. To paraphrase the Supreme 
Court, ‘‘when considered against 200 years of 
settled practice, we regard these few scat-
tered examples as anomalies.’’ 278 In addition, 
as explained above,279 ‘‘[t]he impeachment of 
a federal judge does not provide the same 
weighty considerations as the impeachment 
of a president.’’ 280 Setting aside these three 
outliers, precedent shows that a House vote 
is required to initiate an impeachment in-
quiry for judges and subordinate executive 
officials. At least the same level of process 
must be used to begin the far more serious 
process of inquiring into impeachment of the 
President. 
(iv) The Subpoenas Issued Before House Res-
olution 660 Were Invalid and Remain In-
valid Because the Resolution Did Not Rat-
ify Them 
The impeachment inquiry was unauthor-
ized and all the subpoenas issued by House 
committees in pursuit of the inquiry were 
therefore invalid. OLC reached the same con-
clusion.281 The vast bulk of the proceedings 
in the House were thus founded on the use of 
unlawful process to compel testimony. Until 
now, House Democrats have consistently 
agreed that a vote by the House is required 
to authorize an impeachment inquiry. In 
2016, House Democrats on the Judiciary 
Committee agreed that ‘‘[i]n the modern era, 
the impeachment process begins in the 
House of Representatives only after the 
House has voted to authorize the Judiciary 
Committee to investigate whether charges 
are warranted.’’ 282
As current Judiciary 
Committee member Rep. Hank Johnson said 
in 2016, ‘‘[t]he impeachment process cannot 
begin until the 435 Members of the House of 
Representatives adopt a resolution author-
izing the House Judiciary Committee to con-
duct an independent investigation.’’ 283
As 
Chairman Nadler put it, an impeachment in-
quiry without a House vote is ‘‘an obvious 
sham’’ and a ‘‘fake impeachment,’’ 284 or as 
House Manager Rep. Hakeem Jeffries ex-
plained, it is ‘‘a political charade,’’ ‘‘a 
sham,’’ and ‘‘a Hollywood-style produc-
tion.’’ 285 
These invalid subpoenas remain invalid 
today. House Resolution 660 merely directed 
the six investigating committees to ‘‘con-
tinue their ongoing investigations’’ 286 and 
did not even purport to ratify retroactively 
the nearly two dozen invalid subpoenas 
issued before it was adopted,287 as OLC has 
explained.288 The House knows how to use 
language effectuating ratification when it 
wants to—indeed, it used such language less 
than six months ago in a resolution that 
‘‘ratifie[d] . . . all subpoenas previously 
issued’’ by a committee.289 The omission of 
anything similar from House Resolution 660 
means that subpoenas issued before House 
Resolution 660 remain invalid, and the entire 
fact-gathering process pursuant to those sub-
poenas was ultra vires. 
Contrary to false claims from House Demo-
crats, the President did not ‘‘declare[] him-
self above impeachment,’’ reject ‘‘any efforts 
at accommodation or compromise,’’ or de-
clare ‘‘himself and his entire branch of gov-
ernment exempt from subpoenas issued by 
the House.’’ 290 The White House simply made 
clear that Administration officials should 
not participate in House Democrats’ inquiry 
‘‘under these circumstances’’—meaning a 
process that was unauthorized under the 
House’s own rules and suffered from the 
other serious defects.291
The President’s 
counsel also made it clear that, if the inves-
tigating committees sought to proceed under 
their oversight authorities, the White House 
stood ‘‘ready to engage in that process as [it] 
ha[s] in the past, in a manner consistent 
with well-established bipartisan constitu-
tional protections.’’ 292

Schiff and his colleagues who refused to en-
gage in any accommodation process with the 
White House. 
(b) The President Properly Asserted Immu-
nity of His Senior Advisers From Com-
pelled Congressional Testimony 
The President also properly directed his 
senior advisers not to testify in response to 
subpoenas.293 Those subpoenas suffered from 
a separate infirmity: they were unenforce-
able because the President’s senior advisers 
are immune from compelled testimony be-
fore Congress.294 Consistent with the long-
standing position of the Executive Branch, 
OLC advised the Counsel to the President 
that those senior advisers (the Acting Chief 
of Staff, the Legal Advisor to the National 
Security Council, and the Deputy National 
Security Advisor) were immune from the 
subpoenas issued to them.295 
Across administrations of both political 
parties, OLC ‘‘has repeatedly provided for 
nearly five decades’’ that ‘‘Congress may not 
constitutionally compel the President’s sen-
ior advisers to testify about their official du-
ties.’’ 296 For example, President Obama as-
serted the same immunity for a senior ad-
viser in 2014.297 Similarly, during the Clinton 
administration, 
Attorney 
General 
Janet 
Reno opined that ‘‘immediate advisers’’ to 
the President are immune from being com-
pelled to testify before Congress, and that 
the ‘‘the immunity such advisers enjoy from 
testimonial compulsion by a congressional 
committee is absolute and may not be 
overborne by competing congressional inter-
ests.’’ 298 She explained that ‘‘compelling one 
of the President’s immediate advisers to tes-
tify on a matter of executive decision-mak-
ing would . . . raise serious constitutional 
problems, no matter what the assertion of con-
gressional need.’’ 299 
This immunity exists because senior advis-
ers 
‘‘function 
as 
the 
President’s 
alter 
ego.’’ 300 Allowing Congress to summon the 
President’s senior advisers would be tanta-
mount to permitting Congress to subpoena 
the President, which would be intolerable 
under the Constitution: ‘‘Congress may no 
more summon the President to a congres-
sional committee room than the President 
may command Members of Congress to ap-
pear at the White House.’’ 301 
In addition, immunity is essential to pro-
tect the President’s ability to secure candid 
and confidential advice and have frank dis-
cussions with his advisers. It thus serves, in 
part, to protect the same interests that un-
derlie Executive Privilege.302 As the Supreme 
Court has explained, the protections for con-
fidentiality embodied in the doctrine of Ex-
ecutive Privilege are ‘‘fundamental to the 
operation of Government and inextricably 
rooted in the separation of powers under the 
Constitution.’’ 303 The subpoenas issued to 
the President’s senior advisers in this in-
quiry necessarily implicated three core areas 
of Executive Privilege—presidential commu-
nications, national security and foreign pol-
icy information, and deliberative process. 
First, one of the House Democrats’ obvious 
objectives was to find out about presidential 
communications. The document subpoena 
sent to Acting White House Chief of Staff 
Mulvaney, for instance, sought materials re-
flecting the President’s discussions with ad-
visers,304 and Chairman Schiff’s report spe-
cifically identified documents that House 
Democrats sought, including ‘‘briefing mate-
rials for President Trump,’’ a ‘‘presidential 
decision 
memo,’’ 
and 
presidential 
call 
records.305 
Courts have long recognized constitutional 
limits on Congress’s ability to obtain presi-
dential communications. As the Supreme 
Court has explained, executive decision-
making requires the candid exchange of 
ideas, and ‘‘[h]uman experience teaches that 
those who expect public dissemination of 
their remarks may well temper candor with 
a concern for appearances and for their own 
interests to the detriment of the decision-
making process.’’ 306 Protecting the confiden-
tiality of communications ensures the Presi-
dent’s ability to receive candid advice.307 
Second, there can be no dispute that the 
matters at issue here implicate national se-
curity and foreign policy. As Deputy Na-
tional Security Adviser Kupperman has ex-
plained, House Democrats were ‘‘seeking tes-
timony relating to confidential national se-
curity 
communications 
concerning 
Ukraine.’’ 308 But OLC has established that 
‘‘immunity is particularly justified’’ where a 
senior official’s ‘‘duties concern national se-
curity’’ or ‘‘relations with a foreign govern-
ment’’ 309—subject areas where the Presi-
dent’s authority is at its zenith under the 
Constitution.310 As the Supreme Court ex-
plained in United States v. Nixon, the ‘‘courts 
have traditionally shown the utmost def-
erence to Presidential responsibilities’’ for 
foreign policy and national security, and 
claims of privilege in this area thus receive 
a higher degree of deference than invoca-
tions of ‘‘a President’s generalized interest 
in confidentiality.’’ 311 
The House’s inquiry involved communica-
tions with a foreign leader and the develop-
ment of foreign policy toward a foreign 
country. There are few areas where the 
President’s powers under the Constitution 
are greater and his obligation to protect in-
ternal Executive Branch deliberations more 
profound. 
Third, House Democrats were seeking de-
liberative process information. For instance, 
the committees requested White House docu-
ments reflecting internal deliberations about 
foreign aid, the delegation to President 
Zelensky’s inauguration, and potential meet-
ings with foreign leaders.312 Courts have long 
recognized that the ‘‘deliberative process 
privilege’’ 
applies 
across 
the 
Executive 
Branch and protects ‘‘materials that would 
reveal advisory opinions, recommendations 
and deliberations comprising part of a proc-
ess by which governmental decisions and 
policies are formulated.’’ 313
The privilege 
prevents ‘‘injury to the quality of agency de-
cisions by allowing government officials 
freedom to debate alternative approaches in 
private,’’ 314 and the privilege has been con-
sistently recognized by administrations of 
both political parties.315 
(c) Administration officials properly in-
structed employees not to testify before 
committees 
that 
improperly 
excluded 
agency counsel 
Subpoenas for testimony from other Exec-
utive Branch officials suffered from a dis-
tinct flaw. They impermissibly demanded 
that officials testify without agency counsel 
present.316 OLC has determined that congres-
sional committees ‘‘may not bar agency 
counsel from assisting an executive branch 
witness without contravening the legitimate 
prerogatives of the Executive Branch,’’ and 
that attempting to enforce a subpoena while 
barring agency counsel ‘‘would be unconsti-
tutional.’’ 317 As OLC explained, that prin-
ciple applies in the context of the House’s 
purported impeachment inquiry just as it ap-
plies in more routine congressional oversight 
requests.318 
The requirement for congressional com-
mittees to permit agency counsel to attend 
depositions of Executive Branch officials is 
firmly grounded in the President’s constitu-
tional authorities ‘‘to protect privileged in-
formation from disclosure’’ and to ‘‘control 
the activities of subordinate officials within 
the Executive Branch.’’ 319 As OLC has ex-
plained, without the assistance of agency 
counsel, an Executive Branch employee 
might not be able to determine when a ques-
tion invaded a privileged area.320 It is the 
vital role of agency counsel to ensure that 
constitutionally based confidentiality inter-
ests are protected. Congressional rules do 
not override these constitutional principles, 
and there is no legitimate reason for House 
Democrats to seek to deprive these officials 
of the assistance of appropriate counsel.321 
The important role of agency counsel in 
congressional inquiries has been recognized 
by administrations of both political parties. 
During the Obama Administration, for in-
stance, OLC stated that exclusion of agency 
counsel ‘‘could potentially undermine the 
Executive Branch’s ability to protect its 
confidentiality interests in the course of the 
constitutionally mandated accommodation 
process, as well as the President’s constitu-
tional authority to consider and assert exec-
utive privilege where appropriate.’’ 322 
Requiring agency counsel to be present 
when Executive Branch employees testify 
does not raise any insurmountable problems 
for congressional information gathering. To 
the contrary, as recently as April 2019, the 
House Committee on Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform and the Trump Administration 
were able to work out an accommodation 
that satisfied both an information request 
and the need to have agency counsel present 
for an interview. In that case, after initially 
threatening contempt proceedings over a dis-
pute, the late Chairman Elijah Cummings al-
lowed White House attorneys to attend a 
transcribed interview of the former Director 
of the White House Personnel Security Of-
fice.323 House Democrats could have elimi-
nated a significant legal defect in their sub-
poenas simply by following Chairman Cum-
mings’ example. They did not take this step, 
so the Administration properly accepted the 
advice of OLC that House Democrats’ actions 
were unconstitutional and directed witnesses 
not 
to 
appear 
without 
agency 
counsel 
present. 
2. Asserting legal defenses and immunities 
grounded in the constitution’s separation 
of powers is not an impeachable offense 
House Democrats’ theory that it is ‘‘ob-
struction’’ for the President to assert legal 
rights—especially rights and immunities 
grounded in the separation of powers—turns 
the law on its head and would do permanent 
damage to the structure of our government. 
(a) Asserting Legal Defenses and Privileges 
Is Not ‘‘Obstruction.’’ 
Under fundamental principles of our legal 
system, asserting legal defenses cannot be 
labeled unlawful ‘‘obstruction.’’ In a govern-
ment of laws, asserting legal defenses is a 
fundamental right. As the Supreme Court 
has explained: ‘‘[F]or an agent of the State 
to pursue a course of action whose objective 
is to penalize a person’s reliance on his legal 
rights is ‘patently unconstitutional.’ ’’ 324 As 
Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe cor-
rectly explained in 1998, the same basic prin-
ciples apply in impeachment: 
The allegations that invoking privileges 
and otherwise using the judicial system to 
shield information . . . is an abuse of power 
that should lead to impeachment and re-
moval from office is not only frivolous, but 
also dangerous.325 
Similarly, in 1998, now-Chairman Nadler of 
the House Judiciary Committee agreed that 
a president cannot be impeached for assert-
ing a legal privilege. As he put it, ‘‘the use 
of a legal privilege is not illegal or impeach-
able by itself, a legal privilege, executive 
privilege.’’ 326 
House Democrats, however, ran roughshod 
over 
these 
principles. 
They 
repeatedly 
threatened Executive Branch officials with 
obstruction charges if the officials dared to

assert legal rights against defective sub-
poenas. They claimed that any ‘‘failure or 
refusal to comply with [a] subpoena, includ-
ing at the direction or behest of the Presi-
dent or others at the White House, shall con-
stitute evidence of obstruction.’’ 327
Even 
worse, Chairman Schiff made the remarkable 
claim that any action ‘‘that forces us to liti-
gate or have to consider litigation, will be 
considered further evidence of obstruction of 
justice.’’ 328 Those assertions turn core prin-
ciples of the law inside out. 
(b) House Democrats’ Radical Theory of ‘‘Ob-
struction’’ Would Do Grave Damage to the 
Separation of Powers 
More important, in the context of House 
demands for information from the Executive 
Branch, House Democrats’ radical theory 
that asserting legal privileges should be 
treated immediately as impeachable ‘‘ob-
struction’’ would do lasting damage to the 
separation of powers. 
The Legislative and Executive Branches 
have frequently clashed on questions of con-
stitutional 
interpretation, 
including 
on 
issues surrounding congressional demands 
for information, since the very first presi-
dential administration.329 Such interbranch 
conflicts are not evidence of an impeachable 
offense. To the contrary, they are part of the 
constitutional design. The Founders antici-
pated that the branches might have differing 
interpretations of the Constitution and 
might come into conflict. As Madison ex-
plained, ‘‘the Legislative, Executive, and Ju-
dicial departments . . . must, in the exercise 
of its functions, be guided by the text of the 
Constitution according to its own interpreta-
tion of it.’’ 330 Friction between the branches 
on such points is part of the separation of 
powers at work.331 
When 
the 
Legislative 
and 
Executive 
Branches disagree about their constitutional 
duties with respect to sharing information, 
the proper and historically accepted solution 
is not an article of impeachment. Instead, it 
is for the branches to engage in a constitu-
tionally mandated accommodation process 
in an effort to resolve the disagreement.332 
As courts have explained, this ‘‘[n]egotiation 
between the two branches’’ is ‘‘a dynamic 
process affirmatively furthering the con-
stitutional scheme.’’ 333 
Where the accommodation process fails, 
Congress has other tools at its disposal to 
address a disagreement with the Executive. 
Historically, the House has held Executive 
Branch officials in contempt.334 The process 
of holding a formal vote of the House on a 
contempt resolution ensures that the House 
itself examines the subpoena in question and 
weighs in on launching a full-blown con-
frontation with the Executive Branch.335 In 
addition, in recent times, the House of Rep-
resentatives has taken the view that it may 
sue in court to obtain a judicial determina-
tion of the validity of its subpoenas and an 
injunction to enforce them.336 
In this case, if House Democrats had actu-
ally been interested in securing information 
(rather than merely adding a phony count to 
their impeachment charge sheet), the proper 
course would have been to engage with the 
Administration in one or more of these 
mechanisms for resolving the interbranch 
conflict.337 House Democrats rejected any ef-
fort to pursue any of these avenues. Instead, 
they simply announced that constitutional 
accommodation, contempt, and litigation 
were all too inconvenient for their politi-
cally driven timetable and that they must 
impeach the President immediately.338 
Permitting that approach and treating the 
President’s response to the subpoenas as an 
impeachable offense would do grave damage 
to the separation of powers. Suggesting that 
every congressional demand for information 
must automatically be obeyed on pain of im-
peachment 
would 
undermine 
the 
foundational premise that the Legislative 
and 
Executive 
Branches 
are 
coequal 
branches of the government, neither of 
which is subservient to the other. As Madi-
son explained, where the Executive and the 
Legislative Branches come into conflict 
‘‘neither of them, it is evident, can pretend 
to an exclusive or superior right of settling 
the boundaries between their respective pow-
ers.’’ 339 That is why the courts have insisted 
on an accommodations process by which the 
two branches work to reach a compromise in 
which the interest of each branch is ad-
dressed.340
House Democrats, by contrast, 
have declared the House supreme not only 
over the Executive Branch, but also over the 
Judicial Branch, by baldly proclaiming that, 
whenever a committee chairman invokes the 
possibility of impeachment, the House itself 
is the sole judge of its own powers, because 
(in their view) ‘‘the Constitution gives the 
House the final word.’’ 341 
House Democrats’ theory is unprecedented 
and dangerous for our structure of govern-
ment. There is no reason to believe that the 
House, acting as judge in its own case, will 
properly acknowledge limits on its own pow-
ers. That is evident from numerous cases in 
which courts have refused to enforce con-
gressional subpoenas because they are in-
valid or overbroad.342 More important, the 
House Democrats’ theory means that the 
House could dangle the threat of impeach-
ment over every congressional demand for 
information. Trivializing impeachment in 
this manner would functionally transform 
our government into precisely the type of 
parliamentary system the Framers rejected. 
In his testimony before the House Judici-
ary Committee, Professor Turley rightly 
pointed out that, by ‘‘claiming Congress can 
demand any testimony or documents and 
then impeach any president who dares to go 
to the courts,’’ House Democrats were ad-
vancing a position that was ‘‘entirely unten-
able and abusive [of] an impeachment.’’ 343 
Other scholars agree. In the Clinton im-
peachment, for example, Professor Susan 
Low Bloch testified that ‘‘impeaching a 
president for invoking lawful privileges is a 
dangerous and ominous precedent.’’ 344 
In the past, the House itself has agreed and 
has recognized that a President cannot be 
impeached for asserting a privilege. For ex-
ample, the House Judiciary Committee re-
jected as a ground for impeachment the alle-
gation that President Clinton had ‘‘frivo-
lously and corruptly asserted executive 
privilege’’ in connection with a criminal in-
vestigation.345 Although the Committee be-
lieved that ‘‘the President ha[d] improperly 
exercised executive privilege,’’ 346 it never-
theless determined that this was not an ‘‘im-
peachable offense[].’’ 347 Similarly, over 175 
years ago, the House rejected an attempt to 
impeach President Tyler ‘‘for abusing his 
powers based on his refusals to share with 
the House inside details on whom he was 
considering to nominate to various confirm-
able positions and his vetoing of a wide 
range of Whig-sponsored legislation.’’ 348 
If House Democrats’ unprecedented theory 
of ‘‘obstruction of Congress’’ were correct, 
virtually every President could have been 
impeached. Throughout our history, Presi-
dents have refused to share information with 
Congress. For example, when Congress inves-
tigated Operation Fast and Furious during 
the last administration, President Obama in-
voked Executive Privilege with respect to 
documents responsive to a congressional sub-
poena.349 Instead of a rash rush to impeach-
ment, House Republicans secured a favorable 
court ruling on President Obama’s assertion 
of privilege.350 President Trump’s actions are 
entirely consistent with such steps taken by 
his predecessors. As Professor Turley ex-
plained, ‘‘[i]f this Committee elects to seek 
impeachment on the failure to yield to con-
gressional demands in an oversight or im-
peachment investigation, it will have to dis-
tinguish a long line of cases where prior 
presidents sought . . . [judicial] review while 
withholding witnesses and documents.’’ 351 
House Democrats fare no better in claim-
ing that President Trump announced a more 
‘‘categorical’’ refusal to cooperate with 
House demands than any past president.352 
That claim misunderstands the law and mis-
represents both the President’s conduct and 
history. On the law, there is nothing imper-
missible about asserting rights consistently 
and ‘‘categorically.’’ There is no requirement 
for a President to cede Executive Branch 
confidentiality interests some of the time 
lest he be too ‘‘categorical’’ in their defense. 
On the facts, the President did not issue a 
categorical refusal. As noted above, the 
Counsel to the President made clear to 
House Democrats that, if they sought to pur-
sue regular oversight, the Administration 
would ‘‘stand ready to engage in that process 
as we have in the past, in a manner con-
sistent with well-established bipartisan con-
stitutional protections.’’ 353
It was House 
Democrats who refused to engage in the ac-
commodation process. And as for history, 
past Presidents—such as Presidents Truman, 
Coolidge, and Jackson—did announce cat-
egorical refusals to cooperate at all with 
congressional inquiries.354
None was im-
peached as a result. 
Contrary to House Democrats’ assertions, 
it also makes no difference that the sub-
poenas here were purportedly issued as part 
of an impeachment inquiry.355 The defenses 
and immunities the President has asserted 
are grounded in the separation of powers and 
protect confidentiality interests that are 
vital for the functioning of the Executive 
Branch. Those defenses and immunities do 
not disappear the instant the House opens an 
impeachment inquiry. Just as with the judi-
cial need for evidence in a criminal trial, the 
House’s interest in investigating does not 
mean Executive Privilege goes away; in-
stead, ‘‘it is necessary to resolve those com-
peting interests in a manner that preserves 
the essential functions of each branch.’’ 356 If 
anything, the interbranch conflict inherent 
in an impeachment inquiry heightens the 
need for scrupulous adherence to principles 
preserving each branch’s mechanisms for 
protecting its own legitimate sphere of au-
thority. 
House Democrats’ insistence that the Con-
stitution assigns the House the ‘‘sole Power 
of Impeachment’’ 357 does nothing to advance 
their 
argument. 
That 
provision 
simply 
makes clear that the power of impeachment 
is assigned to the House and not anywhere 
else. It does not make the power of impeach-
ment a paramount authority that sweeps 
away the constitutionally based privileges of 
other 
branches.358
The 
fundamental 
Madisonian principle that each branch must 
place checks on the others—that ‘‘[a]mbition 
must be made to counteract ambition’’—con-
tinues to apply even when the House invokes 
the power of impeachment.359 The mere fact 
that impeachment provides an ultimate 
check on the Executive does not mean the 
Framers made it a blank check for the House 
to expand its power without limit. 
OLC has determined that Executive Privi-
lege principles continue to apply in an im-
peachment inquiry.360
And scholars agree 
that Presidents may assert privileges in re-
sponse to demands for information in an im-
peachment inquiry, as Executive Privilege is 
‘‘essential to the . . . dignified conduct of 
the presidency and to the free flow of candid 
advice to the President.’’ 361 
None of the excuses House Democrats have 
offered justifies their unprecedented leap to

impeachment while bypassing any effort ei-
ther to seek constitutionally mandated ac-
commodations or to go to court. Their claim 
that there was no time is no justification.362 
As Professor Turley has explained, ‘‘[t]he de-
cision to adopt an abbreviated schedule for 
the investigation and not to seek to compel 
such testimony [in court] is a strategic 
choice of the House leadership. It is not the 
grounds for an impeachment.’’ 363 Nor is their 
claim about urgency credible. The only con-
straint on timing here came from House 
Democrats’ self-imposed deadline to ensure 
that this impeachment charade would not 
drag on into the Democratic primary season. 
They also showed no urgency when they 
waited four weeks to send the Articles of Im-
peachment to the Senate. If House Demo-
crats had cared about constitutional prece-
dent, they would have adhered to the ordi-
nary timetable for something as momentous 
as a presidential impeachment and would 
have taken the time to work out disputes 
with the Executive Branch on subpoenas. 
House Democrats arbitrarily decided to skip 
that step. 
Next, Democrats falsely claim that that 
‘‘the House has never before relied on litiga-
tion to compel witness testimony or the pro-
duction of documents in a Presidential im-
peachment proceeding.’’ 364
But the House 
has filed such lawsuits, including just last 
year. In one case, the House made a court fil-
ing asserting that its impeachment inquiry 
entitled it to certain grand jury information 
on the same day the House Judiciary Com-
mittee issued its report.365 And in another 
case purportedly based on an impeachment 
inquiry, House Democrats recently argued 
that, when at an impasse, disputes with the 
Executive Branch can ‘‘only be resolved by 
the courts.’’ 366 These filings are flatly incon-
sistent with House Democrats’ position here, 
where they claim that any impasse should 
lead to impeachment. 
Lastly, House Democrats also find no sup-
port for their theory of ‘‘obstruction’’ in the 
Clinton 
and 
Nixon 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings.367 To the contrary, the Clinton pro-
ceedings establish conclusively that there is 
no plausible basis for an article of impeach-
ment based on the assertion of rights and 
privileges. In 1997 and 1998, there had been 
numerous court rulings rejecting various as-
sertions of Executive Privilege by President 
Clinton.368 The House Judiciary Committee 
concluded that Clinton’s assertions of Execu-
tive Privilege were frivolous, especially be-
cause they related to ‘‘purely private’’ mat-
ters—not official actions.369
Nevertheless, 
the Committee decided that the assertions of 
privilege did not constitute an ‘‘impeachable 
offense[].’’ 370 
Nothing from the Nixon impeachment pro-
ceedings supports House Democrats either. 
The record there included evidence that, as 
part of efforts to cover up the Watergate 
break-in, the President had (among other 
things): provided information from the De-
partment of Justice to subjects of criminal 
investigations to help them evade justice; 
used the FBI, Secret Service, and Executive 
Branch personnel to conduct illegal elec-
tronic surveillance; and illegally attempted 
to secure access to tax return information in 
order to influence individuals.371 Moreover, 
the Committee had transcripts of tapes on 
which the President discussed asserting 
privileges, not to protect governmental deci-
sion making, but solely to stymie the inves-
tigation into the break-in.372 It was only in 
that context that the House Judiciary Com-
mittee narrowly recommended an article of 
impeachment asserting that President Nixon 
had ‘‘failed without lawful cause or excuse to 
produce papers and things’’ sought by Con-
gress.373
There is nothing remotely com-
parable in this case. Among other things, 
every step the Trump Administration has 
taken has been well-founded in law and sup-
ported by the opinion of the Department of 
Justice. Moreover, the subpoenas here at-
tempted to probe into matters involving the 
conduct 
of 
foreign 
relations—matters 
squarely at the core of Executive Privilege 
where the President’s powers and need to 
preserve confidentiality are at their apex. 
(c) The President cannot be removed from 
office based on a difference in legal opinion 
House Democrats’ reckless ‘‘obstruction’’ 
theory is further flawed because it asks the 
Senate to remove a duly elected President 
from office based on differences of legal opin-
ion in which the President acted on the ad-
vice of OLC. As explained above, the Framers 
restricted impeachment to remedy solely 
egregious conduct that endangers the con-
stitutional structure of government. No mat-
ter how House Democrats try to dress up 
their claim, a difference of legal opinion over 
an assertion of grounds to resist subpoenas 
does not rise to that level. The Framers 
themselves recognized that differences of 
opinion could not justify impeachment. As 
Edmund Randolph explained in the Virginia 
ratifying 
convention, 
‘‘[n]o 
man 
ever 
thought of impeaching a man for an opin-
ion.’’ 374 
Until now, that principle has prevailed, as 
the House has expressly rejected attempts to 
impeach presidents based on legal disputes 
over assertions of privilege. As noted above, 
in the Clinton impeachment, the House Judi-
ciary Committee rejected a draft article al-
leging that President Clinton had ‘‘frivo-
lously and corruptly asserted executive 
privilege.’’ 375 Even though the Committee 
concluded that ‘‘the President ha[d] improp-
erly exercised executive privilege,’’ 376 it de-
cided that this was not an ‘‘impeachable 
offense[].’’ 377 The Committee concluded it 
did not have ‘‘the ability to second guess the 
rationale behind the President or what was 
in his mind in asserting that executive privi-
lege’’ and it ‘‘ought to give . . . the benefit 
of the doubt [to the President] in the asser-
tion of executive privilege.’’ 378 As the Com-
mittee recognized, members of Congress need 
not agree that a President’s assertion of a 
privilege or immunity is correct to recognize 
that making the assertion of legal privileges 
itself an impeachable offense is a dangerous 
and unwarranted step. 
The House took a similar view in rejecting 
an attempt to impeach President Tyler in 
1843 when he refused congressional demands 
for information. As Professor Gerhardt has 
explained: 
Tyler’s attempts to protect and assert 
what he regarded as the prerogatives of his 
office were a function of his constitutional and 
policy judgments; they might have been 
wrong-headed or even poorly conceived (at 
least in the view of many Whigs in Con-
gress), but they were not malicious efforts to 
abuse or expand his powers. . . .379 
President Trump’s resistance to congres-
sional subpoenas here was similarly ‘‘a func-
tion of his constitutional and policy judg-
ments.’’ As the House recognized in the cases 
of President Tyler and President Clinton, di-
vergent views on such matters cannot pos-
sibly be sufficient to remove a duly elected 
president from office. And that is especially 
the case here, where President Trump’s ac-
tions were expressly based on advice from 
the Department of Justice. 
II. The Articles Resulted from an Impeachment 
Inquiry that Violated All Precedent and De-
nied the President Constitutionally Re-
quired Due Process. 
Three defects make the House’s purported 
impeachment inquiry irredeemably flawed. 
First, as the Department of Justice advised 
at the time, the House’s investigating com-
mittees compelled testimony and documents 
by issuing subpoenas that were invalid when 
issued and are invalid today. See Parts 
I.B.1(a), II.A. Second, the impeachment in-
quiry failed to provide due process to the 
President as required by the Constitution. 
See Part II.B. Contrary to 150 years of prece-
dent, the House excluded the President from 
the process, denying him any right to par-
ticipate or defend himself. House Democrats 
only pretended to provide the President any 
rights after the entire factual record had 
been compiled in ex parte hearings and after 
Speaker Pelosi had predetermined the result 
by instructing the Judiciary Committee to 
draft articles of impeachment. Third, the 
House’s factual investigation was supervised 
by an interested fact witness, Chairman 
Schiff, who—after falsely denying it—admit-
ted that his staff had been in contact with 
the whistleblower and had given him guid-
ance. See Part II.C. These three fundamental 
errors infected the underpinnings of this 
trial, and the Senate cannot constitutionally 
rely upon House Democrats’ tainted record 
to reach any verdict other than acquittal. 
See Part II.D. Nor is it the Senate’s role to 
give House Democrats a ‘‘do-over’’ to develop 
the record anew in the Senate. These errors 
require rejecting the Articles and acquitting 
the President. 
A. The Purported Impeachment Inquiry Was 
Unauthorized at the Outset and Compelled 
Testimony Based on Nearly Two Dozen In-
valid Subpoenas 
It is emblematic of the rush to judgment 
throughout the House’s slap-dash impeach-
ment inquiry that Chairman Schiff’s inves-
tigating committees began issuing sub-
poenas and compelling testimony when they 
plainly had no authority to do so. The House 
committees built their one-sided record by 
purporting to compel testimony and docu-
ments using nearly two dozen subpoenas 
‘‘[p]ursuant to the House of Representatives’ 
impeachment inquiry.’’ 380 But their only au-
thority was Speaker Pelosi’s announcement 
at a press conference on September 24, 2019. 
As a result, the inquiry and the almost two 
dozen subpoenas issued before October 31, 
2019 came before the House delegated any au-
thority under its ‘‘sole Power of Impeach-
ment’’ to any committee.381 As OLC summa-
rized: 
The Constitution vests the ‘‘sole Power of 
Impeachment’’ in the House of Representa-
tives. U.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 5. For pre-
cisely that reason, the House itself must au-
thorize an impeachment inquiry, as it has 
done in virtually every prior impeachment 
investigation in our Nation’s history, includ-
ing every one involving a President. A con-
gressional committee’s ‘‘right to exact testi-
mony and to call for the production of docu-
ments’’ is limited by the ‘‘controlling char-
ter’’ the committee has received from the 
House. United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 44 
(1953). Yet the House, by its rules, has au-
thorized its committees to issue subpoenas 
only for matters within their legislative juris-
diction. Accordingly, no committee may un-
dertake the momentous move from legisla-
tive oversight to impeachment without a 
delegation by the full House of such author-
ity.382 
Thus, as explained above, all subpoenas 
issued before the adoption of House Resolu-
tion 660 on October 31, 2019, purportedly to 
advance an ‘‘impeachment inquiry,’’ were 
unauthorized and invalid. 
B. House Democrats’ Impeachment Inquiry 
Deprived the President of the Fundamen-

stitution

crats’ impeachment proceedings was the

inquiry and compile the record. The Con-
stitution requires that something as momen-
tous as impeaching the President be done in 
a fundamentally fair way. Both the Due 
Process Clause and separation of powers 
principles require the House to provide the 
President with fair process and an oppor-
tunity to defend himself. Every modern pres-
idential impeachment inquiry—and every 
impeachment investigation for the last 150 
years—has expressly preserved the accused’s 
rights to a fundamentally fair process and 
ensured a balanced development of the evi-
dence. These included the rights to cross-ex-
amine witnesses, to call witnesses, to be rep-
resented by counsel at all hearings, to make 
objections relating to the examination of 
witnesses or the admissibility of evidence, 
and to respond to evidence and testimony re-
ceived. There is no reason to think that the 
Framers designed a mechanism for the pro-
foundly disruptive act of impeaching the 
President 
that 
could 
be 
accomplished 
through any unfair and arbitrary means that 
the House might invent.383 
1. The Text and Structure of the Constitu-
tion Demand that the House Ensure Fun-
damentally Fair Procedures in an Im-
peachment Inquiry 
(a) The Due Process Clause Requires Fair 
Process 
The federal Due Process Clause broadly 
states that ‘‘[n]o person shall . . . be de-
prived of life, liberty, or property, without 
due process of law’’ 384 and applies to every 
part of the federal government. In any pro-
ceeding that may lead to deprivation of a 
protected interest, it requires fair procedures 
commensurate with the interests at stake.385 
There is no exemption from the clause for 
Congress. Thus, for example, the Supreme 
Court has held that due process protections 
apply to congressional investigations and 
provide witnesses in such investigations cer-
tain rights.386 Congress’s ‘‘power to inves-
tigate, broad as it may be, is also subject to 
recognized 
limitations’’—including 
those 
‘‘found in the specific individual guarantees 
of the Bill of Rights.’’ 387 It would be anoma-
lous if the Due Process Clause applied to in-
vestigations conducted under Congress’s leg-
islative power—which aim merely to gather 
information for legislation—but somehow 
did not apply to impeachment investigations 
aimed at stripping individuals of their gov-
ernment positions. An impeachment inves-
tigation against the President potentially 
seeks to charge the President with ‘‘Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors,’’ 388 and to strip the President of 
both (1) his constitutionally granted right to 
‘‘hold his Office during the Term of Four 
years,’’ 389 and (2) his eligibility to ‘‘hold and 
enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit 
under the United States,’’ 390 including to be 
re-elected as President.391 
Those actions plainly involve deprivations 
of property and liberty interests protected 
by the Due Process Clause.392 As a threshold 
matter, it is settled law that even the lowest 
level ‘‘public employees who can be dis-
charged only for cause have a constitu-
tionally protected property interest in their 
tenure and cannot be fired without due proc-
ess.’’ 393 Nothing in the Constitution suggests 
that the impeachment process for addressing 
charges crossing the extraordinarily high 
threshold of ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ 394 should involve 
less fair process than what the Constitution 
requires for every lower-level federal em-
ployee. The Constitution also explicitly 
gives the President (and every individual) a 
protected liberty interest in eligibility for 
election to the Office of President—so long 
as the individual meets the qualifications es-
tablished by the Constitution.395
Finally, 
every federal officer has a protected liberty 
interest in his reputation that would be di-
rectly impaired by impeachment charges.396 
Impeachment by the House alone has an im-
pact warranting the protections of due proc-
ess.397 The House’s efforts to deprive the 
President of these constitutionally protected 
property and liberty interests necessarily 
implicate the Due Process Clause. The fact 
that impeachment is a constitutionally pre-
scribed mechanism for removing federal offi-
cials from office does not make it any the 
less a mechanism affecting rights within the 
ordinary ambit of the clause. 
The gravity of the deprivation at stake in 
an impeachment—especially a presidential 
impeachment—buttresses 
the 
conclusion 
that some due process limitations must 
apply. It would be incompatible with the 
Framers’ understanding of the ‘‘delicacy and 
magnitude of a trust which so deeply con-
cerns the political reputation and existence 
of every man engaged in the administration 
of public affairs’’ 398 to think that they envi-
sioned a system in which the House was free 
to devise any arbitrary or unfair mechanism 
it wished for impeaching individuals. The 
Supreme Court has described due process as 
‘‘the protection of the individual against ar-
bitrary action.’’ 399 There is no reason to 
think that protection was not intended to 
extend to impeachments. 
Similarly, the momentous impact of a 
presidential impeachment on the operation 
of the government suggests that the drafters 
of the Constitution expected the process to 
be governed by procedures that would ensure 
a fair assessment of evidence. The Bill of 
Rights guarantees due process, not out of an 
abstract, academic interest in process as an 
end in itself, but rather due to a belief, deep-
ly rooted in the Anglo-American system of 
law, that procedural protections reduce the 
chances of erroneous decision-making.400 The 
Framers surely did not intend to approve a 
process for determining impeachments that 
would be wholly cut loose from all tradi-
tional mechanisms deemed essential in our 
legal heritage for discovering the truth. 
The sole judicial opinion to reach the ques-
tion held that the Due Process Clause applies 
to impeachment proceedings.401 In Hastings v 
United States, the district court held that the 
Due Process Clause imposes an independent 
constitutional constraint on how the Senate 
exercises its ‘‘sole Power to try all Impeach-
ments.’’ 402 In 1974, the Department of Justice 
suggested the same view, opining that 
‘‘[w]hether or not capable of judicial enforce-
ment, due process standards would seem to 
be relevant to the manner of conducting an 
impeachment proceeding’’ in the House—in-
cluding ‘‘the ability of the President to be 
represented at the inquiry of the House Com-
mittee, to cross-examine witnesses, and to 
offer witnesses and evidence,’’ completely 
separate from the trial in the Senate.403 
(b) The Separation of Powers Requires Fair 
Process 
A proper respect for the head of a co-equal 
branch of the government also requires that 
the House use procedures that are not arbi-
trary and that are designed to permit the 
fair development of evidence. The Framers 
intended the impeachment power to be lim-
ited to ‘‘guard[] against the danger of perse-
cution, from the prevalency of a factious 
spirit.’’ 404 The Constitution places the power 
of impeachment in the entire House pre-
cisely to ensure that a majority of the elect-
ed representatives of the people decide to 
move an impeachment forward. That design 
would be undermined if a House vote were 
shaped by an investigatory process so lop-
sided that it effectively empowered only one 
faction to develop evidence and foreclosed 
the ability of others—including the ac-
cused—to develop the facts. Rather than pro-
moting deliberation by a majority of the 
people’s 
representatives, 
that 
approach 
would foster precisely the factionalism that 
the Framers foresaw as one of the greatest 
dangers in impeachments. ‘‘By forcing the 
House and Senate to act as tribunals rather 
than merely as legislative bodies, the Fram-
ers infused the process with notions of due 
process to prevent impeachment from be-
coming a common tool of party politics.’’ 405 
The need for fair process as a reflection of 
respect for the separation of powers is fur-
ther buttressed by the unique role of the 
President in the constitutional structure. As 
explained above,406
‘‘presidential impeach-
ments are qualitatively different from all 
others’’ because they overturn a national 
election and risk grave disruption of the gov-
ernment.407 It is unthinkable that a process 
carrying such grave risks for the Nation 
should not be regulated by any constitu-
tional limits. And the need for fair process is 
even more critical where, as here, impeach-
ment turns on how the President has exer-
cised authorities within his exclusive con-
stitutional sphere. The President is ‘‘the 
constitutional representative of the United 
States in its dealings with foreign na-
tions.’’ 408 Preserving the President’s ability 
to carry out this constitutional function re-
quires that he be provided fair process and 
an opportunity to defend himself in any in-
vestigation into how he has exercised his au-
thority to conduct foreign affairs. Otherwise, 
a partisan faction could smear the President 
with one-sided allegations with no oppor-
tunity for the President to respond. That 
would threaten to ‘‘undermine the Presi-
dent’s capacity’’ for ‘‘effective diplomacy’’ 
and ‘‘compromise the very capacity of the 
President to speak for the Nation with one 
voice in dealing with other governments.’’ 409 
(c) The House’s Sole Power of Impeachment 
and Power to Determine Rules of Its Own 
Proceedings Do Not Eliminate the Con-
stitutional Requirement of Due Process 
Nothing in the House’s ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment’’ 410 and power to ‘‘determine the 
Rules of its Proceedings’’ 411 undermines the 
House’s obligation to use fundamentally fair 
procedures in impeachment. Those provi-
sions simply mean that the House, and no 
other entity, has these powers. The Supreme 
Court has made clear that independent con-
stitutional constraints limit otherwise ple-
nary powers committed to one of the polit-
ical branches.412 For example, even though 
‘‘[t]he [C]onstitution empowers each house 
to determine its rules of proceedings,’’ each 
House ‘‘may not by its rules ignore constitu-
tional restraints or violate fundamental 
rights.’’ 413 Similarly, the doctrine of Execu-
tive Privilege, which is rooted in the separa-
tion of powers, constrains Congress’s exer-
cise of its constitutionally assigned powers. 
A congressional committee cannot simply 
demand access to information protected by 
Executive Privilege. Instead, if it can get ac-
cess to such information at all, it must show 
that the information ‘‘is demonstrably crit-
ical to the responsible fulfillment of the 
Committee’s functions.’’ 414 The House could 
not evade that constraint by invoking its 
plenary authority to ‘‘determine the Rules of 
its Proceedings’’ 415 and adopting a rule al-
lowing its committees to override Executive 
Privilege.416
Executive Privilege, which is 
itself grounded in the Constitution, similarly 
constrains the House’s ability to demand in-
formation pursuant to its ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment.’’ 417 
Nixon v. United States, in any case, does not 
suggest otherwise.418 Nixon addressed wheth-
er the use of a committee to take evidence in 
a Senate impeachment trial violated the di-
rection in the Constitution that the Senate

shall have ‘‘sole Power to try all Impeach-
ments.’’ 419 The Court held that the challenge 
presented a non-justiciable political ques-
tion 420—specifically, that ‘‘[i]n the case before 
us, there is no separate provision of the Con-
stitution that could be defeated by allowing 
the Senate final authority to determine the 
meaning of the word ‘try’ in the Impeach-
ment Trial Clause.’’ 421 But Nixon did not 
hold that all questions related to impeach-
ment are non-justiciable 422 or that there are 
no constitutional constraints on impeach-
ment. To the contrary, the Court ‘‘agree[d] 
with Nixon that courts possess power to re-
view either legislative or executive action 
that transgresses identifiable textual lim-
its,’’ but merely concluded ‘‘that the word 
‘try’ in the Impeachment Trial Clause does 
not provide an identifiable textual limit on 
the authority which is committed to the 
Senate.’’ 423
More 
importantly, 
the 
justiciability of such questions is irrelevant. 
Constitutional obligations need not be en-
forceable by the judiciary to exist and con-
strain the political branches. As Madison ex-
plained, ‘‘as the Legislative, Executive, and 
Judicial departments of the United States 
are co-ordinate, and each equally bound to 
support the Constitution, it follows that 
each must in the exercise of its functions, be 
guided by the text of the Constitution ac-
cording to its own interpretation of it.’’ 424 
Particularly in the impeachment context, 
‘‘we have to divest ourselves of the common 
misconception 
that 
constitutionality 
is 
discussable or determinable only in the 
courts, and that anything is constitutional 
which a court cannot or will not over-
turn. . . . Congress’s responsibility to pre-
serve the forms and the precepts of the Con-
stitution is greater, rather than less, when 
the judicial forum is unavailable, as it some-
times must be.’’ 425 A holding that a par-
ticular question is a non-justiciable political 
question leaves that question to the political 
branches to use ‘‘nonjudicial methods of 
working out their differences’’ 426 and does 
not relieve the House of its constitutional 
obligation. 
2. The House’s Consistent Practice of Pro-
viding Due Process in Impeachment Inves-
tigations for the Last 150 Years Confirms 
that the Constitution Requires Due Proc-
ess 
Historical practice provides a gloss on the 
requirements of the Constitution and strong-
ly confirms that House impeachment inves-
tigations must adhere to basic forms of due 
process. ‘‘In separation-of-powers cases, th[e] 
[Supreme] Court has often put significant 
weight 
upon 
historical 
practice.’’ 427
As 
James Madison explained, it ‘‘was foreseen 
at the birth of the Constitution, that dif-
ficulties and differences of opinion might oc-
casionally arise in expounding terms [and] 
phrases necessarily used in such a charter 
. . . and that it might require a regular 
course of practice to liquidate [and] settle 
the meaning of some of them.’’ 428 The Con-
stitution ‘‘contemplates that practice will 
integrate the dispersed powers [of the federal 
government] 
into 
a 
workable 
govern-
ment.’’ 429 The Supreme Court has thus ex-
plained that historical practice reflects ‘‘an 
admissible view of the Constitution,’’ 430 and 
‘‘consistent congressional practice requires 
our respect.’’ 431 Although constitutional re-
quirements governing House impeachment 
proceedings may have been unsettled when 
the Constitution was adopted, by the 1870s 
consistent practice in the House (unbroken 
since then) gave meaning to the Constitution 
and settled the minimum procedures that 
must be afforded for a fair impeachment in-
quiry. 
The Framers, who debated impeachment 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
contemporaneous 
English impeachment of Warren Hastings,432 
knew that ‘‘the House of Commons did hear 
the accused, and did permit him to produce 
testimony, before they voted an impeach-
ment against him.’’ 433 And practice in the 
United States rapidly established that the 
accused in an impeachment must be allowed 
fair process. Although a few early impeach-
ment investigations were ex parte,434
the 
House provided the accused with notice and 
an opportunity to be heard in the majority 
of cases starting as early as 1818.435 
By Judge Peck’s impeachment in 1830, 
House Members, explicitly acknowledging 
that ‘‘it was obvious that it had not yet been 
settled by precedent,’’ had an extensive de-
bate to ‘‘settle[]’’ ‘‘[t]he practice in cases of 
impeachments, so far as regards the pro-
ceedings in this House.’’ 436 Judge Peck had 
asked for the House to give him the ability 
to submit a ‘‘written exposition of the whole 
case, embracing both the facts and the law, 
and give him, also, process to call his wit-
nesses from Missouri in support of his state-
ments.’’ 437 The Judiciary Committee Chair-
man, James Buchanan, pointed out that ‘‘in 
the case of Warren Hastings’’ in England, 
‘‘the House of Commons did hear the ac-
cused, and did permit him to produce testi-
mony, before they voted an impeachment 
against him.’’ 438
Mr. Ingersoll explained 
that, in a prior impeachment inquiry against 
Vice President Calhoun, ‘‘a friend of the Vice 
President had been permitted to appear, and 
represent him throughout the whole inves-
tigation,’’ that ‘‘[w]itnesses, also, had been 
examined on the part of the accused,’’ and 
that ‘‘witnesses in favor of the Vice Presi-
dent had been examined, as well as against 
him, and that his representative had been al-
lowed to present before the committee 
through every stage of the examination.’’ 439 
He noted that ‘‘[t]he committee at that time 
took some pains to ascertain what was the 
proper mode of proceeding, and they became 
satisfied that the party accused had, in these 
preliminary proceedings, a right to be thus 
heard.’’ 440
Mr. Pettis similarly concluded 
that ‘‘[t]he request of the Judge is supported 
by the whole train of English decisions in 
cases of a like kind’’ and that he should be 
given those rights here as well.441 The debate 
was thus settled in favor of due process 
rights for Judge Peck.442 
By at least the 1870s, despite some unset-
tled practice in the interim, the House Judi-
ciary Committee concluded that an oppor-
tunity for the ‘‘accused by himself and his 
counsel [to] be heard’’ had ‘‘become the es-
tablished practice of the [Judiciary Com-
mittee] in cases of impeachment’’ and thus 
‘‘deemed it due to the accused that he should 
have’’ due process.443 That ‘‘established prac-
tice’’ has been followed in every House im-
peachment investigation for the past 150 
years 444 and has provided a fixed meaning for 
the constitutional requirements governing 
House impeachment proceedings.445 The fact 
that the House has not followed a perfectly 
consistent practice dating all the way back 
to 1789, or that there were early outliers, is 
irrelevant.446 
The House’s Parliamentarian acknowl-
edges that while ‘‘the committee sometimes 
made its inquiry ex parte’’ in ‘‘earlier prac-
tice’’ before the 1870s, the practice dating to 
the 1870s ‘‘is to permit the accused to testify, 
present witnesses, cross-examine witnesses, 
and be represented by counsel.’’ 447 Current 
House Democrats are already on record 
agreeing that due process protections apply 
in the House’s impeachment inquiries. Chair-
man Nadler has admitted that ‘‘[t]he power 
of impeachment is a solemn responsibility, 
assigned to the House by the Constitution,’’ 
and ‘‘[t]hat responsibility demands a rig-
orous level of due process.’’ 448 He has rightly 
acknowledged, expressly in the context of 
impeachment, that ‘‘[t]he Constitution guar-
antees the right of anyone who is accused of 
any wrongdoing, and fundamental fairness 
guarantees the right of anyone, to have the 
right 
to 
confront 
the 
witness 
against 
him.’’ 449 Rep. Hank Johnson—a current Judi-
ciary Committee member—has similarly rec-
ognized that ‘‘[t]here is a reason for a careful 
process when it comes to the most drastic 
action of impeachment; it is called due proc-
ess.’’ 450 
The two modern presidential impeachment 
inquiries also abundantly confirm the due 
process protections that apply to the accused 
in an impeachment inquiry. In fact, every 
President who has asked to participate in an 
impeachment investigation has been af-
forded extensive rights to do so.451 The House 
Judiciary Committee adopted explicit proce-
dures to provide Presidents Clinton and 
Nixon with robust opportunities to defend 
themselves, including the rights ‘‘to attend 
all hearings, including any held in executive 
session’’; ‘‘respond to evidence received and 
testimony adduced by the Committee’’; 
‘‘submit written requests’’ for ‘‘the Com-
mittee to receive additional testimony or 
other evidence’’; 452 ‘‘question any witness 
called before the Committee’’; and raise 
‘‘[o]bjections relating to the examination of 
witnesses, or to the admissibility of testi-
mony and evidence.’’ 453
President Clinton 
was given access to the grand-jury evidence 
that underpinned the Starr report.454 The 
Committee also ensured that the minority 
could fully participate in the investigation 
and hearings, including by submitting evi-
dence, objecting to witness examination and 
evidence, and exercising co-equal subpoena 
authority to issue a subpoena subject to 
overruling by the full Committee.455 Both 
Presidents were thus able to present robust 
defenses before the Committee.456
Indeed, 
President Clinton’s counsel gave an opening 
statement, the President called 14 expert 
witnesses over two days, and the President’s 
counsel also gave a closing statement 457 and 
cross-examined 
the 
witnesses, 
including 
‘‘question[ing] Judge Starr for an hour.’’ 458 
In this impeachment inquiry, the House In-
telligence Committee fulfilled the investiga-
tory role that the House Judiciary Com-
mittee filled in prior impeachments, and 
thus, these rights should have been available 
in the proceedings before the Intelligence 
Committee. 
3. The President’s Counsel Must Be Allowed 
To Be Present at Hearings, See and 
Present Evidence, and Cross-Examine All 
Witnesses 
The exact contours of the procedural pro-
tections required during an impeachment in-
vestigation must, of course, be adapted to 
the nature of that proceeding. The hallmarks 
of a full blown trial are not required, but 
procedures must reflect, at a minimum, 
basic protections that are essential for en-
suring a fair process that is designed to get 
at the truth. 
The Supreme Court’s ‘‘precedents establish 
the general rule that individuals must re-
ceive notice and an opportunity to be heard 
before the Government deprives them’’ of a 
constitutionally protected interest.459 That 
means, at a minimum, that the evidence 
must be disclosed to the accused, and the ac-
cused must be permitted an opportunity to 
test and respond to the evidence—particu-
larly through ‘‘[t]he rights to confront and 
cross-examine witnesses,’’ which ‘‘have long 
been recognized as essential to due proc-
ess.’’ 460 For 250 years, ‘‘the policy of the 
Anglo-American system of evidence has been 
to regard the necessity of testing by cross- 
examination as a vital feature of the law.’’ 461 
Cross-examination is ‘‘the greatest legal en-
gine ever invented for the discovery of

truth,’’ 462 ‘‘shed[ding] light on the witness’ 
perception, memory and narration’’ 463 and 
‘‘expos[ing] inconsistencies, incompleteness, 
and inaccuracies in his testimony.’’ 464 Thus, 
‘‘[i]n almost every setting where important 
decisions turn on questions of fact, due proc-
ess requires an opportunity to confront and 
cross-examine adverse witnesses.’’ 465
It is 
unthinkable that the Framers, steeped in the 
history of Anglo-American jurisprudence, 
would create a system that would allow the 
Chief Executive and Commander-in-Chief of 
the armed forces to be impeached based on a 
process that developed evidence without pro-
viding any of the elementary procedures that 
the common law developed over centuries for 
ensuring the proper testing of evidence in an 
adversarial process. 
The most persuasive source indicating 
what the Constitution requires in an im-
peachment investigation is the record of the 
House’s own past practice, as explained 
above.466 The due process rights consistently 
afforded by the House to the accused for the 
past 150 years have generally included the 
right to appear and to be represented by 
counsel at all hearings, to have access to and 
respond to the evidence, to submit evidence 
and testimony, to question witnesses and ob-
ject to evidence, and to make opening state-
ments and closing arguments.467 Chairman 
Nadler, Chairman Schiff, other House Demo-
crats, 
and 
then-Representative 
Schumer 
have repeatedly confirmed these procedural 
requirements.468 
4. The House Impeachment Inquiry Failed to 
Provide the Due Process Demanded by the 
Constitution and Generated a Fundamen-
tally Skewed Record That Cannot Be Re-
lied Upon in the Senate 
Despite clear precedent mandating due 
process for the accused in any impeachment 
inquiry—and especially in a presidential im-
peachment inquiry—House Democrats con-
cocted a wholly unprecedented three-stage 
process in this case that denied the Presi-
dent fair process at every step of the way. In-
deed, because the process started without 
any actual authorization from the House, 
committees initially made up the process as 
they went along. In the end, all three phases 
of the House’s inquiry failed to afford the 
President even the most rudimentary proce-
dures demanded by the Constitution, funda-
mental fairness, and over 150 years of prece-
dent. 
(a) Phase I: Secret Hearings in the Basement 
Bunker 
The first phase involved secret proceedings 
in a basement bunker where the President 
was not given any rights at all. This phase 
consisted of depositions taken by joint hear-
ings of the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the House 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the 
House Committee on Oversight and Reform. 
To ensure there would be no transparency 
for the President or the American people, 
depositions were conducted in a facility de-
signed for securing highly classified informa-
tion—even though all of the depositions were 
‘‘conducted 
entirely 
at 
the 
unclassified 
level.’’ 469 The President was denied any op-
portunity to participate. He was denied the 
right to have counsel present. He was denied 
the right to cross-examine witnesses, call 
witnesses, and present evidence. He was even 
denied the right to have Executive Branch 
counsel present during depositions of Execu-
tive Branch officials, thereby undermining 
any ability for the President to protect long-
standing constitutional privileges over Exec-
utive Branch information.470 Members in the 
Republican minority on the investigating 
committees could not provide a counter-
weight to remedy the lack of process for the 
President. They were denied subpoena au-
thority to call witnesses, and they were 
blocked even from asking questions that 
would ensure a balanced development of the 
facts. For example, Chairman Schiff repeat-
edly shut down any line of questioning that 
would have exposed personal self-interest, 
prejudice, or bias of the whistleblower.471 
Finally, House Democrats made clear that 
the proceedings’ secrecy was just a partisan 
stratagem. Daily leaks describing purported 
testimony of witnesses were calculated to 
present the public with a distorted view of 
what was taking place behind closed doors 
and further the narrative that the President 
had done something wrong.472 
House Democrats’ assertions that the base-
ment Star Chamber hearings were justified 
because the House ‘‘serves in a role analo-
gous to a grand jury and prosecutor’’ 473 are 
baseless. The House’s unbroken practice of 
providing due process over the last 150 years 
confirms that the House is not merely a 
grand jury.474 Chairman Nadler, other House 
Democrats, and then-Representative Schu-
mer rejected such analogies as a ‘‘cramped 
view of the appropriate role of the House 
[that] finds no support in the Constitution 
and is completely contrary to the great 
weight of historical precedent.’’ 475 The Judi-
ciary Committee’s own impeachment con-
sultant and staff have rejected ‘‘[g]rand jury 
analogies’’ as ‘‘badly misplaced when it 
comes to impeachment.’’ 476 
More importantly, the narrow rationales 
that justify limiting procedural protections 
in grand juries simply do not apply here.477 
For example, it is primarily grand jury se-
crecy—not the preliminary nature of grand 
jury proceedings in developing the basis for a 
charge—that ‘‘justif[ies] the limited proce-
dural safeguards available to . . . persons 
under investigation.’’ 478
That secrecy, in 
turn, promotes two primary objectives. It al-
lows an investigation to proceed without no-
tice to those under suspicion and thus may 
further the investigation.479 In addition, a 
‘‘cornerstone’’ of grand jury secrecy is the 
policy of protecting the public reputations of 
those who may be investigated but never 
charged.480 
Neither rationale applied to Chairman 
Schiff’s proceedings for a straightforward 
reason: in relevant respects, the proceedings 
were entirely public. Chairman Schiff made 
no secret that the target of his investigation 
was President Trump. He and his colleagues 
held news conferences to announce that fact, 
and they leaked information intended to 
damage the President from their otherwise 
secret hearings.481 In addition, the exact wit-
ness list with the dates, times, and places of 
witness testimony were announced to the 
world long in advance of each hearing. And 
witnesses’ opening statements, as well as 
slanted summaries of their testimony, were 
selectively leaked to the press in real time. 
The entire direction of the investigation, as 
well 
as 
specific 
testimony, 
was 
thus 
telegraphed to the world. These acts would 
have violated federal criminal law if grand 
jury rules had applied.482 
It is also well settled that the one-sided 
procedures employed by Chairman Schiff 
were not designed to be the best mechanism 
for getting at the truth. Grand jury proce-
dures have never been justified on the theory 
that they are well adapted for uncovering ul-
timate facts. To the contrary, as explained 
above, the Anglo-American legal system has 
long recognized that ‘‘adversarial testing,’’ 
particularly cross-examination, ‘‘will ulti-
mately advance the public interest in truth 
and fairness.’’ 483 Those essential procedural 
rights are no less necessary in impeachment 
proceedings unless one adopts the counter-
intuitive assumption that the Framers did 
not intend an impeachment inquiry to use 
any of the familiar mechanisms developed 
over centuries in the common law to get at 
the truth. 
(b) Phase II: The Public, Ex Parte Show Trial 
Before HPSCI 
After four weeks of secret—and wholly un-
authorized—hearings, House Democrats fi-
nally introduced a resolution to have the 
House authorize an impeachment inquiry 
and to set procedures for it. House Resolu-
tion 660, however, merely compounded the 
fundamentally unfair procedures from the 
secret cellar hearings by subjecting the 
President to a second round of ex parte hear-
ings before Chairman Schiff’s committee. 
The only difference was that this second 
round took place in public.484 Thus, after 
screening witnesses’ testimony behind closed 
doors, Chairman Schiff moved on to a true 
show trial—a stage-managed inquisition in 
front of the cameras, choreographed with 
pre-screened testimony to build a narrative 
aiming at a pre-determined result. The 
President was still denied any opportunity to 
participate, to cross-examine witnesses, to 
present witnesses or evidence, or to protect 
constitutionally privileged Executive Branch 
information 
by 
having 
agency 
counsel 
present. All of this was directly contrary to 
the rules that had governed the Nixon and 
Clinton impeachment inquiries. There, the 
President had been allowed to cross-examine 
any fact witnesses called by the com-
mittee.485 In addition, the President had been 
permitted to call witnesses, and the ranking 
member on the investigating committee had 
been permitted co-equal subpoena author-
ity.486 
(c) Phase III: The Ignominious Rubber Stamp 
from the Judiciary Committee 
The House Committee on the Judiciary 
simply rubber-stamped the ex parte record 
compiled by Chairman Schiff and, per the 
Speaker’s direction, relied on it to draft arti-
cles of impeachment. Under House Resolu-
tion 660, it was only during this third phase 
that the President was even nominally al-
lowed a chance to participate and some rudi-
mentary elements of process.487 With fact- 
finding already over, there was no meaning-
ful way to allow the President to use those 
rights for a balanced factual inquiry. In-
stead, the Judiciary Committee doubled 
down on using the skewed, one-sided record 
developed by Chairman Schiff. Thus, the 
only procedural protections that House Res-
olution 660 provided the President were inad-
equate from the outset because they came 
far too late in the proceedings to be effec-
tive. Procedural protections such as cross- 
examination are essential as the factual 
record is being developed. Providing process 
only after the record has been compiled and 
after charges are being drafted can do little 
to remedy the distortions built into the 
record. Here, most witnesses testified twice 
under oath on the same topics—once in a se-
cret rehearsal to preview their testimony, 
and again in public—without any cross-ex-
amination by the President’s counsel. Lock-
ing witnesses into their stories by having 
them testify twice vastly reduces the benefit 
of cross-examination. Any deviation from 
prior testimony potentially exposes a wit-
ness to a double perjury charge, and, worse, 
the prior ex parte testimony becomes fixed in 
each witness’s mind in place of actual mem-
ory. 
While it would have been next to impos-
sible for a proceeding before the Judiciary 
Committee to remedy the defects in the 
prior two rounds of hearings, Chairman Nad-
ler had no interest in even attempting to do 
that. His only interest was following march-
ing orders to report articles of impeachment 
to the House so they could be voted on before 
Christmas. Thus, he repeatedly provided 
vague and inadequate notice about what pro-
ceedings were planned until he ultimately

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S329 
January 21, 2020 
informed the President that he had no plans 
for any evidentiary hearings at all. 
For example, on November 26, 2019—two 
days before Thanksgiving—Chairman Nadler 
informed the President and the Ranking 
Member 
that 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
would hold a hearing on December 4 vaguely 
limited to ‘‘the historical and constitutional 
basis of impeachment.’’ 488
The Chairman 
provided no further information about the 
hearing, including the identities of the wit-
nesses, but nonetheless required the Presi-
dent to indicate whether he wished to par-
ticipate by Sunday, December 1. Every as-
pect of the planning for this hearing de-
parted from the Clinton and Nixon prece-
dents. The Committee afforded the President 
no scheduling input, no meaningful informa-
tion about the hearing, and so little time to 
prepare that it effectively denied the Admin-
istration a fair opportunity to participate. 
The Committee ultimately announced the 
identities of the witnesses less than two days 
before the hearing.489 For a similar hearing 
with scholars in the Clinton impeachment, 
the 
Committee 
provided 
two-and-a-half 
weeks’ notice to prepare and scheduled the 
hearing on a date suggested by the Presi-
dent’s attorneys.490 President Trump under-
standably declined to participate in that bi-
ased constitutional law seminar because he 
could not ‘‘fairly be expected to participate 
in a hearing while the witnesses are yet to be 
named and while it remains unclear whether 
the Judiciary Committee will afford the 
President a fair process through additional 
hearings.’’ 491 
Meanwhile, in a separate letter on Novem-
ber 29, 2019, Chairman Nadler asked the 
President to specify, by December 6, how he 
would participate in future undefined ‘‘pro-
ceedings’’ and which ‘‘privileges’’ in the Ju-
diciary Committee’s Impeachment Proce-
dures the President’s counsel would seek to 
exercise.492 At the same time, he gave no in-
dication as to what these ‘‘proceedings’’ 
would involve, what subjects they would ad-
dress, whether witnesses would be heard (or 
who they would be), or when any hearings 
would be held.493 To inform the President’s 
decision, 
the 
President’s 
counsel 
asked 
Chairman Nadler for information about the 
‘‘scope and nature of the proceedings’’ he 
planned, including topics of hearings, wheth-
er he intended ‘‘to allow for fact witnesses to 
be called,’’ and whether he would allow ‘‘the 
President’s counsel the right to cross exam-
ine fact witnesses.’’ 494 The President’s coun-
sel even offered to meet with Chairman Nad-
ler to discuss a plan for upcoming hear-
ings.495 All to no avail—Chairman Nadler did 
not even bother to respond. 
And the Judiciary Committee continued to 
hide the ball. Throughout the week of De-
cember 2, the President’s counsel were in 
contact with Committee counsel trying to 
get answers concerning what hearings were 
planned, so that the President could deter-
mine whether and how to participate. But all 
that Committee staff were authorized to con-
vey was: (i) a hearing on an unknown topic 
had been publicly announced for December 9; 
(ii) before that hearing, the Committee 
might be issuing two additional reports (one 
based on the December 4 constitutional law 
seminar and one dredging up unspecified as-
pects of Special Counsel Mueller’s report); 
and (iii) they would not have an answer to 
any other questions about the subjects of the 
December 9 hearing or whether any other 
hearings would be scheduled until after the 
close of business on Thursday, December 5. 
On the morning of December 5, Speaker 
Pelosi instructed the Judiciary Committee 
to begin drafting articles of impeachment be-
fore the Committee had received any presen-
tation on the HPSCI report, heard any fact 
witness, or heard a single word from the 
President in his defense.496 Later that day, 
Committee counsel informed the President’s 
counsel that—other than a report addressing 
the meaning of ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’ based on the December 4 con-
stitutional law seminar and other than a 
hearing on December 9 involving a presen-
tation of the HPSCI majority and minority 
reports solely by staff—there were no imme-
diate plans to issue any other reports or 
have any other hearings. 
Meanwhile, Chairman Nadler was also 
playing hide-the-ball with the minority 
members of his own Committee. The Com-
mittee’s Ranking Member, Doug Collins, 
sent at least seven letters to Chairman Nad-
ler trying to find out about the process the 
Committee would follow and requesting spe-
cific rights to ensure a balanced presentation 
of the law and facts, including requesting 
witnesses.497
Chairman Nadler simply ig-
nored them. He offered only an after-the-fact 
response 498 that denied his request for wit-
nesses in part on the misleading claim that 
‘‘the President is not requesting any wit-
nesses,’’ when it was Chairman Nadler who 
had refused to commit to allowing the Presi-
dent to call witnesses in the first place.499 
As a backdrop to all of this, Chairman 
Nadler had threatened to invoke the unprec-
edented provision of the Committee’s Im-
peachment Inquiry Procedures Pursuant to 
House Resolution 660 that allowed him to 
deny the President any due process rights if 
the President continued to assert long-
standing privileges and immunities to pro-
tect Executive Branch information and to 
challenge the validity of the investigating 
committees’ subpoenas.500 This approach also 
departed from all precedent in the Clinton 
and Nixon proceedings.501 Even though both 
Presidents had asserted numerous privileges, 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
never 
con-
templated that offering the opportunity to 
present a defense and to have a fair hearing 
should be conditioned on forcing the Presi-
dent to abandon the longstanding constitu-
tional rights and privileges of the Executive 
Branch. The Supreme Court has already ad-
dressed such Catch–22 choices and has made 
clear that it is ‘‘intolerable that one con-
stitutional right should have to be surren-
dered in order to assert another.’’ 502 Condi-
tioning access to basic procedural rights on 
an agreement to waive other fundamental 
rights is the same as denying procedural 
rights altogether. 
As a result, by the December 6 deadline, 
the President had been left with no meaning-
ful choice at all. The Committee was already 
under instructions to draft articles of im-
peachment before hearing any evidence; 
Chairman Nadler had kept the President in 
the dark until the last minute about how and 
when the Committee would proceed; and 
Committee counsel had finally confirmed 
that the Committee’s plan was to hear solely 
a staff presentation of the HPSCI report and 
not to hold any other hearings. It was abun-
dantly clear that, if the President asked to 
present or cross examine any witnesses, any 
future hearings would merely be window- 
dressing designed to place a veneer of fair 
process on a stage-managed show trial al-
ready hurtling toward a preordained result. 
The President would not be given any mean-
ingful opportunity to question fact witnesses 
or otherwise respond to the one-sided factual 
record transmitted by HPSCI. The Judiciary 
Committee’s assertion that the President 
‘‘could have had his counsel make a presen-
tation of evidence or request that other wit-
nesses be called’’ 503 is thus entirely disingen-
uous. Under those circumstances, the Presi-
dent determined that he would not condone 
House Democrats’ violations of due process— 
and that he would not lend legitimacy to 
their unprecedented procedures—by partici-
pating in their show trial. 
Chairman Nadler ultimately refused to 
allow the Committee to hear from a single 
fact witness or hear any evidence first-hand. 
He also blatantly violated House Rules by re-
fusing to allow the minority to have a mi-
nority hearing day.504 Instead, the Judiciary 
Committee simply relied on the ex parte evi-
dence gathered by Chairman Schiff’s show 
trial with no procedural protections at all. 
And there could be no clearer admission that 
the evidence simply did not matter than 
Speaker Pelosi’s instruction to begin draft-
ing articles of impeachment before the Com-
mittee had even heard any evidence whatso-
ever.505 
All of this conduct highlights rank hypoc-
risy by Chairman Nadler, who, during the 
Clinton impeachment, decried the fact that 
there had been ‘‘no witness called in front of 
this committee against the President’’ and 
declared it ‘‘a failure of the Chairman of this 
committee that we are going to consider vot-
ing impeachment, having heard no witnesses 
whatsoever against the President.’’ 506 Then, 
Chairman Nadler argued that the Judiciary 
Committee cannot simply receive a report 
compiled by another entity (there, the Inde-
pendent Counsel) and proceed to judgment. 
That, in his words, ‘‘would be to say that the 
role of this committee of the House is a mere 
transmission belt or rubber stamp,’’ 507 and 
would ‘‘conclude the inquiry expeditiously, 
but not fairly, and not without trashing the 
Constitution and every principle of due proc-
ess and fundamental fairness that we have 
held sacred since the Magna Carta.’’ 508 House 
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee 
made the same point just a few years ago in 
2016: ‘‘[i]n all modern cases, the Committee 
has conducted an independent, formal inves-
tigation into the charges underlying a reso-
lution of impeachment—again, even when 
other authorities and other congressional 
committees have already investigated the 
underlying issue.’’ 509 
The House’s constitutionally deficient pro-
ceedings have so distorted the factual record 
compiled in the House that it cannot con-
stitutionally be relied upon for the Senate to 
reach any verdict other than acquittal. 
C. The House’s Inquiry Was Irredeemably De-
fective Because It Was Presided Over by an 
Interested Fact Witness Who Lied About 
Contact with the Whistleblower Before the 
Complaint Was Filed 
The House’s entire factual investigation 
was carefully orchestrated—and restricted— 
by an interested fact witness: Chairman 
Schiff. His repeated falsehoods about the 
President leave him with no credibility 
whatsoever. In March 2017, Chairman Schiff 
lied, announcing that he already had evi-
dence that the Trump campaign colluded 
with Russia.510 That was proved false when 
the Mueller Report was released and the en-
tire Russian hoax Chairman Schiff had been 
peddling was disproved. 
In this proceeding, Chairman Schiff vio-
lated basic fairness by overseeing and pros-
ecuting the proceedings while secretly being 
a witness in the case. Before public release of 
the whistleblower complaint, when asked 
whether he had ‘‘heard from the whistle-
blower,’’ Chairman Schiff falsely denied hav-
ing ‘‘heard from the whistleblower,’’ saying: 
‘‘We have not spoken directly with the whis-
tleblower. We would like to . . . But yes, we 
would love to talk directly with the whistle-
blower.’’ 511 As multiple media outlets con-
cluded, 
that 
statement 
was 
‘‘flat-out 
false’’ 512—a ‘‘[w]hopper’’ of a lie that earned 
‘‘four Pinnochios’’ from The Washington 
Post 513—because it ‘‘wrongly implied the 
committee had not been contacted’’ by the 
whistleblower before the complaint was 
filed.514 Subsequent reporting showed that 
Chairman Schiff’s staff had not only had

contact with the whistleblower, but appar-
ently played some still-unverified role in ad-
vising the whistleblower before the com-
plaint was filed.515
And Chairman Schiff 
began the hearings in this matter by lying 
once again and reading a fabricated version 
of the President’s telephone conversation 
with President Zelensky to the American 
people.516 
Given the role that Chairman Schiff and 
his staff apparently played in advising the 
whistleblower, Chairman Schiff made him-
self a fact witness in these proceedings. The 
American people understand that Chairman 
Schiff cannot covertly assist with the sub-
mission of a complaint, mislead the public 
about his involvement, and then pretend to 
be a neutral ‘‘investigator.’’ No wonder 
Chairman Schiff repeatedly denied requests 
to subpoena the whistleblower and shut down 
any questions that he feared might identify 
the whistleblower. Questioning the whistle-
blower would have exposed before the Amer-
ican people the role Chairman Schiff and his 
staff had in concocting the very complaint 
they purported to be investigating. 
D. The Senate May Not Rely on a Factual 
Record Derived from a Procedurally Defi-
cient House Impeachment Inquiry 
The Senate may not rely on a corrupted 
factual record derived from constitutionally 
deficient proceedings to support a conviction 
of the President of the United States. Nor is 
it the Senate’s role to attempt to remedy the 
House’s errors by providing a ‘‘do-over’’ to 
develop the record anew in the Senate. In the 
courts, comparable fundamental errors un-
derpinning the foundations of a case would 
require throwing the case out. The denial of 
‘‘basic protections’’ of due process ‘‘nec-
essarily render[s]’’ a proceeding ‘‘fundamen-
tally unfair,’’ precluding it from ‘‘reliably 
serv[ing] its function as a vehicle for deter-
mination of guilt or innocence.’’ 517 A ‘‘pro-
ceeding infected with fundamental proce-
dural error, like a void judicial judgment, is 
a legal nullity.’’ 518 That is why, for example, 
criminal indictments may not proceed to 
trial when they result from ‘‘fundamental’’ 
errors that cause ‘‘the structural protections 
of the grand jury [to] have been so com-
promised as to render the proceedings fun-
damentally unfair.’’ 519 The same principles 
should apply in the impeachment trial con-
text. The Senate cannot rely on a record de-
veloped in a hopelessly defective House pro-
ceeding to convict the President. 
E. House Democrats Used an Unprecedented 
and Unfair Process Because Their Goal to 
Impeach at Any Cost Had Nothing To Do 
with Finding the Truth 
House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry 
was never a quest for the truth. Instead it 
was an inquisition in pursuit of an offense to 
justify a pre-ordained outcome—impeaching 
President Trump by any means necessary. 
The procedural protections that the House 
has afforded to the accused in every im-
peachment for the last 150 years were incom-
patible with that agenda. Ensuring a fair 
process that uses time-tested methods for 
getting at the truth—like adversarial cross 
examination of witnesses by counsel for the 
accused—takes time and it also risks under-
mining the accusers’ preferred version of the 
facts. But House Democrats had no time. By 
September 2019, when the President released 
the transcript of his telephone call with 
President Zelensky, the 2020 campaign for 
the presidency was already well underway, 
and they needed a fast and tightly controlled 
process that would yield their political goal: 
impeachment by Christmas. 
In fact, House Democrats have been on a 
crusade to impeach the President since the 
moment he took office three years ago. As 
Speaker Pelosi recently confirmed, her par-
ty’s quest for impeachment had ‘‘been going 
on for 22 months . . . [t]wo and a half years, 
actually.’’ 520 The moment that the President 
was sworn in, two liberal advocacy groups 
launched a campaign to impeach him.521 The 
current proceedings began with a complaint 
prepared with the assistance of a lawyer who 
declared in 2017 that he was already planning 
to use ‘‘impeachment’’ to effect a ‘‘coup.’’ 522 
The first resolution proposing articles of im-
peachment against President Trump was 
filed before he had been in office for six 
months.523 As soon as Democrats gained con-
trol of the House in the 2018 midterm elec-
tions, they made clear that they would stop 
at nothing to impeach the President. Rep. 
Rashida Tlaib, for example, announced in 
January 2019: ‘‘[W]e’re going to go in there 
and 
we’re 
gonna 
impeach 
the 
motherf****r.’’ 524 
Over the past three years, House Demo-
crats have filed at least eight resolutions to 
impeach the President, alleging a vast range 
of preposterous purported offenses. They 
have repeatedly charged the President with 
obstruction of justice in connection with the 
Mueller investigation 525—an allegation that 
the Department of Justice resoundingly re-
jected.526 One resolution sought to impeach 
the President for protecting national secu-
rity by restricting U.S. entry by nationals of 
eight countries 527—an action upheld by the 
Supreme Court.528 Another tried to impeach 
the President for publishing disparaging 
tweets about Democrat House members in 
response to their own attacks on the Presi-
dent.529 Still another gathered a hodge-podge 
of absurd charges, including failing to nomi-
nate persons to fill vacancies and insulting 
the press.530 
In this case, House Democrats ran the fast-
est presidential impeachment fact-finding on 
record. They raced through their entire proc-
ess in less than three months from the begin-
ning of their fact-finding investigation on 
September 24, 2019 to the adoption of articles 
on December 18—meeting their deadline of 
impeachment by Christmas. That rushed 
three-month process stands apart from every 
prior presidential impeachment—the fastest 
of which took place after a fact-finding pe-
riod nearly four times as long. Independent 
Counsel Ken Starr received authorization to 
investigate the charges that led to President 
Clinton’s impeachment in January 1998,531 al-
most a full year before the House impeached 
President Clinton in December 1998.532 Con-
gress began investigating President Nixon’s 
conduct in February 1973,533 more than one 
year before July 1974, when the House Judici-
ary Committee voted to recommend articles 
of impeachment.534 The investigation into 
President Johnson also exceeded 12 months. 
Except for a two-month break between a 
vote rejecting articles of impeachment in 
1867 and the authorization of a second im-
peachment inquiry,535
President Johnson’s 
impeachment 
was 
investigated 
over 
14 
months from January 1867 536 to the adoption 
of articles of impeachment in March 1868.537 
The two inquiries were closely related,538 and 
one article of impeachment was carried over 
from the first impeachment inquiry.539 The 
Democrats’ need for speed only underscores 
that, unlike prior impeachments, these pro-
ceedings were never about conducting a seri-
ous inquiry into the truth. 
Although they tried everything, Demo-
crats pinned their impeachment dreams pri-
marily on the Mueller investigation and 
their dogmatic faith in the myth that Presi-
dent Trump—or at least his campaign—was 
somehow in league with Russia. After $32 
million, 2,800 subpoenas, nearly 500 search 
warrants, 230 orders for communications 
records, and 500 witness interviews, that in-
quisition disproved the myth of collusion be-
tween the President or his campaign and 
Russia. As the Mueller Report informed the 
public, Special Counsel Mueller and his team 
of investigators and FBI agents could not 
find any evidence of collusion between the 
Trump Campaign and the Russian govern-
ment.540 While the Mueller investigation was 
pending, though, Chairman Schiff flatly lied 
to the American people, telling them that he 
was privy to ‘‘ ‘more than circumstantial evi-
dence’ 
that 
the 
President’s 
associates 
colluded with Russia.’’ 541 He played up the 
Mueller investigation, promising that it 
would show wrongdoing ‘‘of a size and scope 
probably beyond Watergate.’’ 542 
The damage caused by Democrats’ Russian 
collusion delusion stretches far beyond any-
thing directly attributable to the Mueller in-
vestigation. The Mueller investigation itself 
was triggered by an FBI investigation, 
known as Crossfire Hurricane, that involved 
gross abuses of FBI investigative tools—in-
cluding FISA orders and undercover agents. 
The FBI abused its extraordinary authorities 
to spy on American citizens and a major- 
party presidential campaign.543 According to 
a report from the Inspector General of the 
Department of Justice, these abuses included 
‘‘multiple instances’’ of factual assertions to 
the FISA court that were knowingly ‘‘inac-
curate, incomplete, or unsupported by appro-
priate documentation’’ 544—in other words, 
lies to the FISA court. One FBI official, who 
openly advocated for ‘‘resistance’’ against 
the President, even fabricated evidence to 
persuade the FISA court to maintain surveil-
lance on an American citizen connected with 
the Trump Campaign.545 Tellingly, the In-
spector General could not rule out the possi-
bility that Crossfire Hurricane was corrupted 
by political bias, because the FBI could not 
provide ‘‘satisfactory explanations’’ for the 
extraordinary litany of errors and abuses 
that plagued the investigation from its in-
ception—all of which indicated bias against 
the President.546 
Despite all of this, House Democrats have 
refused to accept the conclusions of the 
Mueller Report. They held hearings and 
issued subpoenas hoping to uncover collusion 
where Mueller had found none. Failing that, 
they tried to keep the impeachment flame 
alive 
by 
manufacturing 
an 
obstruction 
charge—even though the Department of Jus-
tice had already rejected such a claim.547 
They embarked on new fishing expeditions, 
such as demanding the President’s tax re-
turns, investigating the routine Executive 
Branch practice of granting case-by-case ex-
ceptions to the President’s voluntarily un-
dertaken ethics guidelines, and the costs of 
the July 4 ‘‘Salute to America’’ event—all in 
the hope that rummaging through those 
records might give them some new basis for 
attacking the President. 
Democrats have been fixated on impeach-
ment and Russia for the past three years for 
two reasons. First, they have never accepted 
the results of the 2016 election and have been 
consumed by an insatiable need to justify 
their continued belief that President Trump 
could not ‘‘really’’ have won. Long before 
votes had been cast, Democrats had taken it 
as an article of faith that Hillary Clinton 
would be the next President. House Demo-
crats’ impeachment and Russia obsessions 
thus stem from a pair of false beliefs held as 
dogma: that Donald Trump should not be 
President and that he is President only by 
virtue of foreign interference. 
The second reason for Democrats’ fixations 
is that they desperately need an illegitimate 
boost for their candidate in the 2020 election, 
whoever that may be. Put simply, Democrats 
have no response to the President’s record of 
achievement in restoring growth and pros-
perity to the American economy, rebuilding 
America’s military, and confronting Amer-
ica’s adversaries abroad. They have no poli-
cies and no ideas to compete against that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S331 
January 21, 2020 
Instead, they are held hostage by a radical 
left wing that has foisted on the party a rad-
ical agenda of socialism at home and ap-
peasement abroad that Democrat leaders 
know the American people will never accept. 
For Democrats, President Trump’s record of 
success made impeachment an electoral im-
perative. As Congressman Al Green ex-
plained 
it: 
‘‘if 
we 
don’t 
impeach 
the 
[P]resident, he will get re-elected.’’ 548 
The result of House Democrats’ relentless 
pursuit of their obsessions—and their will-
ingness to sacrifice every precedent, every 
principle, and every procedural right stand-
ing in their way—is exactly what the Fram-
ers warned against: a wholly partisan im-
peachment. The Articles of Impeachment 
now before the Senate were adopted without 
a single Republican vote. Indeed, the only bi-
partisan aspect of these articles was congres-
sional opposition to their adoption.549 
Democrats used to recognize that the mo-
mentous act of overturning a national elec-
tion by impeaching a President should never 
take place on a partisan basis, and that im-
peachment should not be used as a partisan 
tool in electoral politics. As Chairman Nad-
ler explained in 1998: 
The effect of impeachment is to overturn 
the popular will of the voters. We must not 
overturn an election and remove a President 
from office except to defend our system of 
government or our constitutional liberties 
against a dire threat, and we must not do so 
without an overwhelming consensus of the 
American people. There must never be a nar-
rowly voted impeachment or an impeach-
ment supported by one of our major political 
parties and opposed by another. Such an im-
peachment will produce divisiveness and bit-
terness in our politics for years to come, and 
will call into question the very legitimacy of 
our political institutions.550 
Senator Leahy agreed: ‘‘A partisan im-
peachment cannot command the respect of 
the American people. It is no more valid than 
a stolen election.’’ 551 Chairman Schiff like-
wise recognized that a partisan impeachment 
would be ‘‘doomed for failure,’’ adding that 
there was ‘‘little to be gained by putting the 
country through that kind of wrenching ex-
perience.’’ 552 Earlier last year even Speaker 
Pelosi acknowledged that, ‘‘before I think we 
should go down any impeachment path,’’ it 
‘‘would have to be so clearly bipartisan in 
terms of acceptance of it.’’ 553 
Now, however, House Democrats have com-
pletely 
abandoned 
those 
principles 
and 
placed before the Senate Articles of Im-
peachment that are partisan to their core. In 
their rush to impeach the President before 
Christmas, Democrats allowed speed and po-
litical expediency to conquer fairness and 
truth. As Professor Turley explained, this 
impeachment ‘‘stand[s] out among modern 
impeachments as the shortest proceeding, 
with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the 
narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a 
president.’’ 554 And as the vote closed, House 
Democrats could not contain their glee. Sev-
eral Democrats clapped; others cheered; and 
still others raised exclamations of joy on the 
floor of the House of Representatives—until 
the Speaker shamed them into silence.555 
The Framers foresaw clearly the possi-
bility of such an improper, partisan use of 
impeachment. As Hamilton recognized, im-
peachment could be a powerful tool in the 
hands 
of 
determined 
‘‘pre-existing 
fac-
tions.’’ 556 The Framers fully recognized that 
‘‘the persecution of an intemperate or de-
signing majority in the House of Representa-
tives’’ was a real danger.557 That is why they 
chose the Senate as the tribunal for trying 
impeachments. Further removed from the 
politics of the day than the House, they be-
lieved the Senate could mitigate the ‘‘danger 
that the decision’’ to remove a President 
would be based on the ‘‘comparative strength 
of parties’’ rather ‘‘than by the real dem-
onstrations of innocence or guilt.’’ 558 The 
Senate would thus ‘‘guard[] against the dan-
ger of persecution, from the prevalency of a 
factious spirit’’ in the House.559 It now falls 
to the Senate to fulfill the role of guardian 
that the Framers envisioned and to reject 
these wholly insubstantial Articles of Im-
peachment that have been propelled forward 
by nothing other than partisan enmity to-
ward the President. 
III. Article I Fails Because the Evidence Dis-
proves House Democrats’ Claims 
Despite House Democrats’ unprecedented, 
rigged process, the record they compiled 
clearly establishes that the President did 
nothing wrong. 
This entire impeachment charade centers 
on a telephone call that President Trump 
had with President Zelensky of Ukraine on 
July 25, 2019. There is no mystery about what 
happened on that call, because the President 
has been completely transparent: he released 
a transcript of the call months ago. And that 
transcript shows conclusively that the call 
was perfectly appropriate. Indeed, the person 
on the other end of the call, President 
Zelensky, has confirmed in multiple public 
statements that the call was perfectly nor-
mal. Before they had even seen the tran-
script, though, House Democrats concocted 
all their charges based on distortions peddled 
by a so-called whistleblower who had no first- 
hand knowledge of the call. And contrary to 
their claims, the transcript proves that the 
President did not seek to use either security 
assistance or a presidential meeting as lever-
age to pressure Ukrainians to announce in-
vestigations on two subjects: (i) possible 
Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election; 
or (ii) an incident in which then-Vice Presi-
dent Biden had forced the dismissal of a 
Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor who 
reportedly had been investigating a company 
(Burisma) that paid Biden’s son, Hunter, to 
sit on its board.560 The President did not 
even mention the security assistance on the 
call, and he invited President Zelensky to 
the White House without any condition 
whatsoever. When the President released the 
transcript of the call on September 25, 2019, 
it cut the legs out from under all of House 
Democrats’ phony claims about a quid pro 
quo. That should have ended this entire mat-
ter. 
Nevertheless, 
House 
Democrats 
forged 
ahead, determined to gin up some other evi-
dence to prop up their false narrative. But 
even their rigged process failed to yield the 
evidence they wanted. Instead, the record af-
firmatively 
refutes 
House 
Democrats’ 
claims. In addition to the transcript, the 
central fact in this case is this: there are 
only two people who have made statements 
on the record who say they spoke directly to 
the President about the heart of this mat-
ter—Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Sen-
ator Ron Johnson. And they both confirmed 
that the President stated unequivocally that 
he sought nothing and no quid pro quo of any 
kind from Ukraine. House Democrats’ claims 
are built entirely on speculation from wit-
nesses who had no direct knowledge about 
anything and who never even spoke to the 
President about this matter. 
House Democrats’ charges also rest on the 
fundamentally mistaken premise that it 
would have been illegitimate for the Presi-
dent to ask President Zelensky about either: 
(i) Ukrainian interference in the 2016 elec-
tion or (ii) the Biden-Burisma affair. That is 
obviously wrong. Asking another country to 
examine potential interference in a past U.S. 
election is always permissible. Similarly, it 
would not have been improper for the Presi-
dent to ask the Ukrainians about an incident 
in which Vice President Biden had threat-
ened withholding U.S. loan guarantees to se-
cure the dismissal of a prosecutor when 
Biden had been operating under, at the very 
least, the appearance of a serious conflict of 
interest. 
A. The Evidence Refutes Any Claim That the 
President Conditioned the Release of Secu-
rity Assistance on an Announcement of In-
vestigations by Ukraine 
The evidence squarely refutes the made-up 
claim that the President leveraged security 
assistance in exchange for Ukraine announc-
ing an investigation into either interference 
in the 2016 election or the Biden-Burisma af-
fair. 
1. The July 25 Call Transcript Shows the 
President Did Nothing Wrong 
The most important piece of evidence dem-
onstrating the President’s innocence is the 
transcript of the President’s July 25 tele-
phone call with President Zelensky. In an 
unprecedented 
act 
of 
transparency, 
the 
President 
made 
that 
transcript 
public 
months ago.561 President Trump did not even 
mention the security assistance on the call, 
and he certainly did not make any connec-
tion between the assistance and any inves-
tigation. Instead, the record shows that he 
raised two issues that are entirely consistent 
with both his authority to conduct foreign 
relations and his longstanding concerns 
about how the United States spends tax-
payers’ money on foreign aid: burden-sharing 
and corruption. 
Burden-sharing 
has 
been 
a 
consistent 
theme of the President’s foreign policy,562 
and he raised burden-sharing directly with 
President Zelensky, noting that ‘‘Germany 
does almost nothing for you’’ and ‘‘[a] lot of 
the 
European 
countries 
are 
the 
same 
way.’’ 563 President Zelensky acknowledged 
that European countries should be Ukraine’s 
biggest partner, but they surprisingly were 
not.564 
President Trump also raised concerns 
about corruption. He first raised these con-
cerns in connection with reports of Ukrain-
ian actions in the 2016 presidential election. 
Numerous media outlets have reported that 
Ukrainian officials took steps to influence 
and interfere in the 2016 election to under-
mine then-candidate Trump, and three Sen-
ate committee chairmen are currently inves-
tigating 
this 
interference.565
President 
Trump raised ‘‘this whole situation’’ and 
noted particularly that President Zelensky 
was ‘‘surrounding [him]self with some of the 
same people.’’ 566
President Zelensky re-
sponded by noting that he had recalled the 
Ukrainian 
Ambassador 
to 
the 
United 
States—an individual who had sought to in-
fluence the U.S. election by authoring an 
anti-Trump op-ed.567 As Democrats’ witness 
Dr. Hill testified, many officials in the State 
Department and NSC were similarly con-
cerned 
about 
individuals 
surrounding 
Zelensky.568 
The President also mentioned an incident 
involving then-Vice President Joe Biden and 
a 
corruption 
investigation 
involving 
Burisma.569 In that incident, a corruption in-
vestigation involving Burisma had report-
edly been stopped after Vice President Biden 
threated to withhold one billion dollars in 
U.S. loan guarantees unless the Ukrainian 
government fired a prosecutor.570
At the 
time, Vice President Biden’s son, Hunter, 
was sitting on the Burisma’s board of direc-
tors.571 The fired prosecutor reportedly had 
been investigating Burisma at the time.572 In 
fact, on July 22, 2019—just days before the 
July 25 call—The Washington Post reported 
that the prosecutor ‘‘said he believes his 
ouster 
was 
because 
of 
his interest in 
[Burisma]’’ and ‘‘[h]ad he remained in his 
post. . .he would have questioned Hunter

Biden.’’ 573
The incident raised important 
issues for anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, 
as it raised at least the possibility that a 
U.S. official may have been involved in de-
railing a legitimate investigation of a for-
eign sovereign. 
As these examples show, President Trump 
raised 
corruption 
issues 
with 
President 
Zelensky. House Democrats’ claim that he 
did not address corruption because the inci-
dents he raised were ‘‘not part of any official 
briefing materials or talking points’’ is non-
sense.574 President Trump spoke extempo-
raneously and used specific examples rather 
than following boilerplate talking points 
proposed by the NSC.575 That is the Presi-
dent’s prerogative. He is not bound to raise 
his concerns with a foreign leader in the 
terms a staffer placed on a briefing card. 
More important, President Zelensky has 
publicly confirmed that he understood Presi-
dent Trump to be talking precisely about 
corruption. On the call, President Zelensky 
acknowledged that the incidents President 
Trump had raised highlighted ‘‘the issue of 
making sure to restore the honesty.’’ 576 As 
President Zelensky later explained, he un-
derstood President Trump to be saying ‘‘we 
are tired of any corruption things.’’ 577 Presi-
dent Zelensky explained that his response 
was essentially, ‘‘[w]e are not corrupt.’’ 578 
In contrast to the explicit discussions 
about burden-sharing and corruption, there 
was no discussion of the paused security as-
sistance on the July 25 call. To fill that gap, 
House 
Democrats 
seize 
on 
President 
Zelensky’s statement that Ukraine was ‘‘al-
most ready to buy more Javelins,’’ and 
President Trump’s subsequent turn of the 
conversation as he said, ‘‘I would like you to 
do us a favor though because our country has 
been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot 
about it.’’ 579 According to House Democrats, 
that sequence alone somehow linked the se-
curity assistance to a ‘‘favor’’ for President 
Trump relating to ‘‘his reelection efforts.’’ 580 
That is nonsense. 
First, President Trump asked President 
Zelensky to ‘‘do us a favor,’’ and he made 
clear that ‘‘us’’ referred to ‘‘our country’’ as 
he put it, ‘‘because our country has been 
through a lot.’’ 581 Second, nothing in the flow 
of the conversation suggests that the Presi-
dent was drawing a connection between the 
Javelin sales and the next topics he turned 
to.582
The 
President 
was 
clearly 
transitioning to a new subject. Third, as 
Democrats’ own witnesses conceded, Javelins 
are not part of the security assistance that 
had been temporarily paused.583 Accordingly, 
House Democrats’ assertion that ‘‘President 
Trump froze’’ Javelin sales ‘‘without expla-
nation’’ is demonstrably false.584 Fourth, the 
President frequently uses variations of the 
phrase ‘‘do us a favor’’ in the context of 
international diplomacy, and the ‘‘favors’’ 
have nothing to do with the President’s per-
sonal interests.585 The President cannot be 
removed from office because House Demo-
crats deliberately misconstrue one of his 
commonly used phrases. 
Notably, multiple government officials 
were on the July 25 call, and only one of 
them—NSC Director for European Affairs 
Alexander Vindman—raised any concerns at 
the time about the substance of it.586 His 
concerns were based primarily on policy dis-
agreements and a misplaced belief that the 
President of the United States should have 
deferred to him on matters of foreign rela-
tions. Lt. Col. Vindman testified that he had 
‘‘deep policy concerns’’ 587 about Ukraine re-
taining bipartisan support,588 but he ulti-
mately conceded that the President not a 
staffer like him sets policy.589 
Mr. Morrison, Lt. Col. Vindman’s super-
visor, affirmed that ‘‘there was nothing im-
proper that occurred during the call.’’ 590 
Similarly, National Security Advisor to the 
Vice President Keith Kellogg said that he 
‘‘heard nothing wrong or improper on the 
call.’’ 591 
2. President Zelensky and Other Senior 
Ukrainian Officials Confirmed There Was 
No Quid Pro Quo and No Pressure on Them 
Concerning Investigations 
The Ukrainian government also made clear 
that President Trump did not connect secu-
rity assistance and investigations on the 
call. The Ukrainians’ official statement did 
not reflect any such link,592 and President 
Zelensky has been crystal clear about this in 
his public statements. He has explained that 
he ‘‘never talked to the President from the 
position of a quid pro quo’’ 593 and stated that 
they did not discuss the security assistance 
on the call at all.594
Indeed, President 
Zelensky has confirmed several separate 
times that his communications with Presi-
dent Trump were ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘normal,’’ and 
‘‘no one pushed me.’’ 595 The day after the 
call, President Zelensky met with Ambas-
sador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and 
Ambassador Taylor in Kyiv. Ambassador 
Volker 
reported 
that 
the 
Ukrainians 
‘‘thought [the call] went well.’’ 596 Likewise, 
Ambassador Taylor reported that President 
Zelensky stated that he was ‘‘happy with the 
call.’’ 597 And Ms. Croft, who met with Presi-
dent Zelensky’s chief of staff Andriy Bohdan 
the day after the call, heard from Bohdan 
that the call ‘‘was a very good call, very 
positive, they had good chemistry.’’ 598 
Other high ranking Ukrainian officials 
confirmed that they never perceived a con-
nection between security assistance and in-
vestigations. Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Vadym Prystaiko stated his belief that 
‘‘there was no pressure,’’ 599 he has ‘‘never 
seen a direct link between investigations and 
security assistance,’’ and ‘‘there was no clear 
connection between these events.’’ 600 Simi-
larly, when President Zelensky’s adviser, 
Andriy Yermak, was asked if ‘‘he had ever 
felt there was a connection between the U.S. 
military aid and the requests for investiga-
tions,’’ he was ‘‘adamant’’ that ‘‘[w]e never 
had that feeling’’ and ‘‘[w]e did not have the 
feeling that this aid was connected to any 
one specific issue.’’ 601 
3. President Zelensky and Other Senior 
Ukrainian Officials Did Not Even Know 
That the Security Assistance Had Been 
Paused 
House Democrats’ theory is further dis-
proved because the evidence shows that 
President Zelensky and other senior Ukrain-
ian officials did not even know that the aid 
had been paused until more than a month 
after the July 25, 2019 call, when the pause 
was reported in Politico at the end of Au-
gust.602 The Ukrainians could not have been 
pressured by a pause on the aid they did not 
even know about. 
The uniform and uncontradicted testimony 
from 
American 
officials 
who 
actually 
interacted with President Zelensky and 
other senior Ukrainian officials was that 
they had no reason to think that Ukraine 
knew of the pause until more than a month 
after the July 25 call. Ambassador Volker 
testified that he ‘‘believe[s] the Ukrainians 
became aware of the delay on August 29 and 
not before.’’ 603 Ambassador Taylor agreed 
that, to the best of his knowledge, ‘‘nobody 
in the Ukrainian Government became aware 
of a hold on military aid until . . . August 
29th.’’ 604 Mr. Morrison concurred, testifying 
that he had ‘‘no reason to believe the 
Ukrainians had any knowledge of the review 
until August 28, 2019.’’ 605 Deputy Assistant 
Secretary Kent and Ambassador Sondland 
agreed.606 
Public statements from high-level Ukrain-
ian officials have confirmed the same point. 
For example, adviser to President Zelensky 
Andriy Yermak told Bloomberg that Presi-
dent Zelensky and his key advisers learned 
of the pause only from the Politico article.607 
And then-Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin 
learned of the pause in the aid ‘‘by reading a 
news article,’’ and Deputy Minister of De-
fense Oleh Shevchuk learned ‘‘through media 
reports.’’ 608 
Further confirmation that the Ukrainians 
did not know about the pause comes from 
the fact that the Ukrainians did not raise 
the security assistance in any of the numer-
ous high-level meetings held over the sum-
mer—something Yermak told Bloomberg they 
would have done had they known.609 Presi-
dent Zelensky did not raise the issue in 
meetings with Ambassador Taylor on either 
July 26 or August 27.610 And Volker—who was 
in touch with the highest levels of the 
Ukrainian 
government—explained 
that 
Ukrainian officials ‘‘would confide things’’ 
in him and ‘‘would have asked’’ if they had 
any questions about the aid.611
Things 
changed, however, within hours of the publi-
cation of the Politico article, when Yermak, a 
top adviser to President Zelensky, texted 
Ambassador Volker to ask about the re-
port.612 
The House Democrats’ entire theory falls 
apart because President Zelensky and other 
officials at the highest levels of the Ukrain-
ian government did not even know about the 
temporary pause until shortly before the 
President released the security assistance. 
As Ambassador Volker said: ‘‘I don’t believe 
. . . they were aware at the time, so there 
was no leverage implied.’’ 613 These facts alone 
vindicate the President. 
4. House Democrats Rely Solely on 
Speculation Built on Hearsay 
House Democrats’ charge is further dis-
proved by the straightforward fact that not a 
single witness with actual knowledge ever 
testified that the President suggested any 
connection between announcing investiga-
tions and security assistance. Assumptions, 
presumptions, and speculation based on 
hearsay are all that House Democrats can 
rely on to spin their tale of a quid pro quo. 
House Democrats’ claims are refuted first 
and foremost by the fact that there are only 
two people with statements on record who 
spoke directly with the President about the 
matter—and both have confirmed that the 
President expressly told them there was no 
connection whatsoever between the security 
assistance and investigations. Ambassador 
Sondland testified that he asked President 
Trump directly about these issues, and the 
President explicitly told him that he did not 
want anything from Ukraine: 
I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no 
quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right 
thing . . . .614 
Similarly, Senator Ron Johnson has said 
that he asked the President ‘‘whether there 
was 
some 
kind 
of 
arrangement 
where 
Ukraine would take some action and the 
hold would be lifted,’’ and the answer was 
clear and ‘‘[w]ithout hesitation’’: ‘‘(Expletive 
deleted)—No way. I would never do that.’’ 615 
Although he did not speak to the President 
directly, Ambassador Volker also explained 
that President Trump never linked security 
assistance to investigations, and the Ukrain-
ians never indicated that they thought there 
was any connection: 
[Q.] Did the President of the United States 
ever say to you that he was not going to 
allow aid from the United States to go to [ ] 
Ukraine unless there were investigations 
into Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 elec-
tions? 
[A.] No, he did not. 
[Q.] Did the Ukrainians ever tell you that 
they understood that they would not get a

meeting with the President of the United 
States, a phone call with the President of 
the United States, military aid or foreign aid 
from the United States unless they under-
took investigations of Burisma, the Bidens, 
or the 2016 elections? 
[A.] No, they did not.616 
Against all of that unequivocal testimony, 
House Democrats base their case entirely on 
witnesses who offer nothing but speculation. 
Worse, it is speculation that traces back to 
one source: Sondland. Other witnesses re-
peatedly invoked things that Ambassador 
Sondland had said in a chain of hearsay that 
would never be admitted in any court. For 
example, Chairman Schiff’s leading witness, 
Ambassador Taylor, acknowledged that, to 
the extent he thought there was a connec-
tion between the security assistance and in-
vestigations, his information came entirely 
from things that Sondland said—or (worse) 
second-hand accounts of what Morrison told 
Taylor that Sondland had said.617 Similarly, 
Morrison testified that he ‘‘had no reason to 
believe that the release of the security-sec-
tor assistance might be conditioned on a 
public statement reopening the Burisma in-
vestigation until [his] September 1, 2019, con-
versation with Ambassador Sondland.’’ 618 
Sondland, however, testified unequivocally 
that ‘‘the President did not tie aid to inves-
tigations.’’ Instead, he acknowledged that 
any link that he had suggested was based en-
tirely on his own speculation, unconnected to 
any conversation with the President: 
[Q.] What about the aid? [Ambassador 
Volker] says that they weren’t tied, that the 
aid was not tied — 
[A.] And I didn’t say they were conclu-
sively tied either. I said I was presuming it. 
[Q.] Okay. And so the President never told 
you they were tied. 
[A.] That is correct. 
[Q.] So your testimony and [Ambassador 
Volker’s] testimony is consistent, and the 
President did not tie aid to investigations. 
[A.] That is correct.619 
Indeed, Sondland testified that he did ‘‘not 
recall any discussions with the White House 
on withholding U.S. security assistance from 
Ukraine in return for assistance with the 
President’s 2020 reelection campaign.’’ 620 
And he explained that he ‘‘did not know (and 
still do[es] not know) when, why, or by whom 
the aid was suspended,’’ so he just ‘‘presumed 
that the aid suspension had become linked to 
the proposed anti-corruption statement.’’ 621 
In his public testimony alone, Sondland used 
variations of ‘‘presume,’’ ‘‘assume,’’ ‘‘guess,’’ 
or ‘‘speculate’’ over thirty times. When asked 
if he had any ‘‘testimony [] that ties Presi-
dent Trump to a scheme to withhold aid 
from Ukraine in exchange for these inves-
tigations,’’ he stated that he has nothing 
‘‘[o]ther than [his] own presumption,’’ and he 
conceded that ‘‘[n]o one on this planet told 
[him] that Donald Trump was tying aid to 
investigations.’’ 622 House Democrats’ asser-
tion that ‘‘President Trump made it clear to 
Ambassador Sondland—who conveyed this 
message to Ambassador Taylor—that every-
thing was dependent on such an announce-
ment [of investigations],’’ simply misrepre-
sents the testimony.623 
5. The Security Assistance Flowed Without 
Any Statement or Investigation by Ukraine 
The made-up narrative that the security 
assistance was conditioned on Ukraine tak-
ing some action on investigations is further 
disproved by the straightforward fact that 
the aid was released on September 11, 2019, 
without the Ukrainians taking any action on 
investigations. President Zelensky never 
made a statement about investigations, nor 
did anyone else in the Ukrainian govern-
ment. Instead, the evidence confirms that 
the decision to release the aid was based on 
entirely unrelated factors. See infra Part 
III.B. The paused aid, moreover, was entirely 
distinct from U.S. sales of Javelin missiles 
and thus had no effect on the supply of those 
arms to Ukraine.624 
6. President Trump’s Record of Support for 
Ukraine Is Beyond Reproach 
Part of House Democrats’ baseless charge 
is that the temporary pause on security as-
sistance somehow ‘‘compromised the na-
tional security of the United States’’ by 
leaving Ukraine vulnerable to Russian ag-
gression.625
The record affirmatively dis-
proves that claim. In fact, Chairman Schiff’s 
hearings established beyond a doubt that the 
Trump Administration has been a stronger, 
more reliable friend to Ukraine than the 
prior 
administration. 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch testified that ‘‘our policy actu-
ally got stronger’’ under President Trump, 
largely because, unlike the Obama adminis-
tration, ‘‘this administration made the deci-
sion to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine’’ 
to help Ukraine fend off Russian aggres-
sion.626 Yovanovitch explained that ‘‘we all 
felt [that] was very significant.’’ 627 Ambas-
sador Taylor similarly explained that the aid 
package provided by the Trump Administra-
tion was a ‘‘substantial improvement’’ over 
the policy of the prior administration, be-
cause ‘‘this administration provided Javelin 
antitank weapons,’’ which ‘‘are serious weap-
ons’’ that ‘‘will kill Russian tanks.’’ 628 Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary Kent agreed that 
Javelins ‘‘are incredibly effective weapons at 
stopping armored advance, and the Russians 
are scared of them,’’ 629
and Ambassador 
Volker explained that ‘‘President Trump ap-
proved each of the decisions made along the 
way,’’ and as a result, ‘‘America’s policy to-
wards Ukraine strengthened.’’ 630 As Senator 
Johnson has noted, President Trump capital-
ized on a longstanding congressional author-
ization that President Obama did not: ‘‘In 
2015, Congress overwhelmingly authorized 
$300 
million 
of 
security 
assistance 
to 
Ukraine, of which $50 million was to be 
available only for lethal defensive weaponry. 
The Obama administration never supplied 
the authorized lethal defensive weaponry, 
but President Trump did.’’ 631 
Thus, any claim that President Trump put 
the security of Ukraine at risk is flatly in-
correct. The pause on security assistance 
(which was entirely distinct from the Javelin 
sales) was lifted by the end of the fiscal year, 
and the aid flowed to Ukraine without any 
preconditions. Ambassador Volker testified 
that the brief pause on releasing the aid was 
‘‘not significant.’’ 632 And Under Secretary of 
State for Political Affairs David Hale ex-
plained that ‘‘this [was] future assistance. 
. . . not to keep the army going now,’’ dis-
proving the false claim made by House 
Democrats that the pause caused any harm 
to Ukraine over the summer.633 In fact, ac-
cording to Oleh Shevchuk, the Ukrainian 
Deputy Minister of Defense who oversaw 
U.S. aid shipments, ‘‘the hold came and went 
so quickly’’ that he did not notice any 
change.634 
B. The Administration Paused Security As-
sistance Based on Policy Concerns and Re-
leased It After the Concerns Were Satisfied 
What the evidence actually shows is that 
President Trump had legitimate policy con-
cerns about foreign aid. As Under Secretary 
Hale explained, foreign aid to all countries 
was undergoing a systematic review in 2019. 
As he put it, ‘‘the administration did not 
want to take a, sort of, business-as-usual ap-
proach to foreign assistance, a feeling that 
once a country has received a certain assist-
ance package . . . it’s something that con-
tinues forever.’’ 635 Dr. Hill confirmed this re-
view and explained that ‘‘there had been a 
directive for whole-scale review of our for-
eign policy, foreign policy assistance, and 
the ties between our foreign policy objec-
tives and the assistance. This had been going 
on actually for many months.’’ 636 
With regard to Ukraine, witnesses testified 
that President Trump was concerned about 
corruption and whether other countries were 
contributing their share. 
1. Witnesses Testified That President Trump 
Had Concerns About Corruption in Ukraine 
Contrary to the bald assertion in the House 
Democrats’ trial brief that ‘‘[b]efore news of 
former Vice President Biden’s candidacy 
broke, President Trump showed no interest 
in corruption in Ukraine,’’ 637 multiple wit-
nesses testified that the President has long 
had concerns about this issue. Dr. Hill, for 
instance, testified that she ‘‘think[s] the 
President has actually quite publicly said 
that he was very skeptical about corruption 
in Ukraine. And, in fact, he’s not alone, be-
cause everyone has expressed great concerns 
about corruption in Ukraine.’’ 638 Similarly, 
Ambassador Yovanovitch testified that ‘‘we 
all’’ 
had 
concerns 
about 
corruption 
in 
Ukraine and noted that President Trump de-
livered an anti-corruption message to former 
Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko in their 
first meeting in the White House on June 20, 
2017.639 NSC Senior Director Morrison con-
firmed that he ‘‘was aware that the Presi-
dent thought Ukraine had a corruption prob-
lem, as did many others familiar with 
Ukraine.’’ 640 And Ms. Croft also heard the 
President raise the issue of corruption di-
rectly with then-President Poroshenko of 
Ukraine during a bilateral meeting at the 
United Nations General Assembly in Sep-
tember 2017.641
She also understood the 
President’s concern ‘‘[t]hat Ukraine is cor-
rupt’’ because she had been ‘‘tasked[] and 
retasked’’ by then-National Security Advisor 
General McMaster ‘‘to write [a] paper to help 
[McMaster] make the case to the President’’ 
in connection with prior security assist-
ance.642 
Concerns about corruption in Ukraine were 
also entirely justified. As Dr. Hill affirmed, 
‘‘eliminating corruption in Ukraine was one 
of, if [not] the central, goals of U.S. foreign 
policy’’ in Ukraine.643 Virtually every wit-
ness agreed that confronting corruption 
should be at the forefront of U.S. policy with 
respect to Ukraine.644 
2. The President Had Legitimate Concerns 
About Foreign Aid Burden-Sharing, Includ-
ing With Regard to Ukraine 
President Trump also has well-documented 
concerns 
regarding 
American 
taxpayers 
being forced to cover the cost of foreign aid 
while other countries refuse to pitch in. In 
fact, ‘‘another factor in the foreign affairs 
review’’ discussed by Under Secretary Hale 
was ‘‘appropriate burden sharing.’’ 645
The 
President’s 2018 Budget discussed this precise 
issue: 
The Budget proposes to reduce or end di-
rect funding for international programs and 
organizations whose missions do not sub-
stantially advance U.S. foreign policy inter-
ests. The Budget also renews attention on 
the appropriate U.S. share of international 
spending at the United Nations, at the World 
Bank, and for many other global issues 
where the United States currently pays more 
than its fair share.646 
Burden-sharing was reemphasized in the 
President’s 2020 budget when it advocated for 
reforms that would ‘‘prioritize the efficient 
use of taxpayer dollars and increased burden- 
sharing to rebalance U.S. contributions to 
international organizations.’’ 647 
House Democrats wrongly claim that ‘‘[i]t 
was not until September . . . that the hold, 
for the first time, was attributed to the 
President’s concern about other countries 
not contributing more to Ukraine’’ 648 and

January 21, 2020 
that President Trump ‘‘never ordered a re-
view of burden-sharing.’’ 649 These assertions 
are demonstrably false. 
Mr. Morrison testified that he was well 
aware of the President’s ‘‘skeptical view’’ 650 
on foreign aid generally and Ukrainian aid 
specifically. He affirmed that the President 
was ‘‘trying to scrutinize [aid] to make sure 
the U.S. taxpayers were getting their mon-
ey’s worth’’ and explained that the President 
‘‘was concerned that the United States 
seemed to—to bear the exclusive brunt of se-
curity assistance to Ukraine. He wanted to 
see the Europeans step up and contribute 
more security assistance.’’ 651 
There is other evidence as well. In a June 
24 email with the subject line ‘‘POTUS fol-
low up,’’ a Department of Defense official re-
layed several questions from a meeting with 
the President, including ‘‘What do other 
NATO 
members 
spend 
to 
support 
Ukraine?’’ 652 Moreover, as discussed above, 
President Trump personally raised the issue 
of burden-sharing with President Zelensky 
on July 25.653 Senator Johnson similarly re-
lated that the President had shared concerns 
about burden-sharing with him. He re-
counted an August 31 conversation in which 
President Trump described discussions he 
would have with Angela Merkel, Chancellor 
of Germany. According to Senator Johnson, 
President Trump explained: ‘‘Ron, I talk to 
Angela and ask her, ‘Why don’t you fund 
these things,’ and she tells me, ‘Because we 
know you will.’ We’re schmucks, Ron. We’re 
schmucks.’’ 654 And Ambassador Taylor testi-
fied that, when the Vice President met with 
President Zelensky on September 1, the Vice 
President reiterated that ‘‘President Trump 
wanted the Europeans to do more to support 
Ukraine.’’ 655 
President Trump’s burden-sharing con-
cerns were entirely legitimate. The evidence 
shows that the United States pays more than 
its fair share for Ukrainian assistance. As 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Cooper testified, 
‘‘U.S. contributions [to Ukraine] are far 
more significant than any individual coun-
try’’ and ‘‘EU funds tend to be on the eco-
nomic side,’’ rather than for ‘‘defense and se-
curity.’’ 656 Even President Zelensky noted in 
the July 25 call that the Europeans were not 
helping Ukraine as much as they should and 
certainly 
not 
as 
much 
as 
the 
United 
States.657 
3. Pauses on Foreign Aid Are Often 
Necessary and Appropriate. 
Placing a temporary pause on aid is not 
unusual. Indeed, the President has often 
paused, re-evaluated, and even canceled for-
eign aid programs. For example: 
In September 2019, the Administration an-
nounced that it was withholding over $100 
million in aid to Afghanistan over concerns 
about government corruption.658 
In August 2019, President Trump an-
nounced that the Administration and Seoul 
were in talks to ‘‘substantially’’ increase 
South Korea’s share of the expense of U.S. 
military support for South Korea.659 
In June, President Trump cut or paused 
over $550 million in foreign aid to El Sal-
vador, Honduras, and Guatemala because 
those countries were not fairly sharing the 
burdens of preventing mass migration to the 
United States.660 
In or around June, the Administration 
temporarily paused $105 million in military 
aid to Lebanon. The Administration lifted 
the hold in December, with one official ex-
plaining that the Administration ‘‘contin-
ually reviews and thoroughly evaluates the 
effectiveness of all United States foreign as-
sistance to ensure that funds go toward ac-
tivities that further U.S. foreign policy and 
national security interests.’’ 661 
In September 2018, the Administration can-
celled $300 million in military aid to Paki-
stan because it was not meeting its counter- 
terrorism obligations.662 
Indeed, Under Secretary Hale agreed that 
‘‘aid has been withheld from several coun-
tries across the globe for various reasons, 
and, in some cases, for reasons that are still 
unknown just in the past year.’’ 663 Dr. Hill 
similarly explained that ‘‘there was a freeze 
put on all kinds of aid and assistance be-
cause it was in the process at the time of an 
awful lot of reviews of foreign assistance.’’ 664 
She added that, in her experience, ‘‘stops and 
starts [are] sometimes common . . . with for-
eign assistance’’ and that ‘‘OMB [Office of 
Management and Budget] holds up dollars all 
the time,’’ including in the past for dollars 
going to Ukraine.665 Similarly, Ambassador 
Volker affirmed that aid gets ‘‘held up from 
time-to-time for a whole assortment of rea-
sons,’’ and explained that ‘‘[i]t’s something 
that had happened in [his] career in the 
past.’’ 666 
4. The aid was released after the Presi-
dent’s concerns were addressed. 
To address President Trump’s concerns 
about corruption and burden-sharing, a tem-
porary pause was placed on the aid to 
Ukraine. Mr. Morrison testified that ‘‘OMB 
represented that . . . the President was con-
cerned about corruption in Ukraine, and he 
wanted to make sure that Ukraine was doing 
enough to manage that corruption.’’ 667 And 
OMB Deputy Associate Director for National 
Security Mark Sandy testified that he un-
derstood the pause to have been a result of 
the President’s ‘‘concerns about the con-
tribution 
from 
other 
countries 
to 
Ukraine.’’ 668 
Over the course of the summer and early 
September, 
two 
series 
of 
developments 
helped address the President’s concerns: 
First, President Zelensky secured a major-
ity in the Ukrainian parliament and was able 
to begin reforms under his anti-corruption 
agenda. As Mr. Morrison explained, when 
Zelensky was first elected, there was real 
‘‘concern about whether [he] would be a gen-
uine reformer’’ and ‘‘whether he would genu-
inely try to root out corruption.’’ 669 It was 
also unclear whether President Zelensky’s 
party would ‘‘be able to get a workable ma-
jority in the Ukrainian Parliament’’ to im-
plement the corruption reforms he prom-
ised.670 It was only later in the summer that 
President’s Zelensky’s party won a majority 
in the Rada—the Ukrainian parliament. As 
Mr. Morrison testified, on ‘‘the opening day 
of the [new] Rada,’’ the Ukrainians worked 
through ‘‘an all-night session’’ to move for-
ward with concrete reforms.671 Indeed, Mr. 
Morrison and Ambassador Bolton were in 
Kyiv on August 27, and Mr. Morrison ‘‘ob-
served that everybody on the Ukrainian side 
of the table was exhausted, because they had 
been up for days working on . . . reform legis-
lation.’’ 672 President Zelensky ‘‘named a new 
prosecutor general’’—a reform that the NSC 
was ‘‘specifically interested in.’’ 673 He also 
‘‘had his party introduce a spate of legisla-
tive reforms, one of which was particularly 
significant,’’ namely, ‘‘stripping Rada mem-
bers of their parliamentary immunity.’’ 674 
Additionally, 
the 
High 
Anti-Corruption 
Court of Ukraine commenced its work on 
September 5, 2019.675 
As a result of these developments, Mr. 
Morrison affirmed that by Labor Day there 
had been ‘‘definitive developments’’ to ‘‘dem-
onstrate that President Zelensky was com-
mitted to the issues he campaigned on.676 
Second, the President heard from multiple 
parties about Ukraine, including trusted ad-
visers. Senator Johnson has said that he 
spoke to the President on August 31 urging 
release of the security assistance. Senator 
Johnson has stated that the President told 
him then that, as to releasing the aid, 
‘‘[w]e’re reviewing it now, and you’ll prob-
ably like my final decision.’’ 677
On Sep-
tember 
3, 
2019, 
Senators 
Johnson 
and 
Portman, along with other members of the 
Senate’s bipartisan Ukraine Caucus, wrote 
to the President concerning the status of the 
aid,678 and on September 5 the Chairman and 
Ranking Member of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee followed suit with another 
letter.679 
Most significantly, Mr. Morrison testified 
that the Vice President advised the Presi-
dent that the relationship with Zelensky ‘‘is 
one that he could trust.’’ 680 The Vice Presi-
dent had met with President Zelensky in 
Warsaw on September 1 and had heard first-
hand that the new Ukrainian administration 
was taking concrete steps to address corrup-
tion and burden-sharing. On corruption re-
form, President Zelensky ‘‘stated his strong 
commitment’’ and shared ‘‘some of the 
things he had been doing,’’ specifically what 
his party had done in the ‘‘2 or 3 days’’ since 
the new parliament had been seated.681 Mor-
rison 
testified 
that, 
on 
burden-sharing, 
‘‘President Zelensky agreed with Vice Presi-
dent Pence that the Europeans should be 
doing more’’ and ‘‘related to Vice President 
Pence conversations he’d been having with 
European leaders about getting them to do 
more.’’ 682 
Moreover, on September 11, 2019, the Presi-
dent 
heard 
directly 
from 
Senator 
Portman.683 Mr. Morrison testified that Sen-
ator Portman made ‘‘the case . . . to the 
President that it was the appropriate and 
prudent thing to do’’ to lift the pause on the 
aid.684 He testified that the Vice President 
(who had just returned from Europe on Sep-
tember 6) and Senator Portman thus ‘‘con-
vinced the President that the aid should be 
disbursed immediately’’ 685—and the tem-
porary pause was lifted after the meeting.686 
C. The Evidence Refutes House Democrats’ 
Claim that President Trump Conditioned a 
Meeting with President Zelensky on Inves-
tigations 
Lacking any evidence to show a connection 
between releasing the security assistance 
and investigations, House Democrats fall 
back on the alternative theory that Presi-
dent Trump used a bilateral meeting as le-
verage to pressure Ukraine to announce in-
vestigations. But no witness with any direct 
knowledge supported that claim either. It is 
undisputed that a bilateral presidential-level 
meeting was scheduled for September 1 in 
Warsaw and then took place in New York 
City 
on 
September 
25, 
2019,687
without 
Ukraine saying or doing anything related to 
investigations. 
1. A Presidential Meeting Occurred Without 
Precondition 
Contrary to House Democrats’ claims, the 
evidence shows that a bilateral meeting be-
tween 
President 
Trump 
and 
President 
Zelensky was scheduled without any connec-
tion to any statement about investigations. 
Mr. Morrison—whose ‘‘responsibilities’’ in-
cluded ‘‘help[ing] arrange head of state visits 
to the White House or other head of state 
meetings’’ 688—testified that he was trying to 
schedule a meeting without any restrictions 
related to investigations. He testified that 
he understood that arranging ‘‘the White 
House visit’’ was a ‘‘do-out’’ that ‘‘came 
from the President’’ on the July 25 call,689 
and he moved forward with a scheduling pro-
posal.690 He worked with Ambassador Taylor 
and the NSC’s Senior Director responsible 
for visits to ‘‘determine dates that would be 
mutually agreeable to President Trump and 
President Zelensky.’’ 691
But due to com-
peting scheduling requests, ‘‘it became clear 
that the earliest opportunity for the two 
Presidents to meet would be in Warsaw’’ at 
the beginning of September.692
In other 
words, Mr. Morrison made it clear that he

S335 
January 21, 2020 
was trying to schedule the meeting in the or-
dinary course. He did not say that anyone 
told him to delay scheduling the meeting 
until President Zelensky had made some an-
nouncement about investigations. Instead, 
he explained that, after the July 25 call, he 
understood that it was the President’s direc-
tion to schedule a visit, and he proceeded to 
execute that direction. 
Ultimately, the notion that a bilateral 
meeting between President Trump and Presi-
dent Zelensky was conditioned on a state-
ment about investigations is refuted by one 
straightforward fact: a meeting was planned 
for September 1, 2019 in Warsaw without the 
Ukrainians saying a word about investiga-
tions. As Ambassador Volker testified, Ad-
ministration officials were ‘‘working on a bi-
lateral meeting to take place in Warsaw on 
the margins of the commemoration on the 
beginning of World War II.’’ 693 Indeed, by 
mid-August, 
U.S. 
officials 
expected 
the 
meeting to occur,694 and the Ukrainian gov-
ernment was making preparations.695 As it 
turned out, President Trump had to stay in 
the U.S. because Hurricane Dorian rapidly 
intensified to a Category 5 hurricane, so he 
sent the Vice President to Warsaw in his 
place.696 
Even that natural disaster did not put off 
the meeting between the Presidents for long. 
They met at the next earliest possible date— 
September 25, 2019, on the sidelines of the 
United Nations General Assembly. President 
Zelensky confirmed that there were no pre-
conditions for this meeting.697 Nor was there 
anything unusual about the meeting occur-
ring in New York rather than Washington. 
As Ambassador Volker verified, ‘‘these meet-
ings between countries sometimes take a 
long time to get scheduled’’ and ‘‘[i]t some-
times just doesn’t happen.’’ 698 
House Democrats cannot salvage their 
claim by arguing that the high-profile meet-
ing in New York City did not count and that 
only an Oval Office meeting would do. Dr. 
Hill explained that what mattered was a bi-
lateral presidential meeting, not the loca-
tion of the meeting: 
[I]t wasn’t always a White House meeting 
per se, but definitely a Presidential-level, 
you know, meeting with Zelensky and the 
President. I mean, it could’ve taken place in 
Poland, in Warsaw. It could’ve been, you 
know, a proper bilateral in some other con-
text. But in other words, a White House-level 
Presidential meeting.699 
The Ukrainians had such a meeting sched-
uled for September 1 in Warsaw (until Hurri-
cane Dorian disrupted plans), and the meet-
ing took place on September 25 in New 
York—all without anyone making any state-
ment about investigations. 
2. No Witness With Direct Knowledge Testi-
fied that President Trump Conditioned a 
Presidential Meeting on Investigations 
House Democrats’ tale of a supposed quid 
pro quo involving a presidential meeting is 
further undermined by the fact that it rests 
entirely on mere speculation, hearsay, and 
innuendo. Not a single witness provided any 
first-hand evidence that the President ever 
linked a presidential meeting to announcing 
investigations. 
Once again, House Democrats’ critical wit-
ness—Sondland—actually 
destroys 
their 
case. He is the only witness who spoke di-
rectly to President Trump on the subject. 
And Sondland testified that, when he broad-
ly asked the President what he wanted from 
Ukraine, the President answered unequivo-
cally: ‘‘I want nothing. I want no quid pro 
quo. I just want Zelensky to do the right 
thing, to do what he ran on.’’ 700 
Sondland clearly stated that ‘‘the Presi-
dent never discussed’’ a link between inves-
tigations and a White House meeting,701 and 
Sondland’s mere presumptions about such a 
link are not evidence. As he put it, the most 
he could do is ‘‘repeat . . . what [he] heard 
through 
Ambassador 
Volker 
from 
Giuliani,’’ 702 who, he ‘‘presumed,’’ spoke to 
the President on this issue.703 But Ambas-
sador Volker testified unequivocally that 
there was no connection between the meeting 
and investigations: 
Q. Did President Trump ever withhold a 
meeting with President Zelensky or delay a 
meeting with President Zelensky until the 
Ukrainians committed to investigate the al-
legations that you just described concerning 
the 2016 Presidential election? 
A. The answer to the question is no, if you 
want a yes-or-no answer. But the reason the 
answer is no is we did have difficulty sched-
uling a meeting, but there was no linkage 
like that. 
Q. You said that you were not aware of any 
linkage between the delay in the Oval Office 
meeting between President Trump and Presi-
dent Zelensky and the Ukrainian commit-
ment to investigate the two allegations as 
you described them, correct? 
A. Correct.704 
Sondland confirmed the same point. When 
asked if ‘‘the President ever [told him] per-
sonally about any preconditions for any-
thing,’’ Sondland responded, ‘‘No.’’ 705 And 
when asked if the President ever ‘‘told [him] 
about any preconditions for a White House 
meeting,’’ he again responded, ‘‘[p]ersonally, 
no.’’ 706 No credible testimony has been ad-
vanced supporting House Democrats’ claim 
of a quid pro quo. 
D. House Democrats’ Charges Rest on the 
False Premise That There Could Have Been 
No Legitimate Purpose To Ask President 
Zelensky About Ukrainian Involvement in 
the 2016 Election and the Biden-Burisma 
Affair 
The charges in Article I are further flawed 
because they rest on the transparently erro-
neous proposition that it would have been il-
legitimate for the President to mention two 
matters to President Zelensky: (i) possible 
Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election; 
and (ii) an incident in which then-Vice Presi-
dent Biden forced the dismissal of a Ukrain-
ian anti-corruption prosecutor who report-
edly had been investigating Burisma. House 
Democrats’ characterizations of the Presi-
dent’s conversation are false. Moreover, as 
House Democrats frame their charges, to 
prove the element of ‘‘corrupt motive’’ at 
the heart of Article I, they must establish 
(in their own words) that the only reason for 
raising those matters would have been ‘‘to 
obtain an improper personal political ben-
efit.’’ 707 And as they cast their case, any in-
vestigation into those matters would have 
been ‘‘bogus’’ or a ‘‘sham’’ because, accord-
ing to House Democrats, neither investiga-
tion would have been ‘‘premised on any le-
gitimate national security or foreign policy 
interest.’’ 708 That is obviously incorrect. 
It would have been entirely proper for the 
President to ask President Zelensky to find 
out about any role that Ukraine played in 
the 2016 presidential election. Uncovering po-
tential foreign interference in U.S. elections 
is always a legitimate goal. Similarly, it 
also would have been proper to ask about an 
incident in which Vice President Biden actu-
ally leveraged the threat of withholding one 
billion dollars in U.S. loan guarantees to se-
cure the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor 
who was reportedly investigating Burisma— 
at a time when his son, Hunter, was earning 
vast sums for sitting on Burisma’s board.709 
House Democrats’ own witnesses established 
ample justification for asking questions 
about the Biden-Burisma affair, as they ac-
knowledged that Vice President Biden’s con-
duct raises, at the very least, the appearance 
of a conflict of interest.710 
1. It Was Entirely Appropriate for President 
Trump To Ask About Possible Ukrainian 
Interference in the 2016 Election 
House Democrats’ theory that it would 
have been improper for President Trump to 
ask President Zelensky about any role that 
Ukraine played in interfering with the 2016 
election makes no sense. Uncovering any 
form of foreign interference in a U.S. presi-
dential election is squarely a matter of na-
tional interest. In this case, moreover, there 
is abundant information already in the pub-
lic domain suggesting that Ukrainian offi-
cials systematically sought to interfere in 
the 2016 election to support one candidate: 
Hillary Clinton. 
To give just a few examples, a former 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) con-
sultant, Alexandra Chalupa, admitted to a 
reporter that Ukraine’s embassy in the 
United States was ‘‘helpful’’ in her efforts to 
collect dirt on President Trump’s then-cam-
paign manager, Paul Manafort.711 As Politico 
reported, ‘‘Chalupa said the [Ukrainian] em-
bassy also worked directly with reporters re-
searching Trump, Manafort and Russia to 
point them in the right directions.’’ 712 A 
former political officer in that embassy also 
claimed the Ukrainian government coordi-
nated directly with the DNC to assist the 
Clinton campaign in advance of the 2016 pres-
idential election.713 And Nellie Ohr, a former 
researcher for the firm that hired a foreign 
spy to produce the Steele Dossier, testified 
to Congress that Serhiy Leshchenko, then a 
member of Ukraine’s Parliament, also pro-
vided her firm with information as part of 
the firm’s opposition research on behalf of 
the DNC and the Clinton Campaign.714 Even 
high-ranking Ukrainian government officials 
played a role. For example, Arsen Avakov, 
Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs, called 
then-candidate Trump ‘‘an even bigger dan-
ger to the US than terrorism.’’ 715 
At least two news organizations conducted 
their 
own 
investigations 
and 
concluded 
Ukraine’s government sought to interfere in 
the 2016 election. In January 2017, Politico 
concluded that ‘‘Ukrainian government offi-
cials tried to help Hillary Clinton and under-
mine Trump by publicly questioning his fit-
ness for office.’’ 716 And on the other side of 
the Atlantic, a separate investigation by The 
Financial Times confirmed Ukrainian election 
interference. The newspaper found that oppo-
sition to President Trump led ‘‘Kiev’s wider 
political leadership to do something they 
would never have attempted before: inter-
vene, however indirectly, in a US elec-
tion.’’ 717 These efforts were designed to un-
dermine Trump’s candidacy because, as one 
member of the Ukrainian parliament put it, 
the majority of Ukrainian politicians were 
‘‘on Hillary Clinton’s side.’’ 718 
Even one of House Democrats’ own wit-
nesses, Dr. Hill, acknowledged that some 
Ukrainian officials ‘‘bet on Hillary Clinton 
winning the election,’’ and so it was ‘‘quite 
evident’’ that ‘‘they were trying to curry 
favor with the Clinton campaign,’’ including 
by ‘‘trying to collect information . . . on Mr. 
Manafort and on other people as well.’’ 719 
If even a fraction of all this is true, 
Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election is 
squarely a matter of national interest. It is 
well settled that the United States has a 
‘‘compelling interest . . . in limiting the par-
ticipation of foreign citizens in activities of 
American democratic self-government, and 
in thereby preventing foreign influence over 
the U.S. political process.’’ 720 Congress has 
forbidden foreigners’ involvement in Amer-
ican elections.721 And President Trump made 
clear more than a year ago that ‘‘the United 
States will not tolerate any form of foreign 
meddling in our elections’’ during his Ad-
ministration.722 Even Chairman Schiff is on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S336 
January 21, 2020 
record agreeing that the Ukrainian efforts to 
aid the Clinton campaign described above 
would be ‘‘problematic,’’ if true.723 
A request for Ukraine’s assistance in this 
case also would have been particularly ap-
propriate because the Department of Justice 
had already opened a probe on a similar sub-
ject matter to examine the origins of foreign 
interference in the 2016 election that led to 
the 
false 
Russian-collusion 
allegations 
against the Trump Campaign. In May of last 
year, Attorney General Barr publicly an-
nounced that he had appointed U.S. Attorney 
John Durham to lead a review of the origins 
and conduct of the Department of Justice’s 
Russia investigation and targeting of mem-
bers of the Trump campaign, including any 
potential wrongdoing.724 As of October, it 
was publicly revealed that aspects of the 
probe had shifted to a criminal investiga-
tion.725 As the White House explained when 
the President announced measures to ensure 
cooperation across the federal government 
with Mr. Durham’s probe, his investigation 
will ‘‘ensure that all Americans learn the 
truth about the events that occurred, and 
the actions that were taken, during the last 
Presidential election and will restore con-
fidence in our public institutions.’’ 726 
Asking for foreign assistance is also rou-
tine. Such requests for cooperation are com-
mon and take many different forms, both 
formal and informal.727
Requests can be 
made pursuant to a Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty, and the U.S. has such a treaty with 
Ukraine that specifically authorizes requests 
for cooperation.728 There can also be infor-
mal requests for assistance.729 Because the 
President is the Chief Executive and chief 
law enforcement officer of the federal gov-
ernment—as well as the ‘‘sole organ of the 
federal government in the field of inter-
national 
relations’’ 730—requesting 
foreign 
assistance is well within his ordinary role. 
Given the self-evident national interest at 
stake in identifying any Ukrainian role in 
the 2016 election, House Democrats resort to 
distorting the President’s words. They strain 
to recast his request to uncover historical 
truth about the last election as if it were 
something relevant only for the President’s 
personal political interest in the next elec-
tion. Putting words in the President’s 
mouth, House Democrats pretend that, be-
cause the President mentioned a hacked 
DNC server, he must have been pursuing a 
claim that Ukraine ‘‘rather than Russia’’ 
had interfered in the 2016 election 731—and 
that assertion, they claim, was relevant sole-
ly for boosting President Trump’s 2020 presi-
dential campaign. But that convoluted chain 
of reasoning is hopelessly flawed. 
To start, simply asking about any Ukrain-
ian involvement in the 2016 election—includ-
ing with respect to hacking a DNC server— 
does not imply that Russia did not attempt 
to interfere with the 2016 election. It is en-
tirely possible that foreign nationals from 
more than one country sought to interfere in 
our election by different means (or coordi-
nated means), and for different reasons. Un-
covering all the facts about any interference 
benefits the United States by laying bare all 
foreign attempts to meddle in our elections. 
And if the facts uncovered end up having any 
influence on the 2020 election, that would not 
be improper. House Democrats cannot place 
an inquiry into historical facts off limits 
based on fears that the facts might harm 
their interests in the next election. 
In addition, House Democrats have simply 
misrepresented President Trump’s words. 
The President did not ask narrowly about a 
DNC server alone, but rather raised a whole 
collection of issues related to the 2016 elec-
tion. President Trump introduced the topic 
by noting that ‘‘our country has been 
through a lot,’’ 732 which referred to the en-
tire Mueller investigation and false allega-
tions about the Trump Campaign colluding 
with Russia. He then broadly expressed in-
terest in ‘‘find[ing] out what happened with 
this whole situation’’ with Ukraine.733 After 
mentioning a DNC server, the President 
made clear that he was casting a wider net 
as he said that ‘‘[t]here are a lot of things 
that went on’’ and again indicated that he 
was interested in ‘‘the whole situation.’’ 734 
He then noted his concern that President 
Zelensky was ‘‘surrounding [him]self with 
some of the same people.’’ 735
President 
Zelensky clearly understood this to be a ref-
erence to Ukrainian officials who had sought 
to undermine then-candidate Trump during 
the campaign, as he responded by imme-
diately noting that he ‘‘just recalled our am-
bassador from [the] United States.’’ 736 That 
ambassador, of course, had penned a harsh, 
undiplomatic 
op-ed 
criticizing 
then-can-
didate Trump, and it had been widely re-
ported that a DNC operative met with 
Ukrainian embassy officials during the cam-
paign to dig up information detrimental to 
President Trump’s campaign.737 
Notably, Democrats have not always be-
lieved that asking Ukraine for assistance in 
uncovering foreign election interference con-
stituted a threat to the Republic. To the 
contrary, in 2018, three Democratic Sen-
ators—Senators Menendez, Leahy, and Dur-
bin—asked Ukraine to cooperate with the 
Mueller 
investigation 
and 
‘‘strongly 
encourage[d]’’ 
then-Prosecutor 
General 
Yuriy Lutsenko to ‘‘halt any efforts to im-
pede cooperation.’’ 738 Not a single Democrat 
in either house has called for sanctions 
against them. Nothing that President Trump 
said went further than the senators’ request, 
and efforts to claim that it was somehow im-
proper are rank hypocrisy. 
2. It Would Have Been Appropriate for Presi-
dent Trump To Ask President Zelensky 
About the Biden-Burisma Affair 
House Democrats’ theory that there could 
not have been any legitimate basis for a 
President of the United States to raise the 
Biden-Burisma 
affair 
with 
President 
Zelensky is also wrong. The following facts 
have been publicly reported: 
Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company 
with a reputation for corruption. Lt. Col. 
Vindman called it a ‘‘corrupt entity.’’ 739 It 
was founded by a corrupt oligarch, Mykola 
Zlochevsky, who has been under several in-
vestigations for money laundering.740 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kent 
testified that Burisma’s reputation was so 
poor that he dissuaded the United States 
Agency 
for 
International 
Development 
(USAID) from co-sponsoring an event with 
Burisma. He testified that he did not think 
co-sponsorship with a company of Burisma’s 
reputation was ‘‘appropriate for the U.S. 
Government.’’ 741 
In April 2014, Hunter Biden was recruited 
to sit on Burisma’s board.742 At that time, 
his father had just been made the ‘‘public 
face of the [Obama] administration’s han-
dling of Ukraine,’’ 743 and Britain’s Serious 
Fraud Office (SFO) had just recently frozen 
$23 million in accounts linked to Zlochevsky 
as part of a money-laundering investiga-
tion.744 Zlochesvsky fled Ukraine sometime 
in 2014.745 
Hunter Biden had no known qualifications 
for serving on Burisma’s board of directors, 
and just two months before joining the 
board, he had been discharged from the Navy 
Reserve for testing positive for cocaine on a 
drug test.746 He himself admitted in a tele-
vised interview that he would not have got-
ten the board position ‘‘if [his] last name 
wasn’t Biden.’’ 747 
Nevertheless, Hunter Biden was paid more 
than board members at energy giants like 
ConocoPhillips.748 
Multiple witnesses said it appeared that 
Burisma hired Hunter Biden for improper 
reasons.749 
Hunter’s role on the board raised red flags 
in several quarters. Chris Heinz, the step-son 
of then-Secretary of State John Kerry, sev-
ered his business relationship with Hunter, 
citing Hunter’s ‘‘lack of judgment’’ in join-
ing the Burisma board as ‘‘a major cata-
lyst.’’ 750 
Contemporaneous 
press 
reports 
openly 
speculated that Hunter’s role with Burisma 
might undermine U.S. efforts—led by his fa-
ther—to promote an anti-corruption message 
in Ukraine.751 Indeed, The Washington Post 
reported that ‘‘[t]he appointment of the vice 
president’s son to a Ukrainian oil board 
looks 
nepotistic 
at 
best, 
nefarious 
at 
worst.’’ 752 
Within the Obama Administration, Hunt-
er’s position caused the special envoy for en-
ergy policy, Amos Hochstein, to ‘‘raise[] the 
matter with Biden.’’ 753
Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State Kent testified that he, 
too, voiced concerns with Vice President 
Biden’s office.754 
In fact, every witness who was asked 
agreed that Hunter’s role created at least 
the appearance of a conflict of interest for 
his father.755 
On February 2, 2016, the Ukrainian Pros-
ecutor General obtained a court order to 
seize Zlochevsky’s property.756 
According to press reports, Vice President 
Biden then spoke with Ukraine’s President 
Poroshenko three times by telephone on 
February 11, 18, and 19, 2016.757 
Vice President Biden has openly bragged 
that, around that time, he threatened Presi-
dent Poroshenko that he would withhold one 
billion dollars in U.S. loan guarantees unless 
the Ukrainians fired the Prosecutor General 
who was investigating Burisma.758 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent testified 
that the Prosecutor General’s removal ‘‘be-
came a condition of the loan guarantee.’’ 759 
On March 29, 2016, Ukraine’s parliament 
dismissed the Prosecutor General.760 In Sep-
tember 2016, a Kiev court cancelled an arrest 
warrant for Zlochevsky.761 
In January 2017, Burisma announced that 
all 
cases 
against 
the 
company 
and 
Zlochevsky had been closed.762 
On these facts, it would have been wholly 
appropriate for the President to ask Presi-
dent Zelensky about the whole Biden- 
Burisma affair. The Vice President of the 
United States, while operating under an ap-
parent conflict of interest, had possibly used 
a billion dollars in U.S. loan guarantees to 
force the dismissal of a prosecutor who may 
have been pursuing a legitimate corruption 
investigation. In fact, on July 22, 2019—just 
days before the July 25 call—The Washington 
Post reported that the fired prosecutor ‘‘said 
he believes his ouster was because of his in-
terest in [Burisma]’’ and ‘‘[h]ad he remained 
in his post . . . he would have questioned 
Hunter Biden.’’ 763 Even if the Vice Presi-
dent’s motives were pure, the possibility 
that a U.S. official used his position to derail 
a meritorious investigation made the Biden- 
Burisma affair a legitimate subject to raise. 
Indeed, any President would have wanted to 
make clear both that the United States was 
not placing any inquiry into the incident off 
limits and that, in the future, there would be 
no efforts by U.S. officials do something as 
‘‘horrible’’ as strong-arming Ukraine into 
dropping corruption investigations while op-
erating under an obvious conflict of inter-
est.764 
As 
the 
transcript 
shows, 
President 
Zelensky recognized precisely the point. He 
responded to President Trump by noting 
that ‘‘[t]he issue of the investigation of the 
case is actually the issue of making sure to 
restore the honesty[.]’’ 765

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S337 
January 21, 2020 
It is absurd for House Democrats to argue 
that any reference to the Biden-Burisma af-
fair had no purpose other than damaging the 
President’s potential political opponent. The 
two participants on the call—the leaders of 
two sovereign nations—clearly understood 
the discussion to advance the U.S. foreign 
policy interest in ensuring that Ukraine’s 
new 
President 
felt 
free, 
in 
President 
Zelensky’s words, to ‘‘restore the honesty’’ 
to corruption investigations.766 
Moreover, House Democrats’ accusations 
rest on the false and dangerous premise that 
Vice President Biden somehow immunized 
his conduct (and his son’s) from any scrutiny 
by declaring his run for the presidency. 
There is no such rule of law. It certainly was 
not a rule applied when President Trump was 
a candidate. His political opponents called 
for investigations against him and his chil-
dren almost daily.767 Nothing in the law re-
quires the government to turn a blind eye to 
potential wrongdoing based on a person’s 
status as a candidate for President of the 
United States. If anything, the possibility 
that Vice President Biden may ascend to the 
highest office in the country provides a com-
pelling reason for ensuring that, when he 
forced Ukraine to fire its Prosecutor Gen-
eral, his family was not corruptly benefit-
ting from his actions. 
Importantly, mentioning the whole Biden- 
Burisma affair would have been entirely jus-
tified as long as there was a reasonable basis 
to think that looking into the matter would 
advance the public interest. To defend mere-
ly asking a question, the President would not 
bear any burden of showing that Vice Presi-
dent Biden (or his son) actually committed 
any wrongdoing. 
By contrast, under their own theory of the 
case, for the House Managers to carry their 
burden of proving that merely raising the 
matter was ‘‘illegitimate,’’ they would have 
to prove that raising the issue could have no 
legitimate purpose whatsoever. Their theory 
is obviously false. And especially on this 
record, the House Managers cannot possibly 
carry that burden, because no such definitive 
proof exists. Nobody, not even House Demo-
crats’ own witnesses, could testify that the 
Bidens’ conduct did not at least facially 
raise an appearance of a conflict of interest. 
And while House Democrats repeatedly in-
sist that any suggestions that Vice President 
Biden or his son did anything wrong are ‘‘de-
bunked conspiracy theories’’ and ‘‘without 
merit,’’ 768 they lack any evidence to support 
those bald assertions, because they have 
steadfastly cut off any real inquiry into the 
Bidens’ conduct. For example, they have re-
fused to call Hunter Biden to testify.769 In-
stead, they have been adamant that Ameri-
cans must simply accept the diktat that the 
Bidens’ conduct could not possibly have been 
part of a course of conduct in which the Of-
fice of the Vice President was misused to 
protect the financial interests of a family 
member. 
The Senate cannot accept House Demo-
crats’ mere say-so as proof. Especially in the 
context of this wholly partisan impeach-
ment, House Democrats’ assurance of, ‘‘trust 
us, there’s nothing to see here,’’ is not a per-
missible foundation for building a case to re-
move a duly elected President from office— 
especially given Chairman Schiff’s track 
record for making false claims in order to 
damage the President.770 
IV. The Articles Are Structurally Deficient and 
Can Only Result in Acquittal 
The Articles also suffer from a fatal struc-
tural defect. Put simply, the articles are 
impermissibly duplicitous—that is, each ar-
ticle charges multiple different acts as pos-
sible grounds for sustaining a conviction.771 
The problem with an article offering such a 
menu of options is that the Constitution re-
quires two-thirds of Senators present to 
agree on the specific basis for conviction. A 
vote on a duplicitous article, however, could 
never provide certainty that a two-thirds 
majority had actually agreed upon a ground 
for conviction. Instead, such a vote could be 
the product of an amalgamation of votes 
resting on several different theories, no sin-
gle one of which would have garnered two- 
thirds support if it had been presented sepa-
rately. Accordingly, duplicitous articles like 
those exhibited here are facially unconstitu-
tional. 
A. The Constitution Requires Two-Thirds of 
Senators To Agree on the Specific Act that 
Is the Basis for Conviction and Thus Pro-
hibits Duplicitous Articles 
In impeachment trials, the Constitution 
mandates that ‘‘no Person shall be convicted 
without the Concurrence of two thirds of the 
Members present.’’ 772
That provision re-
quires two-thirds agreement on the specific 
act that warrants conviction. That is why 
the Senate has repeatedly made clear in 
prior impeachments that acquittal is re-
quired when duplicitous articles are pre-
sented. 
In the Clinton impeachment,773 for exam-
ple, Senator Carl Levin explained his vote to 
acquit by pointing out that the House had 
‘‘made a significant and irreparable mistake 
in the actual drafting of the articles.’’ 774 Be-
cause each article alleged multiple acts of 
wrongdoing, it would be ‘‘impossible’’ ever to 
determine ‘‘whether a two-thirds majority of 
the Senate actually agreed on a particular 
allegation.’’ 775 Senator Charles Robb echoed 
those concerns, explaining that ‘‘the uncon-
stitutional bundling of charges’’ in these ar-
ticles ‘‘violates this constitutional require-
ment’’ of two-thirds agreement to convict.776 
As he pointed out, because Article II, in par-
ticular, ‘‘contain[ed] 7 subparts each alleging 
a separate act of obstruction of justice, the 
bundling of these allegations would allow re-
moval of the President if only 10 Senators 
agreed on each of the 7 separate sub-
parts.’’ 777 Senator Chris Dodd agreed, ex-
plaining that ‘‘[t]his smorgasbord approach 
to the allegations’’ was a threshold legal 
flaw that even called for dismissal outright 
and pointed to the ‘‘deeply troubling pros-
pect’’ of ‘‘convict[ing] and remov[ing] with-
out two-thirds of the Senate agreeing on pre-
cisely what [the President] did wrong.’’ 778 
The Senate similarly rejected a duplicitous 
article against President Andrew Johnson. 
That article alleged that Johnson had de-
clared in a speech that the Thirty-Ninth 
Congress was not lawful and that he com-
mitted three different acts in pursuit of that 
declaration.779 In opposing the article, Sen-
ator John Henderson emphasized ‘‘the great 
difficulty’’ presented by the omnibus article 
in ascertaining ‘‘what it really charges.’’ 780 
Senator Garrett Davis similarly complained 
that the allegations were apparently ‘‘drawn 
with studied looseness, duplicity, and vague-
ness, as with the purpose to mislead’’ and 
should have ‘‘been separately’’ and ‘‘dis-
tinctly stated.’’ 781 
The Senate has also rejected unconsti-
tutionally duplicitous articles of impeach-
ment against judges. In the impeachment of 
Judge Nixon, for example, Senator Frank 
Murkowski rejected the ‘‘the omnibus nature 
of article III,’’ which charged the judge with 
making multiple different false statements, 
and he ‘‘agree[d] with the argument that the 
article could easily be used to convict Judge 
Nixon by less than the super majority vote 
required by the Constitution.’’ 782
Senator 
Herbert Kohl explained why this defect was 
fatal: ‘‘The House is telling us that it’s OK to 
convict Judge Nixon on [the article] even if 
we have different visions of what he did 
wrong. But that’s not fair to Judge Nixon, to 
the Senate, or to the American people.’’ 783 
B. The Articles Are Unconstitutionally 
Duplicitous 
Here, 
each 
Article 
is 
impermissibly 
duplicitous. Each Article presents a smor-
gasbord of multiple, independent acts as pos-
sible bases for conviction. Under the um-
brella charge of ‘‘abuse of power,’’ Article I 
offers Senators a menu of at least four dif-
ferent bases for conviction: (1) ‘‘corruptly’’ 
requesting that Ukraine announce an inves-
tigation into the Biden-Burisma affair; (2) 
‘‘corruptly’’ requesting that Ukraine an-
nounce an investigation into alleged Ukrain-
ian interference in the 2016 election; (3) 
‘‘corrupt[ly]’’ conditioning the release of 
Ukraine’s security assistance on these inves-
tigations; and (4) ‘‘corrupt[ly]’’ conditioning 
a White House meeting on these investiga-
tions.784 Article II similarly invites Senators 
to pick and choose among at least 10 dif-
ferent bases for obstruction including: (1) di-
recting the White House and agencies, ‘‘with-
out lawful cause or excuse,’’ not to produce 
documents in response to a congressional 
subpoena; or (2) directing one or more of nine 
different individuals, ‘‘without lawful cause 
or excuse,’’ not to testify in response to a 
congressional subpoena.785 
As a result, the Articles invite the danger 
of an unconstitutional conviction if less than 
two-thirds of Senators agree that any par-
ticular act was an abuse of power or obstruc-
tion. With at least four independent bases al-
leged for abuse of power, Article I invites 
conviction if as few as 18 Senators agree that 
any one alleged act occurred and constituted 
an abuse of power. 
The deficiency in the articles cannot be 
remedied by dividing the articles, because 
that is prohibited.786 The only constitutional 
option is to reject the articles and acquit the 
President. 
CONCLUSION 
The Articles of Impeachment presented by 
House Democrats are constitutionally defi-
cient on their face. The theories underpin-
ning them would do lasting damage to the 
separation of powers under the Constitution 
and to our structure of government. The Ar-
ticles are also the product of an unprece-
dented and unconstitutional process that de-
nied the President every basic right guaran-
teed by the Due Process Clause and funda-
mental principles of fairness. These Articles 
reflect nothing more than the ‘‘persecution 
of an intemperate or designing majority in 
the House of Representatives’’ 787 that the 
Framers warned against. The Senate should 
reject the Articles of Impeachment and ac-
quit the President immediately.

Blackstone and his justly celebrated Com-

Gouverneur Morris’s comments at the Con-

digm of bribery that the Framers had in 
mind as he cited King Louis XIV of France’s 
bribe of England’s King Charles II and ar-
gued, ‘‘no one would say that we ought to ex-
pose ourselves to the danger of seeing the 
first Magistrate in foreign pay without being

and permitted to be maintained a secret in-
vestigative unit within the Office of the 
President . . . [that] engaged in covert and 
unlawful activities.’’ Id. at 3. Although the 
House Judiciary Committee’s report de-
scribed Article II generally as involving 
‘‘abuse of the powers of the office of Presi-
dent,’’ id. at 139, that was not the actual 
charge included in the articles of impeach-
ment. The actual charges in the rec-
ommended article of impeachment included 
specific violations of laws.

Historical Overview, 49 N.C. L. Rev. 87, 118

litical upheaval, Congress has refused to im-
peach a judge for lack of ‘good behaviour’ 
unless the behavior was both job-related and 
criminal.’’).

January 21, 2020 
128. U.S. Const. art. III, 1; see also John R. 
Labovitz, 
Presidential 
Impeachment 
92–93 
(1978) (The Good Behavior Clause ‘‘could be 
interpreted as a separate standard for the 
impeachment of judges or it could be inter-
preted as an aid in applying the term ‘high 
crimes and misdemeanors’ to judges. Which-
ever interpretation was adopted, it was clear 
that the clause made a difference in judicial 
impeachments, confounding the application 
of these cases to presidential impeach-
ment.’’); Clinton Senate Trial, supra note 78, 
vol. IV at 2692 (statement of Sen. Max 
Cleland) 
(citing 
the 
‘‘Good 
Behaviour’’ 
clause and explaining ‘‘that there is indeed a 
different legal standard for impeachment of 
Presidents and Federal judges’’). 
129. Amar, supra note 81, at 304. 
130. See Cass R. Sunstein, Impeaching the 
President, 147 U. Pa. L. Rev. 279, 304 (1998).

132. Clinton Senate Trial, supra note 78, vol. 
IV at 2575 (statement of Sen. Joseph R. 
Biden, Jr.). Numerous other Senators distin-
guished the lower standard for judicial im-
peachments. See, e.g., id. at 2692 (statement 
of Sen. Max Cleland) (‘‘After review of the 
record, historical precedents, and consider-
ation of the different roles of Presidents and 
Federal judges, I have concluded that there 
is indeed a different legal standard for im-
peachment 
of 
Presidents 
and 
Federal 
judges.’’); id. at 2811 (statement of Sen. Ed-
ward M. Kennedy) (‘‘Removal of the Presi-
dent of the United States and removal of a 
Federal judge are vastly different.’’). 
133. Sunstein, supra note 130, at 300; see also 
Clinton Judiciary Comm. Hearing on Back-
ground of Impeachment, supra note 76, at 350 
(statement of Professors Frank O. Bowman, 
III, Stephen L. Sepinuck, Gonzaga Univer-
sity School of Law) (‘‘[C]omparative analysis 
suggests that Congress has applied a discern-
ibly different standard to the removal of 
judges.’’). 
134. To the extent that the Senate voted in 
the impeachment trial of Judge Claiborne 
not to require all Senators to apply the be-
yond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, see 132 
Cong. Rec. 29,153 (1986), that decision in a ju-
dicial impeachment has little relevance here.

Cong. 48 (1998) (‘‘Of these distinctive fea-
tures, the one of greatest contemporary con-
cern is the founders’ choice of the words— 
treason, bribery, and other high crimes and 
misdemeanors’—for the purpose of narrowing 
the scope of the federal impeachment proc-
ess.’’)

Michael 
Gerhardt) (Clinton Judiciary Comm. Hearing 
on Background of Impeachment).

Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). 
174. Jack N. Rakove, Statement on the Back-
ground and History of Impeachment, 67 Geo. 
Wash. L. Rev. 682, 688 (1999). The Framers’ 
‘‘predominant fear’’ was ‘‘oppression at the 
hands of Congress.’’ Raoul Berger, Impeach-
ment: The Constitutional Problems 4 (1973); see 
also Consumer Energy Council of Am. v. Fed. 
Energy Regulatory Comm’n, 673 F.2d 425, 464 
(D.C. Cir. 1982) (‘‘Perhaps the greatest fear of 
the Framers was that in a representative de-
mocracy the Legislature would be capable of 
using its plenary lawmaking power to swal-
low up the other departments of the Govern-
ment.’’); Ronald C. Kahn, Process and Rights 
Principles in Modern Constitutional Theory: 
The Supreme Court and Constitutional Democ-
racy, 37 Stan. L. Rev. 253, 260 (1984) (‘‘[T]he 
Framers’ greatest fear was the unlawful use 
of legislative power.’’). The ratification de-
bates also reflected fear of Congress. Berger,

178. See supra notes 92–100 and accom-
panying text. 
179. 2 Records of the Federal Convention, 
supra note 175, at 550 (James Madison). 
180. Alexander Hamilton’s description in 
Federalist No. 65 does not support House 
Democrats’ theory of a vague abuse-of-power 
offense. In an often-cited passage, Hamilton 
observed that the subjects of impeachment 
are ‘‘offenses which proceed from the mis-
conduct of public men, or, in other words, 
from the abuse or violation of some public 
trust.’’ The Federalist No. 65, at 396 (Alex-
ander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). 
Hamilton was merely noting fundamental 
characteristics common to impeachable of-
fenses—that 
they 
involve 
(or 
‘‘proceed 
from’’) misconduct in public office or abuse 
of public trust. He was no more saying that 
‘‘abuse or violation of some public trust’’ 
provided, in itself, the definition of a charge-
able offense than he was saying that ‘‘mis-
conduct of public men’’ provided such a defi-
nition. 
181. III Hinds’ Precedents 2361, at 763 (1907) 
(Hinds’ Precedents). Justice Chase was ac-
quitted by the Senate. Id. at § 2363, at 770–71. 
He had been charged with purported offenses 
that turned largely on claims that he had 
misapplied the law in his rulings while sit-
ting as a circuit justice. See William H. 
Rehnquist, Grand Inquests 76–77, 114 (1992). 
His acquittal has been credited with having 
‘‘a profound effect on the American judici-
ary,’’ because the Senate’s rejection of the 
charges was widely viewed as ‘‘safeguard[ing] 
the independence’’ of federal judges. Id. at 
114. 
182. HJC Report at 5.

eral secondary sources, each of which ex-
tracts general categories of impeachment 
cases from specific prosecutions. See, e.g.,

impeachment cases are ‘‘reducible to intel-
ligible categories’’ including those involving 
‘‘abuse of official power’’); Staff of H.R.

grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses 
against the United States, except in Cases of 
Impeachment.’’). 
206. The offense of bribery, of course, in-
volves an element of intent, and thus requires 
some evaluation of the accused’s motiva-
tions and state of mind. See 4 Blackstone, 
Commentaries *139 (‘‘BRIBERY . . . is when a 
judge, or other person concerned in the ad-
ministration of justice, takes any undue re-
ward to influence his behavior in his of-
fice.’’). There is a wide gulf, however, be-
tween proving a specific offense such as brib-
ery that involves wrongful conduct along 
with the requisite intent and House Demo-
crats’ radical theory that any lawful action 
may be treated as an impeachable offense 
based on a characterization of subjective in-
tent alone.

dence that the President caused action—not

of the United States . . .—to cover up the 
Watergate break-in. This concealment re-
quired perjury, destruction of evidence, ob-
struction 
of 
justice—all 
of 
which 
are 
crimes.’’ Id. at 33–34. 
215. Id. at 3. While the House Judiciary 
Committee’s report described Article II gen-
erally as involving ‘‘abuse of the powers of 
the office of President,’’ id. at 139, it is sig-
nificant that the actual charge the Judiciary 
Committee specified in the recommended ar-
ticle of impeachment was not framed in 
terms of that amorphous concept. To the 
contrary, the article of impeachment itself 
charged unlawful actions and dropped the 
vague terminology of ‘‘abuse of power.’’ 
216. 
The 
third 
recommended 
article 
charged President Nixon with defying con-
gressional subpoenas ‘‘without lawful cause 
or excuse’’ and asserted that the President 
had violated the assignment of the ‘‘sole 
power of impeachment’’ to the House by re-
sisting subpoenas. Id. at 4. It also provides no 
precedent for House Democrats’ abuse-of- 
power theory. 
217. See, e.g., Debate on Articles of Impeach-
ment: Hearings Before the H.R. Comm. on the 
Judiciary, 93d Cong. 412 (1974) (statement of 
Rep. Don Edwards) (‘‘[A]rticle II charges

222. Even the source they cite undermines 
House Democrats’ theories. Tribe and Matz 
explain that one of the most important les-
sons from Johnson’s impeachment is ‘‘it 
really does matter which acts are identified 
in articles of impeachment’’ and that im-
peachment proceedings are ‘‘technical and 
legalistic.’’ Laurence Tribe & Joshua Matz, 
To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeach-
ment 54 (2018). 
223. Benedict, supra note 190, at 102. Even if 
President Johnson’s impeachment did sup-
port House Democrats’ novel theory—which 
it does not—it does not provide a model to be 
emulated. As House Democrats’ hand-picked 
expert, Professor Michael Gerhardt, has ex-
plained, the Johnson impeachment is a ‘‘du-
bious precedent’’ because it is ‘‘widely re-
garded as perhaps the most intensely par-
tisan impeachment rendered by the House’’— 
at least until now. Michael J. Gerhardt, The 
Federal Impeachment Process 179 (3d ed. 2019); 
see also Berger, supra note 174, at 295 (‘‘The 
impeachment and trial of Andrew Johnson, 
to my mind, represent a gross abuse of the 
impeachment 
process. . . .’’);

Turley, Democrats Repeat Failed History with 
Mad Dash to Impeach Donald Trump, The Hill 
(Dec. 17, 2019), https://perma.cc/4Y3X-FCBW 
(‘‘The Johnson case has long been widely re-
garded as the very prototype of an abusive 
impeachment. . . . Some critics have actu-
ally cited Johnson as precedent to show that 
impeachment can be done on purely political 
grounds. In other words, the very reason the 
Johnson impeachment is condemned by his-
tory is now being used today as a justifica-
tion to dispense with standards and defini-
tions of impeachable acts.’’).

261. Nothing in the recent decision in In re 
Application of Committee on the Judiciary es-
tablishes that a committee can pursue an in-
vestigation pursuant to the impeachment 
power without authorization by a vote from 
the House. SeellF. Supp. 3dll, 2019 WL 
5485221, at *26–28 (D.D.C. Oct. 25, 2019). Any 
such discussion was dicta. The question be-
fore the court was whether a particular Judi-
ciary Committee inquiry was being con-
ducted ‘‘preliminarily to’’ an impeachment 
trial in the Senate, a question that the court 
viewed as depending on the inquiry’s ‘‘pur-
pose’’ and whether it could lead to such a 
trial—‘‘not the source of authority Congress 
acts under.’’ Id. at *28 n.37. In any event, the 
court’s analysis was flawed. 
First, the court, like the Committees, mis-
read a House annotation to Jefferson’s Man-
ual. See, e.g., Letter from Elijah E. Cum-
mings, Chairman, House Oversight Com-
mittee, et al., to John Michael Mulvaney, 
Acting White House Chief of Staff, at 2 (Oct. 
4, 2019). The language quoted by the court 
states that ‘‘various events have been cred-
ited with setting an impeachment in mo-
tion.’’ H. Doc. 114–192, 114th Cong. § 603 (2017). 
But that does not mean that any of these 
‘‘various events’’ automatically confers au-
thority on a committee to begin an impeach-
ment inquiry. It merely acknowledges the 
historical fact that there is more than one 
way the House may receive information that 
may prompt the House to then authorize a 
committee to pursue an impeachment inves-
tigation. 
Second, the court misread III Hinds’ Prece-
dents § 2400 as showing that ‘‘a resolution 
‘authoriz[ing]’ HJC ‘to inquire into the offi-
cial conduct of Andrew Johnson’ was passed 
after HJC ‘was already considering the sub-
ject.’ ’’ Id. at *27. That section discusses two 
House votes on two separate resolutions that 
occurred weeks apart. The House first voted 
to authorize the Johnson inquiry (which the 
court missed), and it then voted to refer a 
second matter (the resolution cited by the 
court), which touched upon President John-
son’s impeachment, ‘‘to the Committee on 
the Judiciary, which was already considering 
the subject.’’ III Hinds’ Precedents § 2400. The 
court also misread the Nixon precedent as 
involving an ‘‘investigation well before the 
House passed a resolution authorizing an im-
peachment inquiry.’’ In re Application of the 
Comm. on the Judiciary, 2019 WL 5485221, at 
*27. But that pre-resolution work did not in-
volve any exercise of the House’s impeach-
ment power and was instead limited to pre-
liminary, self-organizing work conducting 
‘‘research into the constitutional issue of de-
fining the grounds for impeachment’’ and 
‘‘collecting and sifting the evidence avail-
able in the public domain.’’ Staff of H.R. 
Comm. 
on 
the 
Judiciary, 
Constitutional 
Grounds for Presidential Impeachment, 93d 
Cong. 1–3 (Comm. Print 1974). The Chairman 
of the Committee himself acknowledged 
that, to actually launch an inquiry, a House 
resolution ‘‘is a necessary step.’’ 120 Cong. 
Rec. 2351 (Feb. 6, 1974 statement of Rep. Ro-
dino). 
Third, the court misread House Resolution 
430, which was adopted on June 11, 2019. The 
court plucked out language from the resolu-
tion granting the Judiciary Committee ‘‘any 
and all necessary authority under Article I 
of the Constitution,’’ as if to suggest that 
the Judiciary Committee could, under that 
grant, initiate an impeachment inquiry. In re 
Application of Comm. on Judiciary, 2019 WL 
5485221, at *29 (quoting H.R. Res. 430, 116th 
Cong. (2019)). But House Resolution 430 is ac-
tually much more narrow. After providing 
certain authorizations for filing lawsuits, 
the resolution simply gave committees au-
thority to pursue litigation effectively by 
providing that, ‘‘in connection with any judi-
cial proceeding brought under the first or sec-
ond resolving clauses, the chair of any stand-
ing or permanent select committee exer-
cising authority thereunder has any and all 
necessary authority under Article I of the 
Constitution.’’ 
H.R 
Res. 
430 
(emphasis 
added). Simply by providing authority to 
pursue lawsuits, House Resolution 430 did 
not authorize any committee to initiate an 
impeachment investigation. 
262. Clerk, House of Representatives, Rules 
of the House of Representatives, 116th Cong. 
(2019) (H.R. Rule). 
263. H.R. Rule X.1(l)(18). 
264. H.R. Rule X.1(n)(5). 
265. H.R. Rule XI.1(b)(1) (limiting the 
power to conduct ‘‘investigations and stud-
ies’’ to those ‘‘necessary or appropriate in 
the exercise of its responsibilities under rule 
X’’); H.R. Rule XI.2(m)(1) (limiting the power 
to hold hearings and issue subpoenas to ‘‘the 
purpose of carrying out any of [the commit-
tee’s] functions and duties under this rule 
and rule X (including any matters referred to 
it under clause 2 of rule XII)’’). 
266. The mere referral of an impeachment 
resolution by itself could not authorize a 
committee to begin an impeachment in-
quiry. The ‘‘Speaker’s referral authority 
under Rule XII is . . . limited to matters 
within a committee’s Rule X legislative ju-
risdiction’’ and ‘‘may not expand the juris-
diction of a committee by referring a bill or 
resolution falling outside the committee’s 
Rule X legislative authority.’’ Impeachment 
Inquiry Authorization, infra Appendix C, at 30; 
see H.R. Rule XII.2(a); 18 Deschler’s Prece-
dents of the House of Representatives, app. 
at 578 (1994) (Deschler’s Precedents). If a 
mere referral could authorize an impeach-
ment inquiry, then a single House member 
could trigger the delegation of the House’s 
‘‘sole Power of Impeachment’’ to a com-
mittee and thus, for the House’s most serious 
investigations, end-run Rule XI.1(b)(1)’s limi-
tation of committee investigations to the 
committees’ jurisdiction under Rule X.

That language was stripped from the reso-
lution by an amendment, see 120 Cong. Rec. 
32,968–72 (1974), the amended resolution was 
adopted, id. at 34,469–70, and impeachment 
has remained outside the scope of any stand-
ing committee’s jurisdiction ever since. Cf. 
Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 117–18

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S343 
January 21, 2020 
The House accepted and ratified this advice 
in its first impeachment the next year and in 
each of the next twelve impeachments of 
judges and subordinate executive officers. III 
Hinds’ Precedents §§ 2297, 2300, 2321, 2323, 
2342, 2364, 2385, 2444–2445, 2447–2448, 2469, 2504; 
VI Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Rep-
resentatives §§ 498, 513, 544 (1936) (Cannon’s 
Precedents); 3 Deschler’s Precedents ch. 14, 
§ 18.1. In some cases before 1870, such as the 
impeachment of Judge Pickering, the House 
relied on information presented directly to 
the House to impeach an official before con-
ducting an inquiry, and then authorized a 
committee to draft specific articles of im-
peachment and exercise investigatory pow-
ers. III Hinds’ Precedents § 2321. Those few 
cases adhere to the rule that a vote of the 
full House is necessary to authorize any 
committee to investigate for impeachment 
purposes. 
277. H.R. Comm. on the Judiciary, Impeach-
ment of Walter L. Nixon, Jr., H.R. Rep. No. 101– 
36, 101st Cong. 12–13 (1989) (Judge Nixon Jr.); 
H.R. Comm. on the Judiciary, Impeachment of 
Judge Alcee L. Hastings, H.R. Rep. No. 100–810, 
100th Cong. 7–8, 29–31, 38–39 (1988) (Judge Has-
tings); H.R. Comm. on the Judiciary, Im-
peachment of Judge Harry E. Claiborne, H.R. 
Rep. No. 99–688, 99th Cong. 18–20 (1986) (Judge 
Claiborne). These aberrations are still distin-
guishable because the House adopted resolu-
tions authorizing subpoenas for depositions 
during the impeachment investigations of 
Judges Nixon and Hastings, see H.R. Res. 562, 
100th Cong. (1988); H.R. Res. 320, 100th Cong. 
(1987), and the Judiciary Committee appar-
ently did not issue any subpoenas in Judge 
Claiborne’s impeachment inquiry.

(2014); see also Impeachment Inquiry Authoriza-

280. H.R. Rep. No. 105–830, at 265 (Minority 
Views). 
281. See Impeachment Inquiry Authorization, 
infra Appendix C, at 1–3. Although the com-
mittees also referred to their oversight and 
legislative jurisdiction in issuing these sub-
poenas, the committees cannot ‘‘leverage 
their oversight jurisdiction to require the 
production of documents and testimony that 
the committees avowedly intended to use for 
an unauthorized impeachment inquiry.’’ Id. 
at 32–33. These ‘‘assertion[s] of dual authori-
ties’’ were merely ‘‘token invocations of 
‘oversight 
and 
legislative 
jurisdiction,’ ’’ 
without ‘‘any apparent legislative purpose.’’ 
Id. The committees transmitted the sub-
poenas ‘‘[p]ursuant to the House[’s] impeach-
ment inquiry,’’ admitted that documents 
would ‘‘be collected as part of the House’s 
impeachment inquiry,’’ and confirmed that 
they would be ‘‘shared among the Commit-
tees, as well as with the Committee on the 
Judiciary as appropriate’’—all to be used in 
the impeachment inquiry. E.g., Letter from

mental powers among three departments, to 
save the people from autocracy.’’); The Fed-

(Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (arguing that 
‘‘liberty’’ requires that the government’s 
‘‘constituent parts . . . be the means of keep-
ing each other in their proper places’’). 
332. United States v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 567 
F.2d 121, 127 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (when Congress 
asks for information from the Executive 
Branch, that request triggers the ‘‘implicit 
constitutional mandate to seek optimal ac-
commodation . . . of the needs of the con-
flicting branches.’’). 
333. Id. at 130. 
334. Congressional Requests for Confidential 
Executive Branch Information, 13 Op. O.L.C. 
153, 162 (1989) (‘‘If after assertion of executive 
privilege the committee remains unsatisfied 
with the agency’s response, it may vote to 
hold the agency head in contempt of Con-
gress.’’). 
335. As the Minority Views on the House 
Judiciary Committee’s Report in the Nixon 
proceedings pointed out, it is important to 
have a body other than the committee that 
issued a subpoena evaluate the subpoena be-
fore there is a move to contempt. ‘‘[I]f the 
Committee were to act as the final arbiter of 
the legality of its own demand, the result 
would seldom be in doubt. . . . It is for the 
reason just stated that, when a witness be-
fore a Congressional Committee refuses to 
give testimony or produce documents, the 
Committee cannot itself hold the witness in 
contempt. . . . Rather, the established pro-
cedure is for the witness to be given an op-
portunity to appear before the full House or 
Senate, as the case may be, and give reasons, 
if he can, why he should not be held in con-
tempt.’’ H.R. Rep. No. 93–1305, at 484 (1974) 
(Minority Views); see also id. at 516 (addi-
tional views of Rep. William Cohen). 
336. As examples of such lawsuits, see 
Compl., Comm. on Oversight and Gov’t Reform 
v. Holder, No. 1:12–cv–1332 (D.D.C. August 13, 
2012), ECF No. 1 (suing to enforce subpoenas 
in the Fast and Furious investigation during 
the Obama Administration); Compl., Comm. 
on the Judiciary v. McGahn, No. 19–cv–2379 
(D.D.C. Aug. 7, 2019), ECF No. 1. Addition-
ally, for Senate subpoenas, Congress has af-
firmatively passed legislation creating sub-
ject matter jurisdiction in federal court to 
hear such cases. See 28 U.S.C. §1365 (2018). The 
Trump Administration, like the Obama Ad-
ministration, has taken the position that a 
suit by a congressional committee attempt-
ing to enforce a subpoena against an Execu-
tive Branch official is not a justiciable con-
troversy in an Article III court. See Comm. on 
Oversight & Gov’t Reform v. Holder, 979 F. 
Supp. 2d 1, 9–10 (D.D.C. 2013) (‘‘The defendant 
. . . maintains that Article III of the Con-
stitution actually prohibits the Court from 
exercising jurisdiction over what he charac-
terizes 
as 
‘an 
inherently 
political 
dis-
pute.’ ’’). The House of Representatives, how-
ever, has taken the opposite view. See Pl.’s 
Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss, Comm. on 
Oversight & Gov’t Reform v. Holder, No. 12–cv– 
1332 (D.D.C. Nov. 21, 2012), ECF No. 17. Unless 
and until the justiciability question is re-
solved by the Supreme Court, the House can-
not simultaneously (i) insist that the courts 
may decide whether any particular refusal to 
comply with a congressional committee’s de-
mand for information was legally proper and 
(ii) claim that the House can treat resistance 
to any demand for information from Con-
gress as a ‘‘high crime and misdemeanor’’ 
justifying impeachment without securing any 
judicial determination that the Executive 
Branch’s action was improper. 
337. See Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 567 F.2d at 127 
(‘‘[E]ach branch should take cognizance of an 
implicit constitutional mandate to seek op-
timal accommodation through a realistic 
evaluation of the needs of the conflicting 
branches in the particular fact situation.’’).

Cipollone, supra note 291, at 8. 
354. History of Refusals, 6 O.L.C. Op. at 771 
(‘‘President Truman issued a directive pro-
viding for the confidentiality of all loyalty 
files and requiring that all requests for such 
files from sources outside the Executive 
Branch be referred to the Office of the Presi-
dent, for such response as the President may 
determine .
.
. At a press conference held 
on April 22, 1948, President Truman indicated 
that he would not comply with the request 
to turn the papers over to the Committee.’’ 
(citations omitted)); id. at 769 (noting Presi-
dent Coolidge refused to provide the Senate 
‘‘a list of all companies in which the Sec-
retary of the Treasury was interested’ ’’ and 
instead sent a letter ‘‘calling the Senate’s in-
vestigation an ‘unwarranted intrusion,’ born 
of a desire other than to secure information 
for legitimate legislative purposes’’ (quoting 
65 Cong. Rec. 6087 (1924))); id. at 757 (noting 
President Jackson refused to provide to the 
Senate a paper purportedly read by the 
President to his Cabinet and instead asserted 
‘‘the Legislature had no constitutional au-
thority to ‘require of me an account of any 
communication, either verbally or in writ-
ing, made to the heads of Departments act-
ing as a Cabinet council .
.
. [nor] might I 
be required to detail to the Senate the free 
and private conversations I have held with 
those officers on any subject relating to 
their duties and my own.’ ’’). 
355. As explained above, many of the sub-
poenas were not authorized as part of any 
impeachment inquiry because they were 
issued when the House had not voted to au-
thorize any such inquiry. See supra Part 
I.B.1(a). 
356. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 707. 
357. See, e.g., Trial Mem. of the U.S. House 
of Representatives at 33–34; HJC Report at 
136–37. 
358. House Democrats’ reliance on Kilbourn 
v. Thompson is misplaced. Kilbourn merely 
states that, when conducting an impeach-
ment inquiry, the House or Senate may 
‘‘compel the attendance of witnesses, and 
their answer to proper questions, in the same 
manner and by the use of the same means 
that courts of justice can in like cases.’ ’’ 
Trial Mem. of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives at 32 (quoting Kilbourn, 103 U.S. 168, 190 
(1880)). But constitutionally based privileges 
apply in ‘‘courts of justice,’’ so Kilbourn does 
not foreclose the assertion of privileges and 
immunities in impeachment proceedings. Re-
gardless, the statement quoted by House 
Democrats is dictum and, therefore, not 
binding. 
Additionally, 
House 
Democrats 
point to an 1846 statement by President Polk 
to support the proposition that ‘‘[p]revious 
Presidents have acknowledged their obliga-
tion to comply with an impeachment inves-
tigation.’’ Id. at 32–33. OLC has clarified 
that, when read in context, President Polk’s 
statement actually ‘‘acknowledg[es] the con-
tinued availability of executive privilege’’ 
because President Polk explained that ‘‘even 
in the impeachment context, the Executive 
branch would adopt all wise precautions to 
prevent the exposure of all such matters the 
publication of which might injuriously affect 
the public interest, except so far as this 
might be necessary to accomplish the great 
ends of public justice.’ ’’ Impeachment Inquiry 
Authorization, infra Appendix C, at 11 n.13

Attorney General, from Robert G. Dixon, Jr.,

Counsel, Re: Presidential Immunity from Coer-

382. Memorandum from Steven A. Engel, 
Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal 
Counsel, to Pat A. Cipollone, Counsel to the 
President, Re: House Committees’ Authority to 
Investigate for Impeachment, at 1 (Jan. 19, 
2020) (emphasis in original) (Impeachment In-
quiry Authorization), infra Appendix C. 
383. Impeachment is not just a political 
process unconstrained by law. ‘‘The subjects 
of [an impeachment trial] are those offenses 
which proceed from the misconduct of public 
men, or, in other words, from the abuse or 
violation of some public trust’’—that is, 
‘‘POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to inju-
ries done immediately to the society itself.’’ 
The Federalist No. 65, at 396 (Alexander 
Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But 
‘‘Hamilton didn’t say the process of impeach-
ment is entirely political. He said the offense 
has to be political.’’ Alan M. Dershowitz, 
Hamilton Wouldn’t Impeach Trump, Wall St. J. 
(Oct. 9, 2019), https://perma.cc/97PH-QPGT 
(emphasis in original). ‘‘Hamilton’s descrip-
tion in Federalist 65 should not be taken to 
mean that impeachments have a conven-
tional political nature, unmoored from tradi-
tional 
criminal 
process.’’ 
J. 
Richard 
Broughton, Conviction, Nullification, and 
the Limits of Impeachment As Politics, 68 
Case W. Res. L. Rev. 275, 288 (2017). Federalist 
No. 65 goes to ‘‘pains to show that the Senate 
can act in ‘their judicial character as a 
‘court for the trial of impeachments,’’ and 
‘‘[t]he entire essay is an attempt to show 
that the Senate can overcome its political na-
ture as an elected body .
.
. and act as a 
proper court for the trial of impeach-
ments.’ ’’ Charles L. Black, Jr. & Philip 
Bobbitt, Impeachment: A Handbook 102 (2018) 
(emphasis in original). Hamilton emphasized 
that impeachment and removal of ‘‘the ac-
cused’’ must be based on partially legal con-
siderations involving ‘‘real demonstrations 
of innocence or guilt’’ rather than purely po-
litical 
factors 
like 
‘‘the 
comparative 
strength of parties.’’ Id. at 102–03 (quoting 
The Federalist No. 65). Thus, ‘‘one should not 
diminish the significance of impeachment’s 
legal aspects, particularly as they relate to 
the formalities of the criminal justice proc-
ess. It is a hybrid of the political and the 
legal, a political process moderated by legal

simply ‘a bad guy,’ .

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S353 
January 21, 2020 
California, 73d Cong., 839–40 (1933) (statement 
of Sen. Josiah Bailey). 
Although the Senate has convicted a few 
lower court judges on duplicitous articles, 
those convictions provide no precedent to 
follow here. First, no duplicity objection ap-
pears to have been timely raised in those 
cases before the votes on conviction, and 
thus the Senate never squarely faced and de-
cided the issue. See, e.g., 80 Cong. Rec. 5606 
(1936) (parliamentary inquiry based on du-
plicity raised only by a Senator after Judge 
Ritter was convicted). 
Second, far from being examples to follow, 
these judges’ convictions only illustrate the 
constitutional danger of umbrella charges, 
which allow the form of the articles chosen 
by the House, rather than actual guilt or in-
nocence, to determine conviction. Judge Rit-
ter, for example, was charged with discrete 
impeachable acts in separate articles, with a 
catch-all article combining all of the prior 
articles tacked on. He was acquitted on each 
separate article, but convicted on the catch- 
all article that amounted to a charge of 
‘‘general misbehavior.’’ Id. at 5202–06. 
Third, that the Senate may have convicted 
a few lower court judges on duplicitous arti-
cles is hardly precedent to be followed in a 
presidential impeachment. See supra Stand-
ards Part B.3.

786. Rules of Procedure and Practice in the 
Senate when Sitting on Impeachment Trials, 
Rule XXIII (‘‘An article of impeachment 
shall not be divisible for the purpose of vot-
ing thereon at any time during the trial.’’). 
The committee report accompanying this 
rule made clear that the ‘‘more familiar’’ 
practice was to ‘‘embod[y] an impeachable 
offense in an individual article’’ rather than 
relying on broad, potentially duplicitous ar-
ticles. Amending the Rules of Procedure and

APPENDIX A 
MEMORANDUM OF JULY 25, 2019 TELE-
PHONE 
CONVERSATION 
BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKYY 
MEMORANDUM OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION 
Subject: Telephone Conversation with Presi-
dent Zelensky of Ukraine. 
Participants: President Zelensky of Ukraine. 
Notetakers: The White House Situation 
Room. 
Date, Time and Place: July 25, 2019, 9:03–9:33 
a.m. EDT, Residence. 
The President: Congratulations on a great 
victory. We all watched from the United 
States and you did a terrific job. The way 
you came from behind, somebody who wasn’t 
given much of a chance, and you ended up 
winning easily. It’s a fantastic achievement. 
Congratulations. 
President Zelensky : You are absolutely 
right Mr . President. We did win big and we 
worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I 
would like to confess to you that I had an op-
portunity to learn from you. We used quite a 
few of your skills and knowledge and were 
able to use it as an example for our elections 
and yes it is true that these were unique 
elections. We were in a unique situation that 
we were able to achieve a unique success. I’m 
able to tell you the following; the first time, 
you called me to congratulate me when I 
won my presidential election, and the second 
time you are now calling me when my party 
won the parliamentary election. I think I 
should run more often so you can call me 
more often and we can talk over the phone 
more often. 
The President: [laughter] That’s a very 
good idea. I think your country is very 
happy about that. 
President Zelensky: Well yes, to tell you 
the truth, we are trying to work hard be-
cause we wanted to drain the swamp here in 
our country. We brought in many many new 
people. Not the old politicians, not the typ-
ical politicians, because we want to have a 
new format and a new type of government. 
You are a great teacher for us and in that. 
The President: Well it’s very nice of you to 
say that. I will say that we do a lot for 
Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of 
time. Much more than the European coun-
tries are doing and they should be helping 
you more than they are. Germany does al-
most nothing for you. All they do is talk and 
I think it’s something that you should really 
ask them about. When I was speaking to An-
gela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she 
doesn’t do anything. A lot of the European 
countries are the same way so I think it’s 
something you want to look at but the 
United States has been very very good to 
Ukraine. I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal 
necessarily because things are happening 
that are not good but the United States has 
been very very good to Ukrane. 
President Zelensky: Yes you are absolutely 
right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and 
I can tell you the following; I did talk to An-
gela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also 
met and talked with Macron and I told them 
that they are not doing quite as much as 
they need to be doing on the issues with the 
sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanc-
tions. They are not working as much as they 
should work for Ukraine. It turns out that 
even though logically, the European Union 
should be our biggest partner but technically 
the United States is a much bigger partner 
than the European Union and I’m very grate-
ful to you for that because the United States 
is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more 
than the European Union especially when we 
are talking about sanctions against the Rus-
sian Federation. I would also like to thank 
you for your great support in the area of de-
fense. We are ready to continue to cooperate 
for the next steps specifically we are almost 
ready to buy more Javelins from the United 
States for defense purposes.

tions and variations in accent and/or inter-

indicate portions of a conversation that the 
notetaker was unable to hear. 
The President: I would like you to do us a 
favor though because our country has been 
through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about 
it. I would like you to find out what hap-
pened 
with 
this 
whole 
situation 
with 
Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. . . I guess 
you have one of your wealthy people. . . The 
server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a 
lot of things that went on, the whole situa-
tion. I think you’re surrounding yourself 
with some of the same people. I would like to 
have the Attorney General call you or your 
people and I would like you to get to the bot-
tom of it As you saw yesterday, that whole 
nonsense ended with a very poor perform-
ance by a man named Robert Mueller, an in-
competent performance, but they say a lot of 
it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can 
do, it’s very important that you do it if 
that’s possible. 
President Zelensky: Yes it is very impor-
tant for me and everything that you just 
mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it 
is very important and we are open for any fu-
ture cooperation. We are ready to open a new 
page on cooperation in relations between the 
United States and Ukraine. For that pur-
pose, I just recalled our ambassador from 
United States and he will be replaced by a 
very competent and very experienced ambas-
sador who will work hard on making sure 
that our two nations are getting closer. I 
would also like and hope to see him having 
your trust and your confidence and have per-
sonal relatives with you so we can cooperate 
even more so. I will personally tell you that 
one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani 
just recently and we are hoping very much 
that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to 
Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to 
Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once 
again that you have nobody but friends 
around us. I will make sure that I surround 
myself with he best and most experienced 
people. I also wanted to tell you that we are 
friends. We are great friends and you Mr. 
President have friends in our country so we 
can continue our strategic partnership. I 
also plan to surround myself with great peo-
ple and in addition to that investigation, I 
guarantee as the President of Ukraine that 
all the investigations will be done openly 
and candidly. That I can assure you. 
The President: Good because I heard you 
had a prosecutor who was very good and he 
was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot 
of people are talking about that, the way 
they shut your very good prosecutor down 
and you had some very bad people involved. 
Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He 
was the mayor of New York City, a great 
mayor, and I would like him to call you. I 
will ask him to call you along with the At-
torney General. Rudy very much knows 
what’s happening and he is a very capable 
guy. If you could speak to him that would be 
great. The former ambassador from the 
United States, the woman, was bad news and 
the people she was dealing with in the 
Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let 
you know that. The other thing. There’s a 
lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden 
stopped the prosecution and a lot of people 
want to find out about that so whatever you 
can do with the Attorney General would be 
great. Biden went around bragging that he 
stopped the prosecution so if you can look 
into it. . . It sounds horrible to me. 
President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you 
about the prosecutor. First of all I under-
stand and I’m knowledgeable about the situ-
ation. Since we have won the absolute ma-
jority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor 
general will be 100% my person, my can-
didate, who will be approved by the par-
liament and will start as a new prosecutor in 
September. He or she will look into the situ-
ation, specifically to the company that you 
mentioned in this issue. The issue of the in-
vestigation of the case is actually the issue 
of making sure to restore the honesty so we 
will take care of that and will work on the 
investigation of the case. On top of that, I 
would kindly ask you if you have any addi-
tional information that you can provide to 
us, it would be very helpful for the investiga-
tion to make sure that we administer justice 
in our country with regard to the Ambas-
sador to the United States from Ukraine as 
far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It 
was great that you were the first one who 
told me that she was a bad ambassador be-
cause I agree with you 100%. Her attitude to-
wards me was far from the best as she ad-
mired the previous President and she was on 
his side. She would not accept me as a new 
President well enough. 
The President: Well, she’s going to go 
through some things. I will have Mr.

Giuliani give you a call and I am also going 
to have Attorney General Barr call and we 
will get to the bottom of it. I’m sure you will 
figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was 
treated very badly and he was a very fair 
prosecutor so good luck with everything. 
Your economy is going to get better and bet-
ter I predict. You have a lot of assets. It’s a 
great country. I have many Ukrainian 
friends, their incredible people. 
President Zelensky: I would like to tell 
you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian 
friends that live in the United States. Actu-
ally last time I traveled to the United 
States, I stayed in New York near Central 
Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will 
talk to them and I hope to see them again in 
the future. I also wanted to thank you for 
your invitation to visit the United States, 
specifically Washington DC. On the other 
hand, I also want to ensure you that we will 
be very serious about the case and will work 
on the investigation. As to the economy, 
there is much potential for our two countries 
and one of the issues that is very important 
for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe 
we can be very successful and cooperating on 
energy independence with United States. We 
are already working on cooperation. We are 
buying American oil but I am very hopeful 
for a future meeting. We will have more time 
and more opportunities to discuss these op-
portunities and get to know each other bet-
ter. I would like to thank you very much for 
your support 
The President: Good. Well, thank you very 
much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy 
and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank 
you. Whenever you would like to come to the 
White House, feel free to call. Give us a date 
and we’ll work that out. I look forward to 
seeing you. 
President Zelensky: Thank you very much. 
I would be very happy to come and would be 
happy to meet with you personally and get 
to know you better. I am looking forward to 
our meeting and I also would like to invite 
you to visit Ukraine and come to the city of 
Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a 
beautiful country which would welcome you. 
On the other hand, I believe that on Sep-
tember 1 we will be in Poland and we can 
meet in Poland hopefully. After that, it 
might be a very good idea for you to travel 
to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and 
go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, 
which is probably much better than mine. 
The President: Okay, we can work that 
out. I look forward to seeing you in Wash-
ington and maybe in Poland because I think 
we are going to be there at that time. 
President Zelensky: Thank you very much 
Mr. President. 
The President: Congratulations on a fan-
tastic job you’ve done. The whole world was 
watching. I’m not sure it was so much of an 
upset but congratulations.

dent bye-bye.

OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, MEMO-
RANDUM OPINION RE: HOUSE COMMIT-
TEES’ AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE 
FOR IMPEACHMENT (JAN. 19, 2019) 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 
OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, 
Washington, DC, January 19, 2020. 
MEMORANDUM FOR PAT A. CIPOLLONE 
COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT 
Re: House Committees’ Authority to Investigate 
for Impeachment 
On September 24, 2019, Speaker of the 
House Nancy Pelosi ‘‘announc[ed]’’ at a press 
conference that ‘‘the House of Representa-
tives is moving forward with an official im-
peachment inquiry’’ into the President’s ac-
tions and that she was ‘‘directing . . . six 
Committees to proceed with’’ several pre-
viously pending ‘‘investigations under that 
umbrella of impeachment inquiry.’’ 1 Shortly 
thereafter, the House Committee on Foreign 
Affairs issued a subpoena directing the Sec-
retary of State to produce a series of docu-
ments related to the recent conduct of diplo-
macy 
between 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Ukraine. See Subpoena of the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs (Sept. 27, 2019). In an accom-
panying letter, three committee chairmen 
stated that their committees jointly sought 
these documents, not in connection with leg-
islative oversight, but ‘‘[p]ursuant to the 
House of Representatives’ impeachment in-
quiry.’’ 2 In the following days, the commit-
tees issued subpoenas to the Acting White 
House Chief of Staff, the Secretary of De-
fense, the Secretary of Energy, and several 
others within the Executive Branch. 
Upon the issuance of these subpoenas, you 
asked whether these committees could com-
pel the production of documents and testi-
mony in furtherance of an asserted impeach-
ment inquiry. We advised that the commit-
tees lacked such authority because, at the 
time the subpoenas were issued, the House 
had not adopted any resolution authorizing 
the committees to conduct an impeachment 
inquiry. The Constitution vests the ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ in the House of Rep-
resentatives. U.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 5. For 
precisely that reason, the House itself must 
authorize an impeachment inquiry, as it has 
done in virtually every prior impeachment 
investigation in our Nation’s history, includ-
ing every one involving a President. A con-
gressional committee’s ‘‘right to exact testi-
mony and to call for the production of docu-
ments’’ is limited by the ‘‘controlling char-
ter’’ the committee has received from the 
House. United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 44 
(1953). Yet the House, by its rules, has au-
thorized its committees to issue subpoenas 
only for matters within their legislative juris-
diction. Accordingly, no committee may un-
dertake the momentous move from legisla-
tive oversight to impeachment without a 
delegation by the full House of such author-
ity. 
We are not the first to reach this conclu-
sion. This was the position of the House in 
the impeachments of Presidents Nixon and 
Clinton. In the case of President Nixon, fol-
lowing a preliminary inquiry, the House 
adopted a formal resolution as a ‘‘necessary 
step’’ to confer the ‘‘investigative powers’’ of 
the House ‘‘to their full extent’’ upon the Ju-
diciary Committee. 120 Cong. Rec. 2350–51 
(1974) (statement of Rep. Rodino); see H.R. 
Res. 803, 93d Cong. (1974). As the House Par-
liamentarian explained, it had been ‘‘consid-
ered necessary for the House to specifically 
vest the Committee on the Judiciary with 
the investigatory and subpena power to con-
duct the impeachment investigation.’’ 3 
Lewis Deschler, Deschler’s Precedents of the 
United States House of Representatives ch. 14, 
§ 5.2, at 2172 (1994) (Parliamentarian’s Note).3 
The House followed the same course in the 
impeachment of President Clinton. After re-
viewing the Independent Counsel’s referral, 
the Judiciary Committee ‘‘decided that it 
must receive authorization from the full 
House before proceeding on any further 
course of action.’’ H.R. Rep. No. 105–795, at 24 
(1998). The House again adopted a resolution 
authorizing the committee to issue compul-
sory process in support of an impeachment 
investigation. See H.R. Res. 581, 105th Cong. 
(1998). As Representative John Conyers sum-
marized in 2016: ‘‘According to parliamentar-
ians of the House past and present, the im-
peachment process does not begin until the 
House actually votes to authorize [a] Com-
mittee to investigate the charges.’’ 4 
In marked contrast with these historical 
precedents, in the weeks after the Speaker’s 
announcement, House committees issued 
subpoenas without any House vote author-
izing them to exercise the House’s authority 
under the Impeachment Clause. The three 
committees justified the subpoenas based 
upon the Rules of the House, which authorize 
subpoenas for matters within a committee’s 
jurisdiction. But the Rules assign only ‘‘leg-
islative jurisdiction[ ]’’ and ‘‘oversight re-
sponsibilities’’ 
to 
the 
committees. 
H.R. 
Rules, 116th Cong., Rule X, cl. 1 (Jan. 11, 
2019) (‘‘Committees and their legislative ju-
risdictions’’), cl. 2 (‘‘General oversight re-
sponsibilities’’); see also H.R. Rule X, cls.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S355 
January 21, 2020 
3(m), 11. The House’s legislative power is dis-
tinct from its impeachment power. Compare 
U.S. Const. art. I. § 1, with id. art. I, § 2, cl. 5. 
Although committees had that same delega-
tion during the Clinton impeachment and a 
materially similar one during the Nixon im-
peachment, the House determined on both 
occasions that the Judiciary Committee re-
quired a resolution to investigate. Speaker 
Pelosi purported to direct the committees to 
conduct an ‘‘official impeachment inquiry,’’ 
but the House Rules do not give the Speaker 
any authority to delegate investigative 
power. The committees thus had no delega-
tion authorizing them to issue subpoenas 
pursuant to the House’s impeachment power. 
In the face of objections to the validity of 
the committee subpoenas that were ex-
pressed by the Administration, by ranking 
minority members in the House, and by 
many Senators, among others, on October 31, 
2019, the House adopted Resolution 660, 
which ‘‘directed’’ six committees ‘‘to con-
tinue their ongoing investigations’’ as part 
of the ‘‘existing House of Representatives in-
quiry into whether sufficient grounds exist’’ 
to impeach President Trump. H.R. Res. 660, 
116th Cong. § 1 (2019). Resolution 660’s direc-
tion, however, was entirely prospective. The 
resolution did not purport to ratify any pre-
viously issued subpoenas or even make any 
mention of them. Accordingly, the pre-Octo-
ber 31 subpoenas, which had not been author-
ized by the House, continued to lack compul-
sory force.5 
I. 
Since the start of the 116th Congress, some 
members of Congress have proposed that the 
House investigate and impeach President 
Trump. On January 3, 2019, the first day of 
the new Congress, Representative Brad Sher-
man introduced a resolution to impeach 
‘‘Donald John Trump, President of the 
United States, for high crimes and mis-
demeanors.’’ H.R. Res. 13, 116th Cong. (2019). 
The Sherman resolution called for impeach-
ment based upon the President’s firing of the 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, James Comey. See id. Consistent with 
settled practice, the resolution was referred 
to the Judiciary Committee. See H.R. Doc. 
No. 115–177, Jefferson’s Manual § 605, at 324 
(2019). 
The Judiciary Committee did not act on 
the Sherman resolution, but it soon began an 
oversight investigation into related subjects 
that were also the focus of a Department of 
Justice investigation by Special Counsel 
Robert S. Mueller, III. On March 4, 2019, the 
committee served document requests on the 
White House and 80 other agencies, entities, 
and individuals, ‘‘unveil[ing] an investiga-
tion . . . into the alleged obstruction of jus-
tice, public corruption, and other abuses of 
power by President Trump, his associates, 
and members of his Administration.’’ 6 Those 
document requests did not mention impeach-
ment. 
After the Special Counsel finished his in-
vestigation, the Judiciary Committee de-
manded his investigative files, describing its 
request as an exercise of legislative over-
sight authority. See Letter for William P. 
Barr, Attorney General, from Jerrold Nadler, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. 
House of Representatives at 3 (May 3, 2019) 
(asserting that ‘‘[t]he Committee has ample 
jurisdiction under House Rule X(l) to con-
duct oversight of the Department [of Jus-
tice], undertake necessary investigations, 
and consider legislation regarding the fed-
eral obstruction of justice statutes, cam-
paign-related crimes, and special counsel in-
vestigations, among other things’’). The 
committee’s subsequent letters and public 
statements likewise described its inquiry as 
serving a ‘‘legislative purpose.’’ E.g., Letter 
for Pat Cipollone, White House Counsel, from 
Jerrold Nadler, Chairman, Committee on the 
Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives at 
3–6 (May 16, 2019) (describing the ‘‘legislative 
purpose of the Committee’s investigation’’ 
(capitalization altered)). 
Over time, the Judiciary Committee ex-
panded the description of its investigation to 
claim that it was considering impeachment. 
The committee first mentioned impeach-
ment in a May 8, 2019 report recommending 
that the Attorney General be held in con-
tempt of Congress. In a section entitled ‘‘Au-
thority and Legislative Purpose,’’ the com-
mittee stated that one purpose of the inquiry 
was to determine ‘‘whether to approve arti-
cles of impeachment with respect to the 
President or any other Administration offi-
cial.’’ H.R. Rep. No. 116–105, at 12, 13 (2019).7 
The committee formally claimed to be in-
vestigating impeachment when it petitioned 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia to release grand-jury information re-
lated to the Special Counsel’s investigation. 
See Application at 1–2, In re Application of the 
Comm. on the Judiciary, U.S. House of Reps., 
No. 19–gj–48 (D.D.C. July 26, 2019); see also 
Memorandum for Members of the Committee 
on the Judiciary from Jerrold Nadler, Chair-
man, Re: Lessons from the Mueller Report, Part 
III: ‘‘Constitutional Processes for Addressing 
Presidential Misconduct’’ at 3 (July 11, 2019) 
(advising that the Committee would seek 
documents and testimony ‘‘to determine 
whether the Committee should recommend 
articles of impeachment against the Presi-
dent or any other Article I remedies, and if 
so, in what form’’).8 The committee advanced 
the same contention when asking the dis-
trict court to compel testimony before the 
committee by former White House Counsel 
Donald McGahn. See Compl. for Declaratory 
and Injunctive Relief 1, Comm. on the Judici-
ary, U.S. House of Reps. v. McGahn, No. 19–cv– 
2379 (D.D.C. Aug. 7, 2019) (contending that 
the Judiciary Committee was ‘‘now deter-
mining whether to recommend articles of 
impeachment against the President based on 
the obstructive conduct described by the 
Special Counsel’’). 
In connection with this litigation, Chair-
man Nadler described the committee as con-
ducting ‘‘formal impeachment proceedings.’’

(chronicling 
the 
evolution 
in 
Chairman 
Nadler’s descriptions of the investigation). 
Those assertions coincided with media re-
ports that Chairman Nadler had privately 
asked Speaker Pelosi to support the opening 
of an impeachment inquiry. See, e.g., Andrew 
Desiderio, Nadler: ‘This is Formal Impeachment

pushed Speaker Nancy Pelosi to support a 
formal inquiry of whether to remove the 
president from office’’). On September 12, the 
Judiciary Committee approved a resolution 
describing its investigation as an impeach-
ment inquiry and adopting certain proce-
dures for the investigation. See Resolution

Speaker Pelosi did not endorse the Judici-
ary Committee’s characterization of its in-
vestigation during the summer of 2019. But 
she later purported to announce a formal im-
peachment inquiry in connection with a sep-
arate matter arising out of a complaint filed 
with the Inspector General of the Intel-
ligence Community. The complaint, cast in 
the form of an unsigned letter to the con-
gressional intelligence committees, alleged 
that, in a July 25, 2019 telephone call, the 
President sought to pressure Ukrainian 
President Volodymyr Zelensky to inves-
tigate the prior activities of one of the Presi-
dent’s potential political rivals. See Letter 
for Richard Burr, Chairman, Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, and 
Adam Schiff, Chairman, Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, U.S. House of 
Representatives at 2–3 (Aug. 12, 2019). After 
the Inspector General reported the existence 
of the complaint to the intelligence commit-
tees, the President declassified the official 
record of the July 25 telephone call and the 
complaint, and they were publicly released 
on September 25 and 26, respectively. 
On September 24, the day before the re-
lease of the call record, Speaker Pelosi 
‘‘announc[ed]’’ that ‘‘the House of Represent-
atives is moving forward with an official im-
peachment 
inquiry’’ 
and 
that 
she 
was 
‘‘direct[ing] . . . six [c]ommittees to proceed 
with their investigations under that um-
brella of impeachment inquiry.’’ Pelosi Press 
Release, supra note 1. In an October 8, 2019 
court hearing, the House’s General Counsel 
invoked the Speaker’s announcement as pur-
portedly conclusive proof that the House had 
opened an impeachment inquiry. Tr. of Mot. 
Hrg. at 23, In re Application of the Comm. on 
the Judiciary (‘‘We are in an impeachment in-
quiry, an impeachment investigation, a for-
mal impeachment investigation because the 
House says it is. The speaker of the House 
has specifically said that it is.’’). 
On September 27, Chairman Engel of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee issued a sub-
poena 
to 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Pompeo 
‘‘[p]ursuant to the House of Representatives’ 
impeachment inquiry.’’ Three Chairmen’s 
Letter, supra note 2, at 1. That subpoena was 
the first to rely on the newly proclaimed 
‘‘impeachment inquiry.’’ A number of sub-
poenas followed, each of which was accom-
panied by a letter signed by the chairmen of 
three committees (Foreign Affairs, Oversight 
and Reform, and the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence (‘‘HPSCI’’)). Although 
the September 27 letter mentioned only the 
‘‘impeachment inquiry’’ as a basis for the ac-
companying subpoena, subsequent letters 
claimed that other subpoenas were issued 
both ‘‘[p]ursuant to the House of Representa-
tives’ impeachment inquiry’’ and ‘‘in exer-
cise of’’ the committees’ ‘‘oversight and leg-
islative jurisdiction.’’ 9 
Following service of these subpoenas, you 
and other officials within the Executive 
Branch requested our advice with respect to 
the obligations of the subpoenas’ recipients. 
We advised that the subpoenas were invalid 
because, among other reasons, the commit-
tees lacked the authority to conduct the pur-
ported inquiry and, with respect to several 
testimonial 
subpoenas, 
the 
committees 
impermissibly sought to exclude agency 
counsel from scheduled depositions. In reli-
ance upon that advice, you and other respon-
sible officials directed employees within 
their respective departments and agencies 
not to provide the documents and testimony 
requested under those subpoenas. 
On October 8, 2019, you sent a letter to 
Speaker Pelosi and the three chairmen ad-
vising them that their purported impeach-
ment inquiry was ‘‘constitutionally invalid’’ 
because the House had not authorized it.10 
The House Minority Leader, Kevin McCar-
thy, and the Ranking Member of the Judici-
ary Committee, Doug Collins, had already 
made the same objection.11 Senator Lindsey 
Graham introduced a resolution in the Sen-
ate, co-sponsored by 49 other Senators, 
which objected to the House’s impeachment

process because it had not been authorized 
by the full House and did not provide the 
President with the procedural protections 
enjoyed in past impeachment inquiries. S. 
Res. 378, 116th Cong. (2019). 
On October 25, 2019, the U.S. District Court 
for the District of Columbia granted the Ju-
diciary Committee’s request for grand-jury 
information from the Special Counsel’s in-
vestigation, holding that the committee was 
conducting an impeachment inquiry that 
was ‘‘preliminar[y] to . . . a judicial pro-
ceeding,’’ for purposes of the exception to 
grand-jury secrecy in Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. See In 
re Application of the Comm. on the Judiciary, 
U.S. House of Reps., No. 19–gj–48, 2019 WL 
5485221 (D.D.C. Oct. 25, 2019), stay granted, No. 
19–5288 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 29, 2019), argued (D.C. 
Cir. Jan. 3, 2020). In so holding, the court 
concluded that the House need not adopt a 
resolution before a committee may begin an 
impeachment inquiry. Id. at *26–28. As we 
discuss below, the district court’s analysis of 
this point relied on a misreading of the his-
torical record. 
Faced with continuing objections from the 
Administration and members of Congress to 
the validity of the impeachment-related sub-
poenas, the House decided to take a formal 
vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry. 
See Letter for Democratic Members of the 
House from Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the 
House (Oct. 28, 2019). On October 31, the 
House adopted a resolution ‘‘direct[ing]’’ sev-
eral committees ‘‘to continue their ongoing 
investigations as part of the existing House 
of Representatives inquiry into whether suf-
ficient grounds exist for the House of Rep-
resentatives to exercise its Constitutional 
power to impeach Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States of America.’’ 
Resolution 660, § 1. The resolution also adopt-
ed special procedures for impeachment pro-
ceedings before HPSCI and the Judiciary 
Committee. 
II. 
The Constitution vests in the House of 
Representatives a share of Congress’s legisla-
tive power and, separately, ‘‘the sole Power 
of Impeachment.’’ U.S. Const. art. I, § 1; id. 
art. I, § 2, cl. 5. Both the legislative power 
and the impeachment power include an im-
plied authority to investigate, including by 
means of compulsory process. But those in-
vestigative powers are not interchangeable. 
The House has broadly delegated to commit-
tees its power to investigate for legislative 
purposes, but it has held impeachment au-
thority more closely, granting authority to 
conduct particular impeachment investiga-
tions only as the need has arisen. The House 
has followed that approach from the very 
first impeachment inquiry through dozens 
more that have followed over the past 200 
years, including every inquiry involving a 
President. 
In so doing, the House has recognized the 
fundamental difference between a legislative 
oversight investigation and an impeachment 
investigation. The House does more than 
simply pick a label when it ‘‘debate[s] and 
decide[s] when it wishes to shift from legis-
lating to impeaching’’ and to authorize a 
committee to take responsibility for ‘‘the 
grave and weighty process of impeachment.’’ 
Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, 940 F.3d 710, 737, 
738 (D.C. Cir. 2019), cert. granted, No. 19–715 
(Dec. 13, 2019); see also id. at 757 (Rao, J., dis-
senting) (recognizing that ‘‘the Constitution 
forces the House to take accountability for 
its actions when investigating the Presi-
dent’s misconduct’’). Because a legislative 
investigation seeks ‘‘information respecting 
the conditions which the legislation is in-
tended to affect or change,’’ McGrain v. 
Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 175 (1927), ‘‘legisla-
tive judgments normally depend more on the 
predicted consequences of proposed legisla-
tive actions and their political acceptability, 
than on precise reconstruction of past 
events,’’ Senate Select Comm. on Presidential 
Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725, 732 
(D.C. Cir. 1974) (en banc). By contrast, an im-
peachment inquiry must evaluate whether a 
civil officer did, or did not, commit treason, 
bribery, or another high crime or mis-
demeanor, U.S. Const. art. II, § 4, and it is 
more likely than a legislative oversight in-
vestigation to call for the reconstruction of 
past events. 
Thus, the House has traditionally marked 
the shift to an impeachment inquiry by 
adopting a resolution that authorizes a com-
mittee to investigate through court-like pro-
cedures differing significantly from those 
used in routine oversight. See, e.g., Jefferson’s 
Manual § 606, at 324 (recognizing that, in 
modern practice, ‘‘the sentiment of commit-
tees has been in favor of permitting the ac-
cused to explain, present witnesses, cross-ex-
amine, and be represented by counsel’’ (cita-
tions omitted)); see also Cong. Research 
Serv., R45983, Congressional Access to Informa-
tion in an Impeachment Investigation 15 (Oct. 
25, 2019) (‘‘[D]uring both the Nixon and Clin-
ton impeachment investigations, the House 
Judiciary Committee adopted resolutions af-
fording the President and his counsel the 
right to respond to evidence gathered by the 
committee, raise objections to testimony, 
and cross-examine witnesses[.]’’).12 A House 
resolution authorizing the opening of an im-
peachment inquiry plays a highly significant 
role in directing the scope and nature of the 
constitutional inquest that follows. 
Such a resolution does not just reflect tra-
ditional practice. It is a constitutionally re-
quired step before a committee may exercise 
compulsory process in aid of the House’s 
‘‘sole Power of Impeachment.’’ U.S. Const. 
art. I, § 2, cl. 5. In this Part, we explain the 
basis for this conclusion. First, we address 
the constitutional distinction between the 
House’s power to investigate for legislative 
purposes and for impeachment purposes. We 
next explain why an impeachment inquiry 
must be authorized by the House itself. Fi-
nally, we review the historical record, which 
confirms, across dozens of examples, that the 
House must specifically authorize commit-
tees to conduct impeachment investigations 
and to issue compulsory process. 
A. 
The Constitution vests several different 
powers in the House of Representatives. As 
one half of Congress, the House shares with 
the Senate the ‘‘legislative Powers’’ granted 
in the Constitution (U.S. Const. art. I, § 1), 
which include the ability to pass bills (id. 
art. I, § 7, cl. 2) and to override presidential 
vetoes (id. art. I, § 7, cl. 3) in the process of 
enacting laws pursuant to Congress’s enu-
merated legislative powers (e.g., id. art. I, 
§ 8), including the power to appropriate fed-
eral funds (id. art. I, § 9, cl. 7). But the House 
has other, non-legislative powers. It is, for 
instance, ‘‘the Judge of the Elections, Re-
turns and Qualifications of its own Mem-
bers.’’ Id. art. I, § 5, cl. 1. And it has ‘‘the sole 
Power of Impeachment.’’ Id. art. I, § 2, cl. 5. 
The House and Senate do not act in a legis-
lative role in connection with impeachment. 
The Constitution vests the House with the 
authority to accuse civil officers of ‘‘Trea-
son, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’ that warrant removal and dis-
qualification from office. U.S. Const. art. I, 
§ 2, cl. 5; id. art. I, § 3, cl. 7; id. art. II, § 4. As 
Alexander Hamilton explained, the members 
of the House act as ‘‘the inquisitors for the 
nation.’’ The Federalist No. 65, at 440 (Jacob 
E. Cooke ed., 1961). And Senators, in turn, 
act ‘‘in their judicial character as a court for 
the trial of impeachments.’’ Id. at 439; see 
also The Federalist No. 66, at 445–46 (defending 
the ‘‘partial intermixture’’ in the impeach-
ment context of usually separated powers as 
‘‘not only proper, but necessary to the mu-
tual defense of the several members of the 
government, against each other’’; noting 
that dividing ‘‘the right of accusing’’ from 
‘‘the right of judging’’ between ‘‘the two 
branches of the legislature . . . avoids the in-
convenience of making the same persons 
both accusers and judges’’). The House’s im-
peachment authority differs fundamentally 
in character from its legislative power. 
With respect to both its legislative and its 
impeachment powers, the House has cor-
responding powers of investigation, which 
enable it to collect the information nec-
essary for the exercise of those powers. The 
Supreme Court has explained that ‘‘[t]he 
power of inquiry—with process to enforce 
it—is an essential and appropriate auxiliary 
to the legislative function.’’ McGrain, 273 
U.S. at 174. Thus, in the legislative context, 
the House’s investigative power ‘‘encom-
passes inquiries concerning the administra-
tion of existing laws as well as proposed or 
possibly needed statutes.’’ Watkins v. United 
States, 354 U.S. 178, 187 (1957); see also Scope of 
Congressional 
Oversight 
and 
Investigative 
Power with Respect to the Executive Branch, 9 
Op. O.L.C. 60, 60 (1985) (‘‘Congress may con-
duct investigations in order to obtain facts 
pertinent to possible legislation and in order 
to evaluate the effectiveness of current 
laws.’’). The Court has further recognized 
that the House also has implied powers to in-
vestigate in support of its other powers, in-
cluding its power of impeachment. See, e.g., 
Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 190 (1880); 
see also In re Request for Access to Grand Jury 
Materials, 833 F.2d 1438, 1445 (11th Cir. 1987) 
(the House ‘‘holds investigative powers that 
are ancillary to its impeachment power’’); 
Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 749 (Rao, J., dis-
senting) (‘‘The House . . . has a separate 
power 
to 
investigate 
pursuant 
to 
impeachment[.]’’). 
Because the House has different investiga-
tive powers, establishing which authority 
has been delegated has often been necessary 
in the course of determining the scope of a 
committee’s authority to compel witnesses 
and testimony. In addressing the scope of the 
House’s 
investigative 
powers, 
all 
three 
branches of the federal government have rec-
ognized the constitutional distinction be-
tween a legislative investigation and an im-
peachment inquiry. 
1. 
We begin with the federal courts. In 
Kilbourn, the Supreme Court held that a 
House committee could not investigate a 
bankrupt company indebted to the United 
States because its request exceeded the 
scope of the legislative power. According to 
the Court, the committee had employed in-
vestigative power to promote the United 
States’ interests as a creditor, rather than 
for any valid legislative purpose. See 103 U.S. 
at 192–95. At the same time, the Court con-
ceded that ‘‘the whole aspect of the case 
would have been changed’’ if ‘‘any purpose 
had 
been 
avowed 
to 
impeach 
the 
[S]ecretary’’ of the Navy for mishandling the 
debts of the United States. Id. at 193. But, 
after reviewing the resolution authorizing 
the actions of the committee, the Court con-
firmed that the House had not authorized 
any impeachment inquiry. Id. 
In a similar vein, the D.C. Circuit distin-
guished the needs of the House Judiciary 
Committee, which was conducting an im-
peachment inquiry into the actions of Presi-
dent Nixon, from those of the Senate Select 
Committee on Presidential Campaign Activi-
ties, whose investigation was premised upon

legislative oversight. See Senate Select Comm., 
498 F.2d at 732. The court recognized that the 
impeachment investigation was rooted in 
‘‘an express constitutional source’’ and that 
the House committee’s investigative needs 
differed in kind from the Senate committee’s 
oversight needs. Id. In finding that the Sen-
ate committee had not demonstrated that 
President Nixon’s audiotapes were ‘‘critical 
to the performance of its legislative func-
tions,’’ the court recognized ‘‘a clear dif-
ference between Congress’s legislative tasks 
and the responsibility of a grand jury, or any 
institution engaged in like functions,’’ such as 
the House Judiciary Committee, which had 
‘‘begun an inquiry into presidential impeach-
ment.’’ Id. (emphases added). 
More recently, the D.C. Circuit acknowl-
edged this same distinction in Mazars USA. 
As the majority opinion explained, ‘‘the Con-
stitution has left to Congress the judgment 
whether to commence the impeachment 
process’’ and to decide whether the conduct 
in question is ‘‘better addressed through 
oversight and legislation than impeach-
ment.’’ 940 F.3d at 739. Judge Rao’s dissent 
also recognized the distinction between a 
legislative oversight investigation and an 
impeachment inquiry. See id. at 757 (‘‘The 
Framers established a mechanism for Con-
gress to hold even the highest officials ac-
countable, but also required the House to 
take 
responsibility 
for 
invoking 
this 
power.’’). Judge Rao disagreed with the ma-
jority insofar as she understood Congress’s 
impeachment power to be the sole means for 
investigating past misconduct by impeach-
able officers. But both the majority and the 
dissent agreed with the fundamental propo-
sition that the Constitution distinguishes 
between 
investigations 
pursuant 
to 
the 
House’s impeachment authority and those 
that serve its legislative authority (includ-
ing oversight). 
2. 
The Executive Branch similarly has long 
distinguished between investigations for leg-
islative and for impeachment purposes. In 
1796, the House ‘‘[r]esolved’’ that President 
Washington ‘‘be requested to lay before th[e] 
House a copy of the instructions’’ given to 
John Jay in preparation for his negotiation 
of a peace settlement with Great Britain. 5 
Annals of Cong. 759–62 (1796). Washington re-
fused to comply because the Constitution 
contemplates that only the Senate, not the 
House, must consent to a treaty. See id. at 
760–61. ‘‘It d[id] not occur’’ to Washington 
‘‘that the inspection of the papers asked for, 
c[ould] be relative to any purpose under the 
cognizance of the House of Representatives, 
except that of an impeachment.’’ Id. at 760 (em-
phasis added). Because the House’s ‘‘resolu-
tion ha[d] not expressed’’ any purpose of pur-
suing impeachment, Washington concluded 
that ‘‘a just regard to the constitution . . . 
forb[ade] a compliance with [the House’s] re-
quest’’ for documents. Id. at 760, 762. 
In 1832, President Jackson drew the same 
line. A select committee of the House had re-
quested 
that 
the 
Secretary 
of 
War 
‘‘furnish[]’’ it ‘‘with a copy’’ of an unratified 
1830 treaty with the Chickasaw Tribe and 
‘‘the journal of the commissioners’’ who ne-
gotiated it. H.R. Rep. No. 22–488, at 1 (1832). 
The Secretary conferred with Jackson, who 
refused to comply with the committee’s re-
quest on the same ground cited by President 
Washington: he ‘‘d[id] not perceive that a 
copy of any part of the incomplete and un-
ratified treaty of 1830, c[ould] be relative to 
any purpose under the cognizance of the 
House of Representatives, except that of an 
impeachment, which the resolution has not 
expressed.’ ’’ Id. at 14 (reprinting Letter for 
Charles A. Wickliffe, Chairman, Committee 
on Public Lands, U.S. House of Representa-
tives, from Lewis Cass, Secretary of War 
(Mar. 2, 1832)). 
In 1846, another House select committee re-
quested that President Polk account for dip-
lomatic expenditures made in previous ad-
ministrations by Secretary of State Daniel 
Webster. Polk refused to disclose informa-
tion but ‘‘cheerfully admitted’’ that the 
House may have been entitled to such infor-
mation if it had ‘‘institute[d] an [impeach-
ment] inquiry into the matter.’’ Cong. Globe, 
29th Cong., 1st Sess. 698 (1846).13 Notably, he 
took this position even though some mem-
bers of Congress had suggested that evidence 
about the expenditures could support an im-
peachment of Webster.14 In these and other 
instances, the Executive Branch has consist-
ently drawn a distinction between the power 
of legislative oversight and the power of im-
peachment. See Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 761– 
64 (Rao, J., dissenting) (discussing examples 
from the Buchanan, Grant, Cleveland, Theo-
dore Roosevelt, and Coolidge Administra-
tions). 
3. 
House members, too, have consistently rec-
ognized the difference between a legislative 
oversight investigation and an impeachment 
investigation. See Alissa M. Dolan et al., 
Cong. Research Serv., RL30240, Congressional 
Oversight Manual 25 (Dec. 19, 2014) (‘‘A com-
mittee’s inquiry must have a legislative pur-
pose or be conducted pursuant to some other 
constitutional power of Congress, such as the 
authority .
.
. to .
.
. conduct impeach-
ment proceedings.’’ (emphases added)); Cong. 
Research Serv., Congressional Access to Infor-
mation in an Impeachment Investigation at 1 
(distinguishing 
between 
‘‘legislative 
investigation[s]’’ and ‘‘[m]uch more rare[]’’ 
‘‘impeachment investigation[s]’’). 
For instance, in 1793, when debating the 
House’s jurisdiction to investigate Secretary 
of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, some 
members argued that the House could not 
adopt a resolution of investigation into 
Hamilton’s conduct without adopting the 
‘‘solemnities and guards’’ of an impeachment 
inquiry. See, e.g., 3 Annals of Cong. 903 (1793) 
(statement of Rep. Smith); id. at 947–48 
(statement of Rep. Boudinot) (distinguishing 
between the House’s ‘‘Legislative capacity’’ 
and its role as ‘‘the grand inquest of the Na-
tion’’); see also Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 758 
(Rao, J., dissenting) (discussing the episode). 
In 1796, when the House debated whether to 
request the President’s instructions for ne-
gotiating the Jay Treaty, Representative 
Murray concluded that the House could not 
meddle in treatymaking, but acknowledged 
that ‘‘the subject would be presented under 
an aspect very different’’ if the resolution’s 
supporters had ‘‘stated the object for which 
they called for the papers to be an impeach-
ment.’’ 5 Annals of Cong. 429–30 (1796). 
Similarly, in 1846, a House select com-
mittee agreed with President Polk’s decision 
not to turn over requested information re-
garding 
State 
Department 
expenditures 
where the House did not act ‘‘with a view to 
an impeachment.’’ H.R. Rep. No. 29–684, at 4 
(1846) (noting that four of the committee’s 
five members ‘‘entirely concur with the 
President of the United States’’ in deciding 
not to ‘‘communicate or make [the requested 
documents] public, except with a view to an 
impeachment’’ and that ‘‘[n]o dissent from 
the views of that message was expressed by 
the House’’); see also Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 
761 (Rao, J., dissenting). To take another ex-
ample, in 1879, the House Judiciary Com-
mittee distinguished ‘‘[i]nvestigations look-
ing to the impeachment of public officers’’ 
from ‘‘an ordinary investigation for legisla-
tive purposes.’’ H.R. Rep. No. 45–141, at 2 
(1879). 
Most significantly, during the impeach-
ments of Presidents Nixon and Clinton, the 
House Judiciary Committee determined that 
the House must provide express authoriza-
tion before any committee may exercise 
compulsory powers in an impeachment in-
vestigation. See infra Part II.C.1. Thus, mem-
bers of the House, like the other branches of 
government, have squarely recognized the 
distinction between congressional investiga-
tions for impeachment purposes and those 
for legislative purposes. 
B. 
Although the House of Representatives has 
‘‘the sole Power of Impeachment,’’ U.S. 
Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 5 (emphasis added), the 
associated power to conduct an investigation 
for impeachment purposes may, like the 
House’s other investigative powers, be dele-
gated. The full House may make such a dele-
gation by adopting a resolution in exercise of 
its authority to determine the rules for its 
proceedings, see id. art. I, § 5, cl. 2, and each 
House has broad discretion in determining 
the conduct of its own proceedings. See, e.g., 
NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513, 551–52 
(2014); United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 
(1892); see also 1 Deschler’s Precedents ch. 5, § 4, 
at 305–06. But the House must actually exer-
cise its discretion by making that judgment 
in the first instance, and its resolution sets 
the terms of a committee’s authority. See 
United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 44 (1953). 
No committee may exercise the House’s in-
vestigative powers in the absence of such a 
delegation. 
As the Supreme Court has explained in the 
context of legislative oversight, ‘‘[t]he the-
ory of a committee inquiry is that the com-
mittee members are serving as the rep-
resentatives of the parent assembly in col-
lecting information for a legislative pur-
pose’’ and, in such circumstances, commit-
tees ‘‘are endowed with the full power of the 
Congress to compel testimony.’’ Watkins, 354 
U.S. at 200–01. The same is true for impeach-
ment investigations.15 Thus, Hamilton recog-
nized, the impeachment power involves a 
trust of such ‘‘delicacy and magnitude’’ that 
it ‘‘deeply concerns the political reputation 
and existence of every man engaged in the 
administration of public affairs.’’ The Fed-
eralist No. 65, at 440. The Founders foresaw 
that an impeachment effort would ‘‘[i]n 
many cases . . . connect itself with the pre- 
existing factions’’ and ‘‘inlist all their ani-
mosities, partialities, influence and interest 
on one side, or on the other.’’ Id. at 439. As 
a result, they placed the solemn authority to 
initiate an impeachment in ‘‘the representa-
tives of the nation themselves.’’ Id. at 440. In 
order to entrust one of its committees to in-
vestigate for purposes of impeachment, the 
full House must ‘‘spell out that group’s juris-
diction and purpose.’’ Watkins, 354 U.S. at 
201. Otherwise, a House committee con-
trolled by such a faction could launch open- 
ended and untethered investigations without 
the sanction of a majority of the House. 
Because a committee may exercise the 
House’s investigative powers only when au-
thorized, the committee’s actions must be 
within the scope of a resolution delegating 
authority from the House to the committee. 
As the D.C. Circuit recently explained, ‘‘it 
matters not whether the Constitution would 
give Congress authority to issue a subpoena 
if Congress has given the issuing committee 
no such authority.’’ Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 
722; see Dolan, Congressional Oversight Manual 
at 24 (‘‘Committees of Congress only have 
the power to inquire into matters within the 
scope of the authority delegated to them by 
their parent body.’’). In evaluating a com-
mittee’s authority, the House’s resolution 
‘‘is the controlling charter of the commit-
tee’s powers,’’ and, therefore, the commit-
tee’s ‘‘right to exact testimony and to call 
for the production of documents must be

found in this language.’’ Rumely, 345 U.S. at 
44; see also Watkins, 354 U.S. at 201 (‘‘Those 
instructions are embodied in the authorizing 
resolution. That document is the commit-
tee’s charter.’’); id. at 206 (‘‘Plainly [the 
House’s] committees are restricted to the 
missions delegated to them . . . . No witness 
can be compelled to make disclosures on 
matters outside that area.’’); Exxon Corp. v. 
FTC, 589 F.2d 582, 592 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (‘‘To 
issue a valid subpoena, . . . a committee or 
subcommittee must conform strictly to the 
resolution 
establishing 
its 
investigatory 
powers[.]’’); United States v. Lamont, 18 F.R.D. 
27, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 1955) (Weinfeld, J.) (‘‘No com-
mittee of either the House or Senate, and no 
Senator and no Representative, is free on its 
or his own to conduct investigations unless 
authorized. Thus it must appear that Con-
gress empowered the Committee to act, and 
further that at the time the witness alleg-
edly defied its authority the Committee was 
acting within the power granted to it.’’). 
While a committee may study some matters 
without exercising the investigative powers 
of the House, a committee’s authority to 
compel the production of documents and tes-
timony depends entirely upon the jurisdic-
tion provided by the terms of the House’s 
delegation. 
In Watkins, the Supreme Court relied upon 
those principles to set aside a conviction for 
contempt of Congress because of the author-
izing resolution’s vagueness. The uncertain 
scope 
of 
the 
House’s 
delegation 
impermissibly created ‘‘a wide gulf between 
the responsibility for the use of investigative 
power and the actual exercise of that 
power.’’ 354 U.S. at 205. If the House wished 
to authorize the exercise of its investigative 
power, then it needed to take responsibility 
for the use of that power, because a congres-
sional subpoena, issued with the threat of a 
criminal 
contempt 
citation, 
necessarily 
placed ‘‘constitutional liberties’’ in ‘‘dan-
ger.’’ Id. 
The concerns expressed by the Court in 
Watkins apply with equal, if not greater, 
force when considering the authority of a 
House committee to compel the production 
of documents in connection with inves-
tigating impeachment. As John Labovitz, a 
House impeachment attorney during the 
Nixon 
investigation, 
explained: 
‘‘[I]mpeachment 
investigations, 
because 
they involve extraordinary power and (at 
least where the president is being inves-
tigated) 
may 
have 
extraordinary 
con-
sequences, are not to be undertaken in the 
same manner as run-of-the-mill legislative 
investigations. The initiation of a presi-
dential impeachment inquiry should itself 
require a deliberate decision by the House.’’ 
John R. Labovitz, Presidential Impeachment 
184 (1978). Because a committee possesses 
only the authorities that have been dele-
gated to it, a committee may not use com-
pulsory process to investigate impeachment 
without the formal authorization of the 
House. 
C. 
Historical 
practice 
confirms 
that 
the 
House must authorize an impeachment in-
quiry. See, e.g., Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 
2076, 2091 (2015) (recognizing that ‘‘[i]n sepa-
ration-of-powers cases,’’ the Court has placed 
‘‘significant weight’’ on ‘‘accepted under-
standings and practice’’); Noel Canning, 573 
U.S. at 514 (same). The House has expressly 
authorized every impeachment investigation 
of a President, including by identifying the 
investigative committee and authorizing the 
use of compulsory process. The same thing 
has been true for nearly all impeachment in-
vestigations of other executive officials and 
judges. While committees have sometimes 
studied a proposed impeachment resolution 
or reviewed available information without 
conducting a formal investigation, in nearly 
every case in which the committee resorted 
to compulsory process, the House expressly 
authorized the impeachment investigation. 
That practice was foreseen as early as 1796. 
When Washington asked his Cabinet for opin-
ions about how to respond to the House’s re-
quest for the papers associated with the Jay 
Treaty, the Secretary of the Treasury, Oliver 
Wolcott Jr., explained that ‘‘the House of 
Representatives has no right to demand pa-
pers’’ 
outside 
its 
legislative 
function 
‘‘[e]xcept when an Impeachment is proposed 
& a formal enquiry instituted.’’ Letter for 
George Washington from Oliver Wolcott Jr. 
(Mar. 26, 1796), reprinted in 19 The Papers of 
George Washington: Presidential Series 611–12 
(David R. Hoth ed., 2016) (emphasis added). 
From the very first impeachment, the 
House has recognized that a committee 
would require a delegation to conduct an im-
peachment inquiry. In 1797, when House 
members considered whether a letter con-
tained evidence of criminal misconduct by 
Senator William Blount, they sought to con-
firm Blount’s handwriting but concluded 
that the Committee of the Whole did not 
have the power of taking evidence. See 7 An-
nals of Cong. 456–58 (1797); 3 Asher C. Hinds, 
Hinds’ Precedents of the House of Representa-
tives of the United States § 2294, at 644–45 (1907). 
Thus, the committee ‘‘rose,’’ and the House 
itself took testimony. 3 Hinds’ Precedents 
§ 2294, at 646. Two days later, the House ap-
pointed a select committee to ‘‘prepare and 
report articles of impeachment’’ and vested 
in that committee the ‘‘power to send for 
persons, papers, and records.’’ 7 Annals of 
Cong. at 463–64, 466; 3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2297, 
at 648.16 As we discuss in this section, we 
have identified dozens of other instances 
where the House, in addition to referring 
proposed articles of impeachment, author-
ized formal impeachment investigations. 
Against this weighty historical record, 
which involves nearly 100 authorized im-
peachment investigations, the outliers are 
few and far between.17 In 1879, it appears that 
a House committee, which was expressly au-
thorized to conduct an oversight investiga-
tion into the administration of the U.S. con-
sulate in Shanghai, ultimately investigated 
and recommended that the former consul- 
general and former vice consul-general be 
impeached. In addition, between 1986 and 
1989, the Judiciary Committee considered the 
impeachment of three federal judges who had 
been criminally prosecuted (two of whom 
had been convicted). The Judiciary Com-
mittee pursued impeachment before there 
had been any House vote, and issued sub-
poenas in two of those inquiries. Since then, 
however, 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
re-
affirmed during the impeachment of Presi-
dent Clinton that, in order to conduct an im-
peachment investigation, it needed an ex-
press delegation of investigative authority 
from the House. And in all subsequent cases 
the House has hewed to the well-established 
practice of authorizing each impeachment 
investigation. 
The U.S. District Court for the District of 
Columbia recently reviewed a handful of his-
torical examples and concluded that House 
committees may conduct impeachment in-
vestigations without a vote of the full House. 
See In re Application of the Comm. on the Judi-
ciary, 2019 WL 5485221, at *26–28. Yet, as the 
discussion below confirms, the district court 
misread the lessons of history.18 The district 
court treated the House Judiciary Commit-
tee’s preliminary inquiries in the Clinton 
and Nixon impeachments as investigations, 
without recognizing that, in both cases, the 
committee determined that a full House vote 
was necessary before it could issue sub-
poenas. The district court also treated the 
1980s judicial inquiries as if they represented 
a rule of practice, rather than a marked de-
viation from the dozens of occasions where 
the House recognized the need to adopt a for-
mal resolution to delegate its investigative 
authority. As our survey below confirms, the 
historical practice with respect to Presi-
dents, other executive officers, and judges is 
consistent with the structure of our Con-
stitution, which requires the House, as the 
‘‘sole’’ holder of impeachment power, to au-
thorize any impeachment investigation that 
a committee may conduct on its behalf. 
1. 
While many Presidents have been the sub-
ject of less-formal demands for impeach-
ment, at least eleven have faced resolutions 
introduced in the House for the purpose of 
initiating impeachment proceedings.19
In 
some cases, the House formally voted to re-
ject opening a presidential impeachment in-
vestigation. In 1843, the House rejected a res-
olution calling for an investigation into the 
impeachment of President Tyler. See Cong. 
Globe, 27th Cong., 3d Sess. 144–46 (1843). In 
1932, the House voted by a wide margin to 
table a similar resolution introduced against 
President Hoover. See 76 Cong. Rec. 399–402 
(1932). In many other cases, the House simply 
referred impeachment resolutions to the Ju-
diciary Committee, which took no further 
action before the end of the Congress. But, in 
three instances before President Trump, the 
House moved forward with investigating the 
impeachment of a President.20 Each of those 
presidential impeachments advanced to the 
investigative stage only after the House 
adopted a resolution expressly authorizing a 
committee to conduct the investigation. In 
no case did the committee use compulsory 
process until the House had expressly au-
thorized the impeachment investigation. 
The impeachment investigation of President 
Andrew Johnson. On January 7, 1867, the 
House adopted a resolution authorizing the 
‘‘Committee on the Judiciary’’ to ‘‘inquire 
into the official conduct of Andrew Johnson 
. . . and to report to this House whether, in 
their opinion,’’ the President ‘‘has been 
guilty of any act, or has conspired with oth-
ers to do acts, which, in contemplation of 
the Constitution, are high crimes or mis-
demeanors.’’ Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 2d 
Sess. 320–21 (1867); see also 3 Hinds’ Precedents 
§ 2400, at 824. The resolution conferred upon 
the committee the ‘‘power to send for per-
sons and papers and to administer the cus-
tomary oath to witnesses.’’ Cong. Globe, 39th 
Cong., 2d Sess. 320 (1867). The House referred 
a second resolution to the Judiciary Com-
mittee on February 4, 1867. Id. at 991; 3 Hinds’ 
Precedents § 2400, at 824.21 Shortly before that 
Congress expired, the committee reported 
that it had seen ‘‘sufficient testimony . . . to 
justify and demand a further prosecution of 
the investigation.’’ H.R. Rep. No. 39–31, at 2 
(1867). On March 7, 1867, the House in the new 
Congress adopted a resolution that author-
ized the committee ‘‘to continue the inves-
tigation authorized’’ in the January 7 resolu-
tion and to ‘‘send for persons and papers’’ 
and administer oaths. Cong. Globe, 40th 
Cong., 1st Sess. 18, 25 (1867); 3 Hinds’ Prece-
dents § 2401, at 825–26. The committee rec-
ommended articles of impeachment, but the 
House rejected those articles on December 7, 
1867. See Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess. 67– 
68 (1867). In early 1868, however, the House 
adopted resolutions authorizing another in-
vestigation, with compulsory powers, by the 
Committee on Reconstruction and trans-
ferred to that committee the evidence from 
the Judiciary Committee’s earlier investiga-
tion. See Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess. 
784–85, 1087 (1868); 3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2408, at 
845. 
On February 21, 1868, the impeachment ef-
fort received new impetus when Johnson re-
moved the Secretary of War without the

Senate’s approval, contrary to the terms of 
the Tenure of Office Act, which Johnson 
(correctly) held to be an unconstitutional 
limit on his authority. See Cong. Globe, 40th 
Cong., 2d Sess. 1326–27 (1868); 3 Hinds’ Prece-
dents § 2408–09, at 845–47; see also Myers v. 
United States, 272 U.S. 52, 176 (1926) (finding 
that provision of the Tenure of Office Act 
‘‘was invalid’’). That day, the Committee on 
Reconstruction reported an impeachment 
resolution to the House, which was debated 
on February 22 and passed on February 24.

The impeachment investigation of President 
Nixon. Although many resolutions were in-
troduced in support of President Nixon’s im-
peachment earlier in 1973, the House’s formal 
impeachment inquiry arose in the months 
following the ‘‘Saturday Night Massacre,’’ 
during which President Nixon caused the ter-
mination of Special Prosecutor Archibald 
Cox at the cost of the resignations of his At-
torney General and Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral. See Letter Directing the Acting Attor-
ney General to Discharge the Director of the 
Office of Watergate Special Prosecution 
Force (Oct. 20, 1973), Pub. Papers of Pres. 
Richard Nixon 891 (1973). Immediately there-
after, House members introduced resolutions 
calling either for the President’s impeach-
ment or for the opening of an investigation.22 
The Speaker of the House referred the reso-
lutions calling for an investigation to the 
Rules Committee and those calling for im-
peachment to the Judiciary Committee. See 
Office of Legal Counsel, U.S. Dep’t of Jus-
tice, Legal Aspects of Impeachment: An Over-
view at 40 (Feb. 1974) (‘‘Legal Aspects of Im-
peachment’’); 3 Deschler’s Precedents ch. 14, § 5, 
at 2020. 
Following the referrals, the Judiciary 
Committee ‘‘beg[a]n an inquiry into whether 
President Nixon ha[d] committed any of-
fenses that could lead to impeachment,’’ an 
exercise that the committee considered ‘‘pre-
liminary.’’ Richard L. Madden, Democrats 
Agree on House Inquiry into Nixon’s Acts, N.Y. 
Times, Oct. 23, 1973, at 1. The committee 
started collecting publicly available mate-
rials, and Chairman Peter Rodino Jr. stated 
that he would ‘‘set up a separate committee 
staff to ‘collate’ investigative files from Sen-
ate and House committees that have exam-
ined a variety of charges against the Nixon 
Administration.’’ James M. Naughton, Ro-
dino Vows Fair Impeachment Inquiry, N.Y. 
Times, Oct. 30, 1973, at 32. 
Although the committee ‘‘adopted a reso-
lution permitting Mr. Rodino to issue sub-
poenas without the consent of the full com-
mittee,’’ James M. Naughton, House Panel 
Starts Inquiry on Impeachment Question, N.Y. 
Times, Oct. 31, 1973, at 1, no subpoenas were 
ever issued under that purported authority. 
Instead, the committee ‘‘delayed acting’’ on 
the impeachment resolutions. James M. 
Naughton, House Unit Looks to Impeachment, 
N.Y. Times, Dec. 2, 1973, at 54. By late De-
cember, the committee had hired a special-
ized impeachment staff. A Hard-Working 
Legal Adviser: John Michael Doar, N.Y. Times, 
Dec. 21, 1973, at 20. The staff continued 
‘‘ ‘wading through the mass of material al-
ready made public,’ ’’ and the committee’s 
members began considering ‘‘the areas in 
which the inquiry should go.’’ Bill Kovach, 
Vote on Subpoena Could Test House on Im-
peachment, N.Y. Times, Jan. 8, 1974, at 14; see 
also Staff of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 
93d Cong., Rep. on Work of the Impeachment 
Inquiry Staff as of February 5, 1974, at 2–3 
(1974) (noting that the staff was ‘‘first col-
lecting and sifting the evidence available in 
the public domain,’’ then ‘‘marshaling and 
digesting the evidence available through var-
ious governmental investigations’’). By Jan-
uary 1974, the committee’s actions had con-
sisted of digesting publicly available docu-
ments and prior impeachment precedents. 
That was consistent with the committee’s 
‘‘only mandate,’’ which was to ‘‘study more 
than a dozen impeachment resolutions sub-
mitted’’ in 1973. James M. Naughton, Im-
peachment Panel Seeks House Mandate for In-
quiry, N.Y. Times, Jan. 25, 1974, at 1. 
In January, the committee determined 
that a formal investigation was necessary, 
and it requested ‘‘an official House mandate 
to conduct the inquiry,’’ relying upon the 
‘‘precedent in each of the earlier [impeach-
ment] inquiries.’’ Id. at 17. On January 7, 
Chairman Rodino ‘‘announced that the Com-
mittee’s subpoena power does not extend to 
impeachment and that . . . the Committee 
would seek express authorization to sub-
poena persons and documents with regard to 
the impeachment inquiry.’’ Legal Aspects of 
Impeachment at 43; see also Richard L. Lyons, 
GOP Picks Jenner as Counsel, Wash. Post, Jan. 
8, 1974, at A1, A6 (‘‘Rodino said the com-
mittee will ask the House when it recon-
venes Jan. 21 to give it power to subpoena 
persons and documents for the inquiry. The 
committee’s subpoena power does not now 
extend to impeachment proceedings, he 
said.’’). As the House Parliamentarian later 
explained, the Judiciary Committee’s gen-
eral authority to conduct investigations and 
issue subpoenas ‘‘did not specifically include 
impeachments within the jurisdiction of the 
Committee on the Judiciary,’’ and it was 
therefore ‘‘considered necessary for the 
House to specifically vest the Committee on 
the Judiciary with the investigatory and 
subpena power to conduct the impeachment 
investigation.’’ 3 Deschler’s Precedents ch. 14, 
§ 15.2, at 2172 (Parliamentarian’s Note). 
On February 6, 1974, the House approved 
Resolution 803, which ‘‘authorized and di-
rected’’ the Judiciary Committee ‘‘to inves-
tigate fully and completely whether suffi-
cient grounds exist for the House of Rep-
resentatives to exercise its constitutional 
power to impeach Richard M. Nixon, Presi-
dent of the United States of America.’’ H.R. 
Res. 803, 93d Cong. § 1. The resolution specifi-
cally authorized the committee ‘‘to require 
. . . by subpena or otherwise . . . the attend-
ance and testimony of any person’’ and ‘‘the 
production of such things’’ as the committee 
‘‘deem[ed] necessary’’ to its investigation. 
Id. § 2(a). 
Speaking on the House floor, Chairman Ro-
dino described the resolution as a ‘‘necessary 
step’’ to confer the House’s investigative 
powers on the Judiciary Committee: 
We have reached the point when it is im-
portant that the House explicitly confirm 
our responsibility under the Constitution. 
We are asking the House of Representa-
tives, by this resolution, to authorize and di-
rect the Committee on the Judiciary to in-
vestigate the conduct of the President of the 
United States . . . . 
As part of that resolution, we are asking 
the House to give the Judiciary Committee 
the power of subpena in its investigations. 
Such a resolution has always been passed by 
the House. . . . It is a necessary step if we are 
to meet our obligations. 
. . . . 
. . . The sole power of impeachment carries 
with it the power to conduct a full and com-
plete investigation of whether sufficient 
grounds for impeachment exist or do not 
exist, and by this resolution these investigative 
powers are conferred to their full extent upon 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
120 Cong. Rec. 2350–51 (1974) (emphases 
added). During the debate, others recognized 
that the resolution would delegate the 
House’s investigative powers to the Judici-
ary Committee. See, e.g., id. at 2361 (state-
ment of Rep. Rostenkowski) (‘‘By delegating 
to the Judiciary Committee the powers con-
tained in this resolution, we will be pro-
viding that committee with the resources it 
needs to inform the whole House of the facts 
of this case.’’); id. at 2362 (statement of Rep. 
Boland) (‘‘House Resolution 803 is intended 
to delegate to the Committee on the Judici-
ary the full extent of the powers of this 
House in an impeachment proceeding[]—both 
as to the persons and types of things that 
may be subpenaed and the methods for doing 
so.’’). Only after the Judiciary Committee 
had received authorization from the House 
did it request and subpoena tape recordings 
and documents from President Nixon. See 
H.R. Rep. No. 93–1305, at 187 (1974).23 
The impeachment investigation of President 
Clinton. On September 9, 1998, Independent 
Counsel Kenneth W. Starr, acting under 28 
U.S.C. § 595(c), advised the House of Rep-
resentatives that he had uncovered substan-
tial and credible information that he be-
lieved could constitute grounds for the im-
peachment of President Clinton. 18 Deschler’s 
Precedents app. at 548–49 (2013). Two days 
later, the House adopted a resolution that 
referred the matter, along with Starr’s re-
port and 36 boxes of evidence, to the Judici-
ary Committee. H.R. Res. 525, 105th Cong. 
(1998). The House directed that committee to 
review the report and ‘‘determine whether 
sufficient grounds exist to recommend to the 
House that an impeachment inquiry be com-
menced.’’ Id. § 1. The Rules Committee’s 
Chairman emphasized that the House would 
need to adopt a subsequent resolution if it 
decided to authorize an impeachment in-
quiry: ‘‘[T]his resolution does not authorize 
or direct an impeachment inquiry. . . . It 
merely provides the appropriate parameters 
for the Committee on the Judiciary . . . to 
. . . make a recommendation to the House as 
to whether we should commence an impeach-
ment inquiry.’’ 144 Cong. Rec. 20021 (1998) 
(statement of Rep. Solomon). 
On October 7, 1998, the Judiciary Com-
mittee did recommend that there be an in-
vestigation for purposes of impeachment. As 
explained 
in 
the 
accompanying 
report: 
‘‘[T]he Committee decided that it must receive 
authorization from the full House before pro-
ceeding on any further course of action. Be-
cause impeachment is delegated solely to the 
House of Representatives by the Constitu-
tion, the full House of Representatives 
should be involved in critical decision mak-
ing regarding various stages of impeach-
ment.’’ H.R. Rep. No. 105–795, at 24 (emphasis 
added). The committee also observed that ‘‘a 
resolution authorizing an impeachment in-
quiry into the conduct of a president is con-
sistent with past practice,’’ citing the reso-
lutions for Presidents Johnson and Nixon 
and observing that ‘‘numerous other inquir-
ies were authorized by the House directly, or 
by providing investigative authorities, such 
as deposition authority, to the Committee 
on the Judiciary.’’ Id. 
The next day, the House voted to authorize 
the Judiciary Committee to ‘‘investigate 
fully and completely whether sufficient 
grounds exist for the House of Representa-
tives to exercise its constitutional power to 
impeach William Jefferson Clinton, Presi-
dent of the United States of America.’’ H.R. 
Res. 581, 105th Cong. § 1 (1998). The resolution 
authorized the committee ‘‘to require . . . by 
subpoena or otherwise . . . the attendance 
and testimony of any person’’ and ‘‘the pro-
duction of . . . things,’’ and to require the 
furnishing of information ‘‘by interrog-
atory.’’ Id. § 2(a). ‘‘On November 5, 1998,’’ as 
part of its investigation, ‘‘the Committee 
presented President Clinton with 81 requests 
for admission,’’ which the Committee ex-
plained that it ‘‘would have . . . compelled 
by subpoena’’ had President Clinton not 
complied. H.R. Rep. No. 105–830, at 77, 122

(1998). And the Committee then ‘‘approved 
the issuance of subpoenas for depositions and 
materials’’ from several witnesses. 144 Cong. 
Rec. D1210–11 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 1998). 
In discussing the Clinton precedent, the 
district court in In re Application of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary treated the D.C. Cir-
cuit’s approval of the disclosure of Starr’s 
report and associated grand-jury information 
as evidence that the Judiciary Committee 
may ‘‘commence an impeachment investiga-
tion’’ without a House vote. 2019 WL 5485221, 
at *27 & n.36. But the D.C. Circuit did not au-
thorize that disclosure because of any pend-
ing House investigation. It did so because a 
statutory provision required an independent 
counsel to ‘‘advise the House of Representa-
tives of any substantial and credible infor-
mation which such independent counsel re-
ceives . . . that may constitute grounds for an 
impeachment.’’ 28 U.S.C. § 595(c) (emphasis 
added). And the D.C. Circuit viewed the re-
port as reflecting ‘‘information of the type 
described in 28 U.S.C. § 595(c).’’ In re Madison 
Guar. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, Div. No. 94–1 (D.C. 
Cir. Spec. Div. July 7, 1998), reprinted in H.R. 
Doc. No. 105–331, pt. 1, at 10 (1998). The order 
authorizing the transmission of that infor-
mation to the House did not imply that any 
committee was conducting an impeachment 
investigation. To the contrary, after the 
House received the information, ‘‘no person 
had access to’’ it until after the House adopt-
ed a resolution referring the matter to the 
Judiciary Committee. H.R. Rep. No. 105–795, 
at 5. And the House then adopted a second 
resolution (Resolution 581) to authorize a 
formal investigation. In other words, the 
House voted to authorize the Judiciary Com-
mittee both to review the Starr evidence and 
to conduct an impeachment investigation. 
Neither the D.C. Circuit nor the Judiciary 
Committee suggested that any committee 
could have taken such action on its own. 
2. 
The House has historically followed these 
same procedures in considering impeach-
ment resolutions against executive branch 
officers other than the President. In many 
cases, 
an 
initial 
resolution 
laying 
out 
charges of impeachment or authorizing an 
investigation was referred to a select or 
standing committee.24 Following such a re-
ferral, the designated committee reviewed 
the matter and considered whether to pursue 
a formal impeachment inquiry—it did not 
treat the referral as stand-alone authoriza-
tion to conduct an investigation. When a 
committee concluded that the charges war-
ranted investigation, it reported to the full 
House, which then considered whether to 
adopt a resolution to authorize a formal in-
vestigation. 
For example, in March 1867, the House ap-
proved a resolution directing the Committee 
on Public Expenditures ‘‘to inquire into the 
conduct of Henry A. Smythe, collector of the 
port of New York.’’ Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 
1st Sess. 132 (1867); see also id. (noting that 
the resolution had been modified following 
debate ‘‘so as to leave out that part about 
bringing articles of impeachment’’). Weeks 
later, the House voted to authorize an im-
peachment investigation. Id. at 290 (author-
izing the investigating committee to ‘‘send 
for persons and papers’’). The House followed 
this same procedure in 1916 for U.S. Attorney 
H. Snowden Marshall. H.R. Res. 90, 64th 
Cong. (1916) (initial resolution referred to the 
Judiciary Committee); H.R. Res. 110, 64th 
Cong. (1916) (resolution approving the inves-
tigation contemplated in the initial resolu-
tion). And the process repeated in 1922 for 
Attorney General Harry Daugherty. H.R. 
Res. 425, 67th Cong. (1922) (referring the ini-
tial resolution to the committee); H.R. Res. 
461, 67th Cong. (1922) (resolution approving 
the investigation contemplated in the initial 
resolution). 
In a few instances, the House asked com-
mittees to draft articles of impeachment 
without calling for any additional impeach-
ment investigation. For example, in 1876, 
after uncovering ‘‘unquestioned evidence of 
the malfeasance in office by General William 
W. Belknap’’ (who was then Secretary of 
War) in the course of another investigation, 
the House approved a resolution charging 
the Committee on the Judiciary with the re-
sponsibility to ‘‘prepare and report without 
unnecessary delay suitable articles of im-
peachment.’’ 4 Cong. Rec. 1426, 1433 (1876). 
When a key witness left the country, how-
ever, the committee determined that addi-
tional investigation was warranted, and it 
asked to be authorized ‘‘to take further 
proof’’ and ‘‘to send for persons and papers’’ 
in its search for alternative evidence. Id. at 
1564, 1566; see also 3 Hinds’ Precedents §§ 2444– 
45, at 902–04. 
In. some cases, the House declined to au-
thorize a committee to investigate impeach-
ment with the aid of compulsory process. In 
1873, the House authorized the Judiciary 
Committee ‘‘to inquire whether anything’’ in 
testimony presented to a different com-
mittee implicating Vice President Schuyler 
Colfax ‘‘warrants articles of impeachment of 
any officer of the United States not a mem-
ber of this House, or makes it proper that 
further investigation should be ordered in 
his case.’’ Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 3d Sess. 
1545 (1873); see 3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2510, at 
1016–17. No further investigation was author-
ized. A similar sequence occurred in 1917 in 
the case of an impeachment resolution of-
fered against members of the Federal Re-
serve Board. See 54 Cong. Rec. 3126–30 (1917) 
(impeachment resolution); H.R. Rep. No. 64– 
1628, at 1 (1917) (noting that following the re-
ferral of the impeachment resolution, the 
Committee had reviewed available informa-
tion and determined that no further pro-
ceedings were warranted). In 1932, the House 
referred to the Judiciary Committee a reso-
lution calling for the investigation of the 
possible impeachment of Secretary of the 
Treasury Andrew Mellon. H.R. Res. 92, 72d 
Cong. (1932); see also 3 Deschler’s Precedents 
ch. 14, § 14.1, at 2134–39. The following month, 
the 
House 
approved 
a 
resolution 
dis-
continuing any investigation of the charges. 
75 Cong. Rec. 3850 (1932); see also 3 Deschler’s 
Precedents ch. 14, § 14.2, at 2139–40. 
Most recently, in the 114th Congress, the 
House referred to the Judiciary Committee 
resolutions concerning the impeachment of 
the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue 
Service, John Koskinen. See H.R. Res. 494, 
114th Cong. (2015); H.R. Res. 828, 114th Cong. 
(2016). Shortly after an attempt to force a 
floor 
vote 
on 
one 
of 
the 
resolutions, 
Koskinen voluntarily appeared before the 
committee at a hearing. See Impeachment Ar-
ticles Referred on John Koskinen (Part III): 
Hearing Before the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 
114th Cong. 2 (2016). The ranking minority 
member, Representative John Conyers, ob-
served that, despite the title, ‘‘this is not an 
impeachment hearing’’ because, ‘‘[a]ccording 
to parliamentarians of the House past and 
present, the impeachment process does not 
begin until the House actually votes to au-
thorize this Committee to investigate the 
charges.’’ Id. at 3; see also id. at 30 (similar 
statement by Rep. Johnson). During the 
hearing, Commissioner Koskinen offered to 
provide a list of supporting witnesses who 
could be cross-examined ‘‘if the Committee 
decided it wanted to go to a full-scale im-
peachment process, which I understand this 
is not.’’ Id. at 45. Two months later, one of 
the impeachment resolutions was briefly ad-
dressed on the floor of the House, and again 
referred to the Judiciary Committee, but 
without providing any investigative author-
ity. See 162 Cong. Rec. H7251–54 (daily ed. 
Dec. 6, 2016). The committee never sought to 
compel the appearance of Koskinen or any 
other witness, and the committee does not 
appear to have taken any further action be-
fore the Congress expired. 
In his 1978 book on presidential impeach-
ment, former House impeachment attorney 
John Labovitz observed that there were a 
‘‘few exceptions,’’ ‘‘mostly in the 1860s and 
1870s,’’ to the general rule that ‘‘past im-
peachment investigations ha[ve] been au-
thorized by a specific resolution conferring 
subpoena power.’’ Labovitz, Presidential Im-
peachment at 182 & n.18. In our review of the 
history, we have identified one case from 
that era where a House committee com-
menced a legislative oversight investigation 
and subsequently moved, without separate 
authorization, to consider impeachment.25 
But the overwhelming historical practice to 
the contrary confirms the Judiciary Com-
mittee’s well-considered conclusions in 1974 
and 1998 that a committee requires specific 
authorization from the House before it may 
use compulsory process to investigate for 
impeachment purposes. 
3. 
The House has followed the same practice 
in connection with nearly all impeachment 
investigations involving federal judges. Com-
mittees sometimes studied initial referrals, 
but they waited for authorization from the 
full House before conducting any formal im-
peachment investigation. Three cases from 
the late 1980s departed from that pattern, 
but the House has returned during the past 
three decades to the historical baseline, re-
peatedly ensuring that the Judiciary Com-
mittee had a proper delegation for each im-
peachment investigation. 
The practice of having the House authorize 
each specific impeachment inquiry is re-
flected in the earliest impeachment inves-
tigations involving judges. In 1804, the House 
considered proposals to impeach two judges: 
Samuel Chase, an associate justice of the Su-
preme Court, and Richard Peters, a district 
judge. See 3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2342, at 711–16. 
There was a ‘‘lengthy debate’’ about whether 
the evidence was appropriate to warrant the 
institution of an inquiry. Id. at 712. The 
House then adopted a resolution appointing 
a select committee ‘‘to inquire into the offi-
cial conduct’’ of Chase and Peters ‘‘and to re-
port’’ the committee’s ‘‘opinion whether’’ ei-
ther of the judges had ‘‘so acted, in their ju-
dicial capacity, as to require the interposi-
tion of the constitutional power of this 
House.’’ 13 Annals of Cong. 850, 875–76 (1804); 
3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2342, at 715. A few days 
later, another resolution ‘‘authorized’’ the 
committee ‘‘to send for persons, papers, and 
records.’’ 13 Annals of Cong. at 877; see also 3 
Hinds’ Precedents § 2342, at 715. At the conclu-
sion of its investigation, the committee rec-
ommended that Chase, but not Peters, be im-
peached. 3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2343, at 716. The 
House thereafter agreed to a resolution im-
peaching Chase. Id. at 717. Congress recessed 
before the Senate could act, but, during the 
next Congress, the House appointed an al-
most identical select committee, which was 
‘‘given no power of investigation.’’ Id. §§ 2343 
0944, at 717–18. The committee recommended 
revised articles of impeachment against 
Chase, which were again adopted by the 
House. Id. § 2344, at 718–19. In 1808, the House 
again separately authorized an investigation 
when it considered whether Peter Bruin, a 
Mississippi territorial judge, should be im-
peached for ‘‘neglect of duty and drunken-
ness on the bench.’’ Id. § 2487, at 983–84. A 
member of the House objected ‘‘that it would 
hardly be dignified for the Congress to pro-
ceed to an impeachment’’ based on the terri-
torial legislature’s referral and proposed the

appointment of a committee ‘‘to inquire into 
the propriety of impeaching.’’ Id. at 984; see 
18 Annals of Cong. 2069 (1808). The House then 
passed a resolution forming a committee to 
conduct an inquiry, which included the 
‘‘power to send for persons, papers, and 
records’’ but, like most inquiries to follow, 
did not result in impeachment. 18 Annals of 
Cong. at 2189; 3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2487, at 984. 
Over the course of more than two centuries 
thereafter, members of the House introduced 
resolutions to impeach, or to investigate for 
potential impeachment, dozens more federal 
judges, and the House continued, virtually 
without exception, to provide an express au-
thorization before any committee proceeded 
to exercise investigative powers.26 In one 1874 
case, the Judiciary Committee realized only 
after witnesses had traveled from Arkansas 
that it could not find any resolution grant-
ing it compulsory powers to investigate pre-
viously referred charges against Judge Wil-
liam Story. See 2 Cong. Rec. 1825, 3438 (1874); 
3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2513, at 1023. In order to 
‘‘cure’’ that ‘‘defect,’’ the committee re-
ported a privileged resolution to the floor of 
the House that would grant the committee 
‘‘power to send for persons and papers’’ as 
part of the impeachment investigation. 2 
Cong. Rec. at 3438. The House promptly 
agreed to the resolution, enabling the com-
mittee to ‘‘examine’’ the witnesses that day. 
Id. 
In other cases, however, no full investiga-
tion ever materialized. In 1803, John Pick-
ering, a district judge, was impeached, but 
the House voted to impeach him without 
conducting any investigation at all, relying 
instead upon documents supplied by Presi-
dent Jefferson. See 3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2319, 
at 681–82; see also Lynn W. Turner, The Im-
peachment of John Pickering, 54 Am. Hist. 
Rev. 485, 491 (1949). Sometimes, the House au-
thorized only a preliminary inquiry to deter-
mine whether an investigation would be war-
ranted. In 1908, for instance, the House asked 
the Judiciary Committee to consider pro-
posed articles impeaching Judge Lebbeus 
Wilfley of the U.S. Court for China. In the 
ensuing hearing, the Representative who had 
introduced the resolution acknowledged that 
the committee was not ‘‘authorized to sub-
poena witnesses’’ and had been authorized to 
conduct only ‘‘a preliminary examination,’’ 
which was ‘‘not like an investigation ordi-
narily held by the House,’’ but was instead 
dedicated solely to determining ‘‘whether 
you believe it is a case that ought to be in-
vestigated at all.’’ 27 In many other cases, it 
is apparent that—even when impeachment 
resolutions had been referred to them—com-
mittees conducted no formal investigation.28 
In 1970, in a rhetorical departure from well- 
established practice, a subcommittee of the 
Judiciary Committee described itself as in-
vestigating the impeachment of Justice Wil-
liam O. Douglas based solely upon an im-
peachment resolution referred to the Judici-
ary Committee. See 116 Cong. Rec. 11920, 11942 
(1970); 3 Deschler’s Precedents ch. 14, §§ 14.14– 
14.16, at 2151–64; see also Labovitz, Presidential 
Impeachment at 182 n.18 (noting that ‘‘[t]he 
Douglas inquiry was the first impeachment 
investigation in twenty-five years, and devi-
ation from the older procedural pattern was 
not surprising’’). Yet, the subcommittee did 
not resort to any compulsory process during 
its inquiry, and it did not recommend im-
peachment. 3 Deschler’s Precedents ch. 14, 
§§ 14.15–14.16, at 2158–63. Accordingly, the 
committee did not actually exercise any of 
the investigative powers of the House. 
In the late 1980s, the House Judiciary Com-
mittee considered the impeachment of three 
district-court judges without any express au-
thorization from the House: Walter Nixon, 
Alcee Hastings, and Harry Claiborne. See In 
re Application of the Comm. on the Judiciary, 
2019 WL 5485221, at *26 (discussing these in-
vestigations). All three judges had been 
criminally prosecuted, and two had been con-
victed. See H.R. Rep. No. 101–36, at 12–13 
(1989) (describing Nixon’s prosecution and 
conviction); H.R. Rep. No. 100–810, at 7–8, 29– 
31, 38–39 (1988) (describing Hastings’s indict-
ment and trial and the subsequent decision 
to proceed with a judicial-misconduct pro-
ceeding in lieu of another prosecution); H.R. 
Rep. No. 99–688, at 9, 17–20 (1986) (describing 
Claiborne’s prosecution and conviction). In 
the Claiborne inquiry, the committee does 
not appear to have issued any subpoenas. See 
H.R. Rep. No. 99–688, at 4 (noting that the 
committee sent ‘‘[i]nvitational letters to all 
witnesses,’’ who apparently cooperated to 
the Committee’s satisfaction). The com-
mittee did issue subpoenas in the Nixon and 
Hastings investigations, yet no witness ap-
pears to have objected on the ground that 
the committee lacked jurisdiction to issue 
the subpoenas, and at least one witness ap-
pears to have requested a subpoena.29
In 
those two cases, though, the Judiciary Com-
mittee 
effectively 
compelled 
production 
without any express authorization from the 
House.30 
In the years after these outliers, the Judi-
ciary Committee returned to the practice of 
seeking specific authorization from the 
House before conducting impeachment inves-
tigations. Most notably, as discussed above, 
the Judiciary Committee ‘‘decided that it 
must receive authorization from the full House 
before proceeding’’ with an impeachment in-
vestigation of President Clinton. H.R. Rep. 
No. 105–795, at 24 (emphasis added). And the 
House has used the same practice with re-
spect to federal judges.31 Thus, in 2008, the 
House adopted a resolution authorizing the 
Judiciary Committee to investigate the im-
peachment of Judge G. Thomas Porteous, 
Jr., including the grant of subpoena author-
ity. See H.R. Rep. No. 111–427, at 7 (2010); H.R. 
Res. 1448, 110th Cong. (2008); 154 Cong. Rec. 
19502 (2008). After the Congress expired, the 
House in the next Congress adopted a new 
resolution re-authorizing the inquiry, again 
with subpoena authority. See H.R. Res. 15, 
111th Cong. (2009); 155 Cong. Rec. 568, 571 
(2009). Several months later, another district 
judge, Samuel Kent, pleaded guilty to ob-
struction of justice and was sentenced to 35 
months of incarceration. See H.R. Rep. 111– 
159, at 9–13 (2009). The House then adopted a 
resolution directing the Judiciary Com-
mittee to investigate impeachment, again 
specifically granting subpoena authority. See 
id. at 13; H.R. Res. 424, 111th Cong. (2009); 155 
Cong. Rec. at 12211–13. 
Thus, the House’s long-standing and nearly 
unvarying practice with respect to judicial 
impeachment inquiries is consistent with the 
conclusion that the power to investigate in 
support of the House’s ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment,’’ U.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 5, may 
not be exercised by a committee without an 
express delegation from the House. In the 
cases of Judges Nixon and Hastings, the Ju-
diciary Committee did exercise compulsory 
authority despite the absence of any delega-
tion from the House. But insofar as no party 
challenged the committee’s authority at the 
time, and no court addressed the matter, 
these historical outliers do not undermine 
the broader constitutional principle. As the 
Supreme Court observed in Noel Canning, 
‘‘when considered against 200 years of settled 
practice,’’ a ‘‘few scattered examples’’ are 
rightly regarded ‘‘as anomalies.’’ 573 U.S. at 
538. They do not call into question the sound-
ness of the House’s otherwise consistent his-
torical practice, much less the constitu-
tional requirement that a committee exer-
cise the constitutional powers of the House 
only with an express delegation from the 
House itself. 
III. 
Having concluded that a House committee 
may not conduct an impeachment investiga-
tion without a delegation of authority, we 
next consider whether the House provided 
such a delegation to the Foreign Affairs 
Committee or to the other committees that 
issued subpoenas pursuant to the asserted 
impeachment inquiry. During the five weeks 
between the Speaker’s announcement on 
September 24 and the adoption of Resolution 
660 on October 31, the committees issued nu-
merous impeachment-related subpoenas. See 
supra note 9. We therefore provided advice 
during that period about whether any of the 
committees had authority to issue those sub-
poenas. Because the House had not adopted 
an impeachment resolution, the answer to 
that question turned on whether the com-
mittees could issue those subpoenas based 
upon any preexisting subpoena authority. 
In justifying the subpoenas, the Foreign 
Affairs Committee and other committees 
pointed to the resolution adopting the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, which es-
tablish the committees and authorize inves-
tigations for matters within their jurisdic-
tion. The committees claimed that Rule XI 
confers authority to issue subpoenas in con-
nection with an impeachment investigation. 
Although the House has expanded its com-
mittees’ authority in recent decades, the 
House Rules continue to reflect the long-es-
tablished distinction between legislative and 
non-legislative investigative powers. Those 
rules confer legislative oversight jurisdiction 
on committees and authorize the issuance of 
subpoenas to that end, but they do not grant 
authority to investigate for impeachment 
purposes. While the House committees could 
have sought some information relating to 
the same subjects in the exercise of their 
legislative oversight authority, the sub-
poenas they purported to issue ‘‘pursuant to 
the House of Representatives’ impeachment 
inquiry’’ were not in support of such over-
sight. We therefore conclude that they were 
unauthorized. 
A. 
The standing committees of the House 
trace their general subpoena powers back to 
the House Rules, which the 116th Congress 
adopted by formal resolution. See H.R. Res. 6, 
116th Cong. (2019). The House Rules are more 
than 60,000 words long, but they do not in-
clude the word ‘‘impeachment.’’ The Rules’ 
silence on that topic is particularly notable 
when contrasted with the Senate, which has 
adopted specific ‘‘Rules of Procedure and 
Practice’’ for impeachment trials. S. Res. 
479, 99th Cong. (1986).32 The most obvious 
conclusion to draw from that silence is that 
the current House, like its predecessors, re-
tained impeachment authority at the level 
of the full House, subject to potential delega-
tions in resolutions tailored for that pur-
pose. 
Rule XI of the Rules of the House affirma-
tively authorizes committees to issue sub-
poenas, but only for matters within their 
legislative jurisdiction. The provision has 
been a part of the House Rules since 1975. See 
H.R. Res. 988, 93d Cong. § 301 (1974). Clause 
2(m)(1) of Rule XI vests each committee with 
the authority to issue subpoenas ‘‘[f]or the 
purpose of carrying out any of its functions 
and duties under this rule and rule X (includ-
ing any matters referred to it under clause 2 
of rule XII).’’ Rule XI, cl. 2(m)(1); see also 
Rule X, cl. 11(d)(1) (making clause 2 of Rule 
XI applicable to HPSCI). The committees 
therefore have subpoena power to carry out 
their authorities under three rules: Rule X, 
Rule XI, and clause 2 of Rule XII. 
Rule X does not provide any committee 
with jurisdiction over impeachment. Rule X 
establishes the ‘‘standing committees’’ of

the House and vests them with ‘‘their legis-
lative jurisdictions.’’ Rule X, cl. 1. The juris-
diction of each committee varies in subject 
matter and scope. While the Committee on 
Ethics, for example, has jurisdiction over 
only ‘‘[t]he Code of Official Conduct’’ (Rule 
X, cl. 1(g)), the jurisdiction of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee spans seventeen subjects, 
including ‘‘[r]elations of the United States 
with 
foreign 
nations 
generally,’’ 
‘‘[i]ntervention abroad and declarations of 
war,’’ and ‘‘[t]he American National Red 
Cross’’ (Rule X, cl. 1(i)(1), (9), (15)). The rule 
likewise spells out the jurisdiction of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform (Rule 
X, cl. 1(n), cl. 3(i)), and the jurisdiction of the 
Judiciary Committee (Rule X, cl. 1(l)). 
Clause 11 of Rule X establishes HPSCI and 
vests it with jurisdiction over ‘‘[t]he Central 
Intelligence Agency, the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, and the National Intel-
ligence Program’’ and over ‘‘[i]ntelligence 
and intelligence-related activities of all 
other departments and agencies.’’ Rule X, cl. 
11(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)–(B). 
The text of Rule X confirms that it ad-
dresses the legislative jurisdiction of the 
standing committees. After defining each 
standing committee’s subject-matter juris-
diction, the Rule provides that ‘‘[t]he var-
ious standing committees shall have general 
oversight responsibilities’’ to assist the 
House in its analysis of ‘‘the application, ad-
ministration, execution, and effectiveness of 
Federal laws’’ and of the ‘‘conditions and cir-
cumstances that may indicate the necessity 
or desirability of enacting new or additional 
legislation,’’ as well as to assist the House in 
its ‘‘formulation, consideration, and enact-
ment of changes in Federal laws, and of such 
additional legislation as may be necessary or 
appropriate.’’ Rule X, cl. 2(a)(1)–(2). The com-
mittees are to conduct oversight ‘‘on a con-
tinuing basis’’ ‘‘to determine whether laws 
and programs addressing subjects within the 
jurisdiction of a committee’’ are imple-
mented as Congress intends ‘‘and whether 
they should be continued, curtailed, or 
eliminated.’’ Rule X, cl. 2(b)(1). Those are all 
functions traditionally associated with legis-
lative oversight, not the separate power of 
impeachment. See supra Part II.A. Clause 3 of 
Rule X further articulates ‘‘[s]pecial over-
sight functions’’ with respect to particular 
subjects for certain committees; for exam-
ple, the Committee on Foreign Affairs ‘‘shall 
review and study on a continuing basis laws, 
programs, and Government activities relat-
ing to .
.
. intelligence activities relating 
to foreign policy,’’ Rule X, cl. 3(f). And 
clause 4 addresses ‘‘[a]dditional functions of 
committees,’’ including functions related to 
the review of appropriations and the special 
authorities of the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform, Rule X, cl. 4(a)(1), (c)(1). But 
none 
of 
the 
‘‘[s]pecial 
oversight’’ 
or 
‘‘[a]dditional’’ functions specified in clauses 
3 and 4 includes any reference to the House’s 
impeachment power. 
The powers of HPSCI are addressed in 
clause 11 of Rule X. Unlike the standing 
committees, HPSCI is not given ‘‘[g]eneral 
oversight responsibilities’’ in clause 2. But 
clause 3 gives it the ‘‘[s]pecial oversight 
functions’’ of ‘‘review[ing] and study[ing] on 
a continuing basis laws, programs, and ac-
tivities of the intelligence community’’ and 
of ‘‘review[ing] and study[ing] .
.
. the 
sources and methods of’’ specified entities 
that engage in intelligence activities. Rule 
X, cl. 3(m). And clause 11 further provides 
that proposed legislation about intelligence 
activities will be referred to HPSCI and that 
HPSCI shall report to the House ‘‘on the na-
ture and extent of the intelligence and intel-
ligence-related activities of the various de-
partments 
and 
agencies 
of 
the 
United 
States.’’ Rule X, cl. 11(b)(1), (c)(1); see also 
H.R. Res. 658, 95th Cong. § 1 (1977) (resolution 
establishing HPSCI, explaining its purpose 
as ‘‘provid[ing] vigilant legislative oversight 
over the intelligence and intelligence-related 
activities of the United States’’ (emphasis 
added)). Again, those powers sound in legis-
lative oversight, and nothing in the Rules 
suggests that HPSCI has any generic delega-
tion of the separate power of impeachment. 
Consistent with the foregoing textual anal-
ysis, Rule X has been seen as conferring leg-
islative oversight authority on the House’s 
committees, without any suggestion that 
impeachment authorities are somehow in-
cluded therein. The Congressional Research 
Service describes Rule X as ‘‘contain[ing] 
the legislative and oversight jurisdiction of 
each standing committee, several clauses on 
committee procedures and operations, and a 
clause specifically addressing the jurisdic-
tion and operation of the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence.’’ Michael L. 
Koempel & Judy Schneider, Cong. Research 
Serv., R41605, House Standing Committees’ 
Rules on Legislative Activities: Analysis of 
Rules in Effect in the 114th Congress 2 (Oct. 11, 
2016); see also Dolan, Congressional Oversight 
Manual at 25 (distinguishing a committee in-
quiry with ‘‘a legislative purpose’’ from in-
quiries conducted under ‘‘some other con-
stitutional power of Congress, such as the 
authority’’ to ‘‘conduct impeachment pro-
ceedings’’). In the chapter of Deschler’s Prece-
dents 
devoted 
to 
explaining 
the 
‘‘[i]nvestigations and [i]nquiries’’ by the 
House and its committees, the Parliamen-
tarian repeatedly notes that impeachment 
investigations and other non-legislative pow-
ers are discussed elsewhere. See 4 Deschler’s 
Precedents ch. 15, § 1, at 2283; id. § 14, at 2385 
n.12; id. § 16, at 2403 & n.4. 
Rule X concerns only legislative oversight, 
and Rule XI does not expand the committees’ 
subpoena authority any further. That rule 
rests upon the jurisdiction granted in Rule 
X. See Rule XI, cl. 1(b)(1) (‘‘Each committee 
may conduct at any time such investigations 
and studies as it considers necessary or ap-
propriate in the exercise of its responsibil-
ities under rule X.’’). Nor does Rule XII con-
fer any additional jurisdiction. Clause 2(a) 
states that ‘‘[t]he Speaker shall refer each 
bill, resolution, or other matter that relates 
to a subject listed under a standing com-
mittee named in clause 1 of rule X[.]’’ Rule 
XII, cl. 2(a). The Speaker’s referral authority 
under Rule XII is thus limited to matters 
within a committee’s Rule X legislative ju-
risdiction. See 18 Deschler’s Precedents app. at 
578 (‘‘All committees were empowered by ac-
tual language of the Speaker’s referral to 
consider only ‘such provisions of the meas-
ure as fall within their respective jurisdic-
tions under Rule X.’’’). Accordingly, the 
Speaker may not expand the jurisdiction of a 
committee by referring a bill or resolution 
falling outside the committee’s Rule X au-
thority.33 
In reporting Resolution 660 to the House, 
the Rules Committee expressed the view that 
clause 2(m) of Rule XI gave standing com-
mittees the authority to issue subpoenas in 
support of impeachment inquiries. See H.R. 
Rep. No. 116–266, at 18 (2019). But the com-
mittee did not explain which terms of the 
rule provide such authority. To the contrary, 
the committee simply asserted that the rule 
granted such authority and that the text of 
Resolution 660 departed from its predecessors 
on account of amendments to clause 2(m) 
that were adopted after the ‘‘Clinton and 
Nixon impeachment inquiry resolutions.’’ Id. 
Yet clause 2(m) of Rule XI was adopted two 
decades before the Clinton inquiry.34 Even 
with that authority in place, the Judiciary 
Committee recognized in 1998 that it ‘‘must 
receive authorization from the full House be-
fore proceeding’’ to investigate President 
Clinton for impeachment purposes. H.R. Rep. 
No. 105–795, at 24 (emphasis added). And, even 
before Rule XI was adopted, the House had 
conferred on the Judiciary Committee a ma-
terially similar form of investigative author-
ity (including subpoena power) in 1973.35 The 
Judiciary Committee nevertheless recog-
nized that those subpoena powers did not au-
thorize it to conduct an impeachment in-
quiry about President Nixon. In other words, 
the Rules Committee’s recent interpretation 
of clause 2(m) (which it did not explain in its 
report) cannot be reconciled with the Judici-
ary Committee’s well-reasoned conclusion, 
in both 1974 and 1998, that Rule XI (and its 
materially similar predecessor) do not confer 
any standing authority to conduct an im-
peachment investigation. 
In modern practice, the Speaker has re-
ferred proposed resolutions calling for the 
impeachment of a civil officer to the Judici-
ary Committee. See Jefferson’s Manual § 605, 
at 324. Consistent with this practice, the 
Speaker referred the Sherman resolution 
(H.R. Res. 13, 116th Cong.) to the Judiciary 
Committee, because it called for the im-
peachment of President Trump. Yet the re-
ferral itself did not grant authority to con-
duct an impeachment investigation. House 
committees have regularly received referrals 
and conducted preliminary inquiries, with-
out compulsory process, for the purpose of 
determining whether to recommend that the 
House open a formal impeachment investiga-
tion. See supra Part II.C. Should a committee 
determine that a formal inquiry is war-
ranted, then the committee recommends 
that the House adopt a resolution that au-
thorizes such an investigation, confers sub-
poena power, and provides special process to 
the target of the investigation. The Judici-
ary Committee followed precisely that pro-
cedure in connection with the impeachment 
investigations of Presidents Nixon and Clin-
ton, among many others. By referring an im-
peachment resolution to the House Judiciary 
Committee, the Speaker did not expand that 
committee’s subpoena authority to cover a 
formal impeachment investigation. In any 
event, no impeachment resolution was ever 
referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
HPSCI, or the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform. Rule XII thus could not provide any 
authority to those committees in support of 
the impeachment-related subpoenas issued 
before October 31. 
Accordingly, when those subpoenas were 
issued, the House Rules did not provide au-
thority to any of those committees to issue 
subpoenas in connection with potential im-
peachment. In reaching this conclusion, we 
do not question the broad authority of the 
House of Representatives to determine how 
and when to conduct its business. See U.S. 
Const. art. I, § 5, cl. 2. As the Supreme Court 
has recognized, ‘‘‘all matters of method are 
open to the determination’’’ of the House, 
‘‘as long as there is ‘a reasonable relation be-
tween the mode or method of proceeding es-
tablished by the rule and the result which is 
sought to be attained,’ and the rule does not 
‘ignore constitutional restraints or violate 
fundamental rights.’’’ Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 
at 551 (quoting United States v. Ballin, 144 
U.S. 1, 5 (1892)). The question, however, is not 
‘‘what rules Congress may establish for its 
own governance,’’ but ‘‘rather what rules the 
House has established and whether they have 
been followed.’’ Christoffel v. United States, 
338 U.S. 84, 88–89 (1949); see also Yellin v. 
United States, 374 U.S. 109, 121 (1963) (stating 
that a litigant ‘‘is at least entitled to have 
the Committee follow its rules and give him 
consideration according to the standards it 
has adopted in’’ the relevant rule); United 
States v. Smith, 286 U.S. 6, 33 (1932) (‘‘As the 
construction to be given to the rules affects 
persons other than members of the Senate,

the question presented is of necessity a judi-
cial one.’’). Statements by the Speaker or by 
committee chairmen are not statements of 
the House itself. Cf. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. at 
552–53 (relying on statements and actions of 
the Senate itself, as reflected in the Journal 
of the Senate and the Congressional Record, 
to determine when the Senate was ‘‘in ses-
sion’’). Our conclusion here turned upon 
nothing more, and nothing less, than the 
rules and resolutions that had been adopted 
by a majority vote of the full House.36 
The text of those provisions determined 
whether the House had delegated the nec-
essary authority. See id. at 552 (‘‘[O]ur def-
erence to the Senate cannot be absolute. 
When the Senate is without the capacity to 
act, under its own rules, it is not in session 
even if it so declares.’’). Thus, the Supreme 
Court has repeatedly made clear that a tar-
get of the House’s compulsory process may 
question whether a House resolution has ac-
tually conferred the necessary powers upon a 
committee, because the committee’s ‘‘right 
to exact testimony and to call for the pro-
duction of documents must be found in [the 
resolution’s] language.’’ Rumely, 345 U.S. at 
44; see also Watkins, 354 U.S. at 201. In Rumely, 
the Court expressly rejected the argument 
that the House had confirmed the commit-
tee’s jurisdiction by adopting a resolution 
that merely held the witness in contempt 
after the fact. As the Court explained, what 
was said ‘‘after the controversy had arisen 
regarding the scope of the resolution .
.
. 
had the usual infirmity of post litem motam, 
self-serving declarations.’’ 345 U.S. at 48. In 
other words, even a vote of the full House 
could not ‘‘enlarge[]’’ a committee’s author-
ity after the fact for purposes of finding that 
a witness had failed to comply with the obli-
gations imposed by the subpoena. Id. 
Here, the House committees claiming to 
investigate impeachment issued subpoenas 
before they had received any actual delega-
tion of impeachment-related authority from 
the House. Before October 31, the commit-
tees relied solely upon statements of the 
Speaker, the committee chairmen, and the 
Judiciary Committee, all of which merely 
asserted that one or more House committees 
had already been conducting a formal im-
peachment inquiry. There was, however, no 
House resolution actually delegating such 
authority to any committee, let alone one 
that did so with ‘‘sufficient particularity’’ to 
compel witnesses to respond. Watkins, 354 
U.S. at 201; cf. Gojack v. United States, 384 
U.S. 702, 716–17 (1966). At the opening of this 
Congress, the House had not chosen to confer 
investigative authority over impeachment 
upon any committee, and therefore, no 
House committee had authority to compel 
the production of documents or testimony in 
furtherance of an impeachment inquiry that 
it was not authorized to conduct. 
B. 
Lacking a delegation from the House, the 
committees could not compel the production 
of documents or the testimony of witnesses 
for purposes of an impeachment inquiry. Be-
cause the first impeachment-related sub-
poena the September 27 subpoena from the 
Foreign Affairs Committee—rested entirely 
upon the purported impeachment inquiry, see 
Three Chairmen’s Letter, supra note 2, at 1, 
it was not enforceable. See, e.g., Rumely, 345 
U.S. at 44. Perhaps recognizing this infir-
mity, the committee chairmen invoked not 
merely the impeachment inquiry in connec-
tion with subsequent impeachment-related 
subpoenas but also the committees’ ‘‘over-
sight and legislative jurisdiction.’’ See supra 
note 9 and accompanying text. That asser-
tion of dual authorities presented the ques-
tion whether the committees could leverage 
their oversight jurisdiction to require the 
production of documents and testimony that 
the committees avowedly intended to use for 
an unauthorized impeachment inquiry. We 
advised that, under the circumstances of 
these subpoenas, the committees could not 
do so. 
Any congressional inquiry ‘‘must be re-
lated to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate 
task of the Congress.’’ Watkins, 354 U.S. at 
187. The Executive Branch need not presume 
that such a purpose exists or accept a 
‘‘makeweight’’ assertion of legislative juris-
diction. Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 725–26, 727; 
see also Shelton v. United States, 404 F.2d 1292, 
1297 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (‘‘In deciding whether the 
purpose is within the legislative function, 
the mere assertion of a need to consider ‘re-
medial legislation’ may not alone justify an 
investigation accompanied with compulsory 
process[.]’’). Indeed, ‘‘an assertion from a 
committee chairman may not prevent the 
Executive from confirming the legitimacy of 
an investigative request.’’ Congressional Com-
mittee’s Request for the President’s Tax Returns 
Under 26 U.S.C. § 6103(f), 43 Op. O.L.C. _, at *20 
(June 13, 2019). To the contrary, ‘‘a threshold 
inquiry that should be made upon receipt of 
any congressional request for information is 
whether the request is supported by any le-
gitimate legislative purpose.’’ Response to 
Congressional Requests for Information Regard-
ing Decisions Made Under the Independent 
Counsel Act, 10 Op. O.L.C. 68, 74 (1986); see also 
Congressional Requests for Confidential Execu-
tive Branch Information, 13 Op. O.L.C. 153, 159 
(1989) (recognizing that the constitutionally 
mandated accommodation process ‘‘requires 
that each branch explain to the other why it 
believes its needs to be legitimate’’). 
Here, the committee chairmen made clear 
upon issuing the subpoenas that the commit-
tees were interested in the requested mate-
rials to support an investigation into the po-
tential impeachment of the President, not to 
uncover information necessary for potential 
legislation within their respective areas of 
legislative jurisdiction. In marked contrast 
with routine oversight, each of the sub-
poenas was accompanied by a letter signed 
by the chairs of three different committees, 
who transmitted a subpoena ‘‘[p]ursuant to 
the House of Representatives’ impeachment 
inquiry’’ and recited that the documents 
would ‘‘be collected as part of the House’s 
impeachment inquiry,’’ and that they would 
be ‘‘shared among the Committees, as well as 
with the Committee on the Judiciary as ap-
propriate.’’ See supra note 9 and accom-
panying text. Apart from their token invoca-
tions of ‘‘oversight and legislative jurisdic-
tion,’’ the letters offered no hint of any leg-
islative purpose. The committee chairmen 
were therefore seeking to do precisely what 
they said—compel the production of infor-
mation to further an impeachment inquiry. 
In reaching this conclusion, we do not fore-
close the possibility that the Foreign Affairs 
Committee or the other committees could 
have issued similar subpoenas in the bona 
fide exercise of their legislative oversight ju-
risdiction, in which event the requests would 
have been evaluated consistent with the 
long-standing confidentiality interests of the 
Executive Branch. See Watkins, 354 U.S. at 
187 (recognizing that Congress’s general in-
vestigative authority ‘‘comprehends probes 
into departments of the Federal Government 
to expose corruption, inefficiency or waste’’); 
McGrain, 273 U.S. at 179–80 (observing that it 
is not ‘‘a valid objection to the investigation 
that it might possibly disclose crime or 
wrongdoing on [the Attorney General’s] 
part’’). Should the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, or another committee, articulate a 
legitimate oversight purpose for a future in-
formation request, the Executive Branch 
would assess that request as part of the con-
stitutionally required accommodation proc-
ess. But the Executive Branch was not con-
fronted with that situation. The committee 
chairmen unequivocally attempted to con-
duct an impeachment inquiry into the Presi-
dent’s actions, without the House, which has 
the ‘‘sole Power of Impeachment,’’ having 
authorized such an investigation. Absent 
such an authorization, the committee chairs’ 
passing mention of ‘‘oversight and legisla-
tive jurisdiction’’ did not cure that funda-
mental defect. 
C. 
We next address whether the House ratified 
any of the previous committee subpoenas 
when it adopted Resolution 660 on October 
31, 2019—after weeks of objections from the 
Executive Branch and many members of 
Congress to the committees’ efforts to con-
duct an unauthorized impeachment inquiry. 
Resolution 660 provides that six committees 
of the House ‘‘are directed to continue their 
ongoing investigations as part of the exist-
ing House of Representatives inquiry into 
whether sufficient grounds exist for the 
House of Representatives to exercise its Con-
stitutional power to impeach Donald John 
Trump, President of the United States of 
America.’’ Resolution 660, § 1. The resolution 
further prescribes certain procedures by 
which HPSCI and the Judiciary Committee 
may conduct hearings in connection with the 
investigation defined by that resolution. 
Resolution 660 does not speak at all to the 
committees’ past actions or seek to ratify 
any subpoena previously issued by the House 
committees. See Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, 
941 F.3d 1180, 1182 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Rao, J., 
dissenting from the denial of rehearing en 
banc); see also Exclusion of Agency Counsel 
from Congressional Depositions in the Impeach-
ment Context, 43 Op. O.L.C. _, at *5 (Nov. 1, 
2019). The resolution ‘‘direct[s]’’ HPSCI and 
other committees to ‘‘continue’’ their inves-
tigations, and the Rules Committee appar-
ently assumed, incorrectly in our view, that 
earlier subpoenas were legally valid. See H.R. 
Rep. No. 116–266, at 3 (‘‘All subpoenas to the 
Executive Branch remain in full force.’’). But 
the resolution’s operative language does not 
address any previously issued subpoenas or 
provide the imprimatur of the House to give 
those subpoenas legal force. 
And the House knows how to ratify exist-
ing subpoenas when it chooses to do so.37 On 
July 24, 2019, the House adopted a resolution 
that expressly ‘‘ratif[ied] and affirm[ed] all 
current and future investigations, as well as 
all subpoenas previously issued or to be issued 
in the future,’’ related to certain enumerated 
subjects within the jurisdiction of standing 
or select committees of the House ‘‘as estab-
lished by the Constitution of the United 
States and rules X and XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives.’’ H.R. Res. 507, 
116th Cong. § 1 (2019) (emphasis added). There, 
as here, the House acted in response to ques-
tions regarding ‘‘the validity of .
.
. [com-
mittee] investigations and subpoenas.’’ Id. 
pmbl. Despite that recent model, Resolution 
660 contains no comparable language seeking 
to ratify previously issued subpoenas. The 
resolution directs certain committees to 
‘‘continue’’ investigations, and it specifies 
procedures to govern future hearings, but 
nothing in the resolution looks backward to 
actions previously taken. Accordingly, Reso-
lution 660 did not ratify or otherwise author-
ize 
the 
impeachment-related 
subpoenas 
issued before October 31, which therefore 
still had no compulsory effect on their re-
cipients. 
IV. 
Finally, we address some of the con-
sequences that followed from our conclusion 
that the committees’ pre-October 31 im-
peachment-related subpoenas were unauthor-
ized. First, because the subpoenas exceeded

the committees’ investigative authority and 
lacked compulsory effect, the committees 
were mistaken in contending that the recipi-
ents’ ‘‘failure or refusal to comply with the 
subpoena [would] constitute evidence of ob-
struction of the House’s impeachment in-
quiry.’’ Three Chairmen’s Letter, supra note 
2, at 1.38 As explained at length above, when 
the subpoenas were issued, there was no 
valid impeachment inquiry. To the extent 
that the committees’ subpoenas sought in-
formation in support of an unauthorized im-
peachment inquiry, the failure to comply 
with those subpoenas was no more punish-
able than were the failures of the witnesses 
in Watkins, Rumely, Kilbourn, and Lamont to 
answer questions that were beyond the scope 
of those committees’ authorized jurisdiction. 
See Watkins, 354 U.S. at 206, 215 (holding that 
conviction for contempt of Congress was in-
valid because, when the witness failed to an-
swer questions, the House had not used suffi-
cient ‘‘care .
.
. in authorizing the use of 
compulsory process’’ and the committee had 
not shown that the information was perti-
nent to a subject within ‘‘the mission[] dele-
gated to’’ it by the House); Rumely, 345 U.S. 
at 42–43, 48 (affirming reversal of conviction 
for contempt of Congress because it was not 
clear at the time of questioning that ‘‘the 
committee was authorized to exact the infor-
mation 
which 
the 
witness 
withheld’’); 
Kilbourn, 103 U.S. at 196 (sustaining action 
brought by witness for false imprisonment 
because the committee ‘‘had no lawful au-
thority to require Kilbourn to testify as a 
witness beyond what he voluntarily chose to 
tell’’); Lamont, 18 F.R.D. at 37 (dismissing in-
dictment for contempt of Congress in part 
because the indictment did not sufficiently 
allege, among other things, ‘‘that the [Per-
manent Subcommittee on Investigations] 
. . . was duly empowered by either House of 
Congress to conduct the particular inquiry’’ 
or ‘‘that the inquiry was within the scope of 
the 
authority 
granted 
to 
the 
[sub]committee’’). That alone suffices to pre-
vent noncompliance with the subpoenas from 
constituting ‘‘obstruction of the House’s im-
peachment inquiry.’’ 
Second, we note that whether or not the 
impeachment inquiry was authorized, there 
were other, independent grounds to support 
directions by the Executive Branch that wit-
nesses not appear in response to the commit-
tees’ subpoenas. We recently advised you 
that executive privilege continues to be 
available during an impeachment investiga-
tion. See Exclusion of Agency Counsel from 
Congressional Depositions in the Impeachment 
Context, 43 Op. O.L.C. __, at *2–5. The mere 
existence of an impeachment investigation 
does not eliminate the President’s need for 
confidentiality in connection with the per-
formance of his duties. Just as in the context 
of a criminal trial, a dispute over a request 
for privileged information in an impeach-
ment investigation must be resolved in a 
manner that ‘‘preserves the essential func-
tions of each branch.’’ United States v. Nixon, 
418 U.S. 683, 707 (1974). Thus, while a com-
mittee ‘‘may be able to establish an interest 
justifying its requests for information, the 
Executive Branch also has legitimate inter-
ests in confidentiality, and the resolution of 
these competing interests requires a careful 
balancing of each branch’s need in the con-
text of the particular information sought.’’ 
Exclusion of Agency Counsel from Congres-
sional Depositions in the Impeachment Context, 
43 Op. O.L.C. __, at *4. 
Accordingly, we recognized, in connection 
with HPSCI’s impeachment investigation 
after October 31, that the committee may 
not compel an executive branch witness to 
appear for a deposition without the assist-
ance of agency counsel, when that counsel is 
necessary to assist the witness in ensuring 
the appropriate protection of privileged in-
formation during the deposition. See id. at 
*4–5. In addition, we have concluded that the 
testimonial immunity of the President’s sen-
ior advisers ‘‘applies in an impeachment in-
quiry just as it applies in a legislative over-
sight inquiry.’’ Letter for Pat A. Cipollone, 
Counsel to the President, from Steven A. 
Engel, Assistant Attorney General, Office of 
Legal Counsel at 2 (Nov. 3, 2019). 
Thus, even when the House takes the steps 
necessary to authorize a committee to inves-
tigate impeachment and compel the produc-
tion of needed information, the Executive 
Branch continues to have legitimate inter-
ests to protect. The Constitution does not 
oblige either branch of government to sur-
render its legitimate prerogatives, but ex-
pects that each branch will negotiate in good 
faith with mutual respect for the needs of 
the other branch. See United States v. Am. Tel. 
& Tel. Co., 567 F.2d 121, 127 (D.C. Cir. 1977) 
(‘‘[E]ach branch should take cognizance of an 
implicit constitutional mandate to seek op-
timal accommodation through a realistic 
evaluation of the needs of the conflicting 
branches in the particular fact situation.’’); 
see also Memorandum for the Heads of Execu-
tive Departments and Agencies from Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan, Re: Procedures Gov-
erning Responses to Congressional Requests for 
Information (Nov. 4, 1982). The two branches 
should work to identify arrangements in the 
context of the particular requests of an in-
vestigating committee that accommodate 
both the committee’s needs and the Execu-
tive Branch’s interests. 
For these reasons, the House cannot plau-
sibly claim that any executive branch offi-
cial engaged in ‘‘obstruction’’ by failing to 
comply with committee subpoenas, or direct-
ing subordinates not to comply, in order to 
protect the Executive Branch’s legitimate 
interests in confidentiality and the separa-
tion of powers. We explained thirty-five 
years ago that ‘‘the Constitution does not 
permit Congress to make it a crime for an of-
ficial to assist the President in asserting a 
constitutional privilege that is an integral 
part of the President’s responsibilities under 
the Constitution.’’ Prosecution for Contempt of 
Congress of an Executive Branch Official Who 
Has Asserted a Claim of Executive Privilege, 8 
Op. O.L.C. 101, 140 (1984). Nor may Congress 
‘‘utilize its inherent ‘civil’ contempt powers 
to arrest, bring to trial, and punish an execu-
tive official who assert[s] a Presidential 
claim of executive privilege.’’ Id. at 140 n.42. 
We have reaffirmed those fundamental con-
clusions in each of the subsequent decades.39 
The constitutionally required accommoda-
tion process, of course, is a two-way street. 
In connection with this investigation, the 
House committees took the unprecedented 
steps of investigating the impeachment of a 
President without any authorization from 
the full House; without the procedural pro-
tections provided to Presidents Nixon and 
Clinton, see supra note 12; and with express 
threats of obstruction charges and unconsti-
tutional demands that officials appear and 
provide closed-door testimony about privi-
leged matters without the assistance of exec-
utive branch counsel. Absent any effort by 
the House committees to accommodate the 
Executive Branch’s legitimate concerns with 
the unprecedented nature of the committees’ 
actions, it was reasonable for executive 
branch officials to decline to comply with 
the subpoenas addressed to them. 
V. 
For the reasons set forth above, we con-
clude that the House must expressly author-
ize a committee to conduct an impeachment 
investigation and to use compulsory process 
in that investigation before the committee 
may compel the production of documents or 
testimony in support of the House’s ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment.’’ U.S. Const. art. I, 
§ 2, cl. 5. The House had not authorized such 
an investigation in connection with the im-
peachment-related subpoenas issued before 
October 31, 2019, and the subpoenas therefore 
had no compulsory effect. The House’s adop-
tion of Resolution 660 did not alter the legal 
status of those subpoenas, because the reso-
lution did not ratify them or otherwise ad-
dress their terms. 
Please let us know if we may be of further 
assistance.

ported to authorize the Bipartisan Legal Ad-
visory Group to approve future litigation.

nent select committee exercising authority 
thereunder has any and all necessary author-
ity under Article I of the Constitution.’’ Id.

thorized ‘‘under the first or second resolving 
clauses.’’ On the same day that the House

Therefore, neither the group, nor the House

tions, could assert the House’s authority in 
connection with an impeachment investiga-
tion, which is not a litigation matter.

mitted President Nixon’s counsel to submit 
and respond to evidence, to request to call 
witnesses, to attend hearings and examina-
tions, to object to the examination of wit-
nesses and the admissibility of testimony, 
and to question witnesses. See H.R. Rep. No. 
93–1305, at 8–9 (1974); 3 Deschler’s Precedents 
ch. 14, § 6.5, at 2045–47. Later, President Clin-
ton and his counsel were similarly ‘‘invited 
to attend all executive session and open com-
mittee hearings,’’ at which they were per-
mitted to ‘‘cross examine witnesses,’’ ‘‘make 
objections regarding the pertinency of evi-
dence,’’ ‘‘suggest that the Committee receive 
additional evidence,’’ and ‘‘respond to the 
evidence adduced by the Committee.’’ H.R. 
Rep. No. 105–795, at 25–26; see also 18 Deschler’s 
Precedents app. at 549 (2013) (noting that, dur-
ing the Clinton impeachment investigation, 
the House made a ‘‘deliberate attempt to 
mirror [the] documented precedents and pro-
ceedings’’ of the Nixon investigation). In a 
departure from the Nixon and Clinton prece-
dents, the House committees did not provide 
President Trump with any right to attend, 
participate in, or cross-examine witnesses in 
connection with the impeachment-related 
depositions conducted by the three commit-
tees before October 31. Resolution 660 simi-
larly did not provide any such rights with re-
spect to any of the public hearings conducted 
by HPSCI, limiting the President’s oppor-
tunity to participate to the Judiciary Com-
mittee, which did not itself participate in de-
veloping the investigative record upon which 
the articles of impeachment were premised. 
See H.R. Res. 660, 116th Cong. § 4(a); 165 Cong. 
Rec. E1357 (daily ed. Oct. 29, 2019) (‘‘Impeach-
ment Inquiry Procedures in the Committee 
on the Judiciary’’). 
13. In denying the congressional request 
before him, President Polk suggested, in the 
equivalent of dictum, that, during an im-
peachment inquiry, ‘‘all the archives and pa-
pers of the Executive departments, public or 
private, would be subject to the inspection 
and control of a committee of their body.’’ 
Cong. Globe, 29th Cong., 1st Sess. 698 (1846). 
That statement, however, dramatically un-
derstates the degree to which executive 
privilege remains available during an im-
peachment investigation to protect confiden-
tiality interests necessary to preserve the es-
sential functions of the Executive Branch. 
See Exclusion of Agency Counsel from Congres-
sional Depositions in the Impeachment Context, 
43 Op. O.L.C. _, at *3 & n.1 (Nov. 1, 2019). In 
a prior opinion, this Office viewed Polk as 
acknowledging the continued availability of 
executive privilege, because we read Polk’s 
preceding sentence as ‘‘indicat[ing]’’ that, 
even in the impeachment context, ‘‘the Ex-
ecutive branch ‘would adopt all wise pre-
cautions to prevent the exposure of all such 
matters the publication of which might inju-
riously affect the public interest, except so 
far as this might be necessary to accomplish 
the great ends of public justice.’ ’’ Memo-
randum for Elliot Richardson, Attorney Gen-
eral, from Robert G. Dixon, Jr., Assistant 
Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, 
Re: Presidential Immunity from Coercive Con-
gressional Demands for Information at 22–23 
(July 24, 1973) (quoting Polk’s letter). 
14. See, e.g., Cong. Globe, 29th Cong., 1st 
Sess. 636 (1846) (statement of Rep. Ingersoll) 
(‘‘Whether . . . [Webster’s] offences will be 
deemed impeachable misdemeanors in office, 
conviction for which might remove him from 
the Senate, and disqualify him to hold any 
office of honor, trust, or profit, under the 
United States, will remain to be consid-
ered.’’); Todd Garvey, The Webster and Inger-
soll Investigations, in Morton Rosenberg, The 
Constitution Project, When Congress Comes 
Calling 289 (2017). 
15. When the House first considered im-
peachment in 1796, Attorney General Charles 
Lee advised that, ‘‘before an impeachment is 
sent to the Senate, witnesses must be exam-
ined, in solemn form, respecting the charges, 
before a committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives, to be appointed for that pur-
pose.’’ Letter for the House of Representa-
tives from Charles Lee, Attorney General, 
Re: Inquiry into the Official Conduct of a Judge 
of the Supreme Court of the Northwestern Terri-
tory (May 9, 1796), reprinted in 1 Am. State 
Papers: Misc. 151 (Walter Lowrie & Walter S. 
Franklin eds., 1834). Because the charges of 
misconduct concerned the actions of George 
Turner, a territorial judge, and the witnesses 
were located in far-away St. Clair County 
(modern-day Illinois), Lee suggested that the 
‘‘most solemn’’ mode of prosecution, an im-
peachment trial before the Senate, would be 
‘‘very inconvenient, if not entirely impracti-
cable.’’ Id. Lee informed the House that 
President Washington had directed the terri-
torial governor to arrange for a criminal 
prosecution before the territorial court. See 
id. The House committee considering the pe-
tition about Turner agreed with Lee’s sug-
gestion and recommended that the House 
take no further action. See Inquiry into the 
Official Conduct of a Judge of the Supreme 
Court of the Northwestern Territory (Feb. 27, 
1797), reprinted in 1 Am. State Papers: Misc. 
at 157. 
16. After the House impeached Senator 
Blount, the Senate voted to dismiss the 
charges on the ground that a Senator is not 
a civil officer subject to impeachment. See 3 
Hinds’ Precedents § 2318, at 678–80. 
17. A 2007 overview concluded that ‘‘[t]here 
have been approximately 94 identifiable im-
peachment-related inquiries conducted by 
Congress[.]’’ H.R. Doc. No. 109–153, at 115 
(2007). Since 2007, two more judges have been 
impeached following authorized investiga-
tions. 
18. The district court’s erroneous conclu-
sions rested upon the arguments offered by 
the House Judiciary Committee, which re-
lied principally upon the judicial outliers 
from the 1980s, a misunderstanding of the 
Nixon 
impeachment 
inquiry, 
and 
a 
misreading of the committee’s subpoena 
power under the House Rules. See Applica-
tion at 33–34, In re Application of the Comm. on 
the Judiciary (D.D.C. July 26, 2019); Reply of 
the Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House 
of Representatives, in Support of Its Applica-
tion for an Order Authorizing the Release of 
Certain Grand Jury Materials, at 16 n.19, In 
re Application of the Comm. on the Judiciary 
(D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2019). HPSCI and the Judici-
ary Committee later reiterated these argu-
ments in their reports, each contending that 
executive branch officials had ‘‘obstructed’’ 
the House’s impeachment inquiry by declin-
ing to comply with the pre-October 31 im-
peachment-related subpoenas. H.R. Rep. No. 
116–335, at 168–72, 175–77 (2019); H.R. Rep. No. 
116–346, at 10, 13–16 (2019). But those reports 
asserted that the pre-October 31 subpoenas 
were authorized because the committees 
misunderstood the historical practice con-
cerning the House’s impeachment inquiries 
(as we discuss in Part II.C) and they misread 
the committees’ subpoena authority under 
the House Rules (as we discuss in Part III.A). 
19. See, e.g., Cong. Globe, 27th Cong., 3d 
Sess. 144, 146 (1843) (John Tyler); Cong. Globe, 
39th Cong., 2d Sess. 320 (1867) (Andrew John-
son); 28 Cong. Rec. 5627, 5650 (1896) (Grover 
Cleveland); 76 Cong. Rec. 399–402 (1932) (Her-
bert Hoover); H.R. Res. 607, 82d Cong. (1952) 
(Harry Truman); H.R. Res. 625, 93d Cong. 
(1973) (Richard Nixon); H.R. Res. 370, 98th 
Cong. (1983) (Ronald Reagan); H.R. Res. 34, 
102d Cong. (1991) (George H.W. Bush); H.R. 
Res. 525, 105th Cong. (1998) (Bill Clinton); 
H.R. Res. 1258, 110th Cong. (2008) (George W. 
Bush); H.R. Res. 13, 106th Cong. (2019) (Don-
ald Trump). 
20. In 1860, the House authorized an inves-
tigation 
into 
the 
actions 
of 
President 
Buchanan, but that investigation was not 
styled as an impeachment investigation. See 
Cong. Globe, 36th Cong., 1st Sess. 997–98 (1860) 
(resolution establishing a committee of five 
members 
to 
‘‘investigat[e] 
whether 
the 
President of the United States, or any other 
officer of the government, ha[d], by money, 
patronage, or other improper means, sought 
to influence the action of Congress’’ or ‘‘by 
combination or otherwise, . . . attempted to 
prevent or defeat, the execution of any 
law’’). It appears to have been understood by 
the committee as an oversight investigation. 
See H.R. Rep. No. 36–648, at 1–28 (1860). 
Buchanan in fact objected to the House’s use 
of its legislative jurisdiction to circumvent 
the protections traditionally provided in 
connection with impeachment. See Message 
for the U.S. House of Representatives from 
James Buchanan (June 22, 1860), reprinted in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S366 
January 21, 2020 
the Presidents 625 (James D. Richardson ed., 
1897) (objecting that if the House suspects 
presidential misconduct, it should ‘‘transfer 
the question from [its] legislative to [its] ac-
cusatory jurisdiction, and take care that in 
all the preliminary judicial proceedings pre-
paratory to the vote of articles of impeach-
ment the accused should enjoy the benefit of 
cross-examining the witnesses and all the 
other safeguards with which the Constitu-
tion surrounds every American citizen’’); see 
also Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 762 (Rao, J., dis-
senting) (discussing the episode). 
21. The district court’s recent decision in 
In re Application of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary misreads Hinds’ Precedents to suggest 
that the House Judiciary Committee (which 
the court called ‘‘HJC’’) began investigating 
President Johnson’s impeachment without 
any authorizing resolution. According to the 
district court, ‘‘a resolution authoriz[ing]’ 
HJC to inquire into the official conduct of 
Andrew Johnson’ was passed after HJC ‘was 
already considering the subject.’ ’’ 2019 WL 
5485221, at *27 (quoting 3 Hinds’ Precedents 
§ 2400, at 824). In fact, the committee was ‘‘al-
ready considering the subject’’ at the time of 
the February 4 resolution described in the 
quoted sentence because, as explained in the 
text above, the House had previously adopted 
a separate resolution authorizing an im-
peachment investigation. See Cong. Globe, 
39th Cong., 2d Sess. 320–21 (1867); 3 Hinds’ 
Precedents § 2400, at 824. 
22. See, e.g., H.R. Res. 625, 631, 635, and 638, 
93d Cong. (1973) (impeachment); H.R. Res. 
626, 627, 628, 636, and 637, 93d Cong. (1973) (Ju-
diciary Committee or subcommittee inves-
tigation). 
23. A New York Times article the following 
day characterized House Resolution 803 as 
‘‘formally ratif[ying] the impeachment in-
quiry begun by the committee [the prior] Oc-
tober.’’ James M. Naughton, House, 410–4, 
Gives Subpoena Power in Nixon Inquiry, N.Y. 
Times, Feb. 7, 1974, at 1. But the resolution 
did not grant after-the-fact authorization for 
any prior action. To the contrary, the reso-
lution ‘‘authorized and directed’’ a future in-
vestigation, including by providing subpoena 
power. In the report recommending adoption 
of the resolution, the committee likewise de-
scribed its plans in the future tense: ‘‘It is 
the intention of the committee that its in-
vestigation will be conducted in all respects 
on a fair, impartial and bipartisan basis.’’ 
H.R. Rep. No. 93–774, at 3 (1974). 
24. As with Presidents, many of these reso-
lutions remained with the committees until 
they expired at the end of the Congress. Sev-
eral merely articulated allegations of im-
peachment. See, e.g., H.R. Res. 1028, 115th 
Cong. (2018) (Deputy Attorney General Rod 
Rosenstein); H.R. Res. 417, 114th Cong. (2015) 
(Administrator of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency Regina McCarthy); H.R. Res. 
411, 113th Cong. (2013) (Attorney General Eric 
Holder); H.R. Res. 333, 110th Cong. (2007) 
(Vice President Richard Cheney); H.R. Res. 
629, 108th Cong. (2004) (Secretary of Defense 
Donald Rumsfeld); H.R. Res. 805, 95th Cong. 
(1977) (United Nations Ambassador Andrew 
Young); H.R. Res. 274, 95th Cong. (1977) (Com-
missioner of the Federal Trade Commission 
Paul Dixon); H.R. Res. 881, 94th Cong. (1975) 
(U.S. Attorney Jonathan Goldstein and Prin-
cipal Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Gold-
stein); H.R. Res. 647, 94th Cong. (1975) (Am-
bassador to Iran Richard Helms); H.R. Res. 
547, 94th Cong. (1975) (Special Crime Strike 
Force Prosecutor Liam Coonan). Others 
called for an investigation. See, e.g., H.R. 
Res. 589, 110th Cong. (2007) (Attorney General 
Alberto Gonzales); H.R. Res. 582, 105th Cong. 
(1998) (Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr); 
H.R. Res. 102, 99th Cong. (1985) (Chairman of 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve System Paul Volcker); H.R. Res. 101, 
99th Cong. (1985) (same and others); H.R. Res. 
1025, 95th Cong. (1978) (Attorney General 
Griffin Bell); H.R. Res. 1002, 95th Cong. (1978) 
(same); H.R. Res. 569, 93d Cong. (1973) (Vice 
President Spiro Agnew); H.R. Res. 67, 76th 
Cong. (1939) (Secretary of Labor Frances Per-
kins and others); 28 Cong. Rec. 114, 126 (1895) 
(Ambassador to Great Britain Thomas Bay-
ard); 16 Cong. Rec. 17–19 (1884) (U.S. Marshal 
Lot Wright); Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 1st 
Sess. 778–79 (1867) (Minister to Great Britain 
Charles Francis Adams). On occasion, the 
House voted to table these resolutions in-
stead of referring them to a committee. See, 
e.g., H.R. Res. 545, 105th Cong. (1998) (resolu-
tion of impeachment for Independent Coun-
sel Kenneth Starr); H.R. Res. 1267, 95th Cong. 
(1978) (resolution of impeachment for Ambas-
sador to the United Nations Andrew Young). 
25. In 1878, the Committee on Expenditures 
in the State Department, which was charged 
with investigative authority for ‘‘the expos-
ing of frauds or abuses of any kind,’’ 7 Cong. 
Rec. 287, 290 (1878), was referred an investiga-
tion into maladministration at the consulate 
in Shanghai during the terms of Consul-Gen-
eral George Seward and Vice Consul-General 
O.B. Bradford, id. at 504, 769. Eventually, the 
committee began to consider Seward’s im-
peachment, serving him with a subpoena for 
testimony and documents, in response to 
which he asserted his privilege against self- 
incrimination. See 3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2514, 
at 1023–24; H.R. Rep. No. 45–141, at 1–3 (1879). 
The committee recommended articles of im-
peachment, but the House declined to act be-
fore the end of the Congress. See 8 Cong. Rec. 
2350–55 (1879); 3 Hinds’ Precedents § 2514, at 
1025. During this same period, the Committee 
on Expenditures reported proposed articles 
of impeachment against Bradford but rec-
ommended ‘‘that the whole subject be re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary’’ 
for further consideration. H.R. Rep. No. 45– 
818, at 7 (1878). The House agreed to the refer-
ral, but no further action was taken. 7 Cong. 
Rec. at 3667.

27. Articles for the Impeachment of Lebbeus R. 
Wilfley, Judge of the U.S. Court for China: 
Hearings Before a Subcomm. of the H. Comm. on 
the Judiciary, 60th Cong. 4 (1908) (statement 
of Rep. Waldo); see also id. at 45–46 (state-
ment of Rep. Moon) (‘‘This committee con-
ceives to be its duty solely, under the resolu-
tion referring this matter to them, to exam-
ine the charges preferred in the petition . . . 
and to report thereon whether in its judge-
ment the petitioner has made out a prima 
facie case; and also whether . . . Congress 
should adopt a resolution instructing the Ju-
diciary Committee to proceed to an inves-
tigation of the facts of the case.’’); 6 Can-
non’s Precedents § 525, at 743– 45 (summarizing 
the Wilfley case, in which the Judiciary 
Committee ultimately reported that no for-
mal investigation was warranted). The case 
of Judge Samuel Alschuler in 1935 similarly 
involved only a preliminary investigation— 
albeit one with actual investigative powers. 
The House first referred to the Judiciary 
Committee a resolution that, if approved, 
would authorize an investigation of potential 
impeachment charges. See 79 Cong. Rec. 7086, 
7106 (1935). Six days later, it adopted a reso-
lution that granted the committee investiga-
tive powers in support of ‘‘the preliminary 
examinations deemed necessary’’ for the 
committee to make a recommendation about 
whether a full investigation should occur. Id. 
at 7393–94. The committee ultimately rec-
ommended against a full investigation. See 
H.R. Rep. No. 74–1802, at 2 (1935). 
28. See, e.g., 18 Annals of Cong. 1885–86, 2197– 
98 (1808) (Harry Innes, 1808; the House passed 
a resolution authorizing an impeachment in-
vestigation, which concluded that the evi-
dence accompanying the resolution did not 
support impeachment); 3 Hinds’ Precedents 
§ 2486, at 981–83 (George Turner, 1796; no ap-
parent investigation, presumably because of 
the 
parallel 
criminal 
prosecution 
rec-
ommended by Attorney General Lee, as dis-
cussed above); id. § 2488, at 985 (Harry 
Toulmin, 1811; the House ‘‘declined to order 
a formal investigation’’); 40 Annals of Cong. 
463–69, 715–18 (1822–23) (Charles Tait, 1823; no 
apparent investigation beyond examination 
of documents containing charges); 3 Hinds’ 
Precedents § 2493, at 991–92 (Benjamin John-
son, 1833; no apparent investigation); id. 
§ 2511, at 1019–20 (Charles Sherman, 1873; the 
Judiciary Committee received evidence from 
the Ways and Means Committee, which had 
been investigating corruption in Congress, 
but the Judiciary Committee conducted no 
further investigation); 6 Cannon’s Precedents 
§ 535, at 769 (Kenesaw Mountain Landis, 1921; 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
reported 
that 
‘‘charges were filed too late in the present 
session of the Congress’’ to enable investiga-
tion); 3 Deschler’s Precedents ch. 14, § 14.6, at

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S367 
January 21, 2020 
30. The House did pass resolutions author-
izing funds for investigations with respect to 
the Hastings impeachment, see H.R. Res. 134, 
100th Cong. (1987); H.R. Res. 388, 100th Cong. 
(1988), and resolutions authorizing the com-
mittee to permit its counsel to take affida-
vits and depositions in both the Nixon and 
Hastings impeachments, see H.R. Res. 562, 
100th Cong. (1988) (Nixon); H.R. Res. 320, 
100th Cong. (1987) (Hastings). 
31. In the post-1989 era, as before, most of 
the impeachment resolutions against judges 
that were referred to the Judiciary Com-
mittee did not result in any further inves-
tigation. See, e.g., H.R. Res. 916, 109th Cong. 
(2006) (Manuel Real); H.R. Res. 207, 103d Cong. 
(1993) (Robert Collins); H.R. Res. 177, 103d 
Cong. (1993) (Robert Aguilar); H.R. Res. 176, 
103d Cong. (1993) (Robert Collins). 
32. Unlike the House, ‘‘the Senate treats 
its rules as remaining in effect continuously 
from one Congress to the next without hav-
ing to be re-adopted.’’ Richard S. Beth, Cong. 
Research Serv., R42929, Procedures for Consid-
ering Changes in Senate Rules 9 (Jan. 22, 2013). 
Of course, like the House, the Senate may 
change its rules by simple resolution. 
33. Nor do the Rules otherwise give the 
Speaker the authority to order an investiga-
tion or issue a subpoena in connection with 
impeachment. Rule I sets out the powers of 
the Speaker. She ‘‘shall sign . . . all writs, 
warrants, and subpoenas of, or issued by 
order of, the House.’’ Rule I, cl. 4. But that 
provision applies only when the House itself 
issues an order. See Jefferson’s Manual § 626, 
at 348. 
34. Clause 2(m) of Rule XI was initially 
adopted on October 8, 1974, and took effect on 
January 3, 1975. See H.R. Res. 988, 93d Cong. 
The rule appears to have remained materi-
ally unchanged from 1975 to the present (in-
cluding during the time of the Clinton inves-
tigation). See H.R. Rule XI, cl. 2(m), 105th 
Cong. (Jan. 1, 1998) (version in effect during 
the Clinton investigation); Jefferson’s Manual 
§ 805, at 586–89 (reprinting current version 
and describing the provision’s evolution). 
35. At the start of the 93rd Congress in 1973, 
the Judiciary Committee was ‘‘authorized to 
conduct full and complete studies and inves-
tigations and make inquiries within its juris-
diction as set forth in [the relevant provi-
sion] of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives’’ and was empowered ‘‘to hold such 
hearings and require, by subpena or other-
wise, the attendance and testimony of such 
witnesses and the production of such books, 
records, correspondence, memorandums, pa-
pers, and documents, as it deems necessary.’’ 
H.R. Res. 74, 93d Cong. §§ 1, 2(a) (1973); see also 
Cong. Research Serv., R45769, The Impeach-
ment Process in the House of Representatives 4 
(updated Nov. 14, 2019) (noting that, before 
Rule XI vested subpoena power in standing 
committees, the Judiciary Committee and 
other committees had often been given sub-
poena authority ‘‘through resolutions pro-
viding 
blanket 
investigatory 
authorities 
that were agreed to at the start of a Con-
gress’’). 
36. The Judiciary Committee has also in-
voked House Resolution 430 as an inde-
pendent source of authority for an impeach-
ment inquiry. See Tr. of Mot. Hrg. at 91–92, In 
re Application of the Comm. on the Judiciary; 
see also Majority Staff of H. Comm. on the 
Judiciary, 116th Cong., Constitutional Grounds 
for Presidential Impeachment 39 (Dec. 2019). As 
discussed above, however, that resolution did 
not 
confer 
any 
investigative 
authority. 
Rather, it granted ‘‘any and all necessary 
authority under Article I’’ only ‘‘in connec-
tion with’’ certain ‘‘judicial proceeding[s]’’ 
in federal court. H.R. Res. 430, 116th Cong. 
(2019); see supra note 7. The resolution there-
fore had no bearing on any committee’s au-
thority to compel the production of docu-
ments or testimony in an impeachment in-
vestigation. 
37. Even if the House had sought to ratify 
a previously issued subpoena, it could give 
that subpoena only prospective effect. As 
discussed above, the Supreme Court has rec-
ognized that the House may not cite a wit-
ness for contempt for failure to comply with 
a subpoena unsupported by a valid delega-
tion of authority at the time it was issued. 
See Rumely, 345 U.S. at 48; see also Exxon, 589 
F.2d at 592 (‘‘To issue a valid subpoena, . . . 
a committee or subcommittee must conform 
strictly to the resolution establishing its in-
vestigatory powers[.]’’). 
38. The letters accompanying other sub-
poenas, see supra note 9, contained similar 
threats that the recipients’ ‘‘failure or re-
fusal to comply with the subpoena, including 
at the direction or behest of the President,’’ 
would constitute ‘‘evidence of obstruction of 
the House’s impeachment inquiry.’’

Counsel from Congressional Depositions of 
Agency Employees, 43 Op. O.L.C. __, at *14 
(May 23, 2019) (‘‘[I]t would be unconstitu-
tional to enforce a subpoena against an agen-
cy employee who declined to appear before

LETTER OPINIONS FROM THE OFFICE OF 
LEGAL COUNSEL TO COUNSEL TO THE 
PRESIDENT REGARDING ABSOLUTE IM-
MUNITY OF THE ACTING CHIEF OF 
STAFF, LEGAL ADVISOR TO THE NA-
TIONAL SECURITY COUNSEL, AND DEP-
UTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 
OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, 
Washington, DC, October 25, 2019. 
PAT A. CIPOLLONE, 
Counsel to the President, The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CIPOLLONE: Today, the Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence of the 
House of Representatives issued a subpoena 
seeking 
to 
compel 
Charles 
Kupperman, 
former Assistant to the President and Dep-
uty National Security Advisor, to testify on 
Monday, October 28. The Committee subpoe-
naed Mr. Kupperman as part of its purported 
impeachment inquiry into the conduct of the 
President. The Administration has pre-
viously explained to the Committee that the 
House has not authorized an impeachment 
inquiry, and therefore, the Committee may 
not compel testimony in connection with the 
inquiry. Setting aside the question whether 
the inquiry has been lawfully authorized, 
you have asked whether the Committee may 
compel Mr. Kupperman to testify even as-
suming an authorized subpoena. We conclude 
that he is absolutely immune from com-
pelled congressional testimony in his capac-
ity as a former senior adviser to the Presi-
dent. 
The Committee seeks Mr. Kupperman’s 
testimony about matters related to his offi-
cial duties at the White House. We under-
stand that Committee staff informed Mr. 
Kupperman’s private counsel that the Com-
mittee wishes to question him about the 
telephone call between President Trump and 
the President of Ukraine that took place on 
July 25, 2019, during Mr. Kupperman’s tenure 
as a presidential adviser, and related mat-
ters. See ‘‘Urgent Concern’’ Determination by 
the Inspector General of the Intelligence Com-
munity, 43 Op. O.L.C. __, at *1–3 (Sept. 3, 2019) 
(discussing the July 25 telephone call). 
The Department of Justice has for decades 
taken the position, and this Office recently 
reaffirmed, that ‘‘Congress may not con-
stitutionally compel the President’s senior 
advisers to testify about their official du-
ties.’’ Testimonial Immunity Before Congress of 
the Former Counsel to the President, 43 Op. 
O.L.C. ____, at *1 (May 20, 2019) (‘‘Immunity of 
the Former Counsel’’). This testimonial im-
munity is rooted in the separation of powers 
and derives from the President’s status as 
the head of a separate, co-equal branch of 
government. See id at *3–7. Because the 
President’s closest advisers serve as his alter 
egos, compelling them to testify would un-
dercut the ‘‘independence and autonomy’’ of 
the Presidency, id. at *4, and interfere di-
rectly with the President’s ability to faith-
fully discharge his responsibilities. Absent 
immunity, ‘‘congressional committees could 
wield their compulsory power to attempt to 
supervise the President’s actions, or to har-
ass those advisers in an effort to influence 
their conduct, retaliate for actions the com-
mittee disliked, or embarrass and weaken 
the President for partisan gain.’’ Immunity of 
the Assistant to the President and Director of 
the Office of Political Strategy and Outreach 
From Congressional Subpoena, 38 Op. O.L.C. __, 
at *3 (July 15, 2014). Congressional ques-
tioning of the President’s senior advisers 
would also undermine the independence and 
candor of executive branch deliberations. See 
Immunity of the Former Counsel, 43 Op. O.L.C. 
at *5–7. Administrations of both political 
parties have insisted on the immunity of 
senior presidential advisers, which is critical 
to protect the institution of the Presidency. 
Assertion of Executive Privilege with Respect to 
Clemency Decision, 23 Op. O.L.C. 1, 5 (1999) 
(A.G. Reno). 
Mr. Kupperman qualifies as a senior presi-
dential adviser entitled to immunity. The 
testimonial immunity applies to the Presi-
dent’s ‘‘immediate advisers—that is, those 
who customarily meet with the President on 
a regular or frequent basis.’’ Memorandum 
for John D. Ehrlichman, Assistant to the 
President for Domestic Affairs, from William 
H. Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney General, 
Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Power of Congres-
sional Committee to Compel Appearance or Tes-
timony of ‘‘White House Staff’’ at 7 (Feb. 5, 
1971). Your office has informed us that Mr. 
Kupperman served as the sole deputy to Na-
tional Security Advisor John R. Bolton, and 
briefly served as Acting National Security 
Advisor after Mr. Bolton’s departure. As 
Deputy 
National 
Security 
Advisor, 
Mr. 
Kupperman generally met with the President 
multiple times per week to advise him on a 
wide range of national security matters, and 
he met with the President even more often

during the frequent periods when Mr. Bolton 
was traveling. Mr. Kupperman participated 
in sensitive internal deliberations with the 
President and other senior advisers, main-
tained an office in the West Wing of the 
White House, traveled with the President on 
official trips abroad on multiple occasions, 
and regularly attended the presentation of 
the President’s Daily Brief and meetings of 
the National Security Council presided over 
by the President. 
Mr. Kupperman’s immunity from com-
pelled testimony is strengthened because his 
duties concerned national security. The Su-
preme Court held in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 
U.S. 800 (1982), that senior presidential advis-
ers do not enjoy absolute immunity from 
civil liability—a holding that, as we have 
previously explained, does not conflict with 
our recognition of absolute immunity from 
compelled congressional testimony for such 
advisers, see, e.g., Immunity of the Former 
Counsel, 43 Op. O.L.C. at *13–14. Yet the Har-
low Court recognized that ‘‘[f]or aides en-
trusted with discretionary authority in such 
sensitive areas as national security or for-
eign policy,’’ even absolute immunity from 
suit ‘‘might well be justified to protect the 
unhesitating performance of functions vital 
to the national interest.’’ 457 U.S. at 812; see 
also id. at 812 n.19 (‘‘a derivative claim to 
Presidential immunity would be strongest in 
such ‘central’ Presidential domains as for-
eign policy and national security, in which 
the President could not discharge his sin-
gularly vital mandate without delegating 
functions nearly as sensitive as his own’’). 
Immunity is also particularly justified 
here because the Committee apparently 
seeks Mr. Kupperman’ s testimony about the 
President’s conduct of relations with a for-
eign government. The President has the con-
stitutional responsibility to conduct diplo-
matic relations, see Assertion of Executive 
Privilege for Documents Concerning Conduct of 
Foreign Affairs with Respect to Haiti, 20 Op. 
O.L.C. 5, 7 (1996) (A.G. Reno), and as a result, 
the President has the ‘‘exclusive authority 
to determine the time, scope, and objectives 
of international negotiations.’’ Unconstitu-
tional Restrictions on Activities of the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy in Section 
1340(a) of the Department of Defense and Full- 
Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, 35 
Op. O.L.C. __, at *4 (Sept. 19, 2011) (quotation 
marks 
omitted). 
Compelling 
testimony 
about these sensitive constitutional respon-
sibilities would only deepen the very con-
cerns—about separation of powers and con-
fidentiality—that underlie the rationale for 
testimonial immunity. See New York Times 
Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 728 (1971) 
(Stewart, J., concurring) (‘‘[I]t is elementary 
that the successful conduct of international 
diplomacy and the maintenance of an effec-
tive national defense require both confiden-
tiality and secrecy.’’). 
Finally, it is inconsequential that Mr. 
Kupperman is now a private citizen. In Im-
munity of the Former Counsel, we reaffirmed 
that for purposes of testimonial immunity, 
there is ‘‘no material distinction’’ between 
‘‘current and former senior advisers to the 
President,’’ and therefore, an adviser’s de-
parture from the White House staff ‘‘does not 
alter his immunity from compelled congres-
sional testimony on matters related to his 
service to the President.’’ 43 Op. O.L.C. at 
*16; see also Immunity of the Former Counsel to 
the President from Compelled Congressional 
Testimony, 31 Op. O.L.C. 191, 192–93 (2007). It is 
sufficient that the Committee seeks Mr. 
Kupperman’s testimony on matters related 
to his official duties at the White House. 
Please let us know if we may be of further 
assistance.

Assistant Attorney General. 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 
OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, 
Washington, DC, November 3, 2019. 
PAT A. CIPOLLONE, 
Counsel to the President, The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CIPOLLONE: On November 1, 2019, 
the Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence of the House of Representatives 
issued a subpoena seeking to compel John 
Eisenberg to testify at a deposition on Mon-
day, November 4. Mr. Eisenberg serves as As-
sistant to the President, Deputy Counsel to 
the President for National Security Affairs, 
and Legal Advisor to the National Security 
Council. The Committee subpoenaed Mr. 
Eisenberg as part of its impeachment inquiry 
into the conduct of the President. See H.R. 
Res. 660, 116th Cong. (2019). You have asked 
whether the Committee may compel Mr. 
Eisenberg to testify. We conclude that he is 
absolutely immune from compelled congres-
sional testimony in his capacity as a senior 
adviser to the President. 
The Committee has made clear that it 
seeks to question Mr. Eisenberg about mat-
ters related to his official duties at the 
White House. The Committee informed him 
that it is investigating the President’s con-
duct of foreign relations with Ukraine and 
that it believes, ‘‘[b]ased upon public report-
ing and evidence gathered as part of the im-
peachment inquiry,’’ that Mr. Eisenberg has 
‘‘information relevant to these matters.’’ 
Letter for John Eisenberg from Adam B. 
Schiff, Chairman, House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, et al. at 1 (Oct. 
30, 2019); see also Letter for John Eisenberg 
from Adam B. Schiff, Chairman, House Per-
manent Select Committee on Intelligence, et 
al. at 1 (Nov. 1, 2019). 
The Executive Branch has taken the posi-
tion for decades that ‘‘Congress may not con-
stitutionally compel the President’s senior 
advisers to testify about their official du-
ties.’’ Testimonial Immunity Before Congress of 
the Former Counsel to the President, 43 Op. 
O.L.C. __, at *1 (May 20, 2019) (‘‘Immunity of 
the Former Counsel’’). This testimonial im-
munity is rooted in the separation of powers 
and derives from the President’s status as 
the head of a separate, co-equal branch of 
government. See id. at *3–7. Because the 
President’s closest advisers serve as his alter 
egos, compelling them to testify would un-
dercut the ‘‘independence and autonomy’’ of 
the Presidency, id. at *4, and interfere di-
rectly with the President’s ability to faith-
fully discharge his constitutional respon-
sibilities. Absent immunity, ‘‘congressional 
committees could wield their compulsory 
power to attempt to supervise the Presi-
dent’s actions, or to harass those advisers in 
an effort to influence their conduct, retali-
ate for actions the committee disliked, or 
embarrass and weaken the President for par-
tisan gain.’’ Immunity of the Assistant to the 
President and Director of the Office of Political 
Strategy and Outreach From Congressional Sub-
poena, 38 Op. O.L.C. __, at *3 (July 15, 2014) 
(‘‘Immunity of the Assistant to the President’’). 
Congressional questioning of the President’s 
senior advisers would also undermine the 
independence and candor of executive branch 
deliberations. See Immunity of the Former 
Counsel, 43 Op. O.L.C. at *5–7. For these rea-
sons, the Executive Branch has long recog-
nized the immunity of senior presidential ad-
visers to be critical to protecting the institu-
tion of the Presidency. 
This testimonial immunity applies in an 
impeachment inquiry just as it applies in a 
legislative oversight inquiry. As our Office 
recently advised you, executive privilege re-
mains available when a congressional com-
mittee conducts an impeachment investiga-
tion. See Letter for Pat A. Cipollone, Counsel 
to the President, from Steven A. Engel, As-
sistant Attorney General, Office of Legal 
Counsel at 2 & n.l (Nov. 1, 2019). The testi-
monial immunity of senior presidential ad-
visers is ‘‘broader’’ than executive privilege 
and exists in part to prevent the inadvertent 
disclosure of privileged information, Immu-
nity of the Former Counsel, 43 Op. O.L.C. at *4, 
*6, so it follows that testimonial immunity 
also continues to apply in the impeachment 
context. More importantly, the commence-
ment of an impeachment inquiry only 
heightens the need to safeguard the separa-
tion of powers and preserve the ‘‘independ-
ence and autonomy’’ of the Presidency—the 
principal concerns underlying testimonial 
immunity. Id. at *4. Even when impeachment 
proceedings are underway, the President 
must remain able to continue to discharge 
the duties of his office. The testimonial im-
munity of the President’s senior advisers re-
mains an important limitation to protect 
the independence and autonomy of the Presi-
dent himself. 
We do not doubt that there may be im-
peachment 
investigations 
in 
which 
the 
House will have a legitimate need for infor-
mation possessed by the President’s senior 
advisers, but the House may have a legiti-
mate need in a legislative oversight inquiry. 
In both instances, the testimonial immunity 
of the President’s senior advisers will not 
prevent the House from obtaining informa-
tion from other available sources. The im-
munity of those immediate advisers will not 
itself prevent the House from obtaining tes-
timony from others in the Executive Branch, 
including in the White House, or from ob-
taining pertinent documents (although the 
House may still need to overcome executive 
privilege with respect to testimony and doc-
uments to which the privilege applies). In ad-
dition, the President may choose to author-
ize his senior advisers to provide testimony 
because ‘‘the benefit of providing such testi-
mony as an accommodation to a committee’s 
interests outweighs the potential for harass-
ment and harm to Executive Branch con-
fidentiality.’’ Immunity of the Assistant to the 
President, 38 Op. O.L.C. at *4 n.2. Accordingly, 
our recognition that the immunity applies to 
an impeachment inquiry does not preclude 
the House from obtaining information from 
other sources. 
We next consider whether Mr. Eisenberg 
qualifies as a senior presidential adviser. The 
testimonial immunity applies to the Presi-
dent’s ‘‘immediate advisers—that is, those 
who customarily meet with the President on 
a regular or frequent basis.’’ Memorandum 
for John D. Ehrlichman, Assistant to the 
President for Domestic Affairs, from William 
H. Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney General, 
Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Power of Congres-
sional Committee to Compel Appearance or Tes-
timony of ‘‘White House Staff’’ at 7 (Feb. 5, 
1971). We believe that Mr. Eisenberg meets 
that definition. Mr. Eisenberg has served as 
an adviser to the President on sensitive legal 
and national security matters since the first 
day of the Administration, and his direct re-
lationship with the President has grown over 
time. Your office has informed us that he 
regularly meets with the President multiple 
times each week, frequently in very small 
groups, and often communicates with the 
President multiple times per day. He is one 
of a small number of advisers who are au-
thorized to contact the President directly, 
and the President directly seeks his advice. 
Mr. Eisenberg is therefore the kind of imme-
diate presidential adviser that the Executive 
Branch has historically considered immune 
from compelled congressional testimony. 
Mr. Eisenberg’s eligibility for immunity is 
particularly justified because his duties con-
cern national security. The Supreme Court 
held in Hurluw v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 
(1982), that senior presidential advisers do

visers, see Immunity of the Assistant to the

Moreover, 
the

seeks 
Mr.

ment. The President has the constitutional

DEAR MR. CIPOLLONE: On November 7, 2019, 
the Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence of the House of Representatives 
issued a subpoena seeking to compel Mick 
Mulvaney, Assistant to the President and 
Acting White House Chief of Staff, to testify 
at a deposition on Friday, November 8. The 
Committee subpoenaed Mr. Mulvaney as part 
of its impeachment inquiry into the conduct 
of the President. See H.R. Res. 660, 116th

Committee may compel him to testify. We 
conclude that Mr. Mulvaney is absolutely 
immune from compelled congressional testi-
mony in his capacity as a senior adviser to 
the President. 
The Executive Branch has taken the posi-
tion for decades that ‘‘Congress may not con-
stitutionally compel the President’s senior 
advisers to testify about their official du-
ties.’’ Testimonial Immunity Before Congress 
ofthe Former Counsel to the President, 43 Op. 
O.L.C. __, at *1 (May 20, 2019). The immunity 
applies to those ‘‘immediate advisers .
.
. 
who customarily meet with the President on 
a regular or frequent basis.’’ Memorandum 
for John D. Ehrlichman, Assistant to the 
President for Domestic Affairs, from William 
H. Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney General, 
Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Power of Congres-
sional Committee to Compel Appearance or Tes-
timony of ‘‘White House Staff’’ at 7 (Feb. 5, 
1971) (‘‘Rehnquist Memorandum’’). We re-
cently advised you that this immunity ap-
plies in an impeachment inquiry just as in a 
legislative oversight inquiry. See Letter for 
Pat A. Cipollone, Counsel to the President, 
from Steven A. Engel, Assistant Attorney 
General, Office of Legal Counsel at 2 (Nov. 3, 
2019). ‘‘Even when impeachment proceedings 
are underway,’’ we explained, ‘‘the President 
must remain able to continue to discharge 
the duties of his office. The testimonial im-
munity of the President’s senior advisers re-
mains an important limitation to protect 
the independence and autonomy ofthe Presi-
dent himself.’’ Id. 
This immunity applies in connection with 
the 
Committee’s 
subpoena 
for 
Mr. 
Mulvaney’s testimony. The Committee in-
tends to question Mr. Mulvaney about mat-
ters related to his official duties at the 
White House—specifically the President’s 
conduct of foreign relations with Ukraine. 
See Letter for Mick Mulvaney from Adam B. 
Schiff, Chairman, House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, et al. (Nov. 5, 
2019). And Mr. Mulvaney, as Acting Chief of 
Staff, is a ‘‘top presidential adviser[],’’ In re 
Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 757 (D.C. Cir. 1997), 
who works closely with the President in su-
pervising the staff within the Executive Of-
fice ofthe President and managing the advice 
the President receives. See David B. Cohen & 
Charles E. Walcott, White House Transition 
Project, Report 2017–21, The Office of Chief of 
Staff l5–26 (2017). Mr. Mulvaney meets with 
and advises the President on a daily basis 
about the most sensitive issues confronting 
the government. Thus, he readily qualifies as 
an ‘‘immediate adviser[]’’ who may not be 
compelled 
to 
testify 
before 
Congress. 
Rehnquist Memorandum at 7. 
This conclusion also follows from this Of-
fice’s prior recognition that certain Deputy 
White House Chiefs of Staff were immune 
from compelled congressional testimony. See 
Letter for Pat A. Cipollone, Counsel to the 
President, from Steven A. Engel, Assistant 
Attorney General, Office ofLegal Counsel 
(Sept. 16, 2019) (former Deputy Chief of Staff 
for Policy Implementation Rick Dearborn); 
Letter for Fred F. Fielding, Counsel to the 
President, from Steven G. Bradbury, Prin-
cipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Of-
fice of Legal Counsel (Aug. 1, 2007) (Deputy 
White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove). In ad-
dition, as we have noted with respect to 
other recently issued subpoenas, testimonial 
immunity is particularly justified because 
the Committee seeks Mr. Mulvaney’s testi-
mony about the President’s conduct of rela-
tions with a foreign government. See, e.g., 
Letter for Pat A. Cipollone, Counsel to the 
President, from Steven A. Engel, Assistant 
Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel at 
2–3 (Oct. 25, 2019); see also Harlow v. Fitz-
gerald, 457 U.S. 800, 812 n.19 (1982) (‘‘[A] deriv-
ative claim to Presidential immunity would 
be strongest in such ‘central’ Presidential 
domains as foreign policy and national secu-
rity, in which the President could not dis-
charge his singularly vital mandate without 
delegating functions nearly as sensitive as 
his own.’’). 
Please let us know if we may be of further 
assistance.

[IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE UNITED 
STATES SENATE] 
TRIAL MEMORANDUM OF PRESIDENT 
DONALD J. TRUMP 
January 20, 2020. 
[In the Senate of the United States Sitting 
as a Court of Impeachment] 
In re Impeachment of President Donald J. 
Trump 
REPLICATION OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES
TO
THE
ANSWER
OF 
PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP TO THE ARTI-
CLES OF IMPEACHMENT 
The House of Representatives, through its 
Managers and counsel, replies to the Answer 
of President Donald J. Trump as follows: 
PREAMBLE 
The House denies each and every allega-
tion and defense in the Preamble to the An-
swer. 
The American people entrusted President 
Trump with the extraordinary powers vested 
in his Office by the Constitution, powers 
which he swore a sacred Oath to use for the 
Nation’s benefit. President Trump broke 
that promise. He used Presidential powers to 
pressure a vulnerable foreign partner to 
interfere in our elections for his own benefit. 
In doing so, he jeopardized our national secu-
rity and our democratic self-governance. He 
then used his Presidential powers to orches-
trate a cover-up unprecedented in the his-
tory of our Republic: a complete and relent-
less blockade of the House’s constitutional 
power to investigate high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors. 
President Trump maintains that the Sen-
ate cannot remove him even if the House 
proves every claim in the Articles of im-
peachment. That is a chilling assertion. It is 
also dead wrong. The Framers deliberately 
drafted a Constitution that allows the Sen-
ate to remove Presidents who, like President 
Trump, abuse their power to cheat in elec-
tions, betray our national security, and ig-
nore checks and balances. That President 
Trump believes otherwise, and insists he is 
free to engage in such conduct again, only 
highlights the continuing threat he poses to 
the Nation if allowed to remain in office. 
Despite President Trump’s stonewalling of 
the 
impeachment 
inquiry, 
the 
House 
amassed overwhelming evidence of his guilt. 
It did so through fair procedures rooted firm-
ly in the Constitution and precedent. It ex-
tended President Trump protections equal 
to, or greater than, those afforded to Presi-
dents in prior impeachment inquiries. To 
prevent President Trump’s obstruction from 
delaying justice until after the very election 
he seeks to corrupt, the House moved deci-
sively to adopt the two Articles of impeach-
ment. Still, new evidence continues to 
emerge, all of which confirms these charges. 
Now it is the Senate’s duty to conduct a 
fair trial—fair for President Trump, and fair 
for the American people. Only if the Senate 
sees and hears all relevant evidence—only if 
it insists upon the whole truth—can it render 
impartial justice. That means the Senate 
should require the President to turn over the 
documents he is hiding. It should hear from 
witnesses, as it has done in every impeach-
ment trial in American history; it especially 
should hear from witnesses the President 
blocked from testifying in the House. Presi-
dent Trump cannot have it both ways. His 
Answer directly disputes key facts. He must 
either surrender all evidence relevant to the 
facts he has disputed or concede the facts as 
charged. Otherwise, this impeachment trial 
will fall far short of the American system of 
justice. 
President Trump asserts that his impeach-
ment is a partisan ‘‘hoax.’’ He is wrong. The 
House duly approved Articles of impeach-
ment because its Members swore Oaths to 
support and defend the Constitution against 
all threats, foreign and domestic. The House 
has fulfilled its constitutional duty. Now, 
Senators must honor their own Oaths by

January 21, 2020 
holding a fair trial with all relevant evi-
dence. The Senate should place truth above 
faction. And it should convict the President 
on both Articles. 
ARTICLE I 
The House denies each and every allega-
tion in the Answer to Article I that denies 
the acts, knowledge, intent, or wrongful con-
duct charged against President Trump. The 
House states that each and every allegation 
in Article I is true, and that any affirmative 
defenses set forth in the Answer to Article I 
are wholly without merit. The House further 
states that Article I properly alleges an im-
peachable offense under the Constitution, is 
not subject to a motion to dismiss, and 
should be considered and adjudicated by the 
Senate sitting as a Court of Impeachment. 
Article I charges President Trump with 
Abuse of Power. The President solicited and 
pressured a foreign nation, Ukraine, to help 
him cheat in the next Presidential election 
by announcing two investigations: the first 
into an American citizen who was also a po-
litical opponent of his; the second into a 
baseless conspiracy theory promoted by Rus-
sia that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in 
the 2016 election. President Trump sought to 
coerce Ukraine into making these announce-
ments by withholding two official acts: the 
release of desperately needed military aid 
and a vital White House meeting. There is 
overwhelming evidence of the charges in Ar-
ticle I, as set forth in the 111-page brief and 
statement of material facts that the House 
submitted on January 18, 2020. 
In his Answer, the President describes 
‘‘several simple facts’’ that prove he ‘‘did 
nothing wrong.’’ This is false. President 
Trump cites the record of his July 25, 2019 
phone 
call 
with 
President 
Volodymyr 
Zelensky of Ukraine. But we have read the 
transcript and it confirms his guilt. It shows, 
first and foremost, that he solicited a foreign 
power to announce two politically motivated 
investigations that would benefit him per-
sonally. It also indicates that he linked 
these investigations to the release of mili-
tary assistance: on the call, he responded to 
President Zelensky’s inquiries about U.S. 
military support by pressing him to ‘‘do us a 
favor though’’ and pursue President Trump’s 
desired political investigations. Astound-
ingly, the Answer claims that President 
Trump raised the issue of ‘‘corruption’’ dur-
ing the July 25 call, but that word appears 
nowhere in the record of the call, despite the 
urging of his national security staff. In fact, 
President Trump did not care at all about 
Ukraine; he only cared about the ‘‘big stuff’’ 
that affected him personally, specifically the 
Biden investigation. 
President Trump also points to statements 
by ‘‘President Zelensky and other Ukrainian 
officials’’ denying any impropriety. Yet 
there is clear proof that Ukrainian officials 
felt pressured by President Trump and 
grasped the corrupt nature of his scheme. 
For example, a Ukrainian national security 
advisor stated that President Zelensky ‘‘is 
sensitive about Ukraine being taken seri-
ously, not merely as an instrument in Wash-
ington domestic, reelection politics.’’ As ex-
perts testified in the House, President 
Zelensky remains critically dependent on 
continued United States military and diplo-
matic support. He has powerful incentives to 
avoid angering President Trump. 
President Trump places great weight on 
two of his own statements denying a quid pro 
quo. These are hardly convincing. One denial 
the President blurted out, unprompted, to 
Ambassador Gordon Sondland, but only after 
the White House had learned about a whis-
tleblower complaint and the Washington 
Post had reported the President’s corrupt 
scheme—in other words, after President 
Trump got caught. President Trump then de-
manded 
to 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
that 
Ukraine execute the very this-for-that cor-
rupt exchange that is alleged in Article I. As 
to the second denial cited in the Answer, 
President Trump made this statement to 
Senator Ron Johnson also after having 
learned of the whistleblower complaint, 
while inexplicably refusing the Senator’s ur-
gent plea to release the military aid. In any 
event, these self-serving false statements are 
contradicted by all of the other evidence. 
They show a cover-up and consciousness of 
guilt, not a credible defense for the Presi-
dent. 
Lastly, the President notes that he met 
with President Zelensky at the U.N. General 
Assembly and released the aid without 
Ukraine announcing the investigations. But 
he did so only after he was caught red-hand-
ed. And he still has not met with President 
Zelensky at the White House, which Ukraine 
has long sought to demonstrate United 
States support in the face of Russian aggres-
sion. 
The Answer offers an unconvincing and im-
plausible defense against the factual allega-
tions in Article I. The ‘‘simple facts’’ that it 
recites confirm President Trump’s guilt, not 
his innocence. Moreover, fairness demands 
that if the President wants to put the facts 
at issue, he must end his cover-up and pro-
vide the Senate with all of the relevant docu-
ments and testimony. He cannot deny facts 
established by overwhelming evidence while 
concealing additional relevant evidence. 
The President also asserts that Article I 
does not state an impeachable offense. In his 
view, the American people are powerless to 
remove a President for corruptly using his 
Office to cheat in the next election by solic-
iting and coercing a foreign power to sabo-
tage a rival and spread conspiracy theories 
helpful to the President. This is the argu-
ment of a monarch, with no basis in the Con-
stitution. 
Abuse of Power is an impeachable offense. 
The Framers made this clear, including 
Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, James 
Iredell, and Edmund Randolph. The Supreme 
Court has recognized as much, as did the 
House Judiciary Committee in President 
Richard Nixon’s case. 
When the Framers wrote the Impeachment 
Clause, they aimed it squarely at abuse of of-
fice for personal gain, betrayal of the na-
tional interest through foreign entangle-
ments, and corruption of elections. President 
Trump has engaged in the trifecta of con-
stitutional misconduct warranting removal. 
He is the Framers’ worst nightmare come to 
life. 
ARTICLE II 
The House denies each and every allega-
tion in the Answer to Article II that denies 
the acts, knowledge, intent, or wrongful con-
duct charged against President Trump. The 
House further states that each and every al-
legation in Article II is true, and that any 
affirmative defenses set forth in the Answer 
to Article II are wholly without merit. The 
House further states that Article II properly 
alleges an impeachable offense under the 
Constitution, is not subject to a motion to 
dismiss, and should be considered and adju-
dicated by the Senate sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment. 
Article II charges President Trump with 
directing the categorical and indiscriminate 
defiance of every single subpoena served by 
the House in its impeachment inquiry. No 
President or other official in the history of 
the Republic has ever ordered others to defy 
an impeachment subpoena; Presidents An-
drew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clin-
ton all allowed their most senior advisors to 
give testimony to Congressional investiga-
tors. Nor has any President or other official 
himself defied such a subpoena—except for 
President Nixon, who, like President Trump, 
faced an article of impeachment for Obstruc-
tion of Congress. Instead, Presidents have 
recognized that Congressional power is at its 
apex in an impeachment. As President James 
Polk stated: the ‘‘power of the House’’ in 
cases of impeachment ‘‘would penetrate into 
the most secret recesses of the Executive De-
partments.’’ 
President Trump’s defenses are wrong. At 
his personal direction, nine officials refused 
subpoenas to testify and the White House, 
Office of Management and Budget, and De-
partments of State, Defense, and Energy all 
defied valid subpoenas for documents. The 
fact that President Trump caved to public 
pressure and released two call transcripts— 
which, in fact, expose his guilt—hardly 
amounts to ‘‘transparency’’ and does not 
mitigate his obstruction. 
Nor is President Trump’s Obstruction of 
Congress excused by his incorrect legal argu-
ments. 
First, the impeachment inquiry was prop-
erly authorized and Congressional subpoenas 
do not require a vote of the full House. 
Second, President Trump’s blanket and cat-
egorical defiance of the House stemmed from 
his unilateral decision not to ‘‘participate’’ 
in the impeachment investigation, not from 
any legal assertion. 
Third, President Trump never actually as-
serted executive privilege, a limited doctrine 
that has never been accepted as a basis for 
defying impeachment subpoenas. The foreign 
affairs and national security setting of this 
impeachment does not require a different re-
sult here; it makes the President’s obstruc-
tion all the more alarming. The Framers ex-
plicitly stated that betrayal involving for-
eign powers is a core impeachable offense. It 
follows that the House is empowered to in-
vestigate such abuses, as all 17 current and 
former Executive Branch officials who testi-
fied about these matters recognized. 
Fourth, the President’s invocation of ‘‘ab-
solute immunity’’ fails because this fictional 
doctrine has been rejected by every court to 
consider it in similar circumstances; Presi-
dent Trump extended it far beyond any un-
derstanding by prior Presidents; and it offers 
no explanation for his across-the-board re-
fusal to turn over every single document 
subpoenaed. 
Finally, the President’s lawyers have ar-
gued in court that it is constitutionally for-
bidden for the House to seek judicial enforce-
ment of its subpoenas, even as they now 
argue in the Senate that the House is re-
quired to seek such enforcement. Again, 
President Trump would have it both ways: 
he argues simultaneously that the House 
must use the courts and that it is prohibited 
from using the courts. This duplicity is poor 
camouflage for the weakness of President 
Trump’s 
legal 
arguments. 
More 
signifi-
cantly, 
any 
judicial 
enforcement 
effort 
would have taken years to pursue. In grant-
ing the House the ‘‘sole Power of Impeach-
ment,’’ along with the power to investigate 
grounds for impeachment, the Framers did 
not require the House to exhaust all alter-
native methods of obtaining evidence, espe-
cially when those alternatives would fail to 
deal with an immediate threat. To protect 
the Nation, the House had to act swiftly in 
addressing the clear and present danger 
posed by President Trump’s misconduct. 
President Trump engaged in a cover-up 
that itself establishes his consciousness of 
guilt. Innocent people seek to bring the 
truth to light. In contrast, President Trump 
has acted in the way that guilty people do 
when they are caught and fear the facts. But 
the stakes here are even higher than that. In 
completely obstructing an investigation into

his own misconduct, President Trump as-
serted the prerogative to nullify Congress’s 
impeachment power itself. He placed himself 
above the law and eviscerated the separation 
of powers. This claim evokes monarchy and 
despotism. It has no place in our democracy, 
where even the highest official must answer 
to Congress and the Constitution. 
CONCLUSION 
The House denies each and every allega-
tion and defense in the Conclusion to the An-
swer. 
President Trump did not engage in this 
corrupt conduct to uphold the Presidency or 
protect the right to vote. He did it to cheat 
in the next election and bury the evidence 
when he got caught. He has acted in ways 
that prior Presidents expressly disavowed, 
while injuring our national security and de-
mocracy. And he will persist in that mis-
conduct—which he deems ‘‘perfect’’—unless 
and until he is removed from office. The Sen-
ate should do so following a fair trial.

REPLY MEMORANDUM OF THE UNITED STATES 
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES
IN
THE
IM-
PEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD J. 
TRUMP 
INTRODUCTION 
President Trump’s brief confirms that his 
misconduct is indefensible. To obtain a per-
sonal political ‘‘favor’’ designed to weaken a 
political rival, President Trump corruptly 
pressured the newly elected Ukrainian Presi-
dent into announcing two sham investiga-
tions. As leverage against Ukraine in his cor-
rupt scheme, President Trump illegally 
withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in 
security assistance critical to Ukraine’s de-
fense against Russian aggression, as well as 
a vital Oval Office meeting. When he got 
caught, President Trump sought to cover up 
his scheme by ordering his Administration 
to disclose no information to the House of 
Representatives in its impeachment inves-
tigation. President Trump’s efforts to hide 
his misdeeds continue to this day, as do his 
efforts to solicit foreign interference. Presi-
dent Trump must be removed from office 
now because he is trying to cheat his way to 
victory in the 2020 Presidential election, and 
thereby undermine the very foundation of 
our democratic system. 
President Trump’s lengthy brief to the 
Senate is heavy on rhetoric and procedural 
grievances, but entirely lacks a legitimate 
defense of his misconduct. It is clear from 
his response that President Trump would 
rather discuss anything other than what he 
actually did. Indeed, the first 80 pages of his 
brief do not meaningfully attempt to defend 
his conduct—because there is no defense for 
a President who seeks foreign election inter-
ference to retain power and then attempts to 
cover it up by obstructing a Congressional 
inquiry. The Senate should swiftly reject 
President 
Trump’s 
bluster 
and 
evasion, 
which amount to the frightening assertion 
that he may commit whatever misconduct 
he wishes, at whatever cost to the Nation, 
and then hide his actions from the represent-
atives of the American people without reper-
cussion. 
First, President Trump’s argument that 
abuse of power is not an impeachable offense 
is wrong—and dangerous. That argument 
would mean that, even accepting that the 
House’s recitation of the facts is correct— 
which it is—the House lacks authority to re-
move a President who sells out our democ-
racy and national security in exchange for a 
personal political favor. The Framers of our 
Constitution took pains to ensure that such 
egregious abuses of power would be impeach-
able. They specifically rejected a proposal to 
limit impeachable offenses to treason and 
bribery and included the term ‘‘other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 1 
There can be no reasonable dispute that 
the Framers would have considered a Presi-
dent’s solicitation of a foreign country’s 
election interference in exchange for critical 
American military and diplomatic support 
to be an impeachable offense. Nor can there 
be any dispute that the Framers would have 
recognized that allowing a President to pre-
vent Congress from investigating his mis-
conduct would nullify the House’s ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment.’’ 2
No amount of 
legal rhetoric can hide the fact that Presi-
dent Trump exemplifies why the Framers in-
cluded the impeachment mechanism in the 
Constitution: to save the American people 
from these kinds of threats to our republic. 
Second, President Trump’s assertion that 
impeachable offenses must involve criminal 
conduct is refuted by two centuries of prece-
dent and, if accepted, would have intolerable 
consequences. But this argument has not 
been accepted in previous impeachment pro-
ceedings and should not be accepted here. As 
one member of President Trump’s legal team 
previously conceded, President Trump’s the-
ory would mean that the President could not 
be impeached even if he allowed an enemy 
power to invade and conquer American terri-
tory.3 The absurdity of that argument dem-
onstrates why every serious constitutional 
scholar to consider it—including the House 
Republicans’ own legal expert—has rejected 
it.4 The Framers intentionally did not tie 
‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ to the fed-
eral criminal code—which did not exist at 
the time of the Founding—but instead cre-
ated impeachment to cover severe abuses of 
the public trust like those of President 
Trump. 
Third, President Trump now claims that he 
had virtuous reasons for withholding from 
our ally Ukraine sorely needed security as-
sistance and that there was no actual threat 
or reward as part of his proposed corrupt 
bargain. But the President’s after-the-fact 
justifications for his illegal hold on security 
assistance cannot fool anybody. The reason 
President Trump jeopardized U.S. national 
security and the integrity of our elections is 
even more pernicious: he wanted leverage 
over Ukraine to obtain a personal, political 
favor that he hoped would bolster his reelec-
tion bid. 
If withholding the security assistance to 
Ukraine had been a legitimate foreign policy 
act, then there is no reason President 
Trump’s staff would have gone to such 
lengths to hide it, and no reason President 
Trump would have tried so hard to deny the 
obvious when it came to light. It is common 
sense that innocent people do not behave 
like President Trump did here. As his own 
Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney bluntly 
confessed and as numerous other witnesses 
confirmed, there was indeed a quid pro quo 
with Ukraine. The Trump Administration’s 
message to the American people was clear: 
‘‘We do that all the time with foreign pol-
icy.’’ 5 Instead of embracing what his Acting 
Chief of Staff honestly disclosed, President 
Trump has tried to hide what the evidence 
plainly reveals: the Emperor has no clothes. 
Fourth, President Trump’s assertion that 
he has acted with ‘‘transparency’’ during 
this impeachment is yet another falsehood. 
In fact, unlike any of his predecessors, Presi-
dent Trump categorically refused to provide 
the House with any information and de-
manded that the entire Executive Branch 
coverup his misconduct. President Trump’s 
subordinates fell in line. 
Similarly wrong is the argument by Presi-
dent Trump’s lawyers that his blanket claim 
of immunity from investigation should now 
be understood as a valid assertion of execu-
tive privilege—a privilege he never actually 
invoked. And President Trump’s continued 
attempt to justify his obstruction by citing 
to constitutional separation of powers mis-
understands the nature of an impeachment. 
His across-the-board refusal to provide Con-
gress with information and his assertion 
that his own lawyers are the sole judges of 
Presidential privilege undermines the con-
stitutional authority of the people’s rep-
resentatives and shifts power to an imperial 
President. 
Fifth, President Trump’s complaints about 
the House’s impeachment procedures are 
meritless excuses. President Trump was of-
fered an eminently fair process by the House 
and he will receive additional process during 
the Senate proceedings, which, unlike the 
House investigation, constitute an actual 
trial. As President Trump recognizes, the 
Senate must ‘‘decide for itself all matters of 
law and fact.’’ 6 
The House provided President Trump with 
process that was just as substantial—if not 
more so—than the process afforded other 
Presidents who have been subject to an im-
peachment inquiry, including the right to 
call witnesses and present evidence. Because 
he had too much to hide, President Trump 
did not take advantage of what the House of-
fered him and instead decided to shout from 
the sidelines—only to claim that the process 
he obstructed was unfair. President Trump’s 
lengthy trial brief does not explain why, 
even now, he has not offered any documents 
or witnesses in his defense or provided any 
information in response to the House’s re-
peated requests. This is not how an innocent 
person behaves. President Trump’s process 
arguments are simply part of his attempt to 
cover up his wrongdoing and to undermine 
the House in the exercise of its constitu-
tional duty. 
Finally, President Trump’s impeachment 
trial is an effort to safeguard our elections, 
not override them. His unsupported conten-
tions to the contrary have it exactly back-
wards. President Trump has shown that he 
will use the immense powers of his office to 
manipulate the upcoming election to his own 
advantage. Respect for the integrity of this 
Nation’s democratic process requires that 
President Trump be removed before he can 
corrupt the very election that would hold 
him accountable to the American people. 
In addition, President Trump is wrong to 
suggest that the impeachment trial is an at-
tempt to overturn the prior election. If the 
Senate 
convicts 
and 
removes 
President 
Trump from office, then the Vice President 
elected by the American people in 2016 will 
become the President.7 The logic of Presi-
dent Trump’s argument is that because he 
was elected once and stands for reelection 
again, he cannot be impeached no matter 
how egregiously he betrays his oath of office. 
This type of argument would not have fooled 
the Framers of our Constitution, who in-
cluded impeachment as a check on Presi-
dents who would abuse their office for per-
sonal gain, like President Trump. 
The Framers anticipated that a President 
might one day seek to place his own personal

and political interests above those of our Na-
tion, and they understood that foreign inter-
ference in our elections was one of the 
gravest threats to our democracy. The Fram-
ers also knew that periodic democratic elec-
tions cannot serve as an effective check on a 
President who seeks to manipulate the those 
elections. The ultimate check on Presi-
dential misconduct was provided by the 
Framers through the power to impeach and 
remove a President—a power that the Fram-
ers vested in the representatives of the 
American people. 
Indeed, on the eve of his impeachment 
trial, President Trump continues to insist 
that he has done nothing wrong. President 
Trump’s view that he cannot be held ac-
countable, except in an election he seeks to 
fix in his favor, underscores the need for the 
Senate to exercise its solemn constitutional 
duty to remove President Trump from office. 
If the Senate does not convict and remove 
President Trump, he will have succeeded in 
placing himself above the law. Each Senator 
should set aside partisanship and politics 
and hold President Trump accountable to 
protect our national security and democ-
racy. 
ARGUMENT 
I. President Trump must be Removed for Abus-
ing his Power 
A. President Trump’s Abuse of Power Is a 
Quintessential Impeachable Offense 
President Trump contends that he can 
abuse his power with impunity—in his words, 
‘‘do whatever I want as President’’ 8—pro-
vided he does not technically violate a stat-
ute in the process. That argument is both 
wrong and remarkable. History, precedent, 
and the words of the Framers conclusively 
establish that serious abuses of power—of-
fenses, like President Trump’s, that threaten 
our democratic system—are impeachable. 
President Trump’s own misconduct illus-
trates the implications of his position. In 
President Trump’s view, as long as he does 
not violate a specific statute, then the only 
check on his corrupt abuse of his office for 
his personal gain is the need to face reelec-
tion—even if the very goal of his abusive be-
havior is to cheat in that election. If Presi-
dent Trump were to succeed in his scheme 
and win a second and final term, he would 
face no check on his conduct. The Senate 
should reject that dangerous position. 
1. The Framers Intended Impeachment as a 
Remedy for Abuse of High Office. President 
Trump appears to reluctantly concede that 
the fear that Presidents would abuse their 
power was among the key reasons that the 
Framers adopted an impeachment remedy.9 
But he contends that abuse of power was 
never intended to be an impeachable offense 
in its own right.10 
President Trump’s focus on the label to be 
applied to his conduct distracts from the 
fundamental point: His conduct is impeach-
able whether it is called an ‘‘abuse of power’’ 
or something else. The Senate is not engaged 
in an abstract debate about how to cat-
egorize the particular acts at issue; the ques-
tion instead is whether President Trump’s 
conduct is impeachable because it is a seri-
ous threat to our republic. For the reasons 
set forth in the House Manager’s opening 
brief, the answer is plainly yes. 
In any event, President Trump is wrong 
that abuses of power are not impeachable. 
The Framers focused on the toxic combina-
tion of corruption and foreign interference— 
what George Washington in his Farewell Ad-
dress called ‘‘one of the most baneful foes of 
republican government.’’ 11 James Madison 
put it simply: The President ‘‘might betray 
his trust to foreign powers.’’ 12 
To the Framers, such an abuse of power 
was the quintessential impeachable conduct. 
They therefore rejected a proposal to limit 
impeachable offenses to only treason and 
bribery. They recognized the peril of setting 
a rigid standard for impeachment, and adopt-
ed terminology that would encompass what 
George Mason termed the many ‘‘great and 
dangerous offenses’’ that might ‘‘subvert the 
Constitution.’’ 13 The Framers considered and 
rejected as too narrow the word ‘‘corrup-
tion,’’ deciding instead on the term ‘‘high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ because it would 
encompass the type of ‘‘abuse or violation of 
some public trust’’—the abuse of power— 
that President Trump committed here.14 
2. Impeachable Conduct Need Not Violate Es-
tablished Law. President Trump argues that a 
President’s conduct is impeachable only if it 
violates a ‘‘known offense defined in existing 
law.’’ 15 That contention conflicts with con-
stitutional text, Congressional precedents, 
and the overwhelming consensus of constitu-
tional scholars. 
The Framers borrowed the term ‘‘high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ from British 
practice and state constitutions. As that 
term was applied in England, officials had 
long been impeached for non-statutory of-
fenses, such as the failure to spend money al-
located by Parliament, disobeying an order 
of Parliament, and appointing unfit subordi-
nates.16 The British understood impeachable 
offenses to be ‘‘so various in their character, 
and so indefinable in their actual involu-
tions, that it is almost impossible to provide 
systematically for them by positive law.’’ 17 
American precedent confirms that the Im-
peachment Clause is not confined to a statu-
tory code. The articles of impeachment 
against President Nixon turned on his abuse 
of power, rather than on his commission of a 
statutory offense. Many of the specific alle-
gations set forth in those three articles did 
not involve any crimes. Instead, the House 
Judiciary Committee emphasized that Presi-
dent Nixon’s conduct was ‘‘undertaken for 
his own personal political advantage and not 
in furtherance of any valid national policy 
objective’’ 18—and expressly stated that his 
abuses of power warranted removal regard-
less whether they violated a specific stat-
ute.19 
Previous impeachments were in accord. In 
1912, for example, Judge Archibald was im-
peached and convicted for using his position 
to generate business deals with potential 
litigants in his court, even though this be-
havior had not been shown to violate any 
then-existing statute or laws regulating 
judges. The House Manager in the Archibald 
impeachment asserted that ‘‘[t]he decisions 
of the Senate of the United States, of the 
various State tribunals which have jurisdic-
tion over impeachment cases, and of the Par-
liament of England all agree that an offense, 
in order to be impeachable, need not be in-
dictable either at common law or under any 
statute.’’ 20 As early as 1803, Judge Pickering 
was impeached and then removed from office 
by the Senate for refusing to allow an ap-
peal, declining to hear witnesses, and appear-
ing on the bench while intoxicated and 
thereby ‘‘degrading the honor and dignity of 
the United States.’’ 21 
President Trump’s argument conflicts with 
a long history of scholarly consensus, includ-
ing among ‘‘some of the most distinguished 
members of the [Constitutional] conven-
tion.’’ 22 As a leading early treatise on the 
Constitution explained, impeachable offenses 
‘‘are not necessarily offences against the 
general laws . . . [for] [i]t is often found that 
offences of a very serious nature by high offi-
cers are not offences against the criminal 
code, but consist in abuses or betrayals of 
trust, or inexcusable neglects of duty.’’ 23 In 
his influential 1833 treatise, Supreme Court 
Justice Joseph Story similarly explained 
that impeachment encompasses ‘‘misdeeds 
. . . as peculiarly injure the commonwealth 
by the abuse of high offices of trust,’’ wheth-
er or not those misdeeds violate existing 
statutes intended for other circumstances.24 
Story observed that the focus was not 
‘‘crimes of a strictly legal character,’’ but 
instead ‘‘what are aptly termed, political 
offences, growing out of personal mis-
conduct, or gross neglect, or usurpation, or 
habitual disregard of the public interests, in 
the discharge of the duties of political of-
fice.’’ 25 
The fact that impeachment is not limited 
to violations of ‘‘established law’’ reflects its 
basic function as a remedy reserved for of-
fice-holders who occupy special positions of 
trust and power. Statutes of general applica-
bility do not address the ways in which those 
to whom impeachment applies may abuse 
their unique positions. Limiting impeach-
ment only to those statutes would defeat its 
basic purpose. 
Modern 
constitutional 
scholars 
over-
whelmingly agree. That includes one of 
President Trump’s own attorneys, who ar-
gued during President Clinton’s impeach-
ment: ‘‘It certainly doesn’t have to be a 
crime, if you have somebody who completely 
corrupts the office of president, and who 
abuses trust and who poses great danger to 
our liberty.’’ 26 More recently, that attorney 
changed positions and now maintains that a 
President cannot be impeached even for al-
lowing a foreign sovereign to conquer an 
American State.27 The absurdity of that ar-
gument helps explain why it has been so uni-
formly rejected. 
Even if President Trump were correct that 
the Impeachment Clause covers only conduct 
that violates established law, his argument 
would fail. President Trump concedes that 
‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors’’ encom-
passes conduct that is akin to the terms that 
precede it in the Constitution—treason and 
bribery.28 And there can be no reasonable 
dispute that his misconduct is closely akin 
to bribery. ‘‘The corrupt exercise of power in 
exchange for a personal benefit defines im-
peachable bribery.’’ 29 Here, President Trump 
conditioned his performance of a required 
duty (disbursement of Congressionally ap-
propriated aid funds to Ukraine) on the re-
ceipt of a personal benefit (the announce-
ment of investigations designed to skew the 
upcoming election in his favor). This con-
duct carries all the essential qualities of 
bribery under common law and early Amer-
ican precedents familiar to the Framers.30 It 
would be all the more wrong in their view be-
cause it involves a solicitation to a foreign 
government to manipulate our democratic 
process. And President Trump did actually 
violate an ‘‘established law’’: the Impound-
ment Control Act.31 Thus, even under his 
own standard, President Trump’s conduct is 
impeachable. 
3. Corrupt Intent May Render Conduct an Im-
peachable Abuse of Power. President Trump 
next contends that the Impeachment Clause 
does not encompass any abuse of power that 
turns on the President’s reasons for acting. 
Thus, according to President Trump, if he 
could perform an act for legitimate reasons, 
then he necessarily could perform the same 
act for corrupt reasons.32 That argument is 
obviously wrong. 
The Impeachment Clause itself forecloses 
President Trump’s argument. The specific 
offenses enumerated in that Clause—bribery 
and treason—both turn on the subjective in-
tent of the actor. Treason requires a ‘‘dis-
loyal mind’’ and bribery requires corrupt in-
tent.33 Thus, a President may form a mili-
tary alliance with a foreign nation because 
he believes that doing so is in the Nation’s 
strategic interests, but if the President 
forms that same alliance for the purpose of 
taking up arms and overthrowing the Con-
gress, his conduct is treasonous. Bribery

turns on similar considerations of corrupt 
intent. And, contrary to President Trump’s 
assertion, past impeachments have con-
cerned ‘‘permissible conduct that had been 
simply done with the wrong subjective mo-
tives.’’ 34 The first and second articles of im-
peachment against President Nixon, for ex-
ample, charged him with using the powers of 
his office with the impermissible goals of ob-
structing justice and targeting his political 
opponents—in other words, for exercising 
Presidential power based on impermissible 
reasons.35 
There are many acts that a President has 
‘‘objective’’ authority to perform that would 
constitute grave abuses of power if done for 
corrupt reasons. A President may issue a 
pardon because the applicant demonstrates 
remorse and meets the standards for clem-
ency, but if a President issued a pardon in 
order to prevent a witness from testifying 
against him, or in exchange for campaign do-
nations, or for other corrupt motives, his 
conduct would be impeachable—as our Su-
preme Court unanimously recognized nearly 
a century ago.36 The same principle applies 
here. 
B. The House Has Proven that President 
Trump Corruptly Pressured Ukraine to 
Interfere in the Presidential Election for 
His Personal Benefit 
President Trump withheld hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in military aid and an impor-
tant Oval Office meeting from Ukraine, a 
vulnerable American ally, in a scheme to ex-
tort the Ukrainian government into an-
nouncing investigations that would help 
President Trump and smear a potential rival 
in the upcoming U.S. Presidential election. 
He has not come close to justifying that mis-
conduct. 
1. President Trump principally maintains 
that he did not in fact condition the military 
aid and Oval Office meeting on Ukraine’s an-
nouncement of the investigations—repeat-
edly asserting that there was ‘‘no quid pro 
quo.’’ 37 The overwhelming weight of the evi-
dence refutes that assertion. And President 
Trump has effectively muzzled witnesses who 
could shed additional light on the facts. 
Although President Trump argues that he 
‘‘did not make any connection between the 
assistance and any investigation,’’ 38 his own 
Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, ad-
mitted the opposite during a press con-
ference—conceding that the investigation 
into Ukrainian election interference was 
part of ‘‘why we held up the money.’’ 39 After 
a reporter inquired about this concession of 
a quid pro quo, Mr. Mulvaney replied, ‘‘[W]e 
do that all the time with foreign policy,’’ 
added, ‘‘get over it,’’ and then refused to ex-
plain these statements by testifying in re-
sponse to a House subpoena.40 The Presi-
dent’s brief does not even address Mr. 
Mulvaney’s admission. Ambassador Taylor 
also acknowledged the quid pro quo, stating, 
‘‘I think it’s crazy to withhold security as-
sistance for help with a political cam-
paign.’’ 41 And Ambassador Sondland testi-
fied that the existence of a quid pro quo re-
garding the security assistance was as clear 
as ‘‘two plus two equals four.’’ 42 President 
Trump’s lawyers also avoid responding to 
these statements. 
The same is true of the long-sought Oval 
Office meeting. As Ambassador Sondland 
testified: ‘‘I know that members of this com-
mittee frequently frame these complicated 
issues in the form of a simple question: Was 
there a quid pro quo?’’ He answered that, 
‘‘with regard to the requested White House 
call and the White House meeting, the an-
swer is yes.’’ 43
Ambassador Taylor re-
affirmed the existence of a quid pro quo re-
garding the Oval Office meeting, testifying 
that ‘‘the meeting President Zelensky want-
ed was conditioned on the investigations of 
Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference 
in the 2016 U.S. elections.’’ 44 Other witnesses 
testified similarly.45 
President Trump’s principal answer to this 
evidence is to point to two conversations in 
which he declared to Ambassador Sondland 
and Senator Ron Johnson that there was ‘‘no 
quid pro quo.’’ 46 Both conversations occurred 
after the President had been informed of the 
whistleblower complaint against him, at 
which point he obviously had a strong mo-
tive to come up with seemingly innocent 
cover stories for his misconduct. 
In addition, President Trump’s brief omits 
the second half of what he told Ambassador 
Sondland during their call. Immediately 
after declaring that there was ‘‘no quid pro 
quo,’’ the President insisted that ‘‘President 
Zelensky must announce the opening of the 
investigations and he should want to do 
it.’’ 47 President Trump thus conveyed that 
President Zelensky ‘‘must’’ announce the 
sham investigations in exchange for Amer-
ican support—the very definition of a quid 
pro quo, notwithstanding President Trump’s 
self-serving, false statement to the contrary. 
Indeed that statement shows his conscious-
ness of guilt. 
President Trump also asserts that there 
cannot have been a quid pro quo because 
President Zelensky and other Ukrainian offi-
cials have denied that President Trump 
acted improperly.48 But the evidence shows 
that Ukrainian officials understood that 
they were being used ‘‘as a pawn in a U.S. re-
election campaign.’’ 49 It is hardly surprising 
that President Zelensky has publicly denied 
the existence of a quid pro quo given that 
Ukraine remains critically dependent on 
continued U.S. military and diplomatic sup-
port, and given that President Zelensky ac-
cordingly has a powerful incentive to avoid 
angering 
an 
already 
troubled 
President 
Trump. 
President Trump’s assertion that the evi-
dence of a quid pro quo cannot be trusted be-
cause it is ‘‘hearsay’’ is incorrect.50
The 
White House’s readout of the July 25 phone 
call itself establishes that President Trump 
linked military assistance on President 
Zelensky’s willingness to do him a ‘‘favor’’— 
which President Trump made clear was to 
investigate former Vice President Biden and 
alleged Ukrainian election interference.51 
One of the people who spoke directly to 
President 
Trump—and 
whose 
testimony 
therefore was not hearsay—was Ambassador 
Sondland, who confirmed the existence of a 
quid pro quo and provided some of the most 
damning 
testimony 
against 
President 
Trump.52 Other witnesses provided compel-
ling corroborating evidence of the Presi-
dent’s scheme.53 
President Trump’s denials of the quid pro 
quo are, therefore, plainly false. There is a 
term for this type of self-serving denial in 
criminal 
cases—a 
‘‘false 
exculpatory’’— 
which is strong evidence of guilt.54 When a 
defendant ‘‘intentionally offers an expla-
nation, or makes some statement tending to 
show his innocence, and this explanation or 
statement is later shown to be false,’’ such a 
false statement tends to show the defend-
ant’s consciousness of guilt.55
President 
Trump’s denial of the quid pro quo under-
scores that he knows his scheme to procure 
the sham investigations was improper, and 
that he is now lying to cover it up. 
2. President Trump next argues that he 
withheld 
urgently 
needed 
support 
for 
Ukraine for reasons unrelated to his political 
interest.56 But President Trump’s asserted 
reasons for withholding the military aid and 
Oval Office meeting are implausible on their 
face.57 
President Trump never attempted to jus-
tify the decision to withhold the military aid 
and Oval Office meeting on foreign policy 
grounds when it was underway. To the con-
trary, 
President 
Trump’s 
lawyer 
Rudy 
Giuliani acknowledged about his Ukraine 
work that ‘‘this isn’t foreign policy.’’ 58 
President Trump sought to hide the scheme 
from the public and refused to give any ex-
planation for it even within the U.S. govern-
ment. He persisted in the scheme after his 
own 
Defense 
Department 
warned—cor-
rectly—that withholding military aid appro-
priated by Congress would violate federal 
law, and after his National Security Advisor 
likened the arrangement to a ‘‘drug deal.’’ 59 
And he released the military aid shortly 
after 
Congress 
announced 
an 
investiga-
tion 60—in other words, after he got caught. 
The various explanations that President 
Trump now presses are after-the-fact pre-
texts that cannot be reconciled with his ac-
tual conduct.61 
The Anti-Corruption Pretext. The evidence 
shows that President Trump was actually in-
different to corruption in Ukraine before 
Vice President Biden became a candidate for 
President. After Biden’s candidacy was an-
nounced, President Trump remained uninter-
ested in anti-corruption measures in Ukraine 
beyond announcements of two sham inves-
tigations that would help him personally.62 
In fact, he praised a corrupt prosecutor and 
recalled a U.S. Ambassador known for her 
anti-corruption efforts. President Trump did 
not seek investigations into alleged corrup-
tion—as one would expect if anti-corruption 
were his goal—but instead sought only an-
nouncements 
of 
investigations—because 
those announcements are what would help 
him politically. 
As Ambassador Sondland testified, Presi-
dent Trump ‘‘did not give a [expletive] about 
Ukraine,’’ and instead cared only about ‘‘big 
stuff’’ that benefitted him personally like 
‘‘the Biden investigation.’’ 63 While President 
Trump asserts that he released the aid in re-
sponse to Ukraine’s actual progress on cor-
ruption,64 in fact he released the aid two 
days after Congress announced an investiga-
tion into his misconduct. And President 
Trump’s claim that the removal of the 
former Ukrainian prosecutor general encour-
aged him to release the aid is astonishing.65 
On the July 25 call with President Zelensky, 
President Trump praised that very same 
prosecutor—and Mr. Giuliani continues to 
meet with that prosecutor to try to dig up 
dirt on Vice President Biden to this day.66 
The 
Burden-Sharing 
Pretext. 
Until 
his 
scheme was exposed, President Trump never 
attempted to attribute his hold on military 
aid to a concern about other countries not 
sharing the burden of supporting Ukraine.67 
One reason he never attempted to justify the 
hold on these grounds is that it is not 
grounded in reality. Other countries in fact 
contribute substantially to Ukraine. Since 
2014, the European Union and European fi-
nancial institutions have committed over $16 
billion to Ukraine.68 
In addition, President Trump never even 
asked European countries to increase their 
contributions to Ukraine as a condition for 
releasing the assistance. He released the as-
sistance even though European countries did 
not change their contributions. President 
Trump’s asserted concern about burden-shar-
ing is impossible to credit given that he kept 
his own Administration in the dark about 
the issue for months, never made any con-
temporaneous public statements about it, 
never asked Europe to increase its contribu-
tion,69
and released the aid without any 
change in Europe’s contribution only two 
days after an investigation into his scheme 
commenced.70 
The Burisma Pretext. The conspiracy theory 
regarding Vice President Biden and Burisma 
is baseless. There is no credible evidence to

support the allegation that Vice President 
Biden encouraged Ukraine to remove one of 
its prosecutors in an improper effort to pro-
tect his son. To the contrary, Biden was car-
rying out official U.S. policy—with bipar-
tisan support—when he sought that prosecu-
tor’s ouster because the prosecutor was 
known to be corrupt.71 In any event, the 
prosecutor’s removal made it more likely that 
Ukraine would investigate Burisma, not less 
likely—a fact that President Trump does not 
attempt to dispute. The allegations against 
Biden are based on events that occurred in 
late 2015 and early 2016—yet President 
Trump only began to push Ukraine to inves-
tigate these allegations in 2019, when it ap-
peared likely that Vice President Biden 
would enter the 2020 Presidential race to 
challenge President Trump’s reelection. 
The Ukrainian-Election-Interference Pretext. 
The Intelligence Community, Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence, and Special 
Counsel Mueller all unanimously found that 
Russia—not Ukraine—interfered in the 2016 
election. President Trump’s own FBI Direc-
tor confirmed that American law enforce-
ment has ‘‘no information that indicates 
that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presi-
dential election.’’ 72 In fact, the theory of 
Ukrainian interference is Russian propa-
ganda—‘‘a fictional narrative that is being 
perpetrated and propagated by the Russian 
security services themselves’’ to drive a 
wedge 
between 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Ukraine.73 
Thanks to President Trump, this Russian 
propaganda effort is spreading. In November, 
President Vladimir Putin said, ‘‘Thank God 
no one is accusing us of interfering in the 
U.S. elections anymore; now they’re accus-
ing Ukraine.’’ 74 President Trump is correct 
in asserting ‘‘that the United States has a 
compelling interest . . . in limiting the par-
ticipation of foreign citizens in activities of 
American democratic self-government’’ 75— 
and that is exactly why his misconduct is so 
harmful, and warrants removal from Office. 
II. President Trump must be removed for ob-
structing congress 
President Trump has answered the House’s 
constitutional mandate to enforce its ‘‘sole 
power of Impeachment’’ 76 with open defi-
ance: obstructing this constitutional process 
wholesale by withholding documents, direct-
ing witnesses not to appear, threatening 
those who did, and declaring both the courts 
and Congress powerless to compel his com-
pliance. As President Trump flatly stated, ‘‘I 
have an Article II, where I have the right to 
do whatever I want as president.’’ 77 Presi-
dent Trump now seeks to excuse his obstruc-
tion by falsely claiming that he has been 
transparent and by hiding behind hypo-
thetical executive privilege claims that he 
has never invoked and that do not apply. 
A. President Trump’s Claim of Transparency 
Ignores the Facts 
President Trump does not appear to dis-
pute that obstructing Congress during an im-
peachment investigation is itself an im-
peachable offense. He instead falsely insists 
that he ‘‘has been extraordinarily trans-
parent about his interactions with President 
Zelensky[].’’ 78 
President 
Trump’s 
transparency 
claim 
bears no resemblance to the facts. In no un-
certain terms, President Trump has stated 
that ‘‘we’re fighting all the subpoenas [from 
Congress].’’ 79
Later, 
through 
his 
White 
House Counsel, President Trump directed the 
entire Executive Branch to defy the House’s 
subpoenas for documents in the impeach-
ment—and as a result not a single document 
from the Executive Branch was produced to 
the House.80 He also demanded that his cur-
rent and former aides refuse to testify—and 
as a result nine Administration officials 
under subpoena refused to appear.81 That is a 
cover-up, and there is nothing transparent 
about it. 
President Trump emphasizes that he pub-
licly released the memorandum of the July 
25 call with President Zelensky. But Presi-
dent Trump did so only after the public had 
already learned that he had put a hold on 
military aid to Ukraine and after the exist-
ence of the Intelligence Community whistle-
blower complaint became public.82 The fact 
that President Trump selectively released 
limited information under public pressure, 
only to obstruct the House’s investigation 
into his corrupt scheme, does not support his 
assertion of transparency. 
B. President Trump Categorically Refused to 
Comply with the House’s Impeachment In-
quiry 
In an impeachment investigation, the 
House has a constitutional entitlement to 
information concerning the President’s mis-
conduct. President Trump’s categorical ob-
struction would, if accepted, seriously im-
pair the impeachment process the Framers 
carefully crafted to guard against Presi-
dential misconduct.83 
President Trump asserts that individual-
ized disputes regarding responses to Congres-
sional subpoenas do not rise to the level of 
an impeachable offense.84 But this argument 
distorts the categorical nature of his refusal 
to comply with the House’s impeachment in-
vestigation. President Trump has refused 
any and all cooperation and ordered his Ad-
ministration to do the same. No President in 
our history has so flagrantly undermined the 
impeachment process. 
President Nixon ordered ‘‘[a]ll members of 
the White House Staff [to] appear volun-
tarily when requested by the committee,’’ to 
‘‘testify under oath,’’ and to ‘‘answer fully 
all proper questions.’’ 85 Even so, the Judici-
ary Committee voted to impeach him for not 
fully complying with House subpoenas when 
he withheld complete responses to certain 
subpoenas on executive privilege grounds. 
The Committee emphasized that ‘‘the doc-
trine of separation of powers cannot justify 
the withholding of information from an im-
peachment inquiry’’ because ‘‘the very pur-
pose of such an inquiry is to permit the 
[House], acting on behalf of the people, to 
curb the excesses of another branch, in this 
instance the Executive.’’ 86 If President Nix-
on’s obstruction of Congress raised a ‘‘slip-
pery slope’’ concern, then President Trump’s 
complete defiance takes us to the ‘‘bottom of 
the slope, surveying the damage to our Con-
stitution.’’ 87 
President Trump’s attempt to fault the 
House for not using ‘‘other tools at its dis-
posal’’ to secure the withheld information— 
such as seeking judicial enforcement of its 
subpoenas 88—is astonishingly disingenuous. 
President Trump cannot tell the House that 
it must litigate the validity of its subpoenas 
while simultaneously telling the courts that 
they are powerless to enforce them.89 
C. President Trump’s Assertion of Invented 
Immunities Does Not Excuse His Categor-
ical Obstruction 
Having used the power of his office to 
stonewall the House’s impeachment inquiry, 
President Trump has now enlisted his law-
yers in the White House Counsel’s Office— 
and coopted his Department of Justice’s Of-
fice of Legal Counsel—to justify the cover- 
up.90 But his lawyers’ attempts to excuse his 
obstruction do not work. 
One fact is essential to recognize: Presi-
dent Trump has never actually invoked execu-
tive privilege. That is because, under long-
standing law, invoking executive privilege 
would require President Trump to identify 
with particularity the documents or commu-
nications containing sensitive material that 
he seeks to protect. Executive privilege gen-
erally cannot be used to shield misconduct, 
and it does not apply here because President 
Trump and his associates have repeatedly 
and publicly discussed the same matters he 
claims must be kept secret. 
President Trump instead maintains that 
his advisors should be ‘‘absolutely immune’’ 
from compelled Congressional testimony.91 
But this claim of absolute immunity—which 
turns on the theory that certain high-level 
Presidential advisors are ‘‘alter egos’’ of the 
President—cannot possibly justify the deci-
sion to withhold the testimony of the lower- 
level agency officials whom President Trump 
ordered not to testify. Regardless, the so- 
called absolute immunity theory is an inven-
tion of the Executive Branch, and every 
court to consider this argument has rejected 
it—including the Supreme Court in an im-
portant ruling requiring President Nixon to 
disclose the Watergate Tapes.92
In other 
words, President Trump’s defenses depend on 
arguments that disgraced former President 
Nixon litigated and lost. 
President Trump additionally attempts to 
justify his obstruction on the ground that 
Executive Branch counsel were barred from 
attending House depositions.93 Of course, the 
absence of counsel at depositions does not 
excuse the President’s refusal to disclose 
documents in response to the House’s sub-
poenas. And the decades-old rule excluding 
agency counsel from House depositions—first 
adopted by a Republican House of Represent-
atives majority—exists for good reasons. It 
prevents agency officials implicated in Con-
gressional investigations from misleadingly 
shaping the testimony of agency employees. 
It also protects the rights of witnesses to 
speak freely and without fear of reprisal 94— 
a protection indisputably necessary here 
given that President Trump has repeatedly 
sought to intimidate and silence witnesses 
against him.95 
President Trump finally maintains that 
complying with the impeachment inquiry 
would somehow violate the constitutional 
separation of powers doctrine.96 This argu-
ment is exactly backwards. The President 
cannot reserve the right to be the arbiter of 
his own privilege—particularly in an im-
peachment inquiry designed by the Framers 
of the Constitution to uncover Presidential 
misconduct. The fact that President Trump 
has found lawyers willing to concoct theories 
on which documents or testimony might be 
withheld is no basis for his refusal to comply 
with an impeachment inquiry. The check of 
impeachment would be little check at all if 
the law were otherwise. 
III. The House conducted a constitutionally 
valid impeachment process 
As explained in the House Managers’ open-
ing brief, the House conducted a full and fair 
impeachment proceeding with robust proce-
dural 
protections 
for 
President 
Trump, 
which he tellingly chose to ignore. The Com-
mittees took 100 hours of deposition testi-
mony from 17 witnesses with personal knowl-
edge of key events, and all Members of the 
Committees as well as Republican and 
Democratic staff were permitted to attend 
and given equal opportunity to ask ques-
tions. The Committees heard an additional 
30 hours of public testimony from 12 of those 
witnesses, including three requested by the 
Republicans.97
President Trump’s lawyers 
were invited to participate at the public 
hearings before the Judiciary Committee.98 
Rather than do so, he urged the House: ‘‘if 
you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, 
so we can have a fair trial in the Senate.’’ 99 
But faced with his Senate trial, President 
Trump now cites a host of procedural hurdles 
that he claims the House failed to satisfy. 
Nobody should be fooled by this obvious 
gamesmanship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S375 
January 21, 2020 
A. The Constitution Does Not Authorize 
President Trump to Second Guess the 
House’s Exercise of Its ‘‘Sole Power of Im-
peachment’’ 
President Trump’s attack on the House’s 
conduct of its impeachment proceedings dis-
regards the text of the Constitution, which 
gives the House the ‘‘sole Power of Impeach-
ment,’’ 100 and empowers it to ‘‘determine the 
Rules of its Proceedings.’’ 101 As the Supreme 
Court has observed, ‘‘the word ‘sole’ ’’— 
which appears only twice in the Constitu-
tion—‘‘is of considerable significance.’’ 102 In 
the context of the Senate’s ‘‘sole’’ power 
over impeachment trials, the Court stressed 
that this term means that authority is ‘‘re-
posed in the Senate and nowhere else’’ 103 and 
that the Senate ‘‘alone shall have authority 
to determine whether an individual should 
be acquitted or convicted.’’ 104 The House’s 
‘‘sole Power of Impeachment’’ likewise vests 
it with the independent authority to struc-
ture its impeachment proceedings in the 
manner it deems appropriate. The Constitu-
tion leaves no room for President Trump to 
object to how the House, in the exercise of 
its ‘‘sole’’ power to determine impeachment, 
conducted its proceedings here. 
President Trump has no basis to assert 
that the impeachment inquiry was ‘‘flawed 
from the start’’ because it began before a for-
mal House vote was taken.105 Neither the 
Constitution nor the House rules requires 
such a vote.106 And notwithstanding Presi-
dent Trump’s refrain that the House’s in-
quiry ‘‘violated every precedent and every 
principle of fairness followed in impeach-
ment inquiries for more than 150 years,’’ 107 
House precedent makes clear that an im-
peachment inquiry does not require a House 
vote. As even President Trump is forced to 
acknowledge, several impeachment inquiries 
conducted in the House ‘‘did not begin with 
a 
House 
resolution 
authorizing 
an 
in-
quiry.’’ 108 In fact, the House has impeached 
several federal judges without ever passing 
such a resolution 109—and the Senate then 
convicted and removed them from office.110 
Here, by contrast, the House adopted a reso-
lution confirming the investigating Commit-
tees’ authority to conduct their inquiry into 
‘‘whether sufficient grounds exist for the 
House of Representatives to exercise its Con-
stitutional power to impeach Donald John 
Trump, President of the United States of 
America.’’ 111 
President Trump is similarly mistaken 
that a formal ‘‘delegation of authority’’ to 
the Committees was needed at the outset.112 
The House adopted its Rules 113—‘‘a power 
that the Rulemaking Clause [of the Con-
stitution] reserves to each House alone’’ 114— 
but did not specify rules that would govern 
impeachment inquiries. It is thus difficult to 
understand how the House’s impeachment 
inquiry could violate its rules or delegation 
authority. Not only did Speaker Pelosi in-
struct the Committees to proceed with an 
‘‘impeachment inquiry,’’ 115 but in passing H. 
Res. 660, the full House ‘‘directed’’ the Com-
mittees to ‘‘continue their ongoing inves-
tigations as part of the existing House of 
Representatives 
inquiry’’ 
into 
impeach-
ment.116 
President Trump is wrong that the sub-
poenas were ‘‘unauthorized and invalid’’ be-
cause they were not approved in advance by 
the House.117 There is no requirement in ei-
ther the Constitution or the House Rules 
that the House vote on subpoenas. Indeed, 
such a requirement would be inconsistent 
with the operations of the House, which in 
modern times largely functions through its 
Committees.118 The absence of specific proce-
dures prescribing how the House and its 
Committees must conduct impeachment in-
quiries allows those extraordinary inquiries 
to be conducted in the manner the House 
deems most fair, efficient, and appropriate. 
But even assuming a House vote on the sub-
poenas was necessary, there was such a vote 
here. When it adopted H. Res. 660, the House 
understood that numerous subpoenas had al-
ready been issued as part of the impeach-
ment inquiry. As the Report accompanying 
the Resolution explained, these ‘‘duly au-
thorized subpoenas’’ issued to the Executive 
Branch ‘‘remain in full force.’’ 119 
B. President Trump Received Fair Process 
As his lawyers well know, the various 
criminal trial rights that President Trump 
demands have no place in the House’s im-
peachment process.120 It is not a trial, much 
less a criminal trial to which Fifth or Sixth 
Amendment guarantees would attach. The 
rights President Trump has demanded have 
never been recognized in any prior Presi-
dential impeachment investigation, just as 
they have never been recognized for a person 
under investigation by a grand jury—a more 
apt analogy to the House’s proceedings here. 
Although 
President 
Trump 
faults 
the 
House for not allowing him to participate in 
depositions and witness interviews, no Presi-
dent has ever been permitted to participate 
during this initial fact-finding process. For 
example, the Judiciary Committee during 
the Nixon impeachment found ‘‘[n]o record 
. . . of any impeachment inquiry in which 
the official under investigation participated 
in the investigation stage preceding com-
mencement of Committee hearings.’’ 121 In 
both the President Nixon and President Clin-
ton impeachment inquiries, the President’s 
counsel was not permitted to participate in 
or even attend depositions and interviews of 
witnesses.122 And in both cases, the House re-
lied substantially on investigative findings 
by special prosecutors and grand juries, nei-
ther of which allowed the participation of 
the target of the investigation.123 Indeed, the 
reasons grand jury proceedings are kept con-
fidential—‘‘to prevent subornation of perjury 
or tampering with the witnesses who may 
testify before grand jury’’ and ‘‘encourage 
free and untrammeled disclosures by persons 
who have information,’’ 124—apply with spe-
cial force here, given President Trump’s 
chilling pattern of witness intimidation.125 
In his litany of process complaints, Presi-
dent Trump notably omits the fact that his 
counsel could have participated in the pro-
ceedings before the Judiciary Committee in 
multiple ways. The President, through his 
counsel, could have objected during witness 
examinations, cross-examined witnesses, and 
submitted evidence of his own.126 President 
Trump simply chose not to have his counsel 
do so. Having deliberately chosen not to 
avail himself of these procedural protec-
tions, President Trump cannot now pretend 
they did not exist. 
Nor is the President entitled to have the 
charges against him proven beyond a reason-
able doubt.127 That burden of proof is appli-
cable in criminal trials, where lives and lib-
erties are at stake, not in impeachments. 
For this reason, the Senate has rejected the 
proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in 
prior impeachments 128 and instead has ‘‘left 
the choice of the applicable standard of proof 
to each individual Senator.’’ 129 Once again, 
President Trump’s lawyers well know this 
fact. 
President Trump’s contention that the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment must fail on grounds 
of ‘‘duplicity’’ is wrong. President Trump al-
leges that the Articles are ‘‘structurally de-
ficient’’ because they ‘‘charge[] multiple dif-
ferent acts as possible grounds for sustaining 
a conviction.’’ 130 But this simply repeats the 
argument from the impeachment trial of 
President Clinton, which differed from Presi-
dent Trump’s impeachment in this critical 
respect. Where the articles charged Presi-
dent Clinton with engaging in ‘‘one or more’’ 
of several acts,131 the Articles of Impeach-
ment against President Trump do not. This 
difference distinguishes President Trump’s 
case from President Clinton’s—where, in any 
event, the Senate rejected the effort to have 
the articles of impeachment dismissed as 
duplicitous. The bottom line is that the 
House knew precisely what it was doing 
when it drafted and adopted the Articles of 
Impeachment against President Trump, and 
deliberately avoided the possible problem 
raised 
in 
the 
impeachment 
proceedings 
against President Clinton. 
There was no procedural flaw in the 
House’s impeachment inquiry. But even as-
suming there were, that would be irrelevant 
to the Senate’s separate exercise of its ‘‘sole 
Power to try all Impeachments.’’ 132
Any 
imagined defect in the House’s previous pro-
ceedings could be cured when the evidence is 
presented to the Senate at trial. President 
Trump, after all, touted his desire to ‘‘have 
a fair trial in the Senate.’’ 133 And as Presi-
dent Trump admits, it is the Senate’s ‘‘con-
stitutional duty to decide for itself all mat-
ters of law and fact bearing upon this 
trial.’’ 134
Acquitting President Trump on 
baseless objections to the House’s process 
would be an abdication by the Senate of this 
duty.

(1836) (‘‘The word crime has no technical 
meaning in the law of England. It seems, 
when it has a reference to positive law, to 
comprehend those acts which subject the of-
fender to punishment. When the words high 
crimes and misdemeanors are used in prosecu-
tions by impeachment, the words high crimes 
have no definite signification, but are used 
merely to give greater solemnity to the

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
for the further information of all Sen-
ators, I am about to send a resolution 
to the desk that provides for an outline 
of the next steps in these proceedings. 
It will be debatable by the parties for 2 
hours, equally divided. Senator SCHU-
MER will then send an amendment to 
the resolution to the desk. Once that 
amendment has been offered and re-
corded, we will have a brief recess. 
When we reconvene, Senator SCHU-
MER’s amendment will be debatable by 
the parties for 2 hours. Upon the use or 
yielding back of time, I intend to move 
to table Senator SCHUMER’s amend-
ment.

filed with the Secretary and be printed and 
made available to all parties. 
Arguments on such motions shall begin at 
1 p.m. on Wednesday, January 22, 2020, and 
each side may determine the number of per-
sons to make its presentation, following 
which the Senate shall deliberate, if so or-
dered under the impeachment rules, and vote 
on any such motions. 
Following the disposition of such motions, 
or if no motions are made, then the House of 
Representatives shall make its presentation 
in support of the articles of impeachment for 
a period of time not to exceed 24 hours, over 
up to 3 session days. Following the House of 
Representatives’ presentation, the President 
shall make his presentation for a period not 
to exceed 24 hours, over up to 3 session days. 
Each side may determine the number of per-
sons to make its presentation. 
Upon the conclusion of the President’s 
presentation, Senators may question the 
parties for a period of time not to exceed 16 
hours. 
Upon the conclusion of questioning by the 
Senate, there shall be 4 hours of argument 
by the parties, equally divided, followed by 
deliberation by the Senate, if so ordered 
under the impeachment rules, on the ques-
tion of whether it shall be in order to con-
sider and debate under the impeachment 
rules any motion to subpoena witnesses or 
documents. The Senate, without any inter-
vening action, motion, or amendment, shall 
then decide by the yeas and nays whether it 
shall be in order to consider and debate 
under the impeachment rules any motion to 
subpoena witnesses or documents. 
Following the disposition of that question, 
other motions provided under the impeach-
ment rules shall be in order. 
If the Senate agrees to allow either the 
House of Representatives or the President to 
subpoena witnesses, the witnesses shall first 
be deposed and the Senate shall decide after 
deposition which witnesses shall testify, pur-
suant to the impeachment rules. No testi-
mony shall be admissible in the Senate un-
less the parties have had an opportunity to 
depose such witnesses. 
At the conclusion of the deliberations by 
the Senate, the Senate shall vote on each ar-
ticle of impeachment. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The resolution 
is arguable by the parties for 2 hours, 
equally divided. 
Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a pro-
ponent or an opponent of this motion? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, the House managers are in opposi-
tion to this resolution. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Mr. Cipollone, are you a proponent or 
an opponent of the motion? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. We are a 
proponent of the motion. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, 
your side may proceed first, and we 
will be able to reserve rebuttal time if 
you wish. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL, Demo-
cratic Leader SCHUMER, Senators, my 
name is Pat Cipollone. I am here as 
counsel to the President of the United 
States. Our team is proud to be here, 
representing President Trump. 
We support this resolution. It is a 
fair way to proceed with this trial. It is 
modeled on the Clinton resolution, 
which had 100 Senators supporting it 
the last time this body considered im-
peachment. It requires the House man-
agers to stand up and make their open-
ing statement and make their case. 
They have delayed bringing this im-
peachment to this body for 33 days, and 
it is time to start with this trial. It is 
a fair process. They will have the op-
portunity to stand up and make their 
opening statement. They will get 24 
hours to do that. Then the President’s 
attorneys will have a chance to re-
spond. After that, all of you will have 
16 hours to ask whatever questions you 
have of either side. Once that is fin-
ished and you have all of that informa-
tion, we will proceed to the question of 
witnesses and some of the more dif-
ficult questions that will come before 
this body. 
We are in favor of this. We believe 
that once you hear those initial presen-
tations, the only conclusion will be 
that the President has done absolutely 
nothing wrong and that these Articles 
of Impeachment do not begin to ap-
proach the standard required by the 
Constitution, and, in fact, they them-
selves will establish nothing beyond 
those articles. You will look at those 
articles alone, and you will determine 
that there is absolutely no case. 
So we respectfully ask you to adopt 
this resolution so that we can begin 
with this process. It is long past time 
to start this proceeding, and we are 
here today to do it, and we hope that 
the House managers will agree with us 
and begin this proceeding today. 
We reserve the remainder of our time 
for rebuttal. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, and counsel for the 
President, the House managers, on be-
half of the House of Representatives, 
rise in opposition to Leader MCCON-
NELL’s resolution. 
Let me begin by summarizing why. 
Last week we came before you to 
present the Articles of Impeachment 
against the President of the United 
States for only the third time in our 
history. Those articles charge Presi-
dent Donald John Trump with abuse of 
power and obstruction of Congress. The 
misconduct set out in those articles is 
the most serious ever charged against a 
President. 
The first article, abuse of power, 
charges the President with soliciting a 
foreign power to help him cheat in the 
next election. Moreover, it alleges— 
and we will prove—that he sought to 
coerce Ukraine into helping him cheat 
by withholding official acts—two offi-
cial acts: a meeting that the new Presi-
dent of Ukraine desperately sought 
with President Trump at the White 
House to show the world and the Rus-
sians, in particular, that the Ukranian 
President had a good relationship with 
his most important patron, the Presi-
dent of the United States. And even 
more perniciously, President Trump il-
legally withheld almost $400 million in 
taxpayer-funded military assistance to 
Ukraine, a nation at war with our Rus-
sian adversary, to compel Ukraine to 
help him cheat in the election. 
Astonishingly, the President’s trial 
brief, filed yesterday, contends that 
even if this conduct is proved, that 
there is nothing that the House or this 
Senate may do about it. It is the Presi-
dent’s apparent belief that under arti-
cle II he can do anything he wants, no 
matter how corrupt, outfitted in gaudy 
legal clothing. 
And yet, when the Founders wrote 
the impeachment clause, they had pre-
cisely this type of misconduct in 
mind—conduct that abuses the power 
of his office for personal benefit, that 
undermines our national security, that 
invites foreign interference in our 
democratic process of an election. It is 
the trifecta of constitutional mis-
conduct justifying impeachment. 
In article II the President is charged 
with other misconduct that would like-
wise have alarmed the Founders—the 
full, complete, and absolute obstruc-
tion of a coequal branch of govern-
ment, the Congress, during the course 
of its impeachment investigation into 
the President’s own misconduct. This 
is every bit as destructive to our con-
stitutional order as the misconduct 
charged in the first article. 
If a President can obstruct his own 
investigation, if he can effectively nul-
lify a power the Constitution gives 
solely to Congress—indeed, the ulti-
mate power—the ultimate power the 
Constitution gives to prevent Presi-
dential misconduct, then, the Presi-
dent places himself beyond account-
ability, above the law. He cannot be in-
dicted, cannot be impeached. It makes 
him a monarch, the very evil against 
which our Constitution and the balance 
of powers it carefully laid out was de-
signed to guard against. 
Shortly, the trial in these charges 
will begin, and when it has concluded, 
you will be asked to make several de-
terminations. Did the House prove that 
the President abused his power by 
seeking to coerce a foreign nation to 
help him cheat in the next election; 
and did he obstruct the Congress in its 
investigation into his own misconduct 
by ordering his agencies and officers to 
refuse to cooperate in any way—to 
refuse to testify, to refuse to answer 
subpoenas for documents, and through 
every other means. 
And if the House has proved its 
case—and we believe the evidence will 
not be seriously contested—you will 
have to answer at least one other crit-
ical question: Does the commission of 
these high crimes and misdemeanors 
require the conviction and removal of 
the President? 
We believe that it does, and that the 
Constitution requires that it be so or 
the 
power 
of 
impeachment 
must 
deemed irrelevant or a casualty to par-
tisan times and the American people 
left unprotected against a President 
who would abuse his power for the very 
purpose of corrupting the only other 
method of accountability, our elections 
themselves. 
And so you will vote to find the 
President guilty or not guilty, to find 
his conduct impeachable or not im-
peachable. But I would submit to you

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S379 
January 21, 2020 
these are not the most important deci-
sions you will make. 
How can that be? How can any deci-
sion you will make be more important 
than guilt or innocence, than removing 
the President or not removing the 
President? 
I believe the most important decision 
in this case is the one you will make 
today. The most important question is 
the question you must answer today. 
Will the President and the American 
people get a fair trial? Will there be a 
fair trial? 
I submit that this is an even more 
important question than how you vote 
on guilt or innocence, because whether 
we have a fair trial will determine 
whether you have a basis to render a 
fair 
and 
impartial 
verdict. 
It 
is 
foundational—the 
structure 
upon 
which every other decision you will 
make must rest. 
If you only get to see part of the evi-
dence, if you only allow one side or the 
other a chance to present their full 
case, your verdict will be predeter-
mined by the bias in the proceeding. If 
the defendant is not allowed to intro-
duce evidence of his innocence, it is not 
a fair trial. So too for the prosecution. 
If the House cannot call witnesses or 
introduce documents and evidence, it is 
not a fair trial. It is not really a trial 
at all. 
Americans all over the country are 
watching us right now, and imagine 
they are on jury duty. Imagine that the 
judge walks into that courtroom and 
says that she has been talking to the 
defendant, and at the defendant’s re-
quest, the judge has agreed not to let 
the prosecution call any witnesses or 
introduce any documents. The judge 
and the defendant have agreed that the 
prosecutor may only read to the jury 
the dry transcripts of the grand jury 
proceedings. That is it. 
Has anyone on jury duty in this 
country ever heard a judge describe 
such a proceeding and call it a fair 
trial? Of course not. That is not a fair 
trial. It is a mockery of a trial. 
Under the Constitution, this pro-
ceeding, the one we are in right now, is 
the trial. This is not the appeal from a 
trial. You are not appellate court 
judges. OK, one of you is. And unless 
this trial is going to be different from 
any other impeachment trial or any 
other kind of trial, for that matter, 
you must allow the prosecution and de-
fense, the House managers and the 
President’s lawyers, to call relevant 
witnesses. You must subpoena docu-
ments that the President has blocked 
but which bear on his guilt or inno-
cence. You must impartially do just as 
your oath requires. 
So what does a fair trial look like in 
the context of impeachment? The short 
answer is it looks like every other 
trial. First, the resolution should allow 
the House managers to obtain docu-
ments that have been withheld—first, 
not last—because the documents will 
inform the decision about which wit-
nesses are most important to call. And 
when the witnesses are called, the doc-
umentary evidence will be available 
and must be available to question them 
with. Any other order makes no sense. 
Next, the resolution should allow the 
House managers to call their witnesses, 
and then the President should be al-
lowed to do the same, and any rebuttal 
witnesses. And when the evidentiary 
portion of the trial ends, the parties 
argue the case. You deliberate and 
render a verdict. 
If there is a dispute as to whether a 
particular witness is relevant or mate-
rial to the charges brought, under the 
Senate rules, the Chief Justice would 
rule on the issue of materiality. 
Why should this trial be different 
than any other trial? The short answer 
is it shouldn’t. But Leader MCCON-
NELL’s resolution would turn the trial 
process on its head. His resolution re-
quires the House to prove its case with-
out witnesses, without documents, and 
only after it is done will such questions 
be entertained, with no guarantee that 
any witnesses or any documents will be 
allowed even then. That process makes 
no sense. 
So what is the harm of waiting until 
the end of the trial, of kicking the can 
down the road on the question of docu-
ments and witnesses? Beside the fact it 
is completely backwards—trial first, 
then evidence—beside the fact that the 
documents would inform the decision 
on which witnesses and help in their 
questioning, the harm is this: You will 
not have any of the evidence the Presi-
dent continues to conceal throughout 
most or all of the trial. 
And although the evidence against 
the President is already overwhelming, 
you may never know the full scope of 
the President’s misconduct or those 
around him, and neither will the Amer-
ican people. 
The charges here involve the sac-
rifice of our national security at home 
and abroad and a threat to the integ-
rity of the next election. If there are 
additional remedial steps that need to 
be taken after the President’s convic-
tion, the American people must know 
about it. 
But if, as a public already jaded by 
experience has come to suspect, this 
resolution is merely the first step of an 
effort orchestrated by the White House 
to rush the trial, hide the evidence, and 
render a fast verdict, or worse, a fast 
dismissal to make the President go 
away as quickly as possible, to cover 
up his misdeeds, then the American 
people will be deprived of a fair trial 
and may never learn just how deep the 
corruption of this administration goes 
or what other risk to our security and 
elections remain hidden. 
The harm will also endure for this 
body. If the Senate allows the Presi-
dent to get away with such extensive 
obstruction, it will affect the Senate’s 
power of subpoena and oversight just 
as much as the House. The Senate’s 
ability to conduct oversight will be be-
holden to the desires of this President 
and future Presidents, whether he or 
she decides they want to cooperate 
with a Senate investigation or another 
impeachment inquiry and trial. Our 
system of checks and balances will be 
broken. Presidents will become ac-
countable to no one. 
Now, it has been reported that Lead-
er MCCONNELL
has already got the 
votes to pass his resolution, the text of 
which we did not see until last night, 
and which has been changed even mo-
ments ago. 
And they say that Leader MCCON-
NELL is a very good vote counter. None-
theless, I hope that he is wrong, and 
not just because I think this process— 
the process contemplated by this reso-
lution—is backwards and designed with 
a result in mind and that the result is 
not a fair trial. I hope that he is wrong 
because whatever Senators may have 
said or pledged or committed has been 
superseded by an event of constitu-
tional dimensions. You have all now 
sworn an oath—not to each other, not 
to your legislative leadership, not to 
the managers or even to the Chief Jus-
tice. You have sworn an oath to do im-
partial justice. That oath binds you. 
That oath supersedes all else. 
Many of you in the Senate and many 
of us in the House have made state-
ments about the President’s conduct or 
this trial or this motion or expecta-
tions. None of that matters now. That 
is all in the past. Nothing matters now 
but the oath to do impartial justice, 
and that oath requires a fair trial—fair 
to the President and fair to the Amer-
ican people. 
But is that really possible? Or as the 
Founders feared, has factionalism or an 
excessive partisanship made that now 
impossible? 
One way to find out what a fair trial 
should look like, devoid of partisan 
consideration, is to ask yourselves how 
would you structure the trial if you 
didn’t know what your party was and 
you didn’t know what the party of the 
President was? Would it make sense to 
you to have the trial first and then de-
cide on witnesses and evidence later? 
Would that be fair to both sides? I have 
to think that your answer would be no. 
Let me be blunt. Let me be very 
blunt. Right now a great many, per-
haps even most, Americans do not be-
lieve there will be a fair trial. They 
don’t believe that the Senate will be 
impartial. They believe that the result 
is precooked. The President will be ac-
quitted, not because he is innocent—he 
is not—but because the Senators will 
vote by party, and he has the votes— 
the votes to prevent the evidence from 
coming out, the votes to make sure the 
public never sees it. 
The American people want a fair 
trial. They want to believe their sys-
tem of governance is still capable of 
rising to the occasion. They want to 
believe that we can rise above party 
and do what is best for the country, but 
a great many Americans don’t believe 
that will happen. 
Let’s prove them wrong. Let’s prove 
them wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S380 
January 21, 2020 
How? By convicting the President? 
No, not by conviction alone, by con-
victing him if the House proves its case 
and only if the House proves its case, 
but by letting the House prove its case, 
by letting the House call witnesses, by 
letting the House obtain documents, by 
letting the House decide how to present 
its own case and not deciding it for 
us—in sum, by agreeing to a fair trial. 
Now let’s turn to the precise terms of 
the resolution, the history of impeach-
ment trials, and what fairness and im-
partiality require. 
Although we have many concerns 
about the resolution, I will begin with 
its single biggest flaw. The resolution 
does not ensure that subpoenas will, in 
fact, be issued for additional evidence 
that the Senate and the American peo-
ple should have—and that the Presi-
dent continues to block—to fairly de-
cide the President’s guilt or innocence. 
Moreover, it guarantees that such sub-
poenas will not be issued now, when it 
would be most valuable to the Senate, 
the parties, and the American people. 
According to the resolution the lead-
er has introduced, first the Senate re-
ceives briefs and filings from the par-
ties. Next it hears lengthy presen-
tations from the House and the Presi-
dent. Now my colleagues, the Presi-
dent’s lawyers, have described this as 
opening statements. But let’s not kid 
ourselves; that is the trial that they 
contemplate. The opening statements 
are the trial. They will either be most 
of the trial or they will be all of the 
trial. If the Senate votes to deprive 
itself of witnesses and documents, the 
opening statements will be the end of 
the trial. So to say ‘‘Let’s just have the 
opening statements, and then we will 
see’’ means ‘‘Let’s have the trial, and 
maybe we can sweep this all under the 
rug.’’ 
So we will hear these lengthy presen-
tations from the House. There will be a 
question-and-answer 
period 
for 
the 
Senators, and then—and only then— 
after, essentially, the trial is over, 
after the briefs have been filed, after 
the arguments have been made, and 
after Senators have exhausted other 
questions, only then will the Senate 
consider whether to subpoena crucial 
documents and witness testimony that 
the President has desperately tried to 
conceal from this Congress and the 
American people—documents and wit-
ness testimony that, unlike the Clin-
ton trial, have not yet been seen or 
heard. 
It is true that the record compiled by 
the House is overwhelming. It is true 
the record already compels the convic-
tion of the President in the face of un-
precedented resistance by the Presi-
dent. The House has assembled a pow-
erful case, evidence of the President’s 
high crimes and misdemeanors that in-
cludes direct evidence and testimony of 
officials who were unwilling and unwit-
ting in this scheme and saw it for what 
it was. Yet there is still more evi-
dence—relative 
and 
probative 
evi-
dence—that the President continues to 
block that would flesh out the full ex-
tent of the President’s misconduct and 
those around him. 
We have seen that, over the past few 
weeks, new evidence has continued to 
come to light as the nonpartisan Gov-
ernment Accountability Office has de-
termined that the hold on military aid 
to Ukraine was illegal and broke the 
law; as John Bolton has offered to tes-
tify in the trial; as one of the Presi-
dent’s agents, Lev Parnas, has pro-
duced 
documentary 
evidence 
that 
clarifies Mr. Giuliani’s activities on be-
half of the President and corroborates 
Ambassador Sondland’s testimony that 
everyone was in the loop; as documents 
released under the Freedom of Infor-
mation 
Act 
have 
documented 
the 
alarm at the Department of Defense 
that the President illegally withheld 
military support for Ukraine, an ally 
at war with Russia, without expla-
nation; as the senior Office of Manage-
ment and Budget official, Michael 
Duffey, instructed Department of De-
fense officials on July 25, 90 minutes 
after President Trump spoke by phone 
with President Zelensky, that the De-
fense Department should pause all obli-
gation of Ukraine military assistance 
under its purview—90 minutes after 
that call. 
Duffey added, ‘‘Given the sensitive 
nature of the request, I appreciate your 
keeping that information closely held 
to those who need to know to execute 
the direction.’’ 
Although the evidence is already 
more than sufficient to convict, there 
is simply no rational basis for the Sen-
ate to deprive itself of all relevant in-
formation in making such a hugely 
consequential judgment. 
Moreover, as the President’s answer 
to his summons and his trial brief 
made clear, the President intends to 
contest the facts in false and mis-
leading ways. 
But the President should not have it 
both ways. He should not be permitted 
to claim that the facts uncovered by 
the House are wrong while also con-
cealing mountains of evidence that 
bear precisely on those facts. 
If this body seeks impartial justice, 
it should ensure that subpoenas are 
issued and that they are issued now, 
before the Senate begins extended pro-
ceedings based on a record that every 
person in this room and every Amer-
ican watching at home knows does not 
include documents and witness testi-
mony it should because the President 
would not allow it to be so. 
Complying 
with 
these 
subpoenas 
would not impose a burden. The sub-
poenas cover narrowly tailored and tar-
geted documents and witnesses that 
the President has concealed. 
The Senate deserves to see the docu-
ments from the White House, the State 
Department, the Office of Management 
and Budget, and the Department of De-
fense. These agencies already should 
have collected and at least preserved 
these documents in response to House 
subpoenas. 
Indeed, in some cases agencies have 
already produced documents in FOIA 
lawsuits, albeit in heavily redacted 
form. Witnesses with direct knowledge 
or involvement should be heard. That 
includes the President’s Acting Chief of 
Staff, Mick Mulvaney; his former Na-
tional Security Advisor, John Bolton, 
who has publicly offered to testify— 
two senior officials integral to imple-
menting 
the 
President’s 
freeze 
on 
Ukraine’s military aid also have very 
relevant testimony; why not hear it?— 
Robert 
Blair, 
who 
served 
as 
Mr. 
Mulvaney’s senior adviser; Michael 
Duffey, a senior official at OMB; and 
other witnesses with direct knowledge 
whom we reserve the right to call 
later—but these witnesses with whom 
we wish to begin the trial. 
Last month, President Trump made 
clear that he supported having senior 
officials testifying before the Senate 
during his trial, declaring that he 
would 
‘‘love’’ 
to 
have 
Secretary 
Pompeo, Mr. Mulvaney, now former 
Secretary Perry, and ‘‘many other peo-
ple testify’’ in the Senate trial: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
So, when it’s fair, and it will be fair in the 
Senate, I would love to have Mike Pompeo, 
I’d like to have Mick, I’d love to have Rick 
Perry and many other people testify. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The Senate 
has an opportunity to take the Presi-
dent up on his offer to make his senior 
aides available, including Secretaries 
Perry and Pompeo. 
But now the President is changing 
his tune. The bluster of wanting these 
witnesses to testify is over. Notwith-
standing the fact that he has never as-
serted the claim of privilege in the 
course of the House impeachment pro-
ceedings, he threatens to invoke one 
now in a last-ditch effort to keep the 
rest of the truth from coming out. 
The President sends his lawyers here 
to breathlessly claim that these wit-
nesses or others cannot possibly testify 
because it involves national security. 
Never mind that it was the President’s 
actions in withholding military aid 
from an ally at war that threatened 
our national security in the first place. 
Never mind that the most impeachable, 
serious offenses will always involve na-
tional security because they will in-
volve other nations, and that mis-
conduct based on foreign entanglement 
is what the Framers feared most. 
The President’s absurdist argument 
amounts to this: We must endanger na-
tional security to protect national se-
curity. We must make a President’s 
conduct threatening our security be-
yond the reach of impeachment powers 
if we are to save the Presidency. 
This is dangerous nonsense. 
As Justices of the Supreme Court 
have underscored, the Constitution is 
not a suicide pact. 
But let us turn from the abstract to 
the very concrete, and let me show you 
just one example of what the President 
is hiding in the name of national secu-
rity. 
There is a document, which the 
President has refused to turn over, in

S381 
January 21, 2020 
which his top diplomat in Ukraine says 
to two other appointees of the Presi-
dent: ‘‘As I said on the phone, I think 
it’s crazy to withhold security assist-
ance for help with a political cam-
paign.’’ 
The administration refuses to turn 
over that document and so many more. 
We only know about its existence, we 
have only seen its contents because it 
was turned over by a cooperating wit-
ness. 
This is what the President would 
hide from you and from the American 
people. In the name of national secu-
rity, he would hide graphic evidence of 
his dangerous misconduct. The only 
question is—and it is the question 
raised by this resolution—Will you let 
him? 
Last year, President Trump said that 
article II of the Constitution would 
allow him to do anything he wanted, 
and evidently believing that article II 
empowered him to denigrate and defy a 
coequal branch of government, he also 
declared that he would fight all sub-
poenas. Let’s hear the President’s own 
words: ‘‘Then I have an Article II, 
where I have the right to do whatever 
I want as President.’’ 
True to his pledge to obstruct Con-
gress, when President Trump faced an 
impeachment inquiry in the House of 
Representatives, he ordered the execu-
tive branch to defy every single request 
on every single subpoena. He issued 
this order through his White House 
Counsel, Pat Cipollone, on October 8— 
the same counsel who stood before you 
a moment ago to defend the President’s 
misconduct. He then affirmed it again 
at a rally on October 10. 
Following President Trump’s cat-
egorical order, we never received the 
documents and communications. It is 
important to note, in refusing to re-
spond to Congress, the President did 
not make any—any—formal claim of 
privilege, ever. Instead, Mr. Cipollone’s 
letter stated, in effect, that the Presi-
dent would withhold all evidence from 
the executive branch unless the House 
surrendered to demands that would ef-
fectively place President Trump in 
charge of the inquiry into his own mis-
conduct. 
Needless to say, that was a non-
starter and designed to be so. The 
President was determined to obstruct 
Congress no matter what we did, and 
his conduct since—his attacks on the 
impeachment inquiry, his attacks on 
witnesses—has affirmed that the Presi-
dent never had any intention to co-
operate under any circumstance. And 
why? Because the evidence and testi-
mony he conceals would only further 
prove his guilt. The innocent do not 
act this way. 
Simply stated, this trial should not 
reward the President’s obstruction by 
allowing him to control what evidence 
is seen and when it is seen and what 
evidence will remain hidden. The docu-
ments the President seeks to conceal 
include White House records, including 
records about the President’s unlawful 
hold on military aid; State Department 
records, including text messages and 
WhatsApp messages exchanged by the 
State Department and Ukrainian offi-
cials and notes to file by career offi-
cials as they saw the President’s 
scheme 
unfold 
in 
realtime; 
OMB 
records demonstrating evidence to fab-
ricate an after-the-fact rationale for 
the President’s order, showing internal 
objections that the President’s orders 
violated the law; Defense Department 
records reflecting baffle and alarm that 
the President suspended military aid to 
a key security partner without expla-
nation. 
Many of the President’s aides have 
also followed his orders and refused to 
testify. These include essential figures 
in the impeachment inquiry, including 
White House Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney, former National Security 
Advisor John Bolton, and many others 
with relevant testimony, like Robert 
Blair and Michael Duffey. Mr. Blair, 
who serves as a senior adviser to Act-
ing Chief of Staff Mulvaney, worked di-
rectly with Mr. Duffey, a political ap-
pointee in the Office of Management 
and Budget, to carry out the Presi-
dent’s order to freeze vital military 
and security assistance to Ukraine. 
The Trump administration has re-
fused to disclose their communica-
tions, even though we know from writ-
ten testimony, public reporting, and 
even Freedom of Information Act law-
suits that they were instrumental in 
implementing the hold and extending 
it at the President’s express direction 
even—even—as career officials warned 
accurately that doing so would violate 
the law. 
The President has also made the in-
supportable 
claim 
that 
the 
House 
should have enforced its subpoenas in 
court and allowed the President’s im-
peachment to delay for years. If we had 
done so, we would have abdicated our 
constitutional duty to act on the over-
whelming facts before us and the evi-
dence the President was seeking to 
cheat in the next election. 
We could not engage in a deliberately 
protracted court process while the 
President continued to threaten the 
sanctity of our elections. 
Resorting to the courts is also incon-
sistent with the Constitution that 
gives the House the sole power of im-
peachment. If the House were com-
pelled to exhaust all legal remedies be-
fore impeaching the President, it would 
interpose the courts or the decision of 
a single judge between the House and 
the power to impeach. Moreover, it 
would invite the President to present 
his own impeachment by endlessly liti-
gating the matter in court—appealing 
every judgment, engaging in any frivo-
lous motion or device. Indeed, in the 
case of Don McGhan—the President’s 
lawyer, who was ordered to fire the 
special counsel and lie about it—he was 
subpoenaed by the House in April of 
last year, and there is still no final 
judgment. 
A President may not defeat impeach-
ment or accountability by engaging in 
endless litigation. Instead, it has been 
the long practice of the House to com-
pile core evidence necessary to reach a 
reasoned decision about whether to im-
peach and then to bring the case here 
to the Senate for a full trial. That is 
exactly what we did here, with an un-
derstanding that the Senate has its 
own power to compel documents and 
testimony. 
It would be one thing if the House 
had shown no interest in documents or 
witnesses during its investigation—al-
though, even there, the House has the 
sole right to determine its proceedings 
as long as it makes the full case to the 
House, as it did—but it is quite another 
when the President is the cause of his 
own complaint, when the President 
withholds witnesses and documents 
and then attempts to rely on his own 
noncompliance to justify further con-
cealment. 
President Trump made it crystal 
clear that we would never see a single 
document or a single witness when he 
declared, as we just watched, that he 
would fight all subpoenas. As a matter 
of history and precedent, it would be 
wrong to assert that the Senate is un-
able to obtain and review new evidence 
during a Senate trial regardless of why 
evidence was not produced in the 
House. 
You can and should insist on receiv-
ing all the evidence so you can render 
impartial justice and can earn the con-
fidence of the public in the Senate’s 
willingness to hold a fair trial. 
Under the Constitution, the Senate 
does not just vote on impeachments. It 
does not just debate them. Instead, it 
is commanded by the Constitution to 
try all cases of impeachment. If the 
Founders intended for the House to try 
the matter and the Senate to consider 
an appeal based on the cold record from 
the other Chamber, they would have 
said so, but they did not. Instead, they 
gave us the power to charge and you 
the power to try all impeachments. 
The Framers chose their language 
and the structure for a reason. As Alex-
ander Hamilton said, the Senate is 
given ‘‘awful discretion’’ in matters of 
impeachment. The Constitution thus 
speaks to Senators in their judicial 
character as a court for the trial of im-
peachments. It requires them to aim at 
real demonstrations of innocence or 
guilt and requires them to do so by 
holding a trial. 
The Senate has repeatedly subpoe-
naed and received new documents, 
often many of them while adjudicating 
cases of impeachment. Moreover, the 
Senate has heard witness testimony in 
every one of the 15 Senate trials—full 
Senate trials—in the history of this 
Republic, including those of Presidents 
Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. In-
deed, in President Andrew Johnson’s 
Senate impeachment trial, the House 
managers were permitted to begin pre-
senting documentary evidence to the 
Senate on the very first day of the 
trial. The House managers’ initial pres-
entation of documents in President

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S382 
January 21, 2020 
Johnson’s case carried on for the first 
2 days of trial and immediately after 
witnesses were called to appear in the 
Senate. 
This has been the standard practice 
in prior impeachment trials. Indeed, in 
most trials, this body has heard from 
many witnesses, ranging from 3 in 
President Clinton’s case to 40 in Presi-
dent Johnson’s case and well over 60 in 
other impeachments. As these numbers 
make clear, the Senate has always 
heard from key witnesses when trying 
an impeachment. 
The notion that only evidence that 
was taken before the House should be 
considered is squarely and unequivo-
cally contrary to Senate precedent. 
Nothing in law or history supports it. 
To start, consider Leader MCCON-
NELL’s own description of his work in a 
prior Senate impeachment proceeding. 
In the case of Judge Claiborne, after 
serving on the Senate trial committee, 
Leader MCCONNELL described how the 
Senate committee ‘‘labored intensively 
for more than 2 months, amassing the 
necessary evidence and testimony.’’ In 
the same essay, Leader MCCONNELL 
recognized the full body’s responsi-
bility for amassing and digesting evi-
dence. It was certainly a lot of evi-
dence for the Senate to amass and di-
gest in that proceeding, which involved 
charges against a district court judge. 
The Senate heard testimony from 19 
witnesses, and it allowed for over 2,000 
pages of documents to be entered into 
the record over the course of that trial. 
At no point did the Senate limit evi-
dence to what was before the House. It 
did the opposite, consistent with un-
broken Senate practice in every single 
impeachment trial—every single one. 
For example, of the 40 witnesses who 
testified during President Johnson’s 
Senate trial, only 3 provided testimony 
to the House during its impeachment 
inquiry—only 3. The remaining 37 wit-
nesses in that Presidential impeach-
ment trial testified before the Senate. 
Similarly, the Senate’s full first im-
peachment 
trial, 
which 
involved 
charges against Judge Pickering, in-
volved testimony from 11 witnesses, all 
of whom were new to the impeachment 
proceedings and had not testified be-
fore the House. 
There are many other examples of 
this point, including the Senate’s most 
recent impeachment trial of Judge 
Porteous in 2010. It is one that many of 
you and some of us know well. It, too, 
is consistent with this longstanding 
practice. There, the Senate heard testi-
mony from 26 witnesses, 17 of whom 
had not testified before the House dur-
ing its impeachment inquiry. 
Thus, there is a definitive tradition 
of the Senate hearing from new wit-
nesses when trying Articles of Im-
peachment. There has never been a rule 
limiting witnesses to those who ap-
peared in the House or limiting evi-
dence before the Senate to that which 
the House itself considered. As Senator 
Hiram Johnson explained in 1934, that 
is because the integrity of Senate im-
peachment trials depend heavily upon 
the witnesses who are called, their ap-
pearance on the stand, their mode of 
giving testimony. 
There is thus an unbroken history of 
witness testimony in Senate impeach-
ment trials, Presidential and judicial. I 
would argue, in the case of a President, 
it is even more important to hear the 
witnesses and see the documents. 
Any 
conceivable 
doubt 
on 
this 
score—and there should be none left—is 
dispelled by the Senate’s own rules for 
trial of impeachment. Obtaining docu-
ments and hearing live witness testi-
mony is so fundamental that the Rules 
of Procedure and Practice in the Sen-
ate When Sitting on Impeachment 
Trials, which date back to 19th cen-
tury, devote more attention to the 
gathering, handling, and admission of 
new evidence than any other single 
subject. These rules expressly con-
template that the Senate will hear evi-
dence and conduct a thorough trial 
when sitting as a Court of Impeach-
ment. At every turn, they reject the 
notion that the Senate would take the 
House’s evidentiary record, blind itself 
to everything else, and vote to convict 
or acquit. 
For example, rule VI says the Senate 
shall have the power to compel the at-
tendance of witnesses and enforce obe-
dience to its own orders. 
Rule VII authorizes the Presiding Of-
ficer to rule on all questions of evi-
dence, including, but not limited to, 
questions of relevancy, materiality, 
and redundancy. This rule, too, pre-
sumes that the Senate trial will have 
testimony, giving rise to such ques-
tions. 
Rule XI authorizes the full Senate to 
designate a committee of Senators to 
receive evidence and take testimony at 
such times and places as the com-
mittee may determine. As Rule XI 
makes clear, the committee’s report 
must be transmitted to the full Senate 
for final adjudication. But nothing here 
in the rules states: shall prevent the 
Senate from sending for any witness 
and hearing his testimony in open Sen-
ate or by order of the Senate involving 
the entire trial in the open Senate. 
Here, too, the Senate’s operative im-
peachment rules expressly contemplate 
and provide for subpoenaing witnesses 
and hearing their testimony as part of 
the Senate trial. 
And the list goes on. 
These rules plainly contemplate a ro-
bust role for the Senate in gathering 
and considering evidence. They reflect 
centuries of practice of accepting and 
requiring 
new 
evidence 
in 
Senate 
trials. This Senate should honor that 
practice today by rejecting this resolu-
tion. 
It will be argued: What about the 
Clinton trial? Even if we are departing 
from every other impeachment trial in 
history, including the impeachment of 
President Andrew Johnson, it will be 
argued: What about the Clinton trial? 
Aren’t we following the same process 
as in the Clinton trial? The answer is 
no. 
First, the process for the Clinton 
trial was worked out by mutual con-
sent among the parties. That is not 
true here, where the process is sought 
to be imposed by one party on the 
other. 
Second, all of the documents in the 
Clinton trial were turned over prior to 
the trial—all 90,000 pages of them—so 
they could be used in the House’s case. 
None of the documents have been 
turned over by the President in this 
case, and under Leader MCCONNELL’s 
proposal, none may ever be. They cer-
tainly will not be available to you or to 
us during most or all of the trial. If we 
are really going to follow the Clinton 
precedent, the Senate must insist on 
the documents now before the trial be-
gins. 
Third, the issue in the Clinton trial 
was not one of calling witnesses but of 
recalling witnesses. All of the key wit-
nesses in the Clinton trial had testified 
before the grand jury or had been inter-
viewed by the FBI—one of them, dozens 
of times—and their testimony was al-
ready known. President Clinton him-
self testified on camera and under oath 
before the Senate trial. He allowed 
multiple chiefs of staff and other key 
officials to testify, again, before the 
Senate trial took place. Here, none of 
the witnesses we seek to call—none of 
them—have testified or have been 
interviewed by the House. And, as I 
said, the President cannot complain 
that we did not call these witnesses be-
fore the House when their unavail-
ability was caused by the President 
himself. 
Last, as you will remember—those of 
you who were here—the testimony in 
the Clinton trial involved decorum 
issues that are not present here. You 
may rest assured, whatever else the 
case may be, such issues will not be 
present here. 
In sum, the Clinton precedent—if we 
are serious about it, if we are really se-
rious about modeling this proceeding 
after the Clinton trial—is one where all 
the documents had been provided up 
front and where all the witnesses had 
testified up front prior to the trial. 
That is not being replicated by the 
McConnell resolution—not in any way, 
not in any shape, not in any form. It is 
far from it. The traditional model fol-
lowed in President Johnson’s case and 
all of the others is really the one that 
is 
most 
appropriate 
to 
the 
cir-
cumstances. 
The Senate should address all the 
documentary issues and most of the 
witnesses now, not later. The need to 
subpoena documents and testimony 
now has only increased due to the 
President’s obstruction for several rea-
sons. 
First, his obstruction has made him 
uniquely and personally responsible for 
the absence of the witnesses before the 
House. Having ordered them not to ap-
pear, he may not be heard to complain 
now that they followed his orders and 
refused to testify. To do otherwise only 
rewards the President’s obstruction

and encourages future Presidents to 
defy lawful process in impeachment in-
vestigations. 
Second, if the President wishes to 
contest the facts—and his answer and 
trial brief indicate that he will try—he 
must not continue to deny the Senate 
access to the relevant witnesses and 
documents that shed light on the very 
factual matters he wishes to challenge. 
The Senate trial is not analogous to an 
appeal where the parties must argue 
the facts on the basis of the record 
below. There is no record below. There 
is no below. This is the trial. 
Third, the President must not be al-
lowed to mislead the Senate by selec-
tively introducing documents while 
withholding the vast body of docu-
ments that may contradict them. This 
is very important. The President must 
not be allowed to mislead you by intro-
ducing documents selectively and with-
holding all of the rest. All of the rel-
evant documents should be produced so 
there is full disclosure of the truth; 
otherwise, there is a clear risk that the 
President will continue to hide all evi-
dence harmful to his position, while se-
lectively producing documents without 
any context or opportunity to examine 
their creators. 
Finally, you may infer the Presi-
dent’s guilt from his continuing efforts 
to obstruct the production of docu-
ments and witnesses. The President 
has said he wants witnesses like 
Mulvaney and Pompeo and others to 
testify and that his interactions with 
Ukraine have been perfect. Counsel has 
affirmed today that would be the Presi-
dent’s defense: His conduct was perfect. 
It was perfect. It was perfectly fine to 
coerce an ally by withholding military 
aid to get help cheating in the next 
election. That will be part of the Presi-
dent’s defense, although albeit not 
worded in that way. 
Now he has changed course. He does 
not want his witnesses to testify. The 
logical inference in any court of law 
would be that the party’s continued ob-
struction of lawful subpoenas may be 
construed as evidence of guilt. 
Let me conclude. The facts will come 
out in the end. The documents which 
the President is hiding will be released, 
through the Freedom of Information 
Act or through other means over time. 
Witnesses will tell their stories in 
books and film. The truth will come 
out. 
The question is, Will it come out in 
time? And what answer shall we give if 
we did not pursue the truth now and let 
it remain hidden until it was too late 
to consider on the profound issue of the 
President’s guilt or innocence? 
There are many overlapping reasons 
for voting against this resolution, but 
they all converge on this single idea: 
fairness. 
The trial should be fair to the House, 
which has been wrongly deprived of 
evidence by a President who wishes to 
conceal it. It should be fair to the 
President, who will not benefit from an 
acquittal or dismissal if the trial is not 
viewed as fair, if it is not viewed as im-
partial. It should be fair to Senators, 
who are tasked with the grave respon-
sibility of determining whether to con-
vict or acquit and should do so with 
the benefit of all the facts. And it 
should be fair to the American people, 
who deserve the full truth and who de-
serve representatives who will seek it 
on their behalf. 
With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield 
back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, 
Mr. Sekulow, you have 57 minutes 
available. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, Leader 
MCCONNELL, and Democratic Leader 
SCHUMER, it is also my privilege to rep-
resent the President of the United 
States before this Chamber. 
Senator SCHUMER said earlier today 
that the eyes of the Founders are on 
these proceedings. Indeed, that is true, 
but it is the heart of the Constitution 
that governs these proceedings. 
What we just heard from Manager 
SCHIFF is that courts have no role; 
privileges don’t apply; and what hap-
pened in the past, we should just ig-
nore. In fact, Manager SCHIFF just tried 
to summarize my colleague’s defense of 
the President. He said it not in his 
words, of course, which is not the first 
time Mr. SCHIFF has put words into 
transcripts that did not exist. 
Mr. SCHIFF
also talked about a 
trifecta. I will give you a trifecta. Dur-
ing the proceedings that took place be-
fore the Judiciary Committee, the 
President was denied the right to 
cross-examine witnesses; the President 
was denied the right to access evi-
dence; and the President was denied 
the right to have counsel present at 
hearings. That is a trifecta—a trifecta 
that violates the Constitution of the 
United States. 
Mr. SCHIFF did say that the courts 
really don’t have a role in this. Execu-
tive privilege—why would that matter? 
It matters because it is based on the 
Constitution of the United States. One 
manager said it is you that is on trial: 
the Senate. He also said—and others 
did—that you are not capable of abid-
ing by your oath. 
Then we had the invocation of the 
ghost of the Mueller report. I know 
something about that report. It came 
up empty on the issue of collusion with 
Russia. There was no obstruction. In 
fact, the Mueller report, contrary to 
what these managers say today, came 
to the exact opposite conclusions of 
what they said. 
Let me quote from the House im-
peachment report at page 16: 
Although President Trump has at times in-
voked the notion of due process, an impeach-
ment trial, impeachment inquiry, is not a 
criminal trial and should not be confused 
with it. 
Believe me, what has taken place in 
these proceedings is not to be confused 
with due process because due process 
demands and the Constitution requires 
that fundamental parities and due 
process—we are hearing a lot about due 
process. Due process is designed to pro-
tect the person accused. 
When the Russia investigation failed, 
it devolved into the Ukraine, a quid pro 
quo. When that didn’t prove out, it was 
then 
bribery 
or 
maybe 
extortion. 
Somebody said—one of the Members of 
the House said treason. Instead, we get 
two Articles of Impeachment—two Ar-
ticles of Impeachment that have a 
vague allegation about a noncrime al-
legation of abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress. 
Members, managers—right here be-
fore you today—who have said that ex-
ecutive privilege and constitutional 
privileges have no place in these pro-
ceedings—on June 28, 2012, Attorney 
General Eric Holder became the first 
U.S. Attorney General to be held in 
both civil and criminal contempt. 
Why? Because President Obama as-
serted executive privilege. 
With respect to the Holder contempt 
proceedings, 
Mr. 
Manager 
SCHIFF 
wrote: ‘‘The White House assertion of 
privilege is backed by decades of prece-
dent that has recognized the need for 
the President and his senior advisers to 
receive candid advice and information 
from their top aides.’’ 
Indeed, that is correct—not because 
Manager SCHIFF said it but because the 
Constitution requires it. 
Mr. Manager Nadler said that the ef-
fort to hold Attorney General Holder in 
contempt for refusing to comply with 
various subpoenas was ‘‘politically mo-
tivated,’’ and Speaker PELOSI
called 
the Holder matter ‘‘little more than a 
witch hunt.’’ 
What are we dealing with here? Why 
are we here? Are we here because of a 
phone call or are we here before this 
great body because, as the President 
was sworn into office, there was a de-
sire to see him removed? 
I remember in the Mueller report 
there were discussions about—remem-
ber—insurance policies. The insurance 
policy didn’t work out so well, so then 
we moved to other investigations. I 
guess you would call them a reinsur-
ance or an umbrella policy. That didn’t 
work out so well, and here we are 
today. 
Manager SCHIFF quoted the Supreme 
Court, and I would like to make ref-
erence to the Supreme Court as well. It 
was then-Justice Rehnquist, later to be 
Chief Justice Rehnquist, who wrote for 
the majority in United States v. Rus-
sell in 1973. These are the words: ‘‘ . . . 
we may someday be presented with a 
situation in which the conduct of law 
enforcement agents is so outrageous 
that due process principles would abso-
lutely bar the government from invok-
ing judicial process to obtain a convic-
tion. . . . ’’ 
That day is today. That day was a 
year ago. That day was in July when 
Special Counsel Mueller testified. I am 
not today going to take the time to re-
view, but I will do it later, the patterns 
and practices of irregularities that 
have gone on in these investigations

from the outset; but to say that the 
courts have no role, the rush to im-
peachment, to not wait for a decision 
from a court on an issue as important 
as executive privilege—as if executive 
privilege hasn’t been utilized by Presi-
dents since our founding. This is not 
some new concept. We don’t waive ex-
ecutive privilege, and there is a reason 
we keep executive privilege and we as-
sert it when necessary, and that is to 
protect—to protect the Constitution 
and the separation of powers. 
The President’s opponents, in their 
rush to impeach, have refused to wait 
for a complete judicial review. That 
was their choice. Speaker PELOSI clear-
ly expressed her impatience and con-
tempt for judicial proceedings when 
she said: ‘‘We cannot be at the mercy 
of the courts.’’ Think about that for a 
moment. We cannot be at the mercy of 
the courts. 
So take article III of the U.S. Con-
stitution and remove it. We are acting 
as if the courts are an improper venue 
to determine constitutional issues of 
this magnitude? That is why we have 
courts. That is why we have a Federal 
judiciary. 
It was interesting when Professor 
Turley testified before the House Judi-
ciary Committee, in front of Mr. NAD-
LER’s committee. He said: 
We have three branches of government, not 
two. If you impeach a President and you 
make a high crime and misdemeanor out of 
going to courts an abuse of power, it’s your 
abuse of power. 
You know it is more than that. It is 
a lot more than that. There is a lot 
more than abuse of power if you say 
the courts don’t apply, constitutional 
principles don’t apply. 
Let’s start with a clean slate as if 
nothing happened. A lot has happened. 
As we proceed in the days ahead, we 
will lay out our case. We are going to 
put forward to the American people— 
but, more importantly, for the Con-
stitution’s sake—what is taking place 
here; that this idea that we should ig-
nore what is taking place over the last 
3 years is outrageous. 
We 
believe 
that 
what 
Senator 
MCCONNELL has put forward provides 
due process and allows the proceedings 
to move forward in an orderly fashion. 
Thirty-three 
days—thirty-three 
days—they held on to those impeach-
ment articles. Thirty-three days. It 
was such a rush for our national secu-
rity to impeach this President before 
Christmas that they then held them for 
33 days. To do what: to act as if the 
House of Representatives should nego-
tiate the rules of the U.S. Senate. They 
didn’t hide this. This was the expressed 
purpose. This was the reason they did 
it. 
We are prepared to proceed. Majority 
leader, Democratic minority leader, we 
are prepared to proceed. In our view, 
these proceedings should begin. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the rest of 
my time to my colleague, the White 
House Counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, I just want to make a couple 
of additional points. 
It is very difficult to sit there and 
listen to Mr. SCHIFF tell the tale he 
just told. Let’s remember how we all 
got here: They made false allegations 
about a telephone call. The President 
of the United States declassified that 
telephone call and released it to the 
public. How is that for transparency? 
When Mr. SCHIFF found out there was 
nothing to his allegations, he focused 
on the second telephone call. He made 
false and his colleagues made false al-
legations about that second telephone 
call that occurred before the one he 
had demanded. So the President of the 
United States declassified and released 
that telephone call. Still nothing. 
Again, complete transparency in a 
way that, frankly, I am unfamiliar 
with any precedent of any President of 
the United States releasing a classified 
telephone call with a foreign leader. 
When Mr. SCHIFF saw that his allega-
tions were false and he knew it any-
way, what did he do? He went to the 
House, and he manufactured a fraudu-
lent version of that call. He manufac-
tured a false version of that call. He 
read it to the American people, and he 
didn’t tell them it was a complete fake. 
Do you want to know about due proc-
ess? I will tell you about due process. 
Never before in the history of our coun-
try has a President of the United 
States been confronted with this kind 
of impeachment proceeding in the 
House. It wasn’t conducted by the Ju-
diciary Committee. Mr. NADLER, when 
he applied for that job, told his col-
leagues, when they took over the 
House, that he was really good at im-
peachment. 
But what happened was the pro-
ceedings took place in a basement of 
the House of Representatives. The 
President was forbidden from attend-
ing. The President was not allowed to 
have a lawyer present. 
In every other impeachment pro-
ceeding, the President has been given a 
minimal due process. Nothing here. 
Not even Mr. SCHIFF’s Republican col-
leagues were allowed into the SCIF. In-
formation was selectively leaked out. 
Witnesses were threatened. Good public 
servants were told that they would be 
held in contempt. They were told that 
they were obstructing. 
What does Mr. SCHIFF mean by ‘‘ob-
structing’’? He means that unless you 
do exactly what he says, regardless of 
your constitutional rights, then, you 
are obstructing. 
The President was not allowed to call 
witnesses. By the way, there is still 
evidence in the SCIF that we haven’t 
been allowed to see. I wonder why. No 
witnesses. 
Let’s think about something else for 
a second. Let’s think about something 
else. They held these articles for 33 
days. We hear all this talk about an 
overwhelming case—an overwhelming 
case that they are not even prepared 
today to stand up and make an opening 
argument about. That is because they 
have no case. Frankly, they have no 
charge. 
When you look at these Articles of 
Impeachment, they are not only ridicu-
lous; they are dangerous to our repub-
lic. And why? First of all, the notion 
that 
invoking 
your 
constitutional 
rights to protect the executive branch, 
that has been done by just about every 
President since George Washington— 
that is obstruction. 
That is our patriotic duty, Mr. 
SCHIFF, particularly when confronted 
with a wholesale trampling of constitu-
tional rights that I am unfamiliar with 
in this country. Frankly, it is the kind 
of thing that our State Department 
would criticize if we see it in foreign 
countries. We have never seen anything 
like it. 
And Mr. SCHIFF said: Have I got a 
deal for you. Abandon all your con-
stitutional rights, forget about your 
lawyers, and come in and do exactly 
what I say. 
No, thank you. No, thank you. 
And then has the temerity to come 
into the Senate and say: We have no 
use for courts. 
It is outrageous. 
Let me tell you another story. There 
is a man named Charlie Kupperman. He 
is the Deputy National Security Advi-
sor. He is the No. 2 to John Bolton. 
You have to remember that Mr. 
SCHIFF wants you to forget, but you 
have to remember how we got here. 
They threatened him. They sent him a 
subpoena. Mr. Kupperman did whatever 
any American should be allowed to do, 
used to be allowed to do. He was forced 
to get a lawyer. He was forced to pay 
for that lawyer, and he went to court. 
Mr. SCHIFF doesn’t like courts. He 
went to court. 
And he said: Judge, tell me what to 
do. I have obligations that, frankly, 
rise to what the Supreme Court has 
called the apex of executive privilege 
in the area of national security. And 
then I have a subpoena from Mr. 
SCHIFF. What do I do? 
You know what Mr. SCHIFF did? Mr. 
Kupperman went to the judge, and the 
House said: Never mind. We withdraw 
the subpoena. We promise not to issue 
it again. 
And then they come here and ask you 
to do the work that they refused to do 
for themselves. They ask you to tram-
ple on executive privilege. 
Would they ever suggest that the ex-
ecutive could determine on its own 
what the speech or debate Clause 
means? Of course not. Would they ever 
suggest the House could invade the dis-
cussions the Supreme Court has behind 
closed doors? I hope not. But they 
come here, and they ask you to do 
what they refuse to do for themselves. 
They had a court date. They with-
drew the subpoena. The evaded the de-
cision, and they are asking you to be-
come complicit in that evasion of the 
courts. It is ridiculous. We should call 
it out for what it is.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S385 
January 21, 2020 
Obstruction for going to court? It is 
an act of patriotism to defend the con-
stitutional rights of the President, be-
cause if they can do it to the President, 
they can do it to any of you and do it 
to any American citizen, and that is 
wrong. Laurence Tribe, who has been 
advising them—I guess he didn’t tell 
you that in the Clinton impeachment, 
it is dangerous to suggest that invok-
ing constitutional rights is impeach-
able. It is dangerous. 
You know what? It is dangerous, Mr. 
SCHIFF. 
What are we doing here? We have the 
House that completely concocted a 
process that we have never seen before. 
They lock the President out. By the 
way, will Mr. SCHIFF give documents? 
We asked them for documents. We 
asked them for documents when, con-
trary to his prior statements, it turned 
out that his staff was working with the 
whistleblower. 
We said: Let us see the documents; 
release them to the public. 
We are still waiting. 
The idea that they would come here 
and lecture the Senate—by the way, I 
was surprised to hear that. Did you re-
alize you are on trial? Mr. NADLER is 
putting you on trial. 
Everybody is on trial except for 
them. It is ridiculous. It is ridiculous. 
They said in their brief: We have 
overwhelming evidence. And they are 
afraid to make their case. Think about 
it. Think about it. It is common 
sense—overwhelming evidence to im-
peach the President of the United 
States. And then, they come here on 
the first day and say: You know what, 
we need some more evidence. 
Let me tell you something. If I 
showed up in any court in this country 
and said: Judge, my case is over-
whelming, but I am not ready to go 
yet; I need more evidence before I can 
make my case, I would get thrown out 
in 2 seconds. And that is exactly what 
should happen here. That is exactly 
what should happen here. 
It is too much to listen to almost— 
the hypocrisy of the whole thing. What 
are the stakes? What are the stakes? 
There is an election in almost 9 
months. Months from now, there is 
going to be an election. Senators in 
this body the last time had very wise 
words. They echoed the words of our 
Founders. ‘‘A partisan impeachment is 
like stealing an election.’’ That is ex-
actly what we have. 
Talk about the Framers’ worst night-
mare. It is a partisan impeachment 
they delivered to your doorstep, in an 
election year. Some of you are upset 
because you should be in Iowa right 
now, but, instead, we are here, and 
they are not ready to go. It is out-
rageous. It is outrageous. 
The American people will not stand 
for it. I will tell you that right now. 
They are not here to steal one election. 
They are here to steal two elections. It 
is buried in the small print of their ri-
diculous 
Articles 
of 
Impeachment. 
They want to remove President Trump 
from the ballot. They will not tell you 
that. They don’t have the guts to say it 
directly, but that is exactly what they 
are here to do. They are asking the 
Senate to attack one of the most sa-
cred rights we have as Americans—the 
right to choose our President in an 
election year. It has never been done 
before. It shouldn’t be done. 
The reason it has never been done is 
because no one ever thought that it 
would be a good idea for our country, 
for our children, for our grandchildren 
to try to remove a President from a 
ballot, to deny the American people 
the right to vote based on a fraudulent 
investigation conducted in secret with 
no rights. 
I could go on and on, but my point is 
very simple. It is long past time we 
start this so we can end this ridiculous 
charade and go have an election. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Jus-
tice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Does the Presi-
dent’s counsel yield back the remain-
der of their time? 
Mr. Manager NADLER. We do. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Demo-
cratic leader is recognized. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1284 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send an amendment to the desk to sub-
poena certain documents and records 
from the White House, and I ask that it 
be read. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
read the document. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHUMER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1284. 
(Purpose: To subpoena certain White House 
documents and records) 
At the appropriate place in the resolving 
clause, insert the following: 
SEC. lll. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this resolution, pursuant to 
rules V and VI of the Rules of Procedure and 
Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Im-
peachment Trials— 
(1) the Chief Justice of the United States, 
through the Secretary of the Senate, shall 
issue a subpoena to the Acting Chief of Staff 
of the White House commanding him to 
produce, for the time period from January 1, 
2019, to the present, all documents, commu-
nications, and other records within the pos-
session, custody, or control of the White 
House, 
including 
the 
National 
Security 
Council, referring or relating to— 
(A) all meetings and calls between Presi-

RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF 
THE CHAIR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate stand in recess subject to the call 
of the Chair. 
There being no objection, at 2:49 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 3:16 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the Chief Jus-
tice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. There are now 
2 hours of argument on Senator SCHU-
MER’s amendment. 
Mr. SCHIFF, do you wish to be heard 
on the amendment, and as the pro-
ponent or as the opponent? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, we wish to be heard and are a pro-
ponent of the amendment. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well. 
Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, we are an opponent of the 
amendment. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
you have an hour. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
In a moment, I will introduce House 
Manager LOFGREN from California to 
respond on the amendment, but I did 
want to take this opportunity, before 
certain 
representations 
became 
congealed, to respond to my colleagues’ 
argument on the resolution at large. 
First, it is worth noting they said 
nothing about the resolution. They 
said nothing about the resolution. 
They made no effort to defend it. They 
made no effort to even claim that this 
was like the Senate trial in the Clinton 
proceeding. They made no argument 
that, well, this is different here be-
cause of this or that. They made no ar-
gument about that whatsoever. They 
made no argument that it makes sense 
to try the case and then consider docu-
ments. They made no argument about 
why it makes sense to have a trial 
without witnesses. 
And why? Because it is indefensible. 
It is indefensible. No trial in America 
has ever been conducted like that, and 
so you heard nothing about it. And 
that should be the most telling thing 
about counsel’s argument. 
They had no defense of the McCon-
nell resolution because there is none. 
They couldn’t defend it on the basis of 
setting precedent. They couldn’t defend 
it on the basis of Senate history, tradi-
tionally. They couldn’t defend it on the 
basis 
of 
the 
Constitution. 
They 
couldn’t defend it at all. 
And so what did they say? Well, first 
they made the representation that the 
House is claiming there is no such 
thing as executive privilege. That is 
nonsense. No one here has ever sug-
gested there is no such thing as execu-
tive privilege, but the interesting thing 
here is they have never claimed execu-
tive privilege. Not once during the 
House investigation did they ever say 
that a single document was privileged 
or a single witness had something priv-
ileged to say. 
And why didn’t they invoke privi-
lege? Why are we now? And even now 
they haven’t quite invoked it? Why are 
we now? Why not in the House? 
Because in order to claim privilege, 
as they know, because they are good 
lawyers, you have to specify which doc-
ument, which line, which conversation, 
and they didn’t want to do that be-
cause to do that the President would 
have to reveal the evidence of his guilt. 
That is why they made no invocation 
of privilege. 
Now they make the further argument 
that the House should only be able to 
impeach after they exhaust all legal 
remedies, as if the Constitution says: 
The House shall have the sole power of 
impeachment, asterisk, but only after 
it goes to court in the district court, 
then the court of appeals, then the en 
banc, then the Supreme Court. Then it 
is remanded, and they go back up the 
chain, and it takes years. 
Why didn’t the Founders require the 
exhaustion of legal remedies? Because 
they didn’t want to put the impeach-
ment process in the courts. 
And you know what is interesting is 
that while these lawyers for the Presi-
dent are here before you today saying 
the House should have gone to court, 
they were in court saying the House 
may not go to court to enforce sub-
poenas. I kid you not. 
Other lawyers—maybe not the ones 
at this table—but other lawyers for the 
President are in court saying the exact 
opposite of what they are telling you 
today. They are saying: You cannot en-
force congressional subpoenas. That is 
nonjusticiable. You can’t do it. 
Counsel brings up the case involving 
Charles Kupperman, who was a deputy 
to John Bolton on the National Secu-
rity Council, and says: He did what he 
should do. He went to court to fight us. 
Well, the Justice Department took 
the position that he can’t do that. So 
these lawyers are saying he should, and 
then those lawyers are saying he 
shouldn’t. They can’t have it both 
ways. 
Now, 
interestingly, 
while 
Mr. 
Kupperman—Dr. Kupperman—went to 
court—and they applaud him for doing 
that—his boss, John Bolton, now says 
there is no necessity for him to go to 
court. He doesn’t have to do it. He is 
willing to come and talk to you. He is 
willing to come and testify and tell you 
what he knows. The question is, Do you 
want to hear it? Do you want to hear 
it? Do you want to hear from someone 
who was in the meetings, someone who 
described what the President did—this 
deal between Mulvaney and Sondland— 
as a drug deal? Do you want to know 
why it was a drug deal? Do you want to 
ask him why it was a drug deal? Do you 
want to ask him why he repeatedly 
told people: Go talk to the lawyers? 
You should want to know. They don’t 
want you to know. They don’t want 
you to know. The President doesn’t 
want you to know. 
Can you really live up to the oath 
you have taken to be impartial and not 
know? I don’t think you can. 
Now, they also made the argument 
that you will hear more later on from, 
apparently, Professor Dershowitz that, 
well, abuse of power is not an impeach-
able offense. It is interesting that they 
had to go outside the realm of con-
stitutional lawyers and scholars to a 
criminal defense lawyer to make that 
argument, because no reputable con-
stitutional law expert would do that. 
Indeed, the one they called in the 
House—that Republicans called in the 
House—Jonathan Turley, said exactly 
the opposite. There is a reason that 
Jonathan Turley is not sitting at the 
table, much to his dismay, and that is 
because he doesn’t support their argu-
ment. So they will cite him for one 
thing, but they will ignore him for the 
other. 
Now they say: Oh, the President is 
very transparent. He may have refused 
every subpoena, every document re-
quest, but he released two documents— 
the document on the July 25 call and 
the document on the April 21 call. 
Well, let’s face it. He was forced to 
release the record of the July 25 call 
when he got caught, when a whistle-
blower filed a complaint, when we 
opened an investigation. He was forced 
because he got caught. You don’t get 
credit for transparency when you get 
caught. And what is more, what is re-
vealed in that, of course, is damning. 
Now they point to the only other 
record he has apparently released, the

January 21, 2020 
April 21 call, and that is interesting 
too. Now, that is just a congratulatory 
call, but what is interesting about it is 
the President was urged on that call to 
bring up an issue of corruption. And, 
indeed, in the readout of that call the 
White House misleadingly said he did, 
but now that we have seen the record, 
we see that he didn’t. And notwith-
standing counsel’s claim in their trial 
brief that the President raised the 
issue of corruption in his phone call, 
the July 25 call, of course, that word 
doesn’t appear in either conversation. 
And why? Because the only corruption 
he cared about was the corruption that 
he could help bring about. 
Now, Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Sekulow 
made the representation that Repub-
licans were not even allowed in the 
depositions conducted in the House. 
Now, I am not going to suggest to you 
that Mr. Cipollone would deliberately 
make a false statement. I will leave to 
it Mr. Cipollone to make those allega-
tions against others. But I will tell you 
this: He is mistaken. He is mistaken. 
Every Republican on the three inves-
tigative committees was allowed to 
participate in the depositions, and, 
more than that, they got the same 
time we did. You show me another pro-
ceeding, another Presidential impeach-
ment or other that had that kind of ac-
cess for the opposite party. 
And, now, there were depositions in 
the Clinton impeachment. There were 
depositions in the Nixon impeachment. 
So what they would say is some secret 
process. Well, they were the same pri-
vate depositions in these other im-
peachments as well. 
Finally, on a couple last points, they 
made the argument that the President 
was not allowed, in the Judiciary Com-
mittee chaired by my colleague Chair-
man NADLER, to be present, to present 
evidence, to have his counsel present. 
That is also just plain wrong, just plain 
wrong. I am not going to suggest to 
you that they are being deliberately 
misleading here, but it is just plain 
wrong. 
You have also heard my friends at 
the other table make attacks on me 
and Chairman NADLER. You will hear 
more of that. I am not going to do 
them the dignity of responding to 
them, but I will say this. They make a 
very important point, although it is 
not the point I think they are trying to 
make. When you hear them attack the 
House managers, what you are really 
hearing is: We don’t want to talk about 
the President’s guilt. We don’t want to 
talk about the McConnell resolution 
and how patently unfair it is. We don’t 
want to talk about how—pardon the 
expression—ass-backward it is to have 
a trial and then ask for witnesses. And 
so they will attack House managers be-
cause maybe we can distract you for a 
moment from what is before you. 
Maybe if we attack House managers, 
you will be thinking about them in-
stead of thinking about the guilt of the 
President. 
So you will hear more of that, and 
every time you do, every time you hear 
them attacking House managers, I 
want you to ask yourself: Away from 
what issue are they trying to distract 
me? What was the issue that came up 
just before this? What are they trying 
to deflect my attention from? Why 
don’t they have a better argument to 
make on the merits? 
Finally, Mr. Sekulow asked: Why are 
we here? Why are we here? 
Well, I will tell you why we are here: 
Because the President used the power 
of his office to coerce an ally at war 
with an adversary, at war with Russia, 
used the powers of his office to with-
hold hundreds of millions of dollars of 
military aid that you appropriated and 
we appropriated to defend an ally and 
defend ourselves, because it is our na-
tional security as well. And why? To 
fight corruption? That is nonsense, and 
you know it. 
He withheld that money and he with-
held even meeting with him in the Oval 
Office—the President of Ukraine—be-
cause he wanted to coerce Ukraine into 
these sham investigations of his oppo-
nent that he was terrified would beat 
him in the next election. That is what 
this is about. 
You want to say that is OK? Their 
brief says that is OK. The President 
has a right to do it. Under article II, we 
heard the President can do whatever he 
wants. You want to say that is OK? 
Then you have got to say that every fu-
ture President can come into office and 
they can do the same thing. Are we 
prepared to say that? Well, that is why 
we are here. 
I now yield to Representative LOF-
GREN. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice, 
Senators, 
counsel 
for 
the 
President, the House managers strong-
ly support Senator SCHUMER’s amend-
ment, which would ensure a fair, legiti-
mate trial based on a full evidentiary 
record. 
The Senate can remedy President 
Trump’s 
unprecedented 
coverup 
by 
taking a straightforward step. It can 
ask for the key evidence that the 
President has improperly blocked. Sen-
ator SCHUMER’s amendment does just 
that. 
The amendment authorizes the sub-
poena for White House documents that 
are directly relevant to this case. 
These documents focus on the Presi-
dent’s scheme to strong-arm Ukraine 
to announce an investigation into his 
political opponent to interfere with the 
2020 election. 
The documents will reveal the extent 
of the White House’s coordination with 
the President’s agents, such as Ambas-
sador Sondland and Rudy Giuliani, who 
pushed the President’s so-called ‘‘drug 
deal’’ on Ukrainian officials. The docu-
ments will also show us how key play-
ers inside the White House, such as the 
President’s Acting Chief of Staff, Mick 
Mulvaney, and his deputy, Robert 
Blair, helped set up the deal by exe-
cuting the freeze on all military aid 
and withholding a promised visit to the 
White House. The documents include 
records of the people who may have ob-
jected to this scheme, such as Ambas-
sador Bolton. 
This is an important impeachment 
case against the President. The most 
important documents are going to be 
at the White House. The documents 
Senator SCHUMER’s amendment targets 
would provide more clarity and context 
about President Trump’s scheme. The 
amendment 
prevents 
the 
President 
from hiding evidence, as he has pre-
viously tried to do. 
The House subpoenaed these docu-
ments as part of the impeachment in-
quiry, but the President completely re-
jected this and every document subpoe-
naed from the House. As powerful as 
our evidence is—and make no mistake, 
it overwhelmingly proves his guilt—we 
did not receive a single document from 
the executive branch agency, including 
the White House itself. 
Recent revelations from press re-
ports, Freedom of Information Act re-
quests, and additional witnesses, such 
as Lev Parnas, underscore how rel-
evant these documents are and, there-
fore, why the President has been so 
desperate to hide them and his mis-
conduct from Congress and the Amer-
ican people. 
A trial without all the relevant evi-
dence is not a fair trial. It would be 
wrong for you Senators, acting as 
judges, to be deprived of relevant evi-
dence of the President’s offenses when 
you are judging these most serious 
charges. It would also be unfair to the 
American people, who overwhelmingly 
believe the President should produce 
all relevant documents and evidence. 
Now, documentary evidence is used 
in all trials for a simple reason. As the 
story goes, the documents don’t lie. 
Documents give objective real-time in-
sight into the events under investiga-
tion. The need for such evidence is es-
pecially important in Senate impeach-
ment trials. More than 200 years of 
Senate practice make clear that docu-
ments are generally the first order of 
business. They have been presented to 
the Senate before witnesses take the 
stand in great volume to ensure the 
Senate has the evidence it needs to 
evaluate the case. 
Documentary 
evidence 
in 
Senate 
trials has never been limited to the 
documents sent by the House. The Sen-
ate, throughout its existence, has exer-
cised its authority pursuant to its 
clear rules of procedure to subpoena 
documents at the outset of the trial. 
We don’t know with certainty what 
the documents will say. We simply 
want the truth, whatever that truth 
may be, and so do the American people. 
They want to know the truth, and so 
should everybody in this Chamber, re-
gardless of party affiliation. 
There are key reasons why this 
amendment is necessary. We will begin 
by walking through the history and 
precedent 
of 
Senate 
impeachment 
trials. I will let you know about the 
House’s efforts to get the documents, 
which were met by the President and

January 21, 2020 
his administration’s categorical com-
mitment to hide all the evidence at all 
costs, and we will address the specific 
need for these subpoenaed White House 
documents. I will tell you why these 
documents are needed now, not at the 
end of the trial, in order to ensure a 
full, fair trial based on a complete evi-
dentiary record. 
Someone suggested incorrectly that 
the Senate is limited only to evidence 
gathered before the House approved its 
Articles of Impeachment. Others have 
suggested, also incorrectly, that it 
would somehow be strange for the Sen-
ate to issue subpoenas. These claims 
are without any historical, preceden-
tial, or legal support. 
Over the past two centuries, the Sen-
ate has always understood that its sole 
power under the Constitution to try all 
impeachments requires the Senate to 
sit as a Court of Impeachment and hold 
a trial. In fact, the Founders assigned 
sole authority only twice in the Con-
stitution, first, giving the House sole 
authority to impeach, and, second, giv-
ing the Senate sole authority to try 
that impeachment. 
If the Founders had intended for the 
Senate to serve as some kind of appel-
late body, they would have said that. 
But, no, instead they wrote this in arti-
cle I, section 3: ‘‘The Senate shall have 
sole Power to try all Impeachments.’’ 
The Senate has always received the 
relevant documents in impeachment 
trials, and, indeed, the Senate’s own 
rules of procedure and practice make 
clear that new evidence will be consid-
ered. Precedent shows this. All 15 full 
Senate impeachment trials considered 
new evidence. 
Let’s look at a few examples that 
show the Senate takes new evidence in 
impeachment trials. 
The first-ever impeachment trial in 
1868 against President Andrew Johnson 
allowed the House managers to spend 
the first 2 days of the trial introducing 
new documentary evidence. 
It was the same in Judge John 
Pickering’s trial in 1804. New docu-
ments were presented to the Senate 
nearly a week before House managers 
made their opening statements and 
later throughout the trial. 
As has been mentioned earlier by Mr. 
SCHIFF, in modern times, in 2010, Judge 
Porteous’s impeachment trial included 
7 months of pretrial discovery and 6,000 
pages of documentary evidence admit-
ted at trial. After that evidence was 
admitted, the Senate held its trial. 
President Clinton’s case did not in-
volve subpoenas for documents. Why 
was that? Because President Clinton 
had already produced a huge trove of 
documents. The independent counsel 
turned over to Congress some 90,000 
pages of relevant documents gathered 
during the course of his years-long in-
vestigation, and I remember, as a mem-
ber of the Judiciary Committee, going 
over to the Ford building and looking 
at the boxes of the documents. But 
even with all those documents, the 
Clinton trial included the opportunity 
to present new evidence and submis-
sion of additional documents and three 
witnesses. 
The Clinton impeachment precedent 
also shows how President Trump’s re-
fusal to produce any relevant docu-
ments in response to congressional sub-
poenas is different from past Presi-
dents—different from President Clin-
ton, different from President Johnson, 
and less even than President Nixon. In 
short, not a single President has cat-
egorically refused to cooperate with an 
impeachment investigation. Not a sin-
gle President has issued a blanket di-
rection 
to 
his 
administration 
to 
produce no documents and no wit-
nesses. These are the precedents the 
Senate must rely on. 
The Senate should issue a subpoena 
for documents at the very outset of the 
proceedings so that this body, the 
House managers, the President can all 
account for those documents in their 
presentations and deliberations. 
It doesn’t make sense to request and 
receive documents after the parties 
present their cases. The time is now to 
do that. So why is the amendment 
needed to prevent President Trump 
from continuing his categorical com-
mitment to hide the evidence? 
In this case the House sought White 
House documents. Why don’t we have 
them? It is not because we didn’t try. 
It is because the White House refused 
to give them to us. The President’s de-
fense team seems to believe that the 
White House is permitted to com-
pletely refuse to provide any docu-
ments without regard to whether or 
not it is privileged. They apparently 
believe that Congress’s authority is 
subject to the approval of the Presi-
dent. But that is not what the Con-
stitution says. Our Constitution sets 
forth a democracy with a system of 
checks and balances to ensure that no 
one, and certainly not the President, is 
above the law. Even President Nixon 
produced more than 30 transcripts of 
White House recordings and notes in 
the meetings with the President. 
Here, even before the House launched 
the investigation that led to this trial, 
President Trump rejected Congress’s 
constitutional responsibility to use its 
lawful authority to investigate his ac-
tions. He asserted that his administra-
tion was fighting all the subpoenas, 
proclaiming: ‘‘I have an Article II, 
where I have the right to do whatever 
I want as President.’’ 
Here is what he said: ‘‘I have an Arti-
cle II, where I have the right to do 
whatever I want as President.’’ 
Even after the House formally an-
nounced its investigation of the Presi-
dent’s conduct in Ukraine, the Presi-
dent still continued his obstruction. 
Beginning on September 9, 2019, the 
House investigative committee made 
two attempts to voluntarily obtain 
documents from the White House. The 
White House refused to engage and, 
frankly, to even respond to the House 
committee. 
On October 4, the House Committee 
on Oversight Reform sent a subpoena 
to the White House Acting Chief of 
Staff, Mick Mulvaney, this time com-
pelling the production of documents 
from the White House by October 18. 
On October 8, before the White House 
documents were due, the White House 
Counsel sent a letter to Speaker 
PELOSI, stating the President’s position 
that President Trump and his adminis-
tration cannot participate in this par-
tisan inquiry under the circumstances. 
The President simply declared that he 
will not participate in an investigation 
he didn’t like. 
Ten days later, on October 18, the 
White House Counsel sent a letter to 
the House, confirming that it would 
continue 
to 
stonewall. 
The 
White 
House Counsel again stated that the 
President refused to participate. 
Well, the Constitution, article I, sec-
tion 2, says that the House will have 
the sole power of impeachment, just as 
in article I, section 3, the Senate has 
the sole power to try. Participation in 
a duly authorized congressional inves-
tigation isn’t optional. It is not up to 
the President to decide whether to par-
ticipate or not. The Constitution gives 
the House the sole power of impeach-
ment. It gives the Senate the sole 
power to try all impeachments. 
The President may not like being im-
peached, but if the President, not the 
Congress, decides when impeachment 
proceedings are appropriate, then the 
impeachment power is no power at all. 
If you let him block from Congress and 
from the American people the evidence 
to cover up his offenses, then the im-
peachment power truly will be mean-
ingless. 
With all the back-and-forth about 
these documents, we have heard the 
phrase 
‘‘executive 
privilege.’’ 
The 
President and his lawyers keep say-
ing—they talk about a vast legal right 
to justify hiding the truth, withholding 
information. But that is a distraction. 
That is not what the Constitution pro-
vides. 
The truth is, as has been mentioned 
by Mr. SCHIFF, in the course of the en-
tire impeachment inquiry, President 
Trump has not once asserted executive 
privilege—not a single time. It was not 
the reason provided by Mr. Cipollone 
for refusing to comply with the House 
subpoenas. Indeed, President Trump 
didn’t offer legal justification for with-
holding the evidence. 
Here is the truth. The President, 
Members of Congress, judges, and the 
Supreme 
Court 
have 
recognized 
throughout our Nation’s history that 
Congress’s investigative powers are at 
their absolute peak during impeach-
ment proceedings—your powers. Execu-
tive privilege cannot be a barrier to 
give absolute secrecy to cover up 
wrongdoing. If it did, the House and 
the Senate would see their powers dis-
appear. 
When President Nixon tried that ar-
gument by refusing to produce tape re-
cordings to prosecutors and to Con-
gress, he was soundly rebuked by the 
other two branches of government. The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S389 
January 21, 2020 
Supreme 
Court 
unanimously 
ruled 
against him. The House Judiciary Com-
mittee voted that he be impeached for 
obstruction of Congress. 
It would be remarkable for the 
United States Senate to declare for the 
first time in our Nation’s history that 
the President has an absolute right to 
decide whether his own impeachment 
trial is legitimate. It would be extraor-
dinary for the Senate to refuse to seek 
important documentary evidence, espe-
cially when the President has yet to 
assert any privilege to justify with-
holding documents. 
There is another reason this amend-
ment is important. The documents 
sought are directly relevant to the 
President’s 
misconduct. 
The 
White 
House is concealing documents involv-
ing officials who had direct knowledge 
of key events at the heart of this trial. 
This isn’t just a guess. We know these 
documents exist from the witnesses 
who testified in the House and from 
other public release of documents. 
Let’s walk through those specific 
documents 
that 
the 
White 
House 
should send to the Senate. They in-
clude, among other documents relating 
to President Trump, direct commu-
nications 
with 
President 
Zelensky; 
President Trump’s request for political 
investigations, including communica-
tions with Rudy Giuliani, Ambassador 
Sondland, 
and 
others; 
President 
Trump’s unlawful hold of the $391 mil-
lion of military aid; concerns that 
White House officials reported to NSC 
legal counsel in realtime; and the 
President’s decision to recall Ambas-
sador 
Marie 
Yovanovitch 
from 
Ukraine. 
The first set of documents the Senate 
should get about President Trump’s 
communication with the President of 
Ukraine would include the phone calls 
on April 21 and July 25, as well as the 
September 25, 2019, meeting with Presi-
dent Zelensky in New York. 
We know, for example, that NSC offi-
cials prepared talking points for the 
President in preparation for both calls 
to the Ukrainian President. The talk-
ing points were about American policy, 
as reflected by the votes of Congress, 
as well as the Trump administration 
itself. They didn’t include any mention 
of the Bidens or the 2016 election inter-
ference or investigations that Presi-
dent Trump requested on the July 25 
call. 
Here is a clip of Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman explaining how the President 
ignored the points about American pol-
icy reflecting the views of both the 
Congress and the Trump administra-
tion. 
[Text of Videotape presentation:] 
Mr. SCHIFF. Colonel Vindman, if I can 
turn your attention to the April 21 call that 
is the first call between President Trump 
and President Zelensky. Did you prepare 
talking points for the President’s use during 
that call? 
Colonel VINDMAN. Yes, I did. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Do those talking points in-
clude rooting out corruption in Ukraine? 
Colonel VINDMAN. Yes. 
Mr. SCHIFF. That was something the 
President was supposed to raise in the con-
versation with President Zelensky? 
Colonel VINDMAN. Those were the rec-
ommended talking points that were cleared 
through NSC staff for the President, yes. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. The mate-
rials provided for the July 25 call that 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman 
men-
tioned are highly relevant. They could 
help confirm that the President’s ac-
tual statements to President Zelensky 
were unrelated to the foreign policy ob-
jectives of his own administration and 
show that they served his own personal 
interest at the expense of America’s 
national security interest. 
These documents also include hand-
written notes and other documents 
that White House officials generated 
during the calls and meetings. We 
know, for example, that Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman, Mr. Morrison, and 
Jennifer Williams all testified to tak-
ing 
contemporaneous 
handwritten 
notes during the July 25 call. Ms. Wil-
liams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman 
both testified that President Zelensky 
made 
an 
exclusive 
reference 
to 
Burisma that was not included in the 
memorandum that the White House re-
leased to the public. Here is a clip of 
their testimony. 
[Text of Videotape presentation:] 
Mr. SCHIFF. Both of you recall President 
Zelensky in that conversation raising the 
issue or mentioning Burisma; do you not? 
Ms. WILLIAMS. That is correct. 
Colonel VINDMAN. Correct. 
Mr. SCHIFF. And yet the word ‘‘Burisma’’ 
appears nowhere in the call record that has 
been released to the public; is that right? 
Ms. WILLIAMS. That is right. 
Colonel VINDMAN. Correct. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Why do we 
need documents generated after the 
calls and meetings? They would shed 
light on how these events were per-
ceived in the White House and what ac-
tions were taken moving forward. For 
example, National Security Advisor 
John Bolton wasn’t on the 25th call, 
but he was apparently informed about 
the contents of the call afterward. His 
reaction, once he was informed, would 
be helpful to understanding the extent 
to which President Trump’s action de-
viated 
from 
American 
policy 
and 
American security interest. 
There is another set of documents 
that the Senate should get, and they 
relate to the political investigations 
that President Trump and his agents 
repeatedly asked Ukrainian officials to 
announce. These documents were about 
efforts to pressure Ukraine to an-
nounce investigations and the decision 
to place a hold on military aid to 
Ukraine. They would be very impor-
tant for you to evaluate the Presi-
dent’s conduct. 
For example, Ambassador Bolton is a 
firsthand witness to President Trump’s 
abuse of power. He reported directly to 
the President. He supervised the entire 
staff of the National Security Council. 
Public 
reports 
indicate 
that 
John 
Bolton is a voracious note-taker at 
every meeting. 
From witness testimony, we know 
that Ambassador Bolton hosted the 
July 10, 2019, meeting where Ambas-
sador Sondland told Ukrainian officials 
that the promised White House meet-
ing would be scheduled if they an-
nounce the investigations. We know 
Bolton was briefed about this meeting 
immediately following it when Ambas-
sador Sondland said he had a deal with 
Mick Mulvaney to schedule the prom-
ised White House meeting if Ukraine 
announced 
investigations 
into 
the 
Bidens in the 2016 election. 
We also know Ambassador Bolton 
was involved in briefing the President 
on 
a 
Presidential 
decision 
memo-
randum in August reflecting the con-
sensus interagency opinion that the 
Ukrainian security assessment was 
vital to America’s national security— 
something the Congress had approved 
appropriately and something the Presi-
dent had signed. 
Press reports indicate that he, too, 
was involved in the late August Oval 
Office meeting where he, Secretary 
Pompeo, and Secretary Esper all tried 
to convince the President to release 
the aid. 
Now, Ambassador Bolton has come 
forward and publicly confirmed that he 
was a witness to important events but 
also that he has new evidence that no 
one has seen yet. If we know there is 
evidence that has not yet come out, all 
of us should want to hear it. We should 
want to hear it now before Ambassador 
Bolton testifies. We should get docu-
ments and records relating to his testi-
mony, including his notes, which would 
provide 
contemporaneous 
evidence 
about what was discussed in meetings 
related to Ukraine, which would help 
to evaluate his testimony. 
The evidence is not restricted to just 
Ambassador Bolton. During his public 
testimony, 
Ambassador 
Gordon 
Sondland stated: I have not had access 
to all my phone records. He also said 
that he and his lawyers had asked re-
peatedly for these materials. He said 
the materials would help refresh his 
memory. We should go get that mate-
rial. 
Ambassador Sondland also testified 
that he exchanged a number of emails 
with top officials, like Mick Mulvaney, 
about his efforts to pressure Ukraine to 
announce the investigations President 
Trump demanded. Here is his testi-
mony. 
[Text of Videotape presentation:] 
Ambassador SONDLAND. First, let me say 
precisely, because we did not think that we 
were engaging in improper behavior, we 
made every effort to ensure that the relevant 
decision makers at the National Security 
Council and The State Department knew the 
important details of our efforts. The sugges-
tion that we were engaged in some irregular 
or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false. I have 
now identified certain State Department 
emails and messages that provide contem-
poraneous support for my view. These emails 
show that the leadership of the State De-
partment, the National Security Council, 
and the White House were all informed about 
the Ukraine efforts from May 23, 2019, until 
the security aid was released on September 
11, 2019.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S390 
January 21, 2020 
Ms. 
Manager 
LOFGREN. 
These 
emails referenced in this testimony are 
in the possession of the White House, 
the State Department, and even the 
Department of Energy since officials 
from all three entities communicated 
together. 
Now, during his testimony, Ambas-
sador Sondland described it this way: 
Everyone was in the loop. It was no se-
cret. 
These emails are therefore important 
to understanding the full scope of the 
scheme. 
A request for relevant evidence is not 
confined to Trump administration offi-
cials. The Senate should also get White 
House records relating to the Presi-
dent’s private agents who acted on his 
behalf in Ukraine, including Victoria 
Toensing and Joe diGenova. Witness 
testimony and documents have made 
clear that Mr. Giuliani, a frequent vis-
itor to the White House who also re-
ceived and made frequent calls to the 
White House, was acting on behalf of 
the President to press Ukrainian offi-
cials to announce investigations that 
would personally and politically ben-
efit the President. 
For example, the May 10, 2019, letter 
from Mr. Giuliani to President-elect 
Zelensky that is shown on this slide 
states he was acting ‘‘as personal coun-
sel to President Trump with his knowl-
edge and consent.’’ He requested a 
meeting with the President-elect, to be 
joined by Ms. Toensing, who is ‘‘very 
familiar with this matter.’’ The evi-
dence indicates he was collaborating 
with Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova in 
this effort. 
The Senate should get the White 
House records of the meeting and of 
the calls involving Mr. Giuliani, Ms. 
Toensing, 
or 
Mr. 
diGenova. 
These 
records are important to help you un-
derstand the extent to which the White 
House was involved in Mr. Giuliani’s 
efforts to coerce Ukraine to announce 
the investigation the President want-
ed. The records would also show how 
the President’s personal political agen-
da became more important than poli-
cies to help America’s national secu-
rity interests. 
The President’s counsel may—con-
sistent with his prior attempts to hide 
evidence—assert that attorney/client 
privilege would cover these documents, 
but the President’s personal attorney/ 
client privilege cannot shield evidence 
of misconduct in office or that of his 
aides or his lawyers’ participation in 
corrupt schemes. We aren’t asking for 
documents reflecting legitimate legal 
advice; we need documents about their 
actions to pressure Ukraine to an-
nounce an investigation into President 
Trump’s political opponent. 
There is a set of White House docu-
ments that relate directly to the Presi-
dent’s unlawful decision to withhold 
$391 million appropriated—bipartisan— 
to help Ukraine. Witnesses have testi-
fied that President Trump directly or-
dered a hold on the security assistance 
despite the unanimous opinion of these 
agencies that the aid should be re-
leased. 
Importantly, according to the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office, his ac-
tion violated the law. On January 16, 
2020, the GAO—an independent watch-
dog—issued a legal opinion finding that 
President Trump violated the law when 
he held up security assistance to 
Ukraine. The GAO said: 
Faithful execution of the law does not per-
mit the President to substitute his own pol-
icy priorities for those that Congress enacted 
into law. OMB withheld funds for a policy 
reason, which is not permitted under the Im-
poundment Control Act. The withholding 
was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we 
conclude that OMB violated the ICA. 
The fact that the President’s action 
to freeze the aid, which he used to pres-
sure Ukraine to announce the political 
investigations he wanted, was against 
not only the official consensus of his 
own administration but also against 
the law, and it was to help himself. 
That helps demonstrate these actions 
were taken for President Trump’s per-
sonal and political benefit. 
Witness testimony and public report-
ing made clear the White House has a 
significant body of documents that re-
late to these key aspects of the Presi-
dent’s scheme. Some of these docu-
ments outline the planning of the 
President’s freeze. 
For example, the New York Times re-
ported in June that Mr. Mulvaney 
emailed his senior adviser, Mr. Blair: 
Did we ever find out about the money 
for Ukraine and whether we can hold it 
back? This shows that Mr. Mulvaney 
was in email contact with his aides 
about the very issues under investiga-
tion as part of this impeachment. It 
tells us that the White House is in pos-
session of communications that go to 
the heart of the charges before you. 
The Senate should also get materials 
prepared for summary notes from the 
late August meeting with President 
Trump, Secretary of Defense Mark 
Esper, and Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo when they try to convince the 
President that ‘‘freeing up the money 
for Ukraine was the right thing to do.’’ 
According to the New York Times, Am-
bassador Bolton told the President this 
is in America’s interest. 
The Senate should review that highly 
relevant document, which reflects real- 
time assertions by President Trump’s 
own senior aides that Ukrainian aid 
was in the national security interest of 
the United States and that there was 
no legitimate reason to hold up the aid. 
There are documents that include 
after-the-fact justifications to try to 
overcome legal problems and the unan-
imous objections to freezing the assist-
ance to Ukraine, and we know these 
documents exist. 
On January 3, 2020, OMB stated in a 
letter to the New York Times that it 
had discovered 20 responsive documents 
consisting of 40 pages reflecting emails 
between White House official Robert 
Blair and OMB official Michael Duffey 
that relate directly to the freezing of 
the Ukraine security assistance. But 
OMB wouldn’t release them in a Free-
dom of Information lawsuit, and they 
have refused to produce these docu-
ments at the direction of the President 
in response to the House’s lawful sub-
poena. 
The Washington Post reported that a 
‘‘confidential White House review’’ of 
President Trump’s decision to hold up 
‘‘hundreds of documents that reveal ex-
tensive efforts to generate an after-the- 
fact justification for the . . . debate 
over whether the delay was legal’’— 
that is known as a coverup, actually. 
The White House lawyers had, appar-
ently, uncovered ‘‘early August email 
exchanges between acting chief of staff 
Mick Mulvaney and White House budg-
et officials seeking to provide some ex-
planation for withholding the funds the 
president had already ordered a hold’’ 
on. 
The documents also reportedly in-
clude communications between White 
House officials and outside agencies. 
Not only does Congress have a right to 
see them, but the public does, too, 
under freedom of information laws. 
As a matter of constitutional author-
ity, the Senate has the greatest inter-
est in and the right to compel those 
documents. Indeed, as the news article 
explains, White House lawyers are re-
portedly worried about ‘‘unflattering 
exchanges and facts that could at a 
minimum embarrass the president.’’ 
Perhaps they should be worried about 
that, but the risk of embarrassment 
cannot outweigh the constitutional in-
terests 
in 
this 
impeachment 
pro-
ceeding. 
Any evidence of guilt, including fur-
ther proof of the real reason the Presi-
dent ordered the funds withheld, or 
after-the-fact attempts to paper over 
knowingly unlawful conduct, must be 
provided to ensure a full and fair trial. 
No privilege or national security ra-
tionale can be used as a shield from 
disclosing misconduct. 
There are key White House docu-
ments relating to multiple instances 
when White House officials reported 
their concerns to White House lawyers 
about the President’s scheme to press 
Ukraine to do the President a domestic 
political favor. For example, Lieuten-
ant Colonel Vindman and Dr. Hill both 
informed NSC lawyers about the July 
10 
meeting 
in 
which 
Ambassador 
Sondland revealed he had a deal with 
Mr. Mulvaney. 
I am going to go directly to the clip 
by Dr. Hill because, at Bolton’s direc-
tion, Dr. Hill also reported that meet-
ing to John Eisenberg, as she explained 
in her testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. HILL. I had a discussion with Ambas-
sador Bolton both after the meeting in his 
office, a very brief one, and then one imme-
diately afterward, the subsequent meeting. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. So the subsequent meet-
ing—after both meetings when you spoke to 
him and relayed to him what Ambassador 
Sondland said, what did Ambassador Bolton 
say to you? 
Ms. HILL. Well, I just want to highlight, 
first of all, that Ambassador Bolton wanted

me to hold back in the room immediately 
after the meeting. Again, I was sitting on 
the sofa with a colleague— 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Right. But just in that 
second meeting, what did he say? 
Ms. HILL. Yes, but he was making a very 
strong point that he wanted to know exactly 
what was being said. And when I came back 
and related it to him, he had some very spe-
cific instruction for me. And I’m presuming 
that that’s— 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What was that specific in-
struction? 
Ms. HILL. The specific instruction was 
that I had to go to the lawyers—to John 
Eisenberg, the senior counsel for the Na-
tional Security Council, to basically say: 
You tell Eisenberg Ambassador Bolton told 
me that I am not part of this—whatever drug 
deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cook-
ing up. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What did you understand 
it to mean by the drug deal that Mulvaney 
and Sondland were cooking up? 
Ms. HILL. I took it to mean investigations 
for a meeting. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you go speak to the 
lawyers? 
Ms. HILL. I certainly did. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And you relayed every-
thing that you just told us and more? 
Ms. HILL. I relayed it, precisely, and then 
more of the details of how the meeting had 
unfolded, as well, which I gave a full descrip-
tion of this in my October 14 deposition. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. There was 
something wrong going on here, and 
White House officials were told repeat-
edly: Go tell the lawyers about it—Dr. 
Hill, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, and 
Mr. Morrison, who reported to Mr. 
Eisenberg at least two conversations. 
We need the notes of those documents 
to find out what was said. Again, attor-
ney-client privilege cannot shield in-
formation about misconduct from the 
impeachment trial of the President of 
the United States. 
It is interesting. This amendment is 
supported by 200 years of precedent. It 
is needed to prevent the President from 
continuing to hide the evidence, and 
that is why the specific documents re-
quested are so important for this case. 
It is faithful to the Constitution’s pro-
vision that the Senate shall have the 
sole power to try all impeachments. 
The final point I will make today 
concerns urgency. The Senate should 
act on this subpoena now, at the outset 
of the trial. In 14 of the Senate’s 15 full 
impeachment 
trials, 
threshold 
evi-
dentiary matters, including the timing, 
nature, and scope of witness testimony, 
and the gathering of all relevant docu-
ments, were addressed at the very out-
set of the trial. There are practical 
considerations as to why the subpoenas 
need to be issued now. Resolving 
whether a subpoena should issue now 
would let us immediately engage with 
the White House to resolve asserted le-
gitimate privilege issues, if any exist, 
and ensure you get the documents as 
soon as possible so they can be pre-
sented to the Senators in advance of 
witness testimony. Waiting to resolve 
these threshold matters until after the 
parties have presented their case would 
undercut the process of a genuine cred-
ible trial. 
Thus, common sense, tradition, and 
fairness all compel that the amend-
ment should be adopted, and it should 
be adopted now. 
Members of the Senate, for all of the 
reasons I have walked through today, I 
urge you to support the amendment to 
issue a subpoena for White House docu-
ments—documents that are directly 
relevant to evaluating the President’s 
scheme. 
The House did its job. In the face of 
the President’s obstruction and cat-
egorical commitment to hide the evi-
dence, we still gathered direct evidence 
of his conduct and determined that his 
conduct required impeachment. 
The President complains about due 
process in the House investigation. But 
he was not only permitted to partici-
pate; he was actually required to par-
ticipate. Yet he refused to do so. He re-
fused to provide witnesses and docu-
ments that would tell his side of the 
story. So now it is up to you. 
With the backing of a subpoena, au-
thorized by the Chief Justice of the 
United States, you can end President 
Trump’s obstruction. If the Senate 
fails to take this step, if it will not 
even ask for this evidence, this trial 
and your verdict will be questioned. 
Congress and the American people 
deserve the full truth. There is no plau-
sible reason why anyone wouldn’t want 
to hear all of the available evidence 
about the President’s conduct. 
It is up to this body to make sure 
that happens. It is up to you to decide 
whether the Senate will affirm its sole 
power and constitutional duty to try 
impeachments and whether and when 
it will get the evidence that it needs to 
render a fair verdict. Don’t surrender 
to the President’s stonewalling. It will 
allow the President to be above the law 
and deprive the American people of 
truth in the process. 
A fair trial is essential in every way. 
It is important for the President, who 
hopes to be exonerated, not merely ac-
quitted by a trial seen as unfair. It is 
important for the Senate, whose vital 
role is to continue to protect and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States, which has preserved our Amer-
ican liberty for centuries. And, finally, 
it is important for the American peo-
ple, who expect a quest for truth, fair-
ness, and justice. 
History is watching, and the House 
managers urge that you support the 
amendment. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Patrick Philbin will present 
our opposition. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well. 
Mr. Philbin. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you. 
Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL, Democratic Leader SCHU-
MER, and Senators, it is remarkable 
that after taking the action of the 
breathtaking gravity of voting to im-
peach the duly elected President of the 
United States and after saying for 
weeks that they had overwhelming evi-
dence to support their case, the first 
thing that the House managers have 
done upon arriving, finally, at this 
Chamber, after waiting for 33 days, is 
to say: Well, actually, we need more 
evidence. We are not ready to present 
our case. We need to have subpoenas, 
and we need to do more discovery be-
cause we don’t have the evidence we 
need to support our case. 
This is stunning. It is a stunning ad-
mission of the inadequate and broken 
process that the House Democrats ran 
in this impeachment inquiry that 
failed to compile a record to support 
their charges. It is stunning that they 
don’t have the evidence they need to 
present their case and that they don’t 
really have a case. 
If a litigant showed up in any court 
in this country on the day of trial and 
said to the judge, ‘‘Actually, Your 
Honor, we are not ready to go; we need 
more discovery; we need to do some 
more subpoenas; we need to do some 
more work,’’ they would be thrown out 
of court, and the lawyers would prob-
ably be sanctioned. This is not the sort 
of proceeding that this body should 
condone. 
We have just heard that this is so im-
portant. Let’s consider what is really 
at issue in the resolution here and the 
amendment. It is a matter of timing. It 
is a matter of when this body will con-
sider whether there should be witnesses 
or subpoenas for documents. 
Why is it that the House managers 
are so afraid to have to present their 
case? Remember, they have had weeks 
of a process that they entirely con-
trolled. They had 17 witnesses who tes-
tified first in secret and then in public. 
They have compiled a record with 
thousands of pages of reports, and they 
are apparently afraid to just make a 
presentation based on the record that 
they compiled and then have you de-
cide whether there is any ‘‘there’’ 
there—whether there is anything worth 
trying to talk to more witnesses about. 
Why is it that they can’t wait a few 
days to make their presentation on ev-
erything they have been preparing for 
weeks and then have that issue consid-
ered? It is because they don’t think 
there is any ‘‘there’’ there, and they 
want to ram this through now. They 
want to ram this through now when it 
is something that they, themselves, 
failed to do. 
I want to unpack a couple of aspects 
of what they are asking this body to 
do. Part of it relates to the broken 
process in the House and how that 
process was inadequate and invalid and 
compiled an inaccurate record, and 
part of it has to do with what accept-
ing their request to have this body do 
their job for them would do to this in-
stitution going forward and how it 
would forever alter the relationship be-
tween the House and the Senate in im-
peachment proceedings. 
First, as to the process in the House. 
What the House managers are asking 
this body to do now is to really do

their job for them because they didn’t 
take the measures to pursue these doc-
uments 
in 
the 
House 
proceedings. 
There have been a number of state-
ments made that they tried to get the 
documents and no executive privilege 
was asserted, and things like that. 
Let’s look at what actually hap-
pened. 
They issued a subpoena to the White 
House, and the White House explained. 
And we were told a few minutes ago 
that the White House provided no re-
sponse, provided no rationale. That is 
not true. In a letter of October 18, 
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone ex-
plained in three pages of legal argu-
ment why that subpoena was invalid. 
That subpoena was invalid because it 
was issued without authorization. 
We have heard a lot today about how 
the Constitution assigns the sole power 
of impeachment to the House. That is 
right. That is what article I, section 2, 
says, that it assigns the sole power of 
impeachment to the House, not to any 
Member of the House. And no com-
mittee of the House can exercise that 
authority to issue subpoenas until it 
has been delegated that authority by a 
vote of the House. There was no vote 
from 
the 
House. 
Instead, 
Speaker 
PELOSI held a press conference, and she 
purported, by holding a press con-
ference on September 24, to delegate 
the authority of the House to Manager 
SCHIFF and several other committees 
and have them issue subpoenas. All of 
those subpoenas were invalid. That was 
explained to the House, to Manager 
SCHIFF, and the other chairmen of the 
committees at the time in that October 
18 letter. 
Did the House take any steps to rem-
edy that? Did they try to dispute that? 
Did they go to court? Did they do any-
thing to resolve that problem? No, be-
cause, as we know, all that they want-
ed to do was issue a subpoena and move 
on. They just wanted to get through 
the impeachment process as quickly as 
possible and get it done before Christ-
mas. That was their goal. So those sub-
poenas were unauthorized. 
Now, what about some of the other 
things they brought up: the witnesses, 
the witnesses who were directed not to 
testify. In part on this, we have heard 
Manager SCHIFF say several times that 
the White House never asserted execu-
tive privilege. Well, let me be clear on 
that. That is a lawyer’s trick because 
it is technically true that the White 
House didn’t assert executive privilege 
because there is a particular situation 
in which you do that and a particular 
way that you do that. 
There is another doctrine of immu-
nity of senior advisers to the President 
that is based on the same principles as 
executive privilege, and that has been 
asserted by Presidents of both political 
parties since the 1970s at least. 
This is what one Attorney General 
explained about that: ‘‘ . . . the immu-
nity such advisers enjoy from testi-
monial compulsion by a congressional 
committee is absolute and may not be 
overborne by competing congressional 
interests.’’ 
That was Attorney General Janet 
Reno in the Clinton administration ex-
plaining that senior advisers to the 
President are immune from congres-
sional compulsion. That doctrine, that 
immunity, is rooted in the same prin-
ciples of executive privilege that has 
been asserted by all Presidents since 
the 1970s, and that was the basis on 
which a number of these advisers 
whose pictures they put up were di-
rected not to testify. 
Did they try to challenge that in-
quiry? Did they go to court on that 
one? Did they try to go through the 
constitutionally 
mandated 
accom-
modations process to see if there was a 
way to come up with some aspect of 
testimony to be provided? No, none of 
that. They just wanted to forge ahead, 
rush through the process, not have the 
evidence, and then use that as another 
charge in their charging sheet for the 
impeachment, calling it obstruction of 
Congress. 
And what that is, as Professor Turley 
explained, is this idea that, when there 
is a conflict between the executive 
branch and the House in seeking infor-
mation and the President is asserting 
constitutionally based privileges, that 
is part of the operation of separation of 
powers. That is the President’s con-
stitutional duty to defend the preroga-
tives of the office for the future occu-
pants of that office. It is not something 
that can be charged as an impeachable 
offense, as the House Democrats have 
tried to say here. To do that is an 
abuse of power. That is what Professor 
Turley explained. It is Congress’s—it is 
the House Democrats’ abuse of power. 
We just heard Manager LOFGREN 
refer to executive privilege as a dis-
traction. She was asserting that these 
issues of executive privilege are just a 
distraction that shouldn’t hold things 
up. This is what the Supreme Court has 
said about executive privilege in Nixon 
v. United States; that the protections 
for confidentiality and executive privi-
lege are ‘‘fundamental to the oper-
ations of government and inextricably 
rooted in the separation of powers 
under the Constitution.’’ 
Inextricably rooted in the separation 
of powers. That is why it is the Presi-
dent’s duty to defend executive branch 
confidentiality and interests, and that 
is what the President was doing here. 
Now, the process they pursued in the 
House abandoned any effort beyond 
issuing the first subpoena that was in-
valid to work out an accommodation 
with the White House and, instead, just 
tried to rush ahead to have the im-
peachment done by Christmas. What 
does that lead to now? They are com-
ing to this body after a process that 
was half-baked, that didn’t compile 
records sufficient to support their 
charges, and asking this body to do 
their job for them. 
Now, as Leader MCCONNELL pointed 
out in some comments earlier today, to 
allow that, to accept the idea that the 
House can bring in an impeachment 
here that is not adequately supported, 
that has not been investigated, that 
has not got a record to support it, and 
turn this body into the investigatory 
body would permanently alter the rela-
tionship between the House and the 
Senate in impeachment proceedings. It 
is not the role of the Senate to have to 
do the House’s job for them. It is not 
the role of the Senate to be doing an 
investigation and to be doing discovery 
in a matter like the impeachment of a 
President of the United States. If the 
House has not done the investigation 
and cannot support its case, it is not 
the time, once it arrives here, to start 
doing all that work. That is something 
that is the House’s role. 
So this is something that is impor-
tant for this institution, I believe, not 
to allow the House to turn it into a sit-
uation where this body would have to 
be doing the House’s work for it. If 
there is not evidence to support the 
case, if they haven’t done their inves-
tigation, then they are not going to be 
able to support their case. 
Again, what is at issue here—and I 
think it is important to recall—on the 
issue of this amendment, is not wheth-
er the Senate, whether this body, will 
be considering whether there should be 
witnesses or not but when that should 
be considered. There is no reason not 
to take the approach that was done in 
the Clinton impeachment. One hundred 
Senators agreed then that it made 
sense to hear from both sides before 
making determination on that, to hear 
from both sides to see what sort of case 
the House could present and the Presi-
dent’s defense. 
That makes sense. In every trial sys-
tem there is a mechanism for deter-
mining whether the parties have actu-
ally presented a triable issue, whether 
there is really some ‘‘there’’ there that 
requires the further proceedings. This 
body should take that commonsense 
approach and hear what it is that the 
House managers have to say. 
Why are they afraid to present their 
case? They had weeks in a process that 
they 
controlled 
to 
compile 
their 
record, and they should be able to 
make that presentation now. 
The one point that I will close on is 
we heard Manager SCHIFF say several 
times that we have to have a fair proc-
ess here. I was struck by it that at one 
point he said, if you allow only one side 
to present evidence, the outcome will 
be predetermined. The outcome will be 
predetermined. 
That is exactly what happened in the 
House. Let’s recall that the process 
they had in the House was one-sided. 
They locked the President and his law-
yers out. There was no due process for 
the President. They started in secret 
hearings in the basement. The Presi-
dent couldn’t be present or, by his 
counsel, he couldn’t present evidence. 
He couldn’t cross-examine the wit-
nesses. Then there was a second round 
in public where, again, they locked the 
President out.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S393 
January 21, 2020 
We have heard—and they just said 
that the President had an opportunity 
to participate in the third round of 
hearings that they held before the Ju-
diciary Committee. After one hearing 
on December 4, Speaker PELOSI, on the 
morning of December 5, went out and 
announced the conclusion of the Judi-
ciary Committee proceedings. She an-
nounced that she was directing Chair-
man NADLER to draft Articles of Im-
peachment. That was before the day 
they had set for the President to even 
tell them what rights he wanted to 
have and to exercise in their pro-
ceedings. 
It was all already predetermined. The 
outcome had been predetermined. The 
Judiciary Committee had already de-
cided it was not going to have any fact 
hearings. There was no process for the 
President. He was never allowed to par-
ticipate. 
So when Chairman SCHIFF says here 
that, if you only allow one side to 
present evidence, that predetermines 
the outcome, that is what they did in 
the House because they had a predeter-
mined outcome there, because it was 
all one-sided. For him to lecture this 
body now on what a fair process would 
be takes some gall. A fair process 
would be, when you come to the day of 
trial, be ready to start the trial and 
present your case and not ask for more 
discovery. 
The President is ready to proceed. 
The House managers should be ready to 
proceed. 
This amendment should be rejected. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House 
managers have 8 minutes remaining. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice, the House is certainly not ask-
ing the Senate to do the House’s job. 
We are asking the Senate to do its job, 
to hold the trial. Have you ever heard 
of a trial that doesn’t have evidence, 
that doesn’t have witnesses? That is 
what this amendment is all about. 
Just a moment about the subpoenas. 
The President—President Trump—re-
fused to provide any information to the 
House, ordered all of his people to 
stonewall us. Now, it has been sug-
gested that we should spend 2 or 3 
years litigating that question. I was a 
young law student—actually working 
on 
the 
Nixon 
impeachment—many 
years ago, and I remember the day the 
Supreme Court issued its unanimous 
decision that the President had to re-
lease the tapes. I think United States 
v. Nixon still governs the President. 
The House and the Senate should not 
be required to litigate United States v. 
Nixon back in the Supreme Court and 
down again for it to be good law. It is 
good law. The President has not com-
plied with those requirements, to the 
detriment of the truth. 
This isn’t about helping the House. 
This isn’t about helping the Senate. 
This is about getting to the truth and 
making sure that impartial justice is 
done and that the American people are 
satisfied that a fair trial has been held. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I would yield now 
to my colleague Mr. SCHIFF. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Mr. Philbin says that the House is 
not ready to present its case. Of course, 
that is not something you heard from 
any of the managers. We are ready. 
The House calls John Bolton. The 
House calls John Bolton. The House 
calls Mick Mulvaney. Let’s get this 
trial started, shall we? We are ready to 
present our case. We are ready to call 
our witnesses. The question is, Will 
you let us? That is the question before 
us. 
Mr. Philbin says: Well, if I showed up 
in court and said I wasn’t ready, the 
judge would throw me out of the court. 
Of course, we are not saying we aren’t 
ready. You know what would happen if 
Mr. Philbin went into a court and the 
judge said: I have made a deal with the 
defendant. I am not going to let the 
prosecutor call any witnesses. I am not 
going to let the prosecutor present any 
documents. 
You know who would get thrown out 
of court? The judge. The judge would 
be taken out in handcuffs. 
So let’s step out of this body for a 
moment and imagine what a real trial 
would look like. It would begin with 
the government receiving documents, 
being able to introduce documents, and 
being able to call witnesses. This trial 
should be no different. 
Mr. Philbin makes reference to the 
Cipollone letter on October 18, which 
followed a Cipollone eight-page letter 
on October 8, saying: We are not going 
to do anything you ask. 
Part law, part diatribe. Mostly dia-
tribe. You should read it. It is a letter, 
basically, that says what the President 
said on that TV screen, which is we are 
going to fight all subpoenas. 
The doctrine of absolute immunity 
that counsel refers to has, yes, been in-
voked or at least attempted by Presi-
dents of both parties and rejected uni-
formly by the courts, including the 
most recent decision involving Don 
McGahn, the President’s former White 
House Counsel, where the court said: 
That would make him a King. He is no 
King, and this trial has determined 
that he shall not become a King, ac-
countable to no one, answerable to no 
one. 
What is more, this idea of absolute 
immunity, this fever dream of Presi-
dents of both parties, it has no applica-
tion to documents. Again, this amend-
ment is on documents. There is no ab-
solute immunity from providing docu-
ments. 
As Representative LOFGREN
illus-
trated, when this case has gone to the 
Supreme Court, in the Nixon case, the 
Court held that the interest and con-
fidentiality in an impeachment pro-
ceeding must give way to the interests 
of the truth and the Senate and the 
American people. 
You cannot invoke privilege to pro-
tect wrongdoing. You cannot invoke 
privilege to protect evidence of a con-
stitutional crime like we have here. 
Finally, with respect to those secret 
hearings that counsel keeps referring 
to, those secret depositions in the 
House were so secret that only 100 
Members of Congress were able to be 
there and participate—only 100. That is 
how secret that Chamber was. 
Imagine that, in the grand jury pro-
ceedings in the Clinton investigation 
or in the Jaworski and the Nixon inves-
tigation—imagine inviting 50 or 100 
Members of Congress to sit in on those. 
Imagine, as the President would like 
here, apparently, the President insist-
ing on having his lawyer in the grand 
jury because it was a case being inves-
tigated against him. 
We had no grand jury here. Why is 
that? Why did we have no grand jury 
here? Why was there no special pros-
ecutor here? Because the Justice De-
partment said they are not going to 
look into this. Bill Barr’s Justice De-
partment said there is nothing to see 
here. If it were up to that Justice De-
partment, you wouldn’t know anything 
about this. That is why there was no 
grand jury. That is why we, and the 
House, had to do the investigative 
work ourselves, and, yes, just like in 
the Nixon case, just like in the Clinton 
case, we used depositions. 
Do you know what deposition rules 
we used, those terribly unfair deposi-
tion rules we used? They were written 
by the Republicans. We used the same 
rules that the GOP House Members 
used. That is how terribly unfair they 
were. 
My gosh, they used our rules. How 
dare they? How dare they? 
Why do we do depositions? Because 
we didn’t want one witness to hear 
what another witness was saying so 
they could either tailor their stories or 
know they just had to admit so much 
and no more. It is how every credible 
investigation works. 
Counsel can repeat all they like that 
the President didn’t have a chance to 
participate, didn’t have a chance to 
have counsel present in the Judiciary 
Committee or to offer evidence. They 
can say it as much as they like, but it 
does not make it any more true when 
they make the same false representa-
tions time and again. It makes it that 
much more deliberate and onerous. 
The President could have presented 
evidence in the Judiciary Committee. 
He chose not to. There is a reason for 
that. There is a reason why the wit-
nesses they have talked about aren’t 
material witnesses. They don’t go to 
the question of whether the President 
withheld the aid for this corrupt pur-
pose. They don’t go to any of that, be-
cause they have no witnesses to ab-
solve the President on the facts. 
You should want to see these docu-
ments. You should want to see them. 
You should want to know what these 
private emails and text messages have 
to say. If you are going to make a 
guess about the President’s guilt or in-
nocence, if you are going to make a de-
cision about whether he should be re-
moved from office, you should want to 
see what these documents say.

If you don’t care, if you have made 
up your mind—he is the President of 
my party or, for whatever reason, I am 
not interested, and what is more, I 
don’t really want the country to see 
this—that is a totally different matter, 
but that is not what your oath re-
quires. It is not what your oath re-

partial justice, which means to see the 
evidence—to see the evidence. That is

RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF 
THE CHAIR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate stand in recess subject to the call 
of the Chair. 
There being no objection, at 4:48 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 5:16 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amend-
ment is arguable by the parties for 2 
hours equally divided. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF, are you a pro-
ponent or an opponent? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Proponent, 
Mr. Chief Justice.

The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
you have an hour, and you will be able 
to reserve time for rebuttal. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Chief Jus-
tice Roberts, Senators, counsel for the 
White House, I am VAL DEMINGS from 
the State of Florida. 
The House managers strongly sup-
port the amendment to issue a sub-
poena for documents to the State De-
partment. 
As we explained, the first Article of 
Impeachment charges the President 
with using the power of his office to so-
licit and pressure Ukraine to announce 
investigations that everyone in this 
Chamber knows to be bogus. The Presi-
dent didn’t even care if an investiga-
tion was actually conducted, just that 
it was announced. Why? Because this 
was for his own personal and political 
benefit. 
The 
first 
article 
further 
charges that the President did so with 
corrupt motives and that his use of 
power for personal gain harmed the na-
tional security of the United States. 
As the second Article of Impeach-
ment charges, the President sought to 
conceal evidence of this conduct. He 
did so by ordering his entire adminis-
tration—every office, every agency, 
every official—to defy every subpoena 
served in the House impeachment in-
quiry. No President in history has ever 
done anything like this. Many Presi-
dents have expressly acknowledged 
that they couldn’t do anything like 
this. 
President Trump did not take these 
extreme steps to hide evidence of his 
innocence or to protect the institution 
of the Presidency. As a career law en-
forcement officer, I have never seen 
anyone take such extreme steps to hide 
evidence allegedly proving his inno-
cence, and I do not find that here 
today. The President is engaged in this 
coverup because he is guilty, and he 
knows it. And he knows that the evi-
dence he is concealing will only further 
demonstrate his culpability. 
Notwithstanding this effort to stone-
wall our inquiry, the House amassed 
powerful evidence of the President’s 
high crimes and misdemeanors—17 wit-
nesses, 130 hours of testimony, com-
bined with the President’s own admis-
sions on phone calls and in public com-
ments, confirmed and corroborated by 
hundreds of texts, emails, and docu-
ments. 
Much of that evidence came from pa-
triotic, nonpartisan, decorated officials 
in the State Department. They are 
brave men and women who honored 
their obligations under the law and 
gave testimony required by congres-
sional subpoena in the face of the 
President’s taunts and insults. These 
officials described the President’s cam-
paign to induce and pressure Ukraine 
to announce political investigations; 
his use of $391 million of vital military 
aid—taxpayer money appropriated on a 
bipartisan basis by Congress—as lever-
age to force Ukraine to comply; and his 
withholding of a meeting desperately 
sought by the newly-elected President 
of Ukraine. 
This 
testimony 
was 
particularly 
compelling because the State Depart-
ment is at the very center of President 
Trump’s wrongdoing. We heard first-
hand from diplomatic officials who saw 
up close and personal what was hap-
pening and who immediately—imme-
diately—sounded the alarms. 
Ambassador William Taylor, who re-
turned to Ukraine in June of last year 
as Acting Ambassador, texted other 
State Department officials: ‘‘I think 
it’s crazy to withhold security assist-
ance for help with a political cam-
paign.’’ 
Ambassador to the European Union 
Gordon Sondland, who was delegated 
authority over Ukraine matters by 
none other than President Trump, tes-
tified: ‘‘We knew these investigations 
were important to the President’’ and 
‘‘we followed the President’s orders.’’ 
David Holmes, a senior official at the 
U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, said: ‘‘[I]t was 
made clear that some action on a 
Burisma/Biden investigation was a pre-
condition for an Oval Office meeting.’’ 
During their testimony, many of 
these State Department officials de-
scribed specific documents—including 
text messages, emails, former diplo-
matic cables, and notes—that would 
corroborate their testimony and shed 
additional light on President Trump’s 
corrupt scheme. 
For instance, Ambassador Taylor, 
who raised concerns that military aid 
had been conditioned on the Presi-
dent’s demand for political investiga-
tions, described a ‘‘little notebook’’ in 
which he would ‘‘take notes on con-
versations’’ he had with key officials. 
Ambassador Sondland referred by 
date and recipient to emails regarding 
the President’s demand that Ukraine 
announce political investigations. As 
we will see, those emails were sent to 
some of President Trump’s top advis-
ers, including Acting White House 
Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Sec-
retary of State Michael Pompeo, and 
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
George Kent, who oversaw Ukraine pol-
icy matters in Washington for the 
State Department, wrote at least four 
memos to file to document concerning 
conduct he witnessed or heard. 
Ambassador Kurt Volker, the Special 
Representative for Ukraine Negotia-
tions, provided evidence that he and 
other 
American 
officials 
commu-
nicated with high-level Ukrainian offi-
cials—including 
President 
Zelensky 
himself—via 
text 
message 
and 
WhatsApp about the President’s im-
proper demands and how Ukrainian of-
ficials would respond to them. 
Based on the testimony we received 
and 
on 
evidence 
that 
has 
since 
emerged, all of these documents and 
others that we will describe bear di-
rectly on the allegations set forth in 
the first Article of Impeachment. They 
would help complete our understanding 
of how the President’s scheme unfolded 
in real time. They would support the 
conclusion that senior Ukrainian offi-
cials understood the corrupt nature of 
President 
Trump’s 
demand. 
They 
would further expose the extent to 
which Secretary Pompeo, Acting Chief 
of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and other sen-
ior 
Trump 
administration 
officials 
were aware of the President’s plot and 
helped carry it out. 
We are not talking about a burden-
some number of documents; we are 
talking about a specific, discrete set of 
materials held by the State Depart-
ment—documents the State Depart-
ment has already collected in response 
to our subpoena but has never pro-
duced. We know these materials exist, 
we know they are relevant, and we 
know the President is desperately try-
ing to conceal them. 
As I will describe, the Senate should 
subpoena 
the 
following: 
No. 
1, 
WhatsApp and other text message com-
munications; 2, emails; 3, diplomatic 
cables; and 4, notes. 
Given the significance and relevance 
of these documents, the House re-
quested that they be provided. When 
these requests were denied—when our 
requests were denied—the House issued 
subpoenas commanding that the docu-
ments be turned over, but at the Presi-
dent’s direction, the Department of 
State unlawfully defied that subpoena. 
As I stand here now, the State De-
partment has all these documents in 
its possession but refuses, based on the 
President’s order, to let them see the 
light of day. This is an affront to the 
House, which has full power to see 
these documents. It is an affront to the 
Senate, which has been denied a full 
record on which to judge the Presi-
dent’s guilt or innocence. It is an af-
front to the Constitution, which makes 
clear that nobody, not even the Presi-
dent, is above the law. It is an affront 
to the American people, who have a 
right to know what the President and 
his allies are hiding from them and 
why it is being hidden. 
In prior impeachment trials, this 
body has issued subpoenas requiring

the recipient to hand over relevant 
documents. It must do so again here, 
and it must do so now at the beginning 
of the trial, not the end. 
Of course the need for a Senate sub-
poena arises because, as I have noted, 
the President ordered the State De-
partment to defy a subpoena from the 
House. At this point, I would like to 
briefly describe our own efforts to get 
those materials. I will then address in 
a more detailed fashion exactly what 
documents the State Department has 
hidden from the American people and 
why the Senate should require it to 
turn them over. 
On September 9, exercising their arti-
cle I oversight authority, the House in-
vestigating committee sent a docu-
ment request to the State Department. 
The committee sought materials re-
lated to the President’s effort to pres-
sure Ukraine to announce investiga-
tions into his political rival, as well as 
his dangerous, unexplained withholding 
of millions of dollars in vital military 
aid. 
After the State Department failed to 
produce any documents, the House 
Committee on Foreign Affairs issued a 
subpoena to the State Department on 
September 27. 
In a letter on October 1, Secretary 
Pompeo acknowledged receipt of the 
subpoena. At that time, he stated that 
he would respond to the committee’s 
subpoena for documents by the return 
date, October 4, but his response never 
came. 
Instead, on October 8, President 
Trump’s lawyer—writing on the Presi-
dent’s behalf—issued a direction con-
firming that the administration would 
stonewall the impeachment inquiry. 
To date, the State Department has 
not produced a single document—not a 
single document—in response to the 
congressional subpoena, but witnesses 
who testified indicated that the State 
Department had gathered all of the 
records and was prepared to provide 
them before the White House directed 
it to defy the subpoena. 
Notwithstanding this unlawful ob-
struction, through the testimony of 
brave State Department employees, 
the House was able to identify, with re-
markable precision, several categories 
of documents relevant to the first Arti-
cle of Impeachment that are sitting 
right now—right now—the documents 
are sitting right now at the State De-
partment. 
I would like to walk you through 
four key categories of documents that 
should be subpoenaed and which illus-
trate the highly relevant documents 
the State Department could produce 
immediately to this trial. 
The 
first 
category 
consists 
of 
WhatsApp and other text messages 
from 
State 
Department 
officials 
caught up in these events, including 
Ambassadors Sondland and Taylor and 
also 
Deputy 
Assistant 
Secretary 
George Kent, all three of whom con-
firmed in their testimony that they 
regularly use WhatsApp to commu-
nicate with each other and foreign gov-
ernment officials. 
As Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent 
explained, WhatsApp is the dominant 
form of electronic communication in 
certain parts of the world. We know 
that the State Department possesses 
records of WhatsApp and text messages 
from critical eyewitnesses to these pro-
ceedings, including from Ambassadors 
Sondland and Taylor and Deputy As-
sistant Secretary Kent. 
We know that the Department is de-
liberately concealing these records at 
the direction of the President, and we 
know that they could contain highly 
relevant testimony about the Presi-
dent’s plan to condition official Presi-
dential acts on the announcement of 
investigations for his own personal and 
political gain. 
We know this not only from testi-
mony but also because Ambassador 
Volker was able to provide us with a 
small but telling selection of his 
WhatsApp 
messages. 
Those 
records 
confirm that a full review of these 
texts and WhatsApp messages from rel-
evant officials would help to paint a 
vivid, firsthand picture of statements, 
decisions, concerns, and beliefs held by 
important players unfolding in real 
time. 
For example, thanks to Ambassador 
Volker’s messages, we know that Am-
bassador Sondland—a key player in the 
President’s pressure campaign who tes-
tified in the House about a quid pro 
quo arrangement—texted directly with 
the Ukrainian President, President 
Volodymyr Zelensky. This image pro-
duced by Ambassador Volker appears 
to be a screenshot of a text message 
that Ambassador Sondland exchanged 
with President Zelensky about plans 
for a White House visit—the very same 
visit that President Zelensky badly 
needed and that President Trump later 
withheld as part of the quid pro quo de-
scribed by Ambassador Sondland in his 
testimony. 
This body and the American people 
have a right to know what else Ambas-
sador Sondland and President Zelensky 
said in this and other relevant ex-
changes about the White House meet-
ing or about the military aid and the 
President’s demands, but we don’t 
know exactly what was conveyed and 
when. We don’t know it because Presi-
dent Trump directed the State Depart-
ment to conceal these vital records. 
These are records that the State De-
partment would have otherwise turned 
over if not for the President’s direction 
and desire to cover up his wrongdoing. 
To get a sense of why texts and 
WhatsApp messages are so vital, just 
consider yet another piece of evidence 
we have gleaned from Ambassador 
Volker’s partial production. 
On July 10, after the White House 
meetings 
at 
which 
Ambassador 
Sondland pressured Ukrainian officials 
to announce investigations of Presi-
dent Trump’s political opponents, a 
Ukraine official texted Ambassador 
Volker: ‘‘I feel that the key for many 
things is Rudi and I ready to talk with 
him at any time.’’ 
This is evidence that, immediately 
following Ambassador Sondland’s ulti-
matum, Ukrainian officials recognized 
that they needed to appease Rudy 
Giuliani by carrying out the investiga-
tions. Of course, Mr. Giuliani had pub-
licly confirmed that he was not en-
gaged in ‘‘foreign policy’’ but was in-
stead advancing his client’s—the Presi-
dent’s—own personal interests. 
Further, in another text message ex-
change 
provided 
by 
Ambassador 
Volker, we see evidence that Ukraine 
understood President Trump’s demands 
loud and clear. 
On the morning of July 25, half an 
hour before the infamous call between 
President 
Trump 
and 
President 
Zelensky, Ambassador Volker wrote to 
a senior Ukrainian official: 
Heard from White House—assuming Presi-
dent Z convinces trump he will investigate/ 
‘‘get to the bottom of what happened’’ in 
2016, we will nail down date for visit to 
Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow— 
Kurt. 
Ambassador Sondland confirmed that 
this text accurately summarized the 
President’s directive to him earlier 
that morning. 
After the phone call between Presi-
dent Trump and President Zelensky, 
the 
Ukrainian 
official 
responded, 
pointedly: ‘‘Phone call went well.’’ He 
then discussed potential dates for a 
White House meeting. 
Then, the very next day, Ambassador 
Volker wrote to Rudy Giuliani: ‘‘Ex-
actly the right messages as we dis-
cussed.’’ 
These 
messages 
confirm 
Mr. 
Giuliani’s central role, the premedi-
tated nature of President Trump’s so-
licitation of political investigations, 
and the pressure campaign on Ukraine 
waged by Mr. Giuliani and senior offi-
cials at President Trump’s direction. 
Again, this is just some of what we 
learned 
from 
Ambassador 
Volker’s 
records. As you will see during this 
trial presentation, there were numer-
ous WhatsApp messages in August 
while 
Ambassadors 
Volker 
and 
Sondland and Mr. Giuliani were pres-
suring President Zelensky’s top aide to 
issue a statement announcing the in-
vestigation 
that 
President 
Trump 
wanted. Ambassador Taylor’s text that 
you saw earlier about withholding the 
aid further reveals how much more ma-
terial there likely is that relates to the 
Articles of Impeachment. 
There can be no doubt that a full pro-
duction 
of 
relevant 
texts 
and 
WhatsApp messages from other offi-
cials involved in Ukraine and in touch 
with 
Ukrainian 
officials—including 
Ambassador 
Sondland, 
Ambassador 
Taylor, and Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary Kent—would further illuminate 
the malfeasance addressed in our first 
article. 
This leads to the second category of 
documents that the State Department 
is unlawfully withholding—emails in-
volving key State Department officials

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S397 
January 21, 2020 
concerning interactions with senior 
Ukrainian officials and relating to 
military aid, a White House meeting, 
and the President’s demand for an in-
vestigation into his rivals. 
For example, on July 19, Ambassador 
Gordon Sondland spoke directly with 
President Zelensky about the upcom-
ing July 25 call between President 
Trump and President Zelensky. 
Ambassador Sondland sent an email 
updating key officials, including Sec-
retary Pompeo, Acting White House 
Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and his senior 
adviser, Robert Blair. In this email, he 
noted that he ‘‘prepared’’ President 
Zelensky, who was willing to make the 
announcements of political investiga-
tions that President Trump desired. 
Secretary Perry and Mick Mulvaney 
then responded to Sondland, acknowl-
edging they received the email and rec-
ommending to move forward with the 
phone call that became the July 25 call 
between the Presidents of the United 
States and Ukraine. 
We know all of this not because the 
State Department provided us with 
critical documents but, instead, be-
cause Ambassador Sondland provided 
us a reproduction of the email. 
In his further testimony, Ambassador 
Sondland 
quite 
correctly 
explained 
that this email demonstrated ‘‘every-
one was in the loop.’’ 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. 
Everyone was informed via email on July 
19th, days before the Presidential call. As I 
communicated to the team, I told President 
Zelensky in advance that assurances to run 
a fully transparent investigation and turn 
over every stone were necessary in his call 
with President Trump. 
Mrs. 
Manager 
DEMINGS. 
Even 
viewed alone, this reproduced email is 
damning. It was sent shortly after Am-
bassador Sondland personally conveyed 
the President’s demand for investiga-
tions to Ukrainians at the White 
House, leading several officials to 
sound alarms. It was said just a few 
days before the July 25 call, where 
President Trump asked for a ‘‘favor,’’ 
and, by itself, this email shows who 
was involved in President Trump’s plan 
to pressure the Ukrainian President for 
his own political gain. 
But it is obvious that the full email 
chain and other related emails to this 
key time period would also be highly 
relevant. We don’t have those emails 
because the State Department is hiding 
them, at the direction of the President. 
The Senate should issue the proposed 
subpoena to ensure a complete record 
of these and other relevant emails. 
Any doubt that the State Depart-
ment is concealing critical evidence 
from this body was resolved when the 
State Department was recently ordered 
to release documents, including emails, 
pursuant to a lawsuit under the Free-
dom of Information Act. These docu-
ments are heavily redacted and are 
limited to a very narrow time period, 
but, nevertheless, despite the heavy 
redactions, this highly limited glimpse 
into the State Department’s secret 
records 
demonstrates 
that 
those 
records are full of information relevant 
to this trial. 
For example, several of these newly 
released emails show multiple contacts 
between the State Department, includ-
ing 
Secretary 
Pompeo, 
and 
Mr. 
Giuliani throughout 2019. This is an 
important fact. 
Mr. Giuliani served as the President’s 
point person and executed his corrupt 
scheme. Mr. Giuliani repeatedly em-
phasized that his role was to advance 
the President’s personal agenda—the 
President’s political interests, not to 
promote the national security interests 
of the United States. The fact that the 
President’s private attorney was in 
contact at key junctures with the Sec-
retary of State, whose senior officials 
were directed by the President to sup-
port Mr. Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine, 
is relevant, disturbing, and telling. 
For example, we know that on March 
26, as Mr. Giuliani was pursuing the 
President’s private agenda in Ukraine, 
and just 1 week after The Hill pub-
lished 
an 
article 
featuring 
Mr. 
Giuliani’s Ukraine conspiracy theories, 
Secretary Pompeo and Mr. Giuliani 
spoke directly on the phone. 
That same week, President Trump’s 
former personal secretary was asked by 
Mr. Giuliani’s assistant for a direct 
connection to Secretary Pompeo. 
Based on these records, it is also 
clear that Secretary Pompeo was al-
ready 
actively 
engaged 
with 
Mr. 
Giuliani in early spring of 2019. It also 
appears that these efforts were backed 
by the White House, given the involve-
ment of President Trump’s personal 
secretary. 
This body and the American people 
need to see these emails and other files 
at the State Department, flushing out 
these exchanges and the details sur-
rounding Mr. Giuliani’s communica-
tions with Secretary Pompeo. More-
over, based on call records lawfully ob-
tained by the House from this period, 
we know that from March 24 to March 
30, Mr. Giuliani called the White House 
several times and also connected with 
an 
unidentified 
number 
numerous 
times. 
These records show that on March 27, 
Mr. Giuliani placed a series of calls— 
series of calls—to the State Depart-
ment switchboard, Secretary Pompeo’s 
assistant, and the White House switch-
board in quick succession, all within 
less than 30 minutes. 
Obtaining emails and other docu-
ments regarding the State Department 
leadership’s interaction with President 
Trump’s private lawyer in this period, 
when Mr. Giuliani was actively orches-
trating 
the 
pressure 
campaign 
in 
Ukraine related to the sham investiga-
tion into Vice President Biden and the 
2016 election, would further clarify the 
President’s involvement and direction 
at this key juncture in the formation 
of a plot to solicit foreign interference 
in our election. 
We also know, based on recently ob-
tained documents from Lev Parnas, an 
associate of Rudy Giuliani who assisted 
him in his representation of President 
Trump, that Giuliani likely spoke with 
Secretary Pompeo about Ukraine mat-
ters even earlier than previously un-
derstood. 
According to documents obtained 
from Mr. Parnas, Mr. Giuliani wrote in 
early February of 2019 that he appar-
ently spoke with Secretary Pompeo 
about the removal of the U.S. Ambas-
sador in Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. 
Mr. Giuliani viewed her as an impedi-
ment to implementing the President’s 
corrupt scheme and orchestrated a 
long-running smear campaign against 
her. Here is what Mr. Parnas said about 
this just last week. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. MADDOW. Do you believe that part of 
the motivation to get rid of Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, to get her out of post, was she 
was in the way of this effort to get the gov-
ernment of Ukraine to announce investiga-
tions of Joe Biden? 
Mr. PARNAS. That was the only motiva-
tion. 
Ms. MADDOW. That was the only motiva-
tion? 
Mr. PARNAS. There was no other motiva-
tion. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. These are 
just some of the email communications 
that we know to exist, but there are 
undoubtedly more, including, for exam-
ple, Ambassador Yovanovitch’s request 
for the State Department to issue a 
statement of support of her around the 
time that Mr. Giuliani was speaking di-
rectly with Secretary Pompeo, but 
that statement never came. 
The State Department has gathered 
these records, and they are ready to be 
turned over pursuant to a subpoena 
from the Senate. It would not be a 
time-consuming or lengthy process to 
obtain them, and there are clearly— 
clearly—important and relevant docu-
ments to the President’s scheme. If we 
want the full and complete truth, then 
we need to see those emails. 
The Senate should also seek a third 
item that the State Department has re-
fused to provide, and that is Ambas-
sador Taylor’s extraordinary first-per-
son diplomatic cable to Secretary 
Pompeo, dated August 29 and sent at 
the recommendation of the National 
Security Advisor, John Bolton, in 
which Ambassador Taylor strenuously 
objected to the withholding of military 
aid from Ukraine, as Ambassador Tay-
lor recounted in his deposition. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Near the end of Am-
bassador Bolton’s visit, I asked to meet him 
privately, during which I expressed to him 
my serious concern about the withholding of 
military assistance to Ukraine while the 
Ukrainians were defending their country 
from Russian aggression. Ambassador Bolton 
recommended that I send a first-person cable 
to Secretary Pompeo directly relaying my 
concerns. 
I wrote and transmitted such a cable on 
August 29th, describing the folly I saw in 
withholding military aid to Ukraine at a 
time when hostilities were still active in the 
east and when Russia was watching closely 
to gauge the level of American support for

the Ukrainian Government. The Russians, as 
I said at my deposition, would love to see the 
humiliation of President Zelensky at the 
hands of the Americans. I told the Secretary 
that I could not and would not defend such a 
policy. 
Although I received no specific response, I 
heard that soon thereafter the Secretary car-
ried the cable with him to a meeting at the 
White House focused on security assistance 
for Ukraine. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. While we 
know from Ambassador Taylor and 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent that 
the cable was received, we do not know 
whether or how the State Department 
responded, nor do we know if the State 
Department possesses any other inter-
nal records relating to this cable. 
This cable is vital for three reasons. 
First, it demonstrates the harm that 
President Trump did to our national 
security when he used foreign policy as 
an instrument of his own personal, po-
litical gain. Second, on the same day 
the 
cable 
was 
sent, 
President 
Zelensky’s senior aide told Ambassador 
Taylor that he was ‘‘very concerned’’ 
about the hold on military assistance. 
He added that the Ukrainians were 
‘‘just desperate’’ for it to be released. 
In other words, President Trump’s ef-
fort to use military aid to apply addi-
tional pressure on Ukraine was work-
ing. 
Finally, based on reporting by the 
New York Times, we now know that 
within days of Ambassador Taylor 
sending this cable, President Trump 
discussed Ukrainian security assist-
ance with Secretary Pompeo, Defense 
Secretary Esper, and National Security 
Advisor Bolton. The investigation un-
covered 
testimony 
that 
Secretary 
Pompeo brought Ambassador Taylor’s 
cable to the White House; perhaps it 
was during this meeting. There, per-
haps prodded by Ambassador Taylor’s 
cable, all three of them pleaded—plead-
ed—with the President to resume the 
crucial military aid. Yet the President 
refused. 
This body has a right to see Ambas-
sador Taylor’s cable, as well as the 
other State Department records ad-
dressing the official response to it. Al-
though it may have been classified at 
the time, the State Department could 
no longer claim that the topic of secu-
rity assistance remains classified today 
in light of the President’s decision to 
declassify his two telephone calls with 
President Zelensky and Mr. Mulvaney’s 
public statements about security as-
sistance. 
The fourth category of documents 
that the Senate should subpoena are 
contemporaneous, 
first-person 
ac-
counts from State Department officials 
who were caught up in President 
Trump’s corrupt scheme. These docu-
ments, which were described in detail 
by Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent, 
Ambassador Taylor, and political offi-
cer David Holmes, would help complete 
the record and clarify how the Presi-
dent’s scheme unfolded in realtime and 
how the Ukrainians reacted. 
Mr. Kent wrote notes or memos to 
file at least four times, according to 
his 
testimony. 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
took extensive notes of nearly every 
conversation he had—some in a little 
notebook. David Holmes, the Embassy 
official in Ukraine, was a consistent 
notetaker of important meetings with 
Ukrainian officials. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you take notes of this 
conversation on September 1st with Ambas-
sador Sondland? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. I did. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And did you take notes re-
lated to most of the conversations, if not all 
of them, that you recited in your opening 
statement? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. All of them, Mr. 
Goldman. 
. . . 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And you are aware, I pre-
sume, that the State Department has not 
provided those notes to the committee. Is 
that right? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. I am aware. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. So we don’t have the ben-
efit of reviewing them to ask you these ques-
tions. 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Correct. I under-
stand that they may be coming, sooner or 
later. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Well, we would welcome 
that. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. The State 
Department 
never 
produced 
those 
notes. 
As another example, Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary Kent testified about a 
key document that he drafted on Au-
gust 16, describing his concerns that 
the Trump administration was at-
tempting to pressure Ukraine into 
opening politically motivated inves-
tigations. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
[Ms. SPEIER.] I’d like to start with 
you, Mr. Kent. In your testimony, you 
said that you had—‘‘In mid-August, it 
became clear to me that Giuliani’s ef-
forts to gin up politically motivated 
investigations were now infecting U.S. 
engagement with Ukraine, leveraging 
President Zelensky’s desire for a White 
House meeting.’’ Mr. Kent, did you ac-
tually write a memo documenting your 
concerns that there was an effort under 
way to pressure Ukraine to open an in-
vestigation 
to 
benefit 
President 
Trump? 
Mr. KENT. Yes, ma’am. I wrote a memo to 
the file on August 16th. 
Ms. SPEIER. But we don’t have access to 
that memo, do we? 
Mr. KENT. I submitted it to the State De-
partment, subject to the September 27th sub-
poena. 
Ms. SPEIER. And we have not received one 
piece of paper from the State Department 
relative to this investigation. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Deputy As-
sistant Secretary Kent also memorial-
ized a September 15 conversation in 
which Ambassador Taylor described a 
Ukrainian official accusing America of 
hypocrisy 
for 
advising 
President 
Zelensky against investigating a prior 
Ukrainian president. Mr. Kent de-
scribed that conversation during his 
testimony. He said: 
But the more awkward part of the con-
versation came after Special Representative 
Volker made the point that the Ukrainians, 
who had opened their authorities under 
Zelensky, 
had 
opened 
investigations 
of 
former President Poroshenko. He didn’t 
think that was appropriate. 
And then Andriy Yermak said: What? You 
mean the type of investigations you’re push-
ing for us to do on Biden and Clinton? 
The conversation makes clear the 
Ukrainian officials understood the cor-
rupt nature of President Trump’s re-
quest and therefore doubted American 
credibility on anti-corruption meas-
ures. 
Records of these conversations—and 
other notes and memorandum by sen-
ior American officials in Ukraine— 
would flesh out and help complete the 
record for the first Article of Impeach-
ment. They would tell the whole truth 
to the American people and to this 
body. You should require the State De-
partment to provide them. 
To summarize, the Senate should 
issue the subpoena proposed and the 
amendment requiring the State De-
partment to turn over relevant text 
messages 
and 
WhatsApp 
messages, 
emails, diplomatic cables, and notes. 
These documents bear directly on the 
trial of this body—the trial that this 
body is required by the Constitution to 
hold. They are immediately relevant to 
the first Article of Impeachment. Their 
existence has been attested to by cred-
ible witnesses in the House, and the 
only reason we don’t already have 
them is that the President has ordered 
his 
administration, 
including 
Sec-
retary Pompeo, to hide them. 
The President’s lawyers may suggest 
that the House should have sought 
these materials in court or awaited fur-
ther lawsuits under the Freedom of In-
formation Act, a.k.a. FOIA lawsuits. 
Any such suggestion is meritless. 
To start, the Constitution has never 
been understood to require such law-
suits, which has never occurred—never 
occurred—in any previous impeach-
ment. 
Moreover, the President has repeat-
edly and strenuously argued that the 
House is not even allowed to file a suit 
to enforce its subpoenas. 
In the Freedom of Information Act 
cases, the administration has only 
grudgingly and slowly produced an ex-
tremely small set of materials but has 
insisted on applying heavy and dubious 
redactions. 
FOIA lawsuits filed by third parties 
cannot serve as a credible alternative 
to congressional oversight. In fact, it is 
still alarming that the administration 
has produced more documents pursuant 
to Freedom of Information Act law-
suits by private citizens and entities 
than congressional subpoenas. 
Finally, as we all know, litigation 
would take an extremely long time— 
likely years, not weeks or months— 
while the misconduct of this President 
requires immediate attention. The mis-
conduct of this President requires im-
mediate attention. 
If this body is truly committed to a 
fair trial, it cannot let the President 
play a game of ‘‘keep away’’ and dic-
tate what evidence the Senators can

and cannot see bearing on his guilt or 
innocence. This body cannot permit 
him to hide all the evidence while dis-
ingenuously insisting on lawsuits that 
he doesn’t actually think we can file— 
ones that he knows will not be resolved 
until after the election he is trying to 
cheat to win. Instead, to honor your 
oaths to do impartial justice, we urge 
each Senator to support a subpoena to 
the State Department. And that sub-
poena should be issued now, at the be-
ginning of the trial, rather than at the 
end so these documents can be re-
viewed and their importance weighed 
by the parties, by the Senate, and by 
the American people. That is how 
things work in every courtroom in the 
Nation, and it is how they should work 
here, especially because the stakes, as 
you all know, are so high. 
The truth is there. Facts are stub-
born things. The President is trying to 
hide it. This body should not surrender 
to his obstruction by refusing to de-
mand a full record. That is why the 
House managers support this amend-
ment. 
Mr. Chief Justice, the House man-
agers reserve the balance of our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
In the interest of time, I will not re-
peat all of the arguments we have 
made already with respect to these mo-
tions. I would say one thing before I 
turn it over to my cocounsel. Mr. 
SCHIFF came here and said he is not 
asking 
you 
to 
do 
something 
he 
wouldn’t do for himself, and the House 
manager said: We were not asking you 
to do our jobs for us. 
Mr. SCHIFF came up here and said: ‘‘I 
call Ambassador Bolton.’’ Remember 
Paul Harvey? It is time for the rest of 
the story. He didn’t call him in the 
House. He didn’t subpoena Ambassador 
Bolton in the House. 
I have a letter here from Ambassador 
Bolton’s lawyer. He is the same lawyer 
that Charlie Kupperman hired. It is 
dated November 8. He said: I write as 
counsel to Dr. Charles Kupperman and 
to Ambassador John Bolton in response 
to, one, the letter of November 5 from 
Chairman SCHIFF, Chairman ENGEL, 
and Acting Chair MALONEY, the House 
chairs, withdrawing the subpoena to 
Dr. Kupperman—I mentioned that ear-
lier—and to recent published reports 
announcing that the House chairs do 
not intend to issue subpoenas to Am-
bassador Bolton. 
He goes on to say: ‘‘We are dismayed 
that committees have chosen not to 
join in seeking resolution from the Ju-
dicial Branch of this momentous Con-
stitutional question.’’ He ends the let-
ter by saying: ‘‘If the House chooses 
not to pursue through subpoena the 
testimony of Dr. Kupperman and Am-
bassador Bolton, let the record be 
clear: that is the House’s decision.’’ 
They made that decision. They never 
subpoenaed Ambassador Bolton. They 
didn’t try to call him in the House. 
They 
withdrew 
the 
subpoena 
for 
Charles Kupperman before the judge 
could rule, and they asked that the 
case be mooted. Now they come here, 
and they ask you to issue a subpoena 
for John Bolton. It is not right. 
I yield the remainder of my time to 
Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, the 
managers said facts are a stubborn 
thing. Let me give you some facts. It is 
from the transcripts. 
Ambassador Sondland actually testi-
fied unequivocally that the President 
did not tie aid to investigations. In-
stead, he acknowledged that any leak 
he had suggested was based entirely on 
his own speculation, unconnected to 
any conversation with the President. 
Here is the question: 
What about the aid? Ambassador Volker 
says that the aid was not tied. 
Answer. I didn’t say that they were conclu-
sively tied either. I said I was presuming it. 
Question. OK. And so the President never 
told you they were tied? 
Answer. That is correct. 
Question. So your testimony and Ambas-
sador Volker’s testimony is consistent, and 
the President did not tie investigations, aid 
to investigations? 
Answer. That is correct. 
Ambassador Sondland also testified 
that he asked President Trump di-
rectly about these issues, and the 
President explicitly told him that he 
did not want anything from Ukraine. 
He said: 
I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no 
quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right 
thing. 
Similar comments were made to Sen-
ator JOHNSON. 
Those are the facts—stubborn, but 
those are the facts. 
No one is above the law. Here is the 
law. As every Member of Congress 
knows and is undoubtedly aware, sepa-
rate from even state sacred privileges 
is the Presidential communication ex-
ecutive privilege to communications in 
performance of a President’s respon-
sibilities. The Presidential communica-
tion privilege has constitutional ori-
gins. Courts have recognized a great 
public interest in preserving the con-
fidentiality of conversations that take 
place in the President’s performance of 
his official duties because such con-
fidentiality is needed to protect the ef-
fectiveness of the Executive decision-
making process. That is In re Sealed 
Case, which was decided in the District 
of Columbia Court of Appeals. 
The Supreme Court found such a 
privilege necessary to guarantee the 
candor of Presidential advisers and to 
provide a President and those who as-
sist him with freedom to explore alter-
natives in the process of ultimately 
shaping policies and making decisions 
and to do so in a way many would be 
unwilling to express except in private. 
For these reasons, Presidential con-
versations are presumptively privi-
leged. 
There is something else about this 
privilege. Communications made by 
Presidential advisers—again quoting 
courts—and by the way, lawyer law-
suits? Lawyer lawsuits? We are talking 
about the impeachment of a President 
of the United States, duly elected, and 
the Members and the managers are 
complaining about lawyer lawsuits? 
The Constitution allows lawyer law-
suits. It is disrespecting the Constitu-
tion of the United States to even say 
that in this Chamber, ‘‘lawyer law-
suits.’’ 
Here is the law. Communications 
made by Presidential advisers in the 
course of preparing advice for the 
President come under the Presidential 
communications privilege even when 
these communications are not made di-
rectly to the President—even when 
they are not made directly to the 
President—adviser to adviser. Given 
the need to provide sufficient elbow 
room for advisers to obtain informa-
tion from all knowledgeable sources, 
the privilege must apply both to com-
munications which these advisers solic-
ited and received from others, as well 
as those they authorized themselves. 
The privilege must also extend to 
communications authored or received 
in response to solicitation by members 
of a Presidential adviser’s staff since in 
many instances advisers must rely on 
their staffs to investigate an issue and 
formulate advice given to the Presi-
dent. 
Lawsuits, the Constitution—it is a 
dangerous moment for America when 
an impeachment of a President of the 
United States is being rushed through 
because of lawyer lawsuits. The Con-
stitution allows it, if necessary. The 
Constitution demands it, if necessary. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mrs. DEMINGS, 
you have 13 minutes for rebuttal, or 
Mr. SCHIFF. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
Let me respond to some of my col-
league’s points, if I can. 
First, counsel said: Well, the House 
would like to call John Bolton, but the 
House did not seek his testimony dur-
ing its investigation. 
Well, first of all, we did. We invited 
John Bolton to testify. Do you know 
what he told us? He said: 
I am not coming. And if you subpoena me, 
I will sue you. 
That was his answer: ‘‘I will sue 
you.’’ 
Mr. Bolton is represented by the 
same 
lawyer 
who 
represents 
Dr. 
Kupperman, who actually did sue us 
when he was subpoenaed. So we knew 
that John Bolton would make good on 
that threat. 
Mr. Sekulow said something about 
lawyer lawsuits. I have to confess, I 
wasn’t completely following the argu-
ment, but he said something about law-
yer lawsuits and that we are against 
lawyer lawsuits. I don’t know what 
that means, but I can tell you this: The 
Trump Justice Department is in court 
in that case and in other cases arguing 
that Congress cannot go to court to en-
force its subpoenas. So when they say

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

January 21, 2020 
something about lawyer lawsuits and 
they say there is nothing wrong with 
the House suing to get these witnesses 
to show up and they should have sued 
to get them to show up, their own law-
yers are in court saying that the House 
has no such right. They are in court 
saying that you can’t have lawyer law-
suits. That argument cannot be made 
in both directions. 
What is more, in the McGhan issue, 
which tested this same bogus theory of 
absolute immunity—once again, that 
lawsuit involving the President’s law-
yer, Don McGahn, the one who was told 
to fire the special counsel and then to 
lie about it, that lawsuit to get his tes-
timony—Judge Jackson ruled on that 
very recently when they made the 
same bogus claim, saying that he is ab-
solutely immune from showing up. 
The judge said: 
That is nonsense. There is no support for 
that—not in the Constitution, not in the 
case. That is made out of whole cloth. 
But the judge said something more 
that was very interesting. What we 
urged John Bolton’s lawyer was, you 
don’t need to file a lawsuit. Dr. 
Kupperman, you don’t need to file a 
lawsuit. There is one already filed in-
volving Don McGahn that is about to 
be decided. So unless your real purpose 
here is delay, unless your real purpose 
here is to avoid testimony and you just 
wish to give the impression of a will-
ingness to come forward, you just want 
to have the court’s blessing—if that is 
really true, agree to be bound by the 
McGahn decision. 
Well, of course, they were not willing 
because they didn’t want to testify. 
Now, for whatever reason, John Bolton 
is now willing to testify. I don’t know 
why that is. Maybe it is because he has 
a book coming out. Maybe it is because 
it would be very hard to explain why he 
was unwilling to share important infor-
mation with the Senate; that he 
couldn’t show up for a House deposi-
tion or interview because he would 
need court permission to do it, but he 
could put it in the book. I don’t know. 
I can’t speak to his motivation. I can 
tell you he is willing to come now, if 
you are willing to hear him. 
Of course, they weren’t willing to be 
bound 
by 
that 
court 
decision 
in 
McGahn, but the court said something 
very interesting, because one of the ar-
guments they happened to make—one 
of the arguments that John Bolton’s 
lawyer had been making as to why 
they needed their own separate litiga-
tion was, well, John Bolton and Dr. 
Kupperman, they are national security 
people, and Don McGahn is just a 
White House Counsel. No offense to the 
White House Counsel, but apparently it 
had nothing to do with the national se-
curity so they couldn’t be bound by 
what the court in the McGahn case 
said. Well, the judge in the McGahn 
case said this applies to national secu-
rity stuff too. 
So we do have the court decision. 
What is more, we have the court deci-
sion in the Harriet Miers case, in the 
George W. Bush administration, where, 
likewise, the court made short shrift of 
this claim of absolute, complete, and 
total immunity. 
Now, there were also comments made 
about Ambassador Volker’s testimony 
by Mr. Cipollone, and they were along 
these lines: Ambassador Volker said 
the President never told him that the 
aid was being conditioned or that the 
meeting was being conditioned on 
Ukraine doing the sham investigation. 
So I guess that is case closed—unless 
the President told everyone, called 
them into the office and said: Hey, I 
am going to tell you now; and then: I 
am going to tell you now. If he didn’t 
tell everyone, I guess it is case closed. 
Well, you know who the President 
did tell, among others? He told Mick 
Mulvaney. Mick Mulvaney went out on 
national television and said, yes, they 
discussed it, this investigation, this 
Russian 
narrative 
that 
it 
wasn’t 
Ukraine that intervened in 2016; it was 
Russia. I am sorry. It wasn’t Russia; it 
was Ukraine. Yes, that bogus 2016 the-
ory; yes, they discussed it; yes, it was 
part of the reason why they withheld 
the money. 
When a reporter said: Well, you are 
kind of describing a quid pro quo, his 
answer was: Yes, get used to it—or get 
over it. We do it all the time. 
Now, they haven’t said they want to 
hear from Mick Mulvaney. I wonder 
why. The President did talk to Mick 
Mulvaney about it. Wouldn’t you like 
to hear what Mick Mulvaney has to 
say? If you really want to get to the 
bottom of this, if they are really chal-
lenging the fact that the President 
conditioned $400 million in military aid 
to an ally at war, if Mick Mulvaney has 
already said publicly that he talked to 
the President about it, and this is part 
of the reason why, don’t you think we 
should hear from him? Wouldn’t you 
think impartial justice requires you to 
hear from him? 
Now, counsel also referred to Ambas-
sador Sondland and Sondland saying: 
Well, the President told me there was 
no quid pro quo. Now, of course, at the 
time the President said to Sondland no 
quid pro quo, he became aware of the 
whistleblower complaint, presumably 
by Mr. Cipollone. So the President 
knew that this was going to come to 
light. On the advice, apparently, of Mr. 
Cipollone, or maybe others, the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence, for the 
first time in history, withheld a whis-
tleblower complaint from Congress, its 
intended recipient. Nonetheless, the 
White House was aware of that com-
plaint. We launched our own investiga-
tions. 
Yes, they got caught. In the midst of 
being caught, what does he say? It is 
called a false exculpatory. For those 
people at home, that is a fancy word of 
saying it is a false, phony alibi. No 
quid pro quo. He wasn’t even asked the 
question was there a quid pro quo. He 
just blurted it out. That is the defense? 
The President denies it? What is more 
interesting, he didn’t tell you about 
the other half of that conversation 
where the President says no quid pro 
quo. He says: No quid pro quo, but 
Zelensky needs to go to the mike, and 
he should want to do it, which is the 
equivalent of saying no quid pro quo, 
except the quid pro quo, and here is 
what it is. The quid pro quo is he needs 
to go to the mike, and he should want 
to do it. That is their alibi? 
They didn’t also mention, of course— 
and you will hear about this during the 
trial, if we have a real trial. Ambas-
sador Sondland also said: We are often 
asked was there a quid pro quo, and the 
answer is, yes, there was a quid pro 
quo. There was an absolute quid pro 
quo. 
What is more, when it came to the 
military aid, it was as simple as two 
plus two. Well, I will tell you some-
thing. We are not the only people who 
can add up two plus two. There are mil-
lions of people watching this who can 
add up two plus two also. When the 
President tells his Chief of Staff: We 
are holding up the aid because of this, 
as the Chief of Staff admitted; when 
the President gives no plausible or 
other explanation for holding up aid 
that you all and we all supported and 
voted on in a very bipartisan way, has 
no explanation for it; when in that call 
he never brings up corruption except 
the corruption he wants to bring about, 
it doesn’t take a genius, it doesn’t take 
Albert Einstein to add up two plus two. 
It equals four. In this case, it equals 
guilt. 
Now, you are going to have 16 hours 
to ask questions. You are going to have 
16 hours. That is a long time to ask 
questions. Wouldn’t you like to be able 
to ask about the documents in that 16 
hours? Would you like to be able to 
say: Counsel for the President, what 
did Mick Mulvaney mean when he 
emailed so-and-so and said such and 
such? What is your explanation for 
that because that seems to be pretty 
damning evidence of exactly what the 
House is saying. What is your expla-
nation of that? Mr. Sekulow, what is 
your explanation? 
Wouldn’t you like to be able to ask 
about the documents or ask the House: 
Mr. SCHIFF, what about this text mes-
sage? Doesn’t that suggest such—what 
the President is arguing? Wouldn’t you 
like to be able to ask me that question, 
or one of my colleagues? I think you 
would. I think you should. 
But the backward way this resolu-
tion is drafted, you get 16 hours to ask 
questions about documents you have 
never seen. You know what is more? If 
you do decide at that point, after the 
trial is essentially over, that you do 
want to see the documents after all and 
the documents are produced, you don’t 
get another 16 hours. You don’t get 16 
minutes. You don’t get 16 seconds to 
ask about those documents. Does that 
make any sense to you? Does that 
make any sense at all? 
I will tell you something I would like 
to know that may be in the documents. 
You probably heard before about the

three amigos. My colleague has men-
tioned two of the three amigos: Amigo 
Volker and Amigo Sondland. These are 
two of the three people whom the 
President put in charge of Ukraine pol-
icy. The third amigo is Secretary Rick 
Perry, former Secretary of Energy. We 
know from Amigo Sondland’s testi-
mony that he was certainly in the loop, 
knew exactly all about this scheme, 
and 
we 
knew 
from 
Ambassador 
Volker’s testimony and his text mes-
sages and his WhatsApps that that 
amigo was in the loop. 
What 
about 
the 
third 
amigo? 
Wouldn’t you like to know if the third 
amigo was in the loop? Now, as my col-
leagues will explain when we get to the 
Department of Energy records, well, 
surprisingly, we didn’t get those either. 
Any communication between the De-
partment of Energy and the Depart-
ment of State is covered by this 
amendment. Wouldn’t you like to 
know? Don’t you think the American 
people have a right to know what the 
third amigo knew about this scheme? I 
would like to know. I think you should 
be able to ask questions about it in 
your 16 hours. 
At the end of the day, I guess I will 
finish with something Mr. Sekulow 
said. He said this was a dangerous mo-
ment because we are trying to rush 
through this somehow. It is a dan-
gerous moment, but we are not trying 
to rush through this trial. We are actu-
ally trying to have a real trial here. It 
is the President who is trying to rush 
through this. 
I have to tell you that whatever you 
decide here—maybe this is a waste of 
breath and maybe it is already decided, 
but whatever you decide here—I don’t 
know who the next President is going 
to be; maybe it will be someone in this 
Chamber, but I guarantee you this: 
Whoever that next President is, wheth-
er they did something right or they did 
something wrong, there is going to 
come a time where you, in this body, 
are going to subpoena that President 
and that administration. You are going 
to want to get to the bottom of serious 
allegations. Are you prepared to say 
that that President can simply say: I 
am going to fight all the subpoenas. 
Are you prepared to say and accept 
that President saying: I have absolute 
immunity. You want me to come tes-
tify? Senator, do you want me to come 
testify? No, no. I have absolute immu-
nity. You can subpoena me all you 
like. I will see you in court. And when 
you get to court, I am going to tell 
you, you can’t see me in court. 
Are you prepared for that? That is 
what the future looks like. Don’t think 
this is the last President, if you allow 
this to happen, who is going to allow 
this to take place. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I yield back.

The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
PROGRAM 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
first a scheduling note: As the parties 
are ready to debate this amendment, I 
suggest we go ahead, get through the 
debate, and vote before we take a 30- 
minute recess for dinner. 
I remind everyone that I will be mov-
ing to table the amendment. It is also 
important to remember that both the 
evidence and witnesses are addressed in 
the underlying resolution. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amend-
ment is arguable by the parties for 2 
hours, equally divided. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF, are you a pro-
ponent or opponent of this motion? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Proponent, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, 
are you a proponent or opponent? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, we are an opponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
your side will proceed first, and you 
will be able to reserve time for rebut-
tal. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, before I begin, the House man-
agers will reserve the balance of our 
time to respond to the counsel for the 
President. 
Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel 
for the President, and the American 
people, I am JASON
CROW
from the 
great State of Colorado. 
The House managers strongly sup-
port this amendment to subpoena key 
documents from the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, or OMB. These docu-
ments go directly to one of President 
Trump’s abuses of power: his decision 
to withhold vital military aid from a 
strategic partner that is at war to ben-
efit his own personal reelection cam-
paign. Why should that matter? Why 
should anybody care? Why should I 
care? 
Before I was a Member of Congress, I 
was an American soldier serving in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. Although some 
years have passed since that time, 
there is still some memories that are 
seared in my brain. One of those memo-
ries was scavenging scrap metal on the 
streets of Baghdad in the summer of 
2003, which we had to bolt onto the side 
of our trucks because we had no armor 
to protect against roadside bombs. 
When we talk about troops not get-
ting the equipment they need, when 
they need it, it is personal to me. To be 
clear here, we are talking of $391 mil-
lion of taxpayer money intended to 
protect our national security by help-
ing our strategic partner, Ukraine, 
fight against Vladimir Putin’s Russia, 
an adversary of the United States. 
The President could not carry out 
this scheme alone. He needed a lot of 
people to help him. That is why we 
know as much about it as we do today. 
But there is much more to know. That 
is what trials are for, to get the full 
picture. 
We know there is more because Presi-
dent Trump needed the Office of Man-
agement and Budget to figure out how 
to stop what should have been a rou-
tine release of funds mandated by Con-
gress—a release of funds that was al-
ready under way. 
The people in this Chamber don’t 
need me to tell you that because 87 of 
you in this room voted for those vital 
funds to support our partner Ukraine. 
Witnesses before the House testified 
extensively about OMB’s involvement 
in carrying out the hold. It was OMB 
that relayed the President’s instruc-
tions and implemented them. It was 
OMB that scrambled to justify the 
freeze. 
OMB has key documents that Presi-
dent Trump has refused to turn over to 
Congress. It is time to subpoena those 
documents. These documents would 
provide insight into critical aspects of 
the military aid hold. They would show 
the decision-making process and moti-
vations 
behind 
President 
Trump’s 
freeze. They would reveal the concerns 
expressed by career OMB officials, in-
cluding lawyers, that the hold was vio-
lating the law. They would expose the 
lengths to which OMB went to justify 
the President’s hold. They would reveal 
concerns about the impact of the freeze 
on Ukraine and U.S. national security. 
They would show that senior officials 
repeatedly 
attempted 
to 
convince 
President Trump to release the hold. 
In short, they would show exactly 
how the President carried out the 
scheme to use our national defense 
funds to benefit his personal political 
campaign. 
We are not speculating about the ex-
istence of these documents. We are not 
guessing what the documents might 
show. During the course of the inves-
tigation in the House, witnesses who 
testified before the committees identi-
fied multiple documents directly rel-
evant to the impeachment inquiry that 
OMB continues to hold to this day. 
We know these documents exist, and 
we know that the only reason we do 
not have them is because the President 
directed OMB not to produce them be-
cause he knows what they would show. 
To demonstrate the significance of 
the OMB documents and the value they 
would provide in this trial, I would like 
to walk you through some of what we 
know exists for which the Trump ad-
ministration has refused to turn over. 
As we have discussed, the Trump ad-
ministration has refused to turn over 
any documents to the House in re-
sponse to multiple subpoenas and re-
quests. Based on what is known from 
the testimony and the few documents 
that have been obtained through public 
reporting and lawsuits, it is clear that 
the President is trying to hide this evi-
dence because he is afraid of what it 
would show. The documents offer stark 
examples of the chaos and confusion 
that the President’s scheme set off 
across our government and made clear 
the importance of the documents that 
are still being concealed by the Presi-
dent. 
We know that OMB has documents 
that reveal that as early as June, the 
President 
was 
considering 
holding 
military aid for Ukraine. The President 
began questioning military aid to 
Ukraine after Congress appropriated 
and authorized the money—$250 million 
in DOD funds and $140 million in State 
Department funds. This funding had 
wide bipartisan support because, as 
many witnesses testified, providing 
military aid to Ukraine to defend itself 
against Russian aggression also bene-
fits our own national security. Impor-
tantly, the President’s questions came 
weeks after the Department of Defense 
already certified that Ukraine had un-
dertaken the anti-corruption reforms 
and other measures mandated by Con-
gress as a condition for receiving that 
aid. There is a process for making sure 
that the funds make it to the right 
place and to the right people—a process 
that has been followed every year that 
we have been providing that security 
assistance to Ukraine, including the 
first 2 years under the Trump adminis-
tration. 
Nonetheless, the President’s ques-
tions came days after DOD issued a 
press release on June 18, announcing 
they would provide its $250 million por-
tion of the taxpayer-funded military 
aid to Ukraine. According to public re-
porting, the day after DOD’s press re-
lease, a White House official named 
Robert Blair called OMB’s Acting Di-
rector, Russell Vought, to talk about 
the military aid to Ukraine. According 
to 
public 
reports, 
Mr. 
Blair 
told 
Vought: ‘‘We need to hold it up.’’ 
OMB has refused to produce any doc-
uments related to this conversation. 
The Senate can get them by passing 
the amendment and issuing a sub-
poena. 
But there is more. The same day 
Blair told Vought to hold up the aid, 
Michael Duffey, a political appointee 
at 
OMB 
who 
reports 
to 
Vought, 
emailed Deputy Under Secretary of De-
fense Elaine McCusker and told her 
that the President had questions about 
the aid. Duffey copied Mark Sandy, a 
career official at OMB, who told us 
about the email in his testimony before 
the House. 
Like all others, that email was not 
produced by the Trump administration 
in the House impeachment investiga-
tion. We know this email exists, how-
ever, because in response to a Freedom 
of Information Act lawsuit, the Trump

January 21, 2020 
administration was forced to release a 
redacted email consistent with Sandy’s 
description. 
But OMB provided none of those doc-
uments to the House. With this pro-
posed amendment, the Senate has an 
opportunity to obtain and review the 
full record that can further dem-
onstrate how and why the President 
was holding the aid. These documents 
would also shed light on the Presi-
dent’s order to implement the hold. 
On July 3, the State Department told 
various officials that OMB blocked it 
from dispensing $141 million in aid. 
OMB had directed the State Depart-
ment not to send a notification to Con-
gress about spending the money, and 
without that notification, the aid was 
effectively blocked. Why did OMB 
block the congressional notification? 
Who told them to do it? What was the 
reason? The Senate would get those an-
swers if it issued this subpoena. 
But there is more. On July 12, Blair— 
the White House official who had called 
Vought on June 19 and said ‘‘We need 
to hold it up’’—sent an email to Duffey 
at OMB. Blair said: ‘‘The President is 
directing a hold on military support 
funding for Ukraine.’’ 
We haven’t seen this email. The only 
reason we know about it is from the 
testimony of Mark Sandy, the career 
OMB official who followed the law and 
complied with his subpoena. As you 
can see from the transcript excerpt in 
front of you, Sandy testified that the 
July 12 email did not mention concerns 
about any other country or any other 
aid packages, just Ukraine. So of the 
dozens of countries we provide aid and 
support for, the President was only 
concerned about one of them—Ukraine. 
Why? Well, we know why. But OMB has 
still refused to provide a copy of this 
July 12 email and has refused to pro-
vide any documents surrounding it, all 
because the President told OMB to con-
tinue to hide the truth from Congress 
and the American people. 
What was he afraid of? A subpoena 
issued by the Senate would show us. 
OMB also has documents about a key 
series of meetings triggered by the 
President’s order to hold military aid. 
In the second half of July, the National 
Security Council convened a series of 
interagency meetings about the Presi-
dent’s hold on military aid. OMB docu-
ments would show what happened dur-
ing those meetings. For example, on 
July 18, the National Security Council 
staff convened a routine interagency 
meeting to discuss Ukraine policy. 
During the meeting, it was the OMB 
representative who announced that 
President Trump placed a hold on all 
military aid to Ukraine. 
Ambassador Bill Taylor, our most 
senior diplomat to Ukraine, partici-
pated in that meeting, and he described 
his reaction at his own hearing. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. TAYLOR. In a regular NSC secure 
video conference call on July 18, I heard a 
staff person from the Office of Management 
and Budget say that there was a hold on se-
curity assistance to Ukraine but could not 
say why. Toward the end of an otherwise 
normal meeting, a voice on the call—the per-
son was off-screen—said that she was from 
OMB and her boss had instructed her not to 
approve any additional spending on security 
assistance for Ukraine until further notice. 
I and others sat in astonishment. The 
Ukrainians were fighting the Russians and 
counted on not only the training and weap-
ons but also the assurance of U.S. support. 
All that the OMB staff person said was that 
the directive had come from the President, 
to the Chief of Staff, to OMB. In an instant, 
I realized that one of the key pillars of our 
strong support for Ukraine was threatened. 
Mr. Manager CROW. It is hard to be-
lieve OMB would not have any docu-
ments following this bombshell an-
nouncement. It surely does. It was the 
agency that delivered the shocking 
news to the rest of the U.S. Govern-
ment that the President was with-
holding the vital military aid from our 
partner, and we would see these docu-
ments if the Senate issued a subpoena. 
The July 18 meeting was just the 
first in a series of meetings where OMB 
held the line and enforced the Presi-
dent’s hold on the aid. But there was a 
second meeting on July 23, where we 
understood agencies raised concerns 
about the legality of OMB’s hold on the 
aid and then a third meeting, at a more 
senior level, on July 26. Witnesses tes-
tified that at that meeting, OMB strug-
gled to offer an explanation for the 
President’s hold on the aid. Then there 
was a fourth meeting on July 31, where 
the legal concerns about the hold were 
raised. At each of these meetings, there 
was confusion about the scope and the 
reasons for the hold. Nobody seemed to 
know what was going on. But that was 
exactly the point. 
All of the agencies—except OMB, 
which was simply conveying the Presi-
dent’s order—supported the military 
aid and argued for lifting the hold. 
OMB did not produce a single docu-
ment providing information about his 
participation, preparation, or followup 
from any of these meetings. 
Did these OMB officials come pre-
pared with talking points for these 
meetings? Did OMB officials take notes 
during any of these meetings? Did they 
exchange emails about what was going 
on? Did OMB discuss what reasons they 
could give everyone else for the hold? 
By issuing this subpoena, the Senate 
can find out the answers to all of those 
questions and others like them. The 
American people deserve answers. 
OMB documents would also reveal 
key facts about what happened on July 
25. On July 25, President Trump con-
ducted his phone call with President 
Zelensky, during which he demanded 
‘‘a favor.’’ This favor was for Ukraine 
to conduct an investigation to benefit 
the President’s reelection campaign. 
That call was at 9 a.m. Just 90 minutes 
after President Trump hung up the 
phone, Duffey, the political appointee 
at OMB who is in charge of national se-
curity programs, emailed DOD to ‘‘for-
malize’’ the hold on the military aid, 
just 
90 
minutes 
after 
President 
Trump’s call—a call in which the Presi-
dent had asked for ‘‘a favor.’’ 
That email is on the screen in front 
of you. We have a redacted copy of this 
email because it was recently released 
through the Freedom of Information 
Act. It was not released by the Trump 
administration 
in 
response 
to 
the 
House’s subpoena. 
In this email, Duffey told DOD offi-
cials that, based on the guidance it re-
ceived, they should ‘‘hold off on any 
additional DOD obligations of these 
funds.’’ He added that the request was 
‘‘sensitive’’ and that they should keep 
this information ‘‘closely held,’’ mean-
ing, don’t tell anybody about it. 
Why did Duffey consider the informa-
tion sensitive? Why didn’t he want 
anyone to learn about it? Answers to 
those questions may be found in OMB 
emails—emails that we could all see if 
you issue a subpoena. 
But there is more. Remember, the ad-
ministration needed to create a way to 
stop funding that was already under-
way. The train had already left the sta-
tion and something like this had never 
been done before. Later in the evening 
of July 25, OMB found a way, even 
though DOD had already notified Con-
gress that the funds would be released. 
Here is how this scheme worked. 
OMB sent DOD a funding document 
that included a carefully worded foot-
note directing DOD to hold off on 
spending the funds ‘‘to allow for an 
interagency process to determine the 
best use.’’ Remember that language, 
‘‘to allow for an interagency process to 
determine the best use.’’ 
Let me explain that. The footnote 
stated that this ‘‘brief pause’’ would 
not prevent DOD from spending the 
money by the end of the fiscal year, 
which was coming up on September 30. 
OMB had to do this because it knew 
that not spending the money was ille-
gal, and they knew that DOD would be 
worried about that. And they were 
right; DOD was worried about it. Mr. 
Sandy testified that in his 12 years of 
experience at OMB, he could not recall 
anything like this ever happening be-
fore. The drafting of this unusual fund-
ing document and the issuance of the 
document must have generated a sig-
nificant 
amount 
of 
email 
traffic, 
memos, and other documentation at 
OMB—memos, email traffic, and docu-
mentation that we would all see if the 
Senate issued a subpoena. 
What was the result from this series 
of events on July 25? Where was Mr. 
Duffey’s guidance to implement the 
hold coming from? Why was the re-
quest ‘‘sensitive’’? What was the con-
nection between OMB’s direction to 
DOD and the call President Trump had 
with President Zelensky just 90 min-
utes before? Did agency officials com-
municate about the questions coming 
from Ukrainian officials? 
The American people deserve an-
swers. A subpoena would provide those 
answers. 
OMB documents also would reveal in-
formation about the decision to have a 
political appointee take over Ukraine 
funding responsibility. The tensions

and chaos surrounding the freeze esca-
lated at the end of July, when Duffey, 
a political appointee at OMB with no 
relevant experience in funding approv-
als, took authority for releasing mili-
tary aid to Ukraine away from Sandy, 
a career OMB official. Sandy could 
think of no other explanation of a po-
litical appointee’s taking on this re-
sponsibility. Sandy was given no rea-
son other than Mr. Duffey wanted to be 
‘‘more involved in daily operations.’’ 
During his deposition, Sandy con-
firmed that he was removed from the 
funding approval process after he had 
raised concerns to Duffey about wheth-
er the hold was legal under the Im-
poundment Control Act. Needless to 
say, OMB has refused to turn over any 
documents or communications involv-
ing that decision to replace Mr. Sandy. 
Why 
did 
Duffey—a 
political 
ap-
pointee with no relevant experience in 
this area—take over responsibility for 
Ukraine’s funding approval? Was the 
White House involved in that decision? 
Was Sandy removed because he had ex-
pressed concerns about the legality of 
the hold? 
By August 7, people in our govern-
ment were worried, and when people in 
the government get worried, some-
times what they do is they draft 
memos, because when they are con-
cerned about getting caught up in 
something that doesn’t seem right, 
they don’t want to be a part of it. 
So, on that day, Mark Sandy and 
other colleagues at the OMB drafted 
and sent a memo about Ukraine mili-
tary aid to Acting Director Vought. 
According to Sandy, the memo advo-
cated for the release of the funds. It 
said that the military aid was con-
sistent with American national secu-
rity interests, that it would help to op-
pose Russian aggression, and that it 
was backed by strong bipartisan sup-
port. But President Trump did not lift 
the hold. 
Over the next several weeks, the 
OMB continued to issue funding docu-
ments that kept kicking the can down 
the road, supposedly to allow for more 
of this ‘‘interagency process’’ while in-
serting those footnotes throughout the 
apportionment documents, stating that 
the delay wouldn’t affect the funding. 
But here is the really shocking part: 
There was no interagency process. 
They made it up. It had ended months 
before. They made it up because no-
body could say the real reason for the 
hold. In total, the OMB issued nine of 
these documents between July 25 and 
September 10. 
Did the White House respond to the 
OMB’s concerns and recommendation 
to release the aid? Did the White House 
instruct the OMB to continue creating 
a paper trail in an effort to justify the 
hold? Who knew what and when the 
OMB documents would shed light on 
the OMB’s actions as the President’s 
scheme 
unraveled? 
Did 
the 
White 
House direct the OMB to continue 
issuing the hold? What was OMB told 
about the President’s reasons for re-
leasing the hold? What communica-
tions did the OMB officials have with 
the White House around the time of the 
release? As the President’s scheme un-
raveled, did anyone at the OMB con-
nect the dots for the real reason for the 
hold? The OMB documents would shed 
light on all of these questions, and the 
American people deserve answers. 
I remember what it feels like to not 
have the equipment you need when you 
need it. Real people’s lives are at 
stake. That is why this matters. We 
need this information so we can ensure 
that this never happens again. Eventu-
ally, this will all come out. We will 
have answers to these questions. The 
question now is whether we will have 
them in time and who here will be on 
the right side of history. 
I reserve the balance of our time for 
an opportunity to respond to the Presi-
dent’s argument. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the 
Senate. 
Manager CROW, you should be happy 
to know that the aid that was provided 
to Ukraine over the course of the 
present administration included lethal 
weapons. Those were not provided by 
the previous administration. The sug-
gestion that Ukraine failed to get any 
equipment is false. The security assist-
ance was not for funding Ukraine over 
the summer of 2019. There was no lack 
of equipment due to the temporary 
pause. It was for future funding. 
Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of De-
fense, who oversaw the U.S. aid ship-
ment, said: ‘‘The hold went and came 
so quickly they did not notice any 
change.’’ 
Under Secretary of State David Hale 
explained: ‘‘The pause to aid was for fu-
ture assistance, not to keep the army 
going now.’’ 
So the made-up narrative that secu-
rity assistance was conditioned on 
Ukraine’s taking some action on inves-
tigations is further disproved by the 
straightforward fact that the aid was 
delivered on September 11, 2019, with-
out Ukraine’s taking any action on any 
investigation. 
It is interesting to note that the 
Obama administration withheld $585 
million of promised aid to Egypt in 
2013, but the administration’s public 
message was that the money was not 
officially on hold as, technically, it 
was not due until September 30—the 
end of the fiscal year—so that then 
they didn’t have to disclose the halt to 
anyone. 
It sounds like this may be a practice 
of a number of administrations. In fact, 
this President has been concerned 
about how aid is being put forward, so 
there have been pauses on foreign aid 
in a variety of contexts. 
In September of 2019, the administra-
tion announced that it was withholding 
over $100 million in aid to Afghanistan 
over concerns about government cor-
ruption. In August of 2019, President 
Trump announced that the administra-
tion and Seoul were in talks to sub-
stantially increase South Korea’s share 
of the expense of U.S. military support 
for South Korea. In June, President 
Trump cut or paused over $550 million 
in foreign aid to El Salvador, Hon-
duras, and Guatemala because those 
countries were not fairly sharing the 
burden of preventing mass migration 
to the United States. 
It is not the only administration. As 
I said, President Obama withheld hun-
dreds of millions of dollars of aid to 
Egypt. 
To be clear—and I want to be clear— 
Ambassador Yovanovitch herself testi-
fied that our policy actually got 
stronger under President Trump, large-
ly because, unlike the Obama adminis-
tration, ‘‘this administration made the 
decision to provide lethal weapons to 
Ukraine to help Ukraine fend off Rus-
sian aggression.’’ She testified in a dep-
osition before your various committees 
that it actually had felt, ‘‘in the 3 
years that I was there, partly because 
of my efforts but also the interagency 
team and President Trump’s decision 
to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, 
that our policy actually got stronger.’’ 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent, 
whose name has come up a couple of 
times, agrees that Javelins are incred-
ibly effective weapons at stopping ad-
vance and that the Russians are scared 
of them. 
Ambassador Volker explained that 
President Trump approved each of the 
decisions made along the way, and as a 
result, 
America’s 
policy 
toward 
Ukraine strengthened. 
So when we want to talk about facts, 
go to your own discovery and your own 
witnesses that you called. 
This all supposedly started because 
of a whistleblower. Where is that whis-
tleblower? 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House 
managers have 35 minutes remaining. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, in war, time matters; minutes and 
hours can seem like years. So the idea 
that, well, it made it there eventually 
just doesn’t work. And, yes, the aid was 
provided. It was provided by Congress— 
this Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives—with the President’s sig-
nature. The Congress is the one that 
sends the aid, and millions of dollars of 
this aid would have been lost because 
of the delay had Congress not actually 
passed another law that extended that 
deadline to allow the funds to be spent. 
Let me repeat that. The delay had 
jeopardized the expenditure of the 
money to such an extent that Congress 
had to pass another law to extend the 
deadline so that the money and the 
equipment got to the people on the 
frontlines. 
Need I also reiterate, as to the sup-
posed interagency process—the con-
cerns that the President and his coun-
sel continue to raise about corruption 
and making sure that the process went 
right—there was no interagency proc-
ess. The whole thing was made up. It

was a phantom. There was a delay, and 
delays matter. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time for Mr. SCHIFF. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
There are just a few additional points 
I would like to make on this amend-
ment and on my colleagues’ argu-
ments. 
First of all, Mr. Sekulow makes the 
point that the aid ultimately got re-
leased. They ultimately got the money, 
right? Yes, they got the money after 
the President got caught, after the 
President was forced to relieve the hold 
on the aid. After he got caught, yes, 
but even then, they had held on to the 
aid so long that it took a subsequent 
act of Congress to make sure it could 
all go out the door. 
So, what, is the President supposed 
to get credit for that—that we had to 
intervene because he withheld the aid 
for so long and that this is the only 
reason Ukraine got all of the aid we 
had approved in the first place? 
My colleagues have glossed over the 
fact that what they did was illegal, 
that the GAO—independent watchdog 
agency—found that that hold was ille-
gal. So it not only violated the law, it 
not only took an act of Congress to 
make sure they ultimately got the aid, 
but this is supposed to be the defense 
as to why you shouldn’t see the docu-
ments? Is that what we are to believe? 
Now, counsel also says, well, he is 
not the first President to withhold aid. 
And that is true. After all, counsel 
says: Well, President Obama withheld 
aid to Egypt. Yes. It was at the urging 
of the Members of Congress. Senators 
McCain and GRAHAM urged that that 
aid be withheld. And why? Because 
there was a revolution in Egypt after it 
was appropriated. It was not something 
that was hidden from Congress. That 
was a pretty darned good reason to 
think, do we still want to give aid to 
this government after this revolution? 
We are not saying that aid has never 
been withheld—that is absurd—but I 
would hope and expect this is the first 
time aid has been withheld by a Presi-
dent of the United States to coerce an 
ally at war to help him cheat in the 
next election. I think that is a first, 
but what we do here may determine 
whether it is the last. 
There is one other thing about this 
pause in aid, right? It is the argument: 
Well, no harm, no foul. OK. You got 
caught. They got the aid. What is the 
big deal? 
Well, as we heard during the trial, it 
is not just the aid. Aid is obviously the 
most important thing, as Mr. CROW 
mentioned—you know, without it, you 
can’t defend yourself—and we will have 
testimony as to just what kind of mili-
tary aid the President was with-
holding. But we also had testimony 
that it was the fact of the aid itself 
that was so important to Ukraine, the 
fact 
that 
the 
United 
States 
had 
Ukraine’s back. And why? Because this 
new President of Ukraine—this new, 
untested, former comedian President of 
Ukraine who was at war with Russia 
was going to be going into a negotia-
tion with Vladimir Putin with an eye 
to ending that conflict, and whether he 
went into that negotiation from a posi-
tion of strength or a position of weak-
ness would depend on whether we had 
his back. 
And so when the Ukrainians learned 
and the Russians learned that the 
President of the United States did not 
have his back, was withholding this 
aid, what message do you think that 
sent to Vladimir Putin? What message 
do you think it sent to Vladimir Putin 
when 
Donald 
Trump 
wouldn’t 
let 
Volodymyr Zelensky, our ally, in the 
door at the White House but would let 
the Russian Foreign Minister? What 
message does that send? 
So it is not just the aid, and it is not 
just when the aid is delivered, it is not 
just if all of the aid is delivered, it is 
also what message does the freeze send 
to our friend and, even more impor-
tantly, to our foe, and the message it 
sent was a disaster—was a disaster. 
Now, you might ask yourself because 
counselors said: Hey, President Trump 
has given lethal weapons to Ukraine— 
you might ask yourself, if the Presi-
dent was so concerned about corrup-
tion, why didn’t he do that in 2017, and 
why didn’t he do that in 2018? Why was 
it only 2019 that there was a problem? 
Was there no corruption in Ukraine in 
2017? Was there no corruption in 
Ukraine in 2018? 
No. Ukraine has always battled cor-
ruption. It wasn’t the presence or lack 
of corruption in one year to another; it 
was the presence of Joe Biden as a po-
tential candidate for President. That 
was the key change in 2019. That made 
all the difference. 
Let’s get back to one of the key mo-
ments in this saga. A lot of you are at-
torneys—you are probably much better 
attorneys than I am—and I am sure 
you had the experience in cases you 
tried where there was some vignette, 
some conversation, some document. It 
may not have been the most important 
on its face, but it told you something 
about the case that was much larger 
than that conversation. 
For me, one of those conversations 
was not on July 25 between President 
Trump and President Zelensky but on 
July 26, the very next day. 
Now, you may have watched some of 
the House proceedings or you may not 
have, and people watching may have 
seen it and maybe they didn’t, but 
there is this scene in a Ukrainian res-
taurant—a restaurant in Kyiv—with 
Gordon Sondland. Now, bear in mind it 
was Gordon Sondland who said there 
was absolutely quid pro quo and two 
plus two equals four. This is not some 
Never Trumper. This is a million-dollar 
donor to the Trump inauguration. OK? 
If there is a bias there, it is clearly in 
a million-dollar bias in favor of this 
President, not against him. 
So there is the scene in Kyiv, in this 
restaurant. Sondland has a cell phone, 
and he is sitting with David Holmes, 
who is a career diplomat—U.S. dip-
lomat—in the Ukraine Embassy. Gor-
don Sondland takes out his phone, and 
he calls the White House. Gordon 
Sondland calling for the White House. 
Gordon Sondland holding for the Presi-
dent. And it takes a while to be con-
nected, but he is connected to the 
President. That is pretty impressive, 
right? This isn’t some guy with no re-
lationship to the President. The Presi-
dent may say: Gordon Sondland, I bare-
ly know him, or something to that ef-
fect, but this is a guy who picked up 
his cell phone, and he can call the 
President of the United States from a 
restaurant in Kyiv, and he does. 
And the President’s voice is so loud 
that David Holmes, this diplomat, can 
hear it. And what does the President 
say? Does he say: How is that reform 
coming? How is the attack on corrup-
tion going? 
No. He just says: Is he going to do the 
investigation? Is Zelensky going to do 
the investigation? And Sondland says: 
Yes. He will do anything you want. He 
loves your ass. 
This is the extent of the President’s 
interest in Ukraine. They go on to talk 
about other things, and then they hang 
up. And David Holmes turns to the Am-
bassador and says—in language which I 
will have to modify to remove an ex-
pletive—says something along the lines 
of: Does the President give a ‘‘blank’’ 
about Ukraine? And Sondland says: No. 
He doesn’t give a ‘‘blank’’ about 
Ukraine. He only cares about the big 
stuff, like the investigation of the 
Bidens that Giuliani wants. 
This is a million-dollar donor to the 
Trump inaugural admitting the Presi-
dent doesn’t care about Ukraine. He 
doesn’t care whether they get military 
dollars 
to 
defend 
themselves. 
He 
doesn’t 
care 
about 
what 
position 
Zelensky goes into in these negotia-
tions with Putin. He doesn’t care about 
that. 
Isn’t that clear? It is why he didn’t 
care about corruption in 2017 or 2018, 
and he certainly didn’t care about it in 
2019. All he cared about was the big 
stuff that affected him personally, like 
this investigation that he wanted of 
the Bidens. 
So we do ask: Do you want to see 
these documents? Do you want to know 
if these documents corroborate Ambas-
sador Sondland? Will the documents 
show, as we fully expect they will, that 
the only thing he cared about was the 
big stuff that affected him? 
David Holmes’ response was: Well, 
you know, there is some big stuff going 
on here, like the war with Russia. This 
isn’t withholding aid because of a revo-
lution in Egypt. This is withholding 
aid from a country in which 15,000 peo-
ple have died fighting the Russians, 
and as Ambassador Taylor said and 
others: You know, Russia is fighting to 
remake the map of Europe by dint of 
military force. 
If we think that is just about 
Ukraine’s security, we are very de-
ceived. It is about our security. It is

about the tens of thousands of troops 
we have in Europe. And if we undercut 
our own ally, if we give Russia reason 
to believe we will not have their back, 
that we will use Ukraine as a play 
thing or worse to get them to help us 
cheat in an election, that will only em-
bolden Putin to do more. 
You said it as often as I have—the 
only thing he respects is strength. You 
think that looks like strength to 
Vladimir Putin? I think that looks like 
something that Vladimir Putin is only 
too accustomed to, and that is the kind 
of corruption that he finds and perpet-
uates in his own regime and pushes all 
around the world. 
My colleague VAL DEMINGS made ref-
erence to a conversation which I think 
is one of the other key vignettes in this 
whole sad saga, and that is a conversa-
tion that Ambassador Volker had with 
Andriy Yermak, one of the top aides to 
President Zelensky. 
This is a conversation in which Am-
bassador Volker is doing exactly what 
he is supposed to be doing, which is he 
is telling Yermak: You know, you guys 
shouldn’t really do this investigation 
of your former President Poroshenko 
because it would be for a political rea-
son. You really shouldn’t engage in po-
litical investigations. And as Rep-
resentative DEMINGS said: What is the 
response of the Ukrainians? Oh, you 
mean like the one you want us to do of 
the Bidens and the Clintons. Threw it 
right back in his face. Ukraine is not 
oblivious to that hypocrisy. 
Mr. Sekulow says: What are we here 
for? You know, part of our strength is 
not only our support for our allies, it is 
not only our military might, it is what 
we stand for. 
We used to stand for the rule of law. 
We used to champion the rule of law 
around the world. Part of the rule of 
law is, of course, that no one is above 
the law. 
But to be out in Ukraine or anywhere 
else in the world championing the rule 
of law and saying don’t engage in polit-
ical prosecutions and having them 
throw it right back in our face: Oh, you 
mean like the one you want us to do— 
that is why we are here. That is why 
we are here. That is why we are here. 
I yield back.

The CHIEF JUSTICE. On this vote, 
the yeas are 53, the nays are 47. The 
motion to table is agreed to; the 
amendment is tabled. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Demo-
cratic leader is recognized. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1287 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send an amendment to the desk to 
issue a subpoena to John Michael 
‘‘Mick’’ Mulvaney, and I ask that it be 
read. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHUMER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1287. 
(Purpose: To subpoena John Michael ‘‘Mick’’ 
Mulvaney) 
At the appropriate place in the resolving 
clause, insert the following: 
SEC. lll. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this resolution, pursuant to 
rules V and VI of the Rules of Procedure and 
Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Im-
peachment Trials, the Chief Justice of the 
United States, through the Secretary of the 
Senate, shall issue a subpoena for the taking 
of 
testimony 
of 
John 
Michael 
‘‘Mick’’ 
Mulvaney, and the Sergeant at Arms is au-
thorized to utilize the services of the Deputy 
Sergeant at Arms or any other employee of 
the Senate in serving the subpoena author-
ized to be issued by this section. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent for a 30- 
minute recess before the parties are 
recognized to debate the Schumer 
amendment. 
Following the debate time, I will 
once again move to table the amend-
ment because those witnesses and evi-
dence, as I repeatedly said, are ad-
dressed in the underlying resolution. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate stand in recess until 8 p.m. 
There being no objection, at 7:31 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 8:13 p.m. 
and reassembled when called to order 
by the Presiding Officer, the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, are 
you in favor of the motion or opposed? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. In favor, Your 
Honor. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. We are op-
posed. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
the managers will go first and are able 
to reserve time for rebuttal. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, counsel for the President, my 
name is HAKEEM JEFFRIES, and I have 
the honor of representing the 8th Con-
gressional District of New York, in 
Brooklyn and Queens. It is one of the 
most diverse districts in the Nation. In 
fact, I have been told that I have the 
9th most African-American district in 
the country and the 16th most Jewish. 
Here on the Hill, some folks have 
said: Hakeem, is that complicated? 
But as my friend Leon Goldenberg 
says back at home: Hakeem, you have 
the best of both worlds. 
You see, in America, our diversity is 
a strength; it is not a weakness. And 
one of the things that binds us to-
gether—all of us—as Americans, re-
gardless of race, regardless of religion, 
regardless of region, regardless of sex-
ual orientation, and regardless of gen-
der is that we believe in the rule of law 
and the importance of a fair trial. 
The House managers strongly sup-
port this amendment to subpoena wit-
ness testimony, including with respect 
to Mick Mulvaney. 
Who has ever heard of a trial with no 
witnesses? But that is exactly what 
some are contemplating here today. 
This amendment would address that 
fundamental flaw. It would ensure that 
the trial includes testimony from a key 
witness: the President’s Acting Chief of 
Staff and head of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, and 
it would ensure that the Senate can 
consider his testimony immediately. 
Let’s discuss why the need to hear 
from Mick Mulvaney is so critical. 
First, Leader MCCONNELL’s resolu-
tion undercuts more than 200 years of 
Senate impeachment trial practice. It 
departs from every impeachment trial 
conducted to date. It goes against the 
Senate’s own longstanding impeach-
ment rules, which contemplate the pos-
sibility of new witness testimony. In 
fact, it departs from any criminal or 
civil trial procedure in America. Why 
should this President be held to a dif-
ferent standard? 
Second, the proposed amendment for 
witness testimony is necessary in light 
of the President’s determined effort to 
bury the evidence and cover up his cor-
rupt abuse of power.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S407 
January 21, 2020 
The 
House 
tried 
to 
get 
Mr. 
Mulvaney’s testimony. We subpoenaed 
him. Mr. Mulvaney, together with 
other key witnesses—National Secu-
rity Advisor John Bolton, senior White 
House aide Robert Blair, Office of Man-
agement and Budget official Michael 
Duffey, and National Security Council 
lawyer John Eisenberg—were called to 
testify before the House as part of this 
impeachment inquiry, but President 
Trump was determined to hide from 
the American people what they had to 
say. The President directed the entire 
executive branch and all of his top 
aides and advisers to defy all requests 
for their testimony. That cannot be al-
lowed to stand. 
Third, Mr. Mulvaney is a highly rel-
evant witness to the events at issue in 
this trial. Mr. Mulvaney was at the 
center of every stage of the President’s 
substantial pressure campaign against 
Ukraine. Based on the extensive evi-
dence the House did obtain, it is clear 
that Mulvaney was crucial in planning 
the scheme, executing its implementa-
tion, and carrying out the coverup. 
Emails and witness testimony show 
that Mr. Mulvaney was in the loop on 
the President’s decision to explicitly 
condition a White House meeting on 
Ukraine’s announcement of investiga-
tions beneficial to the President’s re-
election prospects. 
He was closely involved in imple-
menting the President’s hold on the se-
curity assistance and subsequently ad-
mitted that the funds were being with-
held to put pressure on Ukraine to con-
duct one of the phony political inves-
tigations that the President wanted— 
phony political investigations. 
A trial would not be complete with-
out the testimony of Mick Mulvaney. 
Make no mistake. The evidentiary 
record that we have built is powerful 
and can clearly establish the Presi-
dent’s guilt on both of the Articles of 
Impeachment, but it is hardly com-
plete. The record comes to you without 
the testimony of Mr. Mulvaney and 
other important witnesses. 
That brings me to one final prelimi-
nary observation. The American people 
agree that there cannot be a fair trial 
without hearing from witnesses who 
have relevant information to provide. 
The Constitution, our democracy, the 
Senate, the President and, most impor-
tantly, the American people deserve a 
fair trial. A fair trial requires wit-
nesses in order to provide the truth, 
the whole truth, and nothing but the 
truth. That is why this amendment 
should be adopted. 
Before we discuss Mr. Mulvaney’s 
knowledge 
of 
the 
President’s 
geo-
political shakedown, it is important to 
note that an impeachment trial with-
out witnesses would be a stunning de-
parture from this institution’s past 
practice. 
This distinguished body has con-
ducted 15 impeachment trials. All have 
included witnesses. Sometimes those 
trials included just a handful of wit-
nesses, as indicated on the screen. At 
other times, they included dozens. In 
one case, there were over 100 different 
witnesses. 
As the slide shows, the average num-
ber of witnesses to appear at a Senate 
impeachment trial is 33, and in at least 
3 of those instances, including the im-
peachment of Bill Clinton, witnesses 
appeared before the Senate who had 
not previously appeared before the 
House. That is because the Senate, this 
great institution, has always taken its 
responsibility to administer a fair trial 
seriously. The Senate has always taken 
its duty to obtain evidence, including 
witness testimony, seriously. The Sen-
ate has always taken its obligation to 
evaluate the President’s conduct based 
on a full body of available information 
seriously. This is the only way to en-
sure fundamental fairness for everyone 
involved. 
Respectfully, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
honor that unbroken precedent today 
so that Mr. Mulvaney’s testimony, 
without fear or favor as to what he 
might say, can inform this distin-
guished body of Americans. 
This amendment is also important to 
counter the President’s determination 
to bury the evidence of high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
As we have explained in detail today, 
despite considerable efforts by the 
House to obtain relevant documents 
and testimony, President Trump has 
directed the entire executive branch to 
execute a coverup. He has ordered the 
entire administration to ignore the 
powers of Congress’s separate and co-
equal branch of government to inves-
tigate his offenses in a manner that is 
unprecedented in American history. 
There were 71 requests by the House 
for relevant evidence. In response, the 
White House produced zero documents 
in this impeachment inquiry—71 re-
quests, 0 documents. 
President Trump is personally re-
sponsible for depriving the Senate of 
information important to consider in 
this trial. This point cannot be over-
stated. When faced with a congres-
sional impeachment inquiry, a process 
expressly set forth by the Framers of 
the Constitution in article I, the Presi-
dent refused to comply in any respect, 
and he ordered his senior aides to fall 
in line. 
As shown on the slide, as a result of 
President Trump’s obstruction, 12 key 
witnesses, including Mr. Mulvaney, re-
fused to appear for testimony in the 
House’s impeachment inquiry. No one 
has heard what they have to say. These 
witnesses include central figures in the 
abuse of power charged in article I. 
What is the President hiding? 
Equally 
troublesome, 
President 
Trump and his administration did not 
make any legitimate attempts to reach 
a reasonable accommodation with the 
House or compromise regarding any 
document requests or witness sub-
poenas. Why? Because President Don-
ald John Trump wasn’t interested in 
cooperating. He was plotting a coverup. 
It is important to take a step back 
and think about what President Trump 
is doing. Complete and total Presi-
dential obstruction is unprecedented in 
American 
history. 
Even 
President 
Nixon, whose Articles of Impeachment 
included obstruction of Congress, did 
not block key White House aides from 
testifying in front of Congress during 
the Senate Watergate hearings. In fact, 
he publicly urged White House aides to 
testify. 
Remember all of those witnesses who 
came in front of this body? Take a look 
at the screen. John Dean, the former 
White House Counsel, testified for mul-
tiple days pursuant to a subpoena. H.R. 
Haldeman, President Nixon’s former 
Chief of Staff, was subpoenaed and tes-
tified. Alexander Butterfield, the White 
House official who revealed the exist-
ence of the tapes, testified publicly be-
fore the Senate, and so did several oth-
ers. President Trump’s complete and 
total obstruction makes Richard Nixon 
look like a choirboy. 
Two other Presidents have been tried 
before the Senate. How did they con-
duct themselves? 
William Jefferson Clinton and An-
drew Johnson did not block any wit-
nesses from participating in the Senate 
trial. President Trump, by contrast, re-
fuses to permit relevant witnesses from 
testifying to this very day. 
Many of President Clinton’s White 
House aides testified in front of Con-
gress, even before the commencement 
of 
formal 
impeachment 
profession. 
During various investigations in the 
mid-1990s, the House and the Senate 
heard from more than two dozen White 
House aides, including the White House 
Counsel, the former Chief of Staff, and 
multiple senior advisers to President 
Clinton. 
President Clinton himself gave testi-
mony on camera and under oath. He 
also allowed his most senior advisers, 
including multiple Chiefs of Staff and 
White House Counsels, to testify in the 
investigation that led to his impeach-
ment. 
As you can see in the chart, their tes-
timony was packaged and delivered to 
the Senate. There were no missing wit-
nesses who had defied subpoenas. No 
aides who had personal knowledge of 
his misconduct were directed to stay 
silent by President Clinton. 
We have an entirely different situa-
tion in this case. Here we are seeking 
witnesses the President has blocked 
from testifying before the House. Ap-
parently, President Trump thinks he 
can do what no other President before 
him has attempted to do in such a bra-
zen fashion: float above the law and 
hide the truth from the American peo-
ple. That cannot be allowed to stand. 
Let me now address some bedrock 
principles about the Congress’s author-
ity to conduct investigations. Our 
broad powers of inquiry are at their 
strongest during an impeachment pro-
ceeding, when the House and Senate 
exercise responsibilities expressly set 
forth in article I of the Constitution. 
Nearly 140 years ago, the Supreme 
Court recognized that, when the House

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S408 
January 21, 2020 
or Senate is determining a question of 
impeachment, there is no reason to 
doubt the right to compel the attend-
ance of witnesses, and their answer to 
proper questions, in the same manner 
and by the use of the same means that 
courts of justice can in like cases. Our 
Nation’s Founders and greatest legal 
minds recognized these principles early 
on. Supreme Court Justice Joseph 
Story explained that the President 
should not have the power of pre-
venting a thorough investigation of his 
conduct or of securing himself against 
the disgrace of a public conviction by 
impeachment, if he should deserve it. 
President Trump cannot function as 
judge, jury, and executioner of our de-
mocracy. It wasn’t just the courts that 
confirmed this for us. It was some of 
our Nation’s leading public servants. 
Representative John Quincy Adams, 
speaking on the floor of the House, 
after he had served as President, once 
explained: ‘‘What mockery would it be 
for the Constitution of the United 
States to say that the House should 
have the power of impeachment, ex-
tending even to the President of the 
United States himself, and yet to say 
that the House had not the power to 
obtain the evidence and proofs on 
which their impeachment was based.’’ 
As Hamilton, Story, Adams, and oth-
ers have recognized, the President can-
not insulate himself from Congress’s 
investigations of his wrongdoing. If the 
President could decide what evidence 
gets to be presented in his own trial, 
that would fundamentally nullify the 
constitutional power of impeachment. 
This amendment is important be-
cause President Trump simply cannot 
be allowed to hide the truth. No other 
President has done it; the Supreme 
Court does not allow it; and the Presi-
dent is not above the law. 
Witnesses matter. Documents mat-
ter. Evidence matters. The truth mat-
ters. 
Let me now turn to the third jus-
tification for this amendment. Mr. 
Mulvaney’s testimony is critical to 
considering the case for removal. It is 
imperative that we hear from the 
President’s closest aide, a man inti-
mately involved at key stages of this 
extraordinary abuse of power. Presi-
dent Trump knows this. Why else 
would he be trying so hard to prevent 
Mick Mulvaney from testifying before 
you? 
There are at least four reasons why 
Mr. Mulvaney’s testimony is critical. 
To begin with, as Acting White House 
Chief of Staff and head of the Office of 
Management 
and 
Budget, 
Mick 
Mulvaney 
has 
firsthand 
knowledge 
about President Trump’s efforts to 
shake down Ukraine and pressure its 
new President into announcing phony 
investigations. 
Mr. Mulvaney was in the loop at each 
critical stage of President Trump’s 
scheme. He was in the loop in the plan-
ning of the scheme; he was in the loop 
in its implementation; and he was in 
the loop when the scheme fell apart. He 
even admitted publicly that the aid 
was withheld in order to pressure 
Ukraine into announcing an investiga-
tion designed to elevate the President’s 
political standing. 
Mr. Mulvaney, perhaps more than 
any other administration witness, ex-
cepting the President, has firsthand in-
sight into the decision to withhold $391 
million in military and security aid to 
a vulnerable Ukraine without justifica-
tion. Indeed, our investigation revealed 
that President Trump personally or-
dered Mr. Mulvaney to execute the 
freeze in July of 2019. Mr. Mulvaney 
holds the senior-most staff position at 
the White House. He is a member of 
President Trump’s Cabinet, and he is 
responsible for President Trump’s team 
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He re-
mains the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, which imple-
mented the hold on the security assist-
ance, in violation of the law, as the 
Government Accountability Office re-
cently concluded. 
In short, respectfully, the Senate’s 
responsibility to conduct a complete 
and 
fair 
trial 
demands 
that 
Mr. 
Mulvaney testify. 
Second, Mr. Mulvaney’s testimony is 
critical because of his knowledge of the 
planning of President Trump’s abuse of 
power. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, 
the U.S. Ambassador to the European 
Union, testified that there was a quid 
pro quo. Ambassador Sondland is not a 
so-called Never Trumper. Mr. Sondland 
gave $1 million to President Trump’s 
inauguration. 
He testified that everybody was in 
the loop and that it was no secret what 
was going on. In fact, as early as May 
of 2019, Ambassador Sondland made 
clear that he was coordinating on 
Ukraine matters with Mr. Mulvaney. 
Here is what David Holmes, an offi-
cial at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, 
had to say on that matter: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. 
HOLMES. 
While 
Ambassador 
Sondland’s mandate as the accredited Am-
bassador to the European Union did not 
cover individual member states, let alone 
nonmember countries like Ukraine, he made 
clear that he had direct and frequent access 
to President Trump and Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney and portrayed himself as the con-
duit to the President and Mr. Mulvaney for 
this group. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. After the 
U.S. delegation returned from the inau-
guration of the new Ukrainian Presi-
dent in April, they were able to secure 
an Oval Office meeting with President 
Trump to brief him on their trip, in 
part because of Ambassador Sondland’s 
connections to Mick Mulvaney. 
Then, during a June 18, 2019, meeting, 
Ambassador Sondland informed Na-
tional Security Council Senior Direc-
tor Dr. Fiona Hill that he was in 
charge of Ukraine and that he had been 
briefing senior White House officials, 
including Mr. Mulvaney, about his ef-
forts to undertake, as Dr. Hill put it, a 
domestic political errand in Ukraine. 
Here is Dr. Hill explaining this her-
self. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. So I was upset with him that he 
wasn’t fully telling us about all of the meet-
ings that he was having. And he said to me, 
But I’m briefing the President, I’m briefing 
Chief of Staff Mulvaney, I’m briefing Sec-
retary Pompeo, and I talked to Ambassador 
Bolton. Who else do I have to deal with? And 
the point is, we have a robust interagency 
process that deals with Ukraine. It includes 
Mr. Holmes. It includes Ambassador Taylor 
as the charge in Ukraine. It includes a whole 
load of other people. But it struck me when 
yesterday, when you put up on the screen 
Ambassador Sondland’s emails and who was 
on these emails, and he said, These are the 
people who need to know, that he was abso-
lutely right. Because he was being involved 
in a domestic political errand, and we were 
being involved in national security foreign 
policy, and those two things had just di-
verged. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. And there 
is more—much more. A month later, 
President Trump’s National Security 
Advisor at the time, John Bolton, told 
Dr. Fiona Hill to tell the National Se-
curity Council’s lawyers that he was 
not 
part 
of 
whatever 
drug 
deal 
Sondland and Mulvaney were cooking 
up. He made that statement after Am-
bassador Sondland specifically said 
that he had a deal with Mr. Mulvaney 
to schedule a White House visit for 
President Zelensky if Ukraine an-
nounced the two phony investigations 
involving the Bidens and 2016 election 
interference—investigations that were 
sought 
by 
President 
Donald 
John 
Trump. 
Here is Dr. Hill’s testimony about 
Sondland describing this drug deal he 
had with Mulvaney. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. And so when I came in, Gordon 
Sondland was basically saying, well, look, we 
have a deal here that there will be a meet-
ing. I have a deal here with Chief of Staff 
Mulvaney that there will be a meeting if the 
Ukrainians open up or announce these inves-
tigations into 2016 and Burisma. And I cut it 
off immediately there. Because by this point, 
having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over 
again on the television and all of the issues 
that he was asserting, by this point it was 
clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens, 
because Giuliani was laying it out there. I 
could see why Colonel Vindman was alarmed, 
and he said, this is inappropriate, we’re the 
National Security Council, we can’t be in-
volved in this. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The ref-
erenced agreement between Ambas-
sador Sondland and Mick Mulvaney 
was so upsetting that Dr. Hill reported 
it to National Security Council legal 
advisers. Here is the testimony of Dr. 
Hill explaining these particular con-
cerns. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. Yes, but he was—he was making 
a very strong point that he wanted to know 
exactly what was being said. And when I 
came back and related it to him, he had 
some very specific instructions for me. And 
I’m presuming that that’s the question that 
you’re asking. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What was that specific in-
struction? 
Dr. HILL. The specific instruction was 
that I had to go to the lawyers, to John 
Eisenberg, our senior counsel for the Na-
tional Security Council, to basically say,

you tell Eisenberg, Ambassador Bolton told 
me that I am not part of this whatever drug 
deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cook-
ing up. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What did you understand 
him to mean by the drug deal that Mulvaney 
and Sondland were cooking up? 
Dr. HILL. I took it to mean investigations 
for a meeting. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you go speak to the 
lawyers? 
Dr. HILL. I certainly did. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Sondland’s 
testimony not only corroborates Dr. 
Hill’s account. He actually says that 
Mick Mulvaney, the subject of this 
amendment, who should appear before 
the Senate if we are going to have a 
free and fair trial—Sondland says Mick 
Mulvaney knew all about it. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
The CHAIRMAN. What I want to ask you 
about is, he makes reference in that drug 
deal to a drug deal cooked up by you and 
Mulvaney. It’s the reference to Mulvaney 
that I want to ask you about. You’ve testi-
fied that Mulvaney was aware of this quid 
pro quo, of this condition that the Ukrain-
ians had to meet, that is, announcing these 
public investigations to get the White House 
meeting. Is that right? 
Mr. SONDLAND. Yeah. A lot of people 
were aware of it. And— 
The CHAIRMAN. Including Mr. Mulvaney? 
Mr. SONDLAND. Correct. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The docu-
ments also highlight the extensive in-
volvement of Mick Mulvaney in this 
geopolitical shakedown scheme. Email 
messages summarized by Ambassador 
Sondland during his sworn testimony 
show that he informed Mr. Mulvaney, 
as well as Secretary Pompeo and Sec-
retary Perry, of his efforts to persuade 
President Zelensky to announce the in-
vestigations 
desired 
by 
President 
Trump. 
For example, as shown on the screen, 
on 
July 
19, 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
emailed several top administration of-
ficials, including Mr. Mulvaney, stat-
ing that he had talked to President 
Zelensky to help prepare him for a 
phone call with President Trump, and 
he reported that President Zelensky 
planned to assure President Trump 
that he intends to run a fully trans-
parent investigation and will turn over 
every stone. 
Ambassador Sondland made clear in 
his testimony that he was referring to 
the Burisma/Biden and 2016 election in-
terference investigations that were ex-
plicitly mentioned by President Trump 
on the July 25 phone call. 
Mr. Mulvaney wrote in a response: I 
asked NSC to set it up. 
What exactly did Mr. Mulvaney know 
about the Ukrainian commitment to 
turn over every stone? And when did he 
know it? 
These are many of the questions that 
require answers, under oath, from Mr. 
Mulvaney. Mr. Mulvaney is also a cen-
tral figure with respect to how Presi-
dent Trump implemented his pressure 
campaign. 
According to public reports and wit-
ness testimony, Mr. Mulvaney was 
deeply involved with implementing the 
scheme, including the unlawful White 
House freeze on $391 million in aid to 
Ukraine. 
This isn’t just other people fingering 
Mr. Mulvaney. Mr. Mulvaney has him-
self admitted that he was involved. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. MULVANEY. Again, I was involved 
with the process by which the money was 
held up temporarily, okay? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The public 
reports confirm Mr. Mulvaney’s own 
account that he has information that 
goes to the heart of this inquiry, spe-
cifically related to why the President 
ordered the hold on aid to Ukraine and 
kept it in place, despite deep-seated 
concerns among Trump administration 
officials. 
This New York Times article on the 
screen summarizes an email conversa-
tion between Mr. Mulvaney and Robert 
Blair, a senior administration adviser, 
on June 27, when Mr. Mulvaney asked: 
‘‘Did we ever find out about the money 
for Ukraine and whether we can hold it 
back?’’ 
What prompted that email? Accord-
ing to public reports, Mr. Mulvaney 
was on Air Force One—Air Force One— 
with President Trump when he sent it. 
What 
other 
conversations 
did 
Mr. 
Mulvaney have with the President and 
White House officials about this unlaw-
ful freeze? The American people de-
serve to know. 
There is other significant evidence 
concerning Mr. Mulvaney’s role in im-
plementing the scheme. According to 
multiple witnesses, the direction to 
freeze 
the 
security 
assistance 
to 
Ukraine 
was 
delivered 
by 
Mick 
Mulvaney himself. 
Office of Management and Budget of-
ficial Mark Sandy testified about a 
July 12 email from Mr. Will Blair stat-
ing that President Trump ‘‘is directing 
a hold on military support funding for 
Ukraine.’’ 
Was 
Mr. 
Blair 
acting 
at 
Mr. 
Mulvaney’s 
express 
direction? 
The 
Members of this distinguished body de-
serve to know. 
On July 18, the hold was announced 
to the agencies in the administration 
overseeing Ukraine policy matters. 
Those present were blindsided by the 
announcement that the security aid 
appropriated by this Congress on a bi-
partisan basis to Ukraine, which is still 
at war with Russian-backed separatists 
in the east, were alarmed that that aid 
had inexplicably been put on hold. 
Meanwhile, officials at the Defense 
Department and within the Office of 
Management and Budget became in-
creasingly concerned that the hold also 
violated the law. Their concerns turned 
out to be accurate. 
Public reports have indicated that 
the White House is in possession of 
early August emails, exchanges be-
tween Acting Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney and White House budget offi-
cials seeking to provide an explanation 
for the funds—an explanation, I should 
note, that they were trying to provide 
after the President had already ordered 
the hold. 
Mr. Mulvaney presumably has an-
swers to these questions. We don’t 
know what those answers are, but he 
should provide them to this Senate and 
to the American people. 
Finally, on October 17, 2019, at a 
press briefing at the White House, Mr. 
Mulvaney left no doubt that President 
Trump withheld the essential military 
aid as leverage to try to extract phony 
political investigations as part of his 
effort to solicit foreign interference in 
the 2020 election. 
This was an extraordinary press con-
ference. Mr. Mulvaney made clear that 
the President was, in fact, pressuring 
Ukraine to investigate the conspiracy 
theory that Ukraine, rather than Rus-
sia, had interfered in the 2016 elec-
tion—a conspiracy theory promoted by 
none other than the great purveyor of 
democracy, Vladimir Putin himself. 
When White House reporters at-
tempted to clarify this acknowledge-
ment of a quid pro quo related to secu-
rity assistance, Mr. Mulvaney replied, 
‘‘We do that all the time with foreign 
policy. I have news for everybody: get 
over it.’’ 
Let’s listen to a portion of that stun-
ning exchange. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Answer. Did he also mention to me in the 
past that the corruption related to the DNC 
server, absolutely. No question about that. 
But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the 
money. Now there was a report— 
Question. So the demand for an investiga-
tion into the Democrats was part of the rea-
son that he wanted to withhold funding to 
Ukraine. 
Answer. The look back to what happened 
in 2016— 
Question. The investigation into Demo-
crats— 
Answer.—certainly was part of the thing 
he was worried about in corruption with that 
nation. That is absolutely appropriate. 
Question. But to be clear, what you just 
described is a quid pro quo. It is: Funding 
will not flow unless the investigation into 
the Democratic server happens as well. 
Answer. We do that all the time with for-
eign policy. We were holding money at the 
same time for—what was it? The Northern 
Triangle countries. We were holding up aid 
at the Northern Tribal countries so that 
they would change their policies on immi-
gration. By the way—and this speaks to an 
important point—I’m sorry? This speaks to 
an important point, because I heard this yes-
terday and I can never remember the gen-
tleman who testified. Was it McKinney, the 
guy—was that his name? I don’t know him. 
He testified yesterday. And if you go—and if 
you believe the news reports—okay? Because 
we’ve not seen any transcripts of this. The 
only transcript I’ve seen was Sondland’s tes-
timony this morning. If you read the news 
reports and you believe them—what did 
McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney 
said yesterday that he was really upset with 
the political influence in foreign policy. 
That was one of the reasons he was so upset 
about this. And I have news for everybody: 
Get over it. There’s going to be political in-
fluence in foreign policy. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In this ex-
traordinary 
press 
conference, 
Mr. 
Mulvaney spoke with authority and 
conviction about why President Trump 
withheld the aid. He did not mince his 
words. But then following the press

January 21, 2020 
conference, he tried to walk back his 
statements, as if he had not said them, 
or had not meant them. We need to 
hear from Mick Mulvaney directly so 
he can clarify his true intentions. 
Having gone through the need for the 
evidence, 
let’s 
briefly 
address 
the 
President’s arguments that he can 
block this testimony. That argument is 
not only wrong, it fundamentally un-
dermines our system of checks and bal-
ances. 
Step back for a moment and consider 
the extraordinary position that Presi-
dent Trump is trying to manufacture 
for himself. 
The Department of Justice has al-
ready said that the President cannot be 
indicted or prosecuted in office. As we 
sit here today, the President has actu-
ally filed a brief in the Supreme Court 
saying he cannot be criminally inves-
tigated while in the White House. 
The Senate and the House are the 
only check that is left when the Presi-
dent abuses his power, tries to cheat in 
the next election, undermines our na-
tional security, breaks the law in doing 
so, and then tries to cover it up. This is 
America. No one is above the law. 
But if the President is allowed to de-
termine whether he is even inves-
tigated by Congress, if he is allowed to 
decide whether he should comply with 
lawful subpoenas in connection with an 
impeachment inquiry or trial, then he 
is the ultimate arbiter of whether he 
did 
anything 
wrong. 
That 
cannot 
stand. 
If he can’t be indicted, and he can’t 
be impeached, and he can’t be removed, 
then he can’t be held accountable. That 
is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitu-
tion. 
You will no doubt hear that the rea-
son the President blocked all of these 
witnesses, including Mr. Mulvaney, 
from testifying is because of some lofty 
concern for the Office of the Presi-
dency and the preservation of execu-
tive privilege. 
Let’s get real. How can blocking wit-
nesses from telling the truth about the 
President’s misconduct help preserve 
the Office of the Presidency? This type 
of blanket obstruction undermines the 
credibility of the Office of the Presi-
dency and deals the Constitution a po-
tentially mortal death blow. 
To be clear, executive privilege does 
not provide a legally justifiable basis 
for his complete and total blockage of 
evidence. In fact, as you heard earlier 
today, President Trump never even in-
voked executive privilege—not once. 
And without ever asserting this privi-
lege, how can you consider his argu-
ment in a serious fashion? 
Instead, 
speaking 
through 
Mr. 
Cipollone, 
the 
distinguished 
White 
House Counsel, in a letter dated Octo-
ber 8, 2019, President Trump simply de-
cided that he did not want to partici-
pate in the investigation into his own 
wrongdoing. 
It was a categorical decision not to 
cooperate, without consideration of 
specific facts or legal arguments. In 
fact, even the words President Trump 
used through his White House Counsel 
were made up. 
In the letter, Mr. Cipollone referred 
to so-called ‘‘executive branch con-
fidentiality interests.’’ But that is not 
a recognized jurisprudential shield, not 
a proper assertion of executive privi-
lege. To the extent that there are privi-
lege issues to consider, those can be re-
solved during their testimony, as they 
have been for decades. 
And finally, the President claimed 
that Mr. Mulvaney could not be com-
pelled to testify because of so-called 
absolute immunity. But every court to 
address this legal fiction has rejected 
it. 
As the Supreme Court emphatically 
stated, in unanimous fashion, in its de-
cision on the Nixon tapes, confiden-
tiality interests of the President must 
yield to an impeachment inquiry when 
there is a legitimate need for the infor-
mation, as there is here today. 
There can be no doubt that Mr. 
Mulvaney, as the President’s Chief of 
Staff and head of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, is uniquely situated 
to provide this distinguished body with 
relevant and important information 
about the charges in the Articles of Im-
peachment. 
The President’s obstruction has no 
basis in law and should yield to this 
body’s coequal authority to investigate 
impeachable and corrupt conduct. 
One final point bears mentioning. If 
the President wanted to make wit-
nesses available, even while preserving 
the limited protections of executive 
privilege, he can do so. In fact, Presi-
dent Trump expressed his desire for 
witnesses to testify in the Senate just 
last month. 
Let’s go to the videotape. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. So, when it’s fair, and 
it will be fair in the Senate, I would love to 
have Mike Pompeo, I’d love to have Mick, I’d 
love to have Rick Perry and many other peo-
ple testify. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. If President 
Trump had nothing to hide, as he and 
his advisers repeatedly claim, they 
should all simply testify in the Senate 
trial. What is President Donald John 
Trump hiding from the American peo-
ple? 
The Constitution requires a fair trial. 
Our democracy needs a fair trial. 
The American people deserve a fair 
trial. A fair trial means witnesses. A 
fair trial means documents. A fair trial 
means a consideration of all of the 
available evidence. A fair trial means 
testimony from Mick Mulvaney. 
Mr. Chief Justice, the House man-
agers reserve the balance of our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you. 
Mr. Mike Purpura from the White 
House Counsel’s Office, Deputy Counsel 
to the President, will give the argu-
ment. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, good 
evening. My name is Michael Purpura. 
I serve as Deputy Counsel to the Presi-
dent. 
We strongly oppose the amendments 
and support the resolution. There is 
simply no need to alter the process on 
witnesses and documents from that of 
the Clinton trial, which was supported 
by this body 100 to 0. 
At its core, this case is very simple, 
and the key facts are undisputed. 
First, you have seen the transcripts 
which the President released—trans-
parent and unprecedented. There was 
no quid pro quo for anything. Security 
assistance funds aren’t even mentioned 
on the call. 
Second, President Zelensky and the 
highest ranking officials in the Ukrain-
ian Government repeatedly have said 
there was no quid pro quo and there 
was no pressure. 
Third, the Ukrainians were not even 
aware of the pause in the aid at the 
time of the call and weren’t aware of 
it—they did not become aware of it 
until more than a month later. 
Fourth, the only witnesses in the 
House record who actually spoke to the 
President about the aid—Ambassador 
Sondland and Senator RON JOHNSON— 
say the President was unequivocal in 
saying there was no quid pro quo. 
Fifth, and this one is pretty obvious, 
the aid flowed and President Trump 
and President Zelensky met without 
any 
investigations 
started 
or 
an-
nounced. 
Finally—and I ask that you not lose 
sight of the big picture here—by pro-
viding legal aid to Ukraine, President 
Trump has proven himself to be a bet-
ter friend and ally to Ukraine than his 
predecessor. 
The time for the House managers to 
bring their case is now. They had their 
chance to develop their evidence before 
they sent the Articles of Impeachment 
to this Chamber. This Chamber’s role 
is not to do the House’s job for it. 
I yield the balance of my time to Mr. 
Cipollone. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
Just a couple of observations. First 
of all, as Mr. Purpura said, what we are 
talking about is when this question is 
addressed. Under the resolution, that 
will be next week. This resolution was 
accepted 100 to 0. Some of you were 
here then and thought it was great. If 
we keep going like this, it will be next 
week. For those of you keeping score 
at home, they haven’t even started yet. 
We are here today. We came hoping 
to have a trial. They spent the entire 
day telling you and the American peo-
ple that they can’t prove their case. I 
could have told you that in 5 minutes 
and saved us all a lot of time. 
They came here talking about the 
GAO. It is an organization that works 
for Congress. Do you know who dis-
agrees with the GAO? Don’t take it 
from me; they do. They sent you Arti-
cles of Impeachment that make no 
claim of any violation of any law. 
By the way, you can search high and 
low in the Articles of Impeachment,

and you know what it doesn’t say? It 
doesn’t say ‘‘quid pro quo’’ because 
there wasn’t any. Only in Washington 
would someone say that it is wrong 
when you don’t spend taxpayer dollars 
fast enough even if you spend them on 
time. 
Let’s talk about the Judiciary Com-
mittee for a second. They spent 2 days 
in the Judiciary Committee—2 days. 
The Judiciary Committee is supposed 
to be in charge of impeachments. The 
delivery time for the articles they have 
produced was 33 days. I think this 
might be the first impeachment in his-
tory where the delivery time was 
longer than the investigation in the 
Judiciary Committee. 
They come here and falsely accuse 
people—by the way, they falsely ac-
cused you. You are on trial now. They 
falsely accused people of phony polit-
ical investigations. Really. Since the 
House Democrats took over, that is all 
we have had from them. They have 
used their office and all the money 
that the taxpayers send to Washington 
to pay them to conduct phony political 
investigations against the President, 
against his family, against anyone who 
knew him. They started impeaching 
him the minute he was elected. They 
weaponized the House of Representa-
tives to investigate incessantly their 
political opponent. And they come here 
and make false allegations of phony 
political investigations. I think the 
doctors call that projection. It is time 
for it to end. It is time for someone— 
for the Senate to hold them account-
able. 
Think about what they are asking. I 
said it; they didn’t deny it. They are 
trying to remove President Trump’s 
name from the ballot, and they can’t 
prove their case. They have told you 
that all day long. Think about what 
they are asking some of you Senators 
to do. Some of you are running for 
President. They are asking you to use 
your office to remove your political op-
ponent from the ballot. That is wrong. 
That is not in the interest of our coun-
try. And to be honest with you, it is 
not really a show of confidence. 
I suppose we will have this debate 
again next week if we ever get there. It 
is getting late. I would ask you, re-
spectfully, if we could simply start— 
maybe tomorrow we can start, and 
they can make their argument, and 
they can, I guess, make a case that 
they once called ‘‘overwhelming.’’ We 
will see. 
But this resolution is right, it is fair, 
and it makes sense. You have a right to 
hear what they have to say before you 
have to decide these critical issues. 
That is all this is about. Is it now or is 
it a week from now? Seriously, can we 
please start? 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, 
is your side complete? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Yes, we 
are, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The House managers have 14 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Counsel to 
the President indicated that we have 
not charged President Trump with a 
crime. We have charged him with 
crimes against the U.S. Constitution— 
high crimes and misdemeanors and 
abuse of power. It strikes at the very 
heart of what the Framers of the Con-
stitution were concerned about—be-
trayal of one’s oath of office for per-
sonal gain and the corruption of our 
democracy. 
High 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors are what this trial is all 
about. 
Counsel for the President again has 
declined to address the substantive 
merits of the amendment that has been 
offered and tried to suggest that House 
Democrats have only been focused on 
trying to oust President Trump. Noth-
ing could be further from the truth. 
In the last year, we passed 400 bills 
and sent them to this Chamber, and 275 
of those bills are bipartisan in nature, 
addressing 
issues 
like 
lowering 
healthcare costs and prescription drug 
prices, trying to deal with the gun vio-
lence epidemic. We have worked with 
President Trump on criminal justice 
reform. I personally worked with him, 
along with all of you, on the First Step 
Act. We worked with him on the U.S.- 
Mexico-Canada trade agreement. We 
worked with him to fund the govern-
ment. We don’t hate this President, but 
we love the Constitution. We love 
America. We love our democracy. That 
is why we are here today. 
The question was asked by Mr. 
Sekulow as he opened before this dis-
tinguished body: Why? Why are we 
here? 
Let me see if I can just posit an an-
swer to that question. We are here, sir, 
because President Trump pressured a 
foreign government to target an Amer-
ican citizen for political and personal 
gain. We are here, sir, because Presi-
dent Trump solicited foreign inter-
ference in the 2020 election and cor-
rupted our democracy. We are here, sir, 
because President Trump withheld $391 
million in military aid from a vulner-
able Ukraine without justification in a 
manner that has been deemed unlaw-
ful. We are here, sir, because President 
Donald Trump elevated his personal 
political interests and subordinated the 
national 
security 
interests 
of 
the 
United States of America. We are here, 
sir, because President Trump corruptly 
abused his power, and then he tried to 
cover it up. And we are here, sir, to fol-
low the facts, apply the law, be guided 
by the Constitution, and present the 
truth to the American people. That is 
why we are here, Mr. Sekulow. And if 
you don’t know, now you know. 
I yield to my distinguished colleague, 
Chairman SCHIFF. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I thank the 
gentleman for yielding and just want 
to provide a couple of quick fact 
checks to my colleagues at the other 
table. 
First, Mr. Purpura said that security 
assistance funds were not mentioned at 
all in the July 25 call between Presi-
dent Trump and President Zelensky. 
Let’s think back to what was discussed 
in that call. You might remember from 
that 
call 
that 
President 
Zelensky 
thanks President Trump for the Jav-
elin anti-tank weapons and says they 
are ready to order some more. 
And what is President Trump’s im-
mediate response? 
I have a favor to ask, though. 
What was it about the President of 
Ukraine’s bringing up military assist-
ance that triggered the President to go 
immediately to the favor that he want-
ed? I think that it is telling that it 
takes place in that part of the con-
versation. 
So, yes, security assistance, military 
assistance did come up in that call. It 
came up immediately preceding the 
ask. What kind of message do you 
think that sends to Ukraine? They are 
not stupid. The people watching this 
aren’t stupid. 
Now, Mr. Purpura said: Well, they 
never found out about it—or they 
didn’t find out about the freeze of the 
aid until a month later. Mr. Purpura 
needs to be a little more careful with 
his facts. Let me tell you about some 
of the testimony you are going to hear, 
and you will only hear it because it 
took place in the House. These were 
other 
witnesses 
from 
whom 
you 
wouldn’t be able to hear it. 
You had Catherine Croft, a witness 
from the State Department, a career 
official at the State Department, who 
talked about how quickly, actually, 
after the freeze went into place that 
the Ukrainians found out about it, and 
she started getting contacts from the 
Ukrainian Embassy here in Wash-
ington. She said she was really im-
pressed with her diplomatic tradecraft. 
What does that mean? It means she 
was really impressed with how quickly 
the Ukrainians found out about some-
thing that the administration was try-
ing to hide from the American people. 
Ukraine found out about it. In fact, 
Laura Cooper, a career official at the 
Defense Department, said that her of-
fice started getting inquiries from 
Ukraine about the issues with the aid 
on July 25—the very day of the call. So 
much for Ukraine’s not finding out 
about this until a month later. 
I thought this was very telling, too: 
The New York Times disclosed that by 
July 30—so within a week of the call 
between President Trump and Presi-
dent Zelensky—Ukraine’s Foreign Min-
istry received a diplomatic cable from 
its Embassy, indicating that Trump 
had frozen the military aid. Within a 
week, that cable is reported to have 
gone from the Ukrainian Embassy to 
the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. 
Former Ukrainian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Olena Zerkal said: 
We had this information. It was definitely 
mentioned that there were some issues. 
She went on to say that the cable 
was simultaneously provided to Presi-
dent 
Zelensky’s 
office, 
but

Derkach, whom you will hear more 
about later—a top aide to President

Zelensky—reportedly directed her to 
keep silent and not discuss the hold 
with reporters or Congress. 
Now, we heard testimony about why 
the Ukrainians wanted to keep it se-
cret that they knew about the hold. 
You can imagine why Zelensky didn’t 
want his own people to know that the 
President of the United States was 
holding back aid from him. What does 
that look like for a new President of 
Ukraine who is trying to make the case 
that he is going to be able to defend his 
own country because he has such a 
great relationship with the great pa-
tron, the United States? He didn’t want 
the Ukrainians to know about it. But 
do you know? Even more than that, he 
didn’t want the Russians to know 
about it for the reasons we talked 
about earlier. So, yes, the Ukrainians 
kept it close to the vest. 
Mr. Purpura also went on to say: 
Well, the Ukrainians say they don’t 
feel any pressure. 
That is what they say now. Of course, 
we know that it is not true. 
We have had testimony that they 
didn’t want to be used as a political 
pawn in U.S. domestic politics. They 
resisted it. You will hear more testi-
mony about that, about the efforts to 
push back on this public statement— 
how they tried to water it down and 
how they tried to leave out the spe-
cifics of how Giuliani, at the Presi-
dent’s behest, forced them: You know, 
no, this isn’t going to be credible if you 
don’t add in Burisma and if you don’t 
add in 2016. 
You will hear about the pressure. 
They felt it. So why isn’t President 
Zelensky now saying he was pressured? 
Well, can you imagine the impact of 
that? Can you imagine the impact if 
President Zelensky were to acknowl-
edge today: Hell, yes, we felt pressured. 
You would, too. We are at war with 
Russia for crying out loud. Yes, we felt 
pressured. We needed those hundreds of 
millions in military aid. Do you think 
I am going to say that now? I still 
can’t get in the White House door. 
They let Lavrov in, the Russian For-
eign Minister. They let him in, but I 
can’t even get in the White House door. 
Do you think I am going to go out now 
and admit to this scheme? 
I mean, anyone who has watched this 
President in the last 3 years knows how 
vindictive he can be. Do you think it 
would be smart for the President of 
Ukraine to contradict the President of 
the United States so directly on an 
issue he is being impeached for? That 
would be the worst form of malpractice 
for the new President of Ukraine. We 
shouldn’t be surprised he would deny 
it. We should be surprised if he were to 
admit it. 
Let me just end with a couple of ob-
servations about Mr. Cipollone’s com-
ments. 
He says: This is no big deal. We are 
not talking about when we are going to 
have witnesses—or if we are going to 
have witnesses. We are just talking 
about when. We are just talking about 
when, as if, well, later, they are going 
to say: Oh, yes, well, we are happy to 
have the witnesses now. It is just a 
question of when. 
OK. As my colleague said, let’s be 
real. There will be no ‘‘when.’’ Do you 
think they are going to have an epiph-
any a few days from now and say: OK, 
we are ready for witnesses? No. No, 
their goal is to get you to say no now, 
to get you to have the trial, and then 
argue to ‘‘make it go away.’’ Let’s dis-
miss the whole thing. 
That is the plan. A vote to delay is a 
vote to deny. Let’s make no mistake 
about that. They are not going to have 
an epiphany a few days from now and 
suddenly say: OK, the American people 
do deserve the answers. Their whole 
goal is that you will never get to that 
point. You will never get to that point. 
When they say when, they mean never. 
I yield back.

The motion to table is agreed to; the

The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent to ask the 
Democratic leader, as there are certain 
similarities to all of these amend-
ments, whether he might be willing to 
enter into a unanimous consent agree-
ment to stack these votes. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, it is so ordered. 
The inquiry is permitted. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. 
The bottom line is very simple. 
As has been clear to every Senator 
and the country, we believe witnesses 
and documents are extremely impor-
tant and that a compelling case has 
been made for them. We will have votes 
on all of those. 
Also, the leader, without consulting 
us, made a number of significant 
changes that significantly deviated 
from the 1999 Clinton resolution. We 
want to change those, so there will be 
a good number of votes. We are willing 
to do some of those votes tomorrow. 
There is no reason we have to do them 
all tonight and inconvenience the Sen-
ate and the Chief Justice, but we will 
not back off on getting votes on all of 
these amendments, which we regard as 
extremely significant and important to 
the country. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
as I have said repeatedly, all of these 
amendments 
under 
the 
resolution 
could be dealt with at the appropriate 
time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Demo-
cratic leader is recognized. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1288 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send an amendment to the desk to sub-
poena certain documents and records 
from the Department of Defense, and I 
ask that it be read. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
read the document. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHUMER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1288. 
At the appropriate place in the resolving 
clause, insert the following:

(2) the Sergeant at Arms is authorized to

The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amend-
ment is arguable by the parties for 2 
hours. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF, are you a pro-
ponent or opponent? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We are a pro-
ponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, we are an opponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
the House managers can proceed first 
and reserve their time for rebuttal. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, the House managers will be re-
serving the balance of our time to re-
spond to the argument of the counsel 
for the President. 
Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel 
for the President, and the American 
people, I would like to begin by getting 
something off of my chest, something 
that has been bothering me for a little 
while. 
Counsel for the President and some 
other folks in this room have been 
talking a lot about how late it is get-
ting, how long this debate is taking. It 
is almost 10 p.m. in Washington, DC. 
They say: Let’s get the show on the 
road. Let’s get moving. 
The whole time, the only thing I can 
think about is how late it is in other 
places because right now, it is the mid-
dle of the night in Europe, where we 
have over 60,000 U.S. troops. There are 
helicopter pilots flying training mis-
sions, 
tankers 
maneuvering 
across 
fields, infantrymen walking with 100- 
pound packs, and, yes, Ukrainian sol-
diers getting ready to wake up in their 
trenches facing off against Russian 
tanks rights now. I don’t think any of 
those folks want to hear us talk about 
how tired we are or how late it is. We 
have time to have this debate. 
That is why the House managers 
strongly support this amendment to 
subpoena key documents from the De-
partment of Defense, because just like 
the subpoena for OMB, these docu-
ments from DOD speak directly to one 
of President Trump’s abuses—his with-
holding of critical military aid from 
our partner Ukraine to further his per-
sonal political campaign. 
In fact, $250 million of taxpayer-fund-
ed military aid for Ukraine was man-
aged by the Department of Defense as 
part of the Ukraine Security Assist-
ance Initiative. These funds, approved 
by 87 Senators in this very room, would 
purchase additional training, equip-
ment, and advising to strengthen the 
capacity of Ukraine’s Armed Forces. 
The equipment approved for Ukraine 
included sniper rifles, rocket-propelled 
grenade 
launchers, 
counter-artillery 
radar, night vision goggles, and med-
ical supplies. This equipment was to be 
purchased 
almost 
exclusively 
from 
American businesses. This equipment, 
along with the training and advising 
provided by DOD, was intended to pro-
tect our national security by helping 
our friend Ukraine fight against Vladi-
mir Putin’s Russia. 
Earlier, counsel for the President 
tried to make the argument: Well, it 
made it there. The aid eventually made 
it there. The delay doesn’t really mat-
ter. 
You heard me talk about why the 
delay does matter, but what counsel 
for the President didn’t say is that all 
of their aid has not made it there. Con-
gress had to pass another law so that 
$35.2 million of that aid wouldn’t expire 
and lapse. We did, but to this day, $18.5 
million of that money remains out-
standing and hasn’t made its way to 
the battlefield. 
It was DOD that repeatedly advised 
the White House and OMB of the im-
portance of security assistance not 
only to Ukraine but also U.S. national 
security. It was DOD in August of 2019 
that warned OMB that the freeze was 
unlawful and that the funds could be 
lost as a result. It was DOD that 
scrambled, after the hold was lifted 
without explanation on September 11, 
to spend the funds before they expired 
at the end of the month. 
Without a doubt, DOD has key docu-
ments that the President has refused 
to turn over to Congress—key docu-
ments that go to the heart of the ways 
in which the President abused his 
power. It is time to subpoena those 
documents. 
DOD documents would provide in-
sight into critical aspects of this hold. 
They would show the decisionmaking 
process and motivations behind Presi-
dent Trump’s freeze. They would reveal 
the concerns expressed by DOD and 
OMB officials that the hold was vio-
lating the law. They would reveal our 
defense officials’ grave concerns about 
the impact of the freeze on Ukraine 
and U.S. national security. They would 
show that senior Defense Department 
officials repeatedly attempted to con-
vince President Trump to release the 
aid. In short, they would further estab-
lish the President’s scheme to use our 
national defense funds to benefit his 
personal political campaign. 
We are not speculating about the ex-
istence of these documents, and we are 
not guessing about what they might 
show because during the course of the 
investigation in the House, witnesses 
who testified before the committees 
identified multiple documents directly 
relevant to the impeachment inquiry 
that DOD continues to withhold. We 
know these documents exist, and we 
know that the only reason we do not 
have them is because the President 
himself directed the Pentagon not to 
produce them because he knows what 
they would show. 
To demonstrate the significance of 
the DOD documents and the value they 
would provide in this trial, I would like 
to walk you through some of what we 
know exists but that the Trump admin-
istration continues to refuse to turn 
over. Again, based on what is known 
from the testimony and the few docu-
ments that have been obtained from 
public reporting and lawsuits, it is 
clear that the President is trying to 
hide this evidence because he is afraid 
of what it would show the American 
people. 
We know that DOD has documents 
that reveal that as early as June, the 
President was considering withholding 
military aid for Ukraine. As I men-
tioned earlier, the President began

January 21, 2020 
questioning military aid to Ukraine in 
June of last year. The President’s ques-
tions came days after DOD issued a 
press release on June 18 announcing it 
would provide its $250 million portion 
of the aid to Ukraine. 
According to public reporting, Dep-
uty Under Secretary of Defense Elaine 
McCusker, who manages the DOD’s 
budget, learned about the President’s 
questions. We know this email exists 
because in response to a Freedom of In-
formation Act lawsuit, the Trump ad-
ministration was forced to release a re-
dacted email. But DOD provided none 
of those documents to the House. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of De-
fense Laura Cooper and her team were 
tasked by the Secretary of Defense 
with responding to the President’s 
questions about Ukraine assistance. 
Ms. Cooper testified that she put those 
answers in an email and described 
those emails during her deposition. She 
testified that DOD advised that the se-
curity assistance was crucial for both 
Ukraine and U.S. national security and 
had strong bipartisan support in Con-
gress. But DOD provided none of those 
documents to the House. 
With this proposed amendment, the 
Senate has an opportunity to obtain 
and review the full record that can fur-
ther demonstrate how and why the 
President was holding the aid. 
Laura Cooper also testified about the 
interagency meetings that occurred in 
late 2019—the meetings at which DOD 
was shocked to learn that President 
Trump had placed a mysterious hold on 
the security assistance. We know what 
happened at several of those meetings 
because Ms. Cooper participated in 
them, in some cases with other senior 
Defense Department officials. However, 
we don’t have Laura Cooper’s notes 
from those meetings. We don’t have the 
emails she sent to senior DOD officials 
reporting the stunning news about the 
President’s hold. We don’t have the 
emails that show the response from the 
Secretary of Defense and other senior 
defense officials because DOD has re-
fused to provide them. 
Separately, Laura Cooper testified 
about when the Ukraine first learned of 
the President’s secret hold on the mili-
tary assistance. The same day as the 
President’s July 25 call with President 
Zelensky, DOD officials received two 
emails from the State Department in-
dicating that officials from the Ukrain-
ian Embassy and congressional staff 
had become aware of the hold and were 
starting to ask questions. 
Ms. Cooper testified that she was in-
formed that ‘‘the Ukrainian embassy 
and House Foreign Affairs Committee 
are asking about the military aid’’ and 
that ‘‘The Hill’’ knows about the FMS 
situation to an extent, and so does the 
Ukrainian Embassy. All of this shows 
that people were starting to get very 
worried. 
Again, this amendment for a sub-
poena to DOD would compel the pro-
duction of these important documents, 
but, again, there is more. DOD docu-
ments would also reveal key facts 
about what happened on July 25 after 
OMB directed DOD to ‘‘hold off’’ on 
any additional DOD obligations for the 
assistance to Ukraine. How did DOD of-
ficials react to OMB’s directive to keep 
this order quiet? Did DOD officials 
raise immediate concerns about the le-
gality of the hold—concerns that they 
would eventually vocally articulate to 
OMB in August? Did DOD officials hear 
from the American businesses that 
were on tap to provide the equipment 
for Ukraine? Was DOD informed that 
the President’s hold would undermine 
American jobs? Answers to those ques-
tions may be found in DOD emails— 
emails that we can all see if you issue 
the subpoena. 
Earlier, I mentioned that by late 
July, officials in our government had 
raised significant concerns about the 
impact and the legality of President’s 
Trump’s hold on the military aid. We 
know this from witness testimony, 
public reporting, and documents pro-
duced in the Freedom of Information 
Act lawsuits. For example, at an inter-
agency meeting on July 31, Laura Coo-
per, one of the officials at DOD, an-
nounced that because there were two 
legally available options to continue 
the hold and they did not have direc-
tion to pursue either of those legal op-
tions, DOD would have to start spend-
ing the funds on August 6. Cooper ex-
plained that if they did not start 
spending the funds, they would risk 
violating the Impoundment Control 
Act. It was a fateful warning because 
that is exactly what happened. 
Throughout August, Pentagon offi-
cials grew increasingly concerned as 
the hold dragged on. According to pub-
lic reporting, DOD wrote to OMB on 
August 9 to say that it could no longer 
claim the delay would have no effect on 
the Defense Department’s ability to 
spend the funds. We only know this 
through recent reporting about the 
contents of the email. 
President Trump certainly hasn’t 
made this information public. In re-
sponse to a Freedom of Information 
Act request, the Trump administration 
released this August 9 email from 
Elaine McCusker, the Pentagon’s chief 
budget officer. As you can see from the 
slide in front of you, it is almost en-
tirely blacked out. 
According to public reporting, the 
email said: 
As we discussed, as of 12 AUG, we don’t 
think we can agree that the pause ‘‘will not 
preclude timely execution.’’ We hope it won’t 
and will do all we can to execute once the 
policy decision is made, but can no longer 
make that declarative statement. 
Let me interpret what is actually 
being said here. What is actually being 
said is: We are in trouble. We can’t 
spend the money in the time that we 
have left, and we are not going to cover 
your tracks anymore and say that we 
can. The extensive redactions in the 
Freedom of Information Act produc-
tions highlight the administration’s ef-
forts to conceal the President’s wrong-
doing. They also underscore why the 
Senate must subpoena DOD documents 
to ensure that all of the relevant facts 
come to light, and, yes, there is more. 
Based on the concerns expressed by 
McCusker and others at DOD, OMB 
eventually dropped from the docu-
ments the statement that the hold 
would not preclude timely execution of 
the funds. But OMB also circulated 
talking points claiming: ‘‘No action 
has been taken by OMB that would pre-
clude the obligation of these funds be-
fore the end of the fiscal year.’’ 
Let me just explain what is going on 
here. Everybody is getting worried. Ev-
erybody knows that something bad is 
about to happen. Nobody has a good ex-
planation, and nobody wants to be left 
holding the bag. So they are sending 
the emails, and they are sending the 
memos to say: I told you so, and I am 
not going to be held responsible. 
DOD’s McCusker took issue with 
OMB’s talking point. She did so in 
writing. Ms. McCusker emailed Mr. 
Duffey to tell him that OMB’s talking 
points were ‘‘just not accurate’’ and 
that DOD had been consistently con-
veying that point for weeks. Again, we 
know this from a press report—not 
from documents produced to Congress 
by the Trump administration. 
Now, President Trump did release 
some documents in response to a law-
suit under the Freedom of Information 
Act, but here is what Ms. McCusker’s 
email looked like when it was released 
by the Trump administration. 
Her concern that OMB’s talking 
point was ‘‘just not accurate’’ was, 
again, entirely blacked out. What else 
is being hidden from the American peo-
ple? The Senate should issue the sub-
poena. 
DOD documents would also shed light 
on OMB’s actions as the President’s 
scheme unraveled. On September 9, Ms. 
McCusker informed Duffey that DOD 
could fall short of spending $120 million 
or more because of the hold. Duffey re-
sponded by suggesting that it would be 
DOD’s fault if they ended up violating 
the Impoundment Control Act. 
McCusker responded: ‘‘You can’t be 
serious. I am speechless.’’ 
It will come as no surprise, then, 
that the administration entirely re-
dacted this email, too, when it pro-
duced the documents in connection 
with the Freedom of Information Act 
lawsuit. Thanks to public reporting, 
though, we do know its contents, but 
what else is being hidden from the 
American people? What other reactions 
did this exchange set off within DOD? 
And were those concerns brought back 
to the White House? 
The Department of Defense’s docu-
ments would shed light on these ques-
tions. The American people deserve an-
swers. 
Make no mistake, the record before 
the House fully supports the conclusion 
that President Trump froze vital mili-
tary aid to pressure Ukraine into help-
ing the President’s political campaign. 
The DOD documents would provide fur-
ther evidence of this scheme. They

would expose the full extent of the 
truth to Congress and the American 
people and would firmly rebut any no-
tion that President Trump was acting 
based on concerns about corruption or 
other countries’ contributions, and the 
President knows it. If there was any 
doubt, recent events prove that DOD 
has documents that are directly rel-
evant to this trial. 
As I spoke about earlier, before I was 
a Member of Congress, I was a soldier 
in Iraq and Afghanistan. I do know 
what it feels like to not have the equip-
ment that you need. The men and 
women who work at the Department of 
Defense and administer this vital aid 
understand that reality too. That is 
why they repeatedly made the case to 
President Trump that military assist-
ance to Ukraine is important and that 
it would not only help Ukraine but also 
bolster our deterrence against further 
Russian aggression in Europe. Every 
time we have these discussions, that 
might seem abstract to people around 
the country. I do think about those 
60,000 U.S. troops we have in Europe, 
many of whom, by the way, are sta-
tioned there with their families, their 
spouses, their children, and how they 
are training and working every day to 
hold the line and fight for freedom and 
liberty in Europe. And if the war in 
Ukraine spills over outside of Ukraine, 
it is those men and women who will 
have to get into their tanks and their 
helicopters and do their job. 
The United States Senate cannot let 
this information remain hidden. It goes 
directly to one of President Trump’s 
abuses of power—again, withholding 
aid that 87 people in this room already 
voted for. The President, the Senate, 
and the American people deserve a fair 
trial. Let’s see the documents and let’s 
see them now and let the facts speak 
for themselves. 
I would like to end by reading a short 
transcript, something that I was think-
ing about earlier this evening. This is a 
transcript from Ambassador Taylor’s 
testimony. I just want to take a 
minute to read it to you. He was talk-
ing about a trip that he made to visit 
our friends in Ukraine. 
We had a meeting with the defense min-
ister. It was the first meeting of the day. We 
went over there. They invited us to a cere-
mony that they have in front of their min-
istry every day. Every day they have this 
ceremony, and it is about a half-an-hour 
ceremony where soldiers are in formation, 
the defense minister, and families of soldiers 
who have been killed are all there. The selec-
tion of which soldiers who have been killed 
are honored is on the date of it. 
So whatever today’s date is, you 
know if we were there today, on the 
22nd of October, the families of those 
soldiers who were killed on any 22nd of 
October in the previous 5 years would 
be there. 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
was 
talking 
about our friends. At least 13,000 of 
them have given their lives in the last 
5 years in the fight for liberty in Eu-
rope. This, ladies and gentleman, is a 
national disgrace, and only the people 
in this room can fix it. It is time to 
issue the subpoenas. 
Mr. Chief Justice, the House man-
agers reserve the balance of our time 
for an opportunity to respond to the 
President’s argument. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Mr. Philbin will address the 
argument. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Philbin. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, I will be 
brief. This may seem like some deja vu 
all over again because we have been ar-
guing about the same issues, really, 
over and over and over for a long time. 
I think something that Americans 
don’t really understand about Wash-
ington is how could the House Demo-
crats think that it is the best use of 
time for this body to spend an entire 
day deciding simply the issue of when 
this body should decide about whether 
or not there should be witnesses and 
documents subpoenaed? That is the 
issue before the body now. It is not the 
question, finally, of whether there 
should be witnesses or documents. 
As the majority leader has made 
clear multiple times, the underlying 
resolution simply allows that issue to 
be addressed a week from now. The 
only question at issue now—and the 
House managers keep saying: How can 
you have a trial without witnesses? 
How can you have a trial without docu-
ments? That is not even the issue. The 
only issue now is whether you have to 
decide that issue to subpoena docu-
ments or witnesses now or decide it in 
a week after you hear the presen-
tations. Why are they so eager to have 
you buy a pig in a poke? Why is it nec-
essary to make that decision without 
having more information? 
In the Clinton trial, this body agreed 
100 to 0 that it made more sense to 
have more information and then decide 
how to proceed and that it was rational 
to have more information to hear the 
presentations and then decide what 
more was necessary. Why is it so im-
portant that you have to make that de-
cision now without that information? 
That doesn’t make any sense. 
The rational thing to do is to hear 
what sort of case they present and, im-
portantly, to hear the President’s de-
fense because the President had no op-
portunity in the House to present any 
defense. 
We have heard a lot about the rule of 
law and about precedent. What was un-
precedented was the process that was 
used in the House, a process that began 
with an impeachment inquiry that 
started without any vote by the House. 
This is the point I made earlier. The 
Constitution assigns the sole power of 
impeachment to the House, not to any 
single Member of the House. So the 
press conference that Speaker PELOSI 
held on September 24 did not validly 
initiate an impeachment inquiry, nor 
did it validly give power to committees 
to issue subpoenas. 
We are talking now about the DOD 
documents. What efforts did they make 
in their proceeding to get these docu-
ments? They issued one invalid sub-
poena totally unauthorized under the 
Constitution. It was unprecedented be-
cause it was issued in an impeachment 
inquiry reportedly without any vote 
from the House. It had never happened 
before in our history in a Presidential 
impeachment. It was unlawful. It was 
unauthorized. That is why no docu-
ments were produced, and they made 
no other efforts to pursue that. 
We have heard a lot about the rule of 
law. The rule of law applies to House 
Democrats, as well, and they didn’t 
abide by it. It was unprecedented to 
have a process in which the President 
had no opportunity to present his de-
fense, no opportunity to present wit-
nesses, no opportunity to be rep-
resented by counsel, and no oppor-
tunity to present evidence whatsoever 
in three rounds of hearings. 
They will mention: Oh, in the Judici-
ary Committee, they were willing to 
give the President rights. But in the 
Judiciary Committee, after one hear-
ing, the Speaker announced the conclu-
sion that articles were going to be 
drafted and the committee had already 
decided it would hear no fact witnesses. 
There were no rights for the President. 
So it makes sense, what is rational— 
what 100 Senators 21 years ago thought 
was rational was to hear the case that 
can be presented on the record estab-
lished so far and then decide if some-
thing else needs to be done. Let the 
President make his case. We are ready 
to get this started. The House man-
agers should be as well. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, we yield the balance of our 
time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House 
managers have 38 minutes remaining. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I will be brief. 
Counsel for the President continues 
to say a lot of things that just really 
rubs me the wrong way. When he says: 
You know, we are talking and saying 
the same argument over and over and 
over again, well, I am ready to keep 
going because this is an important de-
bate, and we need to have it now. 
He also said something about what 
the American people don’t understand 
about Washington. Well, I haven’t been 
here very long, but I can tell you that 
I don’t think the American people care 
very much about whether or not people 
in Washington are sitting around de-
bating all the time and thinking about 
what you are concerned about right 
now. What they are concerned about is 
whether or not their government is 
working for them and whether or not 
there is corruption in their govern-
ment. That is what they understand, 
and that is what this debate is about. 
Counsel for the President said: Why 
now? Why the information now? 
The better question is: Why not now? 
This trial has started. Let’s have the 
facts and information now. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the time is 
right. There is no reason why we

shouldn’t issue those subpoenas, get 
the facts, get the testimony, have the 
debate, and let the American people see 
what is really going on. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the balance 
of my time to Mr. SCHIFF. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I 
will be brief, but I do want to respond 
to a couple of points my colleagues 
have made. 
First is the argument that you heard 
before—and I have no doubt you will 
hear again—that the subpoenas issued 
by the House are invalid. Well, that is 
really wonderful. I imagine when you 
issue subpoenas, they will declare 
yours invalid as well. 
What is the basis of the claim that 
they are invalid? It is because they 
weren’t issued the way the President 
wants. 
Part of the argument is that you 
have to issue the subpoenas the way we 
say, and that can only be done after 
there is a resolution that we approve of 
adopted by the full House. First, they 
complained there was no resolution, no 
formal resolution of the impeachment 
inquiry, and then when we passed the 
formal resolution, they complained 
about that. They complained when we 
didn’t have one, and they complained 
when we did have one. 
They made that argument already in 
court, and they lost. In the McGahn 
case, they similarly argued that this 
subpoena for Mr. McGahn is invalid. Do 
you know what the judge said? The 
judge essentially said: That is non-
sense. 
The President doesn’t get to decide 
how the House conducts an impeach-
ment proceeding. The President doesn’t 
get to decide whether a subpoena at 
issue is valid or invalid. No, the House 
gets to decide because the House is 
given the sole power of impeachment, 
not the President of the United States. 
Counsel says: Why are we going 
through all of these documents? Aren’t 
all of these motions the same? The fact 
is, we are not talking about the same 
documents here. They would like noth-
ing better than for you to know noth-
ing about the documents we seek. They 
don’t want you to know what Defense 
Department documents they are with-
holding. Of course, they don’t want you 
to hear that. They don’t want you to 
know what State Department docu-
ments are there because if it is just ab-
stract, if it is just your argument for 
documents, well, they can say: Well, 
that is really not that important, 
right? It is just some generic thing. 
But when you learn, as you have 
learned today and tonight, what those 
documents are, when you have seen the 
efforts to conceal those Freedom of In-
formation Act emails that my col-
league Mr. CROW just referred to, and 
when you see what was released to the 
public, and it is all redacted, and we 
find 
out 
what 
is 
under 
those 
redactions, wow, surprise. It is incrimi-
nating information they have redacted 
out. That is not supposed to be the 
basis for redaction under the Freedom 
of Information Act. That is what we 
call a coverup. 
They don’t want you to see that 
today. They don’t want you to see the 
before and the after, the redacted and 
the nonredacted. They don’t want you 
to hear from these witnesses about the 
detailed personal notes they took. Am-
bassador Taylor took detailed personal 
notes. 
They want to try to contest what 
Ambassador Sondland said about his 
conversations with the President be-
cause Sondland, after he talked with 
the President, talked directly with 
Ambassador Taylor and talked directly 
with Mr. Morrison and explained his 
conversation to the President. Guess 
what. Mr. Morrison and Ambassador 
Taylor took detailed notes. If there is a 
dispute about what the President told 
Mr. Sondland, wouldn’t you like to see 
the notes? They don’t want you to 
know the notes exist. 
They don’t want to have this debate. 
They would rather just argue: No, it is 
just about the documents. It is just 
about when. We want the Senators to 
have their 16 hours of questions before 
they can see any of this stuff. And do 
you know what? Then we are going to 
move to dismiss the case. As I said ear-
lier, the ‘‘when’’ means never. 
Finally, the Clinton precedent. Presi-
dent Clinton turned over 90,000 pages of 
documents before the trial. I agree. 
Let’s follow the Clinton precedent. It is 
not going to take 90,000 documents. 
The documents are already collected. 
You heard the testimony on the 
screen of Ambassador Taylor saying: 
Oh, they are going to turn them over 
shortly. But we are still waiting. They 
are still sitting there at the State De-
partment. 
We even played a video for you of 
Secretary Esper on one of the Sunday 
shows saying, we are going to comply 
with these subpoenas. 
That was one week. Then somebody 
got to him and all of a sudden he was 
singing a different tune. 
They don’t want you to know what 
these documents hold. And, yes, we are 
showing you what these witnesses can 
tell you. We are showing you what 
Mulvaney can tell you. And, yes, we 
are making it hard for you. We are 
making it hard for you to say no. We 
are making it hard for you to say: I 
don’t want to hear from these people. I 
don’t want to see these documents. 
We are making it hard. It is not our 
job to make it easy for you. It is our 
job to make it hard to deprive the 
American people of a fair trial, and 
that is why we are taking the time to 
do it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S417 
January 21, 2020 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, we are a proponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, we are an opponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF and 
the House managers will proceed and 
reserve time for rebuttal. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for the 
President, my name is SYLVIA GARCIA, 
and I am a Congresswoman from Texas 
in the Houston region. 
I have been sitting for some time, as 
well as you, and it brought to mind the 
many years I spent as a judge, just as 
all of you today are judges in this hear-
ing. 
It is important that I say a few words 
before I start our argument for this 
amendment because, in the scheme of 
things, it is really not that very com-
plicated. The American people, every-
day Americans, know what a trial 
looks like, whether they have seen it 
on ‘‘Perry Mason’’ or ‘‘Law & Order,’’ 
or maybe they have been in court 
themselves. They know what a trial is. 
It is about making sure that people 
have an opportunity to be heard—both 
sides. It is about witnesses. It is about 
documents. It is about getting a fair 
shot. 
That is all we are asking for today, is 
to make sure we give the American 
people the trial they expect, to make 
sure the American people know that 
this President needs to be held ac-
countable, because if it were they who 
were accused or alleged to have done 
something, they would want the same 
thing. 
So, for me, it is about making sure 
we get a fair trial, which is why I am 
here representing the House managers 
to strongly support this amendment to 
subpoena Robert Blair and Michael 
Duffey. Blair and Duffey are the two 
officials who carried out President 
Trump’s order to freeze vital military 
aid to Ukraine. Their testimony would 
shed light on central facts the House 
uncovered in our impeachment inquiry. 
Their testimony will further affirm 
that President Trump had no legiti-
mate policy reason for the order. 
Blair works in the White House as a 
senior adviser to the Acting Chief of 
Staff, Mick Mulvaney. Duffey is a po-
litical appointee. He works in the Of-
fice of Management and Budget. There, 
he serves as the Associate Director for 
National 
Security 
Programs. 
Both 
were subpoenaed by the House inves-
tigative committees. Both were or-
dered not to appear, so both failed to 
appear for the scheduled depositions 
despite repeated outreach and despite 
their legal subpoenas to comply. 
Blair and Duffey are not household 
names. Many Americans have never 
heard of them. But they operated the 
machinery of the executive branch. 
They implemented President Trump’s 
instruction to freeze military aid to 
Ukraine. They communicated about 
the 
freeze 
with 
each 
other, 
with 
Mulvaney, with OMB’s Acting Direc-
tor, Russell Vought, and with numer-
ous officials of the State Department 
and the Department of Defense. They 
stood at the center of this tangled web. 
Some of their communications are 
known to us from the testimony of 
other witnesses before House commit-
tees. Other communications have been 
revealed through public reporting and 
the Freedom of Information Act re-
leases. But these communications only 
partly penetrate the secrecy in which 
President Trump sought to cloak his 
instruction to freeze military aid to a 
vulnerable strategic partner. As plenti-
ful 
evidence 
confirms, 
officials 
throughout 
the 
government 
were 
stumped—literally 
stumped—about 
why the freeze was happening. They 
were thwarted when they tried to get 
explanations from Blair and Duffey. 
Consistent with President Trump’s ef-
fort to hide all evidence, Blair and 
Duffey have defied the House’s sub-
poenas at the President’s direction. 
To explain why this amendment 
should be passed, I would like to walk 
you through some key events in which 
Blair and Duffey participated. 
To start, Blair and Duffey were di-
rectly involved in the initial stages of 
President Trump’s freeze of the mili-
tary aid. 
On June 18, the Department of De-
fense issued a statement that it would 
be providing its $250 million portion of 
the assistance to Ukraine and that 
Ukraine had met all the required pre-
conditions for receiving the money. 
The very next day, on June 19, Blair, in 
his role as assistant to the President, 
called Vought, the Acting Director of 
OMB. The call was to talk about the 
military aid to Ukraine. According to 
public reports, Blair told Vought: ‘‘We 
need to hold it up.’’ 
That same day, Duffey, who reports 
to Vought, emailed Deputy Under Sec-
retary of Defense Elaine McCusker 
about the military aid. Although the 
administration refused to produce that 
email to the House—and all other docu-
ments—a copy of that email was re-
cently produced in response to a Free-
dom of Information Act lawsuit. In the 
email, Duffey informed DOD that ‘‘the 
President has asked about this funding 
release.’’ 
Duffey copied Mark Sandy, a career 
official who reports to him and who 
testified before the House about this 
email. Sandy testified that McCusker 
provided the requested information to 
him, which he shared with Duffey. 
These communications raised many 
questions about Blair and Duffey, and 
they are in the best position to provide 
answers. For example, who or what 
prompted Blair to tell Vought that 
OMB needed to freeze the aid? Who? 
What reason was Blair given? Who in-
structed Duffey to reach out to the De-
partment of Defense? Who told him the 
President had questions, and what were 
those questions? Did Duffey and Blair 
have communications about the mili-
tary aid to Ukraine with the Presi-
dent? with Acting Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney? between themselves? What 
about the funding release and the 
President’s so-called questions? Blair 
and Duffey could provide the answers. 
They could explain what directions 
they received, when they were pro-
vided, and who provided them. The 
American people deserve to know these 
facts. 
The next significant event in our 
timeline happened at the end of June. 
On June 27, Blair got an email from his 
boss, Mulvaney. Mulvaney was on Air 
Force One with President Trump. Ac-
cording to public reports, Mulvaney 
asked Blair: ‘‘Did we ever find out 
about the money for Ukraine and 
whether we can hold it back?’’ Blair re-
sponded it would be possible, but he 
said they should ‘‘expect Congress to 
become unhinged.’’ 
When did Mulvaney and Blair first 
discuss the President’s freeze on mili-
tary aid? Was there further discussion 
about the issue in this email? Did 
Mulvaney explain why it was so impor-
tant to freeze the money, even if it 
would cause Congress ‘‘becoming un-
hinged’’? Did they discuss why Con-
gress would have such a strong reac-
tion and whether it would be justified? 
Did Blair raise any objections to this 
seemingly 
unexplained 
decision 
to 
freeze the funds? The Senate could ob-
tain these answers by hearing from 
these witnesses directly. 
Now let’s move on to the implemen-
tation of the freeze. Despite Blair’s 
warning about how Congress would 
react, 
President 
Trump 
ordered 
a 
freeze on military aid to Ukraine in 
July. Blair and Duffey were directly in-
volved in executing the President’s 
order. To be clear, decisions remain 
shrouded in secrecy, but key actions 
have been revealed. 
On July 3, the State Department told 
various officials that OMB was block-
ing it from spending its $141 million 
portion of the aid. More specifically, 
OMB directed the State Department 
not to send a notification to Congress 
about spending the aid. Without that 
notification, the aid was effectively 
frozen. 
Who from OMB ordered the State De-
partment not to send its congressional 
notification? Did they give a reason? 
We just don’t know. Remember, at 
President Trump’s instruction, OMB 
and the State Department refused to 
produce a single document to the 
House, but the direction almost cer-
tainly came from Duffey or one of his 
subordinates, acting on behalf of Presi-
dent Trump. 
We also know that on July 12, Blair 
sent an email to Duffey. Duffey’s sub-
ordinate, Mark Sandy, saw the email 
and described it in his testimony before 
the House. As Sandy testified, it was 
Blair who conveyed that ‘‘the Presi-
dent is directing a hold on military 
support funding for Ukraine.’’ And that 
email only addressed Ukraine. 
Blair’s email raises several questions. 
What other discussions took place 
about the President’s decision to freeze

the aid? Did the President or Mulvaney 
give Blair a reason for the freeze? Did 
Blair know that the President was 
holding the aid to pressure Ukraine to 
announce investigations of his political 
rival? 
We also know that 2 days before Blair 
sent his email to Duffey, Ambassador 
Sondland told Ukrainian officials that 
he had a deal with Mulvaney. The deal 
consisted of a White House visit for 
President Zelensky on Ukraine con-
ducting the political investigations 
that President Trump sought. That is 
what prompted Ambassador Bolton to 
say he was ‘‘not part of whatever drug 
deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cook-
ing up.’’ 
Blair is Mulvaney’s senior adviser. 
Did Blair know about the Sondland/ 
Mulvaney deal? Did he know that they 
were 
leveraging 
an 
official 
White 
House visit for the President to get 
Ukraine to investigate his political 
rival? The White House was unable to 
provide any reason for the hold. 
Throughout 
this 
period, 
officials 
across the executive branch started 
asking questions—questions about the 
freeze on the military aid. Around July 
17 or 18, Duffey emailed Blair. He asked 
about the reason for the freeze, but he 
got no explanation. Instead, Blair in-
sisted: We need to let the hold take 
place and they could revisit the issue 
with the President later. 
In the House, we heard testimony 
from multiple officials, including Am-
bassador Taylor, who was until very re-
cently our top diplomat in Ukraine, 
our numero uno. We also heard from 
several other officials from the Depart-
ment of Defense, the NSC staff, and 
OMB, but no one—no one—heard any 
credible evidence, any credible expla-
nation for the freeze at the time. No 
one. Nada. Senators, think about it. 
Not even our top U.S. diplomat to 
Ukraine had any idea as to why the 
President had ordered the funds frozen. 
That is shocking. That should worry 
every single one of us here. 
Here are some of those witnesses. 
They are up on the slide. Again, no one 
tells why—why this decision was made 
so secretly and without any expla-
nation. Why was the President compro-
mising the safety of his strategic ally 
in the region? Why was he harming our 
national security interests in the proc-
ess? 
On July 26, Duffey attended a meet-
ing of high-level executive branch offi-
cials. Duffey made clear that the freeze 
on military aid was based on President 
Trump’s express direction. 
But, apparently, he could not clearly 
explain whether it was a freeze beyond 
a vague reference to concerns about 
corruption. 
Witnesses who testified before the 
House all provided the same consistent 
recounting of what happened. As you 
can see from the statements on the 
slide, officials were not provided a 
clear explanation for such a dramatic 
step. 
As we have already discussed earlier 
and will explain in more depth during 
the trial, these facts contradict the 
White House’s recent claims of why 
President Trump froze the Ukraine aid. 
Those facts clearly show efforts by this 
President and those around him to fab-
ricate explanations after the Presi-
dent’s illegal scheme came to light. 
In fact, the White House Counsel’s 
own review of the freeze reportedly 
found that Mulvaney and OMB at-
tempted to create an after-the-fact jus-
tification for the President’s decision. 
That 
is 
a 
polite 
way 
of 
saying 
Mulvaney’s team led an effort to cover 
up the President’s conduct and to man-
ufacture misleading pretextual expla-
nations to hide the corruption. 
Senators, there is still more. Blair 
and Duffey were also involved in the 
events surrounding President’s July 25 
phone call with President Zelensky. On 
July 19, Blair, along with other offi-
cials, received an email from Ambas-
sador Sondland. The email described a 
conversation he had just had with 
President 
Zelensky. 
Ambassador 
Sondland stated that Zelensky was 
‘‘prepared to receive POTUS’ call,’’ and 
‘‘will assure him that he intends to run 
a fully transparent investigation’’ and 
will ‘‘turn over every stone.’’ 
As reflected in this email and con-
firmed by his testimony, Ambassador 
Sondland 
had 
helped 
President 
Zelensky prepare for his July 25 phone 
call with President Trump, telling him 
it was necessary to assure President 
Trump that he would conduct the in-
vestigations. 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
then reported back to Blair and others 
that President Zelensky was prepared 
to do just that. 
Blair knew the plan. As Ambassador 
Sondland put it, he was in the loop on 
the scheme. 
Why was Blair part of this group? 
What was his involvement in setting up 
the call? What did he understand 
Sondland’s message to mean? What did 
he 
know 
about 
the 
investigations 
sought by the President? Did he have 
any conversations with the President 
or Mulvaney about the President’s re-
quest for the investigations? We need 
Blair’s testimony to answer these ques-
tions. 
And then, 6 days later, Blair was in 
the Situation Room, listening in—lis-
tening in—on President Trump’s July 
25 call with President Zelensky. He 
heard President Zelensky raise the 
issue of U.S. aid to Ukraine. He heard 
President Trump respond but asked 
him for ‘‘a favor, though’’—namely, in-
vestigations of the 2016 election and of 
Vice President Biden. 
The House heard the testimony of 
three of the other officials who listened 
into the President’s July 25 call—di-
rectly listened in. Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman, Tim Morrison, and Jennifer 
Williams—each of them expressed con-
cerns about the call. Lieutenant Colo-
nel Vindman and Tim Morrison imme-
diately reported the call to NSC law-
yers. Jennifer Williams said the call 
‘‘struck her as unusual and inappro-
priate,’’ and further, ‘‘more political in 
nature.’’ 
Senators, the American people de-
serve to hear if Blair shared the con-
cerns of the other officials who listened 
to the President’s call. What was his 
reaction to the call? Did he take notes? 
Was he at all concerned like the other 
officials? Did he know exactly what 
was happening and why? Did the evi-
dence we have suggest he did know? 
But the Senate should have the oppor-
tunity to ask him directly. 
Just 90 minutes after that July 25 
call, Blair’s contact at OMB, Michael 
Duffey, sent officials of the Depart-
ment of Defense an email to make sure 
that DOD continued to freeze the mili-
tary aid that Ukraine so desperately 
needed. This email, like all others, was 
not produced to the House. However, it 
was produced pursuant to court order 
in a Freedom of Information Act law-
suit. 
As the email reflects, Duffey told the 
DOD officials that based on the guid-
ance he had received, they should 
‘‘hold off any additional DOD obliga-
tions of these funds.’’ 
Duffey added that the request was 
sensitive and that they should keep 
this information closely held. This 
email, too, raises questions that Duffey 
should answer. What exactly was the 
guidance Duffey received? Who gave it 
to him? Was it connected to President 
Trump’s phone call? And why was it so 
sensitive that he directed DOD to keep 
it closely held? The Senate should de-
mand the answers to these questions. 
The Senate should also hear from 
Duffey as to why he abruptly removed 
a career OMB official who questioned 
the freeze on military aid to Ukraine 
and whether he did so at the direction 
of 
the 
White 
House 
or 
President 
Trump. Throughout July, Mark Sandy, 
the OMB career official who handled 
military aid to Ukraine, repeatedly 
tried to get Duffey to provide an expla-
nation for the freeze. He was unsuc-
cessful. 
Sandy and other officials from OMB 
and the Pentagon also raised questions 
about the freeze violating the Em-
powerment Control Act, the Federal 
law that limits the President’s ability 
to withhold funds that have been allo-
cated by Congress. 
In fact, two career OMB officials ulti-
mately resigned, in part, based on con-
cerns 
about 
the 
handling 
of 
the 
Ukraine military aid freeze. These con-
cerns were not unfounded. 
Just last week, the nonpartisan Gov-
ernment Accountability Office issued a 
detailed legal opinion finding that 
OMB had violated Federal law by exe-
cuting the President’s order to freeze 
military aid to Ukraine. Remarkably, 
on July 29, after Sandy had expressed 
his concerns about the legality of the 
freeze, Duffey removed Sandy from re-
sponsibility for Ukraine military aid. 
Instead, Duffey took over responsi-
bility for withholding the aid himself. 
He was a political appointee. He had no 
relevant experience. He had no dem-
onstration of interest in such matters. 
His last job had been as a State-level 
Republican Party official.

S419 
January 21, 2020 
He is the one who took over responsi-
bility for withholding the aid? He gave 
no credible explanation for his deci-
sion. He only said that he wanted to 
become ‘‘more involved in daily oper-
ations.’’ 
Sandy, who has decades of experi-
ence, testified that nothing like this 
had ever happened in his career. His 
boss, a political appointee, just hap-
pened to have a sudden interest in 
being more hands-on and was now 
laser-focused exclusively on Ukraine. 
The Senate should ask Duffey why he 
took over the handling of the Ukraine 
military aid. Was he directed to? Why 
was Sandy removed from his responsi-
bility over Ukraine aid? Was it because 
he expressed concerns about the legal-
ity of the freeze? 
These 
questions 
are 
those 
that 
Duffey would be able to answer. 
Now we move on to warnings from 
DOD. Around this period, in late July 
and early August, Duffey also ignored 
warnings from DOD about the legality 
of the freeze. The Senate should hear 
from him and judge what he has to say. 
Throughout July and August, Duffey 
executed President Trump’s freeze of 
the military aid through a series of 
funding documents from OMB. 
In carefully worded footnotes, OMB 
tried to claim that this ‘‘was a brief 
pause and it would not affect DOD’s 
ability to spend the money on time.’’ 
As we now know from public report-
ing, as a freeze continued, DOD offi-
cials grew more and more alarmed. 
They knew the freeze would impact 
DOD’s ability to spend the funds before 
the end of the fiscal year. DOD offi-
cials, including Deputy Under Sec-
retary McCusker, voiced these con-
cerns to Duffey on multiple occasions. 
First, in an email on August 9, 
McCusker told Duffey DOD could no 
longer support OMB’s claim that the 
freeze would not preclude timely exe-
cution of the aid for Ukraine. Her 
email read: 
As we discussed, as of 12 August, I don’t 
think we can agree that the pause will not 
preclude timely execution. We hope it won’t, 
and we will do all we can to execute once the 
policy decision is made but can no longer 
make that declarative statement. 
Then, again, on August 12, McCusker 
warned Duffey in an email: The foot-
notes needed to include a caveat that 
‘‘execution risk increases continued 
delays.’’ 
The House never received these docu-
ments from OMB or DOD. We know 
what they contain because of public re-
porting, despite persistent efforts by 
the Trump administration to keep 
them from Congress and the public. 
The Pentagon’s alarm should have 
raised concerns for Duffey. Did he 
share DOD’s concerns with anyone 
else? Did he agree with those concerns 
or take any actions in response? Did he 
take direction from Blair, the White 
House, or President Trump? These are 
questions that Duffey should answer. 
Despite his actions executing the 
President’s freeze, Duffey internally 
expressed reservations about it. In Au-
gust, he signed off on a memorandum 
to Acting Director Vought that rec-
ommended releasing the aid. That 
memo stated that the military aid was 
consistent with the United States’ na-
tional security strategy in the region, 
that it served to counter Russian ag-
gression, and that the aid was rooted in 
bipartisan support in Congress. This is 
contrary to Duffey’s actions leading up 
to the memo. What changed? What 
caused Duffey to disagree with the 
President’s direction to continue to 
withhold the aid? Duffey should be 
called to explain why he recommended 
that the President release the aid, 
what other steps he took to advocate 
for the release. Does he know why 
Vought and the White House appar-
ently disregarded the recommenda-
tion? 
Based on public reporting, we know, 
after the press reported the freeze in 
late August, OMB circulated talking 
points falsely claiming ‘‘no action has 
been taken by OMB that would pre-
clude the obligation of these funds be-
fore the end of the fiscal year.’’ 
According 
to 
public 
reporting, 
McCusker responded with an email to 
Duffey to tell him that this was ‘‘just 
not accurate’’ and that DOD had been 
‘‘consistently 
conveying’’ 
that 
for 
weeks. Due to the public release of 
these emails and recent reporting, we 
also 
know 
that 
Duffey 
emailed 
McCusker on August 30 and told her 
there was a ‘‘clear direction from 
POTUS’’ to continue the freeze. 
McCusker continued to warn that the 
freeze was having real effects on DOD’s 
ability to spend the military aid, and 
the impact would keep growing if the 
freeze continued. According to recent 
reports, around September 9, after the 
President’s scheme had been exposed 
and the House had launched its inves-
tigations, 
Duffey 
responded 
to 
McCusker’s warnings with a formal and 
lengthy email. He asserted it would be 
DOD’s fault, not OMB’s, if DOD was un-
able to spend funds in time. Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense Elaine 
McCusker reportedly responded: ‘‘I am 
speechless.’’ 
We now know that DOD’s concerns 
were 
well-founded. 
The 
President’s 
freeze on the security aid was illegal. 
Duffey should be called to testify about 
why DOD’s repeated warnings went 
unheeded. What prompted his email 
that attempted to shift blame to DOD 
about the fact that the President re-
leased the aid only after his scheme 
was exposed? 
Senators, make no mistake. We have 
a detailed factual record showing the 
freeze was President Trump’s decision 
and that he did it to pressure Ukraine 
to announce the political investiga-
tions he wanted. 
But President Trump’s decisions also 
set off a cascade of confusion and mis-
direction within the executive branch. 
As the President’s political appointees 
carried out his orders, career officials 
tried to do their jobs—or, at the very 
least, not break the law. Blair and 
Duffey would help shed more light on 
how the President’s orders were carried 
out. That is why committees of the 
House issued subpoenas for both of 
their testimony, but Blair and Duffey, 
as I said earlier, like many other 
Trump officials, refused to appear be-
cause the President ordered them not 
to appear. I might add, as a former 
judge, I have never seen anything like 
this before, where someone is ordered 
not to appear by one party and the wit-
nesses just don’t appear. 
The Senate should not allow the 
President and his administration to 
continue to evade accountability based 
on 
these 
ever-shifting 
and 
ever- 
meritless excuses. We need to hold him 
accountable because no one is above 
the law. 
(English translation of statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
No one is above the law. 
Blair and Duffey have valuable testi-
mony to offer. The Senate should call 
upon them to do their duty by issuing 
this subpoena. 
Mr. Chief Justice, the House man-
agers reserve the balance of our time 
for an opportunity to respond to the 
President’s argument. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Pam Bondi, Special Advisor to 
the President, former attorney general 
of Florida. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Ms. Bondi. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. Honorable Sen-
ators, just to fact-correct, please, a few 
things. Mr. Duffey didn’t come from a 
State job. Mr. Duffey came from Dep-
uty Chief of Staff at DOD before he 
went to OMB. There is a big difference 
there. 
Manager Garcia said he failed to ap-
pear. Well, the House committee would 
not allow agency counsel to appear 
with Mr. Duffey or Mr. Blair. They 
would not let agency counsel appear 
with either of them. 
Office of Legal Counsel determined, 
of course, that the exclusion of agency 
counsel from House proceedings is un-
constitutional. It is a pretty basic 
right. So what did they do? They took 
no action on the subpoenas, but now 
they want you to take action on them. 
What the House managers have been 
telling you all day is that the White 
House is trying to hide from American 
people what witnesses had to say. They 
have been saying we want to bury evi-
dence; we want to hide evidence. That 
hypocrisy is astounding. They have 
been saying: Let’s not forget why we 
are here. 
Well, we are here tonight because 
they threw due process, fundamental 
fairness, and our Constitution out the 
window in the House proceedings. That 
is why we are here—because they start-
ed in the secret bunker hearings where 
the President and his counsel weren’t 
even allowed to participate when they 
were trying to impeach him. 
Intel and Judiciary Committee was a 
one-sided 
circus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S420 
January 21, 2020 
NUNES asked to call witnesses. He ex-
plained why in detail. It was denied by 
Manager SCHIFF. Ranking Member COL-
LINS asked to call witnesses, which was 
denied by Manager NADLER. And that is 
what they call fairness? That is not 
how 
our 
American 
justice 
system 
works, and it is certainly not how our 
impeachment process is designed by 
our Constitution. 
The House took no action on the sub-
poenas issued to Mr. Duffey and Mr. 
Blair because they didn’t want a court 
to tell them that they were trampling 
on their constitutional rights. Now 
they want this Chamber to do it for 
them. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, we yield the remainder of our 
time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. House man-
agers have 24 minutes remaining. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, a couple of fact checks, once 
again. 
First of all, the complaint is made 
that, well, the House wouldn’t allow 
agency counsel. Why wouldn’t the 
House allow agency counsel to be 
present in those secret depositions that 
you have been hearing so much about? 
As I mentioned earlier, those secret 
depositions allowed 100 Members of the 
House to participate. There are 100 
Members of the Senate. We could have 
had that secret deposition right here 
on the Senate floor. During those depo-
sitions, Members of both parties were 
given equal time to ask questions of 
these witnesses. 
By the way, where did Democrats get 
that rule of no agency counsel during 
these depositions? We got it from the 
Republicans. This was the Republican 
deposition rule, and we can cite you ad-
amant explanations by Trey Gowdy 
and others about how these rules are so 
important that the depositions not be 
public, that agency counsel be ex-
cluded. 
And why? Well, you get a good sense 
of it when you see the testimony of 
Deputy Assistant Secretary George 
Kent. Kent describes how he is at a 
meeting with some of the State De-
partment lawyers and others, and they 
are talking about the document re-
quest from Congress and what are they 
going to do about these and what docu-
ments are responsive and what docu-
ments aren’t responsive. The issue 
comes up in a letter the State Depart-
ment sent to Congress saying: You are 
intimidating the witnesses. Secretary 
Kent testified: No, no, no. The Con-
gress wasn’t intimidating witnesses; it 
was the State Department that was in-
timidating witnesses to try to prevent 
them from testifying. 
My colleagues at the other table say: 
Why aren’t you allowing the Members 
from the State Department to sit next 
to those witnesses and hear what they 
have to say in the depositions? We have 
seen all too much witness intimidation 
in this investigation, to begin with, 
without having an agency minder sit-
ting in on the deposition. 
By the way, those agency minders 
don’t get to sit in on grand jury inter-
views either. There is a very good in-
vestigative reason that has been used 
by Republicans and Democrats who 
have been adamant about the policy of 
excluding agency counsel. 
It was also represented that the In-
telligence Committee and the Judici-
ary Committee wouldn’t allow the mi-
nority to call any witnesses. That is 
just not true. In fact, fully one-third of 
the witnesses who appeared in open 
hearing in our committee were minor-
ity-chosen witnesses. What they ended 
up having to say was pretty darn in-
criminating of the President, but, 
nonetheless, they chose them. 
So about this idea that, well, we had 
no due process, the fact of the matter 
is, we followed the procedures in the 
Clinton and Nixon impeachments. They 
can continue to say we didn’t, but we 
did. In some respects, we gave even 
greater due process opportunities here 
than there. The fact that the President 
would take no advantage of them 
doesn’t change the fact that they had 
that opportunity. 
Finally, the claim is made that we 
trampled on the constitutional rights 
by daring to subpoena these witnesses. 
How dare we subpoena administration 
officials—right?—because 
Congress 
never does that. How dare we do that. 
How dare we subpoena them. Well, the 
court heard that argument in the case 
of Don McGahn, and you should read 
the judge’s opinion in finding that this 
claim of absolute immunity has no sup-
port, no substance; it would have re-
sulted in a monarchy. It is essentially 
the judicial equivalent of: Don’t let the 
door hit you in the backside on the 
way out, Counsel. There is no merit 
there. 
Counsel can repeat that argument as 
often as they like, but there is no sup-
port in the courts for it. There should 
be no support for it in this body, not if 
you want any of your subpoenas in the 
future to mean anything at all. 
I yield back.

leader is recognized.

AMENDMENT NO. 1290 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send an amendment to the desk to pre-
vent the selective admission of evi-
dence and provide for the appropriate 
handling of classified and confidential 
materials, and I ask that it be read. It 
is short. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
read the amendment. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHUMER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1290. 
On page 2, between lines 4 and 5, insert the 
following: 
If, during the impeachment trial of Donald 
John Trump, any party seeks to admit evi-
dence that has not been submitted as part of 
the record of the House of Representatives 
and that was subject to a duly authorized 
subpoena, that party shall also provide the 
opposing party all other documents respon-
sive to that subpoena. For the purposes of 
this paragraph, the term ‘‘duly authorized 
subpoena’’ includes any subpoena issued pur-
suant to the impeachment inquiry of the 
House of Representatives. 
The Senate shall take all necessary meas-
ures to ensure the proper handling of con-
fidential and classified information in the 
record. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Let’s take a 5- 
minute break. I ask everybody to stay 
close to the Chamber. We will go with 
a hard 5 minutes.

RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF 
THE CHAIR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate stand in recess subject to the call 
of the Chair. 
There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 11:19 p.m., recessed until 11:39 p.m. 
and reassembled when called to order 
by the CHIEF JUSTICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, are 
you in favor or opposed?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S421 
January 21, 2020 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. In favor. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. 
Counselor 
CIPOLLONE. 
Mr. 
Chief Justice, we are opposed. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. There are 2 
hours for argument, equally divided. 
Mr. SCHIFF, you may proceed first. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, the 
majority leader amended his resolution 
earlier today to allow the admission of 
the House record into evidence, though 
the resolution leaves the record subject 
to objections. 
But there is a gaping hole—another 
gaping hole—in the resolution. The res-
olution would allow the President to 
cherry-pick documents he has refused 
to produce to the House and attempt to 
admit them into evidence here. 
That would enable the President to 
use his obstruction not only as a shield 
to his misconduct but also as a sword 
in his defense. That would be patently 
unfair and wholly improper. It must 
not be permitted, and that is what the 
Schumer amendment addresses. 
The amendment addresses that issue 
by providing that if any party seeks to 
admit, for the first time here, informa-
tion that was previously subject to 
subpoena, that party must do a simple 
and fair thing; it must provide the op-
posing party all of the other documents 
responsive to the subpoena. That is 
how the law works in America. It is 
called the rule of completeness. 
When the selective introduction of 
evidence distorts facts or sows confu-
sion in a trial, there is a solution. It is 
to ensure that documents that provide 
for a complete picture can be intro-
duced to avert such distortions and 
confusion. 
The rule of completeness is rooted in 
the commonsense evidentiary principle 
that a fair trial does not permit the 
parties to selectively introduce evi-
dence in a way that would mislead 
factfinders. The Senators should em-
brace it as a rule for this trial, and the 
amendment does just that. 
This amendment does not in any way 
limit the evidence the President may 
introduce during his trial. He should be 
able to defend himself against the 
charges against him as every defendant 
has the right to do around the country. 
But this amendment does make sure 
that he does it in a fair way and that 
his obstruction cannot be used as a 
weapon. 
It is an amendment based on simple 
fairness, and it will help the Senate 
and the American people get to the 
truth. 
House managers are not afraid of the 
evidence, whatever it may be. We want 
an open process designed to get to the 
truth, no matter whether it helps or 
hurts our case. That is what the Senate 
should want, and that is what the 
American people certainly want. 
This amendment helps that process 
of getting more evidence so we can get 
to the truth, and we urge you to vote 
for it. 
The amendment also addresses an-
other omission in the majority leader’s 
resolution by providing for the proper 
handling of confidential and classified 
information 
for 
the 
record. 
This 
amendment 
seeks 
to 
balance 
the 
public’s interest in transparency with 
the importance of protecting limited, 
sensitive information bearing directly 
on the case you are trying. 
As for confidential information, some 
of the evidence in this case includes 
records of phone calls. They establish 
important patterns of conduct, as we 
explain in the Ukraine impeachment 
report. 
But the original phone records, in-
cluding a great deal more information 
in context, should be available for this 
body to review if needed in a confiden-
tial setting. It contains personally sen-
sitive information concerning individ-
uals who are not at issue in this trial 
and would potentially subject them to 
intrusions on their privacy. 
The Secretary of the Senate has the 
capacity to handle such material and 
make it available to you as needed. 
The amendment allows the privacy 
interests of many individuals to be pro-
tected, while allowing the Senators ac-
cess to the full record. 
As for the classified information that 
this amendment addresses, there may 
be several very relevant classified doc-
uments. 
Let me just highlight one in par-
ticular. It involves the testimony of 
the Vice President’s national security 
aide, Jennifer Williams, and it con-
cerns a conversation between the Vice 
President 
and 
the 
President 
of 
Ukraine, and the House managers be-
lieve that it would be of value to this 
body to see, in trying the case. 
Let me start by saying that we have 
twice requested that the Vice Presi-
dent declassify this document. We have 
reviewed it, and there is no basis to 
keep it classified. The Vice President 
has not responded, and we can only 
conclude this was an additional effort 
by the President to conceal wrongdoing 
from the public. But as it stands now, 
it remains classified. It must be han-
dled like any other classified document 
by this body in a method that would 
allow them. 
Let me just take a moment to go fur-
ther. The public should see that supple-
mental testimony as well. That supple-
mental testimony—that classified tes-
timony—was added to the record by 
the Vice President’s aide because she 
believed, I think, on further reflection, 
that it would shed additional light on 
what she has said publicly. You should 
see it and you should evaluate it for 
what it has to say, but, what is more, 
so should the American people. 
So I would urge not only that you 
support this amendment to make sure 
that you can handle the classified in-
formation, there is a mechanism for it, 
and personal identifiable information 
need not be made public, but also infor-
mation that is improperly classified 
that bears or sheds light on her deci-
sion should be accessible to you and 
should be accessible to the American 
people. 
I reserve the balance of our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Philbin and 
Mr. Sekulow will argue. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Philbin. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Members of the Senate, the 
President opposes this amendment, and 
I can be brief in explaining why. 
This amendment would say that any 
subpoena that was issued pursuant to 
the House’s impeachment inquiry—any 
subpoena that they issued at all—be-
comes defined as a duly authorized sub-
poena for purposes of this amendment. 
As we have explained several times 
today, because the House began this in-
quiry without taking a vote, it never 
authorized any of its committees to 
issue subpoenas pursuant to the im-
peachment power. 
The first 23 subpoenas, at a min-
imum, that the House committees 
issued were all unauthorized in ultra 
vires, and that is why the Trump ad-
ministration did not respond to them 
and did not comply with them. That 
was explained in a letter of October 18, 
from White House Counsel Cipollone to 
Chairman SCHIFF and others, that it is 
a legal infirmity in those subpoenas. 
There has never been an impeach-
ment inquiry initiated by the House of 
Representatives against a President of 
the United States without it being au-
thorized by a vote of the full House. 
This is a principle that the Supreme 
Court has made clear in cases such as 
United States vs. Rumely, that no 
committee of Congress can exercise au-
thority assigned by the Constitution to 
the Chamber itself, of the House or the 
Senate, without being delegated that 
authority by the House or the Senate. 
In Rumely, the Court explains that 
to determine the validity of a subpoena 
requires ‘‘construing the scope of the 
authority which the House of Rep-
resentatives gave to the committee.’’ 
So this is a legal issue, an infirmity 
in those subpoenas, and this amend-
ment proposes to do away with that 
legal infirmity by defining all their 
subpoenas as duly authorized, and we 
do not support that amendment. 
In addition to that, I just want to re-
spond briefly to Chairman SCHIFF’s de-
scription of the rule of completeness. 
This is not about the rule of complete-
ness. The rule of completeness has to 
do with a particular document or a par-
ticular piece of evidence which is mis-
leading in itself. With that document, 
if there is something specific about it 
that there is another response on the 
email chain—something like that— 
that particular document has some 
specific thing attached to it, and then 
that should also come into evidence. 
But since all the evidentiary motions 
are being preserved and objections can 
be made later, evidentiary arguments 
under the underlying resolution can be 
made. The rule of completeness can be 
argued. There is no need for that to do 
this amendment, because this amend-
ment doesn’t have anything to do with 
the rule of completeness.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S422 
January 21, 2020 
With that, I will yield the remainder 
of my time to Mr. Sekulow. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the 
Senate. I will be brief. This amendment 
to the resolution we oppose, as Mr. 
Philbin just said, because it is in es-
sence an unconstitutional attempt to 
cure a defect—a defect in their own 
proceeding. 
To be clear, we are reserving our ob-
jections as it relates to hearsay, which 
is what the record primarily consists 
of. 
I also want to respond very briefly to 
what Manager SCHIFF said regarding 
the proceedings in the House of Rep-
resentatives and the lack of agency 
counsel. He said it is much like the 
grand jury. He best be glad and the 
Members of his committee best be glad 
that it is not like a grand jury, because 
if it was a grand jury and information 
was leaked, which it was consistently 
throughout this process, they could be 
subject to felony. 
So I want to be clear. Utilizing this 
amendment to cure a constitutional 
defect—and that is what this is—is ex-
actly what we have been arguing about 
now for almost 11 hours. It is changing 
the rules. It is different rules. 
I can’t determine if we are dealing 
with a trial, a pretrial motion—but we 
have now have spent 11 hours arguing 
about something that we will be argu-
ing again next week. 
But the idea that you can cure in 
three paragraphs constitutional defects 
doesn’t pass constitutional muster. 
We yield the rest of our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House 
managers have 54 minutes remaining. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, first of 
all, the counsel makes the argument 
once again that with subpoenas, the 
President gets to decide which are 
valid and which are invalid, and any 
subpoena the President doesn’t like, he 
may simply declare invalid, and that is 
the end of the story. Therefore, it is in-
valid, and no documents are required, 
and no witnesses need to show up, and, 
therefore, you don’t need to consider 
whether the President should be able 
to game the system by showing you a 
handful of documents to mislead you 
and deprive you of seeing all of the 
other documents relevant to that same 
subject. That is their argument. The 
President didn’t like the way the sub-
poenas were issued, even though the 
Court has already ruled on this issue 
and said: No, Mr. President, you don’t 
get to decide whether a subpoena is 
valid or not in an impeachment pro-
ceeding. That is the sole responsibility 
of the House. 
But no, I guess they would suggest to 
you the President would never mislead 
you about documents. If they seek to 
introduce something, you can be as-
sured that that document tells the 
complete truth. 
But we already know you can place 
no such reliance on the President. How 
do we know this? We have already seen 
it. 
Look at what they did in response to 
the FOIA, or Freedom of Information 
Act, requests. They blacked out all the 
incriminating 
information. 
They 
blacked out the ‘‘we can’t represent 
any more that we are going to be able 
to actually spend this money in time. 
We can’t represent that we are not 
going to be in violation of the law of 
the Impoundment Act.’’ They redact 
that. 
Is that what you want in this trial, 
for them to be able to introduce one 
part of an email chain and not show 
you the rest? 
You want to be able to have a situa-
tion where the President has withheld 
all these documents from you, can in-
troduce a document that suggests a be-
nign explanation but not the reply that 
confirms the corrupt explanation, be-
cause that is what we are really talk-
ing about here. 
Now they clothe this in the argument 
that, well, we don’t think these were 
duly authorized subpoenas. We are 
merely categorizing the universe of 
documents they should turn over if 
they want to turnover selective docu-
ments. Let them call them unduly au-
thorized, therefore. The point is, that 
the documents that should be turned 
over should not be cherry-picked by a 
White House that has already shown 
such a deliberate intent to deceive. 
Finally, counsel says they can’t tell 
whether we are dealing with a trial 
here. Well, do you know something? 
Neither can we. If they are confused, 
they are confused for a good reason, be-
cause this doesn’t look like any other 
trial that they are used to. People 
watching—they are confused, too, be-
cause they would think if this was a 
trial, there would be no debate about 
whether the party with the burden of 
proof could call witnesses. Of course, 
they could. Of course, they can. 
The defendant doesn’t get to decide 
who the prosecution can call as a wit-
ness. If you are confused, so is the pub-
lic. They want this to look like a reg-
ular trial, and it should. That has been 
the history of this body. That has been 
the history of this body. 
Now I know it is late, but I have to 
tell you it doesn’t have to be late. We 
don’t control the schedule here. We are 
not deciding we want to carry on 
through the evening. We don’t get to 
decide the schedule. 
There is a reason for why we are still 
here at 5 minutes to midnight. There is 
a reason why we are here at 5 minutes 
to midnight, and that is because they 
don’t want the American people to see 
what is going on here. They are hoping 
people are asleep. You know, a lot of 
people are asleep right now, all over 
the country, because it is midnight. 
Now, maybe in my State of Cali-
fornia people are still awake and 
watching, but is this really what we 
should be doing when we are deciding 
the fate of a Presidency—that we 
should be doing this in the midnight 
hour? 
I started out the day asking whether 
there could be a fair trial and express-
ing the skepticism I think the country 
feels about whether that is possible, 
how much they want to believe this is 
possible. But I have to say, watching 
now at midnight, this effort to hide 
this in the dead of night cannot be en-
couraging to them about whether there 
will be a fair trial. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S423 
January 21, 2020 
rules V and VI of the Rules of Procedure and 
Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Im-
peachment Trials, the Chief Justice of the 
United States, through the Secretary of the 
Senate, shall issue a subpoena for the taking 
of testimony of John Robert Bolton, and the 
Sergeant at Arms is authorized to utilize the 
services of the Deputy Sergeant at Arms or 
any other employee of the Senate in serving 
the subpoena authorized to be issued by this 
section. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amend-
ment is arguable by the parties with 2 
hours equally divided. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF, are you a pro-
ponent? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Yes, I am. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, 
are you an opponent? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Yes, Mr. 
Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
you may proceed, and you may reserve 
time for rebuttal. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Before I 
begin, Mr. Chief Justice, the House 
managers will be reserving the balance 
of our time to respond to the argu-
ments of the counsel for the President. 
Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel 
for the President, the House managers 
strongly support this amendment to 
subpoena John Bolton. I am struck by 
what we have heard from the Presi-
dent’s counsel so far tonight. They 
complain about process, but they do 
not seriously contest any of the allega-
tions against the President. They in-
sist that the President has done noth-
ing wrong, but they refuse to allow the 
evidence and hear from the witnesses. 
They will not permit the American 
people to hear from the witnesses, and 
they lie and lie and lie and lie. 
For example, for months, President 
Trump has repeatedly complained that 
the House denied them the right to call 
witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses, 
and so forth. You heard Mr. Cipollone 
repeat this lie today. Well, I have with 
me the letter that I sent as Chairman 
of the House Judiciary Committee last 
November 26, inviting the President 
and his counsel to attend our hearings, 
to cross-examine the witnesses, to call 
witnesses of his own, and so forth. I 
also have the White House letter signed 
by Mr. Cipollone, rejecting that offer. 
We should expect at least a little re-
gard for the truth from the White 
House, but that is apparently too much 
to expect. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a trial. 
At a trial, the lawyers present evi-
dence. The American people know that. 
Most 10-year-olds know that. If you 
vote to block this witness or any of the 
evidence that should be presented here, 
it can only be because you do not want 
the American people to hear the evi-
dence, that you do not want a fair 
trial, and that you are complicit in 
President Trump’s efforts to hide his 
misconduct and hide the truth from 
the American people. 
Ambassador Bolton was appointed by 
President Trump. He has stated his 
willingness to testify in this trial. He 
is prepared to testify. He says that he 
has relevant evidence not yet disclosed 
to the public. His comments reaffirm 
what is obvious from the testimony 
and documents obtained by the House, 
which highlight Ambassador Bolton’s 
role in the repeated criticism of the 
President’s misconduct. 
In fact, extensive evidence collected 
by the House makes clear that Ambas-
sador Bolton not only had firsthand 
knowledge of the Ukraine scheme but 
that he was deeply concerned with it. 
He described the scheme as a ‘‘drug 
deal’’ to a senior member of the staff. 
He warned that President Trump’s per-
sonal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, would 
‘‘blow everybody up.’’ Indeed, in ad-
vance of the July 25, 2019, call, Ambas-
sador Bolton expressed concern that 
President 
Trump 
would 
ask 
the 
Ukrainian President to announce these 
political investigations, which is, of 
course, exactly what happened. Of 
course, there weren’t to be any inves-
tigations. All he cared about was an 
announcement to smear a political 
rival in the United States. He repeat-
edly urged his staff to report their own 
concerns about the President’s conduct 
to legal counsel—that is, Ambassador 
Bolton did, not the President—as the 
scheme was unfolding. 
Finally, as National Security Advi-
sor, he also objected to the President’s 
freezing of military aid to Ukraine and 
advocated for the release of that aid, 
including 
directly 
with 
President 
Trump. Of course, as we all know, the 
Impoundment Control Act makes ille-
gal the President’s withholding of that 
aid after Congress had voted for it, but 
the President ignored the warnings 
about that because all he cared about 
was smearing a political rival. The law 
meant nothing to him. 
Ambassador Bolton has made clear 
that he is ready, willing, and able to 
testify about everything he witnessed, 
but President Trump does not want 
you to hear from Ambassador Bolton, 
and the reason has nothing to do with 
executive privilege or this other non-
sense. The reason has nothing to do 
with national security. If the President 
cared 
about 
national 
security, 
he 
would not have blocked military assist-
ance to a vulnerable strategic ally in 
the attempt to secure a personal polit-
ical favor for himself. 
No, the President does not want you 
to hear from Ambassador Bolton be-
cause the President does not want the 
American people to hear firsthand tes-
timony about the misconduct at the 
heart of this trial. The question is 
whether the Senate will be complicit in 
the President’s crimes by covering 
them up. Any Senator who votes 
against 
Ambassador 
Bolton’s 
testi-
mony or any relevant testimony shows 
that he or she wants to be part of the 
coverup. What other possible reason is 
there to prohibit a relevant witness 
from testifying here? Unfortunately, so 
far, I have seen every Republican Sen-
ator has shown that they want to be 
part of the coverup by voting against 
every document and witness proposed. 
Ambassador Bolton is a firsthand 
witness to President Trump’s abuse of 
power. As the National Security Advi-
sor, he reported directly to the Presi-
dent and supervised the entire National 
Security Council. That included three 
key witnesses with responsibility for 
Ukraine matters who testified in great 
detail before the House—Dr. Fiona Hill, 
Tim Morrison, and LTC Alexander 
Vindman. 
Moreover, in his role, John Bolton 
was the tip of the spear for President 
Trump on national security. It was his 
responsibility to oversee everything 
happening in the Trump administra-
tion regarding foreign policy and na-
tional security. By virtue of his unique 
position appointed by the President, 
Bolton had knowledge of the latest in-
telligence and developments in our re-
lationship with Ukraine, including our 
support of the country and its new 
President, and that is why the Presi-
dent and some Members of this body 
are afraid to hear from Ambassador 
Bolton—because they know he knows 
too much. 
There is also substantial evidence 
that Ambassador Bolton kept a keen 
eye on Rudy Giuliani, who was acting 
on behalf of the President in connec-
tion with Ukraine. As we will describe, 
Ambassador Bolton communicated di-
rectly with Mr. Giuliani at key mo-
ments. He knows the details of the so- 
called drug deal he would later warn 
against. 
Perhaps most importantly, Ambas-
sador Bolton has said both that he will 
testify and that he has relevant infor-
mation that has not yet been disclosed. 
A key witness has come forward and 
confirmed not only that he partici-
pated in critically important events 
but that he has new evidence we have 
not yet heard. That is precisely what 
Ambassador Bolton has done. His law-
yer tells us that Ambassador Bolton 
was ‘‘personally involved in many of 
the events, meetings, and conversa-
tions about which the House heard tes-
timony, as well as many relevant meet-
ings and conversations that have not 
yet been discussed in the testimony 
thus far.’’ 
Ambassador Bolton was requested as 
a witness in the House inquiry, but he 
refused to appear voluntarily. His law-
yers informed the House Intelligence 
Committee that Ambassador Bolton 
would take the matter to court if 
issued a subpoena, as his subordinate 
did, but the Ambassador changed his 
tune. He recently issued a statement 
confirming that ‘‘if the Senate issues a 
subpoena for my testimony, I am pre-
pared to testify.’’ 
So the question presented as to Am-
bassador Bolton is clear. It comes down 
to this: Will the Senate do its duty and 
hear all the evidence? Or will it slam 
this door shut and show it is partici-
pating in a coverup because it fears to 
hear testimony from the former Na-
tional Security Advisor of the Presi-
dent, because it fears what he might 
say or it fears he knows too much?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S424 
January 21, 2020 
Consider this as well: Why is Presi-
dent Trump so intent on preventing us 
from hearing Ambassador Bolton, his 
own appointee, his formerly trusted 
confidant? 
Because 
he 
knows—he 
knows—his guilt and he knows that he 
doesn’t want people who know about it 
to testify. The question is whether Re-
publican Senators here today will par-
ticipate in that coverup. 
The reasons seem clear. President 
Trump wants to block this witness be-
cause Ambassador Bolton has direct 
knowledge of the Ukraine scheme, 
which he called a drug deal. Let’s start 
with the key meeting that took place 
on July 10. 
Just 
2 
weeks 
before 
President 
Trump’s now famous July 25 call with 
President 
Zelensky, 
Ambassador 
Bolton hosted senior Ukrainian offi-
cials in his West Wing office. That 
meeting included Dr. Hill, Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman, 
Ambassadors 
Sondland and Volker, and Energy Sec-
retary Rick Perry. As they did in every 
meeting they took with U.S. officials, 
Ukrainian officials asked when Presi-
dent Trump would schedule a White 
House meeting for the newly elected 
Ukrainian President because it was 
very 
important 
for 
the 
Ukrainian 
President, a new President of an em-
battled democracy being invaded by 
Russia, to show that he had legitimacy 
by a meeting with the United States. 
Dr. Hill testified that Ambassador 
Sondland blurted out that he had a 
deal with Mr. Mulvaney for a White 
House visit, provided that Ukraine first 
announce investigations into the Presi-
dent’s 
political 
rivals. 
Ambassador 
Bolton 
immediately 
stiffened 
and 
ended the meeting. Dr. Hill’s testimony 
is on the screen. 
In other words, Ambassador Bolton 
and others at the meeting were inter-
ested in the national security of the 
United States. They were interested in 
protecting an American ally against 
Russian invasion. They couldn’t under-
stand why this sudden order was com-
ing from the President to abandon that 
ally because they didn’t yet know— 
they didn’t yet know—of the Presi-
dent’s plot to try to extort the Ukrain-
ian Government into doing him a polit-
ical favor by announcing an investiga-
tion of a political rival. 
When Dr. Hill reported back to Am-
bassador Bolton about the second con-
versation, Ambassador Bolton told Dr. 
Hill to go to the National Security 
Council’s 
legal 
advisor, 
John 
Eisenberg, and tell him: ‘‘I am not part 
of whatever drug deal Sondland and 
Mulvaney are cooking up on this.’’ 
Here is an excerpt of her hearing tes-
timony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. HILL. The specific instruction was 
that I had to go to the lawyers—to John 
Eisenberg, the senior counsel for the Na-
tional Security Council, to basically say: 
You tell Eisenberg Ambassador Bolton told 
me that I am not part of this—whatever drug 
deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cook-
ing up. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What did you understand 
him to mean by the drug deal that Mulvaney 
and Sondland were cooking up? 
Ms. HILL. I took it to mean investigations 
for a meeting. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you go speak to the 
lawyers? 
Ms. HILL. I certainly did. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. These state-
ments of events are reason enough to 
insist that Ambassador Bolton testify. 
He can explain the misconduct that 
caused him to characterize the Ukraine 
scheme as a drug deal and why he di-
rected his subordinates to report their 
concerns to a legal counsel. He can tell 
us everything else he knows about how 
Ambassador Sondland, Mr. Mulvaney, 
and others were attempting to press 
the 
Ukrainians 
to 
do 
President 
Trump’s political bidding. Once more, 
only Ambassador Bolton can tell us 
what he was thinking and what he 
knew as this scheme developed. That is 
why the President fears his testimony. 
That is why some Members of this body 
fear his testimony. 
Ambassador 
Bolton’s 
involvement 
was not limited to a few isolated 
events; he was a witness at key mo-
ments in the course of the Ukraine 
scheme, especially in July, August, and 
September of last year. I would like to 
walk through some of these events. 
Please remember, as I am describing 
them, that this is not the entire uni-
verse of issues to which Ambassador 
Bolton could testify; they are only ex-
amples that show why he is such an im-
portant witness and why the President 
is desperate to block his testimony. 
We know from Ambassador Bolton’s 
attorney that there may be other 
meetings and conversations that have 
not yet come to our attention. To take 
one example, we know from witness 
testimony that Ambassador Bolton re-
peatedly expressed concerns about the 
involvement of President Trump’s per-
sonal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani. 
In the spring and summer of 2019, 
Ambassador Bolton caught wind of Mr. 
Giuliani’s involvement in Ukraine and 
soon began to express concerns. Am-
bassador Bolton expressed strong con-
cerns about Mr. Giuliani’s involvement 
in Ukraine matters. 
When Ambassador Bolton described 
Mr. Giuliani as ‘‘a hand grenade that 
was going to blow everybody up,’’ it 
was 
based 
on 
his 
fear 
that 
Mr. 
Giuliani’s work on behalf of the Presi-
dent, his attempts to have Ukraine an-
nounce 
these 
investigations—these 
sham investigations—and his campaign 
to 
smear 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
would ultimately backfire and cause 
lasting damage to the President. It 
turns out he was right. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. SEWELL. Did your boss, Dr. Bolton— 
I mean Ambassador Bolton, tell you that 
Giuliani was ‘‘a hand grenade’’? 
Ms. HILL. He did, yes. 
Ms. SEWELL. What do you think he meant 
by his characterization of Giuliani as a hand 
grenade? 
Ms. HILL. What he meant by this was pret-
ty clear to me in the context of all of the 
statements that Mr. Giuliani was making 
publicly about the investigations that he 
was promoting, that the story line he was 
promoting, the narrative he was promoting 
was going to backfire. I think it has back-
fired. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. In June, as 
Ambassador Bolton became aware of 
Mr. Giuliani’s coordination with Am-
bassadors Volker and Sondland, he told 
Dr. Hill and other members of the Na-
tional Security Council staff that ‘‘no-
body should be meeting with Giuliani.’’ 
But, he, of course, did not know of the 
President’s plot as to why people were 
meeting with Giuliani. 
Dr. Hill also testified that Ambas-
sador Bolton was ‘‘closely monitoring 
what Mr. Giuliani was doing and the 
messaging that he was sending out.’’ 
But Ambassador Bolton was keenly 
aware that Mr. Giuliani was doing the 
President’s bidding. That is also why 
the President fears his testimony. 
During a meeting on June 13, 2019, 
Ambassador Bolton made clear that he 
supported 
more 
engagement 
with 
Ukraine by senior White House offi-
cials but questioned that ‘‘Mr. Giuliani 
was a key voice with the president on 
Ukraine.’’ He joked that every time 
Ukraine is mentioned, Giuliani pops 
up. 
Ambassador 
Bolton 
also 
commu-
nicated directly with Mr. Giuliani at 
key 
junctures. 
According 
to 
call 
records obtained by the House, Mr. 
Giuliani connected with Ambassador 
Bolton’s office three times for brief 
calls between April 23 and May 10, 2019, 
a time period that corresponds with 
the recall of Ambassador Yovanovitch 
and the acceleration of Mr. Giuliani’s 
efforts on behalf of President Trump to 
pressure Ukraine into opening inves-
tigations that would benefit his reelec-
tion campaign. 
For instance, on April 23, the day be-
fore the State Department recalled 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
from 
Ukraine, Mr. Giuliani had an 8-minute 
28-second call from the White House. 
Thirty minutes later, he had a 48-sec-
ond call with a phone number associ-
ated with Ambassador Bolton. 
If he were called to testify, we could 
ask Ambassador Bolton directly what 
transpired on that call and whether 
that phone call informed his assess-
ment that Mr. Giuliani was ‘‘a hand 
grenade that was going to blow every-
one up.’’ We can ask Mr. Bolton why, 
when there are approximately 1.8 mil-
lion companies in Ukraine—several 
hundred thousand of which have been 
accused of corruption—the President 
was focused on only one. He didn’t care 
about anything else. He cared only 
about the company on which the 
former Vice President’s son had been a 
board member. Can you believe that he 
was concerned with corruption and 
only knew about one company, when 
there are hundreds of thousands that 
were accused of corruption? 
Although Ambassador Bolton did not 
listen in on the July 25 call between 
President 
Trump 
and 
President

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S425 
January 21, 2020 
Zelensky in which President Trump 
asked 
the 
Ukrainian 
President 
a 
favor—a favor to investigate one com-
pany and Joe Biden’s son—we have 
learned from witness testimony that 
Ambassador Bolton was opposed to 
scheduling the call in the first place. 
Why? Because he accurately predicted, 
in the words of Ambassador Taylor, 
that ‘‘there could be some talk of in-
vestigations or worse on the call.’’ In 
fact, he did not want the call to happen 
at all because he ‘‘thought it was going 
to be a disaster.’’ 
How did Ambassador Bolton know 
that President Trump would bring this 
up? What made him so concerned that 
a call would be a disaster? I think we 
know, but only Ambassador Bolton can 
answer these questions. 
Based on extensive witness testi-
mony, we also know that throughout 
this period, multiple people on the Na-
tional Security Council’s staff reported 
concerns to Ambassador Bolton about 
tying American foreign policy to Presi-
dent Trump’s ‘‘domestic political er-
rand,’’ as Dr. Hill so aptly put it. 
After he abruptly ended the July 10 
meeting—the meeting in which Ambas-
sador 
Sondland 
abruptly 
told 
the 
Ukrainians that a White House meet-
ing could be scheduled in exchange for 
the announced investigations—Ambas-
sador Bolton spoke to Dr. Hill and di-
rected her to report her concerns to 
National Security Council’s legal ad-
viser John Eisenberg. 
At the end of August, Ambassador 
Bolton advised Ambassador Taylor to 
send a first-person cable to Secretary 
Pompeo to relay concerns about the 
hold on the military aid. 
Ambassador Bolton also advised Mr. 
Morrison—Dr. Hill’s successor as the 
top Russia and Ukraine official on the 
National Security Council—on at least 
two different occasions to report what 
he had heard to the National Security 
Council’s lawyers, it sounding so sus-
picious. 
On September 1, Ambassador Bolton 
directed Mr. Morrison to report to the 
National Security Council’s lawyers an 
explicit 
proposal 
from 
Ambassador 
Sondland to a senior Ukrainian official 
that ‘‘what could help them move the 
aid was if the prosecutor general would 
go to the mike and announce that he 
was opening the Burisma investiga-
tion.’’ 
On September 7, Ambassador Bolton 
instructed Mr. Morrison to report to 
the lawyers another conversation Mr. 
Morrison 
had 
with 
Ambassador 
Sondland. 
This 
time, 
Ambassador 
Sondland had conveyed that the ad-
ministration would not release the 
military aid unless President Zelensky 
announced 
the 
investigations 
de-
manded by President Trump—the in-
vestigations of one company because 
the President was so concerned about 
the corruption in Ukraine. It was one 
company that had had Vice President 
Biden’s son on the board, and the 
President just happened to pick that 
company from hundreds of thousands 
to be concerned about corruption. And 
the President also opposed funding for 
corruption aid to Ukraine. 
Why did Ambassador Bolton tell his 
subordinates to report these issues to 
the national security lawyers? What 
does he know about how the lawyers 
responded to the concerns of Dr. Hill or 
of Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and 
Mr. Morrison? Again, only Ambassador 
Bolton can answer these questions, and 
we must assume that the answers go to 
the heart of the President’s mis-
conduct, given the President’s attempt 
to block his testimony. Why would the 
President oppose the testimony of his 
own appointee as the National Security 
Advisor of the United States unless he 
knew that testimony would be dam-
ming to him? Those are other reasons 
the 
President 
fears 
Ambassador 
Bolton’s testimony. 
I would like to now turn to Ambas-
sador Bolton’s knowledge of and con-
cerns about President Trump’s illegal 
withholding of the military aid to 
Ukraine. 
Of course, we all know that under the 
Anti-Impoundment Act of 1974—passed 
to prevent President Nixon from refus-
ing to spend money appropriated by 
Congress—withholding money appro-
priated by Congress is illegal; nonethe-
less, the President did it for obviously 
corrupt motives. 
By July of last year, Ambassador 
Bolton was well aware that President 
Trump was illegally withholding secu-
rity assistance to Ukraine, and he and 
his subordinates tried to convince the 
President to pursue America’s national 
security interests and release the aid 
instead of continuing to withhold vital 
military assistance to the President— 
instead of holding that vital military 
assistance hostage to the President’s 
personal political agenda. 
Throughout the rest of July, over the 
course of several interagency meetings, 
the National Security Council repeat-
edly discussed the freeze on Ukraine’s 
security assistance. As National Secu-
rity Advisor, Ambassador Bolton su-
pervised that process. These meetings 
worked their way up to the level of 
Cabinet deputies, and every agency in-
volved, except for the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, supported releasing 
the aid. OMB, meanwhile, said its posi-
tion was based on President Trump’s 
express orders. 
We know that a number of individ-
uals at OMB and the Department of De-
fense raised serious concerns about the 
legality of freezing the funds, which we 
know is illegal. We now have an ex-
plicit ruling from the Government Ac-
countability Office, which we didn’t 
need because we knew that is why the 
law was passed in 1974, that the freeze 
ordered by President Trump was ille-
gal—and he was obviously told this— 
and violated the Impoundment Control 
Act. 
We also know that after the meeting 
of Cabinet deputies on July 26, Tim 
Morrison talked to Ambassador Bolton, 
and according to Mr. Morrison, Ambas-
sador Bolton said that the entire Cabi-
net supported releasing the freeze and 
wanted to get the issue to President 
Trump as soon as possible. 
When did Ambassador Bolton first 
become aware that President Trump 
was 
withholding 
military 
aid 
to 
Ukraine and conditioning the release of 
that aid on Ukraine announcing polit-
ical investigations? What was he told 
was the reason? What else did he learn 
about the President’s actions in these 
meetings? 
Again, 
only 
Ambassador 
Bolton can answer these questions, and 
again we must presume that President 
Trump is desperate for us not to hear 
those answers. I hope not too many of 
the Members of this body are desperate 
to make sure that the American people 
don’t hear these same answers. 
We know that Ambassador Bolton 
tried throughout August, without suc-
cess, to persuade the President that 
the aid to Ukraine had to be released 
because that was in America’s best in-
terest and necessary for our national 
security. 
In mid-August, we know Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman wrote a Presidential 
decision memorandum recommending 
that the freeze be lifted based on the 
consensus views of the entire Cabinet. 
The memo was given to Ambassador 
Bolton, who subsequently had a direct, 
one-on-one 
conversation 
with 
the 
President in which he tried but failed 
to convince him to release the hold. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SWALWELL. You said Ambassador 
Bolton had a one-on-one meeting with Presi-
dent Trump in late August 2019, but the 
President was not yet ready to approve the 
release of the assistance. Do you remember 
that? 
Mr. MORRISON. This was 226? 
Mr. SWALWELL. Yes, 266 and 268. But I am 
asking you: Did that happen or did it not? 
Mr. MORRISON. Sir, I just want to be 
clear characterizing it. OK, sir. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Yes. You testified to 
that. What was the outcome of that meeting 
between Ambassador Bolton and President 
Trump? 
Mr. MORRISON. Ambassador Bolton did 
not yet believe the President was ready to 
approve the assistance. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Did Ambassador Bolton 
inform you of any reason for the ongoing 
hold that stemmed from this meeting? 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Ambassador 
Bolton’s efforts failed. By August 30, 
OMB informed DOD that there was 
‘‘clear direction from POTUS to con-
tinue to hold.’’ What rationale did 
President 
Trump 
give 
Ambassador 
Bolton and other senior officials for re-
fusing to release the aid? Were these 
reasons 
convincing 
to 
Ambassador 
Bolton, and did they reflect the best in-
terests of our national security or the 
President’s personal political inter-
ests? 
Only Ambassador Bolton can tell us 
the answers. A fair trial in this body 
would ensure that he testifies. The 
President does not want you to hear 
Ambassador Bolton’s testimony. Why 
is that? For all the obvious reasons I 
have stated. 
The President claims that he froze 
aid to Ukraine in the interest of our

national security. If that is true, why 
would he oppose testimony from his 
own former National Security Advisor? 
Make no mistake. President Trump 
had no legal grounds to block Ambas-
sador Bolton’s testimony in this trial. 
Executive privilege is not a spell that 
the President can cast to cover up evi-
dence of his own misconduct. It is a 
qualified privilege that protects senior 
advisers performing official functions. 
Executive privilege is a shield, not a 
sword. It cannot be used to block a wit-
ness who is willing to testify, as Am-
bassador Bolton says he is. 
As we know from the Nixon case in 
Watergate, the privilege also does not 
prevent us from obtaining specific evi-
dence of wrongdoing. The Supreme 
Court unanimously rejected President 
Nixon’s attempts to use executive 
privilege to conceal incriminating tape 
recordings. All the similar efforts by 
President Trump must also fail. 
The President sometimes relies on a 
theory of absolute immunity that says 
that he can order anybody in the exec-
utive branch not to testify to the 
House or the Senate or to a court. Ob-
viously, this is ridiculous. It has been 
flatly rejected by every Federal court 
to consider the idea. It is embarrassing 
that the President’s counsel would talk 
about this today. 
Again, even if President Trump as-
serts that Ambassador Bolton is abso-
lutely immune from compelled testi-
mony, the President has no authority 
to block Ambassador Bolton from ap-
pearing here. As one court recently ex-
plained, Presidents are not Kings, and 
they do not have subjects whose des-
tiny they are entitled to control. 
This body should not act as if the 
President is a King. We will see, with 
the next vote on this question, whether 
the Members of this body want to pro-
tect the President against all inves-
tigation, against all suspicion, against 
any crimes, or not. 
The Framers of our Constitution 
were most concerned about abuse of 
power where it affects national secu-
rity. President Trump has been im-
peached for placing his political inter-
ests ahead of our national security. It 
is imperative, therefore, that we hear 
from the National Security Advisor 
who witnessed the President’s scheme 
from start to finish. To be clear, the 
record, as it stands, fully supports both 
Articles of Impeachment. It is beyond 
argument 
that 
President 
Trump 
mounted a sustained pressure cam-
paign to get Ukraine to announce in-
vestigations that would benefit him po-
litically and then tried to cover it up. 
The President does not seriously deny 
any of these facts. 
The only question left is this: Why is 
the President so intent on concealing 
the evidence and blocking all docu-
ments and testimony here today? Only 
guilty people try to hide the evidence. 
Of course, all of this is relevant only 
if this here today is a fair trial, only if 
you, the Senate, sitting as an impartial 
jury, do not work with the accused to 
conceal the evidence from the Amer-
ican people. 
We cannot be surprised that the 
President objects to calling witnesses 
who would prove his guilt. That is who 
he is. He does not want you to see evi-
dence or hear testimony that details 
how he betrayed his office and asked a 
foreign government to intervene in our 
election. But we should be surprised 
that, here in the U.S. Senate, the 
greatest deliberative body in the world, 
where we are expected to put our oath 
of office ahead of political expediency, 
where we are expected to be honest, 
where we are expected to protect the 
interests of the American people—we 
should be surprised, shocked—that any 
Senator would vote to block this wit-
ness or any relevant witness who might 
shed additional light on the President’s 
obvious misconduct. 
The President is on trial in the Sen-
ate, but the Senate is on trial in the 
eyes of the American people. Will you 
vote to allow all of the relevant evi-
dence to be presented here, or will you 
betray your pledge to be an impartial 
juror? Will you bring Ambassador 
Bolton here? Will you permit us to 
present you with the entire record of 
the President’s misconduct, or will 
you, instead, choose to be complicit in 
the President’s coverup? 
So far, I am sad to say, I see a lot of 
Senators voting for a coverup, voting 
to deny witnesses—an absolutely inde-
fensible vote, obviously a treacherous 
vote, a vote against an honest consid-
eration of the evidence against the 
President, a vote against an honest 
trial, a vote against the United States. 
A real trial, we know, has witnesses. 
We urge you to do your duty, permit a 
fair trial. All the witnesses must be 
permitted. 
That 
is 
elementary 
in 
American justice. Either you want the 
truth and you must permit the wit-
nesses, or you want a shameful cover-
up. History will judge. So will the elec-
torate. 
Mr. Chief Justice, we reserve the bal-
ance of our time—the managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, we 
came here today to address the false 
case brought to you by the House man-
agers. We have been respectful of the 
Senate. We have made our arguments 
to you. 
You don’t deserve and we don’t de-
serve what just happened. Mr. NADLER 
came up here and made false allega-
tions against our team. He made false 
allegations against all of you. He ac-
cused you of a coverup. He has been 
making false allegations against the 
President. The only one who should be 
embarrassed, Mr. NADLER, is you, for 
the way you have addressed this body. 
This is the U.S. Senate. You are not in 
charge here. 
Now let me address the issue of Mr. 
Bolton. I have addressed it before. 
They don’t tell you that they didn’t 
bother to call Mr. Bolton themselves. 
They didn’t subpoena him. Mr. COOPER 
wrote them a letter. He said very clear-
ly: If the House chooses not to pursue 
through subpoena the testimony of Dr. 
Kupperman and Ambassador Bolton, 
let the record be clear. That is the 
House’s decision. 
They 
didn’t 
pursue 
Ambassador 
Bolton, and they withdrew the sub-
poena to Mr. Kupperman. So, for them 
to come here now and demand that, be-
fore we even start the arguments—they 
ask you to do something that they 
refuse to do for themselves and then 
accuse you of a coverup when you don’t 
do it—it is ridiculous. Talk about out- 
of-control governing. 
Now, let me read you a quote from 
Mr. NADLER not so long ago: 
The effect of impeachment is to overturn 
the popular will of the voters. There must 
never be a narrowly voted impeachment or 
an impeachment supported by one of our 
major political parties and opposed by the 
other. Such an impeachment would produce 
divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for 
years to come and will call into question the 
very legitimacy of our political institutions. 
Well, you have just seen it for your-
self. What happened, Mr. NADLER? 
What happened? 
The American people pay their sala-
ries, and they are here to take away 
their vote. They are here to take away 
their voice. They have come here, and 
they have attacked every institution of 
our government. They have attacked 
the President, the executive branch. 
They 
have 
attacked 
the 
judicial 
branch. They say they don’t have time 
for courts. They have attacked the U.S. 
Senate, repeatedly. It is about time we 
bring this power trip in for a landing. 
President Trump is a man of his 
word. He made promises to the Amer-
ican people, and he delivered—over and 
over and over again. And they come 
here and say, with no evidence, spend-
ing the day complaining, that they 
can’t make their case, attacking a res-
olution that had 100 percent support in 
this body. And some of the people here 
supported it at the time. It is a farce, 
and it should end. 
Mr. NADLER, you owe an apology to 
the President of the United States and 
his family. You owe an apology to the 
Senate. But, most of all, you owe an 
apology to the American people. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the remain-
der of my time to Mr. Sekulow. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, chair-
man NADLER talked about treacherous, 
and at about 12:10 a.m., January 22, the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
in this body, on the floor of this Sen-
ate, said ‘‘executive privilege and other 
nonsense.’’ Now, think about that for a 
moment—‘‘executive 
privilege 
and 
other nonsense.’’ 
Mr. NADLER, it is not nonsense. These 
are privileges recognized by the Su-
preme Court of the United States. To 
shred the Constitution on the floor of 
the Senate—to serve what purpose? 
The Senate is not on trial. The Con-
stitution doesn’t allow what just took 
place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S427 
January 21, 2020 
Look at what we have dealt with for 
the last now 13 hours. We, hopefully, 
are closing the proceedings, but not on 
a very high note. 
Only guilty people try to hide evi-
dence? So, I guess, when President 
Obama instructed his Attorney General 
to not give information, he was guilty 
of a crime. That is the way it works, 
Mr. NADLER? Is that the way you view 
the U.S. Constitution? Because that is 
not the way it was written. That is not 
the way it is interpreted, and that is 
not the way the American people 
should have to live. 
I will tell you what is treacherous: 
To come to the floor of the Senate and 
say ‘‘executive privilege and other non-
sense.’’ 
Mr. Chief Justice, we yield the rest of 
our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The managers 
have 27 minutes remaining. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, the 
President’s counsel has no standing to 
talk about lying. He told this body 
today—the President has told this 
body—and told the American people re-
peatedly, for example, that the House 
of Representatives refused to allow the 
President due process. I told you that 
it is available—public document, No-
vember 26 letter from me, as chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee, to the 
President, offering him due process, of-
fering witnesses, offering cross-exam-
ination. 
A few days later, we received a letter 
from Mr. Cipollone on White House sta-
tionery that said: No, we have no inter-
est in appearing. 
On the one hand, the House is con-
demned by the President for not giving 
him due process after they rejected the 
offer of due process. That letter reject-
ing it was December 1. 
The President’s counsel says that the 
House should have issued subpoenas. 
We did issue subpoenas. The President, 
you may recall—you should recall— 
said he would oppose all subpoenas, and 
he did. So many of those subpoenas are 
still being fought in court—subpoenas 
issued last April. So that is also un-
true. It takes a heck of a lot of nerve 
to criticize the House for not issuing 
subpoenas when the President said he 
would oppose all subpoenas. We have 
issued a lot of subpoenas. He opposes 
all of them, and they are tied up in 
court. 
The 
President 
claims—and 
most 
Members of this body know better, ex-
ecutive privilege, which is a limited 
privilege, which exists but not as a 
shield, not as a shield against wrong-
doing, as the Supreme Court specifi-
cally said in the Nixon case in 1974. The 
President claims absolute immunity. 
Mr. Cipollone wrote some of those let-
ters, not only saying the President but 
that nobody should testify that he 
doesn’t want, and then they have the 
nerve—and that is a violation of the 
constitutional rights of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate and of 
the 
American 
people 
represented 
through them. 
It is an assertion of the kingly pre-
rogative, a monarchical prerogative. 
Only the President—only the President 
has rights, and the people as rep-
resented in Congress cannot get infor-
mation from the executive branch at 
all. This body has committees. It has a 
200-year record of issuing subpoenas, of 
having the administration of the day 
testify, of sometimes having subpoena 
fights, but no President has ever 
claimed the right to stonewall Con-
gress on everything, period. Congress 
has no right to get information. The 
American people have no right to get 
information. That, in fact, is article II 
of the impeachment that we have 
voted. 
It is beyond belief that the President 
claims monarchical powers—I can do 
whatever I want under article II, says 
he—and then acts on that, defies every-
thing, defies the law to withhold aid 
from Ukraine, defies the law in a dozen 
different directions all the time, and 
lies about it all the time and says to 
Mr. Cipollone to lie about it. These 
facts are undeniable—undeniable. 
I reserve. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Cipollone, 
once again, complained that we did not 
request John Bolton to testify in the 
House, but of course we did. We did re-
quest his testimony, and he was a no- 
show. 
When we talked to his counsel about 
subpoenaing his testimony, the answer 
was: You give us a subpoena, and we 
will sue you. And, indeed, that is what 
Mr. Bolton’s attorney did with the sub-
poena for Dr. Kupperman. 
There was no willingness by Mr. 
Bolton to testify before the House. He 
said he would sue us. What is the prob-
lem with his suing us? Their Justice 
Department, under Bill Barr, is in 
court arguing—actually in that very 
case involving Dr. Kupperman—that 
Dr. Kupperman can’t sue the adminis-
tration and the Congress. 
That is the same position that Con-
gress has taken, the same position the 
administration is taking but, appar-
ently, not the same position these law-
yers are taking. 
Here is the bigger problem with that. 
We subpoenaed Don McGahn, as I told 
you earlier. You should know we sub-
poenaed Don McGahn in April of 2019. 
It is January of 2020. We still don’t 
have a final decision from the court re-
quiring him to testify. In a couple of 
months, it will be 1 year since we 
issued that subpoena. 
The President would like nothing 
more than for us to have to go through 
1 year or 2 years or 3 years of litigation 
to get any witness to come before the 
House. The problem is, the President is 
trying to cheat in this election. We 
don’t have the luxury of waiting 1 year 
or 2 years or 3 years, when the very ob-
ject of this scheme was to cheat in the 
next election. It is not like that threat 
has gone away. 
Just last month, the President’s law-
yer was in Ukraine still trying to 
smear his opponent and still trying to 
get Ukraine to interfere in our elec-
tion. The President said, even while 
the impeachment investigation was 
going on, when he was asked: What did 
you want in that call with Zelensky, 
and his answer was: Well, if we are 
being honest about it, Zelensky should 
do that investigation of the Bidens. 
He hasn’t stopped asking them to 
interfere. Do you think the Ukrainians 
have any doubt about what he wants? 
One of the witnesses, David Holmes, 
testified 
about 
the 
pressure 
that 
Ukraine feels. He made a very impor-
tant point: It isn’t over. It is not like 
they don’t want anything else from the 
United States. 
This effort to pressure Ukraine goes 
on to this day, with the President’s 
lawyer continuing the scheme, as we 
speak, with the President inviting 
other nations to also involve them-
selves in our election. 
China—he wants to now investigate 
the Bidens. This is no intangible threat 
to our elections. Within the last couple 
of weeks, it has been reported that the 
Russians have tried to hack Burisma. 
Why do you think they are hacking 
Burisma? Because, as Chairman NAD-
LER says, everybody seems to be inter-
ested in this one company out of hun-
dreds of thousands Ukrainian compa-
nies. It is a coincidence that the same 
company that the President has been 
trying to smear Joe Biden over hap-
pens to be the company the Russians 
are hacking. 
Why would the Russians do that? If 
you look back to the last election, the 
Russians hacked the DNC, and they 
started to leak campaign documents in 
a drip, drip, drip, and the President was 
only too happy—over 100 times in the 
last couple of months in the cam-
paign—to cite those Russian-hacked 
Russian documents, and now the Rus-
sians are at it again. 
This is no illusory threat to the inde-
pendence of our elections. The Rus-
sians are at it, as we speak. What does 
the President do? Is he saying: Back 
off, Russia; I am not interested in your 
help; I don’t want foreign interference? 
No, he is saying: Come on in, China. He 
has his guy in Ukraine continuing the 
scheme. 
We can’t wait a year or 2 years or 3 
years, like we have had to wait with 
Don McGahn, to get John Bolton in to 
testify to let you know that this threat 
is ongoing. 
Counsel also says: Well, this is just 
like Obama, right? This is just like 
Obama, citing, I suppose, the Fast and 
Furious case. They don’t mention to 
you that in that investigation, the 
Obama administration turned over tens 
of thousands of documents. They don’t 
want you to know about that. They say 
it is just like Obama. 
When you find video of Barack 
Obama saying that under article II he 
can do anything, then you can compare 
Barack Obama to Donald Trump. When 
you find a video of Barack Obama say-
ing: I am going to fight all subpoenas, 
then you can compare Barack Obama 
to Donald Trump.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S428 
January 21, 2020 
And 
finally, 
Mr. 
Cipollone 
says, 
President Trump is a man of his word. 
It is too late in the evening for me to 
go into that one, except to say this. 
President Trump gave his word he 
would drain the swamp. He said he 
would drain the swamp. What have we 
seen? We have seen his personal lawyer 
go to jail, his campaign chairman go to 
jail, his deputy campaign chairman 
convicted of a different crime, his asso-
ciates’ associate, Lev Parnas, under in-
dictment. The list goes and on. That is, 
I guess, how you drain the swamp. You 
have all your people go to jail. 
I don’t think that is really what was 
meant by that expression. For the pur-
poses of why we are here today, how 
does someone who promises to drain 
the swamp coerce an ally of ours into 
doing a political investigation? That is 
the swamp. That is not draining the 
swamp; that is exporting the swamp. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. I think it is 
appropriate at this point for me to ad-
monish both the House managers and 
the President’s counsel in equal terms 
to remember that they are addressing 
the world’s greatest deliberative body. 
One reason it has earned that title is 
because its Members avoid speaking in 
a manner and using language that is 
not conducive to civil discourse. 
In the 1905 Swayne trial, a Senator 
objected when one of the managers 
used the word ‘‘pettifogging,’’ and the 
Presiding Officer said the word ought 
not have been used. I don’t think we 
need to aspire to that high a standard, 
but I think those addressing the Senate 
should remember where they are. 
The majority leader is recognized.

The motion to table is agreed to; the

The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Demo-
cratic leader is recognized. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1292 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. 
I send an amendment to the desk to 
provide for a vote of the Senate on any 
motion to subpoena witnesses or docu-
ments after the question period, and I 
waive its reading. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there any 
objection to the waiving of the read-
ing? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. I object. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I withdraw my re-
quest for a waiver. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Does any Sen-
ator have an objection to the waiving 
of the reading? 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I object. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
read the amendment. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHUMER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1292. 
On page 3, line 8, strike ‘‘4 hours’’ and in-
sert ‘‘2 hours’’. 
On page 3, line 10, strike ‘‘the question of’’ 
and all that follows through ‘‘rules’’ on line 
12. 
On page 3, line 14, insert ‘‘any such mo-
tion’’ after ‘‘decide’’. 
On page 3, line 15, strike ‘‘whether’’ and all 
that follows through ‘‘documents’’ on line 17. 
On page 3, line 18, strike ‘‘that question’’ 
and insert ‘‘any such motion’’. 
On page 3, lines 23 and 24 strike ‘‘and the 
Senate shall decide after deposition which 
witnesses shall testify’’ and insert ‘‘and then 
shall testify in the Senate’’. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amend-
ment is arguable by the parties for 2 
hours, equally divided. 
Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a pro-
ponent or opponent? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Proponent. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. We oppose 
it. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
you may proceed and reserve time for 
rebuttal. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, this 
amendment 
makes 
two 
important 
changes to the McConnell resolution. 
The first is, the McConnell resolution 
does not actually provide for an imme-
diate vote even later on the witnesses 
we have requested. 
What the McConnell resolution says 
is that at some point after, essentially, 
the trial is over—after you have had 
the arguments of both sides and you 
have had the 16 hours of questioning— 
then there will be a debate as to wheth-
er to have a vote and a debate on a par-
ticular witness. There is no guarantee 
that you are going to get a chance to 
vote on specific witnesses. 
All the resolution provides is that 
you are going to get an opportunity to 
vote to have a debate on whether to ul-
timately have a vote on a particular 
witness. This would strip that middle 
layer. It would strip the debate on 
whether to have a debate on a par-
ticular witness. 
If my counsel, my colleagues for the 
President’s team, are making the point 
that ‘‘Well, you are going to get that 
opportunity later,’’ the reality is that 
under the McConnell resolution, we 
may never get to have a debate about 
particular witnesses. 
You heard the discussion of four wit-
nesses tonight. There may be others 
who come to the attention of this body 
who are able to get documents that we 
should also call. But will you ever get 
to hear a debate about why a par-
ticular witness is necessary? Well, you 
may only get a debate over the debate. 
This amendment would remove that 
debate 
over 
debate 
regarding 
par-
ticular witnesses. 
The other thing this resolution would 
provide is that you should hear from 
these witnesses directly. The McCon-
nell resolution says that we deposed, 
and that is it. It doesn’t say you are 
ever going to actually hear these wit-
nesses for yourself, which means that 
you, as the triers of fact, may not get 
to see and witness the credibility of 
these witnesses. You may only get to 
see a deposition or deposition tran-
script or maybe a video of a deposition. 
I don’t know. But if there is any con-
testing of facts, wouldn’t you like to 
hear from the witnesses yourself and 
very directly? 
Now, the reason why it was done this 
way in the Clinton case and why there 
were depositions—and again, in the 
Clinton case, all these people had been 
interviewed and deposed or testified be-
fore. The reason it was done that way 
in the Clinton case is because of the sa-
lacious nature of the testimony. No-
body wanted witnesses on the Senate 
floor talking about sex. Well, as I said 
earlier, I can assure you that will not 
be the issue here. 
To whatever degree there was a re-
luctance in the Clinton case to have 
live testimony because of its salacious 
character, that is not an issue here. 
That is not a reason here not to hear 
from those witnesses yourself. 
This resolution makes those two im-
portant changes, and I would urge your 
support. 
I reserve time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
Mr. Purpura will argue this motion. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, good 
morning. I will be very brief on this. 
We strongly oppose the amendment. 
We support the resolution as written. 
We believe, as to the two areas that 
Manager Schiff discussed, the resolu-
tion 
appropriately 
considers 
those

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

January 21, 2020 
questions and strikes the impeachment 
balance in the Senate’s discretion as 
the sole trier of impeachments. 
The rules in place here in the resolu-
tion are similar to the Clinton pro-
ceeding in that regard in the sense that 
this body has the discretion as to 
whether to hear from the witness live, 
if there are witnesses at some point, or 
not. 
But, more fundamentally, the pre-
liminary question has to be overcome, 
which is there will be 4 hours total, 
with 2 hours for them to try to con-
vince you, after the parties have made 
their presentation—which they will 
have 24 hours to do—as to the prelimi-
nary question of whether it shall be in 
order to consider and debate any mo-
tion to subpoena witnesses or docu-
ments. 
Those were precisely the Clinton 
rules—actually, stronger than the Clin-
ton rules. Those rules, as I have indi-
cated before, passed 100 to 0. We think 
that the resolution strikes the appro-
priate balance, and we urge that the 
amendment be rejected. 
I yield my time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. SCHIFF, you have 57 minutes. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Don’t worry. I 
won’t use it. 
I will say only that if there were any 
veneer left to camouflage where the 
President’s counsel is really coming 
from, the veneer is completely gone 
now. After saying we are going to have 
an opportunity to have a vote on these 
witnesses later, now they are saying: 
No, you are just going to have a vote 
on whether to debate having a vote on 
the witnesses. 
The camouflage was pretty thin to 
begin with, but it is completely gone 
now. 
What they really want is to get to 
that generic debate about whether or 
not to have a debate on witnesses and 
have you vote it down so you never ac-
tually have to vote to refuse these wit-
nesses, although you had to do that to-
night. I don’t see what purpose that 
serves except, I suppose, to put one 
more layer in the way of account-
ability. 
But the veneer is gone. All this prom-
ise about ‘‘You are going to get that 
opportunity, it is just a question of 
when’’—no, the whole goal is for you to 
never get the chance to take that vote. 
And what is more, the vote on this res-
olution is a vote that says that you 
don’t want to hear from these wit-
nesses yourself. You don’t want to 
evaluate the credibility of these wit-
nesses yourself. Maybe—just maybe— 
you will let them be deposed, but you 
don’t want to hear them yourself. You 
don’t want to see these witnesses put 
up their hand and take an oath. 
I don’t know what the rules of these 
depositions are going to be. Maybe the 
public isn’t going to ever get to see 
what happens in those depositions. We 
released all the deposition transcripts 
from our depositions—the secret 100- 
person depositions—but we have no 
idea what rules they will adopt for 
these depositions. Maybe the public 
will see them; maybe they won’t. 
Maybe you will get to see them; I as-
sume you will get to see them. But at 
the end of the day, this is also a vote 
you have to cast that says: No, I don’t 
want to hear them for myself. No, I 
don’t want to evaluate their credibility 
for myself. 
This is, after all, only a vote, only a 
case, only a trial about the impeach-
ment of the President of the United 
States. If you have a bank robbery 
trial or you have a trial where some-
body is stealing a piece of mail, you 
could get live witnesses. But to im-
peach the President of the United 
States, they are saying: No, we don’t 
need to see their credibility. 
Is that really where we are here to-
night? Is that what the American peo-
ple expect of a fair trial? I don’t think 
it is. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized.

cratic leader is recognized. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1293 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send an amendment to the desk to 
allow adequate time for written re-
sponses to any motions by the parties, 
and I ask that it be read. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
read the amendment. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHUMER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1293. 
On page 2, beginning on line 10, strike 
‘‘11:00 a.m. on Wednesday, January 22, 2020’’ 
and insert ‘‘9:00 a.m. on Thursday, January 
23, 2020’’. 
On page 2, line 15, strike ‘‘Wednesday, Jan-
uary 22, 2020’’ and insert ‘‘Thursday, January 
23, 2020’’. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amend-
ment is arguable by the parties for 2 
hours, equally divided. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF, are you a pro-
ponent of this amendment? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I am a proponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, 
are you a proponent or an opponent of 
this amendment? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, I am an opponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Okay. 
Mr. SCHIFF, you may proceed and re-
serve time for rebuttal if you wish. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
This amendment is quite simple. 
Under the McConnell resolution, the 
parties file motions tomorrow at 9 
a.m.—written motions, that is—and 
the responding party has to file their 
reply 2 hours later. That really doesn’t 
give anybody enough time to respond 
to a written motion. 
When the President’s team filed, for 
example, their trial brief, it was over 
100 pages. We at least had 24 hours to 
file our reply, and that is all we would 
ask for. In the Clinton trial—again, if 
we are interested in the Clinton case— 
they had 41 hours to respond to written 
motions. We are not asking for 41 
hours, but we are asking for enough 
time to write a decent response to a 
motion. 
That is essentially it, and I would 
hope that we could agree at least on 
this. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the 
Senate. 
So it seems like tomorrow is a day 
off according to your procedure; is that 
correct, Mr. SCHIFF? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I forgot the 
time. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Today is to-
morrow, and tomorrow is today. The 
answer is that we are ready to proceed. 
We will respond to any motions. We 
would ask the Chamber to reject this 
amendment. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
there are 59 minutes remaining. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I yield back 
our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized.

The motion to table is agreed to; the 
amendment is tabled. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Demo-
cratic leader is recognized. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1294 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, on 
behalf of Senator VAN HOLLEN, I send 
an amendment to the desk to help en-
sure impartial justice by requiring the 
Chief Justice of the United States to 
rule on motions to subpoena witnesses 
and documents. I ask that it be read. 
This is our last amendment of the 
evening. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
read the amendment. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHU-
MER], for Mr. VAN
HOLLEN, proposes an 
amendment numbered 1294. 
On page 3, line 20, insert ‘‘The Presiding 
Officer shall rule to authorize the subpoena 
of any witness or any document that a Sen-
ator or a party moves to subpoena if the Pre-
siding Officer determines that the witness or 
document is likely to have probative evi-
dence relevant to either article of impeach-
ment before the Senate.’’ after ‘‘order.’’. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amend-
ment is arguable by the parties for 2 
hours, equally divided. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF, are you a pro-
ponent or an opponent of the motion? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I am a proponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, 
are you a proponent or an opponent of 
the motion? 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, I am an opponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
you may proceed and reserve time for 
rebuttal. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, this 
amendment would provide that the 
Presiding Officer shall rule to author-
ize the subpoena of any witness or any 
document that a Senator or a party 
moves to subpoena if the Presiding Of-
ficer determines that that witness is 
likely to have probative evidence rel-
evant to either Article of Impeach-
ment. 
It is quite simple. It would allow the 
Chief Justice and it would allow Sen-
ators, the House managers, and the 
President’s counsel to make use of the 
experience of the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court to decide the questions 
of the relevance of witnesses. Either 
party can call the witnesses, and if we 
can’t come to an agreement on wit-
nesses ourselves, we will pick a neutral 
arbiter, that being the Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court. If the Chief Justice 
finds that a witness would be pro-
bative, that witness would be allowed 
to testify. If the Chief Justice finds the 
testimony would be immaterial, that 
witness would not be allowed to tes-
tify. 
Now, it still maintains the Senate’s 
tradition that if you don’t agree with 
the Chief Justice, you can overrule 
him. If you have the votes, you can 
overrule the Chief Justice and say you 
disagree with what the Chief Justice 
has decided. 
But it would give this decision to a 
neutral party. That right is extended 
to both parties, who will be done in 
line with the schedule that the major-
ity leader has set out. It is not the 
schedule we want. We still don’t think 
it makes any sense to have the trial 
and then decide our witnesses. But if 
we are going to have to do it that way, 
and it looks like we are, at least let’s 
have a neutral arbiter decide—much as 
he may loathe the task—whether a wit-
ness is relevant or a witness is not. 
We would hope that if there is noth-
ing else we can agree on tonight, that 
we could agree to allow the Chief Jus-
tice to give us the benefit of his experi-
ence in deciding which witnesses are 
relevant to this inquiry and which wit-
nesses are not. 
With that, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, and 
with no disrespect to the Chief Justice, 
this is not an appellate court. This is 
the U.S. Senate. There is not an arbi-
tration clause in the U.S. Constitution. 
The Senate shall have the sole power 
to try all impeachments. We oppose the 
amendment. 
We yield our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
you have 57 minutes remaining. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, this is a 
good note to conclude on because don’t 
let it be said we haven’t made progress 
today. 
The President’s counsel has just ac-
knowledged for the first time that this 
is not an appellate court. I am glad we 
have established that. This is the trial, 
not the appeal, and the trial ought to 
have witnesses and the trial should be 
based on the cold record from the court 
below, but there is no court below, be-
cause, as the counsel has just admit-
ted, you are not the appellate court. 
But I think what we have also seen 
here tonight is, they not only don’t 
want you to hear these witnesses, they 
don’t want to hear them live. They 
don’t want even really to hear them de-
posed. They don’t want a neutral Jus-
tice to weigh in because if the neutral 
Justice weighs in and says: You know, 
pretty hard to argue that John Bolton 
is not relevant here, pretty hard to 
argue that Mick Mulvaney is not rel-
evant here—I just watched that video-
tape where he said he discussed this 
with the President. They are con-
testing it. Pretty relevant. 
What about Hunter Biden? Hunter 
Biden is probably the real reason they 
don’t want the Chief Justice to have to 
rule on the materiality of a witness, 
right? What can Hunter Biden tell us 
about why the President withheld hun-
dreds of millions of dollars from 
Ukraine? I can tell you what he can 
tell us—nothing. What does Hunter 
Biden know about why the President 
wouldn’t 
meet 
with 
President 
Zelensky? He can’t tell us anything 
about that. What can he tell us about 
these Defense Department documents 
or OMB documents? What can he tell 
us about the violation of the law, with-
holding this money? Of course he can’t 
tell us anything about that because his 
testimony is immaterial and irrele-
vant. The only purpose in calling him 
is to succeed at what they failed to do 
earlier in this whole scheme, and that 
is to smear Joe Biden by going after 
his son. 
We trust the Chief Justice of the Su-
preme Court to make that decision 
that he is not a material witness. This 
isn’t like fantasy football here. We are 
not making trades—or we shouldn’t be. 
We will trade you one completely irrel-
evant, immaterial witness who allows 
us to smear the President’s opponent 
in exchange for ones who are really rel-
evant whom you should hear. Is that a 
fair trial? 
If you can’t trust the Chief Justice, 
appointed by a Republican President, 
to make a fair decision about materi-
ality, I think it betrays the weakness 
of your case. 
Look, I will be honest. There has 
been some apprehension on our side 
about this idea, but we have confidence 
that the Chief Justice would make a 
fair and impartial decision and that he 
would do impartial justice, and it is 
something that my colleagues rep-
resenting the President don’t. They 
don’t. They don’t want a fair judicial

ruling about this. They don’t want one 
that you could overturn because they 
don’t want a fair trial. 
And so we end where we started— 
with one party wanting a fair trial and 
one party that doesn’t; one party that 
doesn’t fear a fair trial and one party 
that is terrified of a fair trial. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized.

MORNING BUSINESS 
CELEBRATION OF LIFE DAY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Jan-
uary 22 is celebration of life day, and I 
wanted to take that opportunity to 
recognize 
women 
facing 
unplanned 
pregnancies or parenting young chil-
dren. Women with unplanned preg-
nancies sometimes lack access to ad-
vice and support. They deserve the 
backing of their community and access 
to information, resources, and quality 
care. In Iowa, programs like Ruth Har-
bor in Des Moines provide a safe place 
for young women, giving them coun-
seling, education support, life-skills 
training, parenting training, adoption 
assistance, and access to health care at 
no cost. Programs like these are crit-
ical. 
f 
47TH ANNUAL MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Fri-
day marks the 47th annual March for 
Life. This year’s theme is ‘‘Life Em-
powers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman.’’ This 
theme recognizes that 2020 is the cen-
tennial anniversary of the 19th amend-
ment. The earliest feminists regarded 
abortion as a terrible consequence of 
our society’s failure to embrace wom-
en’s intrinsic value. These women in-
stinctively embraced the sanctity of 
innocent human life, even though they 
could not have foreseen the advances in 
technology that have made it possible 
for newborn babies to survive at earlier 
and earlier stages of fetal development. 
Two examples of such miracle babies 
are Micah Pickering of Iowa, born pre-
maturely at 22 weeks gestation, who is 
now 7 years old, and Jaden Wesley Mor-
row, born at 23 weeks gestation, who 
died a few weeks after his birth in Des 
Moines last year. We today celebrate 
the lives of these miracle babies, re-
member all the others who were lost to 
abortion, and focus on how women are 
empowered by upholding the dignity of 
life. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
today the Senate begins in earnest our 
efforts to determine if our colleagues 
in the House of Representatives have 
compiled sufficient evidence to justify 
removing a sitting President from of-
fice. This is no small task, and it will 
be made more difficult by the swirl of 
commentary that has engulfed the im-
peachment inquiry since well before it 
was officially initiated. 
Much has been made of our debate 
over the inclusion of additional witness 
testimony into the prosecution’s case 
against 
President 
Donald 
John 
Trump—so much, in fact, that many of 
my colleagues are inclined to allow 
that testimony in the name of bipar-
tisan compromise. How misguided of 
them. Such a move would open the 
floodgates to a parade of politically- 
motivated 
testimony, 
a 
protracted 
legal battle, and ultimately unjustified 
impeachment proceedings in the U.S. 
Senate. 
The Democratic Members of the 
House of Representatives spent a great 
deal of their time and energy holding 
hearings, interviewing witnesses, and 
putting together what they have in-
sisted is their best, ironclad case 
against President Trump. I encourage 
my colleagues to resist allowing an ad-
ditional, cathartic airing of grievances 
and instead accept that it is now the 
Senate’s turn to listen to the facts as 
they are presented, deliberate, and cast 
a final vote.

TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES 
NARAMORE 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today

friend, 
Dr. 
Jim

remembered for his excellence in med-
ical care and helping out in the com-
munity. 
I know Dr. Naramore not only as a 
leader in my hometown of Gillette but 
also as my personal doctor. About 25 
years ago, I wasn’t feeling well and 
went to see Dr. Naramore. He ran some 
tests and soon discovered that I had a 
torn heart valve. By that night, I was 
in open heart surgery to repair my 
heart valve, and it has served me well 
since. I credit Dr. Naramore with sav-
ing my life. 
Dr. Naramore has spent his entire ca-
reer helping people and giving back to 
the community. Born and raised in Gil-
lette, WY, Dr. Naramore received his 
bachelor’s degree from John Brown 
University, his medical degree from 
the University of Utah, and completed 
a family practice residency at the Uni-
versity of Nebraska affiliated hos-
pitals. 
After 
his 
residency, 
Dr. 
Naramore returned to Gillette to work 
in the emergency room at the Camp-
bell County Memorial Hospital. 
In 1980, Dr. Naramore began his prac-
tice and became a full-time member of 
the medical staff of Campbell County 
Memorial Hospital. In 1981, he moved 
to private practice at Family Health in 
Gillette. His family health clinic has 
provided excellent care to residents of 
Gillette for years and has attracted 
much needed providers and specialists 
to the area. 
Dr. Naramore has served in countless 
leadership positions both in Gillette 
and around Wyoming. He has received 
many awards for his hard work and 
outstanding achievements, most re-
cently receiving the 2019 Outstanding 
Healthcare Award. Dr. Naramore is a 
committed man of faith. He is actively 
involved in his church, serving as an 
elder, deacon, worship leader, and Sun-
day school teacher. 
The University of Wyoming has a slo-
gan saying that the world needs more 
cowboys. Well, I would also say that 
Wyoming needs more doctors, espe-
cially doctors like Dr. Naramore. If his 
past is any indication of his future, I 
think it is clear that he will be closing 
the door on this great chapter of his 
life and moving on to something new. 
Whatever that may prove to be, I am 
certain it will make good use of his 
abilities, background, and experience. 
Diana joins in sending our best wishes 
to Dr. Naramore and his family. We 
thank him for his hard work and dedi-
cation to his patients and community 
throughout his career.

REMEMBERING RICHARD ‘‘RICK’’ 
GRAHAM HILL 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Mr. Richard ‘‘Rick’’ Graham Hill, re-
vered leader of the Oneida Nation of 
Wisconsin, whose tireless work on be-
half of all Native peoples will be hon-
ored, admired, and emulated for gen-
erations to come. 
Rick’s work and accomplishments 
throughout his lifelong dedication to 
Tribal service were as dynamic as Rick 
himself. Grandson of Dr. Lillie Rosa 
Minoka-Hill—only the second indige-
nous female doctor in America—Rick 
was destined to live an exceptional life. 
Early on, Rick proved to be an elite 
athlete, earning the title of West De 
Pere High School Athlete of the Year 
in 1971. In keeping with Wisconsin tra-
dition, his favorite sport was football. 
He would later serve as executive pro-
ducer of a film still in production, enti-
tled ‘‘Bright Path: The Story of Jim 
Thorpe,’’ honoring the NFL Hall-of- 
Famer and America’s first Native ath-
lete to win an Olympic Gold Medal. His 
natural strength and enduring achieve-
ments in athletic competition were 
precursors to the successes that would 
eventually define his true legacy: his 
tireless, unbeatable, loving dedication 
to the advancement of Native commu-
nities. 
At age 23, influenced by his time 
spent attending Tribal meetings with 
his father, Rick became the youngest 
person to serve on Oneida’s Tribal 
Council. He would serve two terms as 
chairman of the Oneida Nation, from 
1990 to 1993 and from 2008 to 2011. His 
first term brought the first gaming 
compact between the Oneida Nation 
and the State of Wisconsin, a major 
milestone that would reshape the eco-
nomic future of the Oneida. Gaming to 
Rick was more than a business venture 
or a path to profit—the advancement of 
gaming was the continuation of the 
fight for the sovereignty, empower-
ment, and advancement of all Native 
peoples from coast to coast. Gaming 
brought revenue for healthcare, em-
ployment, education, and a host of 
other basic services crucial to inde-
pendence. 
Not surprisingly, in 1993, while still 
serving as chairman of the Oneida Na-
tion, Rick became chairman of the Na-
tional 
Indian 
Gaming 
Association, 
NIGA, a position he would hold until 
2001. Rick flourished in this role: he 
rallied and unified other Native Tribes 
to the cause, tirelessly traveling to 
promote Indian gaming both inside the 
courtroom and in discussions with Gov-
ernors and U.S. Senators. 
Even outside of his official service in 
the Oneida Nation and the NIGA, 
Rick’s entrepreneurial efforts to lift up 
and diversify Native economies made 
history. His unique ability to unify 
Tribes in pursuit of common goals was 
best exemplified by the creation of 
Four Fires, LLC. This four-Tribe part-
nership, the first inter-Tribal economic 
undertaking of its kind in history, cul-
minated in the creation of a $43 million 
development located a short walk from 
our Nation’s Capitol and only three 
blocks from the Smithsonian National 
Museum of the American Indian. This 
is the first Tribally owned enterprise in 
Washington, DC. 
Rick’s memory will be kept alive by 
his 
three 
sons, 
Richard 
Graham 
Lo’nikuhliyo’stu, Jr., aka Lotni; Sage 
McKinney Lolihwaka´.te Hill; and Da-
kota Grahame Tehokahtlu’.ni Hill, as 
well as the countless many whose lives 
he touched in immeasurable ways. To 
all who knew him, Rick will be remem-
bered as a visionary, full of brilliance 
and fortitude, with the resolve pos-
sessed by the few, true champions of 
our times. He will also be remembered 
as a calm, quiet presence, generous 
with his laughter and jokes, with a 
heart full of devotion to those he 
served. I will be forever grateful that 
Rick’s legacy will live on in the pride 
of the Native peoples he championed 
and forever honored to call him my 
friend.

REMEMBERING RONALD ‘‘RON’’ 
McCREA 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a distinguished citizen 
of Wisconsin, Ronald Alan McCrea, who 
passed away in Madison on Dec. 14, 
2019. McCrea’s career included praise-
worthy 
journalism, 
architectural 
scholarship on Frank Lloyd Wright, 
and gay activism. 
Ron McCrea came from a family of 
journalists. His grandfather, Archie 
McCrea, was editor of the Muskegon 
Chronicle in Michigan, and his father 
was an editor for the Saginaw News 
and Toledo Blade. Ron began his jour-
nalism career editing his high school 
paper, the Arthur Hill News. He would 
also edit the Albion College Pleiad. He 
worked at the Boston Globe, the Wash-
ington Post, the Washington Star, the 
Long Island Newsday, and the San Jose 
Mercury News. Ron was one of the out-
standing journalists in Madison, where 
he served as an editor and reporter at 
the Capital Times from 1970 to 1977 and 
again from 1998 to 2008. While in Madi-
son, he was also an editor of the Press 
Connection from 1977 to 1980, the paper 
that emerged from a newspaper strike 
that he helped lead. 
Ron graduated from Albion College 
in 1965 with a B.A. in political science. 
He was awarded an M.A. from the 
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy 
at Tufts University and did further 
graduate work at the Medill School of 
Journalism at Northwestern Univer-
sity. 
His gay activism began in the early 
1970s when he joined the Wisconsin’s 
first gay rights organization, the Madi-
son Alliance for Homosexual Equality, 
MAHE, which was founded in the fall of 
1969 after the Stonewall Riots. Ron 
participated in panels that the early 
Gay Center sent out to classes on the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison cam-
pus. In line with his labor activism, he 
successfully lobbied for the Newspaper 
Guild to include nondiscrimination on 
the basis of sexual orientation in its 
model contract used throughout the 
Nation. 
When elected in 1982, Governor An-
thony Earl asked Ron to serve as his 
press secretary. Because of his advo-
cacy, one of the State’s major papers 
headlined 
the 
appointment 
of 
an 
‘‘Avowed Homosexual.’’ Earl refused 
McCrea’s offer to withdraw the ap-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S433 
January 21, 2020 
During his journalism career, Ron 
McCrea became the chronicler of some 
unique LGBT history in the Madison 
area. One of his earliest efforts in-
cluded stories on the hidden 1962 Gay 
Purge at the UW-Madison. He also con-
tributed many unique items to the 
LGBT Collection of the UW-Madison 
Archives. 
Ron loved a good story and enter-
tained many of his friends with his de-
lightful skill in presenting a tale. He 
had a deep love of music and was 
known for singing with Madison choral 
groups and tripping the ivories at the 
piano bar at Going My Way. 
Ron is survived by his wife of 26 
years, Elaine DeSmidt, and his stepson, 
Benjamin DeSmidt. Elaine, described 
as his partner, passion and love, was 
also involved in public life as an elect-
ed member of the Dane County Board 
of Supervisors. 
Ron McCrea was an accomplished 
storyteller, a humorous character, and 
a courageous pioneer. He leaves behind 
a legacy of humble but bold encourage-
ment of the gay community. I am 
proud to honor his unflinching advo-
cacy, personal kindness, and steadfast 
leadership.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JEFF AULBECH, NEIL 
CO´ SPITO, AND MICHAEL JACOBSON 
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to salute the work of three New 
Hampshire-based air traffic control-
lers—Jeff Aulbech, Neil Co´spito, and 
Michael Jacobson—who calmly and 
quickly resolved a complex situation in 
the snowy skies of New England in 2018. 
The three men were awarded the pres-
tigious Archie League Medal of Safety 
Award from the National Air Traffic 
Controllers Association, NATCA, last 
year, and I ask all Americans to join 
me and NATCA in marveling at the 
poise they all showed on that Novem-
ber afternoon. 
Jeff, Neil and Michael work at the 
Boston Air Traffic Control Center, a re-
gional air route traffic control center 
in Nashua, NH, that covers tens of 
thousands of miles of airspace above 
New England, New York, and northeast 
Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, November 
20, 2018, Neil was working an F–16 air-
craft from the 158th Fighter Wing of 
the Vermont Air National Guard. Poor 
weather conditions were preventing the 
pilot from landing the aircraft at its 
home base in Burlington, VT. Neil 
scoured the region for a suitable loca-
tion outside of the sprawling weather 
system, and he quickly found one in 
Syracuse, NY. He cleared the aircraft 
to travel southwest to its new destina-
tion and asked the pilot to estimate his 
time en-route and his remaining fuel. 
When the pilot relayed that he had 15 
minutes of fuel for a 15–minute trip, 
Neil knew that the F–16 had become an 
emergency aircraft. 
As the aircraft left Neil’s controlled 
airspace, fellow air traffic controllers 
Jeff Aulbech and Mike Jacobson con-
tinued working the emergency situa-
tion. Jeff and Mike promptly evaluated 
their options. They decided the best 
course was to divert a flight of KC–135 
tankers from a nearby, unrelated mis-
sion and to conduct a mid-air refueling. 
Jeff explained to the KC–135 pilots that 
the F–16 was at ‘‘Bingo Fuel’’—a term 
used by military pilots when they 
reach a critical and emergency fuel 
state. When he secured agreement from 
both crews, Jeff executed precise time 
intercept vectors to join the two air-
craft and begin refueling. As Jeff 
worked with the aircraft in the sky, 
Mike worked the radar and commu-
nicated with the airport in Syracuse to 
confirm suitable landing conditions. A 
short 
time 
later, 
the 
F–16 
safely 
touched the ground in Syracuse. 
Quick thinking and error-free execu-
tion from Neil Co´spito, Jeff Aulbech, 
and Mike Jacobson saved the F–16 and 
its pilot from a number of dangerous 
alternatives, and they played a pivotal 
role in maneuvering this flawless re-
fueling with a number of other planes 
sharing the skies. As many of us travel 
across the country throughout the 
year, we should take a moment to re-
flect on the significance of air traffic 
controllers like Neil, Jeff, and Mike 
and thank them for working every 
minute of every day each year to keep 
our skies safe. 
On behalf of the people of New Hamp-
shire, I ask my colleagues and all 
Americans to join me in thanking Neil, 
Jeff, and Mike for their service and 
wishing them all the best as they con-
tinue their good work.∑

AS 
‘‘MATERNAL 
HEALTH 
AWARE-
NESS DAY’’ 
Mr. 
BOOKER 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ, and Ms. HARRIS) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 479 
Whereas, every year in the United States, 
approximately 700 women die as a result of 
complications related to pregnancy and 
childbirth; 
Whereas the pregnancy-related mortality 
ratio, defined as the number of pregnancy-re-
lated deaths per 100,000 live births, more 
than doubled between 1987 and 2016; 
Whereas the United States is the only de-
veloped country whose maternal mortality 
rate has increased over the last several dec-
ades; 
Whereas, of all pregnancy-related deaths 
between 2011 and 2015— 
(1) nearly 31 percent occurred during preg-
nancy; 
(2) about 36 percent occurred during child-
birth or the week after childbirth; and 
(3) 33 percent occurred between 1 week and 
1 year postpartum; 
Whereas more than 60 percent of maternal 
deaths in the United States are preventable; 
Whereas, in 2014 alone, 50,000 women suf-
fered from a ‘‘near miss’’ or severe maternal 
morbidity, which includes potentially life- 
threatening complications that arise from 
labor and childbirth; 
Whereas 28 percent of women who gave 
birth in a hospital in the United States re-
ported experiencing 1 or more types of mis-
treatment, such as— 
(1) loss of autonomy; 
(2) being shouted at, scolded, or threat-
ened; and 
(3) being ignored or refused or receiving no 
response to requests for help; 
Whereas certain social determinants of 
health, including bias and racism, have a 
negative impact on maternal health out-
comes; 
Whereas significant disparities in maternal 
health exist, including that— 
(1) Black women are more than 3 times as 
likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause 
as are White women; 
(2) American Indian and Alaska Native 
women are more than twice as likely to die 
from a pregnancy-related cause as are White 
women; 
(3) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Na-
tive women with at least some college edu-
cation are more likely to die from a preg-
nancy-related cause than are women of all 
other racial and ethnic backgrounds with 
less than a high school diploma; 
(4) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Na-
tive women are about twice as likely to suf-
fer from severe maternal morbidity as are 
White women; 
(5) women who live in rural areas have a 
greater likelihood of severe maternal mor-
bidity and mortality compared to women 
who live in urban areas; 
(6) nearly 1⁄2 of rural counties do not have 
a hospital with obstetric services; 
(7) counties with more Black and Hispanic 
residents and lower median incomes are less 
likely to have access to hospital obstetric 
services; 
(8) more than 50 percent of women who live 
in a rural area must travel more than 30 
minutes to access hospital obstetric services, 
compared to 7 percent of women who live in 
urban areas; and 
(9) American Indian and Alaska Native 
women living in rural communities are twice 
as likely as their White counterparts to re-
port receiving late or no prenatal care; 
Whereas more than 40 States have des-
ignated committees to review maternal 
deaths; 
Whereas State and local maternal mor-
tality review committees are positioned to 
comprehensively assess maternal deaths and 
identify opportunities for prevention; 
Whereas more than 25 States are partici-
pating in the Alliance for Innovation on Ma-
ternal Health, which promotes consistent 
and safe maternity care to reduce maternal 
morbidity and mortality; 
Whereas 
community-based 
maternal 
health care models, including midwifery 
childbirth services, doula support services, 
community and perinatal health worker 
services, and group prenatal care, in collabo-
ration with culturally competent physician 
care, show great promise in improving ma-
ternal health outcomes and reducing dispari-
ties in maternal health outcomes; 
Whereas many organizations have imple-
mented initiatives to educate patients and 
providers about— 
(1) all causes of, contributing factors to, 
and disparities in maternal mortality; 
(2) the prevention of pregnancy-related 
deaths; and 
(3) the importance of listening to and em-
powering all women to report pregnancy-re-
lated medical issues; and 
Whereas several States, communities, and 
organizations recognize January 23 as ‘‘Ma-
ternal Health Awareness Day’’ to raise 
awareness about maternal health and pro-
mote maternal safety: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates January 23, 2020, as ‘‘Mater-
nal Health Awareness Day’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Mater-
nal Health Awareness Day, including—

SENATE RESOLUTION 480—RAISING 
AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGING 
THE PREVENTION OF STALKING 
BY DESIGNATING JANUARY 2020 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
STALKING 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. 
GRASSLEY, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Ms. HIRONO, 
Ms. HARRIS, Ms. ERNST, Mrs. BLACK-
BURN, Mr. TILLIS, and Mr. CRAPO) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 480 
Whereas approximately 1 in 6 women in the 
United States, at some point during their 
lifetimes, have experienced stalking victim-
ization, during which the women felt very 
fearful or believed that they or someone 
close to them would be harmed or killed; 
Whereas, during a 1-year period, an esti-
mated 7,500,000 individuals in the United 
States reported that they had been victims 
of stalking; 
Whereas more than 80 percent of victims of 
stalking reported that they had been stalked 
by someone they knew; 
Whereas nearly 70 percent of intimate 
partner stalking victims were threatened 
with physical harm by stalkers; 
Whereas 11 percent of victims of stalking 
reported having been stalked for more than 5 
years; 
Whereas two-thirds of stalkers pursue 
their victims at least once a week; 
Whereas many victims of stalking are 
forced to take drastic measures to protect 
themselves, including relocating, changing 
jobs, or obtaining protection orders; 
Whereas the prevalence of anxiety, insom-
nia, social dysfunction, and severe depres-
sion is much higher among victims of stalk-
ing than the general population; 
Whereas many victims of stalking do not 
report stalking to the police or contact a 
victim service provider, shelter, or hotline; 
Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal 
law and the laws of all 50 States, the District 
of Columbia, and the territories of the 
United States; 
Whereas stalking affects victims of every 
race, age, culture, gender, sexual orienta-
tion, physical and mental ability, and eco-
nomic status; 
Whereas national organizations, local vic-
tim service organizations, campuses, pros-
ecutor’s offices, and police departments 
stand ready to assist victims of stalking and 
are working diligently to develop effective 
and innovative responses to stalking, includ-
ing online stalking; 
Whereas there is a need to improve the re-
sponse of the criminal justice system to 
stalking through more aggressive investiga-
tion and prosecution; 
Whereas there is a need for an increase in 
the availability of victim services across the 
United States, and the services must include 
programs tailored to meet the needs of vic-
tims of stalking; 
Whereas individuals 18 to 24 years old expe-
rience the highest rates of stalking victim-
ization, and a majority of stalking victims 
report their victimization first occurred be-
fore the age of 25; 
Whereas up to 75 percent of women in col-
lege who experience behavior relating to 
stalking experience other forms of victimiza-
tion, including sexual or physical victimiza-
tion; 
Whereas there is a need for an effective re-
sponse to stalking on each campus; and 
Whereas the Senate finds that ‘‘National 
Stalking Awareness Month’’ provides an op-
portunity to educate the people of the 
United States about stalking: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates January 2020 as ‘‘National 
Stalking Awareness Month’’; 
(2) applauds the efforts of service providers 
for victims of stalking, police, prosecutors, 
national and community organizations, cam-
puses, and private sector supporters to pro-
mote awareness of stalking; 
(3) encourages policymakers, criminal jus-
tice officials, victim service and human serv-
ice agencies, institutions of higher edu-
cation, and nonprofit organizations to in-
crease awareness of stalking and continue to 
support the availability of services for vic-
tims of stalking; and 
(4) urges national and community organi-
zations, businesses in the private sector, and 
the media to promote awareness of the crime 
of stalking through ‘‘National Stalking 
Awareness Month’’.

POLAND 
Ms. 
ROSEN 
(for 
herself, 
Mr. 
LANKFORD, Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. CRAMER, 
and Mr. CARDIN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 481 
Whereas, during World War II, the Nazi re-
gime and its collaborators systematically 
murdered 6,000,000 Jews and millions of other 
individuals; 
Whereas 
the 
Auschwitz 
concentration 
camp complex in Nazi-occupied Poland, 
which included a killing center at Birkenau, 
was the largest death camp complex estab-
lished by the Nazi regime; 
Whereas, on January 27, 1945, the Ausch-
witz extermination camp was liberated by 
Allied Forces during World War II, after al-
most 5 years of murder, rape, and torture at 
the camp; 
Whereas nearly 1,300,000 innocent civilians 
were deported to Auschwitz from their 
homes across Eastern and Western Europe, 
particularly from Hungary, Poland, and 
France; 
Whereas nearly 1,100,000 innocent civilians 
were murdered at the Auschwitz extermi-
nation camp between 1940 and 1945; 
Whereas at least 960,000 of the nearly 
1,100,000 murdered people were Jewish; 
Whereas the more than 100,000 other vic-
tims who perished at Auschwitz included 
non-Jewish Poles, Romani people, Soviet ci-
vilians and prisoners of war, Afro-Germans, 
Jehovah’s Witnesses, people with disabil-
ities, gay men and women, and other ethnic 
minorities; 
Whereas these innocent civilians were sub-
jected to torture, forced labor, starvation, 
rape, medical experiments, and being sepa-
rated from loved ones; 
Whereas the names of many of these inno-
cent civilians who perished have been lost 
forever; 
Whereas 
the 
Auschwitz 
extermination 
camp symbolizes the extraordinary brutality 
of the Holocaust; 
Whereas the United States Holocaust Me-
morial Museum teaches about and promotes 
remembrance of the Holocaust; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
must never forget the terrible crimes against 
humanity committed at the Auschwitz ex-
termination camp; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
must educate future generations to promote 
understanding of the dangers of intolerance 
in order to prevent similar injustices, includ-
ing acts of violent anti-Semitism, from hap-
pening again; 
Whereas, in recent years, there has been an 
increase in the number and intensity of anti- 
Semitic incidents in the United States and 
around the world; 
Whereas hate crime statistics collected by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation dem-
onstrate a marked rise in anti-Semitic inci-
dents in the United States over the past sev-
eral years, and the Special Envoy to Monitor 
and Combat Anti-Semitism of the Depart-
ment of State recently stated that the Jew-
ish people worldwide are facing the worst 
wave of anti-Semitism since the Holocaust; 
Whereas, in 2018, the United States experi-
enced the single deadliest attack against the 
Jewish community in the history of the 
United States with the murder of 11 individ-
uals at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania; 
Whereas the attack in Pittsburgh was fol-
lowed in 2019 by a vicious anti-Semitic at-
tack in Poway, California, and later, by a se-
ries of violent attacks against the Orthodox 
Jewish community in the State of New York; 
and 
Whereas, especially in a period of rising 
anti-Semitism, commemoration of the lib-
eration of the Auschwitz extermination 
camp will instill in all people of the United 
States a greater awareness of the Holocaust 
and knowledge of the horrors brought upon 
by the Nazi regime’s systematic murder of 
6,000,000 Jews and millions of other innocent 
individuals: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates January 27, 2020, as the 
75th anniversary of the liberation of the 
Auschwitz extermination camp by Allied 
Forces during World War II; 
(2) calls on all people of the United States 
to remember the 1,100,000 innocent victims 
murdered at the Auschwitz extermination 
camp as part of the Holocaust, the 6,000,000 
Jews killed throughout the Holocaust, and 
all of the victims of the Nazi reign of terror; 
(3) honors the legacy of the survivors of 
the Holocaust and of the Auschwitz extermi-
nation camp; 
(4) calls on the people of the United States 
to continue to work toward tolerance, peace, 
and justice and to continue to work to end 
all genocide and persecution; and 
(5) recommits to combatting all forms of 
anti-Semitism.

RESOLUTION 
482—SUP-
PORTING 
THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS 
Mr. TOOMEY (for himself, Mr. RUBIO, 
and Mr. MANCHIN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 482 
Whereas Catholic schools in the United 
States are internationally acclaimed for 
their academic excellence and provide stu-
dents with more than just an exceptional 
scholastic education; 
Whereas Catholic schools instill a broad, 
values-added education emphasizing the life-
long development of moral, intellectual, 
physical, and social values in young people 
in the United States; 
Whereas Catholic schools serve the United 
States by providing a diverse student popu-
lation, from all regions of the country and 
all socioeconomic backgrounds, a strong aca-
demic and moral foundation, and of that stu-
dent population— 
(1) 39 percent of students are from racial 
and ethnic minority backgrounds; and 
(2) 19 percent of students are from non- 
Catholic families; 
Whereas Catholic schools are an affordable 
option for parents, particularly in under-
served urban areas; 
Whereas Catholic schools produce students 
who are strongly dedicated to their faith, 
values, families, and communities by pro-
viding an intellectually stimulating environ-
ment rich in spiritual, character, and moral 
development; 
Whereas Catholic schools are committed to 
community service, producing graduates who 
hold ‘‘helping others’’ as a core value; 
Whereas, during the 2018–2019 academic 
year in the United States, almost 1,800,000 
students were enrolled in Catholic schools 
and the student-teacher ratio for Catholic 
schools was 12 to 1; 
Whereas the graduation rate of students 
from Catholic high schools is 99 percent, 
with 86 percent of graduates attending 4-year 
colleges; 
Whereas, in the 2005 pastoral message enti-
tled ‘‘Renewing Our Commitment to Catho-
lic Elementary and Secondary Schools in the 
Third Millennium’’, the United States Con-
ference of Catholic Bishops stated, ‘‘Catholic 
schools are often the Church’s most effective 
contribution to those families who are poor 
and disadvantaged, especially in poor inner 
city neighborhoods and rural areas. Catholic 
schools cultivate healthy interaction among 
the increasingly diverse populations of our 
society. In cities and rural areas, Catholic 
schools are often the only opportunity for 
economically disadvantaged young people to 
receive an education of quality that speaks 
to the development of the whole person. . . . 
Our Catholic schools have produced count-
less numbers of well-educated and moral 
citizens who are leaders in our civic and 
ecclesial communities.’’; 
Whereas the week of January 26, 2020, to 
February 1, 2020, has been designated as ‘‘Na-
tional Catholic Schools Week’’ by the Na-
tional Catholic Educational Association and 
the United States Conference of Catholic 
Bishops, and January 29, 2020, has been des-
ignated as ‘‘National Appreciation Day for 
Catholic Schools’’; 
Whereas National Catholic Schools Week 
was first established in 1974 and has been 
celebrated annually for the past 46 years; 
Whereas 30 percent of Catholic schools 
have waiting lists for admission, and new 
schools are opening across the United States; 
and 
Whereas the theme for National Catholic 
Schools Week 2020 is ‘‘Catholic Schools: 
Learn. Serve. Lead. Succeed.’’: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of National Catholic 
Schools Week, an event— 
(A) cosponsored by the National Catholic 
Educational Association and the United 
States Conference of Catholic Bishops; and 
(B) established to recognize the vital con-
tributions of the thousands of Catholic ele-
mentary and secondary schools in the United 
States; 
(2) applauds the National Catholic Edu-
cational Association and the United States 
Conference of Catholic Bishops on the selec-
tion of a theme that all people can celebrate; 
and 
(3) supports— 
(A) the dedication of Catholic schools, stu-
dents, parents, and teachers across the 
United States to academic excellence; and 
(B) the key role that Catholic schools, stu-
dents, parents, and teachers across the 
United States play in promoting and ensur-
ing a brighter, stronger future for the United 
States.

with the exception of motions to subpoena 
witnesses or documents or any other evi-

tions shall be filed no later than 11:00 a.m. on 
Wednesday, January 22, 2020. All materials 
filed pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
filed with the Secretary and be printed and 
made available to all parties. 
Arguments on such motions shall begin at 
1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 22, 2020, and 
each side may determine the number of per-
sons to make its presentation, following 
which the Senate shall deliberate, if so or-
dered under the impeachment rules, and vote 
on any such motions. 
Following the disposition of such motions, 
or if no motions are made, then the House of 
Representatives shall make its presentation 
in support of the articles of impeachment for 
a period of time not to exceed 24 hours, over 
up to 3 session days. Following the House of 
Representatives’ presentation, the President 
shall make his presentation for a period not 
to exceed 24 hours, over up to 3 session days. 
Each side may determine the number of per-
sons to make its presentation. 
Upon the conclusion of the President’s 
presentation, Senators may question the 
parties for a period of time not to exceed 16 
hours. 
Upon the conclusion of questioning by the 
Senate, there shall be 4 hours of argument 
by the parties, equally divided, followed by 
deliberation by the Senate, if so ordered 
under the impeachment rules, on the ques-
tion of whether it shall be in order to con-
sider and debate under the impeachment 
rules any motion to subpoena witnesses or 
documents. The Senate, without any inter-
vening action, motion, or amendment, shall 
then decide by the yeas and nays whether it 
shall be in order to consider and debate 
under the impeachment rules any motion to 
subpoena witnesses or documents. 
Following the disposition of that question, 
other motions provided under the impeach-
ment rules shall be in order. 
If the Senate agrees to allow either the 
House of Representatives or the President to 
subpoena witnesses, the witnesses shall first 
be deposed and the Senate shall decide after 
deposition which witnesses shall testify, pur-
suant to the impeachment rules. No testi-
mony shall be admissible in the Senate un-
less the parties have had an opportunity to 
depose such witnesses. 
At the conclusion of the deliberations by 
the Senate, the Senate shall vote on each ar-
ticle of impeachment.

CONGRATULATING 
NEW 
PRESI-
DENT 
AND 
CABINET 
OF 
THE 
BLACK CLERGY OF PHILADEL-
PHIA AND VICINITY 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 21, 2020 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my sin-
cere congratulations to the incoming President 
and cabinet officers of the Black Clergy of 
Philadelphia and Vicinity. Chosen from among 
their peers, this group of accomplished individ-
uals will be tasked with overseeing the mis-
sion of their organization to ‘‘unify African- 
American clergy grounded in Christian prin-
ciples around issues of social, political and 
economic justice.’’ 
Each and every one of these men and 
women have selflessly devoted themselves, 
over the course of many years, to building and 
sustaining communities of faith that lift up 
those who need a helping hand, that stand up 
for those whose voices are often unheard or 
overlooked, and that fight for equal justice for 
all especially in communities of color. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to include in the RECORD
the 
names of the incoming officers as follows: 
President: Rev. Robert Collier, Sr., First 
Vice President: Bishop J Louis Felton, Second 
Vice President: Rev. Dr. Wayne Weathers, 
Third Vice President: Elder Janet Sturdivant, 
General Secretary: Rev. Maxcine Selby Col-
lier, Treasurer: Rev. Dr. Cassandra Graves, 
Financial Secretary: Rev. Toni Johnson, As-
sistant Secretary: Rev. Maria Tillman, Assist-
ant Treasurer: Rev. Joe Brown, Chaplain: 
Rev. Juanita Walters, Chief Marshall: Rev. Dr. 
Jerome Fordham, Parliamentarian: Rev. Dr. 
Donna Jones, Public Relations: Rev. Dr. 
Charles McNeil, Advisor: Rev. Terrence Grif-
fith. 
As they are all consummate leaders in their 
own right, I am confident that, together, they 
will prove to be more than a match for the 
challenges that await them and that they will 
continue to make the Black Clergy of Philadel-
phia and Vicinity a potent source for good in 
the years to come.

CONGRATULATING ASHRITH 
REDDY 
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 21, 2020 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate middle-schooler Ashrith Reddy 
for the achievement of winning first place in 
the 2019 U.S. Geography Olympiad National 
Championship. 
Ashrith is a student at Marvin Baker Middle 
School in Corpus Christi. 
At the national competition in Chicago, 
though, he represented all of south Texas. 
To earn first place, Ashrith had to compete 
against students in his age group from across 
the country. 
He was quizzed on the historical, cultural, 
urban, and economic facets of geography, 
completing both a written and buzzer test. 
His skills are impressive, and he is only get-
ting better. 
Ashrith won fourth place in 2018, so he per-
severed, studied hard, and finally took home 
the first-place win in 2019. 
Ashrith credits his parents, teachers, and 
school for supporting him in his passion for 
geography. 
I think it is safe to say that, with such deter-
mination and a hard work ethic, Ashrith has a 
successful future ahead of him. 
I congratulate Ashrith on this accomplish-
ment. 
He has made Corpus Christi and all of 
South Texas very proud.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
STEVE

TINEZ’S 
COMMITMENT 
AND 
DEDICATION 
TO 
IDAHO 
HOME 
BUILDERS 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 21, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize Steve Martinez for his hard work, 
commitment and dedication to the Idaho State 
Home Builders Association. 
Last year was not an easy year for the 
State Home Builders Association. While the 
economy and businesses were booming, the 
association had a difficult year with the pass-
ing of Executive Officer, Frankie Hickman, 
who ran not only the local Building Contractors 
Association for Western Idaho, but also the 
State Association for 27 years. 
Steve is not only a hard worker and driven 
individual, but he is also a kind and compas-
sionate person. He recognized the need of 
helping Frankie through her most difficult 
stretches and when the time came, he picked 
up the pieces and supported the staff as well 
as his peers within the association. 
Steve Martinez grew up in the home build-
ing industry, his father was a custom home-
builder, a Past President of the local Building 
Contractors Association as well as Idaho State 
President. Steve followed in his father’s foot-
steps in many ways, including his profession 
and positions within the home builder associa-
tions. Steve is also the national builder rep-
resentative and is a member of the National 
Association of Home Builders Finance Com-
mittee. He recently received several awards 
including ‘One to Watch’ from the National As-
sociation. 
I personally have had the pleasure of get-
ting to know Steve and have appreciated the 
opportunity to work with him. He is extremely 
professional and passionate about home own-
ership and the needs of his community. 
I congratulate Steve on his 2019 Special 
Recognition Award, as it is well deserved.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF DR. 
CARROL WAYMON 
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 21, 2020 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise with admiration and respect to honor and 
remember the tremendous legacy of Dr. Carrol 
Waymon, who passed away in his San Diego 
home on January 3, 2020 at the age of 94. 
Waymon was a champion for racial equality 
and one of the most impactful educators in 
San Diego’s history. 
Born to a family of eight in North Carolina, 
Waymon overcame many obstacles before 
making his way to San Diego. He received an 
undergraduate education from Howard Univer-
sity followed by masters in psychology and 
education from Temple University. 
In 1964, he was working on racial issues for 
the Los Angeles Human Relations Agency 
when a request for assistance came from the 
San Diego City Council to assess racial injus-
tice in the city. 
Waymon chose to move to San Diego and 
dedicated his life to our community. While 
other cities experienced significant racial ten-
sions, Waymon saw an opportunity for San 
Diego to build bridges and improve the lives of 
all citizens. 
In 1967, Waymon was appointed head of 
the Citizens Interracial Committee (CIC), San 
Diego’s first human relations agency. During 
his tenure he chaired more than 40 public 
meetings and spearheaded the drafting and 
adoption of San Diego’s first equal employ-
ment opportunity ordinances. 
Among the many achievements realized by 
the CIC, Waymon played a critical role in re-
moving housing restrictions for people of color, 
making it possible for African Americans to 
stay in any major hotel across the County, try 
on clothes in department stores, and dine in 
major restaurants. 
Waymon was also widely regarded as a bril-
liant educator who was responsible for the 
founding of San Diego State University’s 
Africana Studies Department. He enjoyed a 
33-year career working with San Diego Mesa 
College as a psychology, sociology, and an-
thropology professor.

January 21, 2020 
I was privileged to have the opportunity to 
personally witness and appreciate his drive to 
bring people together in order to create a bet-
ter community. I always admired his focus on 
education for all at the center of all he did; a 
wise and thoughtful approach. 
I genuinely treasured our warm relationship 
and will sorely miss his presence in the com-
munity. 
While San Diego has lost a giant, I believe 
that his life’s work will serve as a legacy and 
example for future generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you please join me 
in remembering and commemorating the great 
life of Dr. Carrol Waymon.
