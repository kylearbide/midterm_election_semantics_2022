PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of mercy, thank You for giving 
us another day. 
Bless the Members of the people’s 
House today. For those who have test-
ed positive, bring them healing; for 
those in quarantine, keep them safe; 
for those working hard here or at 
home, give success to their efforts to 
benefit our suffering Nation and world. 
During this time when we cannot 
physically wrap our arms around each 
other, let us yet find ways to be Your 
loving embrace to our neighbors. 
May we who are merely inconven-
ienced remember those whose lives are 
at stake. 
May we who have no risk factors re-
member those most vulnerable. 
May we who have the luxury of work-
ing from home remember those who 
must choose between preserving their 
health or making their rent. 
May we who have the flexibility to 
care 
for 
our 
children 
when 
their 
schools close remember those who have 
no options. 
May we who have to cancel our trips 
remember those who have no place to 
go. 
May we who are losing our margin 
money in the tumult of the economic 
market remember those who have no 
margin at all. 
May we who settle in for a quar-
antine at home remember those who 
have no home. 
Every day we are called to be holy 
people. Help us to be our best selves, 
and may all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the Fed-
eral Government has the responsibility to help 
individuals and businesses through this crisis 
because it is the government that shut down 
the economy—not American workers. Ameri-
cans and their employers are not responsible 
for the economic damage being wrought by 
coronavirus, and I am pleased that the 
CARES Act will provide an unprecedented 
amount of immediate relief. However, I have 
deep concerns about this legislation, and I will 
be voting in opposition. 
First, there has been absolutely no discus-
sion on how we will ultimately pay for the tril-
lions of dollars of new federal spending in this 
bill. As we incur this massive debt, we should 
be at least considering how we will one day 
pay it. The House has failed in its duty to take 
up consideration of this legislation by regular 
order. There has been no due diligence to re-
view the language in detail within our commit-
tees, no opportunity to hear from expert wit-
nesses regarding its effectiveness, and no op-
tion for our Members to address concerns or 
provide 
thoughtful 
solutions 
through 
the 
amendment 
process. 
Moreover, 
language 
within the bill willfully shirks our oversight au-
thority and responsibility by waiving the open 
meetings requirement. 
Furthermore, I fear this legislation is still just 
the tip of the iceberg. In a short period of time, 
we have moved from a few billion in phase 
one to over a hundred billion in phase two, 
and we now are considering $2.2 trillion in 
phase three. There is already talk of a fourth 
and fifth package to allow Democrats to ad-
vance many of their liberal partisan policies 
that did not make it into this bill during a time 
when no funding that is not directly related to 
crisis assistance should be considered. We 
must also weigh what precedents we are es-
tablishing. The CARES Act brings with it a 
massive expansion of the size and role of the 
Federal Government outside the scope of 
what our Founders intended. What we are 
doing here today is unsustainable and cannot 
be repeated for subsequent future emer-
gencies that will undoubtedly and unfortu-
nately occur. Maximum freedom exists within 
a context of limited government, and we have 
seen on countless occasions that once the 
Federal Government institutes new programs 
or spending that it is almost impossible to re-
verse the trajectory of its new footprint on our 
lives. 
Secondly, while I am supportive of providing 
Americans a bridge of assistance through the 
coronavirus, I am concerned that this legisla-
tion will cause some to obtain significantly 
more in unemployment benefits than they 
would normally earn through their jobs, inad-
vertently 
incentivizing 
unemployment. 
We 
must strike a balance between smart health 
policy and smart economic policy, and that 
means Americans should be allowed to go 
back to work as soon as it’s safe to do so. Un-
fortunately, the language in the bill creates a 
disincentive for many to return to the work-
force over the next four months. 
Third, it is unacceptable that Democrats 
have stuffed this bill with funding for agencies 
and causes completely unrelated to the 
coronavirus outbreak. Just to name a few, the 
bill contains within it $1 billion for Amtrak, $37 
million to the Forest Service, $25 million for 
the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, $75 
million to the National Foundation on the Arts 
and Humanities and a combined $10.8 billion 
for several international development organi-
zations. Many of these are fine institutions that 
do good work for our Nation, but they have no 
place in an emergency package aimed at res-
cuing American families and stimulating our 
economy during a time of crisis. 
President Donald Trump has done an in-
credible job leading America through this cri-
sis. We are blessed to have his leadership, 
and while I am unable to support this par-
ticular legislation, I look forward to continuing 
to support him and working with his Adminis-
tration in combatting the coronavirus. 
May God pour out his mercy and grace on 
our Nation during this time and heal our Land. 
God bless the great State of Georgia, and 
God bless America.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, in my congres-
sional career I’ve served during many chal-
lenging times. Each one required Members of 
Congress to understand the national crisis, ap-
preciate the separation of powers, and know 
his or her district. 
Some events were long and protracted like 
impeachment, but others, like 9/11 for exam-
ple, hit like a lightning strike, unpredictable, 
powerful and life altering. The coronavirus out-
break is one of these events that struck out of 
the blue. 
Yes, it started in China. Yes, the world was 
slow to understand its true danger. But even 
as the world scurries around in an attempt to 
mitigate its damage and slow its spread, the 
United States is rising to the challenge with 
unheard of speed—amazingly so during this 
time of divided chambers and divided govern-
ment. 
On March 4, the Coronavirus Preparedness 
and Response Supplemental Appropriation Act 
was signed into law. This quick response pro-
vided $4 billion to increase the availability of 
tests. $2.2 billion went to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and $1 billion to state and local 
response efforts. It also jump-started public 
and private efforts toward developing a vac-
cine (which is already being tested). 
On March 18, the Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act was signed into law. The bill’s 
$2.5 billion ensured that the government 
would cover the cost of testing. Anyone be-
coming sick themselves, or needing to care for 
an infected loved one, would be entitled to 
paid leave. Food assistance was expanded for 
the needy. Some federal Unemployment Insur-
ance requirements were also relaxed, making 
it easier to apply and quicker to receive bene-
fits. 
On March 27, the Coronavirus Aid and Re-
lief and Economic Security (CARES) Act will 
be signed into law. This bill directed cash as-
sistance to most Americans. In my district, 
two-thirds of my constituents are eligible for 
the full amount and 97 percent of all house-
holds in my district should be eligible for some 
amount. For those who may not need this 
cash assistance for themselves, the bill also 
authorized a $300 charitable tax deduction 
whether a taxpayer itemizes or not. 
To help ensure workers have jobs to return 
to, the CARES Act provided $500 billion to the 
Treasury Stabilization Fund to make loans, 
loan guarantees and other investments. To 
benefit, borrowers must maintain employment 
levels as March 24, 2020 and retain 90 per-
cent of employees. The bill also directed $349 
billion to the Small Business Administration’s 
7(a) Loan Program. These loans will be ad-
ministered through local financial institutions 
and are available to eligible to small busi-
nesses, independent contractors, self em-
ployed individuals, nonprofits and veteran or-
ganizations. 
Other notable provisions of the CARES Act 
included 
$100 
billion 
for 
unreimbursed 
COVID–19 costs, $1.32 billion for community 
health centers, $15.5 billion for the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program (known 
more commonly as food stamps), $25 million 
for long distance learning and telemedicine 
through USDA Rural Development, and liabil-
ity protection for medical device manufactur-
ers. The provisions in the CARES Act are 
much more extensive than my short summary, 
and I would direct those interested in learning 
more about the bill to the Ways and Means 
Committee website. 
It is always fashionable to look for someone 
to blame in these situations. Even within our 
legislative branch, Members have commu-
nicated for or against certain aspects of the 
response, whether for sincere policy objec-
tions or in hopes of gaining some local polit-
ical benefit. Make no mistake, this always hap-
pens because it’s part of our human nature. 
The Framers understood this well, and that’s 
why our bicameral legislative branch creates 
its own checks on each Chamber. The Senate 
remains the cooling saucer of debate, just as 
Washington and Jefferson discussed more 
than two centuries ago. 
In times like these, I’m thankful we have a 
constitutional republic under a federal system

March 31, 2020 
of governance, with the limited duties and 
powers of the federal government spelled out 
clearly in our Constitution. Over the years the 
federal government has crept into the respon-
sibilities of the states, but the 10th Amend-
ment stipulates that if those duties are not list-
ed they are the responsibility of the states. We 
are partners and all have to play our respec-
tive part. I think the Congress, in passing 
three response bills in twenty-three days, has 
done its part. 
I am also a capitalist and believe that free 
markets provide the highest quality goods and 
services at the lowest cost. I also believe in 
risk and reward—the power of individuals or 
groups raising capital and assuming risk with 
the hope of earning a return on that invest-
ment. Notice I say ‘‘hope’’ because in a free 
market a return is not guaranteed. During the 
financial collapse of 2008 I voted against the 
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). I did 
so because the market collapse was due to 
bad management and those responsible 
should have borne the cost. I also believed al-
lowing this to occur would speed up the recov-
ery. 
This market involvement is fundamentally 
different. For me and many conservatives this 
is a takings debate. The government—whether 
federal, state or local—is forcing businesses to 
freeze economic activity. In essence, the gov-
ernment is depriving businesses of income 
they would otherwise be free to earn. What we 
have done in the third coronavirus bill is at-
tempt to keep the employee and employer 
afloat until economic activity can resume, and 
to compensate those who have been ordered 
to forgo the fruits of their investment and 
labor. 
As a retiring Member I have the ability to 
step back and observe the big picture while 
still having access to some inner rooms, or in 
this case some inner (and many) conference 
calls. The crying and gnashing of teeth has 
occurred on both sides. Whether it was Re-
publicans attacking Speaker PELOSI for delay-
ing the process with her attempt to jam in 
Green New Deal inspired provisions, or Demo-
crats attacking Congressman MASSIE
who 
thought it was not too much to ask for a re-
corded vote on an unpaid-for $2 trillion spend-
ing bill that would immediately increase the 
national debt to $25 trillion. 
Members were thrown into a real quandary 
by the looming request for a recorded vote on 
this bill. Some were hunkered down in D.C. 
Most, like myself, were hunkered down in our 
home districts. Many Members would make a 
long drive to D.C. while others would risk air 
travel. To some it was an impossible commute 
with the limited time. I have the concern of an 
elderly parent living with me. Emotions were 
running high for everyone. 
I think that what we observed is Congress 
working at its best. A recorded vote was re-
quested by Congressman MASSIE, which was 
his right. Democrat Whip CLYBURN and Re-
publican Whip SCALISE did their jobs and 
counted to ensure that a quorum of 216 Mem-
bers were present. If my inside information is 
correct, 130 Democrats along with 120 Repub-
licans were present. But while the Rules of the 
House dictate that any Member may ask for a 
recorded vote, his or her request must be sup-
ported at least one-fifth of a quorum. No one 
joined Congressman MASSIE in support of his 
request. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill will pass by voice vote 
and signed into law that same day. Members 
were also given the opportunity to include in 
the RECORD how they would have voted, 
should a recorded vote have been ordered. I 
would have voted yes.

TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BEN McADAMS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, as I continue 
to receive treatment in a Utah hospital for 
COVID–19, I am not able to vote on H.R. 748, 
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Se-
curity (CARES) Act. Had I been present and 
able to vote, I would have voted ‘aye’. This bill 
is certainly not perfect and raises significant 
concerns about fiscal responsibility and appro-
priate use of taxpayer dollars. 
Nonetheless, we have a responsibility to 
protect the health and economic well-being of 
our state and our country. This bill provides 
critical support for working families, our front- 
line health care providers, community workers, 
state and local governments, and Utah small 
businesses and their employees. Coronavirus 
remains a danger to our lives and our liveli-
hoods. I am proud to have championed a key 
oversight provision—a Treasury Department 
Special Inspector General for Pandemic Re-
covery—to track and account for disbursement 
and spending of taxpayer dollars. I will work to 
ensure we fix problems as they arise and 
focus on doing what is best for Utahns. 
I believe we will get through this by giving 
communities, health care providers and local 
governments the tools they need to respond 
quickly and efficiently to what’s happening on 
the ground with maximum flexibility and ac-
countability. I believe in Utahns and I believe 
in Americans; everyday heroes will help us 
overcome and as a Representative, I must do 
my part to get urgently needed resources to 
Utahns.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, America is facing a 
very serious public health crisis that also has 
the potential to affect the long-term health of 
our economy. 
The people on the front lines fighting the 
spread of COVID–19—our doctors, nurses, 
first responders, and other health profes-
sionals—need help. Congress should be step-
ping up to ensure America’s health care sys-
tem has access to needed personal protective 
equipment—like masks and face shields—and 
testing supplies to identify those infected and 
to help stop the spread of the virus. Busi-
nesses and employees affected by this virus 
also need help. Congress should be providing 
short-term financial assistance such as loans 
and in the form of a tax holiday. I recognize 
these needs and fully support action to pro-
vide resources to stem the damage being 
caused in the present crisis. 
There is no question that this crisis is a di-
rect result of the Chinese government’s cover 
up of the dangers posed by COVID–19. The 
Chinese government failed to heed the early 
warnings of medical professionals, going so 
far as to persecute individuals like Dr. Li 
Wenliang, who was among the first to raise 
concerns, forcing him to sign a confession that 
his concerns were false. China ordered de-
struction of early research samples of the 
virus. The Chinese government also denied 
World Health Organization (WHO) investiga-
tors access inside the country’s borders and 
they withheld critical information. The Chinese 
Communist Party falsely denied the evidence 
of human-to-human transmission. Contrary to 
WHO guidelines, Chinese officials manipulated 
statistics by failing to report infected individ-
uals who tested positive for the virus if they 
exhibited mild to no symptoms. China’s au-
thoritarian government also allowed up to 
5,000,000 people, including potentially tens of 
thousands of infected individuals, to leave 
Wuhan and travel across the globe, spreading 
the virus. The reality is that China was more 
interested in saving face than stopping the 
problem before it became a global pandemic. 
China was more interested in waging an inter-
national public relations campaign than getting 
the necessary help from the world community. 
The United States and countries across the 
globe are now dealing with the fallout of Chi-
na’s deceit and misdeeds. We are wrestling 
with how to address a public health crisis, 
contain this deadly virus, and respond to un-
precedented economic fallout. To address the 
current situation, Congress must act respon-
sibly and thoughtfully but also with urgency. 
We must work together to support doctors, 
nurses and other health professionals. We 
need to also help suffering families, assist 
businesses and non-profits that have been or-
dered to close, and to set the stage for yet an-
other American comeback. 
Nearly every American has been affected by 
this virus. All levels of government have asked 
our citizens to stay home. Government has 
asked businesses to shutter their doors, and 
for America’s health care professionals to cou-
rageously work longer hours, sometimes with-
out the necessary supplies to protect them-
selves. Americans are tired, fearful, and 
distancing themselves from friends and neigh-
bors when what they truly desire is commu-
nity. The American people have been told this 
was necessary and that if they made these 
sacrifices we could ‘‘bend the curve’’ and stop 
the spread of the virus. 
While President Trump and Republicans 
have been trying to lead, and the American 
people have been doing their part, Democrats 
have engaged in political games. The House 
Democratic Whip told his colleagues that this 
crisis was a ‘‘tremendous opportunity to re-
structure things to fit our vision.’’ In the Sen-
ate, all but one Democrat voted to hold up de-
bate on this bill for several days, simply to ex-
tract as many political concessions as pos-
sible. In response to the tremendous and pa-
triotic sacrifices by the American people, 
Democrats have played politics. They saw a 
crisis that they did not want to let go to waste 
and chose to exploit the American peoples’ 
fear and misery for political gain. That is un-
conscionable. 
Today, we finally reached the point where 
we could debate the merits of this bill in the

House and fulfill our Constitutional responsi-
bility. Every Member’s duty was to read the 
bill, evaluate its merits, and then vote his or 
her conscience. I concluded that, if I were 
given the chance, I would vote against this bill. 
History and experience tell us that the provi-
sions in this bill will do long-lasting damage to 
the economic well-being of millions of Amer-
ican families and small businesses, delaying a 
future economic recovery and harming the 
people most in need of help. 
This bill repeats the mistakes of the past. It 
contains the same kind of flawed provisions 
that the Democrat-controlled Congress en-
acted in 2008 to deal with the mortgage crisis. 
America cannot afford another slow growth 
decade like we had under President Obama. 
Yet that is exactly the kind of future this bill is 
poised to give us. I want to put a stop to the 
damage that COVID–19 is doing, including to 
our economy, but this bill will only prolong the 
economic recovery. 
Many provisions of this bill recognize that 
economic stability depends on employment 
stability. This bill, however, contains provisions 
unrelated to fighting the disease, and worse, 
incentives that will lead to more, not fewer, 
layoffs. The people most likely to be affected 
will be primarily middle-class families and 
lower wage earners. 
The bill incentivizes layoffs by providing for 
‘‘unemployment insurance (UI) on steroids,’’ or 
regular unemployment benefits together with 
$600 per week above the traditional benefit 
level. One of the perverse incentives of this 
bill is that it would leave many employees fi-
nancially better off if they were laid-off than if 
they continued working. On the one hand, 
Congress is incentivizing small businesses to 
borrow billions of dollars from the Small Busi-
ness Administration to keep people employed 
while simultaneously creating counterincen-
tives that will encourage unemployment. That 
makes no sense. 
I support policies that will encourage job 
stability. Our economic recovery will be has-
tened if people have a job ready and waiting 
for them once we get past the current health 
crisis; it will help people maintain their health 
insurance; it will give people hope; and a 
ready workforce will help avoid supply chain 
disruptions and shortages of critical supplies 
needed to fight this virus. 
This bill also contains provisions that will un-
necessarily extend the recovery of America’s 
capital markets. Currently, the markets are 
down about 30-percent from their all-time 
highs from just a few weeks ago. In this next 
economic recovery, we must focus on bringing 
stability to capital markets as we rebuild the 
job market. This bill, however, contains provi-
sions that will deny this needed stability. Sec-
tion 4003 prohibits businesses that utilize the 
lending and loan guarantee programs from en-
gaging in stock buybacks and issuing divi-
dends—not only during the term of the loan 
but even after the loan has been repaid. Al-
lowing stock redemptions and dividends could 
help calm volatility in the capital markets. Con-
gress should not discourage these kinds of ac-
tions. We need to help bring stability back to 
the stock market. 
Other provisions give a green light to union 
organizers while preventing a business from 
speaking out against union activities. Busi-
nesses that access government loans in the 
short term, including so that they can pay their 
employees, are being given a long-term 
‘‘stand-down’’ order by Congress when it 
comes to this issue. Businesses that will be 
affected by this are currently in crisis and Con-
gress’ response is to put its thumb on the 
scale in favor of labor, a Democrat constitu-
ency that funnels millions into Democrat cam-
paign coffers. 
These provisions also lose sight of the fact 
that many businesses that utilize these pro-
grams will do so not because of their own mis-
management or malfeasance but because 
government told these businesses to shut their 
doors. Or, in some cases, because patriotic 
business owners took out a loan to retool or 
ramp up production to manufacture critical 
medical supplies like ventilators, hospital 
masks and testing kits even when that is not 
their normal business. 
It makes no sense to punish these compa-
nies with these kinds of restrictions but espe-
cially after the loan has been repaid. If we tie 
the hands of business for years to come, we 
should not expect a full and robust economic 
recovery. These restrictions are unreasonable. 
They may discourage companies from taking 
out loans. This, in turn, will put people out of 
work, harming American families and small 
businesses. 
Dating back to Greek times, physicians 
swore the Hippocratic Corpus. It was an oath, 
a code of medical ethics, in which a physician 
pledged to ‘‘help the sick and abstain from all 
intentional wrong-doing and harm. . . .’’ That 
obligation is sometimes summarized as, ‘‘First, 
do no harm.’’ As Congress considers this leg-
islation, we would do well to follow the Hippo-
cratic Oath ourselves. We should not pass a 
law that includes extraneous spending or that 
would further impose economic harm on strug-
gling American families and small businesses. 
Finally, I want to make this point. It is often 
said that ‘‘crisis reveals character.’’ The re-
sponse of the American people to this crisis 
says a lot about their character. Over and over 
again, Americans have demonstrated that they 
are strong, independent, entrepreneurial, resil-
ient, patriotic, and compassionate and that 
they are willing to sacrifice to get our nation 
through. I am encouraged by their spirit. 
What the present crisis reveals about Con-
gress, however, is tragic. The simple truth is 
that Congress has failed to plan and budget 
for an emergency such as an economic reces-
sion, a natural disaster, a national security 
threat, or a public health crisis. Every member 
of Congress knows that, once every few 
years, we will be called on to respond to a dis-
aster. Yet, Congress fails to plan properly. Our 
budget does not include any reserves to deal 
with these emergencies. 
Accordingly, when faced with a crisis, Con-
gress rushes to pass an emergency spending 
bill—like this one—that adds billions and bil-
lions or trillions more to the deficit. Today’s bill 
spends nearly $6 trillion when we factor in the 
anticipated response of the Federal Reserve. 
This spending is on top of the already pro-
jected annual deficit of $1.083 trillion and a 
national debt of $23.6 trillion. Congress cannot 
keep doing this. Congress needs to cut spend-
ing, balance the budget, and establish an 
emergency fund so that we can deal with 
these crises responsibly. 
I also want to note an additional way in 
which Congress has failed in its Constitutional 
responsibilities. The House of Representatives 
is a co-equal to the Senate. While the Senate 
was working this past week, the Democratic 
House leadership had members sitting at 
home. Speaker PELOSI should have convened 
the House on Monday. This would have made 
it possible for the House to engage in a full 
debate, to deliberate, and even propose better 
ideas. That did not happen. Instead, this bill, 
which is the single largest supplemental

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 748, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security (CARES) Act. On 
Thursday, the United States gained the unfor-
tunate distinction of being the country with the 
largest number of known COVID–19 cases in 
the world. As people across the country strug-
gle to stem the COVID–19 pandemic, this bill 
is an urgently needed $2 trillion disaster-relief 
package that delivers immediate support to in-
dividuals, families, and small businesses 
across the country, while also providing work-
er-centered relief for some industries. 
My home state of Washington has been 
reeling from the spread of COVID–19, with 
over 3,200 cases and 147 deaths as of last 
night. I am so proud that we have one of the 
finest public health systems in the country, but 
it is under siege—as are our healthcare insti-
tutions, our economy, and my constituents. I 
have been focusing my efforts wholly and 
completely on ensuring that we in Congress 
do everything in our power to deliver a re-
sponse from the Federal government that 
matches the enormous scale of this crisis. 
This bill is an important step in that direc-
tion, though we will certainly need to do even 
more. The CARES Act puts $100 billion into 
ensuring hospitals and healthcare providers 
can cover COVID–19-related costs and $200 
million to prevent the spread of COVID–19 in 
nursing homes. Importantly, after years of dis-
investment in the Strategic National Stockpile, 
the CARES Act adds $16 billion to the Stock-
pile to provide essential personal protective 
equipment for our frontline workers and emer-
gency responders. 
This bill also includes a critical priority for 
me: the largest expansion of unemployment 
insurance in decades to ensure that most 
workers get nearly 100 percent of their pre- 
layoff wage without traditional restrictions. It 
also creates a special Pandemic Unemploy-
ment Assistance program to provide relief to 
those who may be ineligible for regular unem-
ployment benefits, like gig workers and people 
who are self-employed. 
Because people are suffering right now, I 
believe we must include direct cash support to 
individuals. I had advocated for double the 
amount that is in the bill, for monthly instead 
of a one-time payment, and for everyone to be 
included. We were not able to get that. How-
ever, the CARES Act delivers $1,200 per adult 
and $500 per child in cash relief to the vast 
majority of everyday people to immediately 
help put cash in people’s pockets to pay those 
mounting bills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E340 
March 31, 2020 
To keep people in their homes, the bill pro-
vides $3 billion in rental assistance. It enacts 
a 120-day moratorium on evictions for prop-
erties receiving federal assistance as well as 
a 60-day foreclosure moratorium on federally 
backed mortgages and up to 180 days of for-
bearance. The bill also includes crucial fund-
ing to the Emergency Services Grant to en-
sure we are providing care to people experi-
encing homelessness. However, we still need 
a real response to the surge of homelessness 
in this time of crisis. My Housing is a Human 
Right Act, introduced last week, puts important 
measures on the table to ensure that we ad-
dress homelessness in the short and longer- 
term. 
One of the most important things I heard 
from my district was the pain and suffering of 
small business owners and non-profits of all 
sizes. The CARES Act creates a Payment 
Protection Program that helps businesses 
keep workers on payroll, through $350 billion 
in forgivable loans that can also be used for 
payroll, rent, utilities, and other necessary 
costs that will help small businesses weather 
the crisis. Small businesses will also have 
some opportunity to receive direct grants of 
$10,000 as an emergency bridge loan. The bill 
creates safeguards to protect against employ-
ers gaming the program. It also recognizes 
that some employers will be forced to do tem-
porary furloughs, but then bring their employ-
ees back on. This is a pro-worker provision 
that will incentivize employers to avoid layoffs. 
It is crucial that we in Congress ensure that 
these loans are carefully managed and scruti-
nized to prevent predatory lenders from taking 
advantage of desperate times to force unfair 
or exploitative loan terms on small businesses, 
and to prevent bundling or repackaging in 
ways that would create expanded economic 
inequality or lead to the unstable market con-
ditions that caused the last major recession. 
On education, the bill invests over $30 bil-
lion for states, school districts, and institutions 
of higher education to help alleviate the chal-
lenges educators, students, and families are 
struggling with in light of school and childcare 
center closures. This is especially acute for 
students with disabilities, English language 
learners, and students experiencing homeless-
ness. However, as state budgets decline due 
to the pandemic response, it will be critical for 
Congress to step in and ensure equity for our 
nation’s students. Specifically, Congress must 
take further steps to address the ‘‘homework 
gap’’ and ensure the tens of millions of stu-
dents at home have the technology they need 
to ensure they do not fall behind. 
The CARES Act also helps borrowers facing 
insurmountable student loan payments during 
the pandemic. It suspends payments for all 
federally-held student loans through Sep-
tember 30, 2020, during which time interest 
will not accrue, and borrowers will continue to 
receive credit toward Public Service Loan For-
giveness, Income-Driven Repayment forgive-
ness, and loan rehabilitation. It also prohibits 
forced collections such as garnishment of 
wages, tax refunds, and Social Security bene-
fits, and negative credit reporting during this 
time period. While the bill does require the 
Education Secretary to keep borrowers ap-
prised of when normal payments will resume 
after the pandemic ends, Congress will need 
to exert strong oversight over servicers and 
Department of Education to ensure that stu-
dents aren’t penalized for taking advantage of 
this program. I am disappointed that millions 
of borrowers holding over $300 billion in pri-
vate student loans, federal Perkins loans, and 
commercially held federal student loans are 
left out of the relief this bill provides. There is 
no doubt that Congress must take significant 
additional steps to expand student debt relief 
during this pandemic to avoid another crisis 
that followed the last financial meltdown. 
Adopting pieces of my College for All Act and, 
at a minimum, cancelling student loan debt for 
the duration of this crisis would not only pro-
vide enormous relief and avoid fiscal cliffs for 
student loan borrowers, it would also con-
tribute to stimulating the economy as we move 
into recovery. I will be pushing for this in the 
next package. 
It is critically important that we immediately 
address the unique funding delays that Native 
American tribes have faced in the COVID–19 
response and supports chronically under-
funded programs in the Indian Health Service. 
I’m proud that this bill begins to do that. It en-
sures Native American Tribes, Tribally owned 
businesses and Native American owned busi-
ness have equal access to federal COVID–19 
economic recovery resources by establishing 
an $8 billion Tribal Coronavirus Relief fund 
and ensuring parity in access to other crucial 
programs to help Native American commu-
nities across the country. 
There is no question that this bill is not per-
fect. There are many things in our Democratic 
House bill that reflect the urgency and scale of 
the crisis that did not make it into this bill. 
There are also things in the bill that Repub-
licans insisted on—such as a $500 billion 
‘‘slush fund’’ for the Treasury Secretary—that 
allow for giant corporations to get enormous 
amounts of taxpayer dollars with little over-
sight or accountability. We must immediately 
work to strengthen those accountability provi-
sions and ensure that there is real authority 
for the Oversight Panel that was established 
as a last-minute concession to Republicans. 
We should use the kinds of worker-centered 
conditions that we were able to include in the 
provisions on airline industry assistance as a 
model: ensuring that funds go to support the 
payroll and benefits of employees, prohibiting 
stock buybacks and dividends, as well as real 
limitations on executive compensation for cor-
porations that receive taxpayer assistance. 
That will ensure that corporations and CEOs 
are not getting blank checks while millions of 
people remain unemployed, without paid leave 
or health care during this crisis and the subse-
quent recovery period. 
Nor is this package sufficient. Unfortunately, 
the scale of this crisis is enormous and we are 
only beginning to see the devastation it will 
wreak on our families, communities, and econ-
omy. I will immediately begin drafting priorities 
for the next package. These will include: more 
money for states and localities, our health 
care system, and a strong and robust safety 
net that includes everyone. We must ensure 
health care—from testing to treatment to re-
covery—for everyone without costs. We have 
to immediately fix the fact that too many immi-
grants—including those who are working right 
now to guarantee food is put into food banks 
and on tables across the country—are ex-
cluded from any relief we have passed, simply 
because they are undocumented, DACA and 
TPS recipients, or legal permanent residents 
who have been here for less than five years. 
This is immoral. COVID–19 does not discrimi-
nate based on country of origin or immigration 
status and our relief packages cannot discrimi-
nate either. 
Our next package must include strong pro-
tections against price-gouging, including a 
specific mandate that the Federal Trade Com-
mission prioritize and proactively prosecute 
cases of COVID-related price gouging, and 
safeguards to prevent large corporate mergers 
from taking place while oversight bodies are 
distracted by this pandemic. And all federal 
agencies must temporarily halt all rulemaking 
that is unrelated to COVID–19 as our states 
and municipalities struggle to respond to ur-
gent community needs. 
In addition, we must ensure that robust paid 
leave provisions apply to all workers in this 
time of crisis, including at companies that em-
ploy 500 or more workers. These large com-
panies are best situated to implement leave 
policies that will be most impactful in pre-
venting the spread of COVID. It is vitally im-
portant that they play their part during this 
pandemic and meet, at minimum, the paid 
leave standards we laid out in our second re-
lief package for small businesses. We also 
must protect seniors and people with disabil-
ities who rely on homecare and direct care 
workers to live independently by continuing to 
add Medicaid FMAP increases that specifically 
allow for higher wages, paid leave, and safety 
equipment for this crucial workforce. In this 
time when so many working parents are strug-
gling to both care for children and work, we 
must also ensure that the childcare providers 
funded through Childcare Development Block 
Grants are paid living wages and have access 
to paid leave. Further, large on-demand com-
panies that benefit from the labor of low-wage 
workers, but classify those workers as inde-
pendent contractors, must pay their fair share 
and put money into the unemployment insur-
ance state system. 
Our next package must immediately enact 
strong OSHA emergency standards to protect 
our frontline health care workers. This was 
stripped out by Republicans and that is uncon-
scionable. Failure to include these protections 
will devastate our frontline workers in health 
care and other critical functions that we need 
to keep our communities functioning even dur-
ing Stay Home orders. As our nation depends 
on health care workers and other essential 
employees to help and protect all of us from 
the spread of COVID–19, the very least we 
can do is require employers to take the nec-
essary steps to mitigate hazards that jeop-
ardize worker safety and health. 
Finally, we must also protect the health and 
safety of people in the criminal justice and im-
migration detention systems. These people 
are dependent on the government for every-
thing; and it is incumbent on us to ensure their 
safety. People should not have to go on hun-
ger strike to get soap simply so they can fol-
low public health guidance and wash their 
hands—one of the most basic protections to 
guard against the spread of COVID–19. These 
jails, prisons, and detention centers are so 
crowded, it is nearly impossible to practice so-
cial distancing in congregate settings. We 
must immediately take basic steps to reduce 
the risk of what would be a catastrophic out-
break in institutional settings. First, we must 
release as many people as we can, starting 
with those who are most vulnerable to con-
tracting COVID–19, such as people who are 
age 50 and over and people with medical con-
ditions. The criminal justice and immigration

detention systems have a broad menu of alter-
natives to detention to facilitate release—we 
have a duty to use them. Second, for those 
who remain in custody, these facilities must do 
the essential work to prevent the spread of 
COVID–19 in close consultation with public 
health officials. 
I am proud of House Democrats who fought 
very hard to include many of these protections 
and issues in our House bill. It is unfortunate 
that Republicans fought us on so much. How-
ever, at the end of the day, this is still a bold, 
bipartisan, and urgently necessary bill to de-
liver critically timed relief to individuals, fami-
lies, businesses, and communities across the 
country who are suffering and I am proud to 
cast my vote for its passage. This is a crisis 
of epic proportions and we must continue to 
do everything we can to respond with the 
scale sufficient to address the suffering of 
people across our country. I am also proud to 
represent a district and a state that has re-
sponded with so much compassion, caring, 
and commitment, and I will continue to fight 
for all my constituents as we weather this to-
gether.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, it is not lost on me 
how consequential the Coronavirus Aid, Relief 
and Economic Security (CARES) Act is for our 
nation. 
Along with many of my colleagues, I wish I 
could be there in person to voice my support 
for this historically massive and wide-reaching 
legislation. The absence of Members from our 
chamber doesn’t make the House of Rep-
resentatives any less united in our support of 
this significant relief package for the American 
people, who are greatly suffering by no fault of 
their own due to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The natural disaster caused by COVID–19 
is unlike any other our nation has encountered 
in modern history. Its impact is severely felt 
across the whole of society—causing an un-
precedented strain on our public health de-
fenders and medical providers as well as 
sharp economic losses and unexpected dis-
ruptions for Americans of all stripes. 
Hardworking Americans, families, commu-
nities, small businesses and numerous indus-
tries have been hit hard and fast in a matter 
of days and weeks. Given the enormous 
scope of this disaster, its consequences and 
the damage already done, it is critically impor-
tant to get help to those Americans facing dif-
ficult times. I am encouraged that the CARES 
Act extends a much needed helping hand. 
To help individuals and families weather this 
storm, the CARES Act provides financial as-
sistance in the form of direct cash payments 
and unemployment support. The legislation 
provides unprecedented help to sustain small 
businesses and their workers, after many busi-
nesses on Main Street have been forced to 
close their doors to comply with the guidance 
and orders from federal, state, local and tribal 
officials. 
For our health workers fighting on the front 
lines across the nation, this relief package re-
plenishes vital medical supplies like masks, 
respirators and other equipment. Moreover, it 
provides reinforcement supplies and resources 
for state and local response efforts. 
Finally, I worked very hard to ensure tribal 
nations are equipped to face and fight the un-
known challenges ahead with this coronavirus 
like other state and local authorities. Okla-
homa is home to 39 sovereign tribes, and 
each one plays an invaluable role in the lives 
and health of their members and surrounding 
communities. I am proud that this relief pack-
age dedicates generous resources specifically 
for tribal nations to respond. 
Therefore, had I been present, I would vote 
‘‘yea’’ if there was a recorded vote.

SPEECH OF 
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, as we 
prepared to appropriate supplemental funding 
for Indian Country through the Bureau of In-
dian Affairs budget, my colleagues and I be-
came keenly aware of the need to mitigate the 
hardships that this pandemic has caused for 
Tribal governments who have to rely on busi-
ness revenues—rather than taxes—to fund es-
sential services for their Tribal members. In 
addition, Tribal governments are often the 
largest employers on reservations, where un-
employment rates are already significantly 
higher than the rest of the country. 
For these reasons, this bill directs that not 
less than $400 million—nearly 90 percent of 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs supplemental ap-
propriation—shall be made available to meet 
the direct needs of Tribes. For these same 
reasons, this bill directs that not less than 
$450 million of the Indian Health Service sup-
plemental appropriation be distributed to di-
rectly operated programs and to Tribes and 
Tribal organizations by utilizing existing con-
tracts, compacts, and other agreements to 
speed up the process. 
In addition, I was pleased to see and sup-
port an additional $8 billion for payments to 
Tribal governments through the Coronavirus 
Relief Fund in this bill. Because of the Federal 
Government’s unique government-to-govern-
ment relationship with Indian Tribes, providing 
these funds to Tribes directly—rather than 
through the States—is the right approach. It is 
critical that the Secretaries of the Treasury 
and the Interior consult with Tribal leaders im-
mediately to determine the most expeditious, 
transparent, and fair method of allocating 
these funds.

Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, it is the intent of 
this chamber that States, Tribal governments, 
and local units of governments use the funds 
in the Coronavirus Relief Fund to recover any 
necessary monies that they would have other-
wise collected or generated in order to pay 
their employees and cover costs but for the 
COVID–19 pandemic. As the legislation indi-
cates, these funds are specifically targeted to-
wards expenditures incurred between March 
1, 2020 and December 30, 2020. I agree that 
it is important to try to keep American workers 
employed and paid during this time. And, I 
agree with the assessment that these govern-
ments rely on the collection of taxes and gen-
eration of revenues to pay the wages of these 
employees, and those costs were an antici-
pated expenditure to be allowable under the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund.

SPEECH OF 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, the House 
considered the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act. I would vote 
YEA on this important measure. 
As the coronavirus spreads throughout our 
country, the devastating impact of this pan-
demic becomes clearer each day. The bipar-
tisan CARES Act makes an important down 
payment on needed economic relief for Ameri-
cans and their families, especially in Cali-
fornia. It provides critical cash assistance to 
people who need it. It grants crucial resources 
to small businesses, helps prevent layoffs, and 
delivers urgently needed funds to hospitals, 
schools, and local governments. 
This bill is huge, by any measure. It will pro-
vide critical assistance. I am proud of the tire-
less efforts by House Democrats to secure the 
best possible deal for working families, and 
proud that we can reach a bipartisan agree-
ment. 
We simply cannot afford to declare victory, 
though. More will be needed. We’re just begin-
ning to understand the full scope of the im-
pacts. 
This is the third relief bill Congress will pass 
related to the coronavirus outbreak, and while 
they have each been critical in helping us in 
this fight, we know they are just first steps. 
Many families, workers, small businesses, first 
responders, and health care professionals will 
need more assistance, and we are already 
working on additional help to address this un-
precedented public health threat. 
The American people need and deserve a 
coordinated, fully-funded, whole-of-government 
response to keep them and their loved ones 
safe from the coronavirus epidemic, and to 
protect our economy. I will continue to work 
relentlessly to put families, workers, and small 
businesses first.

SPEECH OF 
HON. ANN WAGNER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I care deeply 
about the health of our citizens and our econ-
omy. We are in the midst of a National Emer-
gency that has taken lives, disrupted the econ-
omy, and threatened the health and economic 
security of our nation. Americans have called 
on Congress to pass legislation that provides 
relief, and we cannot let another day go by 
without answering that call. While this bill is 
not perfect, and I disagree with a number of 
specific provisions within, unprecedented cri-
ses demand unprecedented solutions, and I 
am confident the CARES Act as a whole will 
assist Missourians and Americans around the 
country in our time of need. 
COVID–19 has prevented too many Ameri-
cans from working to support their families, 
and could overwhelm our heroic health care 
workers and other first responders. I have 
worked day and night with my colleagues in 
Congress and our state and local officials to 
find a way to get people back on their feet. 
Just days ago partisanship threatened to de-
stroy all of that work, abandoning the people 
who need this assistance most. But I am 
grateful that Leader MCCONNELL was able to 
get a historic and unanimous vote in support 
through the Senate, and that Speaker PELOSI 
and Senator SCHUMER finally realized they 
needed to put politics aside and join us in 
placing our countrymen and women above 
petty political fights. 
Americans are resilient and, although these 
are difficult times, I have faith we will emerge 
stronger as a nation, a people, and an econ-
omy. The CARES Act will help Missourians 
get back to work, keep businesses open, and 
allow our economy to rebound. This legislation 
gives financial support directly to families and 
workers who need it most and provides assist-
ance to struggling small businesses so they 
can keep their doors open and pay their em-
ployees. If you have lost your job, unemploy-
ment insurance has been expanded so you 
can feed your family and keep a roof over 
your heads during this uncertain time, and this 
was done in a temporary fashion so we do not 
disincentivize people from working. Our health 
care workers and first responders who have 
worked long hours on the front lines of this cri-
sis will receive vital personal protective equip-
ment and other resources to keep up the fight. 
This is an extraordinary piece of legislation, 
but the work doesn’t stop here. Congress will 
keep working to improve upon this legislation, 
mitigate the effects of this pandemic, and en-
sure the safety of the American people. 
I am disappointed that Democrats insisted 
on adding many extraneous provisions that 
are not relevant to the crisis at hand. Millions 
of dollars for forest research and other items 
do not belong in urgent coronavirus relief leg-
islation. I am also extremely concerned they 
insisted on including over $1 billion for Amtrak 
and $10 billion for the Postal Service. We can 
have a reasoned debate on these items, but 
in another forum. The issue at hand is reliev-
ing our distressed families and small busi-
nesses, not trying to tack on political pet 
projects when so many people across America 
need our help. We are in a National Emer-
gency and it is shameful Democrats tried to 
force through partisan issues, including ag-
gressive union mandates and taxpayer funded 
abortion. I fought these provisions and am 
grateful they were ultimately left out of the 
final bill.

March 31, 2020 
We are battling an unprecedented global cri-
sis, and it calls for an unprecedented re-
sponse. While no legislation is perfect, I’m 
glad Congress could come together to send 
this package to the President’s desk to quickly 
deliver the relief our country desperately 
needs. 
The CARES Act will provide families with 
immediate support by putting cash in their 
pockets. It will protect Americans’ livelihoods 
by keeping workers employed and helping 
businesses stay afloat to ensure American 
workers have jobs to come back to. This pack-
age stands up for our heroes fighting on the 
frontlines by ensuring our nurses, doctors, and 
countless health care professionals have the 
resources they need to continue saving lives. 
When faced with a challenge, America al-
ways rises to the occasion. I’m proud of the 
way our country has rallied together to support 
one another in the face of this crisis, and I’m 
proud we can finally deliver the quick relief 
Americans have been asking for. We will beat 
this virus, and our nation will emerge stronger 
than ever before.

SPEECH OF 
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, through no fault 
of their own, hospitals, families, and busi-
nesses are facing a public health crisis caus-
ing unprecedented hardships for millions of 
employees and families. In the 3rd District, I 
have heard from heartbroken families who 
don’t know how to afford next month’s rent, 
small business owners who don’t know how 
they will pay their loyal employees or if they 
will be able to hold out and reopen their doors 
ever again, and healthcare workers desperate 
for more medical supplies. I applaud President 
Trump and the Senate for focusing on the dire 
and urgent needs of hospitals, families, and 
small businesses affected by COVID–19 and 
standing firm against loading this bill with rad-
ical leftist gimmicks that were included in 
Speaker PELOSI’s unserious legislation. I am 
obviously deeply cautious about the stag-
gering cost, but the cost of inaction today 
means putting a price tag on lives tomorrow. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the 
President in doing what is necessary to sup-
port the American people and position our 
economy to make a strong recovery once we 
defeat this terrible virus.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act. 
This $2 trillion legislation—the largest aid 
package in American history—is shaped to 
help meet the great challenges we face during 
this crisis. 
As Americans stay home to slow the spread 
of the deadly coronavirus, the economy has 
ground to a halt. Nearly 3.3 million Americans 
filed unemployment claims last week, an all- 
time record. Our frontline health care workers 
are working around the clock to care for the 
tens of thousands of Americans who have 
contracted the virus, requiring a surge of hos-
pital beds, masks, personal protective equip-
ment, and ventilators to safely care for the 
sick. 
The Democratic House has led the way to 
respond to this emergency. At the beginning 
of March, we passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion 
funding package to strengthen our nation’s 
public health response to the coronavirus. A 
week later, we passed another bipartisan bill, 
the Families First Act to provide paid sick 
leave and nutrition assistance to working fami-
lies, as well as free coronavirus testing to any-
one who needs it. 
Today’s legislation continues Congress’s 
fast-moving bipartisan emergency response to 
the pandemic. Democrats fought successfully 
to flip the original Senate bill from a trickle- 
down, corporation-first approach to a families 
and workers-first approach. 
The four major pillars of the legislation are: 
A ‘‘Marshall Plan’’ for our Health Care System, 
Expanded Unemployment Benefits and Direct 
Cash Assistance for Americans, Assistance for 
Small Businesses, Relief for state, tribal, and 
local governments. 
A $150 billion ‘‘Marshall Plan’’ for our health 
systems with funding to hospitals and other 
health providers to buy protective equipment, 
testing supplies, new construction, and to 
cover unreimbursed costs or lost revenue. 
Funding is also provided to increase the sup-
ply of health care equipment in the Strategic 
National Stockpile, implement the Defense 
Production Act, and boost FEMA’s Disaster 
Relief Fund. 
$260 billion for unemployment insurance, 
providing an additional $600 weekly for every 
American receiving unemployment benefits. 
Many Americans will also receive a one-time 
cash payment of up to $1,200, and $500 per 
child. 
A $350 billion small business rescue plan 
that provides loan forgiveness grants to small 
businesses to keep their workers on payroll 
and help to pay rent and utility bills. Coverage 
also goes to independent contractors, gig 
workers, and nonprofits. 
A $150 billion relief fund to assist state, 
local, and tribal governments maintain essen-
tial public services for their residents. 
Democrats also successfully prevented se-
cret corporate bailouts. Thanks to a strong 
Democratic effort, corporations that receive aid 
must use it to keep workers on their payrolls. 
They’re prohibited from giving bonuses to ex-
ecutives, exercise buyback of stocks, or give 
dividends to shareholders. We launched many 
attempts to remove the $500 billion fund under 
the control of the Secretary of the Treasury, 
but we were unable to do so because of the 
support of Senator MITCH MCCONNELL and the 
White House. What we were able to secure is 
an Inspector General to oversee the funds to 
ensure transparency and accountability, and a 
Board to do so as well. 
Finally, the legislation includes $100 billion 
in emergency appropriations for education, 
childcare, housing, and homelessness, as well 
as grants for states to prepare for the upcom-
ing election in November. 
Taken together, this legislation will go a long 
way to help workers, families, small busi-
nesses, state and local governments, hos-
pitals, and health care workers, and California 
will receive approximately $15 billion from the 
legislation. 
Congress’s work to respond to the pan-
demic is not complete, and the House is al-
ready working on a fourth package to help our 
nation during these critical times. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
this legislation to come to the aid of the Amer-
ican people during this time of crisis. They de-
serve swift action by a united Congress.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I add my voice in 
support of the CARES Act. 
This sweeping, bipartisan legislation is the 
work of a Congress that soberly understands 
the gravity of the emergency facing our nation. 
It is only because Congress has set aside par-
tisanship and disagreements that I am able to 
say, help, my friends, is on the way. 
For the 3.3 million who filed for unemploy-
ment last week and the millions more who 
have not yet been able to navigate states’ 
overwhelmed unemployment servers, this new 
law will provide an additional $600 per week 
in Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. 
I fought for this $15 per hour living wage to 
give a hand to the servers, bartenders, and 
other tipped employees that are the backbone 
of Florida’s tourism and services sector. 
The law provides a $1200 check to all 
Americans, including those on Social Security, 
who make less than $75,000. 
It includes a $100 billion ‘‘Marshall Plan’’ for 
our hospitals and public health system and 
$150 billion for states and tribes. 
It provides over $350 billion for small busi-
nesses on Main Street in grants, forgivable 
loans, and tax credits so they can make pay-
roll and pay monthly bills to keep their busi-
nesses afloat. 
The new law provides 6 months relief for 
federal student loan payments, blocks evic-
tions for 150 days, blocks foreclosures for 60 
days, and offers mortgage forbearance for up 
to 6 months—all penalty-free. No interest, 
fees, or negative information on your credit re-
port. 
This bill is neither perfect nor the last word. 
As this crisis unfolds and America rises to 
face unthinkable challenges, so too must their 
Representatives in Congress. 
We need more masks, protective equip-
ment, and ventilators. And we need testing ev-
erywhere. 
We need more help for our cities like St. 
Petersburg, Clearwater, Largo, and Pinellas 
Park. 
We need to do more for essential employ-
ees—the grocery store checkers, truck drivers, 
farmers, 
sanitation 
workers, 
pharmacists, 
cooks, home care workers, and delivery work-
ers that are enabling the rest of us to shelter-

more than our thanks. They deserve child 
care, overtime, and hazard pay. 
Finally, but of the highest priority, we need 
to do all we can for doctors, nurses, and other 
frontline healthcare workers—those risking it 
all to save lives. They are the true heroes of 
this pandemic. Angels, not with wings but with 
masks and protective gowns. You have our 
undying gratitude. 
Never in any of our lifetimes has America 
stared down an enemy so insidious and so 
devastating. But we will answer this call of his-
tory with courage and resolve. We must.

bless. We will get through this. We’re all in 
this together.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to support the Senate Amendment to H.R. 
748, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security Act. This bill will provide emer-
gency relief to millions of Americans as we 
fight the coronavirus outbreak. 
I want to highlight Title VI, which establishes 
a Coronavirus Relief Fund that provides $150 
billion for the Secretary of Treasury to dis-
seminate to States, Tribal Governments and 
units of local government in fiscal year 2020. 
Tragically, in recent days I’ve heard from 
many tribal nations in California, and they are 
really struggling. That’s because they did the 
right thing to help our country combat this 
virus by closing their businesses. 
It is worth noting that they did so proactively 
and were under no obligation to take such 
drastic steps. But, as we have come to expect 
from our leaders in the tribal community, they 
did the right thing because it was the right 
thing to do. 
These closures have been nothing short of 
catastrophic. The very resources that had 
been used to fund the tribal government and 
provide services virtually evaporated over-
night. These governments run, for the most 
part, on these tribal funds. The funds provided 
by the federal government via the Indian 
Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs, and other federal programs, often only 
make up a very small percentage of the total 
cost of running Tribal governments. So, when 
these businesses closed, the Tribes knew that 
doing so would compromise their ability to 
serve their people during this time of crisis. 
I heard these stories and knew that Con-
gress had to respond. This $8 billion fund will 
address the decrease in revenues, and we 
have mandated that the Secretary of Treasury 
work with the Secretary of Interior, to make 
sure that these decreased revenues are into 
their determination when making funds avail-
able to tribes. 
MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I will vote in 
support of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 
748, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security (CARES) Act. This economic 
stimulus represents a wartime level investment 
in our nation as we continue our fight against 
an invisible enemy: COVID–19. 
Public 
health experts agree the con-
sequences of the virus will only get more dev-
astating in the coming days. People we know 
and love will get sick. People we know and 
love may die despite the heroic efforts of our 
health care workers who are on the front lines, 
sacrificing the health of themselves and their 
families to give their neighbors and commu-
nities a fighting chance. 
We also know that the financial fall-out from 
this crisis is unprecedented. On Thursday, the 
Department of Labor announced that nearly 
3.3 million people lost their job the prior week, 
an unfortunate record number of claims. 
Through no fault of their own, millions of 
Americans were sidelined by a vicious virus 
that has brought our economy to a stunning 
but necessary halt as we work to ‘‘flatten the 
curve’’ to protect our health and safety. 
Our next steps in this battle—to both con-
tain the virus and prevent further layoffs—are 
critical. 
And while Members of Congress can’t be 
the experts in the lab developing a vaccine, or 
flying the cargo planes with medical supplies, 
there is something we can do today: get des-
perately needed funding and medical supplies 
to hospitals and frontline healthcare workers, 
and provide critical relief to the millions of laid- 
off workers and small business owners who 
are hurting right now. 
Now, without question, the bill the Senate 
sent us isn’t perfect. 
Remember, the Republican starting point 
was a massive corporate slush fund with no 
transparency, accountability, or worker protec-
tions. 
But we could not allow a repeat of the failed 
bailout of 2008. I’m proud to be part of the 
Democratic negotiating team that protected 
jobs because we know that putting working 
people and families first is how we as a coun-
try can get back on our feet. Prioritizing their 
needs over the profits of giant corporations is 
how we build an economy that works for ev-
eryone—not just a wealthy few. 
This bill will put checks in the mail to 80 
percent of Americans who make under six fig-
ures, and it will boost critical benefits for any-
one who lost their job amid this crisis. 
We fought hard so this bill will ensure mil-
lions of bus drivers, train operators, railroad 
workers, flight crews, airline ground workers, 
airport workers, and more not only remain on 
the job but keep as many of their hard-earned 
health and retirement benefits as possible dur-
ing this crisis. The relief in this package flows 
to workers first, not last—and it makes clear to 
any industry getting relief: no stock buybacks, 
no executive giveaways, no layoffs. Workers 
first—period. 
For the millions who have lost their jobs 
through no fault of their own, this legislation 
vastly strengthens and makes critical reforms 
to Unemployment Insurance programs—ensur-
ing 100 percent wage replacement for the av-
erage American worker struggling without a 
paycheck during this crisis. It also provides 
federal incentives for states to eliminate wait-
ing week requirements, expands access to 
part-time, self-employed, and gig economy 
workers, and adds an additional 13 weeks of 
federally-funded UI benefits. 
To support the many small businesses 
across the country that have been forced to 
shutter, the bill designates $350 billion worth 
of 100 percent guaranteed SBA loans, a por-
tion of which SBA will be able to forgive. 
These loans will be up to $10 million and pro-
vide incentives to keep employees on the pay-
roll and pay them at their regular salary levels. 
For our state, local, and tribal governments, 
this legislation establishes a $150 billion 
Coronavirus Relief Fund so that they have 
desperately needed additional funding to build 
field hospitals, buy ventilators and other per-
sonal protective equipment (PPE), as well as 
offset the cost of other essential government 
services not budgeted in the wake of the eco-
nomic downturn. While this fund is a good 
start, we must do more to ensure our local-
ities, especially those in rural areas, have 
what they need in this fight. 
It allows for the temporary suspension of ex-
cise taxes on spirits for those used in the pro-
duction of hand sanitizer in compliance with 
guidance from the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA), like Swallowtail and Thinking Tree 
Spirits in my district in Oregon. 
The CARES Act provides $1 billion for the 
Defense Production Act, allowing the Depart-
ment of Defense to invest in the manufac-
turing of PPE and other critical medical equip-
ment in short supply. While this isn’t the $3.5 
billion allocated for the DPA in the House bill, 
it is still a notable sum to ramp up production 
for PPE and other supplies. 
The President should have unleased the full 
power of the Defense Production Act (DPA) 
weeks ago. He still hasn’t, and his lack of 
leadership means health care workers and 
their patients are suffering because there are 
not enough ventilators, PPE, or other medical 
supplies. I am continuing to call on the Presi-
dent to immediately ramp up domestic produc-
tion of these crucial supplies. 
This legislation also provides much-needed 
help to hospitals and healthcare providers by 
allocating $100 billion to cover unreimbursed 
health care-related expenses and lost reve-
nues attributable to COVID–19. It also in-
creases Medicare reimbursement for treatment 
of inpatient COVID–19 patients by 20 percent, 
and it allocates more than $27 billion for the 
Biomedical Advanced Research and Develop-
ment Authority, investing billions into vaccines 
and therapeutics and $16 billion into the Stra-
tegic National Stockpile (SNS). 
It mandates all private insurance plans to 
cover testing for COVID–19 without cost-shar-
ing and provides free coverage for a COVID– 
19 vaccine or other preventive service within 
15 days. It also protects the uninsured by al-
lowing them to receive a coronavirus test and 
related services with no cost-sharing in any 
state Medicaid program that elects to offer 
such an enrollment option. 
To protect and bolster our frontline health 
care workers, rural providers, and the health 
care of those with most need, the bill invests 
$1.32 billion in supplemental funding for Com-
munity Health Centers; reauthorizes Human

(HRSA) grant programs; reauthorizes HRSA 
grants to strengthen rural community health; 
expands telehealth capabilities; grants liability 
protections to doctors who provide volunteer 
medical services; and establishes a Ready 
Reserve Corps to ensure there are enough 
trained doctors and nurses to respond to 
COVID–19 throughout our country. 
To protect our students and schools, this 
package provides $30.75 billion for an Edu-
cation Stabilization Fund for states, school dis-
tricts, and institutions of higher education 
(IHEs) for COVID–19 costs. $13.5 billion will 
ultimately be distributed to local education 
agencies to use for coronavirus response ac-
tivities. $14.25 billion will be used for higher 
education emergency relief to help defray 
costs, such as lost revenue, to support social 
distancing and distance education, and to 
issue emergency grants to impacted students 
for food, housing, course materials, tech, and 
healthcare and childcare. 
The package also bolsters programs that 
America’s families depend on by: providing bil-
lions for childcare programs such as Head 
Start and the Child Care Development Block 
Grant, strengthening the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program through billions in ad-
ditional funding, providing millions for utility as-
sistance through the Low-Income Home En-
ergy Assistance Program, and extending the 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
(TANF) program. 
In a bid to keep Americans housed during 
this crisis, the CARES Act institutes a morato-
rium on evictions and foreclosures for renters 
and homeowners in federally subsidized hous-
ing. The bill also provides $4 billion in Emer-
gency Solution Grants and $3 billion in rental 
assistance to help those most at-risk of home-
lessness or who have already become home-
less. It also provides $5 billion for the Commu-
nity Development Block Grant to enable nearly 
1,240 states, counties, and cities to rapidly re-
spond to COVID–19 and the economic and 
housing impacts caused by it. 
The investments this bill makes are critical, 
they are bipartisan, and they are desperately 
needed. 
However, there are areas where the legisla-
tion falls short. 
The bill fails to help the U.S. Postal Service 
and its millions of employees—employees who 
are ensuring medicine and supplies are deliv-
ered for those staying at home. In protecting 
our public Postal Service, the bill fails utterly— 
providing a $10 billion line of credit with oner-
ous terms and conditions of accessing said 
credit set by the Treasury Secretary. There 
are reports noting the Postal Service may 
cease operations by June because of lack of 
funds. The House bill included $20 billion for 
the Postal Service in lost revenues due to 
COVID–19 impacts, forgave their current debt 
to the Treasury, and opened up a $15 billion 
line of credit should they need to access it. I 
will work with my colleagues to make sure the 
needs of the Postal Service are addressed in 
future COVID–19 response packages. We all 
depend on it now more than ever. We can and 
must do more to help our Postal Service. 
Issuing a moratorium on evictions and fore-
closures in federally assisted housing was a 
great first step, but more must be done to en-
sure that Americans are able to keep their 
homes while our current crisis rages on. We 
must provide relief to renters and homeowners 
in the commercial market. I am calling for a 
national moratorium on mortgage payments, 
rental payments, eviction filings, and fore-
closures. We can and must do more to help 
Americans stay housed. 
The House proposal was far superior in pro-
viding relief to the millions of students and stu-
dent loan borrowers who are being profoundly 
hurt by the crisis. Democrats proposed paying 
$10,000 of every student loan borrower’s cur-
rent balance and would have directed the 
Treasury to cover monthly payments for pri-
vate borrowers for the span of the crisis. We 
can and must do more to help student loan 
borrowers. 
As public health experts recommend drastic 
social distancing measures, House Democrats 
took steps to protect the integrity of our elec-
tions and the health of the people by fighting 
for a national, no-excuse, prepaid, vote-by- 
mail guarantee. This provision was not in-
cluded in the Senate package. We can and 
must do more to protect the integrity of our 
2020 elections. 
To help Americans keep food on the table, 
House Democrats proposed raising the min-
imum SNAP benefit from $18 to $30 and 
blocked the Trump administration from imple-
menting harmful guidelines that could kick 3 
million people off of SNAP—even while our 
nation reels from the economic fallout of the 
COVID–19 outbreak. SNAP works—we al-
ready know every $1 spent generates $1.70 in 
economic activity. Sadly, these provisions 
were not included in the CARES Act. We can 
and must do more to keep Americans fed. 
While I also applaud the extension of nu-
merous crucial healthcare programs in this bill, 
which were set to expire on May 22, we can’t 
forget that these extensions will delay needed 
debate and reforms on enormously important 
issues like prescription drug costs and sur-
prise billing. These issues long plagued our 
broken healthcare system before COVID–19, 
and they will continue to do so once we beat 
this virus. I look forward to finally addressing 
these long-overdue issues once this crisis is 
over. 
But such is the nature of compromise. In di-
vided government, you don’t always get what 
you fight for. But that does not mean you stop 
fighting. 
This CARES Act, with all its flaws, is triage: 
keep workers on the job and avoid economic 
collapse. 
Beyond addressing some of these short-
comings I’ve mentioned, our next step is re-
covery and rehabilitation—a true stimulus that 
creates jobs and rebuilds our decaying infra-
structure. In the coming days and weeks, I will 
double down on an infrastructure package that 
repairs the breach left by years of neglect— 
that rebuilds failing bridges, restores crumbling 
highways, and puts people to work on projects 
with jobs that cannot be exported. 
But let me be absolutely clear—we have a 
long way to go to address what truly ails the 
United States economy: corporate greed. 
COVID–19 is the virus we are battling right 
now, but our economy has been sick for a 
very long time. 
Corporate greed, Wall Street demands that 
consistently puts profits over people, nearly 2 
trillion dollars in Trump tax cuts that went 
straight to the top—all of that is symptomatic 
of a system that for far too long has kept 
working people down even as the stock mar-
ket soared. 
We need a system that always puts workers 
and families first—not just during a national 
emergency and not just when it’s politically 
convenient. 
I’ll always be ready to roll up my sleeves for 
that fight.

TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, a key part of the 
relief package was the tribal government sta-
bilization fund. This fund would be used by 
tribal governments to offset the dramatic 
losses they are facing at this time. This fund-
ing would be used to help them continue to do 
the right thing and keep their employees on 
the job—paid, and supported—as our nation 
responds to, and recovers from the pandemic. 
Title 
VI, 
Sec. 
601(c)(7) 
provides 
$8,000,000,000 in relief to tribal governments 
for losses of revenues and increased expendi-
tures associated with COVID–19. The bill pro-
vides: 
[T]he amount paid under this section for 
fiscal year 2020 to a Tribal government shall 
be the amount the Secretary shall deter-
mine, in consultation with the Secretary of 
the Interior and Indian Tribes, that is based 
on increased expenditures of each such Trib-
al government (or a tribally-owned entity of 
such Tribal government) relative to aggre-
gate expenditures in fiscal year 2019 by the 
Tribal government (or tribally-owned entity) 
and determined in such manner as the Sec-
retary determines appropriate to ensure that 
all 
amounts 
available 
under 
subsection 
(a)(2)(B) for fiscal year 2020 are distributed to 
Tribal governments. 
Tribal governments or tribally-owned entities 
can demonstrate ‘‘increased expenditures’’ rel-
ative to 2019 by listing expenditures associ-
ated with the closure or diminished operation 
of business and government facilities, includ-
ing payments made to employees or other en-
tities while businesses or government oper-
ations are closed or operating in a limited ca-
pacity, as well as the difference in revenues 
transferred to tribal government accounts in 
2020 versus the same period in 2019.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, as the Amer-
ican people do their part to stop the spread of 
coronavirus, they’ve made enormous personal 
sacrifices on behalf of the entire country’s 
health and safety. Over the past few weeks, 
this deadly pandemic has taken over 1,000 
lives in the United States and infected tens of 
thousands more, with a negative ripple effect 
plaguing nearly every family and individual to 
some degree. 
During this time, I’ve heard from business 
owners in Northeast Texas who are worried

about how they’ll pay their employees and the 
possibility of being forced to close up shop for 
good. I’ve heard from mothers and fathers 
who are unable to bring paychecks home to 
feed their children. I’ve heard from health care 
providers who are struggling to gain access to 
the medical equipment they need to treat the 
patients exposed to this highly infectious dis-
ease. They asked for their elected representa-
tive to step up to the plate and help. 
It’s no secret that I don’t ordinarily support 
sweeping legislative packages that cost tril-
lions of dollars. But this pandemic presents us 
with dire and sweeping circumstances on a 
level I hope we’ll never have to face again in 
our lifetime. Due to the gravity of situation that 
the coronavirus pandemic has placed us in, I 
support the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security Act. While this bill is certainly 
far from perfect, it contains critical relief for the 
people I represent in Northeast Texas and 
throughout the country, which will help ensure 
we successfully defeat this invisible enemy in 
the days, weeks and months ahead. 
I’m grateful this critical legislation will finally 
head to President Trump’s desk. Let’s get the 
American people the relief they need, as we 
continue fighting this battle together.

SPEECH OF 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, as of the time 
of this debate, there are 6,876 positive 
COVID–19 cases in New Jersey. And trag-
ically 81 individuals in our state have lost their 
lives. These are friends, family and loved 
ones. This virus has touched each and every 
one of us. I grieve for all the lives lost and for 
those who are fighting tooth and nail to beat 
this nasty virus. Our front lines are staffed with 
brave first responders and health care workers 
doing their best to help those impacted. 
Across my state, we are hard at work making 
sure those who need a test are getting tested 
and we have expanded bed capacity to care 
for those in need. The coming weeks will be 
hard for all. And I remain ready and willing to 
do everything I can for our state and country. 
I 
rise 
today 
because 
I 
support 
the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act because it provides imme-
diate and needed assistance for workers, fam-
ilies, small businesses and hospitals across 
our country weathering the COVID–19 crisis. 
Democrats stood strong against the partisan, 
corporate-focused bail out prioritized by Sen-
ate Republicans. Through tough negotiations, 
we secured payments of as much as $1,200 
for individual taxpayers and $500 per child. 
Democrats also secured expanded unemploy-
ment insurance for any worker affected by 
COVID–19, including an additional $600 a 
week in additional and expanded benefits and 
protections for self-employed and nonprofits. 
And we guaranteed inclusion of $150 billion to 
help states and territories respond to this cri-
sis. After I led a letter signed by over 100 
members of Congress, first responders will re-
ceive nearly $1 billion in federal assistance to 
help purchase needed personal protective 
equipment. Our hospitals and providers, who 
stand on the frontlines of this pandemic, will 
receive $100 billion in funding to reimburse for 
COVID–19 related costs. This was a top pri-
ority for our state’s delegation, which stood 
united demanding this relief. But I know it is 
not enough. I will keep fighting for more aid for 
our first responders, for our hurting small busi-
ness owners, and for the millions of Ameri-
cans being pummeled by this terrible time. 
Like millions of Americans across the coun-
try, I am practicing safe social distancing 
measures by working from home. I am con-
necting everyday with my constituents and 
local, state, and federal officials making sure 
New Jersey’s voice is being represented and 
our needs are being met. I support this relief 
legislation for our nation. Talk has already 
begun about what to do next, and I am fully 
focused on making sure New Jersey gets its 
due.

HONORING JOSEPH LOWERY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 31, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a re-
markable leader and civil rights activist, Mr. 
Joseph Lowery. 
Mr. Joseph Echols Lowery was born to 
Leroy and Dora Lowery on October 6, 1921, 
in Huntsville, Alabama. At age 11, Lowery was 
abused by a white police officer for not step-
ping off the sidewalk as a white man passed 
by. From there, his parents sent him to Chi-
cago, Illinois, to stay with family and attend 
junior high. He later returned to his hometown 
to complete his secondary education at Wil-
liam Hooper Council High School. Lowery at-
tended Knoxville College, Alabama A&M Col-
lege, and concluded at Paine College. He also 
attended ministerial training at Payne Theo-
logical Seminary and completed a Doctor of 
Divinity degree at the Chicago Ecumenical In-
stitute. 
From 1952 to 1961, Lowery pastored Mo-
bile’s Warren Street Methodist Church. His 
Civil Rights career started in the early 1950’s. 
He helped lead the Montgomery bus boycott— 
headed the Alabama Civic Affairs Association. 
He founded the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference along with Martin Luther King, Jr., 
Fred Shuttlesworth, and a few others—leading 
the organization as President from 1977 to 
1997. Also, he was co-founder and President 
of the Black Leadership Forum. He served as 
the pastor of Cascade United Methodist 
Church in Atlanta from 1986 through 1992. 
In 1950, Lowery married Evelyn Gibson. 
They had three daughters together: Yvonne 
Kennedy, Karen Lowery, and Cheryl Lowery- 
Osborne. He also had two sons from an ear-
lier marriage with Agnes Moore: Joseph Jr. 
and LeRoy III. 
In 1965, Lowery participated in the Selma- 
to-Montgomery march. Atlanta’s city govern-
ment renamed Ashby Street to Joseph E. 
Lowery Boulevard which travels past Atlanta’s 
prestigious Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities: Clark Atlanta University, Spelman 
College, Morehouse College, and Morris 
Brown College. 
As a member of the esteemed brotherhood 
of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated, 
Lowery received the NAACP Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award in 1997, the inaugural Walter P. 
Reuther Humanitarian Award from Wayne 
State University in 2003, the Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Center Peace Award, and the Na-
tional Urban League’s Whitney M. Young, Jr. 
Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004. Ebony 
named him one of the 15 greatest black 
preachers. He received several honorary doc-
torates from colleges and universities, includ-
ing Dillard University, Morehouse College, Ala-
bama State University, University of Alabama 
in Huntsville, and Emory University. Lowery 
was honored at the International Civil Rights 
Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King, Jr. 
National Historic Site in Atlanta, Georgia, in 
2004. 
On January 20, 2009, Lowery delivered the 
benediction at the inauguration of Senator 
Barack Obama as the 44th President of the 
United States of America. On July 30, 2009, 
he was awarded the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom by Barack Obama. He was also 
given the Fred L. Shuttlesworth Human Rights 
Award by the Birmingham Civil Rights Insti-
tute. 
Joseph Lowery died on March 27, 2020, in 
Atlanta, Georgia, at 98 years old. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the late Mr. Joseph Echols 
Lowery for his passion and dedication to min-
istry and civil rights.

Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity Act (‘‘CARES Act’’). This bill is incredibly 
important to all of our citizens and commu-
nities. Our country is going through a war with 
this new virus, and we need to get every re-
source possible out into our communities to 
help fight this pandemic. We also need to pro-
tect our workers and keep them paid so they 
can purchase the food and supplies they need 
to get their families through this crisis safely. 
That is what I want to speak to. One of the 
last provisions added to this bill was Title VI, 
which establishes a Coronavirus Relief Fund 
that provides $150 billion for the Secretary of 
Treasury to disseminate to States, Tribal Gov-
ernments, and units of local government in fis-
cal year 2020. These funds are to alleviate se-
vere financial pressure these governments are 
under during this public health emergency. 
Specifically, the funds are intended to cover 
expenditures that were not accounted for in 
the budgets of these governments prior to the 
COVID–19 virus outbreak. For most of these 
governments, their budgets are based on the 
revenues they accounted for over the course 
of the fiscal year, including from revenues an-
ticipated to be generated from business enter-
prises. These anticipated revenues are what 
these governments use to pay the wages of 
their employees. 
I want to memorialize that it is the intent of 
this 
Chamber 
that 
the 
funds 
in 
the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund are intended to help 
cover the loss of revenues that would have 
otherwise been collected and generated by 
these governments to cover the wages of their 
employees. We need to make sure these em-
ployees continue to be paid and that every ef-
fort is made to prevent them from losing their 
jobs during this pandemic.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, America is in the 
middle of a crisis, and our constituents are 
looking to us for help. 
COVID–19 
has 
shuttered 
businesses, 
closed schools, left millions of Americans with-
out the means to pay rent or put food on their 
tables, and worst of all, killed over a thousand 
of our neighbors. 
Congress has passed two bills to address 
the stubborn lack of testing that still plagues 
our health system, and to provide Americans 
with federally guaranteed paid sick leave for 
the first time ever. 
However, it’s clear that the scope and im-
pact of this pandemic is far greater than we 
could have imagined. 
So today, we take another step towards giv-
ing Americans a helping hand and some 
needed relief from an emergency that has 
changed life as we know it. 
I support H.R. 748, the CARES Act, be-
cause it reflects a bipartisan compromise that 
will allow our elementary, secondary, and 
postsecondary schools to pay their faculty and 
staff, and continue providing nourishment to 
their students. 
I support the CARES Act because it will put 
money directly into the pockets of working 
Americans who aren’t looking for a handout, 
but who need assistance to make it through 
the next few weeks. 
I support the CARES Act because it pro-
vides billions in assistance to our number one 
job creators, our small businesses, as they 
look to make payroll and keep their workers 
employed. 
It was the author William Feather who said: 
‘‘The prizes go to those who meet emer-
gencies successfully. And the way to meet 
emergencies is to do each daily task the best 
we can.’’ 
The American people have done their best 
to meet each day of this crisis with resolve. 
Now it is up to Congress to meet this crisis 
with the same kind of moral fiber.
