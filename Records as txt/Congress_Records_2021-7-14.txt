RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
BUDGET 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, 
late last night, after a very, very, just 
amazing meeting—several-hour meet-
ing—of the Budget Committee, where 
people spoke their minds and we came 
together, last night, the Senate Demo-
cratic majority on the Budget Com-
mittee reached a landmark agreement 
on a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, 
which will pave the way for historic 
legislation later this year called the 
American Jobs and Families Plan. 
Very simply, this budget resolution 
will allow us to pass the most signifi-
cant legislation to expand support and 
help American families since the New 
Deal—since the New Deal. This is a 
generational 
and 
transformational 
change to help American families, who 
need the help in this rapidly changing 
world. 
Every major program that President 
Biden has asked for is funded in a ro-
bust way. The President will be attend-
ing the Democratic caucus lunch later 
today to talk about not only agree-
ment but the next steps along the way. 
When you consider the American Jobs 
and Families Plan, in conjunction with 
the 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
bill, 
which is close to $600 billion, you get 
$4.1 trillion, which is very, very close 
to the total amount that President 
Biden has asked Congress to invest.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4872 
July 14, 2021 
Both traditional infrastructure, like 
roads and bridges, and social infra-
structure—we mean by that things 
that help people and families directly, 
such as healthcare, family leave, and 
education—will receive the kind of sup-
port that the American people so need 
and are asking for. We are very proud 
of this plan. 
Now, we know, the road ahead is 
going to be long. There are bumps 
along the way. This is only the first 
step in a long road we will have to 
travel and must travel, but we are 
going to get this done because we so 
fervently believe that we must make 
average American lives a whole lot bet-
ter. 
We want middle-class people to be 
able to stay in the middle class and 
breathe easier in the middle class. We 
want poor people to be able to climb 
that ladder to get to the middle class. 
And nothing, nothing that has been put 
on the floor of this Senate will do that 
better than this bill. Nothing that has 
been put on the floor of the Senate for 
the last several decades will do that 
the way this bill will. It is trans-
formational. And, frankly, it is excit-
ing. 
The eventual legislation we are talk-
ing about is best understood in three 
buckets: jobs, families, climate. In-
stead of giving a giant tax break to 
large corporations and the wealthy, as 
our Republican colleagues did when 
they were in the majority, we are going 
to strengthen the backbone of the mid-
dle class by making critical invest-
ments in infrastructure, creating thou-
sands upon thousands upon thousands 
of good-paying jobs in the process with 
apprenticeships and training so that 
people who never had opportunities to 
have these jobs can get them and then 
lead good lives for decades later. 
The resolution will make sure that 
there are no tax increases for families 
under $400,000 and no tax increases for 
small businesses. This is about rebuild-
ing the middle class and creating jobs. 
And we will change our tax policy far 
different than what our Republican 
friends did. The very wealthy, the peo-
ple at the top who escaped paying all 
or a lot of taxes—no, no, no—they are 
going to pay their fair share for the 
first time in a long time, so different 
than what our Republican colleagues 
did. Their bill gave the top 1 percent a 
huge percentage, some estimated as 
high as 83 percent of the breaks. We are 
going to give it to the middle class, to 
the working people. 
For American families, we will intro-
duce paid family leave, as well as one 
important 
addition 
to 
President 
Biden’s proposal, which is a robust ex-
pansion of Medicare to cover dental, vi-
sion, and hearing. This is something 
that Chairman SANDERS, Budget Chair-
man SANDERS, has championed and 
alerted not just this Chamber but the 
Nation to its need. We are going to get 
it done. 
And on climate, we must act on cli-
mate. We have seen what is going on 
just in the last month. We are going to 
invest in green infrastructure—strong, 
bold, green infrastructure; electric ve-
hicles; clean and renewable power; re-
silient projects, housing, and more that 
will not only help our country adapt to 
a changing climate but slow climate 
change itself. 
On top of President Biden’s plans, 
Democrats will add other policies to 
significantly deal with climate, such as 
reducing methane emissions, one of the 
most potent and deadly of the green-
house gases. 
So jobs, families, climate, these are 
the three buckets that Democrats will 
be working on. 
Again, let me repeat. There is a long 
road ahead of us. But the fact that we 
were able to come together last night 
with the diverse views on the Budget 
Committee was a strong shot out of the 
gate. 
Now, I am sure my friends on the 
other side of the aisle are going to pan 
this and say one thing or another. We 
can predict they will label anything 
where we reach out to help American 
families. They don’t want to do that. 
They just want to help those wealthy 
people. They don’t want their taxes to 
rise. They don’t want the government 
to help the people, so they are going to 
criticize it and use their usual name- 
calling. That is what they have been 
doing for years, no matter what legis-
lation there is. I am quite sure they 
will raise phony concerns about the 
debt and deficit. 
Hello, my colleagues, you raised the 
deficit by $2 trillion so you can give 
tax cuts; namely, to wealthy people 
and big corporations. And now you are 
going to claim, when we want to help 
middle-class families, poor families, 
that there is a deficit? Give us and give 
the American people a break. It is hy-
pocrisy. 
The American people won’t buy their 
criticisms. Creating jobs; providing 
family leave; making education, hous-
ing, and healthcare more affordable; 
fighting climate change, no one seri-
ously believes that these policies are 
the policies on the road to what they 
might call socialism. These are what 
American people want. Paid family 
leave, helping people go to college, 
come on, that is part of our democratic 
tradition where we build ladders up. 
And I mean small ‘‘d,’’ American tradi-
tion, where we build ladders up to help 
people climb up and live a good life. 
So the goals we must pursue are 
goals to build back our middle class, 
secure our middle class, help more peo-
ple get to the middle class, to bolster 
our economy, to lay the foundation for 
another century of American pros-
perity, just as Franklin Roosevelt did 
close to 100 years ago. And that is ex-
actly what the Democratic majority is 
going to do. 
MARIJUANA 
Mr. President, now on another sub-
ject, later today, on marijuana, I will 
join my colleagues Senators Booker 
and Wyden to release draft legislation 
to reform the Federal marijuana laws, 
principally to end the prohibition on 
marijuana at the Federal level for the 
first time in several generations. 
Over the past decades, Americans’ at-
titudes toward marijuana have under-
gone a dramatic transformation. Lis-
ten to this: Nearly 70 percent of Ameri-
cans support legalizing adult use of 
marijuana—70. Eighteen States, plus 
DC, have passed laws on adult use of 
marijuana. Thirty-seven States and DC 
have legalized marijuana for medical 
use. 
The States are supposed to be our 
laboratory for democracy, and by all 
accounts, these experiments have been 
a success. The doom-and-gloom pre-
dictions of the naysayers—oh, crime 
will go way up, drug use will go all the 
way up—have never, never material-
ized. I note that a State like South Da-
kota had it on its ballot in the last 
election. In that conservative State, 
the majority people voted in the same 
direction that we are talking about 
here. 
For decades, for decades, young men 
and young women, disproportionately 
young Black and Hispanic men and 
women have been arrested and jailed 
for even carrying a small amount of 
marijuana in their pocket, a charge 
that often came with exorbitant pen-
alties and a serious criminal record be-
cause of the overcriminalization of 
marijuana, and it followed them for the 
remainder of their lives. It makes no 
sense, and it is time for change. 
Now is the time for Congress to en-
gage in this debate, update our Federal 
laws to not only reflect popular wis-
dom but science. Marijuana, amazingly 
in this 21st century, is still treated by 
Federal law with the same hostility as 
heroin, despite it being far, far less 
dangerous. 
So I greatly look forward to releasing 
this draft legislation with my col-
leagues Senators Wyden and Booker 
today. We will speak about how our bill 
will address the issues relating to up-
dating our Federal marijuana laws, not 
just ending the Federal prohibition, 
but how it will ensure restorative jus-
tice, protect public health, and imple-
ment responsible taxes and regula-
tions. 
NOMINATION OF MYRNA PEREZ 
Mr. President, on a final matter, 
Myrna Perez. In a moment, I am ex-
cited to head over to the Judiciary 
Committee 
to 
introduce 
an 
out-
standing nominee for one of the most 
important courts in the country, the 
Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New 
York. And the person I will introduce 
is Myrna Perez, one of the foremost 
election lawyers in the country. 
The 
daughter 
of 
Mexican 
immi-
grants, Myrna graduated from Yale, 
Harvard, and Columbia Law School be-
fore joining the Brennan Center for 
Justice as a voting rights and election 
litigator. The Federal bench has long 
been occupied by former prosecutors 
and corporate lawyers. It is about time 
that civil rights attorneys, Federal de-
fenders, and voting rights experts, like

July 14, 2021 
Myrna Perez, one of the foremost vot-
ing experts in the country, join the 
ranks. 
Especially now, when our democracy 
is in peril in many ways, it is crucial 
we elevate someone like Ms. Perez to 
the bench, someone we can trust to 
faithfully and equally apply the law of 
our great democracy. 
I was proud to recommend her to 
President Biden, and I look forward to 
formally introducing her to the com-
mittee today. When I met her, as I did 
to interview candidates, she knocked 
my socks off with her brilliance, her 
persistence, and her strong and won-
derful personality. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
VOTING LAWS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, at 
any particular moment, with total cer-
tainty, Washington Democrats know 
one of two things to be true, either 
American democracy is so well-func-
tioning, so sacrosanct that nobody can 
possibly question or badmouth it; or 
democracy is in total crisis, hanging on 
by a thread, and only a massive, sweep-
ing partisan overhaul by Democrats 
can save it. 
Now, it can be hard to guess which of 
those opposite stories Democrats will 
be shouting on any given day. The nar-
rative flip-flops at a dizzying pace. 
After 2016, when voters picked Repub-
licans, Secretary Clinton and a whole 
cast of senior Democrats called the 
new President illegitimate. Two-thirds 
of all Democrats said Russia had prob-
ably or definitely hacked into our vot-
ing systems and actually changed the 
tallies, a baseless conspiracy theory, a 
big lie. 
Four years later, they kept insisting 
that democracy was broken and Demo-
crats had to overhaul it. H.R. 1 was 
written and introduced on that pre-
tense. 
As recently as last summer, when the 
2020 election was looking close, Demo-
crats and cable news spent multiple 
weeks in literal hysterics over what 
they said was a massive secret election 
conspiracy revolving around the Postal 
Service—another big lie. 
It was one frantic meltdown after an-
other, constant, silly claims that our 
democracy would die. But last Novem-
ber, their story turned on a dime be-
cause Democrats got election results 
they liked a lot better. 
Now, suddenly, our elections were no 
longer in crisis. Now American democ-
racy was finely tuned, fully legitimate, 
and beyond reproach. For about 11 
weeks, from President Biden’s election 
through his inauguration, Democrats 
and their immediate friends briefly 
stopped being our democracy’s biggest 
doubters and became its No. 1 fans. But 
now, as Democrats look ahead to the 
first midterm that is almost always 
challenging for the sitting President’s 
party, the silly hysterics have been 
switched right back on. 
This spring, the State of Georgia 
passed a mainstream election law that 
expanded early voting and made drop 
boxes permanent for the first time. The 
left responded with a total meltdown. 
Regulations that left Georgia with 
more flexible early voting and more 
flexible absentee voting than many 
blue States, including New York, were, 
insanely, called ‘‘Jim Crow 2.0.’’ What 
nonsense. 
Georgia Democrats scared huge cor-
porations into promoting a moral panic 
that was completely and totally false. 
It was a shameless effort to manufac-
ture an air of crisis to help Democrats 
ram 
their 
election 
takeover 
bills 
through the Congress, but it didn’t 
work. The Senate rejected all the bad 
ideas in S. 1, so the made-up outrage 
had to be cranked up even higher—even 
higher. 
So this week, State legislators from 
Texas decided to grab some beer, hop 
on a private plane, and flee the State 
in what they are pretending is some 
great moral crusade. In reality, they 
have just come here to Washington to 
snap selfies, bask in the limelight, and 
beg Senate Democrats to take over 
Texas elections. 
Once again, this outrage is com-
pletely phony. The Texas Legislature 
was going to consider bills that would 
expand the minimum hours of early 
voting, make even more counties pro-
vide 12-hour days of early voting, and 
make it even easier for voters to fix 
mistakes on mail-in ballots so their 
votes would actually count. These bills 
would apply voter ID to mail-in ballots 
through a simple process that doesn’t 
even require a driver’s license number. 
They would clean up voter rolls to re-
move voters who have died or moved 
away. 
This is not controversial stuff; it is 
common sense. More than 80 percent of 
Texans support voter ID. But Demo-
crats have pulled out the same Chicken 
Little playbook that failed in Georgia, 
the same big lies. 
Yesterday, 
the 
President 
of 
the 
United States delivered a speech that 
was set in an alternate universe. He 
called these mainstream State laws, 
these modest integrity measures that 
are wildly popular with Americans— 
now, listen to this—‘‘the most signifi-
cant test of our democracy since the 
Civil War.’’ Really? This is our new 
President, who promised to lower the 
temperature, bring America back to-
gether, and rebuild a civil society 
where we can dialogue as fellow citi-
zens? That is the person who is now 
yelling that mainstream State laws are 
more dangerous than two world wars, 
more dangerous than poll tests and 
Bull Connor and actual Jim Crow seg-
regation and somehow analogous to the 
Civil War? That is what the President 
of the United States said yesterday? 
What utter nonsense. It would be 
laugh-out-loud funny if it wasn’t so 
completely and totally irresponsible. 
Here are the great sins of the Texas 
proposals. Here is what is apparently 
so outrageous: They want to wind down 
a few emergency COVID voting proce-
dures, including drive-through voting 
and polling places that are open all 
night long. I am serious. That is what 
this is all about, that they want to 
wind down two COVID voting proce-
dures: drive-through voting and polling 
places that are open 24/7. 
Because of the pandemic, for the first 
time ever, some places in Texas experi-
mented with these brandnew, unusual 
measures, but now winding them down 
is somehow an assault on democracy? 
Really? If Texas is not interested in 
permanently letting people vote from 
their car windows or at 3 in the morn-
ing, then President Biden says that 
‘‘they want to make it so hard and in-
convenient they hope people don’t vote 
at all,’’ simply because you can’t vote 
all night? Really? These brandnew ex-
ceptions for a 100-year pandemic are 
supposed to now be sacred pillars of our 
system. Things that we did last year to 
deal with a 100-year pandemic—to get 
rid of any of that is a threat to our sys-
tem? 
Voter ID protections are supported 
by majorities of White Americans, 
Black Americans, and Hispanic Ameri-
cans, but President Biden calls these 
things ‘‘a 21st-century Jim Crow as-
sault’’—one big lie after another. These 
people think that if they just keep re-
peating the same melodramatic cli-
chEs, they will finally get to pull off 
the power grab. 
These false comparisons are an insult 
to the actual hurdles that Americans 
have overcome over the years together. 
We have won two world wars, faced 
down the Soviets, unwound brutal seg-
regation, defeated actual Jim Crow 
laws, and endured the 9/11 attacks, but 
now the sky is falling? The sky is fall-
ing because of these mainstream laws 
that people actually support? Because 
Texans want to allow 16-hour days of 
voting but just not in the dead of 
night? 
Do they know that nobody outside of 
liberal Twitter and cable television is 
buying an ounce of what they are sell-
ing? The big lies, the fake outrage 
failed in Georgia. The big lies and fake 
outrage failed here in the Senate, and 
they will fail in Texas. 
The big lies and fake outrage are to-
tally failing to persuade the American 
people. Americans want to make it 
easy to vote but hard to cheat. Ameri-
cans know that having widespread and 
accessible voting, along with voter ID, 
isn’t an attack on democracy; it is the 
definition of democracy. 
So, look, I understand the Democrats 
may be growing nervous about the 2022 
elections. I can see why. Liberal poli-
cies are overspending, overborrowing, 
and hurting our economy. They are de-
stabilizing the Middle East, weakening 
our southern border, and increasing 
violent crime across our country. But 
the solution is not to keep lying to the 
American people about the health of 
our democracy. The answer is not this 
desperate craving for an unprecedented

partisan

Washington 
Democrats can appoint themselves the 
board of elections for every county and 
State. 
The longer these fake hysterics keep 
up, the more Americans will keep won-
dering just why Democrats are this 
desperate—this desperate to seize con-
trol over election laws and why Demo-
crats are this panicked by the prospect 
of voter integrity measures that are 
simple, that are fair, and that are pop-
ular with the American people. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
TEXAS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Re-
publican leader was here a few mo-
ments ago discussing an issue which I 
think has gotten a lot of play here 
lately, and that is this attempt by 
Democrat members of the Texas Legis-
lature to come to Washington, DC, to 
protest legislation that is being moved 
through the legislature in the State of 
Texas. In fact, this is the cover of one 
of yesterday’s newspapers—or I should 
say today’s newspapers. 
It has a photo there of all the Demo-
crat legislators from Texas meeting 
with the Democrat leadership here in 
the U.S. Senate. Allegedly, they are 
here, playing hooky from their jobs in 
Texas, having flown in, I am told, on 
private jets—so much for doing some-
thing about the climate—to protest the 
fact that in Texas their voices are not 
being heard and not being given input 
into the legislative process there. 
I point that out simply because it is 
really incredibly ironic. I mean, it is 
rich with irony. Sometimes, around 
here, you just say you can’t make this 
stuff up. They are here in Washington, 
DC, away from Texas, which is where 
their jobs are, to protest the fact that 
their views and voice are not being 
heard in Texas and that the majority 
in Texas is running roughshod over the 
minority and their rights. 
The same Democrats, I would add, 
here in Washington, DC, are trying to 
get rid of the legislative filibuster in 
the U.S. Senate, the very mechanism 
that historically has protected the 
rights of the minority and given them 
a voice in the legislative process, the 
very thing that has been used histori-
cally in a way that ensures that the 
Senate has to come together behind big 
solutions, collaborate, find that com-
mon ground, find that compromise. 
The Democrats here in Washington and 
these Democrats from Texas are all in 
favor of getting rid of the legislative 
filibuster. 
Think about that. It is really pretty 
remarkable that they would come up 
here to protest what is happening in 
Texas at a time when they support get-
ting rid of the very protections that 
give the minority here in the U.S. Sen-
ate a voice in that legislative process. 
And the other really remarkable 
irony about this is the issue that they 
are here to speak in support of S. 1, the 
bill that would federalize, that would 
nationalize elections in this country 
and take power away from States when 
it comes to regulating and admin-
istering elections, a power that has 
been held by States going back to the 
Founders. 
And so they came here basically to 
say you need to pass H.R. 1. Well, 
again, what is H.R. 1? H.R. 1 is this 
massive Federal takeover of elections 
in this country, and it is also the test 
case for why we have got to get rid of 
the legislative filibuster. 
I would be willing to bet that the 
Democrat leader at some point in the 
next couple of weeks is going to call up 
S. 1 again. We voted on it once already, 
but he is going to call it up again be-
cause he thinks it is good politics, and, 
plus, he wants to pressure his Members 
to do away with the legislative fili-
buster in order to pass S. 1 with 51 
votes. 
So, again, the irony of all of this, 
honestly, is some stuff you just flat 
can’t make up. But I would reiterate 
what I have said before about S. 1: It is 
a solution in search of a problem. We 
have States around this country who 
are, in some cases moving to put in 
place 
election 
integrity 
measures, 
measures that will ensure that every 
vote counts and that everybody has an 
opportunity to vote but that people 
don’t have an opportunity to cheat. 
That is all it is about. It is about 
election integrity. And most of the 
measures that are being adopted in 
States around this country are simply 
that—nothing more, nothing less—and, 
again, historically consistent with the 
way that our election process has been 
governed in this country, and that is to 
allow States to make those to do 
things in a decentralized way, to not 
consolidate power in Washington, DC, 
but rather to distribute that power and 
make it that much harder to hack into 
it. 
I mean, you think about it, you have 
50 election systems in this country. It 
was what the Founders intended. They 
wanted to distribute power. They want-
ed to have a decentralized system, not 
one that was driven and controlled by 
a bureaucracy here in Washington, DC. 
I think that is consistent with what 
the American people believe ought to 
happen and the cases it should be when 
it comes to elections in this country. 
So it really is interesting to see these 
Democrat legislators from Texas com-
ing to Washington, coming all the way 
up here—again, playing hooky from 
their jobs in Texas—to protest a piece 
of legislation that is being used by the 
Democrat leadership to try and get rid 
of the legislative filibuster, the very 
mechanism that protects the rights 
and the voice of the minority in the 
U.S. Senate. It has, literally, since our 
country’s founding. 
AGRICULTURE 
Mr. President, last week, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture announced 
that, going forward, agriculture pro-
ducers will be able to hay or graze 
cover crops on prevented plant acres at 
any time, without a reduction in their 
prevented planting payments. 
This is good news for farmers around 
the country but particularly for farm-
ers in more northern States like South 
Dakota, who were left at a significant 
disadvantage by the previous haying 
and grazing date. I have been working 
on this issue since 2019, when the ef-
fects of a tough winter, rainfall, and 
flooding kept many South Dakota 
farmers from their usual planting. 
As a result, many farmers were look-
ing to sow quick cover growing crops 
on the acres they were unable to plant 
with their usual crops. But they faced 
a problem. At the time, the Depart-
ment of Agriculture would not allow 
farmers to harvest or graze these cover 
crops until November 1 each year. 
Farmers who hayed or grazed before 
this date faced a reduction in their pre-
vent planting payments, which are 
crop insurance payments to help them 
cover their income loss when fields 
can’t be planted due to flooding or 
other issues. 
Now, November 1 was a generally 
pretty reasonable date for farmers in 
southern 
States. 
But 
in 
northern 
States, like South Dakota, November 1 
was often too late for harvesting, 
thanks to the risk of snow and other 
late fall or early winter storms. It was 
also too late to maximize the use of 
cover crops for pasture, since the 
ground could freeze before cover crops 
were fully grazed. 
So I and other Members of Congress 
successfully lobbied the Department of 
Agriculture to move up the hay and 
grazing date for 2019. But that was a 
short-term fix, I should say, for a fre-
quent problem. So in March of 2020, I 
introduced, legislation, along with Sen-
ator STABENOW, to permanently remove 
the November 1 haying and grazing 
date. And I continued to lobby USDA 
on this issue. 
I am very pleased that the Depart-
ment of Agriculture has listened to 
farmers and the Members who rep-
resent them and permanently elimi-
nated the November 1 date. Cover crops 
are a win-win situation for farmers and 
for the environment. They prevent soil 
erosion, which can pollute streams and 
rivers and worsen flooding. They im-
prove soil health, which improves fu-
ture crop yields and benefits the envi-
ronment. And they reduce feed short-
ages for ag producers by providing an-
other source of feed for their livestock. 
Last week’s decision by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture will reduce a bar-
rier to cover crop adaptation and en-
sure 
that 
farmers 
throughout 
the 
United States are able to reap the ben-
efits of sowing these crops. 
USDA’s decision is a big victory—a 
big victory—for South Dakota farmers

and farmers in other northern States. 
But, unfortunately, it doesn’t solve the 
challenges agriculture producers in my 
State are facing this summer. Right 
now, almost every acre of land in 
South Dakota is experiencing drought 
conditions. A huge portion of the State 
is facing a severe drought. And some 
areas of the State have been classified 
as being in extreme drought. And ag 
producers in other States are facing 
similar conditions. 
Hay is in short supply. Without ade-
quate forage, some cattle producers are 
being forced to cut down their herds, 
which is devastating for producers who 
have spent years building their herds. 
Emergency haying and grazing of Con-
servation Reserve Program acres can 
help alleviate forage shortages for live-
stock producers during drought years. 
South Dakota has nearly 1.4 million 
acres enrolled in the Conservation Re-
serve Program—at least at one time 
that was the number. It is not that 
high anymore. I am a longtime cham-
pion of this program, which supports 
both the production, agriculture, and 
hunting industries in South Dakota. 
The Conservation Reserve Program 
provides critical habitat for pheasants 
and other wildlife, which contributes 
significantly to our State’s economy. 
Haying and grazing CRP acres can also 
provide a lifeline for South Dakota ag 
producers during droughts like the one 
that our State is currently facing. 
Last month, I sent a letter to USDA 
Secretary Tom Vilsack urging him to 
release additional Conservation Re-
serve Program acres to help South Da-
kota producers, many of whom are in 
desperate need. And while I am pleased 
USDA is currently allowing emergency 
grazing in many counties, emergency 
CRP haying is not allowed until after 
the primary nesting season ends on Au-
gust 1, which is too late in a drought 
year. 
Agriculture is a tough business, and 
our producers have had to endure a tre-
mendous amount over the past few 
years from tough weather conditions, 
to the COVID pandemic. Cattle pro-
ducers are also dealing with market 
volatility that has recently provided 
record-high 
profit 
margins 
for 
meatpackers, while producers struggle 
to stay in business. 
I will continue pressing the adminis-
tration and working with my col-
leagues 
to 
hold 
the 
big 
four 
meatpackers accountable to the pro-
ducers and consumers who depend on 
them. The Department of Agriculture 
should do everything it can to help 
farmers and ranchers weather this 
drought. And I will keep doing every-
thing I can to get relief to producers in 
my State and around the country. 
I am grateful for the Department of 
Agriculture’s decision on haying and 
grazing on prevented planting acres. 
And I will keep working to ensure that 
CRP and all USDA programs have the 
flexibility necessary to meet the needs 
of producers while also making sure we 
balance the wildlife and conservation 
needs of our State. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
FENTANYL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
countdown is on. Today marks the be-
ginning of 100 days until the critical 
and 
lifesaving 
authority 
placing 
fentanyl-related substances in schedule 
I expires. In 100 days that expires. 
Congress has extended this authority 
multiple times, most recently in May. 
However, when choosing how long to 
extend this authority, Congress short-
changed itself by providing only 5 
months to contemplate how to perma-
nently control fentanyl analogs. I 
pushed for a longer extension, even 
spearheading 
bipartisan 
legislation 
that would have extended this author-
ity into the next year, but my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
insisted that 5 months was sufficient to 
work with the administration to find a 
permanent 
solution 
scheduling 
fentanyl-related substances. 
I had skepticism about this when the 
5-month extension passed in May, and I 
have even more skepticism now. That 
is because we are only 100 days away 
from losing this essential authority 
and the administration still has not in-
dicated how it intends to solve this 
problem. So Congress is operating in 
the dark. 
The administration says that a legis-
lative proposal will be sent to Congress 
as early as next month. But this pro-
posal won’t be a done deal once it ar-
rives on Capitol Hill because, you 
know, Presidents propose, Congress 
disposes. 
If it doesn’t include measures to pro-
tect vulnerable communities, to pre-
vent more drug overdose victims, and 
proactively deter and punish drug traf-
fickers, then it won’t be enough to 
solve 
the 
problems 
of 
a 
drug— 
fentanyl—killing several hundred thou-
sand people. 
I have been beating the drum on 
scheduling fentanyl analogs for a long 
period of time because it is a fight 
worth having. We simply can’t afford 
to let these deadly substances go un-
scheduled. 
What happens if we don’t schedule 
fentanyl analogs in the next 100 days? 
Well, it is pretty obvious. Opioid-re-
lated deaths fueled by fentanyl analogs 
increased by 35 percent in my State of 
Iowa. What about the other 49 States? 
But 35 percent in Iowa last year. That 
happens to be in line with nationwide 
trends. So deaths will continue to rise 
if we don’t buckle down and get onto 
this issue of scheduling fentanyl sched-
ule I on a permanent basis. 
Also, according to the Customs and 
Border Patrol, so far this year, enough 
fentanyl and its analogs have been 
seized to kill the entire population of 
the United States not once, but 10 
times over. 
Some may view drug crimes as 
victimless. You need to tell that to the 
hundreds of thousands of families who 
have lost their brother, sister, parent, 
or child to fentanyl. 
Tell that to Rob and Deb Courtney, 
the parents of Chad Courtney from 
North Liberty, IA. Chad died 5 years 
ago because of fentanyl. He used pain-
killers and then turned to abusing her-
oin. Rod and Deb tried to help their son 
through rehab and treatment. Then 
one day they received the call that 
they had been dreading. Their son died 
because a drug dealer laced heroin with 
a deadly fentanyl substance. Rod said 
that one of the last memories he has of 
his son was picking him up from treat-
ment and Chad stating, ‘‘I just want to 
make a difference.’’ 
We owe it to Chad and the other 
36,359 victims of fentanyl-related over-
dose deaths to make a difference now, 
and that means passing legislation 
that schedules fentanyl and its analogs 
permanently. 
Congress can ensure that we put peo-
ple over profits and communities over 
cartels 
by 
permanently 
scheduling 
fentanyl-related substances. I don’t 
doubt that my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle want to protect their con-
stituents. Nobody wants more overdose 
deaths in their home States. So let’s 
work together to put this issue to rest 
at last. 
Starting today, the countdown is on. 
As I said in the beginning, 100 more 
days. I hope the administration and my 
Senate colleagues are ready to get to 
work 
on 
permanently 
scheduling 
fentanyl-related substances. I know 
that I am ready. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Wyoming. 
NOMINATIONS OF TRACY STONE-MANNING AND 
DAVID CHIPMAN 
Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss two troubling nomina-
tions by President Biden for positions 
that have very real impacts on my 
State of Wyoming and the people who 
live there. 
One of the simplest yet truest rules 
of governance is that personnel is pol-
icy. We have seen this rule play out 
over and over under President Biden. 
During 
last 
year’s 
election, 
the 
media created a narrative that a Biden 
Presidency would unite the country 
with bipartisanship. That has not hap-
pened. Many of the President’s policies 
have been extreme appeals to the far 
left and decidedly hostile to our way of 
life in Wyoming and the West. 
I believe much of this can be traced 
to the people with whom he has sur-
rounded himself and to those he has ap-
pointed. That is why I am so concerned 
about two of the President’s nominees 
that the Senate is considering. 
First, there is Tracy Stone-Manning, 
President Biden’s nominee to serve as

July 14, 2021 
Director of the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. I am particularly interested 
in this nomination because the BLM 
manages about 18 million acres in Wyo-
ming and huge tracts of land through-
out the West. In fact, 90 percent of Fed-
eral and public land is west of the Mis-
sissippi. 
We need a land manager who under-
stands, respects, and implements mul-
tiple use of public lands with which 
Americans in the West are particularly 
accustomed. 
The BLM has historically managed 
for multiple use, which is, in many 
cases, required by law. Under Ms. 
Stone-Manning, I am very concerned 
that 
multiple-use 
principles 
will 
change. The reason is quite simple. 
This nominee is a radical. She has been 
involved with ecoterrorists in the past, 
including a tree-spiking incident in 
Idaho. 
Her extremist ties and past activism 
have even led a former Obama BLM Di-
rector to withdraw his support for her. 
Wyoming and other States in the West 
would be completely hamstrung if BLM 
land policy changed. Given Ms. Stone- 
Manning’s militant history, I am not 
sure she would care. 
Then there is David Chipman, Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee to lead the Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives. One would be hard-pressed 
to identify a worse candidate for the 
job. 
According to reports, Chipman may 
have lost his own gun while serving as 
an ATF agent. He also failed twice to 
define the term ‘‘assault weapon’’ dur-
ing his confirmation hearing. This 
level of irresponsibility and lack of 
basic firearms knowledge is hardly an 
endorsement for someone tasked with 
overseeing gun use in the United 
States. 
Chipman has also reportedly accused 
Black Americans who were successful 
on an ATF test of cheating because, in 
his opinion, too many were passing the 
test. 
Let’s be real. This kind of discrimi-
nation would tank a Republican can-
didate. 
Mr. Chipman has also endorsed ef-
forts to defund the police and has sup-
ported the science fiction-sounding no-
tion of precrime arrests. His idea of ef-
fective law enforcement would be to ar-
rest people before they commit crimes. 
I came to Washington to solve real 
problems and get things done. I don’t 
care if the solutions come from the 
right or the left. I am here to support 
good legislation and good policy. That 
is why I have backed President Biden’s 
decision to bring our troops home from 
Afghanistan. That is why I have sup-
ported many of his nominees with 
whom I may disagree on some policy 
points, but they are nonetheless quali-
fied for the roles—nominees including 
Janet Yellen, Pete Buttigieg, and Gary 
Gensler. 
But based on their past experience 
and expressed behavior, Tracy Stone- 
Manning and David Chipman have dis-
qualified themselves and are direct 
contradictions to the bipartisanship 
and unity that President Biden called 
for and promised in his inaugural ad-
dress. 
If these extremist nominees are con-
firmed, they will direct their respec-
tive agencies toward ends that are ac-
tively and openly hostile to the Wyo-
ming way of life that I am here in 
Washington to support and defend. 
I call on President Biden to withdraw 
these names and, instead, send us 
nominees for these positions who bet-
ter reflect the bipartisan reputation 
the President spent decades cultivating 
in this Senate. If the President does 
not withdraw these nominees, I strong-
ly urge my colleagues to vote to reject 
them. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The senior Senator from Arkan-
sas. 
HONORING OFFICER KEVIN DALE APPLE 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, it is 
an honor to be with my friend and col-
league Senator COTTON as we rise to 
honor Pea Ridge Police Officer Kevin 
Apple, who was killed in the line of 
duty on Saturday, June 26. 
He made the ultimate sacrifice while 
attempting to apprehend two suspects 
who were fleeing from police. Although 
this was the last example of his selfless 
service and dedication to protecting his 
community, it was certainly not the 
only one. 
Officer Apple bravely devoted his life 
to law enforcement and the good that 
it can bring about. He worked tire-
lessly to uphold law and order over the 
course of 23 years, serving several 
northwest Arkansas communities, in-
cluding Pea Ridge for the last 3 years. 
He was known to consistently support 
others. The compassion he exhibited in 
and out of uniform will be fondly re-
membered by those he helped. 
‘‘He gave me hope again,’’ one citizen 
remarked of Officer Apple. 
Another individual commented that, 
as a result of Officer Apple, he changed 
his life. Now, more than 20 years later, 
he maintains a deep appreciation of the 
support he received from Officer Apple. 
He did much more than serve and 
protect. The Pea Ridge police chief 
said that Officer Apple put humanity 
in the job. For a police officer, there is 
no higher compliment than that. 
He was also known as a prankster. He 
was usually upbeat and lifted the spir-
its of those around him with a smile 
that would light up a room. 
Friends, neighbors, and colleagues 
describe him as someone who cared 
passionately about his role in sup-
porting public safety and was more 
concerned about lending a helping hand 
rather than writing tickets. He was a 
loyal friend and leader who always put 
the needs of others above his own. 
Officer Apple leaves a legacy of last-
ing impact on all of those whose lives 
he touched in his own unique way. 
Whether attending a child’s birthday 
party or checking on an elderly citizen, 
he went above and beyond the call of 
duty and constantly showed his dedica-
tion to the people he was sworn to pro-
tect. 
My hope is the community’s support 
will provide comfort to his family, his 
friends, and brothers and sisters in 
blue. We can be very proud of how 
northwest Arkansas has already bond-
ed together to give back to the Pea 
Ridge Police Department and this fall-
en law enforcement officer’s loved 
ones. 
Officer Apple was the embodiment of 
what it means to wear a police badge 
and uniform. His exemplary service and 
dedication to serving his community 
are truly inspirational, and he leaves 
behind a worthy example for other offi-
cers to imitate. 
We all mourn the loss of Officer 
Apple and are deeply saddened by this 
tragedy. I join with Arkansans in ex-
pressing our gratitude for his service 
and sacrifice. I am honored to recog-
nize his life with Senator COTTON today 
and pray that his family and his col-
leagues and community members know 
that he will forever be remembered as 
a hero. 
With that, I yield to Senator COTTON. 
Mr. COTTON. I thank Senator BOOZ-
MAN. 
Mr. President, Police Officer Kevin 
Dale Apple of the Pea Ridge Police De-
partment protected the community he 
loved for 23 years, but Officer Apple’s 
long and honorable career in law en-
forcement was cut tragically short just 
a couple of weeks ago. 
It all began with a call to ‘‘be on the 
lookout’’ for a blue Jeep that was flee-
ing from police in Rogers. Officer Apple 
and a fellow officer spotted the vehicle 
at a convenience store, and they sprang 
into action, approaching the car to 
speak to its occupants. When they did, 
the driver of the Jeep rammed one of 
their police cars and then struck Offi-
cer Apple, dragging him to his death. 
He succumbed to his injuries at the age 
of 53. 
Officer Apple’s death is a tragedy and 
a crime, but it is also a reminder; it is 
a reminder of the grave danger that po-
lice officers face across the country 
every day when they put on the bullet-
proof vest and leave home, not know-
ing whether they will go home that 
night to take it off. This year alone, in 
being barely halfway through the year, 
162 law enforcement officers have died 
in the line of duty across our country. 
Officer Apple’s death is also a re-
minder that, every time an officer ap-
proaches a suspect, he or she may be 
exposed to hidden threats, which may 
be a concealed weapon or, in this case, 
a vehicle that has been transformed 
into an instrument of death. All of the 
comfortable critics of the police who 
love to second-guess their every move, 
while officers are under incredible 
stress and danger in the heat of the 
moment, can stand to learn that sober-
ing fact. 
Officer Apple’s death is also a warn-
ing of the tragic consequences of ill-

conceived, soft-on-crime policies. The 
woman 
who 
killed 
Officer 
Apple, 
Shawna Cash, was known by police 
long before that fateful day. She was 
facing multiple counts of theft and 
other drug-related offenses, but she 
was reportedly released from jail due 
to the coronavirus. 
When criminals get let out of jail and 
are put back on our streets, tragedy 
tends to follow. A brave officer would 
still be alive today if his killer had re-
mained behind bars. The trade-off here 
should be obvious. This criminal, with 
a rap sheet longer than your arm, 
should have remained in jail, and Offi-
cer Apple should have gone home to his 
friends and his family. For every future 
Shawna Cash who gets let out of jail 
early because of the coronavirus or 
soft-on-crime policies or other foolish 
and naive reasons, just remember: 
There could be another Officer Apple or 
another murder victim or rape victim. 
Like every victim of the terrible 
murder wave sweeping our Nation, Offi-
cer Apple’s life mattered. He leaves be-
hind loved ones like Dalene, his moth-
er, and Kyle, his brother. He leaves be-
hind fellow officers and comrades who 
remember his jokes and his goofy sense 
of humor. He leaves behind a legacy of 
23 years of honorable, courageous serv-
ice to his fellow Arkansans. 
Officer Apple will not be forgotten, 
and we must never forget the lawmen 
who lay down their lives to keep the 
rest of us safe. We will respect Officer 
Apple’s memory just as we respect 
every law enforcement officer who 
wears the badge with honor.

THE ECONOMY 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, like 
all of us, I just got back from spending 
some time at home. I got back from 
being there and making a difference. I 
think one of the important things of 
being outside of Washington is you get 
a chance to hear what people are really 
concerned about. We have all kinds of 
speeches given here every day of what 
Members of Congress are absolutely 
sure people are concerned about. I

July 14, 2021 
think that topic becomes much more 
crystal clear when you get home. I 
know it is certainly much more crystal 
clear to me when I am home in Mis-
souri. 
Over the Fourth of July holiday, 
there were a number of visits all over 
the State—to Columbia, St. Louis, 
Montgomery City, Monroe City. There 
were lots of events everywhere in the 
State at which I talked about the im-
portance of getting the vaccine and the 
progress we were making there, but the 
first thing that people wanted to talk 
to me about was inflation. People are 
already seeing that prices are well 
above the numbers that they believe 
they are seeing that the official num-
bers are confirming. 
In May of this year, prices were 5 per-
cent higher than they were in May a 
year ago. In June, they were 5.4 percent 
higher than they were a year ago, but 
people are seeing a lot of prices that 
are higher than that. The price of 
whole milk is up 7.5 percent from a 
year ago. The price of an airplane tick-
et has averaged up about 25 percent 
from a year ago. Used cars are more ex-
pensive than they were last June. In 
fact, they are 45 percent more expen-
sive than they were a year ago in June. 
There is an incredible increase in the 
cost of things that people not only 
want to buy but on those things that 
are more pressing: what people have to 
buy and need to buy. 
A lot of people specifically talked to 
me about gas prices. I was on the road 
a lot, driving a lot while I was home, 
and I saw those prices for myself. The 
average cost of a gallon of regular gas-
oline nationwide is about $3.15. That is 
45 percent higher than in June of last 
year. That is a hidden tax that working 
people pay every day. 
Whether it is a hidden tax on a glass 
of milk, a hidden tax on a tank of gas, 
or a hidden tax on other things that 
they like to do or have to do, it makes 
a real difference for the people who 
want to take a vacation or have to 
travel to work. In the part of Missouri 
that I live in, there are a lot of little 
towns that have manufacturing jobs. It 
is not unusual for somebody to drive 40 
or 50 miles one way to get to that job, 
and if gasoline is 45 percent higher 
than it was a year ago, it makes a real 
difference. That is a real hidden tax, 
and it is usually a hidden tax on the 
people to whom the President rightly 
would not want to pass on tax in-
creases. 
I think the administration has to 
start taking into account the issues 
that are out there. Larry Summers and 
others from the Obama administration 
have warned of the great risk of infla-
tion. When we talk about energy, for 
instance, I think we have to do that, 
clearly, in a way that, if we are making 
transitions to energy, we don’t make 
those transitions in a way that need-
lessly have a negative impact on fami-
lies and on opportunities. 
In his first few days in office, Presi-
dent Biden rescinded the permit for the 
Keystone XL Pipeline, and not too long 
after that, he blocked the new oil and 
gas leases in Alaska and the Gulf of 
Mexico. These were things that Con-
gress had talked about for a long time 
and, in some cases, were things Con-
gress had specifically decided were 
timely to do, but an Executive order 
from the President decided, no, we are 
going to head in a different direction. 
That was just the beginning, really, 
of what my colleagues have seen in the 
discussion in Congress and what my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
in 
Congress 
have in mind. So, if you like paying 
higher prices for gasoline, you are 
going to love what happens to the re-
strictions that go into effect and drive 
prices of all energy even higher. 
The other thing I talked to small 
business owners about and, frankly, to 
all business owners about was the trou-
ble in finding enough workers. Repub-
lican Governors in 25 States have now 
determined that the larger unemploy-
ment benefit kept people from going 
back to work. People were choosing to 
stay on the sidelines rather than go to 
work. Frankly, if you looked at that 
$618 weekly unemployment check that 
was the average in America in May, 
that unemployment check didn’t have 
any childcare costs associated with it, 
and it didn’t have any travel to work 
associated with it. You have to have a 
job that pays a lot to not consider, if I 
am continuing to get this check, why 
should I go back to work? 
Missouri was one of the 25 States 
that decided that the extra bonus was 
not only bad for families in their not 
going back to work but that it was bad 
for our economy. So, as of June 12, the 
return to the important but much 
lower normal unemployment benefit 
happened in our State, and I think you 
can already see people making the de-
cision that it is time to go back to 
work. 
Surprisingly, even though we have 
created a lot of opportunities for peo-
ple to stay home, the June economy 
created 850,000 new jobs, and we should 
all feel good about that, but if this is 
an economy that has created 850,000 
new jobs, at some point, we have to 
stop pushing money into that economy 
that we don’t have. There are, obvi-
ously, a lot of factors at play here, but 
the 850,000 people going back to work is 
an important and a significant thing. 
Part of the explanation, obviously, is 
the rush by Republican Governors, 
principally, to eliminate that bonus, 
but part of it is just simply an econ-
omy that is already beginning to re-
bound—to rebound based on the cur-
rent tax structure and rebound based 
on what governments already spend 
rather than this incredible rush to 
drive inflation even further. 
The Congressional Budget Office put 
out a new report recently that read the 
Federal deficit for this fiscal year will 
be more than $3 trillion. The problem 
is that nobody has any idea what $3 
trillion really is, and that probably in-
cludes most of us. If I said the deficit 
was $3 million or $300,000, somehow di-
vided up to every American family, we 
would immediately think: Oh, my 
goodness. We could never deal with 
that. 
By the way, it was just announced 
that there is a budget agreement on 
top of that $3 trillion deficit to spend 
another $3.5 trillion. 
It is time we started talking frankly 
about how much $3 trillion really is. 
That $3 trillion is something that 
somebody has to pay back sometime. 
All that borrowing and spending has 
been one of the big factors contributing 
to inflation. It doesn’t even count the 
$3.5 trillion, again, that had been added 
just overnight in that discussion. 
Some people are beginning to call 
this Bidenomics. I think Congress has 
to take its share of responsibility here. 
The belief that we can spend without 
limit and that it won’t cause any prob-
lems is outrageous. The idea that we 
can pay people not to work or pay 
them more than they would make if 
they did work is outrageous. All of 
these things lead to unintended con-
sequences. There is a belief that high 
gas prices and inflation are just tem-
porary and that people shouldn’t be 
concerned about it. Well, people are 
concerned, and they should be con-
cerned. 
I hope my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle will spend some time 
listening to people, hearing their con-
cerns. I hope they will reconsider their 
policies that are fueling inflation and 
holding back our economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to use a prop dur-
ing my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, Presi-
dent Biden’s economic policies are 
causing nationwide sticker shock. 
The price of nearly everything is 
higher today than it has been since 
Biden was in the White House the first 
time. The cost of consumer goods has 
gone up every month since January, 
and the markup in prices over the past 
year is the biggest annual increase 
since 2008. The Democrats’ response to 
these rising prices is to simply spend 
more, which is making the problem 
worse. 
Paying people not to work is contrib-
uting to worker shortages. Not having 
enough workers is resulting in service 
and supply shortages. Combine these 
two factors with trillions of dollars of 
government spending, and it all adds 
up to higher prices on everything for 
everyone. It is a common story wher-
ever I visit on my 99-county tour. Be-
cause of Washington’s upside-down eco-
nomic policies, small businesses are 
struggling to hire workers, and our 
families are paying much more for far 
less. 
Put simply, under Bidenomics, the 
price is up. Everyday products, like

diapers and paper towels, are either in-
creasing in cost or decreasing in size, 
which is the same result: more money 
out of our wallets. Whether you are 
eating in or you are dining out, the one 
thing you are guaranteed to find on 
every 
supermarket 
shelf 
and 
res-
taurant menu is higher prices. 
A pound of sliced bacon has increased 
a whole dollar in just the past year, 
and the fast-food dollar menu is dis-
appearing. We are paying more at the 
pump too. A year ago, a gallon of gas 
cost about $2.18. Today, the price is 
just under $3 in Iowa. Nationally, the 
cost has risen to about $3.15 per gallon 
and is expected to keep going up 
throughout the summer. Meanwhile, 
rising shipping costs are lifting the 
prices of everything from coffee to fur-
niture. 
All in all, Bidenomics has resulted in 
the biggest surge in inflation in nearly 
13 years. For Iowans who are living on 
a budget, these unpredictable price 
markups are making every purchase a 
real guessing game. They keep finding 
themselves asking if the price is right. 
To demonstrate just how much costs 
are spinning out of control, I have 
brought the wheel of inflation with me 
here today. Each of the numbers on the 
wheel represents a price increase for a 
common household product. It will tell 
us exactly how much more Bidenomics 
is costing hard-working Americans. 
So, folks, let’s go ahead and give it a 
spin. 
No. 8. In the past year, the price of 
bacon is up about 8 percent. 
Give her a good spin. 
OK. No. 5, and it is a black 5. In the 
past year, the price of clothes is up 
about 5 percent. 
No. 11. In the past year, the price of 
auto insurance is up 11 percent; and if 
you go to the 17 there, you will find 
that hotel rates, the price has gone up 
17 percent in the last year. 
There are no winning numbers on 
this wheel. Again, every number rep-
resents the increase of a common good 
American consumers are dealing with. 
There are no winning numbers on this 
wheel. No matter how you spin it, we 
simply 
cannot 
afford 
any 
more 
Bidenomics. I think the American peo-
ple will agree, all of these prices need 
to come on down. But instead of ad-
dressing inflation, Democrats are try-
ing to outbid one another over a mas-
sive new government spending program 
they are calling human infrastructure. 
Want to guess what the price tag 
being floated by the chairman of the 
Senate Budget Committee for this 
package might be? Three and a half 
trillion 
dollars—all 
capital 
letters, 
folks. 
The endless giveaway of cash and 
prizes may make it appear like Demo-
crats in Washington are running a 
game show, but we all know that this 
is not a game. With our national debt 
approaching $30 trillion, the bills are 
eventually going to come due. And you 
know who will be stuck with the tab? 
Taxpayers. 
What runaway inflation doesn’t take 
from working Americans’ paychecks, 
the IRS will take to pay for the Demo-
crats’ never-ending spending. We are 
all going to be paying back the tril-
lions of dollars borrowed to pay for 
Bidenomics, both in higher taxes and 
in higher consumer costs, and that 
price—folks, it isn’t right. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
like my colleague from Iowa who has 
just spoken, I travel Iowa as well, and 
in holding my county meetings and vis-
iting with employers and employees— 
not just these last 2 weeks that we 
have been in recess, but all year—I 
have been hearing all of what Senator 
ERNST has referred to, that people are 
afraid of inflation and a lot of people 
are old enough to remember the 12- to 
15-percent inflation we had during the 
mid-1970s to the early 1980s. We don’t 
want to repeat that. 
Traveling Iowa, it is always refresh-
ing to hear directly from my constitu-
ents because, as I often say, Wash-
ington is an island surrounded by re-
ality. The Midwest seems to be the real 
America compared to what we know 
here in Washington, DC, where every-
thing that dominates the economy is 
affected by government—and very Big 
Government. 
There is no better example of this 
than how the Biden administration and 
Washington elites talk about inflation 
and rising prices. To them, inflation is 
transitory or the result of base effects, 
and those words ‘‘transitory’’ and 
‘‘base effects’’ are used to justify this 
inflation. Really something not to 
worry about, I think, is the impression 
they want to leave us with. 
To the Iowans I spoke with, inflation 
is real and persistent, as Senator 
ERNST has so colorfully shown. I heard 
concerns from my constituents about 
inflation wherever I went. And why? 
Because it is affecting people’s lives 
right now. 
I heard about how inflation was cut-
ting into families’ budgets, making it 
hard to make ends meet. I heard how 
prices in grocery staples, such as milk, 
meat, fruit, vegetables, are on the rise, 
along with all manner of household 
goods. 
Yet the President and his top eco-
nomic advisers say inflation is nothing 
to worry about, or as the President’s 
Treasury Secretary put it, ‘‘I don’t 
think there’s going to be an infla-
tionary problem. But if there is, the 
Fed will be counted on to address it.’’ 
They shouldn’t be so nonchalant about 
it. As we know from the 1970s, once in-
flation takes off, getting it back under 
control can require very painful meas-
ures. 
They should take the advice of 
former 
Clinton 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Summers. He recently stated, ‘‘The 
Fed has had almost no success gently 
bringing down inflation once an econ-
omy has started to overheat.’’ 
Notice that word ‘‘gently’’ because 
everybody thinks this is going to just 
occur very easily, getting it under con-
trol, but we remember the results of 
the 1970s, early eighties. It took Paul 
Volcker 
to 
take 
a 
sledgehammer 
through the policies of the Federal Re-
serve to bring down interest rates. 
And a lot of farmers in Iowa lost 
their farms when they were borrowing 
on that inflation, trusting the govern-
ment that there was no problem, and 
then we have just farmers going out of 
business because Volcker used a sledge-
hammer, and he probably had to use it 
because there wasn’t a gentle way of 
doing it. Unfortunately, instead of tak-
ing inflation seriously, the current ad-
ministration appears intent on stoking 
its flames, pouring gasoline on the in-
flation fire. 
In his budget, the President proposes 
government spending and debt at levels 
previously only seen temporarily dur-
ing war or economic recession. The 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Of-
fice and economists surveyed by the 
Wall Street Journal both recently 
raised 
their 
inflation 
expectations. 
CBO raised its inflation projections be-
cause ‘‘output now exceeds its poten-
tial level sooner and by a larger 
amount than previously anticipated.’’ 
Output exceeding its potential is eco-
nomic speak for the economy is start-
ing to overheat. Consumer price data 
released 
yesterday 
shows 
inflation 
heating up. In June, prices climbed 5.4 
percent over the prior year compared 
to 5 percent in May. Moreover, core in-
flation, which omits volatile food and 
energy goods, rose at the highest rate 
in 29 years. 
The trillions of dollars in new spend-
ing proposed by the President could set 
inflation ablaze. If that occurs, it is 
not going to be the wealthy and the 
Wall Street elites that pay the price. 
The average hard-working American 
living paycheck to paycheck, and par-
ticularly tough on the retiree on fixed 
incomes, those are the people that are 
going to pay more and get less for pay-
ing more. The President would be well 
served to listen more to everyday 
Americans about how rising prices are 
affecting their lives today. 
President Biden might then realize 
pursuing another multitrillion-dollar 
spending spree isn’t worth the risk. It 
could fan the flames of inflation and 
devastate the livelihoods of average 
Americans. 
It is incumbent upon the President 
and the Congress to avert catastrophe 
by pursuing responsible fiscal policies. 
We can’t just expect the Federal Re-
serve to clean up our mess if we act ir-
responsibly by spending another $4 tril-
lion. By that time, it could already be 
too late, waiting on the Fed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. 
WICKER. 
Madam 
President, 
what the senior Senator from Iowa just 
said is exactly right, and unfortu-
nately, the Biden inflation tax increase 
is real, and it is already here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4880 
July 14, 2021 
We warned about it earlier this year 
when our friends on the Democratic 
side decided to spend almost $2 trillion 
that was unnecessary, and here it is. 
Just the other day, consumer prices in-
creased by 5.4 percent. This represents 
the largest year over year price surge 
since 2008. It is a tax increase on every 
American consumer. 
And then today, even worse news, the 
producer price increased 7.3 percent. 
We are in an inflation problem. It is 
caused by this unnecessary spending 
spree that we have been on this year. 
We have known about it—now, we see 
the statistics—because we felt it at 
home. 
And the senior Senator from Iowa 
mentioned what he was hearing during 
the break. Mississippians are paying 
more for a tank of gas, for a gallon of 
milk. They are paying more for a new 
home, for a used car. Used car prices 
have shot up by 10 percent since May 
and by 45 percent since June of last 
year—used cars, up by 45 percent. That 
is real inflation, and it affects real 
working Americans. 
The hard reality is that our economy 
is now saturated with a tsunami of 
spending unleashed by the Democratic 
majority back in March, when party 
leaders abandoned what has been a bal-
anced and bipartisan approach in the 
year 2020 to COVID relief. I would re-
mind my colleagues that in February, 
the Congressional Budget Office had 
predicted our economy was already 
going to return to its prepandemic size 
by midyear without the spending of a 
new $2 trillion. 
As the senior Senator from Iowa 
mentioned, Larry Summers, a longtime 
Democratic adviser, an adviser to 
President Obama, warned that more 
stimulus could overheat the economy 
and cause inflation. And more spending 
came and the economy got overheated, 
and we are faced with real statistics 
about inflation that cannot be denied. 
Our Democratic friends brushed off 
that warning and instead pumped tril-
lions more of borrowed money into our 
economy. Our Nation’s money supply 
has increased by an unheard of 31 per-
cent since the pandemic. Now, some of 
it, we had to do in the year 2020, when 
the economy had fallen off a cliff, but 
we are halfway through 2021, the Fed is 
still printing cash, and the majority 
party in this body seems intent on 
spending trillions more. 
As a result, inflation is now eating 
away at family earnings, at bank ac-
counts, at 401(k) savings accounts, 
most of which are shrinking as a share 
of the economy. Loss of purchasing 
power is making it harder for Ameri-
cans to buy a home, start a family, or 
send their children to college. All of 
this should serve as a caution to all of 
us, to our friends on the other side of 
the aisle. This week’s Consumer Price 
Index and today’s Producer Price Index 
information are an early alarm bell 
signaling that this Congress and the 
Biden administration are courting run-
away inflation. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, if I 
might, I ask unanimous consent that 
Senators MARSHALL, SCOTT of Florida, 
and MURRAY be permitted to speak for 
up to 5 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
this past week, we held 12 townhalls 
back home in my home State of Kan-
sas. We heard from Kansans about a va-
riety of issues, but thanks to this ad-
ministration’s economic policies, run-
away inflation has replaced COVID at 
the top of the mountain of concerns for 
the people from my State. 
Make no mistake about it—the infla-
tion harming checking accounts of 
Kansans 
and 
all 
Americans 
rests 
squarely on the shoulders of the social-
ist economic policies coming out of the 
White 
House, 
otherwise 
known 
as 
Bidenomics. 
As we all know, yesterday, the De-
partment of Labor reported consumer 
prices climbed for the third straight 
month, jumping over 5 percent in 
June—the largest increase in 13 years. 
Gas prices are up, groceries are up, cars 
and truck prices are up, home prices 
are up, paper products are up, utilities 
are up, and I could go on and on. 
Every day, we see the Bidenomics of 
inflation 
impacting 
hard-working 
Americans. In fact, inflation is a great 
social injustice. Inflation is really a re-
gressive tax. It hurts everyone but 
none more than our seniors and young, 
hard-working families living paycheck 
to paycheck. 
So what exactly is Bidenomics? Let’s 
look at what they did to create this 
crisis. Stating the obvious, they are 
printing money, borrowing money we 
don’t have, and implementing quan-
titative easing like there is no tomor-
row, like there are no generations of 
America for our future. 
Look no further than the cost of util-
ities. The administration has made it 
hard to use affordable, clean, tradi-
tional energy, and they leveled more 
and more regulations on the industry. 
Manufactured 
products? 
Ditto. 
Bidenomics is paying people more to 
stay at home than go to work, creating 
labor shortages and government-cre-
ated 
bottlenecks 
in 
manufacturing 
plants. And then, to top things off, we 
don’t even have enough truckdrivers to 
transport goods to market. 
As for gasoline, I bring your atten-
tion, which is up 31 percent since Janu-
ary, and according to AAA, it is ex-
pected to rise another 20 cents this 
summer. 
Let’s think about what all the ad-
ministration has done. They shut down 
the Keystone XL. They stopped drilling 
on government lands and imposed 
harmful rules and regulations to slow 
down drilling and make it more expen-
sive. We are now importing more oil 
from Russia than Alaska. 
As a physician in rural Kansas, I had 
the privilege of delivering a baby most 
every day, and one thing I always no-
ticed, when that price of gasoline got 
above $3 a gallon, all of a sudden, those 
moms were missing their appoint-
ments. Today, we are at that number, 
and we are expecting it to go even 
higher, unfortunately. Kansans aren’t 
the only ones feeling the squeeze at the 
pump. 
Many popular items we all regularly 
purchase at the grocery store increased 
in recent months. The cost of a typical 
all-American 
Kansas 
breakfast—two 
eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast, and or-
ange juice—is up almost 10 percent. 
Pre-COVID, we had the greatest 
economy in my lifetime, and that came 
about because we lowered people’s 
taxes, we lowered regulations, and we 
lowered energy prices. Now, out-of-con-
trol spending and socialist policies dic-
tated by the White House are leading 
to rampant inflation that shows no 
signs of stopping. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, America is in a debt crisis be-
cause of reckless government spending. 
Now, thanks to the insane spending 
and failed policies of President Joe 
Biden and Democrats in Washington, 
we are seeing higher and higher infla-
tion. 
Under the Biden administration, in-
flation has grown every month. Just 
look at this week’s CPI numbers. From 
June 2020 to June 2021, the Consumer 
Price Index rose 5.4 percent. Energy 
costs are up 24.5 percent, and gasoline 
prices are up 45 percent—nearly $1 
more from where they were last year. 
Inflation is at the highest rate since 
the great recession. This week’s Pro-
ducer Price Index data shows a 7.3-per-
cent increase in June and a historic 
22.6-percent jump in the prices of proc-
essed goods, the highest since 1975. For 
6 straight months, we have seen the 
data clearly shows that spending be-
yond our means has consequences. In-
flation is growing at the fastest rate 
since 1981. 
These aren’t just numbers or statis-
tics; these increases represent a grow-
ing pressure on Florida families and 
businesses. Every time prices rise, life 
gets harder. 
Last month, I met with business own-
ers in Miami and heard firsthand how 
their businesses were struggling with 
the rising price of goods. Every time I 
am home in Florida, I hear from fami-
lies who are noticing prices are up, gas 
prices are up, and food prices are up. 
Every price increase has a direct im-
pact on a family’s budget. 
When inflation goes up, it hurts ev-
eryone, especially our poor families, 
those on fixed incomes, and small busi-
nesses. I saw how hard it was for my 
parents to make ends meet when infla-
tion hit in the seventies. When food 
and gas prices went up, we had less 
food on the table. 
I remember going to the grocery 
store, when my mom took in ironing to

raise money every day for groceries, 
and she said: You have to look at the 
price of things because they are con-
stantly going up. 
That is happening again in Joe 
Biden’s America. Families in Florida 
and across our Nation are suffering be-
cause of the Democrats’ reckless spend-
ing spree led by Joe Biden. 
Just take a look around. Average 
prices of everything—everything is up. 
Let’s say families are filling up their 
tank once a week. If you drive a car, 
that means Joe Biden raised your ex-
penses $600 a year. If you drive a truck, 
that means Joe Biden raised your ex-
penses by more than $1,000 a year. And 
let’s remember, half of Americans 
make less than $35,000 a year. Inflation 
is a new tax on our families. 
Instead of addressing this crisis that 
has hurt Americans, Biden and the 
Democrats are living in an economic 
fantasyland where debt doesn’t matter, 
spending has no consequences, and in-
flation is impossible. They are ignoring 
the fact that our Nation is barreling 
towards $30 trillion in debt. That is 
$233,000 in debt for every family in 
America. 
Now Democrats in the Senate want 
to spend another $4 trillion of your 
money on a so-called infrastructure 
plan that has little to do with infra-
structure. They don’t care if Ameri-
cans get a return on their hard-earned 
tax dollars. 
But the truth is, we can’t keep spend-
ing like this. There will be a day of 
reckoning coming if we don’t act to get 
our fiscal house in order. That is why I 
have introduced legislation, the Fed-
eral Debt Emergency Control Act, to 
take real steps to rein in Washington’s 
out-of-control spending. That includes 
preventing Biden and the Democrats 
from mindlessly spending by requiring 
that two-thirds of the Senate vote to 
increase the debt before approving any 
bill with deficit spending. 
It would terminate any unobligated 
funding from the American Rescue 
Plan and any previous stimulus bills, 
sending it back to the Treasury Gen-
eral Fund for deficit reduction. 
Finally, it would ensure that any bill 
reducing the debt by at least 5 percent 
over 10 years is fast-tracked through 
the legislative process. 
We are in a debt crisis. This isn’t mo-
nopoly money; it is Americans’ money, 
and we have to be responsible with it. 
It is time to end the madness, and it is 
time to stand up for low- and fixed-in-
come families and for small businesses 
that bear the brunt of President 
Biden’s inflation crisis. With the debt 
ceiling suspension expiring on July 31, 
we must tackle these issues head-on 
and chart a new and fiscally respon-
sible path forward that protects fami-
lies and our Nation’s financial secu-
rity. 
I look forward to every fiscally re-
sponsible Republican and Democrat 
working with me to reject Biden’s in-
sane spending spree, quickly pass my 
bill, and protect the future of this Na-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that upon dis-
position of the Nanda nomination, the 
Senate resume consideration of the 
Liang nomination at 5:30 today and the 
Senate vote on the motions to invoke 
cloture on the Liang and Remy nomi-
nations in the order listed; further, I 
ask that the cloture motion on the 
Cunningham nomination ripen upon 
disposition of the Remy nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JOCELYN SAMUELS 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
was proud to vote to confirm Jocelyn 
Samuels to the Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission last year when 
she was confirmed in a bipartisan vote, 
and I am proud to do so again. 
The EEOC has a critical role to play 
in protecting workers’ rights and ad-
dressing inequities in our economy 
which disproportionately disadvantage 
women, people of color, people with 
disabilities, and more. For example, it 
is responsible for enforcing discrimina-
tion and harassment laws and works to 
address the gender pay gap. 
Workers need a champion at the 
EEOC fighting for them, and Ms. Sam-
uels has proven over her nearly two 
decades of experience with the Federal 
Government and her recent service as a 
Commissioner of the EEOC that she is 
that champion. 
From pushing to pass the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act as vice presi-
dent of education and employment at 
the National Women’s Law Center to 
leading civil rights efforts at the De-
partment of Justice and Department of 
Health and Human Services, to work-
ing as a staffer on the Senate Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee and a senior attorney at the 
EEOC, she has spent her career work-
ing to address discrimination and en-
sure no one is treated unfairly because 
of their age, sex, including sexual ori-
entation and gender identity, race, re-
ligion, or disability. 
I was pleased to see her nomination 
advanced out of our HELP Committee 
with bipartisan support, and I hope to 
see similar bipartisan support for her 
final confirmation. 
NOMINATION OF SEEMA NANDA 
Madam President, I would also like 
to urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting to confirm Seema Nanda as So-
licitor for the Department of Labor— 
another nominee who was advanced 
from the HELP Committee on a bipar-
tisan vote. 
Ms. Nanda has served in the Depart-
ment of Labor previously as Deputy 
Chief of Staff, Deputy Solicitor of 
Labor, and Chief of Staff. She pre-
viously served as a career attorney in 
the Department of Justice, where she 
fought to defend immigrant workers 
from discrimination and held employ-
ers accountable for unfair hiring prac-
tices. She has proven herself to be an 
excellent choice for this important 
role. 
We take some hard votes in this 
Chamber. These should not be among 
them. Workers are the backbone of our 
economy, and that means every one of 
us should be fighting for them and vot-
ing to confirm Commissioner Samuels 
and Ms. Nanda, who will fight for them 
as well. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING THE MEMORIES OF THE 
VICTIMS OF THE BUILDING COL-
LAPSE IN SURFSIDE, FLORIDA, 
ON JUNE 24, 2021, AND THE BRAV-
ERY AND SELFLESS SERVICE OF 
THE 
INDIVIDUALS 
WHO 
RE-
SPONDED TO THE BUILDING COL-
LAPSE 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I would like to thank my colleague 
Senator RUBIO for joining me to honor 
the lives lost in the horrific tragedy on 
June 24, when the Champlain Towers 
South condo building in Surfside, FL, 
suddenly collapsed in the middle of the 
night, and honor the brave men and 
women that have risked their lives in 
search, rescue, and recovery efforts. 
Senator RUBIO
and I were on the 
ground in Surfside following the col-
lapse, talking to families, first re-
sponders, and members of the commu-
nity. The pain these families are expe-
riencing is unimaginable. Those unex-
pectedly lost in this horrific tragedy 
were mothers, fathers, grandfathers 
and grandmothers, friends, aunts, un-
cles, and cousins. They were children 
and grandchildren with their full lives 
ahead of them. 
I can’t imagine losing any member of 
my family like this, but the thought of 
losing one of my grandchildren is too 
painful to imagine. We mourn with 
these families, and our hearts break for 
them. We continue to pray for the 
Surfside community, the families and 
loved ones of those lost, and all of 
those working tirelessly to serve the 
Surfside community. 
In the face of tremendous tragedy, 
our first responders ran into the dan-
ger. They are heroes. They imme-
diately answered the call to serve, and 
firefighters, law enforcement officers, 
rescue and recovery crews, emergency 
medical 
technicians, 
physicians, 
nurses, and others from across the 
State of Florida and the Nation came 
rushing to save them. 
When you meet with the first re-
sponders—I mean, they are working 
tirelessly trying to find somebody that 
has survived, and your heart goes out 
to them as they went from rescue to 
recovery. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, the 
Miami-Dade Police Department, the 
Surfside Police Department, and others 
from around the area were there every 
step of the way. 
Some of these responders lost family 
in the collapse; yet they still answered 
the call. We heard the absolutely dev-
astating story of a Miami-Dade fire-
fighter who carried the body of his own 
7-year-old daughter, Stella, away from 
the rubble. You just can’t even begin to 
imagine the pain and loss experienced 
by this father. 
International rescue crews and emer-
gency 
support 
organizations 
from 
Israel and Mexico also responded to the 
site to aid in the search and rescue ef-
forts. Numerous volunteer organiza-
tions responded, including the Red 
Cross, as well as community leaders 
and individuals offering resources, sup-
port, and comfort to the survivors and 
community in Surfside. 
Our Jewish community, particularly 
Orthodox Jews, have been especially af-
fected by this tragedy, and we thank 
CSE, Hatzalah, ZAKA, and all those 
who have worked selflessly to support 
our Jewish community. We can never 
thank these brave men and women 
enough for their bravery and deter-
mination in the face of this terrible 
tragedy. 
I know right now we all have a lot of 
unanswered questions. We are all going 
to work tirelessly to understand ex-
actly what happened. And while we 
can’t bring back the lives lost, I will 
always work to honor those lost and 
will be relentless in the search for an-
swers to make sure a tragedy like this 
never happens again. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 
300, submitted earlier today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 300) honoring the 
memories of the victims of the building col-
lapse in Surfside, Florida, on June 24, 2021, 
and the bravery and selfless service of the in-
dividuals who responded to the building col-
lapse. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the reso-
lution be agreed to, the preamble be 
agreed to, and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 300) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I appreciate the unanimous support of 
my Senate colleagues passing this reso-
lution to honor the lives lost in the 
horrific tragedy in Surfside, and I 
thank the many first responders for 
their incredible bravery in the search 
and rescue and recovery efforts. 
Our hearts are broken, but we stand 
together. Florida is ‘‘Surfside Strong.’’ 
I yield the floor.

GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, my col-
leagues, it is not a coincidence that in 
2020, gun sales in this country spiked 
by 40 percent. It is an extraordinary in-
crease in gun sales. And homicides in 
this country increased by 30 percent. 
Violent crime is increasing in the 
country. You can’t miss that if you 
turn on the news at night. 
And there can be no doubt that our 
Nation’s gun laws—the loosest and 
most loophole-ridden in the Nation— 
are a primary contributor to this spike 
in gun crime. 
I want to spend just a few minutes 
this afternoon making sure that all of 
my colleagues understand that if we 
want to do something about violent 
crime in this country, then you cannot 
continue to close your eyes to the fact 
that we are allowing criminals all 
across this country to traffic dan-
gerous weapons that are being used in 
gun homicides. 
First, let’s burst the bubble of the 
gun lobby. Their primary argument is 
that more guns keep people safer. Well,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4883 
July 14, 2021 
that is not true. It has never ever been 
true. Study after study tells you what 
your common sense should already tell 
you. In fact, one study makes it very 
plain. On a nearly one-for-one basis, 
the more guns you have in your com-
munity, the more crime you are going 
to have. 
One study said this. What they found 
was that for communities that saw a 1- 
percent increase in gun ownership— 
guess what they also saw. A cor-
responding 1-percent increase in gun 
homicides. Thus, it should surprise no 
one that as the number of guns in-
crease in this country, the number of 
gun crimes increase in this country. 
Now, there are a lot of reasons for 
that. But, again, you don’t have to 
surge deep into the data to understand 
why. Let me give you just one example. 
A family I am pretty close to in 
Hartford, CT, a young man named 
Shane Oliver was shot years ago right 
down the street from where I live in 
the capital city. And he was in an argu-
ment with some young men about 
things they said about his girlfriend, 
who happened to be with him. It just so 
happened that there was an illegal gun 
sitting in the front seat of one of these 
cars. An argument over a girl that in 
any other high-income nation in the 
world would have, at worst, resulted in 
some punches being thrown. In this 
neighborhood in Hartford, CT, it re-
sulted in a gun homicide. 
Shane Oliver doesn’t live on this 
Earth any longer. He was taken from 
his parents, Pastor Sam Saylor and his 
wife Janet, when he was 20 years old 
because there was an illegal gun that 
just happened to be sitting in the front 
seat of a car. In almost any other coun-
try in the world, there is not a gun sit-
ting in the front seat of another 20- 
year-old’s car in the middle of Hart-
ford, CT. Access to guns means more 
gun crime. 
But here is the other problem. We 
know there has been a 40-percent in-
crease in gun sales. But those aren’t 
just the sales that are reported to the 
criminal background check system. 
What we know is that somewhere 
around 20, 30 percent of all gun sales in 
this country don’t happen with a back-
ground check attached to it. Those are 
gun sales that very often are going 
straight to criminals and straight to 
gun traffickers. 
So if there has been a 40-percent in-
crease in background check transfers, 
there has likely also been a 40-percent 
increase in the number of guns that 
have been transferred to criminals and 
transferred to gun traffickers, the peo-
ple who are selling them to the folks 
who are going to use them in gun vio-
lence. 
Here is a study out of New York. The 
New York AG’s office recently re-
viewed aggregate gun trace informa-
tion for about 5 years, and what they 
found was that 74 percent of the recov-
ered guns in New York—normally re-
covered because they were used in a 
crime—came with a known source 
State that wasn’t New York. That is 
interesting, right? 
Three-quarters of the guns that are 
being used in crimes in New York 
aren’t being bought in New York. 
There is a reason for that. You have to 
go through a background check in New 
York if you want to buy a gun. And if 
you are a criminal, you can’t get a gun 
in New York at a gun store because 
they have background checks and be-
cause they don’t have internet sales or 
gun show sales without background 
checks either. 
What the AG’s office also found was 
that half of the guns that came from 
outside of New York came from six 
States—all six States with really weak 
gun laws—meaning there is this very 
intentional iron pipeline of guns in this 
country coming from States with no 
universal background checks, places 
where gun traffickers can go and buy 
guns at gun shows or online, and then 
bring them to States like New York or 
Connecticut or New Jersey and sell 
them on the black market. 
And what we also know is that there 
is a really short period of time between 
when these guns are being purchased 
and when they are being used in 
crimes, which shows an intentionality, 
which shows a very clear commercial 
market around the purchase of guns in 
places without background checks, the 
sale of those guns to potentially vio-
lent individuals, and the commission of 
crimes. 
Of the 1 million crime guns that were 
traced in this country between 2015 and 
2019, more than one-third were used in 
a crime within just 3 years of their ini-
tial retail sale. This short time-to- 
crime timeline is a strong indication 
that these guns were purchased with 
the intent to divert them for criminal 
use. 
So every year that goes by that we 
choose, as a Congress, to not close 
these loopholes, to not simply say that 
if you are going to buy a gun on a com-
mercial market in the United States, 
you just have to prove you are not a 
gun trafficker, is another year that we 
essentially endorse and facilitate the 
murder of thousands and thousands of 
Americans. 
And there is a clear connection be-
tween this increase in gun sales and 
this increase in criminal activity. 
Why? Because along with those legal 
gun sales come all sorts of gun sales 
that do an end around on the back-
ground check system. 
Now, thank goodness President Biden 
is doing something about this because 
there is a new loophole that criminals 
are taking advantage of, the ghost gun 
loophole. In California, today, 30 per-
cent 
of 
the 
confiscated 
guns 
are 
unserialized. Think of that. Thirty per-
cent of the guns being confiscated in 
California today by the ATF have no 
serial number on them. That is largely 
because of this new phenomena of 
ghost guns that are assembled from a 
kit, not guns that are purchased at a 
store. 
In Connecticut, a convicted felon who 
couldn’t have bought a gun at a gun 
store in Connecticut because he is a 
convicted felon used a ghost gun to 
shoot his girlfriend’s 15-year-old daugh-
ter and 16-year-old son before turning 
the gun on himself. People who know 
they can’t buy guns in gun stores or 
online in a place like Connecticut that 
has universal background checks are 
now assembling ghost guns and com-
mitting crimes. 
The Biden administration is taking 
action, but so should we. I come to the 
floor to share this with my colleagues 
because our constituents are concerned 
about the rising rate of gun homicides 
in this Nation. They expect us to do 
something about it. And I am not say-
ing that there is only one solution. I 
am not saying that changing our gun 
laws is the only step that we should 
take to try to do something about the 
rising rates of gun homicides in this 
country. There is a longer story as to 
why people have become so desperate 
as to resort to gun violence in order to 
mediate disputes or to project power. 
But the prevalence of so many more 
guns in our country today than just a 
year ago, the prevalence of so many 
more illegal guns due to intentional 
choices made by this body is a big part 
of the story. And I hope that we will be 
able to bring before this body bipar-
tisan legislation that will close those 
background check loopholes very soon 
to give this body a chance to do some-
thing about the rising rates of gun vio-
lence in this country. 
REMEMBERING WILLIAM VANDEN HEUVEL 
Mr. President, last month, the Na-
tion lost a great patriot, and I lost a 
great friend, William vanden Heuvel, 
and I come to the floor today to honor 
his impressive legacy. 
Bill vanden Heuvel grew up in a 
working-class family during the Great 
Depression, and his call to public serv-
ice came early in his life. As a child, he 
listened to President Roosevelt’s fire-
side chats, and he became obsessed 
with the idea that regular people can 
band together and build a just and 
compassionate country. 
So upon learning of FDR’s death, Bill 
hitchhiked alone to the Roosevelt es-
tate to try to attend the funeral. He 
was 
14 
years 
old. 
Now, 
he 
was 
unsurprisingly, initially, turned away, 
but somehow he found his way to Elea-
nor Roosevelt, who was so impressed 
with the young man’s passion for her 
husband’s legacy that she welcomed 
the 14-year-old in. 
In many ways, it is a story that is 
emblematic of Bill’s life. He grew close 
to several prominent American lead-
ers—from the Kennedys to Jimmy Car-
ter, to diplomats and officials the 
world over—not by accident or thanks 
to any privilege that he was born into, 
but just because of his effectiveness; 
his tenacity; and his unbridled, infec-
tious, contagious love for his country. 
As a young attorney in the Kennedy 
Justice Department, Bill was given a 
really difficult task: help integrate

Prince Edward County, which at the 
time was blatantly flouting Brown v. 
Board of Education requirements. Rob-
ert Kennedy, then-Attorney General, 
personally tracked Bill’s work, noticed 
his record of success in integrating 
Maryland’s schools, and the two be-
came close friends. 
There was another leader, Jimmy 
Carter, who had asked Bill to represent 
America abroad as Ambassador to the 
European Office of the United Nations, 
which kicked off Bill’s storied diplo-
matic career. His diplomatic accom-
plishments are too long to go through 
in one speech, but through his work, he 
became a vocal and prominent advo-
cate for the United Nations and the 
work that it does to address pressing 
global issues. 
Bill also remained committed to 
solving problems at home. He was a 
renaissance man, a true polymath, and 
a staunch civil rights advocate. For 
years, he helped lead the charge in New 
York City to reform its prisons. He be-
came a crusader in the city. He tackled 
the squalid conditions of confinement, 
and he feared no one in his efforts to 
speak for the voiceless and make sure 
that even the most hardened criminals 
were treated like human beings. It is a 
big part of his legacy as well. 
And in his later life, when I got to 
know him, he returned to his first love. 
Bill vanden Heuvel started and led the 
Franklin Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, 
and he championed the long fight to es-
tablish the Four Freedoms Park on 
Roosevelt Island. That park will stand 
forever as a testament to both the maj-
esty of Franklin Roosevelt and the pa-
triotism of Bill vanden Heuvel. 
Finally, though an obituary of a 
great man like Bill is filled with public 
accomplishment, for his friends and 
family, it is his private accomplish-
ment which defined his true greatness. 
His wife Melinda and his daughters, 
Katrina and Wendy, and his step-
children, Ashley and John, know him 
as a kind and loving husband and fa-
ther. And the literally thousands of 
young public servants and reformers 
and diplomats that he mentored over 
the years, they are grateful for the 
time he took to midwife the hopes and 
dreams of others. 
I am one of these people. Bill took 
me under his wing early in my public 
service career. It is his advice I turned 
to over and over, especially in my early 
years in Congress, as I set my own 
course and picked my own battles. So, 
above all, Bill’s family and friends will 
miss him dearly. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, first I 
want to recognize my colleague from 
Connecticut, his moving tribute to a 
great American, and also thank him 
for his steadfast leadership on issues of 
gun safety in this country. 
I am standing here with my col-
leagues today to talk about what is 
going on in this country around em-
powering children. We have a big thing 
happening tomorrow with the vast ma-
jority of families with kids across the 
country. 
As of tomorrow, they will start see-
ing more money in their bank accounts 
every year for the rest of the year. 
These payments are the result of 
changes that we have made to the child 
tax credit, which was signed into law 
by President Biden as part of the 
American Rescue Plan because of the 
changes we advocated for. 
What President Biden made law, 
more families and children are going to 
benefit from the child tax credit. More 
than ever before in history, in fact, 
this will be the greatest cut in overall 
child poverty in the history of America 
for this coming year. 
So starting tomorrow, 90 percent of 
kids in America—90 percent of their 
families across the country—will start 
to see these payments for the rest of 
this year, up to $300 for every child in 
a household under 6 and $250 for every 
child in the household ages 6 through 
17. For families in suburbs and cities 
and rural areas, for families across the 
country, this policy is transformative. 
For the family of people with essen-
tial workers in Florida, the grand-
mother raising three children in Cali-
fornia, a single mom in Pennsylvania 
working the same job for 20 years, for 
a parent in Utah—you can go on and on 
and on—this is one of the most trans-
formative policy changes made in our 
Nation in more than a century. 
This policy means stability. It means 
help is on the way. It means hope is 
here. 
In my home State, Margarita from 
Passaic, NJ, who is raising three kids 
on her own while working two jobs, one 
before sunrise, starting tomorrow, she 
will see hundreds of dollars a month to 
help her pay the electric bill, help her 
make rent, and help her children suc-
ceed in school. 
For the family of two educators with 
kids in New York, tomorrow is trans-
formative. Washington State, North 
Dakota, 
blue 
State, 
so-called 
red 
State—all over this country, we are 
seeing a transformation. 
This is what a mom from Kansas 
said: 
[This child tax credit] would help so much 
for single moms like me to be able to feel se-
cure as a parent. If at any time something 
were to happen to me, such as a car repair, 
a doctor visit, even a book fair for my chil-
dren, I am just not making enough to have 
any extra for anything other than bills. 
Shoes and coats, maybe a ball glove. Karate 
or dance lessons to improve social skills and 
athletic abilities and teach children team-
work would be possible; [and] maybe even at 
Christmas since they didn’t get one in 2020. 
For middle-class families trying to 
stay afloat, lower income families des-
perate to make ends meet, and families 
living in poverty struggling to put food 
on the table, tomorrow is a new start. 
For millions of Americans across the 
country, from this body, our President, 
tomorrow will begin a historically un-
paralleled moment. 
Senator 
BROWN, 
Senator 
BENNET, 
Senator WARNOCK, and I, along with 
our House colleagues, are going to con-
tinue to do what must be done. This 
change for this year—cutting child 
poverty, empowering millions of fami-
lies, 90 percent of whom with kids will 
see a benefit—we must make this per-
manent. I will fight alongside my col-
leagues to see that this is not a one- 
time benefit for 1 year but a permanent 
change that we—change our status. We 
are the 36th wealthiest Nation on the 
planet, and we are 4th from the bottom 
in child poverty. We are second to last 
in terms of child allowances. We in 
America have to make this country 
live up to its promise to every child 
that we are the cornerstone of the idea 
of the American dream; that we are the 
most fertile soil for which a child could 
thrive; that we love our children not 
just in words but in the policies we 
make. This is a historic moment. 
The one thing I will say to anyone 
listening to my words, because, as my 
colleague knows, some families are eli-
gible but might not benefit, please, we 
need to make sure that portal—that 
people know to go to childtaxcredit.gov 
to get the information. All of us have 
an obligation to help everyone avail 
themselves of this policy. I believe, 
God willing, we will make it perma-
nent. 
I now turn to my colleague Senator 
BENNET from Colorado, Mr. President, 
with your permission. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, we are 
all here today—I want to say on this 
floor how much I love my colleagues 
from New Jersey and from Ohio who 
are here with me today on the floor to 
celebrate this incredibly important 
milestone. 
I love you for your commitment to 
the country and for your commitment 
to our kids. 
I want to wish your brother well be-
cause I know that he is recovering 
from his stroke, and you are still tak-
ing time to be here on the floor to 
make sure that people who need it the 
most hear about this tax credit. I want 
to thank you for that. 
I have heard the Senator from Ohio, 
just like the Senator from New Jersey, 
talk about the lives of real people in 
their States. I have sat in the chair 
where the Presiding Officer is, listen-
ing to Senator BROWN talk about fami-
lies in Ashtabula or Zanesville or Day-
ton or Cleveland or Cincinnati or To-
ledo and what the policies that we pass 
in this body either—you know, the dif-
ference they make or very often the 
difference they don’t make to real peo-
ple at home, to the people you work for 
and represent in Newark. 
I think about a mom, I say to my col-
league from Colorado, the Presiding Of-
ficer, a mom in Rifle, CO, who was in 
an early childhood center there, and 
she was so happy to be there. The other

July 14, 2021 
moms were happy to be there, too, be-
cause until they had that early child-
hood center, they had to drive 30 miles 
to Glenwood Canyon to get to Glen-
wood Springs to put their kid in 
daycare so they could work, and now 
they could actually have it in their 
community. What she said to me was 
this: I work so I can have health insur-
ance. Every single dollar I make goes 
to pay for this early childhood center 
so I can work. 
It is that triangle that so many 
Americans are caught in because we 
have had an economy that for 50 years 
has worked really well for the top 10 
percent and not for anybody else in 
America. For too long, it seemed like 
Washington wasn’t paying any atten-
tion to that. I mean, what was our so-
lution to that? To spend $5.6 trillion on 
two wars in the Middle East that lasted 
for 20 years? To come to this floor to 
cut taxes not for working people, not 
for the people who needed it, but for 
the wealthiest people in the country at 
a time when our income inequality was 
higher than it was at any time since 
before the Great Depression? It made 
no sense. 
It was like if the mayor of Denver— 
who the Presiding Officer used to be, so 
let’s just imagine that for a second—it 
is as if the mayor of Denver said to the 
people of Denver: We are going to bor-
row more money than we have ever 
borrowed. 
I would say, as a concerned citizen of 
Denver, to the mayor: That worries 
me. I would like to know what you are 
spending it on. Are you spending it on 
parks? 
Nope. 
Mental health services? We certainly 
need those. 
Nope. 
Homeless? 
Nope. 
Our roads and our bridges? 
No. 
Schools? 
No. 
You are borrowing all this money. 
What are you spending it on? 
The mayor would have said: Well, I 
am going to give the money we are bor-
rowing to the two richest neighbor-
hoods in Denver and expect that some-
how it is going to trickle down to ev-
erybody else. 
That sounds crazy, but that was the 
Bush tax policy. That is the Trump tax 
policy, sixty-five percent of that bill 
for what he called the middle class 
going to the top 5 percent in America. 
That is why this is such a new day. 
I have said on this floor before that it 
is long past time that we started treat-
ing America’s children like they are 
our children and that we wouldn’t ac-
cept the conditions so many kids live 
in unless we thought they were some-
one else’s children. 
This country, as the Senator from 
New Jersey has said before, is 38 out of 
41 industrialized countries in terms of 
childhood poverty. In other words, we 
have the 38th worst childhood poverty 
in the industrialized world. Only three 
countries are worse than we are. The 
poorest population in America? Our 
children. And we have some of the low-
est economic mobility of any country 
in the industrialized world. We tell our-
selves we are the land of opportunity, 
but we haven’t looked like that for a 
very long time, and the policies that 
have been passed here haven’t helped. 
That is where the child tax credit 
comes into being. 
We increased it to $3,000, $3,600 for 
kids under the age of 6. We made it 
fully refundable so the poorest kids, 
the millions of poor kids who have 
never benefited from the tax credit be-
fore because their parents made too lit-
tle money, now have the benefit of it, 
and it is going to be paid out starting 
tomorrow on a monthly basis. So when 
families are making decisions about 
how to pay the rent, put a little food 
on the table, buy a few hours of 
daycare so that they can stay at work 
and earn a living, they will be able to 
do it. So they can work, as the Senator 
from Ohio so eloquently said, with dig-
nity. 
In my view, this should be just the 
beginning of creating an economy that, 
when it grows, grows for everybody, 
not just for the people at the very top. 
It strengthens our democracy by giving 
everybody a sense that they have a real 
stake in the economy and that their 
kids are going to be able to live a 
brighter life than the life they live. 
That is what it is supposed to be in 
America. 
I am grateful to stand here today 
with my two colleagues and with the 
Presiding Officer to say that finally, fi-
nally, with this President, we are 
treating America’s children like they 
are America’s children, and we don’t 
have to accept chronic childhood pov-
erty as a chronic feature of our econ-
omy or our democracy. We can have an 
ambition that is greater than that for 
our country and for our children, and 
we can say to our kids: You are impor-
tant to us. In some ways, you are all 
that matter to us, and the position we 
put you in to be able to get an edu-
cation and contribute to society and 
help lead the country, participate in 
our economy, in our democracy, that is 
our priority, and that is what we care 
about. 
I think that is President Biden’s pri-
ority, and he has reflected it incredibly 
well in this policy. 
I will turn it over to the Senator 
from Ohio just by saying that now we 
have to do the very hard and important 
work of making this a permanent part 
of our Tax Code so that we cut child-
hood poverty permanently in half in 
this country. I would like us to end 
childhood poverty in the United States. 
I think that would be a very worthy as-
piration for all of us to have. 
With that, I yield the floor to my 
wonderful colleague from Ohio, who 
has been an incredible leader on this 
from even before I was in the Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. MICHAEL BENNET, thank 
you. You said this is a new day. I loved 
how you set that up. The mayor of 
Denver gets a tax cut or at least pours 
money into the richest neighborhoods 
in Denver, expecting that to trickle 
down or trickle out to help other 
neighborhoods and other people. It ob-
viously doesn’t work that way any 
more than the—I was going to say the 
Bush tax cut, but it has been their 
playbook for years. Whenever they get 
a majority, they give a tax cut to rich 
people, arguing it will trickle down. It 
never does. Senator BOOKER has been so 
articulate about that. As you say, Sen-
ator BENNET, it is a new day for this 
country. 
I think the three of us think—and I 
think that Senator HICKENLOOPER, the 
Presiding Officer, has thought this, as 
have most Members of the Senate— 
that this is perhaps the most impor-
tant thing we have done in this Senate 
in 25 years. 
Tomorrow, parents across the coun-
try will check their bank accounts. Not 
all of them are going to know what 
CORY BOOKER, MICHAEL BENNET, and all 
of us did, but they are going to see, 
most importantly in many ways— 
maybe my religious faith teaches me 
this. It is almost better that these peo-
ple have these—they get these checks 
in Cleveland and Akron and Mansfield, 
and they have no idea how they got 
them. They didn’t know I had anything 
to do it as their Senator; they just 
know their lives are better. 
Families will see $250 or $300 direct- 
deposited into their accounts every 
month for the next 6 months, and then 
they get the rest of the year in a lump 
sum. Then, as Senator BENNET
and 
Senator BOOKER said, it is up to us to 
make this permanent. 
In my State, 92 percent of the kids in 
the State are eligible. We have a great 
majority—at least, we think, 90 per-
cent of them will see these checks this 
week either in their bank account or in 
their mailbox. We have to make sure 
we get the other children who are eligi-
ble. Their parents may not have filed a 
tax return, and those families need to 
go to childtaxcredit.gov to make sure 
they get this benefit. 
Even before this pandemic, we all 
know hard work wasn’t paying off for 
millions of workers. We have seen in 
the last 20 years that productivity has 
gone up. Corporate profits have ex-
ploded. CEO pay has soared almost un-
imaginably. Yet wages have essentially 
been flat. That has gone on for decades 
even though the cost of everything is 
up, especially the cost of raising chil-
dren. 
Our child tax credit recognizes the 
fact that raising children is work. It 
happens to be the most—maybe it is 
not compensated the same way, but it 
happens to be the most important work 
any family can do. But from childcare 
to health insurance, to transportation, 
we have seen that a hard day’s work 
doesn’t begin to cover expenses for so 
many parents, and even middle-class 
families don’t feel stable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4886 
July 14, 2021 
As a result, 2 weeks ago, we were out 
of session, and I spent the week in Fre-
mont, in Defiance, in Cleveland, and in 
Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Youngs-
town, and Toledo talking to people 
about the child tax credit. The stories 
I heard from people—these were mostly 
parents who will benefit. These are 
some community activists whose kids 
may have been grown or don’t have 
kids. But the stories I heard, things 
like—Senator BENNET and I had a dis-
cussion with people from Denver and 
Cleveland one day on Zoom a couple 
weeks ago, too, and we heard over and 
over that parents were saying: Every 
month we just have to figure out, dur-
ing the last week of the month, how 
are we going to pay our rent. 
Now those families will have a little 
more comfort in knowing and less anx-
iety knowing they will be able to make 
their rent payment. 
I heard a number of parents say: 
Well, now I can send my son, for the 
first time, to scout camp or to day 
camp during the summer. Other par-
ents said: I don’t have to choose be-
tween the food we need to buy and buy-
ing diapers. I don’t have to reuse dia-
pers. 
All the kinds of stories, we heard. 
People were saying: I don’t have to 
work that second job and be away at 
night. I can get daycare on my regular 
job and get the benefits and have a lit-
tle money so that I can do these 
things. 
And the stories are as limitless as 
the number of people who are involved. 
And maybe the best part of this—and 
MICHAEL and CORY and I have talked 
about it. Maybe the best part of this is 
we have SNAP benefits. We know that 
is important for hungry families. We 
know the hungry people and the chil-
dren especially. We do the rental as-
sistance, emergency rental. We know 
how important that is. But these dol-
lars—this $250 or $300 a month, it goes 
to families, and they make the decision 
about what they need. I don’t make it. 
The senior Senator or the junior Sen-
ator—even though the junior Senator 
is older, right, than the senior Sen-
ator? I am confused. 
But the Senators from Colorado don’t 
make the decision. The Senator from 
New Jersey and I don’t make the deci-
sion. These decisions are made by the 
mothers and fathers who go to their 
mailbox and get this check or see it in 
their direct payment. 
So we know that this is not just good 
for those families. It means dollars in 
their pockets. It means they can make 
decisions they couldn’t have made. It 
means they can build a foundation for 
their own children to have more oppor-
tunity—all of that. But this is also 
really good for the community. It 
means more dollars are spent at local 
restaurants, more dollars are spent at 
local stores. So that is an important 
part of this, too, that it will help to lift 
up our economy. 
Families aren’t putting this money 
in a Swiss bank account, unlike the tax 
cuts that Senator BENNET talked about 
with the Trump tax cuts that every Re-
publican supported, virtually, and that 
blew a hole in the budget. That money 
was put in Swiss bank accounts. It 
doesn’t trickle down. This money is 
spent in the community. 
This is how we grow the economy. 
This is how we invest in the people who 
make it work. We don’t shovel tax cuts 
to the very top and hope it trickles 
down. We know it never does. With 
these tax credits, we show parents and 
workers: We are on your side. 
We won’t stop fighting until these 
tax credits are permanent. Senators 
BOOKER and BENNET have talked pas-
sionately and persuasively about that. 
I would add a couple other thanks 
here. Two of my staff are sitting in the 
back of this hall, Katie Mulhall and 
Chad Bolt, who have made this tax, 
working with Senator BENNET’s and 
Senator 
BOOKER’s 
and 
Senator 
WARNOCK’s staff—in making these tax 
cuts to reduce the poverty rate and 
making this happen this session with 
President Biden’s active support. 
I also would call out two staff people, 
one of whom is still in the office and 
one who is now working in the House of 
Representatives, Jeremy Hekhuis and 
Gideon Bragin, who began work on this 
in 2013, when we first started working 
with ROSA DELAURO and the work that 
she had done. I thank all of them for 
making this happen. 
I especially thank my colleagues 
from Colorado and Georgia and New 
Jersey. We keep fighting to give these 
families the peace of mind that these 
tax credits will be there for them up 
until their children are 18 so they can 
raise their kids with a little less anx-
iety and a little more comfort and a 
whole lot more opportunity. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I just 
was so inspired by—I am only going to 
be 
1 
minute—something 
Senator 
BROWN said in his remarks about his 
staff that I also want to mention Char-
lie Anderson, who is no longer with me 
because he quit me to go work for the 
administration. But if it hadn’t been 
for him, I would be very surprised if we 
would all be here today. So I wanted to 
say thank you to Charlie for never giv-
ing up on this and for holding me ac-
countable as we did the work together. 
I also am not going to address the 
issue about junior versus senior Sen-
ators from Colorado, just to observe 
what a wonderful delegation it is we 
have from the State of Colorado. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID H. CHIPMAN 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I come to 
the floor today to oppose the confirma-
tion 
of 
David 
Chipman, 
President 
Biden’s nominee for Director of the Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives. 
Many Hoosiers are concerned about 
the nomination of Mr. Chipman, and 
rightfully so. His statements have 
made one thing clear: If confirmed, he 
will fail to uphold the constitutional 
right to bear arms. 
He has stated under oath that he sup-
ports mandatory Federal registration 
of common semiautomatic firearms 
and ultimately supports a ban on AR– 
15 rifles. 
Semiautomatic sporting rifles can be 
found in the homes of millions of law- 
abiding Americans, Hoosiers included, 
who use them for hunting, recreational 
shooting, and defending their families. 
The ATF has a responsibility to 
clearly articulate its decisions to the 
public. In his confirmation hearing, 
Mr. Chipman revealed that he is not 
able to articulate what an assault rifle 
even is. His beliefs represent, in my 
opinion, a direct attack on our Second 
Amendment rights. 
It is no surprise that organizations 
that have never opposed an ATF nomi-
nee before are loudly opposing the 
nomination of David Chipman. 
Mr. Chipman’s nomination comes as 
the ATF is already in need of more ac-
countability for politicized decisions. 
American gun owners, manufacturers, 
and small business owners deserve clar-
ity and the right to appeal politicized 
decisions made by the ATF. 
Currently, the ATF engages in a se-
cretive, behind-the-scenes classifica-
tion review process to decide if a fire-
arm will be regulated by the National 
Firearms Act. No law-abiding Amer-
ican should have to wonder if they are 
going to suddenly be made a criminal 
by a bureaucratic decision. It doesn’t 
make sense. 
That is why I joined Representative 
DAN CRENSHAW in the House to intro-
duce the ATF Accountability Act. 
Law-abiding gun manufacturers and 
small businesses should be able to ap-
peal the legal status of classifications 
within a regular timeframe. 
I yield the floor at this time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my friend and colleague Sen-
ator BRAUN for leading this important 
discussion 
on 
protecting 
Second 
Amendment rights for Montanans and 
for all Americans. 
Today, President Biden and CHUCK 
SCHUMER are propping up yet another 
very controversial nominee, one who 
far from unites us as Americans—rath-
er, another nominee who divides us fur-
ther. Sadly, we are witnessing a com-
plete disregard for our Constitution. 
The Constitution could not be clear-
er. Now, I know my Democratic col-
leagues may want to say it otherwise, 
but it is clear—it is very clear when it 
says—and I have my pocket Constitu-
tion here. It says, ‘‘the right of the 
people to keep and bear Arms, shall not 
be infringed.’’ It is very strong and 
very clear language. Montanans and 
the American people are guaranteed 
this right, as protected in our Con-
stitution. 
Despite this, we have seen President 
Biden and far-left Democrats abandon

this right to fit their own gun-grabbing 
agenda. Their latest attack on the Sec-
ond Amendment is the nomination of a 
registered anti-gun lobbyist, who has 
called for the ban of certain firearms, 
to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms. This is the very agency 
that oversees firearms. 
It is unbelievable. Putting David 
Chipman in charge of the ATF is like 
putting an arsonist in charge of the 
fire department. He has a very hostile 
record toward the Second Amendment, 
and this hostile record against law- 
abiding gun owners speaks loud and 
clear. 
It is interesting to look at the 2020 
data that is coming in. Forty percent 
of the firearms sold in our country last 
year were to first-time buyers of a fire-
arm—40 percent. Why? The American 
people want to be able to defend them-
selves. 
As we are seeing the far left push to 
defund law enforcement, defund the po-
lice, and we see the anarchy going on 
across the cities of America, the law-
lessness, the high murder rates, the vi-
olence, it is no wonder that more 
Americans now say: I want to own a 
firearm myself to protect myself. 
If confirmed, Mr. Chipman would 
help the Democrats push their gun- 
grabbing agenda. We can’t allow the 
left to continue this attack on our pre-
cious 
constitutional 
rights. 
David 
Chipman would be a disaster to the 
Second Amendment rights of Mon-
tanans and all Americans. The Senate 
must oppose Mr. Chipman’s nomina-
tion for the sake of protecting our Sec-
ond Amendment rights. 
We must also pass some common-
sense legislation that protects the Sec-
ond Amendment, like what Senator 
BRAUN of Indiana is trying to do with 
his ATF Accountability Act. I support 
him in his efforts to pass this common-
sense legislation. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in 
opposing Mr. Chipman’s nomination to 
lead the ATF and encourage my col-
leagues to pass and support Senator 
BRAUN’s ATF Accountability Act. 
I yield back my time to the Senator 
from Indiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1920 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, here in a 
moment, I am going to ask for unani-
mous consent on the ATF Account-
ability Act and the Protecting the 
Right to Keep and Bear Arms Act. 
Governor Cuomo has declared gun vi-
olence a public health emergency in 
New York. ‘‘We want to do with gun vi-
olence what we just did with COVID,’’ 
Governor Cuomo says. 
During 
the 
pandemic, 
Governor 
Cuomo and other elected officials used 
the public health emergency to in-
fringe upon Americans’ constitutional 
rights. They barred Americans from ex-
ercising their freedom of religion by 
closing churches. They infringed upon 
Americans’ right to assemble by ban-
ning many gatherings, and now gun 
control activist organizations are pres-
suring President Biden to declare gun 
violence as a public health emergency. 
Doing so would allow the administra-
tion to take Executive action to hold 
up gun sales. 
Declaring a public health emergency 
should not give the executive branch 
the right to infringe upon our Second 
Amendment. This is why I introduced 
the Protecting the Right to Keep and 
Bear Arms Act to stop this. This bill 
would prevent the White House from 
declaring an emergency for the purpose 
of imposing gun control. 
I took an oath to represent Hoosiers 
and protect their Second Amendment 
rights. That is why I will oppose the 
nomination of David Chipman and why 
I will ask for unanimous consent to 
pass the ATF Accountability Act and 
the Protecting the Right to Keep and 
Bear Arms Act. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Judiciary Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 1920 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. I read this bill, and I 
am not sure the Senator from Indiana 
really wants to do what this bill says 
because the bill makes it a priority 
that this Agency, Alcohol, Tobacco, 
and Firearms—a priority if there is a 
request from a licensed manufacturer, 
importer, or dealer, a request of the 
Agency for information questions on 
regulatory matters, puts timelines on 
them, deadlines. 
It says that the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives—the 
Attorney 
General 
shall—shall—not 
later than 90 days after the receipt of 
such a request or question make a rul-
ing or determination. 
Well, you think to yourself, if this 
Agency has very little to do with thou-
sands of employees, then perhaps the 
timeliness of response from the indus-
try would merit some 90-day deadline. 
But the Senator in introducing this 
completely overlooks the obvious. This 
legislation would force ATF to take re-
sources and manpower away from their 
other activities and put them into an-
swering regulatory inquiries with a 90- 
day deadline in his bill. 
So what are the other duties that 
will be taking the ATF agents away 
from? Well, the Senator is from Indi-
ana, my neighboring State, and I am 
sure when he goes to northwestern In-
diana, he hears a lot about the city of 
Chicago. Well, it was last weekend, on 
the Fourth of July weekend, that there 
were 104 people shot in the city of Chi-
cago, 19 died. There were 13 children 
who were shot and two law enforce-
ment agents. 
What is the responsibility of the Al-
cohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
sives Bureau when it comes to this 
kind of mass shooting that is taking 
place in the city I am honored to rep-
resent but breaks my heart to hear 
those numbers? 
They are supposed to be inves-
tigating the gun violence. They are 
supposed to be gathering the informa-
tion and evidence so they can work 
with the prosecutors to stop this mass 
shooting. Unfortunately, the Senator 
from Indiana said, no, that is not your 
priority at ATF; your priority is to an-
swer regulatory questions from gun 
dealers and manufacturers. And you 
have 90 days to do it, no matter what 
else is going on. Oh, you may be going 
after somebody who is guilty in a mass 
killing and a mass shooting; put it 
aside. You have a bookkeeping ques-
tion. That is one of the provisions in 
here. You have a bookkeeping question 
that should take priority over any-
thing else you are doing. Stop pre-
paring information and evidence for 
trial, answer the industry questions on 
regulations. That is your highest pri-
ority—at least that is what your bill 
says. 
So I look at this, and I think, in the 
reality of gun violence and death and 
the crimes that are being committed, 
ATF has the most important role of 
keeping us safe. I want them to be effi-
cient in dealing with the industry. But 
that is not their highest priority, as far 
as I am concerned. The highest priority 
is to keep America safe and to do some-
thing about gun violence. And for that 
reason, I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The objection is heard. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, a 
quick response to that before I ask 
unanimous consent on the next item is 
that that is an argument I hear so 
often, that the city that supports some 
of the toughest State gun laws and 
local laws that ends up having the sta-
tistics that no one would want to have 
across our country and then would try 
to cast that blame on a neighboring 
State tells me that you are looking in 
the wrong place to solve the problem. 
The ATF here, we are just wanting 
clarity—that is the purpose of this act, 
and I suggest that my friend from Illi-
nois look at some of the more basic 
issues that might be underlying what 
is happening there. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1916 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 1916 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration; further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4888 
July 14, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Let me say, initially, I 
did not mention the issue of the source 
of crime guns in Illinois. The Senator 
from Indiana raised it. And since he 
did, I want to make a record of it. 
When we trace the crime guns in Illi-
nois, we find an alarming percentage of 
them coming from gun shows in your 
State right next to Illinois. The bad 
guys get on the Skyway, drive over to 
northwest Indiana gun shows and buy 
guns at those shows without back-
ground checks and come back and com-
mit crime in Chicago and other neigh-
borhoods. 
That is a fact. You may not like it; I 
certainly don’t like it. But we ought to 
be doing something about that instead 
of worrying about the gun manufactur-
ers and the gun salesmen and whether 
or not they are going to get special 
treatment from this Agency. 
But let me address the second matter 
that is before us, and this is Senator 
BRAUN’s request for S. 1916, Protecting 
the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. I 
want to set the record straight at the 
outset. Current Federal law, the Staf-
ford Act, prohibits the Federal Govern-
ment from seizing lawfully owned guns 
during a period of a major disaster or 
emergency. It is on the books. That is 
the law. 
The Stafford Act is also clear that 
during a major disaster emergency, the 
Federal Government is prohibited from 
creating new registration requirements 
for guns, new prohibitions on gun pos-
session, or new prohibitions on the law-
ful carrying of firearms. That is on the 
books already. So current law already 
protects guns that people own legally 
during periods of disaster or emer-
gency. But the Senator’s bill goes 
much further than that. 
Section 4 of the bill would amend the 
Stafford Act—get this—to say that the 
Federal Government also cannot pro-
hibit the manufacture or sale or trans-
fer of guns or ammunition during a dis-
aster or emergency. There are several 
problems with this. 
First, current law has exceptions 
that allow the government to continue 
enforcing laws already on the books 
during a disaster. This includes laws 
that prohibit convicted felons from 
possessing guns. Your bill does not 
make that exception. I am sure you 
don’t want to do that. I hope you will 
look at your bill. In other words, under 
the bill, as I read it, during a major 
disaster or emergency, the government 
would be barred from any prohibition 
of gun sales, even from enforcing the 
current prohibition on the sale of guns 
to convicted felons. 
That doesn’t make sense. I am sure 
that is not what want you want to do, 
but that is what your bill says. I hope 
it is not what you intended, and I am 
sure it is not. So please look at it care-
fully. 
There are also legitimate reasons 
why the government might need to 
temporarily prohibit guns being sold in 
a disaster area. Here is something that 
is not outlandish. Suppose the back-
ground check system has been knocked 
offline in a disaster area. We wouldn’t 
want felons taking advantage of that 
situation to walk into a gun dealer and 
buy guns that they are ineligible to 
buy. 
Current law ensures that the govern-
ment can’t take anyone’s lawfully 
owned guns away from them during a 
disaster, but there is no clear justifica-
tion for granting untouchable status to 
gun sales during the disaster. This bill 
needs some work. I hope we will not 
pass it in a hasty manner. And in light 
of these and other concerns, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID CHIPMAN 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
David Chipman is the nominee for the 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
sives Agency. I know a bit about him 
because he went through the Agency 
process. He is a veteran of over 20 years 
working for this Agency. We need him. 
I will tell you why we need him. 
In the history of the Alcohol, To-
bacco, Firearms and Explosives Agen-
cy, there has only been one person who 
has served—I believe it is from your 
State of Minnesota. There is only one 
person who served as the confirmed Di-
rector of the Agency. Otherwise, over 
and over again, it goes without any 
leadership. You say: Well, is that just 
an accident that this Agency never has 
a Director? I don’t think it is an acci-
dent at all. 
You see, the gun lobby, when they 
want to make their case against new 
gun laws, always say the same thing: 
‘‘Well, just enforce the laws on the 
books. You don’t need new laws. En-
force the laws on the books.’’ 
If you bought that premise, then the 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
sives Agency is one of the agencies 
that does that. So if you can weaken 
this Agency—fewer agents, fewer em-
ployees, fewer supervisors, no Direc-
tor—then the actual enforcement that 
is being done by this Agency is dimin-
ished. 
So, now, President Biden brings us 
Mr. Chipman. There are two parts of 
his career that should be noted: Over 20 
years at ATF, involved in some of the 
most serious investigations, and did an 
incredible job. After he left the ATF, 
he went to work for a gun safety group. 
He is the first one to tell you: ‘‘I own 
a gun, and I respect your Second 
Amendment rights and my Second 
Amendment rights, but I don’t want 
guns to get into the hands of the wrong 
people, and that is how I would run the 
ATF.’’ 
I think that reflects what the major-
ity of Americans think. Second Amend-
ment rights—I honor them, I respect 
them, they are in the law, decided by 
the Supreme Court in the Heller deci-
sion, but when it comes to guns—and I 
look at the wanton violence taking 
place. I don’t want guns getting into 
the hands of convicted felons. No, I 
don’t. I don’t think they have any Sec-
ond Amendment right, neither does 
David Chipman. But the people behind 
the gun lobby, gun industry don’t want 
an Agency that actually enforces those 
laws. They really don’t. And so they 
are trying to stop his nomination. 
It may be controversial, but I hope 
he gets this job. I am going to vote for 
him. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
morning, our friends in Europe claimed 
first place in the race against climate 
change. The European Union has laid 
out a plan to decarbonize Europe and 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55 
percent at the end of this decade. It is 
an ambitious plan, and it is one that 
will, in the words of EU climate policy 
chief Frans Timmermans, ‘‘give hu-
manity a fighting chance.’’ 
To our allies in Europe, I want to 
say: America stands with you in this 
effort, and we welcome the friendly 
competition to see who can move 
quickest to save our planet. 
Earlier today, President Biden joined 
members of the Senate Democratic 
caucus to discuss our historic budget 
proposal that was unveiled last night. 
It is a proposal designed, first and fore-
most, to help working families and sec-
ondly—and not a distant second, right 
up with that—to secure our planet’s fu-
ture. 
Climate change impacts every single 
one of us. It doesn’t care about our bor-
ders or national identities. It does 
present an opportunity for us to lead 
the world in saving this planet, lit-
erally, for our kids and grandkids. 
I am glad we have a President who 
understands this issue. The budget res-
olution we discussed with him today 
will pave the way for that to happen. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Madam President, more than 156,000 
Allied troops stormed the beaches of 
Normandy on D-day. Among them were 
2,000 African-American soldiers. Within 
that group was an even smaller band of 
brothers: 700 members of the 320th Bar-
rage Balloon Battalion, the only— 
only—all Black combat unit to take 
part in D-day. 
Ten days ago, on the Fourth of July, 
Henry Parham—the last known living 
member of that historic African-Amer-
ican battalion—died at a veteran’s hos-
pital in Pittsburgh. He was 99 years 
old. 
He was one in a million, literally. He 
was one of the 1 million African-Amer-
ican men and women who served in the

branches of the military that were still 
segregated for U.S. Armed Forces dur-
ing World War II. Many of these Black 
patriots believed they were fighting for 
a double victory, to beat fascism and to 
beat segregation and racism at home. 
Another 
African-American 
soldier 
who took part in the Normandy inva-
sion left high school at 17 to enlist in 
the Army. He served 2 years in France 
and Germany. 
When he returned to Mississippi, Jim 
Crow was waiting for him with ‘‘Whites 
only’’ water fountains, segregated pub-
lic schools, discriminatory poll taxes, 
and literary tests when you showed up 
to vote. So this veteran of the U.S. 
Army, this Black veteran of the U.S. 
Army who risked his life to fight for 
democracy, had to return to America 
and fight for it again. 
In 1954, he became the first Mis-
sissippi field secretary for the NAACP. 
One of his first assignments was the 
1955 killing of Emmett Till. He was 
asked to look into that for the NAACP. 
He organized boycotts of segregated 
businesses, 
and 
voter 
registration 
drives were established to help African 
Americans. For his efforts, he received 
countless death threats. His home was 
fire-bombed, and they tried to kill him 
more than once. 
On June 12, 1963, he arrived home 
after a midnight meeting, got out of 
his car, took a few steps, and was shot 
in the back by a White supremacist 
Klansman. The bullet pierced his heart 
and killed him. He was 37 years old. 
I remember the news reports on this. 
I was just a kid in college. The victim’s 
name was Medgar Evers. When he was 
murdered, he was carrying in his arms 
NAACP T-shirts that read ‘‘Jim Crow 
Must Go.’’ 
Sixty years later, I am afraid Jim 
Crow is still around. The invidious vot-
ing discrimination that Medgar Evers, 
John Lewis, Fannie Lou Hamer, and so 
many others sacrificed so much to end 
has not just returned in Mississippi, is 
not just returning to the South but 
across America. We are witnessing a 
coordinated, relentless, nationwide at-
tack on voting rights and on free and 
fair elections in America. 
Already this year, 17 States have en-
acted 28 new laws to make it harder for 
Americans—especially people of color— 
to vote. A total of nearly 400 bills 
eliminating the right to vote have been 
introduced in 48 States. These new 
voter suppression laws and proposed 
laws are the poisonous fruit of a dan-
gerous, discredited lie, the Big Lie, the 
same one that brought a murderous 
mob from a Trump rally to this Capitol 
on January 6. 
An angry, insecure man with a frag-
ile ego can’t bear the thought of losing. 
He can’t stand the notion of public re-
jection, so he summoned the mob to 
the Capitol on January 6 to try to over-
turn the Presidential election. They 
were on a mission for the President. As 
a result of their storming this Capitol, 
more than 140 Capitol Hill and other 
police officers were injured. One died 
defending this Capitol, defending us. 
The fact is, the 2020 election was free 
and fair, and Donald Trump lost. De-
spite all of his protests and lawsuits, 
there is no evidence other than that. 
A record number of Americans in 
that election braved a deadly pandemic 
to cast their votes. The Department of 
Homeland Security called the election 
‘‘the most secure in American his-
tory.’’ More than 80 judges, including 
many 
conservatives 
appointed 
by 
President Trump himself, threw out his 
claims in court that the election was 
stolen. 
When a voting machine company 
sued one of those lawyers for defama-
tion over false claims of switched and 
stolen votes, the defense her lawyer of-
fered was that ‘‘no reasonable person’’ 
would believe his client’s voter fraud 
lies. Yet Republican lawmakers in 
nearly every State are now using those 
same lies and the Big Lie to wage a 
sweeping assault on voting rights. 
These new voter suppression laws 
would make it harder for millions of 
Americans to cast their votes. Many 
who are eligible to cast their votes 
would lose the opportunity because of 
these new laws. Even more alarming, 
in many States, new laws would make 
it easier for partisan election officials 
to simply throw out election results 
they don’t like. 
Donald Trump used all the powers of 
his Presidency to try to force State 
election officials to overrule the will of 
their State’s voters and he failed. The 
rule of law won. Remember the record-
ing he had with the election official in 
Georgia? He did everything but threat-
en him with criminal action if he 
didn’t change the final official vote 
tally. Now some Republicans State leg-
islators want to change the laws to 
make voter nullification schemes legal. 
Never before in American history have 
we allowed anything like that. 
This is not democracy, and it must 
not be allowed to happen. This week, 51 
lawmakers from the State of Texas 
took the extraordinary step of leaving 
their State to deny the Texas House a 
quorum and prevent it from passing 
yet another State voter suppression 
law. The Texas law, among other 
things, would end the very practices 
that made it possible for historic num-
bers of Americans to vote safely and 
securely last November, things like 
drive-through voting, 24-hour polling 
places, ballot drop boxes. Each one of 
these changes would make it harder for 
poor people and minorities to vote, and 
that is what this is all about. 
In fleeing their State and traveling 
to Washington, the Texas lawmakers 
are sending an SOS for American de-
mocracy. They are sending a distress 
signal for voting rights. They are 
pleading with the Senate, our Senate, 
to act, to end the Republican filibuster 
of the For the People Act and update 
and pass the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Act now. Only Federal action and Fed-
eral protections can stop this assault 
on America’s voting rights. 
Madam President, there are solu-
tions. This onslaught of attacks on 
voting rights and election independ-
ence would not be possible without two 
rulings from the conservative majority 
of the Supreme Court that have gutted 
the Voting Rights Act. 
Earlier today, the Judiciary Commit-
tee’s Subcommittee on the Constitu-
tion held a hearing on what it takes to 
restore the Voting Rights Act after the 
misguided Shelby County decision and 
Brnovich decision this month. I want 
to thank Senator BLUMENTHAL
for 
chairing that important hearing. 
I want to commend President Biden 
for speaking out so forcefully about 
protecting voting rights in his speech 
yesterday in Philadelphia. Like Presi-
dent Kennedy nearly 60 years ago, 
President Biden reminded us that vot-
ing rights are not just a political issue; 
they are a moral issue. It is not just 
merely a legal concern; it is a concern 
that goes to our values as Americans. I 
also strongly support Attorney General 
Garland’s decision to double the size of 
the Justice Department’s Civil Rights 
Division after years of attrition. 
But the only way to truly end this 
unprecedented assault on voting is for 
Congress to step up. It is our responsi-
bility. The Big Lie that brought a 
deadly insurrection into this Chamber 
on January 6 has American democracy 
in its crosshairs. We have to act, and 
now is the time. 
The Senate must end the Republican 
filibuster of the For the People Act, 
stop voter suppression in States, get 
dark money out of politics, prevent bil-
lionaires from buying elections, and 
end partisan gerrymandering. We can-
not stand on ceremony and tradition 
while the pillars of our democracy are 
destroyed. If we lose free and fair elec-
tions, we lose our democracy. We must 
also introduce and pass the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act to re-
store and expand those rights and pre-
vent voter suppression. I am working 
with Senator LEAHY to that end. 
The right to vote is an American 
ideal. It shouldn’t be a partisan battle. 
John Lewis told us so often—‘‘The vote 
is precious,’’ he said. ‘‘It is almost sa-
cred. It is the most powerful non-
violent tool we have in a democratic 
society. And we have to use it.’’ 
I will close with this story. Every 
year, John Lewis led a group of Con-
gress Members and others on what he 
called a pilgrimage to some of the sa-
cred places of the American civil rights 
movement. I had the privilege of at-
tending one of those pilgrimages. 
In 2014, John Lewis led the pilgrim-
age to a different hallowed ground in 
American history. That year, the 50th 
anniversary of the Freedom Summer, 
John Lewis led groups to Money, MS, 
to the place where Emmett Till was 
murdered. Remember Emmett Till, the 
teenager from Chicago who was bru-
tally murdered in the South in Mis-
sissippi? They went to Philadelphia, 
MS, as well, where three young civil 
rights activists—names well known to 
my generation—James Chaney, Andrew 
Goodman, 
and 
Michael 
Schwerner,

were kidnapped and murdered during 
Freedom Summer because they were 
there to register Black voters. Then 
they traveled to Jackson, MS, to the 
house where Medgar Evers was cut 
down by an assassin’s bullet. 
Standing on the spot where Medgar 
Evers fell, John’s voice caught as he 
said: 
The night this man was shot and killed, 
something died in all of us in the [civil 
rights] movement. 
John Lewis led his pilgrimage to Mis-

so many to fulfill the promise of our 
Nation and secure voting rights. 
This Saturday will mark the 1-year 
anniversary of John Lewis’s passing. I 
miss him. He was a real friend. When 
he left us, something in all of us wept. 
We can keep the spirit of John Lewis 
alive by defending the greatest cause of 
his life, the cause for which he nearly 
died as a young man on that bridge in 
Selma: the right of every American to 
vote.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I complete my

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE BUDGET 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this 
is my fourth speech this year arguing 
how we are going to have to match our 
defense resources to our national de-
fense strategy. And this is a reminder— 
this is the National Defense Strategy. 
People seem to be forgetting about 
this. It was put together in 2018. Here 
are the names of the individuals. One 
was a former colleague; it was Jon Kyl. 
So we had 12, 6 Republicans and 6 
Democrats. Everyone agreed that this 
is what we need to do, not just for 2018 
but for each year afterwards. For this 
year, for example, they actually have 
in here that we should be increasing 
the defense budget by between 3 and 5 
percent. I show this because we all ad-
hered to these, Democrats and Repub-
licans, up until this year. 
This is the first time I have had a 
chance to talk about this budget in the 
Biden administration where we now 
have a lot of the details actually re-
leased in terms of the budget and what 
it does to our military. 
Remember, our expert, bipartisan 
NDS Commission Report said that we 
need 3 to 5 percent real growth in the 
defense budget each year to actually 
execute this strategy. The defense 
budget the Biden administration sent 
us does not achieve this goal. In fact, it 
is really a cut, in this administration. 
Even worse, just last week, the Fed 
predicted that inflation next year will 
be bigger than predicted. If that con-
tinues, this budget will mean even big-
ger cuts than expected and will ham-
string our troops even more than we 
thought. 
A lower defense top line than last 
year is just the first problem. The de-
tails of this budget are also worse than 
we forecasted. We have a flow chart 
here that shows that the budget puts 
shipbuilding on a starvation diet. The 
Navy tells us that we need 355 ships, 
probably more than the 400 that we 
have—that we are talking about right 
now. Right now, we are under 300 ships, 
and the trend is down, not up. What is 
the 
administration’s 
answer? 
They 
joke around about having a 355-ship 
Navy with only tugboats, but we don’t 
have the luxury of jokes. 
The people don’t know this out there. 
The people don’t realize that China is 
ahead of us and that Russia is ahead of 
us in some of these areas. They assume 
that we are always like it was right 
after World War II for so many years. 
The Chinese Navy already has 355 
ships. They already have them. That is 
not something they are looking for like 
we are right now. We are at 300 ships 
and looking for 355. They already have 
them. Then there are the Russians to 
add to that. That is another 223. So we 
are talking about far more that they 
have right now than we have, and no-
body understands that. It is as if we 
have only one opposition out there, one 
adversary. We don’t. We have several. 
The two prime adversaries are China 
and Russia, and they are up right now 
to 595 ships, and we are at 300. So what 
does that tell you? 
I am not the only one who is con-
cerned about this. A lot of people say: 
Well, the Republicans are the only ones 
who are concerned about our military. 
And that is not true. Democratic 
Congresswoman ELAINE LURIA said it 
well. She said: The Navy budget is not 
a serious budget for great power com-
petition. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
her recent article about the Navy’s 
fleet. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Texas National Security Review,

WAR ON THE ROCKS—LOOK TO THE 1980S TO 
INFORM THE FLEET OF TODAY 
(By Rep. Elaine Luria) 
When I was a naval officer, my ships al-
ways had a plan when we left port for where 
we were going, how we would get there, and 
what we would do when we arrived. While 
that remains true of individual ships in the 
Navy, it’s not true of the Navy as a whole 
today. The Navy lacks a comprehensive mar-
itime strategy that defines what the Navy 
needs to do, how it needs to do it, the re-
sources required, and how to manage risk if 
those resources aren’t available. The Navy 
had a strategy that did these things in the 
past. The maritime strategy of the 1980s ar-
ticulated a clear vision for the Navy’s pur-
pose and how Navy leaders planned to 
achieve it. The nation would be well-served 
by the Navy’s developing such a strategy 
again. 
I entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1993 
and was part of a new generation of officers 
who assumed the watch after the fall of the 
Soviet Union. We were the beneficiaries of a 
nation that had a clear and defensible mari-
time strategy, an administration that pro-
vided the vision, a Congress that funded it, 
and a Navy that executed it. Throughout my 
career, I deployed on both the Navy’s oldest 
and newest ships, but they were all designed 
for the Cold War against the Soviet Union. 
With China, the world has seen the mete-
oric rise of a maritime power that threatens 
U.S. and allied interests as well as free ac-
cess to the maritime common. The United 
States and like-minded nations are engaged 
in a new great-power competition. As the 
Navy focuses almost exclusively on future 
capabilities, it risks overlooking the imme-
diate threats posed by that competition 
today. A Battle Force 2045 plan does little to 
ensure a ready battle force in 2025. Today, no 
longer in uniform, but as the vice chair of 
the House Armed Services Committee, I be-
lieve the constitutional role of Congress ‘‘to 
provide and maintain a navy’’ should be 
based on something more than future hopes 
in technology and budget expectations. We 
need to be prepared now for any contin-
gencies that may occur on our collective 
watch. 
UNDERSTANDING THE 1980S MARITIME STRATEGY 
DURING GREAT-POWER COMPETITION 
In August 1982, Vice Chief of Naval Oper-
ations Adm. William Small ordered the de-
velopment of a document ‘‘to connect na-
tional strategy with defense programming.’’ 
Developed in just three weeks using briefing 
slides and speaking notes, this document 
birthed the Navy’s first global maritime 
strategy, which was designed to inform the 
Navy budgeting process. 
The authors developed the briefing using 
then-current war plans, contemporary direc-
tives on national defense policy, and intel-
ligence estimates of the Soviet threat, 
brought together with Secretary of the Navy 
John Lehman’s concept of a 600-ship navy. 
Over 18 months, the briefing evolved until it 
was finally signed by the chief of naval oper-
ations and issued as the Navy’s 1984 Mari-
time Strategy. As Lehman noted, ‘‘Once we 
had established the maritime strategy, we 
set about relating and conforming every-
thing else we did in the Navy and Marine 
Corps to it.’’ Because of the global reach and 
strength of the strategy, the Navy’s stated 
need for a 600-ship fleet was defensible, and 
clearly tied to the numbers and types of 
ships needed to win in conflict. With the full 
support of the president, this strategy 
launched the nation on a trajectory to a 
massive Navy build-up, which nearly realized 
this fleet before the conclusion of the Cold 
War. The strategy clearly showed why the 
Navy needed 600 ships and indicated exactly 
where they would be deployed in global war-
time operations. Additionally—and often 
overlooked when discussing the strategy— 
the strategy articulated the requirement for 
a peacetime presence to fill deterrent roles, 
reduce response times, and provide policy-
makers with naval crisis-response options. 
One-third of the ships needed for wartime 
missions in each theater would always be 
forward deployed under the strategy. Ensu-
ing force-structure assessments have lacked 
this clear strategic vision for the role of 
naval forces. 
BACK TO THE FUTURE 
Lehman recently noted, ‘‘In some previous 
and current periods, naval strategy (if you 
could call it that) has been derived from pre-
dicted budgets. During the 1980s, the process 
was reversed: first strategy, then require-
ments, then the [Program Objective Memo-
randum], then budget.’’ The difference be-
tween strategy preceding budget or budget 
preceding strategy is the difference between 
going to the store with a shopping list to 
make a specific meal, and going to the store, 
looking in your wallet, and asking, ‘‘What 
could I buy with that?’’ According to Leh-
man, a good strategy is a living document

that must be tested, refined, and tested 
again. Most importantly, however, the strat-
egy should be simple, logical, achievable and 
focus on the enemy’s vulnerabilities above 
all else. 
The Navy’s most recent strategy docu-
ment, the tri-service maritime strategy 
issued in December 2020 known as Advantage 
at Sea, correctly acknowledges the maritime 
nature of the United States as a nation 
whose security and prosperity depends on 
the seas, and highlights the great-power 
competition faced today. It acknowledges 
the current world environment and gives 
guiding principles for prevailing in long- 
term strategic competition. But this docu-
ment is not a strategy. It is a vision. One 
cannot design a fleet to meet current chal-
lenges, develop a naval force structure for 
the future, or create a budget input solely 
from a vision—these require a global mari-
time strategy to fight and win against a peer 
competitor, while simultaneously deterring 
other malign actors. 
U.S. maritime leaders need to answer the 
question: How would the U.S. Navy deter or 
defeat Chinese naval aggression, which may 
perhaps be compounded and complicated by 
other states such as Russia, Iran, or North 
Korea acting opportunistically while U.S. 
Navy forces are engaged elsewhere? How can 
the U.S. Navy make a strategic difference? 
Irv Blickstein served in the senior executive 
service in the Navy’s programming office in 
the 1980s. In a recent interview, he said, ‘‘If 
you look at the vision the Navy has today, 
nobody quite understands what they want to 
do . . . the Congress is not convinced, and 
they would like to better understand what 
the Navy’s plan is.’’ As Lehman noted, ‘‘A 
critical lesson from the Maritime Strategy is 
that the Navy must restore credibility with 
Congress and the public that it knows what 
kinds of ships, aircraft, and technologies are 
needed.’’ What is missing is a concept of op-
erations, broadly stated. 
Today’s national security climate is dif-
ferent than that of the 1980s when the United 
States and Soviet Union faced off at the Cold 
War’s apex. The Navy does not have the dec-
ades-long at-sea experience with China that 
it did with the Soviet Union after the World 
War II. Today, the Navy has fewer than half 
the ships that it had in the 1980s. While mod-
ern U.S. Navy forces are more capable than 
those of the 1980s, the same is true of Amer-
ica’s competitors’ forces, especially China’s. 
In the 1980s, the F–14 program was less than 
a decade old, as new programs like the F–18, 
Aegis, Vertical Launch System, and Nimitz- 
class carriers matured. These were state of 
the art platforms and systems developed to 
counter specific Soviet threats and tactics. 
By comparison, the platforms the Navy has 
today are either (like the littoral combat 
ship) designed for a low-threat, post-Cold 
War environment, or designed to counter the 
same Soviet threats and tactics, as the 
Zumwalt-class destroyers are. Meanwhile, 
the Chinese have designed platforms and 
weapons, such as the DF–26 ‘‘carrier killer’’ 
missiles, to counter the heart of the U.S. 
fleet. 
Not only does the Navy have a problem 
with lagging technology, the Navy also has a 
numbers problem. China is outbuilding the 
U.S. Navy at a rate the United States has 
been unwilling as a nation to match. Three- 
quarters of U.S. surface combatants are 
more than a decade old, while three-quarters 
of Chinese naval vessels are less than a dec-
ade old. 
In addition to growing in size, China’s 
naval forces have grown their sea legs. Since 
2009, more than three dozen Chinese anti-pi-
racy flotillas have deployed to the Indian 
Ocean and elsewhere. These flotillas from 
the North, East, and South Sea Fleets have 
gained nearly as much experience as have 
U.S. Navy deployed strike groups over the 
same period. 
THE LOST GENERATION 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy has lost a gen-
eration of shipbuilding to failed programs. 
For example, the DD–21 program office 
(which resulted in the Zumwalt-class de-
stroyer) was established in 1998. Originally 
scheduled for a 32-ship production line, but 
pared down to just three, the Zumwalt and 
her two sister ships have not deployed. One 
of the game-changing weapons those ships 
were to use, the electromagnetic railgun— 
which had been under development since 
2005—was abandoned in the Navy’s current 
budget. Similarly, the CVN–21 program exec-
utive office, which was set up to produce 
what became the Gerald Ford-class aircraft 
carrier, was established in 1996. The USS 
Ford has not yet deployed. 
To put this in perspective, I graduated 
from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1997—be-
tween the years in which these programs 
were established. I retired four years ago 
after a full naval career and have since twice 
been elected to Congress. Yet in all of that 
time, neither ship class has deployed. Amer-
ica cannot afford for it to take multiple dec-
ades to design, build, and deploy the next 
generation of warships. 
Even new shipbuilding programs that have 
resulted in deployed ships have been trou-
bled. Multiple challenges with the Littoral 
Combat Ship program have resulted in some 
of those ships being slated for decommis-
sioning only a few years into their intended 
lifespan. The Constellation-class frigates, in-
tended to provide a more capable alternative 
to the lightly armed littoral combat ship, 
will not be present in the fleet in significant 
numbers for a decade or more. 
In its Fiscal Year 2022 budget request the 
Navy 
proposes 
decommissioning 
almost 
twice the number of ships it plans to build 
this year. Among the ships the Navy wants 
to retire are seven cruisers, some of which 
were only recently modernized at a cost of 
hundreds of millions of dollars. The Navy has 
argued that the maintenance costs on these 
decades-old ships would be better spent on 
new, modern programs and capabilities. This 
is one example of the broader ‘‘divest to in-
vest’’ strategy reflected in this year’s budg-
et, which does not instill confidence in the 
likelihood of fielding a capable fleet in a 
timely manner. Just as the planned railgun 
in the Zumwalt class did not come to fru-
ition, history shows that reliance on hopes 
and dreams for ‘‘game-changers’’ is a poor 
substitute for forces and strategy. 
With flat or reduced budgets, the Navy has 
no good options. It can sacrifice readiness, 
sacrifice research and development, or sac-
rifice fleet size. Those are the Navy’s only 
options—and they are all bad. I empathize 
with the position that Navy leadership finds 
themselves in today, as they have inherited 
a scenario created by decades of their prede-
cessors’ failed shipbuilding efforts—a sce-
nario that has no real solution without the 
commitment of significant additional re-
sources. Regardless of administration, the 
United States has been unwilling as a nation 
to prioritize shipbuilding, much to its even-
tual detriment with regard to Chinese ag-
gression and control of the maritime com-
mons. China isn’t waiting until 2045 to real-
ize its fleet. Neither should the United 
States. America needs a ready Navy that can 
credibly deter a potential conflict with a 
confident and overwhelming opponent.’ 
A NEW MARITIME STRATEGY 
For the past three years—in numerous 
hearings and through information requests— 
I have sought to determine the Navy’s cur-
rent global maritime strategy. What I have 
discovered is that it does not exist. There is 
not a clear plan similar to the 1984 Maritime 
Strategy that can inform and clearly articu-
late the fleet needed today to deter Chinese 
aggression, fight and win a war with China if 
required, and also employ naval forces glob-
ally in response to other malign actors such 
as Russia, Iran, and North Korea. I have 
heard many buzzwords, acronyms, and plati-
tudes, but as naval strategist Sir Julian 
Corbett said, ‘‘Nothing is so dangerous in the 
study of war as to permit maxims to become 
a substitute for judgement.’’ 
Former Acting Secretary of the Navy 
Thomas Madly confirmed as much to me 
when we spoke recently. According to him, 
We’ve had oscillating and unrealistic ship-
building goals, and a variety of operational 
warfighting plans designed for fairly static 
contingencies. Neither of these have been the 
byproducts of a coherent national maritime 
strategy that addresses our biggest threats, 
the broader geographies we must protect, or 
the unpredictable nature of the future. The 
national maritime strategy we need today 
must be an agile one that allows for rapid de-
velopment and adaptation. The force struc-
ture it defines should also have the same 
characteristics. The strategy must be devel-
oped with a sober look at our adversaries and 
global responsibilities. Further, it must be 
implemented with a national consensus be-
cause such implementation, without a doubt, 
will be costly to the taxpayers. 
The United States needs a Navy capable of 
maintaining maritime superiority and pre-
serving free trade and freedom of the seas for 
America and its allies and partners. The 
Navy immediately should develop a bold 
global maritime strategy, which will clearly 
define the fleet required today. This global 
strategy 
should 
focus 
on 
Chinese 
vulnerabilities, of which there are many, in-
cluding dependence on access to shipping 
lanes to fuel their economy. The U.S. Navy 
should be ready to target critical mainland 
infrastructure 
and 
close 
maritime 
chokepoints to strangle the Chinese econ-
omy. American forces should be agile and 
unpredictable, using geography to their ad-
vantage with mobile capabilities. This type 
of strategy will require a larger Navy in con-
cert with the other services. Day to day, the 
U.S. Navy should be present in the East and 
South China Seas, exercising with allied na-
vies, testing the strategy, and refining it. 
From this new maritime strategy will flow 
an informed force structure that will com-
pellingly spell out to lawmakers and the 
American public the essential and urgent 
need to invest in a larger Navy to deter Chi-
nese aggression and hold at bay other malign 
actors who may seek to take advantage of 
any future conflict in the Pacific. As Leh-
man notes in discussing the development of 
the 1984 Maritime Strategy, 90 percent of the 
deterrent power of this buildup could be 
achieved in the first year. This was done by 
publicly declaring and explaining the strat-
egy, especially its naval component, and tak-
ing actions that left no doubt among friend 
and foe that it would be achieved. Those ac-
tions included [the need] to submit a revised 
Defense budget to Congress that fully funded 
the buildup. 
Today, U.S. Navy leadership should heed 
the words of Lehman: ‘‘First strategy, then 
requirements, then the POM, then budget.’’ 
The global situation and America’s competi-
tors and adversaries may have evolved, but 
the process by which the U.S. Navy designs 
and builds the fleet should take a valuable 
lesson from the 1980s. If the United States is 
to remain a global power, it needs a Navy fit 
for the purpose and the United States, as a 
nation, needs to make the commitment to 
prioritize national defense and make this in-
vestment.

July 14, 2021 
Mr. INHOFE. This budget also fails 
to make any progress in a growing or 
modernizing Air Force. Instead, the 
Biden budget procurement actually de-
creases by almost 15 percent across the 
entire military. The Air Force is 20 
percent. President Biden’s own nomi-
nee for the Secretary of the Air Force 
told us that one of the best things that 
we could do is to accelerate the buying 
of additional F–35s, but this budget 
doesn’t do that. The fleet just gets 
older and smaller. 
Perhaps the greatest casualty of the 
Biden budget is the Army. I guess I am 
used to that by now. I was a product of 
the Army, and all my Army friends re-
member what happened back in 1994. I 
was in the House at that time and on 
the House Armed Services Committee. 
At that time, I can remember when 
someone who was in a hearing—an ex-
pert—predicted that, in 10 years, we 
would no longer need ground troops. Of 
course, we know what has happened 
since that time. The greatest casualty 
is always the Army. Instead of invest-
ing, it deeply cuts the Army across the 
board in its modernization, procure-
ment, force structure, and readiness. 
I can’t understand why we decreased 
full spectrum training just as we have 
started to get healthy after the readi-
ness crisis of 2017, and we all remember 
what happened in 2017. That was the 
last 5 years of the Obama administra-
tion, and they were the years that cut 
our military substantially. They actu-
ally did reduce our budget in the last 5 
years by 25 percent, the military budg-
et. At the same time, China was in-
creasing theirs by 78 percent. This is 
the problem that we had back then, 
and it is still going on. 
Don’t take my word for it. General 
McConville told us last week that most 
of the Army’s weapons systems are 
1980s vintage. Yet the Biden adminis-
tration is slow-walking the Army’s 
modernization efforts while our adver-
saries are relentlessly advancing—and 
they are. Secretary Wormuth, who is 
the Secretary of the Army, said the 
service is still under stress in some 
areas, including defense, which is a 
critical priority, and that is unaccept-
able. 
Additionally, while Secretary Austin 
kept his promise to fully fund nuclear 
modernization, this is an area I can’t 
blame anybody for because this has 
been going on for a long period of time, 
since after World War II, that being 
that our nuclear modernization pro-
gram has not been substantial. Others 
have been catching up with us slowly 
but surely, and that is where we are 
today. So he kept his word. His prom-
ise was to fully fund nuclear mod-
ernization. 
I remain concerned about the $600 
million cut in the NNSA’s deferred 
maintenance budget. Now, with the 
NNSA, we are talking about nuclear 
now, our nuclear capabilities. It would 
have fixed crumbling infrastructure 
that is necessary to keep the nuclear 
weapons program on track. 
Now, you can’t see this very well, but 
when you look closely, it is worth com-
ing up to look. We see some of the old-
est equipment here, and it is obvious 
just by looking at it that it doesn’t 
work. So not only are other countries 
catching up and passing us, but our 
equipment has not been modernized. 
That is what we were going to do, and 
this is what Secretary Austin wants to 
do, but we have not been able to pay 
for it yet. We have to get that done. It 
would have fixed crumbling infrastruc-
ture that is necessary to keep nuclear 
weapons on track. 
The reality of this budget cut is on 
display in the unfunded priorities list 
that was put together by military serv-
ices and the combatant commanders. 
No one knows more than the combat-
ant commanders about our state of 
readiness. In total, we are looking at 
$25 billion in key equipment weapons— 
and more that our services could use— 
but this budget can’t support it. 
Many people call these wish lists. I 
call them risk lists. The reason we 
don’t hear a lot about people who are 
talking about the risks, the military 
people, is that ‘‘risk’’ means lives. 
When military people talk about risk, 
they talk about losing lives. People 
don’t like to talk about that, but we 
are now in the position whereby we 
have to talk about it. We can only kick 
the can down the road so far, gener-
ating more and more risk. We don’t 
talk about risk. We never do. We just 
demand that our military do more with 
less. We keep divesting, but the invest-
ments never follow. This trend of in-
creased risk has only accelerated. It is 
already clear that the administration 
is signaling they want to cut the mili-
tary even deeper next year. 
Earlier this month, I read in the 
press about a memo by the Acting Sec-
retary of the Navy as he tried to mini-
mize the damage and risk of his sailors 
resulting from the significant budget 
cuts. He was very sincere about this. 
He said the Navy is forced to choose be-
tween modernizing ships, subs, and air-
craft. Does anyone in here believe that 
the 
Chinese 
are 
choosing 
between 
ships, subs, and aircraft? 
Recently, our Nation’s highest rank-
ing military officer, General Milley, 
told us that the Chinese and Russians 
combined actually spend more than we 
on defense. Now, think about that for a 
minute. You don’t hear that. Nobody is 
talking about this. We have been told 
for so many years that we don’t need to 
spend more on defense because we al-
ready spend more than our competi-
tors. It turns out that this is just not 
true, and the American people are not 
aware of this. 
Now, part of the difference is that 
the Chinese and the Russians don’t 
take care of their people. I have talked 
a lot about the fact that we don’t do 
that. Do you remember all of the hous-
ing problems that we were all con-
cerned about? Are we spending enough 
on housing for our people? Communist 
countries don’t care about that. They 
just give them the guns and say: Go 
out and kill people. They don’t care 
about people. The greatest expense 
that we have in supporting the mili-
tary is the expense that we have for 
housing and for the quality of life of 
our troops. 
By the way, I am drawing out a cou-
ple of Democrats when I talk about the 
problem and the fact that this is a con-
cern. It is not just a concern of the Re-
publicans. These are Democratic Mem-
bers, and they are concerned. Demo-
cratic Congressman ANTHONY
BROWN 
made this point recently, and I agree 
with him. 
He wrote: 
We spend $1 billion more on Medicare in 
the defense budget than we do on new tac-
tical vehicles. We spend more on the Defense 
Health Program than we do on new ships. 
Now, that came from a Democratic 
Member of the House. 
He concluded: 
In total, some $200 billion in the defense 
budget are essentially for nondefense pur-
poses—from salaries to health care to basic 
research. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
Congressman BROWN’s article because I 
think it gets it exactly right, and this 
is coming from the other side. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Defense News, May 14, 2021] 
THE CASE FOR A ROBUST DEFENSE BUDGET 
(By Rep. Anthony Brown) 
The United States is confronting a mul-
titude of complex domestic and global chal-
lenges brought about by the COVID–19 pan-
demic 
(https://www.defensenews.com/ 
coronavirus/), disruptive technologies, severe 
weather 
events 
(https:// 
www.defensenews.com/smr/energy- 
andenvironment/), 
systemic 
racism, 
and 
great power competition with China and 
Russia. Now more than ever, Congress has a 
responsibility to ensure that we robustly 
fund our national security, even as the cost 
of doing so rises every year. 
We maintain our national security not 
only by the military dollars we spend, but 
also by the resources we dedicate to inter-
national diplomacy and development, and 
the investments we make at home in infra-
structure and education, in climate change 
mitigation, and in health care, public safety 
and our democratic institutions. 
With ample defense and nondefense spend-
ing, we are better able to secure our nation, 
revitalize our economy, defeat the pandemic 
and restore U.S. global leadership. 
The American Jobs Plan and the American 
Families Plan are bold initiatives that will 
strengthen our nation. They comprise long- 
overdue investments in infrastructure, inno-
vation and our workforce, and they meet the 
equitable needs of our children and families. 
They promote American competitiveness 
and security. Yet, we should not irrespon-
sibly cut defense spending as a way to offset 
the costs of these necessary investments. We 
cannot ‘‘rob Peter to pay Paul.’’ 
We need a well-funded military because we 
ask the men and women in our armed forces 
to do more today than ever before. 
Our military deters aggression from China 
and Russia. China seeks to exert more con-
trol 
over 
trade 
and 
resources

Our armed forces defend the homeland 
against threats from North Korea, which has 
tested missiles (https://missilethreat.csis.org/

ital, and Iran, which funds terrorism in the 
Middle East and attacks our institutions 
through 
cyber 
operations 
(https:// 
www.csis.org/programs/technology-policy- 
program/publicly-reported-iranian-cyber-ac-
tions–2019). And through it all, our military 
maintains watch against terrorism. 
The threats are real and increasing, and we 
must rise to meet these challenges—not sim-
ply because we have an interest in our own 
security and the international order, but be-
cause the United States has a greater inter-
est than any other nation. 
While we are less than 5 percent of the 
world’s population, we generate 20 percent 
(https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/economy-trade) 
of global economic production. We are the 
leader in international trade, with over $5 
trillion in commerce crossing our borders 
annually, including smartphones, cars and 
the medicines that we need. 
Securing the global economy on which we 
rely demands that we field an expeditionary 
force capable of deploying to where it is 
needed most. Whether securing the 60 per-
cent (https://chinapower.csis.org/much-trade- 
transits-south-china-sea/) of maritime trade 
transiting 
the 
Indo-Pacific 
region, 
or

smr/frozenpathways/2021/04/12/russian-mili-
tary-buildup-in-the-arctic-has-northern- 
nato-members-uneasy/) for newly accessible 
resources, our military must be able to oper-
ate anywhere and everywhere around the 
world. 
Success in these varied regions and mis-
sions requires us to train and equip our 
forces to prevail over any adversary, both in 
competition and in conflict. It means invest-
ing in fighter jets that can counter Russian 
advanced aircraft and developing submarines 
to avoid detection by Chinese sensors; mod-
ernizing our Army so soldiers have 21st cen-
tury technology to fight and survive; and en-
suring sufficient troop levels to limit back- 
to-back deployments so our military has 
time at home with family to maintain mo-
rale 
and 
readiness 
(https:// 
www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2020/o2/14/ 
why—we—should—grow—the—active— 
duty—army—115042.html). Having a global 
force that is ready and lethal provides the 
necessary presence to deter war and main-
tain peace in the global commons. 
At the center of this worldwide mission are 
the men and women who serve. 
Two million service members and civilians 
devote their lives to our defense, and the 
Pentagon’s budget funds the everyday needs 
for them and their families: health care to 10 
million Americans (https://health.mil/News/ 
Gallery/Infographics/2017/05/01/MHS-Facts- 
and-Figures), child care for 200,000 children 
(https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/ 
R/R45288/7), retirement for 1.5 million vet-
erans (https://media.defense.gov/2019/May/14/ 
2002131753/-1/-1/o/MRS—STATRPT— 
2018%20V5.PDF#page=7) and K–12 education 
in about 160 schools (https://www.dodea.edu/ 
aboutdodea/demographics.cfm) worldwide. 
The benefits of defense spending reach be-
yond the military and our contribution to 
the international order, returning the in-
vestment through domestic dividends. Dur-
ing Hurricane Katrina, the National Guard 
rescued over 17,000 people and airlifted al-
most 
22 
million 
pounds 
(https:// 
www.nationalguard.mil/Features/2015/Re-
membering-Hurricane-Katrina/) of cargo to 
the flooded areas. The Pentagon’s $8 billion 
annual spend on research invigorates our 
academic and tech sectors, resulting in tech-
nologies like GPS and Google Maps, which 
were first invented by Navy scientists. De-
fense innovations like radar are now in civil-
ian use, and they power the weather stations 
that detect increasingly severe storms amid 
climate change. And the internet, the back-
bone of the global economy, began as a De-
fense Department program. 
We spend $1 billion more on Medicare in 
the defense budget than we do on new tac-
tical vehicles. We spend more on the Defense 
Health Program than we do on new ships. In 
total, some $200 billion in the defense budget 
are essentially for nondefense purposes— 
from salaries to health care to basic re-
search. 
In no place are these domestic benefits of 
defense spending clearer than in the current 
pandemic. The Moderna vaccine, developed 
in record time, was originally seeded by a 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
investment in 2013, and a subsequent Pen-
tagon request to rapidly produce a human 
ready antibody contributed to the delivery of 
multiple vaccines in under a year. And 50,000 
National 
Guard 
members 
are 
assisting 
(https:/ 
/www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/covid-vac-
cination-crisis-national-guard-is-being-mobi-
lized.html) in coronavirus testing and vac-
cinations across the country, strengthening 
our nation against a grave threat to our col-
lective health. 
We should neither view the nondefense and 
defense budgets as opposite sides of the same 
coin, nor accept them as a false choice be-
tween two competing options. 
This nation was founded to form a more 
perfect Union, and in doing so to provide for 
the common defense and promote the gen-
eral welfare. For 233 years, Congress has en-
deavored to balance these responsibilities, 
and in doing so has often found a way to se-
cure our democracy and freedoms while at 
the same time investing in America as the 
land of opportunity. It is imperative that we 
in Congress meet these challenges and fulfill 
our responsibilities. 
Our national security depends on it. 
Mr. INHOFE. We can disagree some-
times about how we compete with 
China on nondefense areas. It is impor-
tant. That is an important debate. We 
want to do that, but we have to be on 
the same page when it comes to na-
tional security. 
Some people would say that my criti-
cism of cutting the military is because 
President Biden is a Democrat. I want 
to be really clear that this is not about 
politics; it is about protecting this Na-
tion and making sure our men and 
women in uniform have the training 
and the resources and the equipment 
they need to compete and complete 
their missions and come home safely. I 
mean, this is what we are supposed to 
be doing, and that is what we are 
doing. 
I told President Trump, back when 
he sent his initial budget up when he 
became President of the United States, 
that it was not adequate at that time. 
I called up Secretary Mattis, and we 
met the President at the White House. 
We showed him why it was inadequate, 
and it was inadequate. So we were able 
to get something done at that time, 
and that is something that we are con-
cerned about today. 
I happen to think President Trump 
wanted to spend even more on his 
troops, but I think he got some bad ad-
vice from his advisers. I think the same 
is true with President Biden. I think he 
wants a strong military when he is up 
against our adversaries. I know this 
President believes that a strong mili-
tary underpins all of our other tools 
and national power, including diplo-
matic efforts. I know the President be-
lieves in America’s role in the world 
and in the value of deterrence. I know 
the President believes in the impor-
tance of our allies and the partners 
who look to us for commitments and 
for investments to know that we are 
very serious. Our President knows 
that. President Biden knows this, but 
we don’t have the budget to support it. 
The President needs to be coming 
forth with adequate budgets to take 
care of the problems that we are faced 
with today. We all know how painful 
Obama’s readiness crisis was as flight 
training hours were slashed, and we 
didn’t know all of the things that hap-
pened during the last 5 years of his ad-
ministration. 
This 
administration 
should remember how dangerous that 
was not just for our deterrence but also 
because there was a human cost. That 
is one of many reasons I am struggling 
to 
understand 
the 
administration’s 
cuts to the defense budget. 
One thing we have been told is that 
anything more than this defense budg-
et is just not affordable. We have been 
told by the Pentagon that we have to 
live more fiscally. That is one way to 
tell the military that you don’t care 
about them. This administration wants 
to spend trillions in taxpayers’ dollars 
on everything you can think of except 
on 
the 
military, 
and 
this 
comes 
through very clearly when the amount 
of increase they are having right now 
is between 16 and 20 percent and ours is 
1.6 percent. 
In reality, the investments we need 
to strengthen our military in the dec-
ades to come are minimal when com-
pared to overall Federal budgeting. De-
fense spending compared to our GDP is 
half of what it was in the Cold War, 
and we live in a much more dangerous 
world now. We have been told that the 
Pentagon must make hard choices as if 
hard choices are a substitute for strat-
egy-based budgeting. Yet we are not 
making hard choices; we are just mak-
ing bad choices. 
All of our current military and senior 
DOD officials agree that we have a

good military strategy for China and 
Russia, but the budget doesn’t support 
that strategy. As a result, I am worried 
that deterrence will fail maybe today 
or maybe 5 years from now, and when 
it does, the cost will be much higher 
than any investment we would make 
today. 
We have made a sacred compact with 
our servicemembers. We tell them that 
we will take care of them and take care 
of their families. We do that very well, 
but we also tell them that we will give 
them the tools to defend the Nation 
and to come home safely, but we are 
not holding up that end of the bargain. 
With this proposed budget and the 
prospects of further cuts, we are failing 
to give them the resources they need. 
We can’t simply spend our way out of 
our military problems, but we can 
spend too little to give ourselves a 
chance. We have seen the high cost of 
underinvesting in the military. Under-
funding in the military tempts our ad-
versaries, raises doubts in our allies, 
and makes war more, not less, likely. 
So we need to make a generational 
investment in our defenses so that our 
children and grandchildren don’t have 
to, and we are not doing that now. 
We have a lot of impatient people 
right now who want to vote. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4895 
July 14, 2021 
have been subject to sexual assault or 
other serious crimes get the justice 
they deserve. 
I know that my colleague from Okla-
homa, the ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services, reached out 
to 
our 
military 
chiefs 
for 
their 
thoughts on this bill. While there was, 
as Army GEN James McConville wrote, 
recognition ‘‘that there are concerns 
with the way our current process pur-
sues justice for major crimes,’’ I under-
stand that they also have concerns 
about this legislation, and I would like 
to allay those concerns today. 
More broadly, the service chiefs’ let-
ters all seem to indicate a misunder-
standing of how fundamental this 
change would be. Marine Corps Gen. 
David Berger, for instance, wrote that 
the bill ‘‘appears to create a more com-
plex system that could potentially slow 
the military justice process.’’ Space 
Force Gen. John Raymond wrote that 
‘‘the proposed changes add a layer of 
complexity that needs to be fully un-
derstood.’’ 
This bill would streamline, not com-
plicate, the military justice process. 
The lawyers who would be making 
these prosecution decisions under our 
legislation are already working on 
these very cases. 
Navy ADM Michael Gilday expressed 
concern that ‘‘large scale removal of 
commanders’ authority could cause 
sailors to doubt the capabilities of 
their commanders or to believe that 
their commanders operate without the 
full trust of their superiors.’’ 
That worry is unfounded. Iraq and 
Afghanistan Veterans of America sur-
veyed 
their 
members—recent 
vet-
erans—and 77 percent said that moving 
a serious crime like sexual assault out 
of the chain of command would have no 
impact on their view of the com-
mander’s authority. Nearly 1 in 10 said 
that the change would lead them to 
view their commander as more of an 
authority figure. 
I would point out that the IRC Chair-
woman, Lynn Rosenthal, said: 
The IRC rejects the motion that, by mov-
ing legal decisions about prosecution from 
the command structure, that commanders 
would have no role. It’s simply not the case. 
Commanders are responsible for the climates 
they create. They’re responsible for working 
to prevent sexual assault and sexual harass-
ment, and they’re responsible for making 
sure that victims are protected when they 
come forward to report. So, the idea that 
they won’t have an interest in solving this 
problem if they are not making those tech-
nical legal decisions, we think, is simply 
false. 
I trust that our commanders will be 
able to maintain their authority and 
maintain their investment in the wel-
fare of the troops without being re-
sponsible for deciding these serious 
crimes. 
General Berger put it well. He wrote: 
I expect commanders to always bear re-
sponsibility for their Marines; changes like 
those in this bill will never relieve com-
manders of their duty to care for and lead 
their Marines, including when certain mili-
tary justice processes are removed from 
their control. 
There were also questions about 
whether or not these changes were 
needed for all serious crimes. Admiral 
Gilday wrote that he had ‘‘seen no evi-
dence that there is a lack of trust 
among victims for all crimes for which 
the punishment exceeds one year of 
confinement.’’ 
There is evidence. The Department of 
the Air Force inspector general con-
ducted a survey in 2020 which found 
that one in three Black servicemem-
bers said they believe the military dis-
cipline system is biased against them 
and that three in five Black service-
members believe they do not and will 
not receive the same benefit of the 
doubt as their White peers if they get 
in trouble. That level of distrust must 
be addressed. 
General Raymond also suggested a 
more limited reform, writing that be-
yond sexual assault, ‘‘the other of-
fenses are not as complex and do not 
require specialized training.’’ On the 
contrary. Crimes included in our bill, 
like murder, manslaughter, fraud, and 
extortion, all present complex cases, 
and they deserve to be put in the pur-
view of trained legal experts. 
As you know, Mr. President, our bill 
has a bright line at felonies. To be a 
felony, it has to be a complex crime. 
Our 
bill 
does 
not 
include 
mis-
demeanors. 
The service chiefs’ letters also in-
cluded calls to put an emphasis on pre-
venting, rather than prosecuting, these 
crimes. I, too, would rather see these 
crimes not happen, which is why this 
bill includes various provisions on pre-
vention efforts. But given the current 
reality, prevention is not enough. We 
must prosecute these serious crimes 
and show that there are real con-
sequences for anyone who commits 
them. Doing so not only changes the 
culture, it will remove recidivists from 
the ranks, preventing them from com-
mitting more crimes. 
Right now, there is a deep lack of 
trust in the current system and wheth-
er or not it can or will deliver justice. 
That is detrimental to our armed serv-
ices. 
As 
General 
Raymond 
wrote, 
‘‘Lack of trust and reluctance to seek 
justice are, in themselves, readiness 
issues.’’ 
I remind my colleagues that our job 
is to provide oversight and account-
ability over the executive branch, in-
cluding the armed services, and to en-
sure that those who serve our country 
in uniform are being well served by 
their government. 
As Berger noted, if the Uniform Code 
of Military Justice does not adequately 
‘‘promote justice’’ or ‘‘assist in main-
taining good order and discipline,’’ 
then it must change. The current sys-
tem does not adequately promote jus-
tice, and it must change. It is our duty 
and our obligation to do the work to 
change it, and this body and every Sen-
ator in it deserves to have a vote. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 1520 and the Senate 
proceed to its consideration; that there 
be 2 hours for debate equally divided in 
the usual form; and that upon the use 
or yielding back of that time, the Sen-
ate vote on the bill with no intervening 
action or debate.

VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this is 
a critical time for America. It is a mo-
ment in which the actions we take or 
don’t take will affect the very design of 
our government for generations to 
come. 
Our Founders had a vision that we all 
are created equal. In our initial Con-
stitution, it wasn’t fully manifested, 
but we have worked through several 
hundred years to come to that point 
that we recognize that every American 
should be able to participate in the di-
rection of their country. We had some 
key moments in that national debate. 
I was always fascinated that when 
my father was born in 1919, women 
couldn’t vote in America. We had all 
kinds of other barriers for communities 
of color—for Black Americans, for Na-
tive Americans—and those barriers we 
struck down time after time after 
time. 
Then we came to 1965, and we said 
there are still so many ways that com-
munities are trying to keep every cit-
izen from participating in voting, and 
we are going to make sure that ends 
from this point forward. 
President Johnson said that the 
power of the vote is the most signifi-
cant tool ever developed to strike down 
injustice. It is a powerful tool. It is 
really the beating heart of our Repub-
lic, that ballot box, the ability to say: 
This is what I like, and this is what I 
don’t like. This is who I like, and this 
is who I don’t think will carry the poli-
cies I believe in. 
At its heart, this is a vision of power 
flowing up from the people, not down 
from the powerful, but here is the prob-
lem: The powerful don’t like that vi-
sion of America, so they have many, 
many strategies designed to try to 
override that founding vision of par-
ticipation. They have legions of law-
yers, and they have legions of lobby-
ists. There are three drug lobbyists for 
every single Member of Congress. They

July 14, 2021 
have the ability to fund mass media 
campaigns to try to change the way 
that issues are framed. They have the 
ability to participate with dark money 
in elections that manifests itself in 
those endless attack ads you see on so-
cial media and on television. 
They have all of these abilities, but 
the thing they really fear is the ballot 
box, and right now in America, they 
are going after the ballot box. We have 
to decide if we are going to defend it or 
not. That is the challenge that faces 
us, and it is a challenge that shouldn’t 
be that difficult because every single 
one of us in this Chamber took an oath 
to the Constitution. The Constitution 
lays out the power, the vision of gov-
ernment of, by, and for the people. It 
starts off in the Constitution ‘‘we the 
people,’’ not ‘‘we the powerful’’—‘‘we 
the people.’’ 
This assault has now spread to 18 
States and 35 new, restrictive voting 
laws. These laws attack the ability to 
vote, and they are targeting Black 
Americans, communities of color, poor 
Americans, and college students. They 
make it harder to register. They make 
it easier to purge voters off the voting 
rolls. You can’t vote if you are not on 
a voting roll. They attack early voting. 
They attack vote by mail. They attack 
curbside voting. They make it hard to 
drop off your ballot. They make it hard 
for people with disabilities to fill out 
their ballots. 
In some cases, they are creating a 
strategy of voter intimidation by al-
lowing poll watchers to essentially 
hover over you as you vote and chal-
lenge your legitimacy to vote. They 
have even decided, in some cases, to 
make it so that, if you are in line to 
vote and it is a hot day, nobody can 
give you a drink of water. All of these 
strategies are about biasing America in 
its process so the powerful will run this 
place rather than the people. 
I would love to hear a Senator come 
to this floor and defend these attacks 
on the right to vote because, if you are 
not defending the right to vote, you are 
not defending the Constitution, and 
every one of us took an oath to that 
Constitution. 
We also have a challenge with the 
courts. It is the Supreme Court that 
said that it is OK to have hundreds of 
millions of dollars of dark money—and 
nobody knows where it came from—in 
our elections. Now, if you or I donate 
$100 to someone, it has to be disclosed. 
Everyone knows I made that donation. 
Yet if a powerful corporation or a bil-
lionaire puts $1 million or $100 million 
into an election, he can do it and re-
main in complete secrecy. That is why 
it is called dark money, and that is 
what the Court unleashed with its Citi-
zens United decision. 
Then the Court said: That is not 
enough. We are going to go after voting 
rights by undermining the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act, even though this Chamber 
has reauthorized that act on a bipar-
tisan basis time after time after time. 
First, the Court said in Shelby Coun-
ty v. Holder that preclearance no 
longer applies. So a State that had 
been routinely attempting to block 
citizens from voting no longer had to 
have new changes in its voting laws 
precleared to make sure it did not have 
a prejudicial effect against a targeted 
group of voters. Within days, chambers 
in this country were plotting about 
how to stop people from voting. The 
Supreme Court was maybe just so 
idealistic that they said nobody would 
ever do this again in America and that 
no chamber would ever do this in 
America. If that were right, if that 
were their thought, they were wrong 
because, within days, those plots un-
folded. 
Then we have the most recent Su-
preme Court decision of Brnovich v. 
DNC, and Alito says that making vot-
ing inconvenient doesn’t make access 
unequal. Well, let’s just explain to this 
Justice, who apparently knows nothing 
about how voting really works, that 
when you make it inconvenient for a 
targeted group, you make access un-
equal. It is exactly the intent of these 
laws to make access unequal. Elena 
Kagan, in her dissent, said of the equal 
chance to participate in our democ-
racy—referring to the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act—that this law, of all laws, 
should never be diminished by this 
Court. 
Section 2 is the most recent section 
attacked by the Supreme Court, and it 
bars procedures that result in the de-
nial or abridgement of the right of any 
citizen of the United States to vote on 
account of one’s race or color. Well, 
one of the issues was from Arizona. It 
was a situation wherein you had no 
easy places to drop off your ballot in 
large Native American reservations. So 
by banning the ability of people to col-
lect ballots and drop them off, you es-
sentially make it extraordinarily dif-
ficult for this targeted community to 
vote, and that was the intent. That was 
the intent. 
Now, this law, section 2, didn’t say 
anything about intent. It said the re-
sult. It didn’t say it had to be a denial. 
It said an abridgement—in other words, 
an infringement—on the ability to cast 
a ballot, but Alito doesn’t care. The 
majority on the Supreme Court doesn’t 
care about defending the right to vote, 
the pulsating heart of our Republic. 
So where does that leave us? It leaves 
us as the critical factor to defend the 
Constitution. 
The 
Supreme 
Court 
won’t do it. The States are under-
mining it. It is our responsibility—our 
responsibility—to set out those basic 
standards that defend the ability of 
every American to vote. That is why I 
am here on the floor tonight, talking 
about the For the People Act. 
It is called S. 1. Why? Because de-
fending the right to vote is our No. 1 
responsibility. That is the challenge we 
face, and if we fail in this challenge, 
then across this country, in State after 
State after State, communities are 
being targeted to make it hard for 
them to vote, and it will be harder for 
them to vote. It will change the out-
come, and it will destroy the idea of 
equal representation. We cannot let 
that happen. 
Today, I met with members of the 
Texas Legislature. They have come 
here in order to stop the Texas House 
of Representatives from passing these 
types of laws that are targeted at stop-
ping specific groups from voting. 
What are the types of laws that are 
being considered by the Texas Legisla-
ture right now? One is they don’t like 
the idea of Christian communities vot-
ing on Sundays and getting in buses to 
go to the polls together. They call it 
Souls to the Polls. So they said: Do you 
know what? It will be against the law 
for more than three of you to get in a 
car and drive together to the polls. Are 
you kidding me? Has anybody heard of 
the right of association? Are any Sen-
ators here caring about defending the 
right of association in our Constitu-
tion? 
Can you imagine something so dia-
bolical as to say: ‘‘All three of you can 
get in a car but not four,’’ and ‘‘Do you 
know why? Because we want to stop 
you from using vans or buses to go 
vote’’? That is crazy. It is as crazy as 
the Georgia effort to stop people from 
passing out water in long voter lines. 
What else is the Texas Legislature 
trying to do? 
It is infringing on overnight voting, 
voting for people who have long hours, 
who are working during the day. Over-
night voting really made the ballot ac-
cessible. 
They are attacking drive-through 
voting. They are attacking online reg-
istration. They are attacking assist-
ance to disabled Americans. They are 
making it easier to purge voters off the 
lists of voters, the registration lists. 
They even have in that bill stopping 
election workers from sending out ab-
sentee ballot applications. Is it a crime 
to be able to help your fellow citizen 
apply for a ballot? Yes, if Texas passes 
that law. 
They are also engaged in a process of 
voter intimidation by allowing par-
tisan poll watchers to freely intimidate 
voters. That is wrong on so many lev-
els. Intimidation is something that has 
a long history in our country. It is a 
very racist history. I remember one of 
the stories after the Civil War. You had 
a situation wherein you formed a group 
of horses surrounding a ballot poll 
place to prevent Black Americans from 
being able to get to the polls to vote. 
There are all kinds of other voter in-
timidation strategies. They were racist 
strategies. These efforts to stop Black 
Americans from voting are racist strat-
egies. It is simply, simply wrong, and 
we have the responsibility to end these 
practices. The effort to silence the 
voices of the American people, to stop 
them from having a say through their 
votes, is just fundamental to the vision 
of a government of, by, and for the peo-
ple. 
Citizens wonder why it is they are 
hearing that billionaires don’t pay any 
taxes and that some of the most profit-
able corporations in America don’t pay

any taxes. Well, it goes back to the 
many advantages the wealthy have in 
influencing the outcomes. Those reams 
of liars, those platoons of lobbyists, 
those media campaigns, that dark 
money, and now the effort to block the 
ballot box, that is how afraid the pow-
erful are that the voice of the people 
will say: Invest in American families 
rather than tax breaks for billionaires. 
Tackle healthcare and housing and 
education. 
Create 
living-wage 
jobs 
rather than new tax cuts for the al-
ready wealthy and influential. 
What we have is a battle between the 
powerful and privileged holding onto 
their lever of power, trembling at the 
idea that American voters can get to 
the polls and determine to block it. 
They are afraid that, if voters can get 
to the polls, they might elect people 
who are fighting for Main Street rather 
than Wall Street. They are afraid they 
might invest—those elected individ-
uals—in 
quality, 
affordable 
healthcare—and healthcare should be a 
right, not a privilege—that we might 
invest in housing because there is a 
tremendous housing shortage across 
America and that we might invest in 
education because education is the 
path to success in our complex society. 
So how do we address this? We pass 
S. 1, the For the People Act. We do it 
by following the example of men and 
women who sat in this Chamber half a 
century ago and used their power to 
pass the 1965 Voting Rights Act to give 
every American a full opportunity to 
vote. 
Once again, this more than half a 
century later, we are called upon to 
fight to defend our Constitution, to de-
fend the ‘‘we the people’’ vision and en-
sure that every American can freely 
and fairly cast a ballot. 
This bill sets out basic national 
standards for how elections are con-
ducted in accordance with the con-
stitutional power specifically stated 
for Congress to be able to so set such 
standards to ensure that every Amer-
ican has equal freedom to vote, equal 
opportunity regardless of who they are, 
the color of their skin, or where they 
live. It ensures this access by pro-
tecting vote-by-mail, early voting, and 
fairness on ballot drop boxes. 
Why are early voting and vote-by- 
mail so scary to the powerful? Here is 
why. On election day, there are so 
many ways to stop people from voting. 
First of all, you reduce the number of 
precincts in the communities you don’t 
want to vote, so there are fewer places 
to vote. Then you put them in places 
where there is no parking. That makes 
it harder. Then you reduce the number 
of precinct workers in those locations, 
so there are really long lines. You have 
heard about those lines—3 hours, 4 
hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours. Then 
you tell people you can’t even give peo-
ple a glass of water to those who are 
waiting in those lines. Then you in-
timidate people by allowing partisan 
poll watchers to hover over people 
while they vote or one single person to 
challenge the legitimacy of the right 
to vote of every single person who 
walks in that door, because that is an-
other one of the bills that is being 
passed in State after State. 
Election day can be easily manipu-
lated, and there are even more ways to 
do it. One is—and this happens—you 
send out false information about what 
day is election day. You send out texts 
that say: So sorry you missed the elec-
tion last Tuesday. Hope you make it to 
the polls next time. 
So people think they missed the vote. 
They are, like, well, I thought it was 
next Tuesday, but I got this text, so it 
was last Tuesday. 
You put out false information about 
where the voting location is. You pro-
ceed to make sure you change the loca-
tion from the previous time so people 
get confused about where to go and 
vote in the wrong precinct, and then 
you make it illegal for their vote to be 
counted if they voted in the wrong pre-
cinct. 
Election day is easy to manipulate. 
The antidote is early voting and vote- 
by-mail, and that is why the powerful 
are attacking early voting and vote-by- 
mail. 
Now, my State, Oregon, was the first 
State to adopt vote-by-mail. It did so 
when we had a Republican house and a 
Republican senate in my State. Utah 
was a major early State to do vote-by- 
mail. It is considered a red State, a Re-
publican State. This isn’t blue or red. 
This is American. This is our Constitu-
tion. 
A second thing that the For the Peo-
ple Act does is stop billionaires from 
buying elections with dark money. You 
know, no matter if you poll Repub-
licans, Independents, or Democrats, 
they all believe billionaires shouldn’t 
be able to buy elections with dark 
money. They know that if a billionaire 
can create the equivalent of a stadium 
sound system that drowns out the 
voice of the people, that that is just 
wrong. 
Think about how Americans thought 
of those early debates in the town 
square. Everyone got their chance to 
stand up and have their say. You didn’t 
allow someone to erect a big sound sys-
tem to drown out the people you didn’t 
want to speak. No. Give everyone—that 
is kind of the heart, isn’t it, of our 
First Amendment? Free speech. Every-
one should be able to have their voice 
heard and not be drowned out by adver-
tisements by anonymous billionaires 
buying elections. 
The third thing this act does is it 
ends partisan gerrymandering. It cre-
ates independent Commissions—equal 
numbers of Republicans, Democrats, 
Independents—and therefore fights for 
the vision of equal representation. 
Now, I have heard some folks sali-
vating over increased gerrymandering, 
hoping to influence that other institu-
tion down the hall, saying: Hey, we 
have an extra 15 votes we shouldn’t 
have right now. Let’s get 25 with in-
creased gerrymandering. 
Well, it is just wrong to attack the 
principle of equal representation. You 
don’t have equal representation if the 
system is rigged so that politicians 
choose their voters rather than voters 
choosing their politicians. 
The fourth thing the For the People 
Act does, it takes on ethics reforms 
and targets corruption. Again, whether 
you ask Democrats, Republicans, or 
Independents, they want the corrup-
tion out of our system. They want to 
ensure that public officials serve the 
public, not some private cause or serve 
themselves; that we are going to do the 
people’s business, not the business of 
some outside billionaire or some out-
side corporation. 
These principles are widely supported 
across the country. The people some-
times say: Why don’t you have any Re-
publican sponsors on this bill? Why 
don’t Republicans support this bill? 
Across this Nation, Republicans over-
whelmingly support these four prin-
ciples in this bill. It is incredibly bipar-
tisan. But not here in this Chamber be-
cause here is where the powerful speak, 
and the minority leader has said: I am 
going to lock down my Senators from 
supporting these efforts to defend our 
Constitution. 
I would be embarrassed—I would be 
embarrassed if a leader of a caucus said 
it is going to lock me down to prevent 
me from defending the Constitution. I 
would be more than embarrassed; I 
would be alarmed. I would be outraged, 
as should every Member of this body 
across the aisle—should be outraged 
that they are being told they are 
locked down from defending the Con-
stitution. 
Next month, America will celebrate 
the 56th anniversary of the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act, the most powerful, signifi-
cant advancement this Nation has ever 
made to realize that ‘‘we the people’’ 
vision of America. 
Lyndon Johnson called August 6, 
1965—the day he signed that law—‘‘a 
triumph for freedom as huge as any 
victory that has ever been won on any 
battlefield.’’ He said: ‘‘The heart of the 
act is plain. Wherever, by clear and ob-
jective standards, States and counties 
use regulations, or laws, or tests to 
deny the right to vote, then they will 
be struck down.’’ 
Well, that is our job, to do what 
President Johnson thought was accom-
plished when he signed the Voting 
Rights Act—to strike down regula-
tions, laws, or tests designed to deny 
the right to vote to targeted groups of 
Americans across this country. So let’s 
do our job. Put this bill on the floor, 
and get it passed. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

REMEMBERING DETECTIVE GREG 
FERENCY 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, Hoosiers 
have one less hero. On July 7, Detec-
tive Greg Ferency died in the line of 
duty in Terre Haute, IN. This is a trag-
ic loss for his community and our 
State. Greg’s life was dedicated to pro-
tecting people, pursuing justice, and 
preventing violence. 
For 30 years, he served Terre Haute, 
the town where he was born and raised, 
as a police officer; during 10 of those, 
he doubled as a member of a Federal 
Bureau of Investigation task force. 
Greg broke drug rings, battled the 
evil of human trafficking, and helped 
defend places of worship from ter-
rorism. He was constantly on the 
frontlines in the fight against crime, 
leading and securing over 550 meth-
amphetamine lab investigations. He 
was a teacher, too, training team-
mates, leading community forums, and 
authoring a book on drug enforcement. 
A father of two, Greg was admired by 
his police peers and valued by the Fed-
eral agents he worked with. ‘‘You’ll 
never meet a finer person,’’ remem-
bered a colleague. The hundreds of 
friends and fellow officers who paid 
tribute during his funeral bears witness 
to this. 
We mourn his loss, we celebrate his 
life, and we keep his loved ones in our 
hearts and prayers. And we remember 
this: What we call bravery, the men 
and women who wear the badge simply 
call duty. They willingly stand in the 
way of threats to decency and order. 
They face grave dangers so other 
Americans do not have to. 
Greg Ferency was one of these guard-
ians. There are no words to adequately 
express our gratitude to him. I ask my 
colleagues, though, to join me in ex-
tending our sympathies to his family 
and pledging to never forget his sac-
rifice.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
MONIQUE 
LAMOREAUX-MORANDO 
AND 
JOCELYNE 
LAMOREAUX-DAVID-
SON 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want 
to congratulate the newest recipients 
of the North Dakota Theodore Roo-
sevelt Rough Rider Award, who are 
being honored in their hometown of 
Grand Forks today. They are Monique 
Lamoureux-Morando 
and 
Jocelyne 
Lamoureux-Davidson, better known as 
the Lamoureux Twins. 
Before the rest of the world knew 
them, these identical twins made a 
name for themselves in North Dakota. 
Those of us with children their same 
age who competed with them on soccer 
and hockey teams were well aware of 
their talents. 
Monique and Jocelyne grew up in a 
hockey family. Their father was a goal-
tender for the University of North Da-
kota team, and they joined their four 
older brothers in learning the sport at 
an early age. Girls’ hockey was not 
well developed in the 1990s, so they 
played on boys’ teams, leading one of 
those teams to a State championship 
when they were 12 years old. 
While playing hockey at Shattuck- 
St. Mary’s Prep School in Minnesota, 
they were named to the U.S. Four Na-
tions team as high school juniors in 
2006. Three years later in 2009, the 
hockey world became more aware of 
these twin powerhouses from North Da-
kota. While playing collegiate hockey 
for the University of Minnesota, they 
made the World Championship team 
that won the Gold Medal in Finland. 
They then transferred to the Univer-
sity of North Dakota to finish their 
college hockey careers and that De-
cember were named to the 2010 Olympic 
team. 
They have played on three Winter 
Olympics women’s hockey teams, the 
first two in Vancouver, Canada, in 2010 
and Sochi, Russia, in 2014, where the 
U.S. team won Silver Medals against 
Canada. It was on February 18, 2018, in 
PyeongChang, South Korea, when the 
sisters were at the center of what is 
considered one of the greatest mo-
ments in U.S. Olympic history. 
With 21 seconds remaining in regula-
tion play, Monique scored the tying 
goal—again 
against 
the 
Canadian 
women. Jocelyn then sealed the win in 
the sixth round of the tie-breaking 
shootout. Her now famous ‘‘Oops, I did 
it again’’ shot scored the goal and 
brought the women’s Olympic Gold 
Medal home to the United States for 
the first time in 20 years. 
After 14 years as members of Team 
USA hockey, in February they retired 
from their golden careers. While on 
Team USA, Monique skated in 135 
games and scored 143 points, and 
Jocelyne skated in 137 games and 
scored 138 points. From 2009 to 2018, 
they played in every major Inter-
national Ice Hockey Federation event. 
They have brought home an impressive 
number of medals, including one Olym-
pic Gold, two Olympic Silver, six World 
Championship Gold and one World 
Championship Silver. They made his-
tory in North Dakota in 2014 for being 
the first State athletes to win multiple 
Olympic medals. 
The Lamoureux Twins have been 
widely 
praised 
by 
teammates 
and 
coaches for their perseverance and 
adaptability. Often noted when describ-
ing them are their work ethic, focus, 
grit, determination, attention to de-
tail, class, respect, and integrity. They 
have been called humble, tough, and 
generous. They have a clear sense of 
right and wrong and are always chal-
lenging each other to be better. One 
sportswriter described the Lamoureux 
Twins as ‘‘having work ethics that 
would put a combustion engine to 
shame.’’ 
These young women have been wit-
ness to and instrumental in the growth 
of women’s hockey on and off the ice. 
Today, with women’s hockey much 
more prominent than it was 20 years 
ago, they sponsor and conduct hockey 
camps to better train girls and women 
players. In 2017, they were among those 
on the U.S. national team who threat-
ened a boycott before the Women’s 
World Championship to highlight the 
need for better financial support and 
benefits for women team players. 
Today, Monique and Jocelyne live in 
Grand Forks with their husbands and 
young families. They published a book, 
‘‘Dare to Make History,’’ earlier this 
year, and they have established a char-
itable foundation to support under-
privileged children through education 
and by promoting gender equality and 
internet access for low income fami-
lies. 
The North Dakota Theodore Roo-
sevelt Rough Rider Award was estab-
lished in 1961. It recognizes North Da-
kotans who have been influenced by 
the State in achieving national rec-
ognition in their fields of endeavor, 
thereby reflecting credit and honor 
upon North Dakota and its citizens. It 
was named after President Theodore 
Roosevelt, who credited his time living 
in North Dakota for influencing his 
success later in life. We can only imag-
ine what his reaction would be to the 
accomplishments 
of 
Monique 
and 
Jocelyne. As only the 45th and 46th re-
cipients, at age 32, they are the young-
est to be honored with this highest 
award given by the State, and they 
have a lifetime ahead of themselves for 
even more impressive achievements. 
Mr. President, on behalf of the citi-
zens of North Dakota, I congratulate 
Monique 
Lamoureux-Morando 
and 
Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson on re-
ceiving the North Dakota Theodore 
Roosevelt Rough Rider Award today. 
You are true champions.∑

TRIBUTE TO RON PISANESCHI 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch 
and Representatives MIKE SIMPSON and 
RUSS
FULCHER, I congratulate Ron 
Pisaneschi on his remarkable more 
than 35-year career with Idaho Public 
Television. 
Ron is retiring after serving as Idaho 
Public Television’s general manager 
since August 2013. He joined Idaho Pub-
lic Television in 1985 and served in nu-
merous positions for the station prior 
to his managerial role. This includes 
serving as director of content, director 
of programming, director of public in-
formation, and director of marketing 
and development. We understand under 
his leadership of the station, Idaho 
Public Television has been one of the 
most watched and best supported Pub-
lic Broadcasting Service, PBS, stations

per capita in the Nation. Douglas Bal-
four, president of the Friends of Idaho 
Public Television, wrote, ‘‘With his 
leadership, IdahoPTV has focused on 
the wonderful people and places we 
have in the Gem State, with local pro-
ductions like Idaho Reports, Outdoor 
Idaho and Idaho Experience. Ron will 
be missed, but we will carry on in the 
tradition he established.’’ 
Ron has also contributed extensively 
of his time and talents to serving in 
various roles throughout the commu-
nity, State, and Nation. This includes 
his service as vice chair of the NETA 
board of directors, chair of the Idaho 
State Broadcasters Association, and 
member of the board of directors of 
American Public Television. Ron dedi-
cated more than 25 years to serving on 
the PBS Children’s Advisory Com-
mittee. He also served on the board of 
directors of the Public Television Pro-
gramming Association from 2002–2007, 
serving as president in 2006. From 2002– 
2012, he served on the board of directors 
of the Idaho Humanities Council, where 
he served two terms as chairman. 
These are just a few examples of his 
longtime involvement in numerous 
leadership roles and advisory panels. 
His dedicated work has earned recogni-
tion, including Ron being named the 
2005 Programmer of the Year by his 
colleagues in the PBS system. 
Ron, thank you for your commit-
ment to advancing public discussions 
in Idaho for all these years. Your curi-
osity, ingenuity, and thoughtful advo-
cacy for Idaho interests have no doubt 
contributed significantly to broadening 
understanding, educational opportuni-
ties, and public discourse across Idaho 
and well beyond our State’s borders. 
We will miss you at the helm of Idaho 
Public Television but wish you all the 
best in a well-earned retirement.∑

RECOGNIZING GLAUBER’S SPORTS 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Glauber’s Sports, a family- 
owned small business in Carrollton, 
KY, as the Senate Small Business of 
the Week. 
In 1863, a young shoemaker, John 
Glauber, established Glauber’s Shoes in 
Carrollton, KY. Opening up shop on 
Main Street, the business provided 
quality footwear to residents of Carroll 
County and the surrounding area. Over 
the next 140 years, Glauber’s Shoes be-
came the oldest shoe store in Kentucky 
and over time expanded its offerings to 
include 
hunting 
supplies. 
Passing 
through multiple generations, by the 
early 2000s, John Glauber, a fourth-gen-
eration descendant of the original 
owner, ran the business alongside his 
son, Randy, who started helping out 
around the shop when he was in the 
sixth grade. After graduating from 
high school, Randy worked in the store 
full time and learned how to run the 
family business. He later took over 
when his father retired in 2005. Since 
taking over, Randy further expanded 
the store’s hunting inventory and re-
named the store to Glauber’s Sports to 
more accurately reflect its inventory. 
Today, Glauber’s Sports is lauded as 
a one-stop-shop for hunting and shoot-
ing sports enthusiasts in Northern Ken-
tucky. Praised for great customer serv-
ice, Randy has demonstrated a dy-
namic approach to managing the store, 
actively responding to local market de-
mands by expanding its stock and en-
suring the needs of the community are 
met. To accommodate its growing in-
ventory, Glauber’s Sports moved loca-
tions from Main Street to Fourth 
Street in 2007. With over 1000 firearms 
in stock, the store carries a wide range 
of rifles and shotguns. Additionally, 
Glauber’s Sports sells other supplies 
like muzzle loaders, crossbows, outdoor 
wear, hunting blinds, and scopes. Look-
ing to the future, Randy is committed 
to continuing the family tradition of 
serving Carrollton and is training his 
son, John, to take over the 158-year-old 
business for decades to come. 
A pillar of the community, Glauber’s 
Sports is actively involved with var-
ious local organizations. Over the dec-
ades, Glauber’s has supported area 
schools’ sports teams and events like 
the Carroll County Fair. Furthermore, 
Randy regularly volunteers with local 
shooting 
sports 
organizations 
by 
coaching the Carroll County High 
School trap club and 4–H shooting 
sports clubs and by doing so passes on 
a lifelong passion for shooting sports, 
gun safety, and his support for the Sec-
ond Amendment. Additionally, like 
many other small businesses, Glauber’s 
Sports is a member of the National 
Federation of Independent Businesses 
and the Chamber of Commerce. 
Glauber’s Sports is a remarkable ex-
ample of the resilience and adapt-
ability of family-owned small busi-
nesses. Small businesses, like Glauber’s 
Sports, form the heart of towns across 
Kentucky by regularly stepping up to 
support the needs of their commu-
nities. Congratulations to Randy, the 
Glauber family, and the entire team at 
Glauber’s Sports. I wish Glauber’s 
Sports the best of luck and look for-
ward to watching this family-business’ 
continued growth and success in Ken-
tucky.

TRIBUTE TO RENEE LIMOGE 
REEVE 
∑ Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
would like to recognize a critical mem-
ber of my staff, my former State Direc-
tor Rene´e Limoge Reeve, who left my 
office in June to become the vice presi-
dent of Government & Community Re-
lations at Cruise Lines International 
Association, or CLIA, Alaska. It is a 
big and important job for Alaska, and 
all of us with Team Sullivan are con-
fident she will do a great job. 
As a student at the University of 
Vermont, Rene´e explored her passions 
for government and English. After 
graduation, Rene´e left Vermont to 
start a new journey in Alaska. 
Rene´e’s work in Alaska began over a 
decade ago as an aide for the State leg-
islature. In Juneau, Rene´e honed her 
skills for communication and leader-
ship—fostering a fun and collaborative 
team environment. 
I was honored when Rene´e joined 
Team Sullivan in 2018. As the director 
of my State office, Rene´e was the boots 
on the ground where our presence mat-
ters most. Enthusiastic and sharp, 
Rene´e was the ultimate liaison be-
tween Federal, State, and Tribal gov-
ernments, and, most importantly, the 
people of Alaska, to whom she was ulti-
mately committed. 
Leadership is the measure of how we 
connect with people, empathize, and 
make others feel welcome. Rene´e is an 
outstanding leader. She has a keen po-
litical perspective and unrivaled wit. 
Rene´e’s talents for communication 
and humor culminated in her famous 
get-togethers. Rene´e is known for gath-
ering people from all walks of life 
around good food, occasional adult 
prom parties, and always, laughter. 
We wish her the best as Rene´e sets 
sail on her new adventure. 
While she is no longer on my staff, 
Rene´e will always be a member of the 
Sullivan family. Please join me in 
wishing Rene´e success in her future. 
She will be missed.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. 
CASEY, 
Ms. 
HASSAN, 
Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, 
Mr. 
REED, 
Mr. 
WYDEN, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, and 
Ms. ROSEN): 
S. 2344. A bill to award grants for the 
creation, recruitment, training and 
education, retention, and advancement 
of the direct care workforce and to 
award grants to support family care-
givers; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. With a 
growing number of older adults and 
people with disabilities in the U.S., our 
Nation is becoming increasingly reli-
ant on the direct care workforce and 
family caregivers who support older 
adults and people with disabilities. Un-
fortunately, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has accelerated this need. 
The direct care workforce, such as di-
rect support workers, home care work-
ers, personal care workers or other 
paid workers who support older adults 
and people with disabilities in their 
homes and communities, has long expe-
rienced staffing shortages in part be-
cause of low wages and high turnover. 
Currently, 4.5 million workers—includ-
ing nearly 2.3 million home care work-
ers—make up the direct care work-
force, and this industry is expected to 
grow by more than a million jobs by 
2028, not including the jobs that will 
need to be filled as existing workers 
leave the field or exit the labor force. 
The shortage of direct care workers 
often puts pressure on family care-
givers. The number of American care-
givers providing unpaid caregiving has 
increased over the past 5 years, and 23 
percent 
of 
caregivers 
say 
that 
caregiving 
has 
made 
their 
health 
worse. 
Today, I am pleased to introduce the 
Supporting Our Direct Care Workforce 
and Family Caregivers Act along with 
my colleagues Senators BOB
CASEY, 
MAGGIE
HASSAN, TAMMY
DUCKWORTH, 
JACK REED, RON WYDEN, KIRSTEN GILLI-
BRAND, and JACKY ROSEN. Our legisla-
tion would direct the Department of 
Health and Human Services, through 
the Administration on Community Liv-
ing (ACL), to award grants to states or 
other eligible entities for initiatives to 
build, retain, train and educate, and 
promote the direct care workforce, in-
cluding self-directed workers and di-
rect care supervisors or managers, and 
to provide education and training sup-
port for family caregivers to help ease 
stresses associated with caregiving. 
Grants 
could 
be 
used 
for 
preapprenticeship and on-the-job train-
ing opportunities, apprenticeship pro-
grams, career ladders or pathways, spe-
cializations or certification or other 
activities to recruit and retain direct 
care professionals in the field. Addi-
tionally, the bill creates a technical as-
sistance center at ACL to bolster co-
ordination across Federal agencies, 
provide consultation to States, and 
make policy recommendations to sup-
port the direct care workforce and fam-
ily caregivers. 
The bill aligns with President Biden’s 
American Jobs Plan, which calls for 
substantial investments to meet the 
demand for home and community- 
based services and invests in our coun-
try’s care infrastructure. I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
see the Supporting Our Direct Care 
Workforce and Family Caregivers Act 
as an opportunity to invest in the di-
rect care workforce and family care-
givers—both critical pieces of the care 
team who provide support for millions 
of Americans every day, ensuring they 
can live their lives independently and 
with dignity. 
By Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina 
(for himself and Mrs. SHAHEEN): 
S. 2348. A bill to establish within the 
Office of Entrepreneurial Development 
of the Small Business Administration a 
training curriculum relating to busi-
nesses owned by older individuals, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Small Business and Entrepreneur-
ship. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, American entrepreneurship 
and innovation is the backbone of the 
American economy. American entre-
preneurs provide new job opportunities 
for millions, bring new technologies to 
the marketplace, and drive forward our 
shared American Dream. Small busi-
nesses account for half of our gross do-
mestic product, more than half our 
jobs, and three-fourths of new jobs cre-
ated each year. Contrary to popular be-
lief, not all of America’s entrepreneurs 
are 
young 
tech-focused 
individuals 
starting companies in their garages. 
In fact, millions of older Americans 
represent a powerful and growing share 
of American entrepreneurs. Today, the 
average age of successful entrepreneurs 
in America is 45, and in 2018, 3 in 10 en-
trepreneurs were over the age of 50, an 
increase of 50 percent since 2007. Today, 
entrepreneurs ages 55 and over rep-
resent 55 percent of all small business 
employers. Not only do seniors rep-
resent the majority of small business 
employers, but their life experiences 
help drive their businesses to the top 
0.1 percent of the highest growth 
startups in the country based on 
growth in the first 5 years of operation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4903 
July 14, 2021 
In my conversations with older en-
trepreneurs in South Carolina. I have 
learned how they combine their years 
of experience, networks. and dreams to 
start countless successful small busi-
nesses. I have also learned that older 
entrepreneurs often face unique chal-
lenges in today’s economy. Those chal-
lenges include the need for enhanced 
digital and technical skills. mentorship 
opportunities, business growth and hir-
ing training; along with resources for 
estate and retirement planning for 
their businesses. These obstacles can 
prevent small businesses owned by 
older Americans from reaching their 
full growth potential. This untapped 
business growth potential leaves cap-
ital on the sidelines and slows innova-
tion and job creation. 
That is why today I am introducing 
the Golden-preneurship Act. The Gold-
en-preneurship Act would take a mean-
ingful step in helping catapult senior- 
owned small businesses into the next 
level of success by establishing a new 
training program for ‘‘Golden Entre-
preneurs’’ at the Small Business Ad-
ministration. 
The 
newly 
developed 
‘‘Golden Entrepreneurs’’ training pro-
gram would equip proven senior entre-
preneurs with the necessary tools to 
increase their business’s market share 
and help bring jobs and capital to com-
munities around the country. ‘‘Golden 
Entrepreneurs’’ would be a 7-month 
training program with two years of 
benchmark check-ins to fill the market 
gap and bridge the knowledge divide in 
digital and technical skills, business 
growth and hiring training, estate and 
retirement business planning, and pro-
vide new mentorship opportunities. 
The Golden-preneurship Act also re-
quires the Small Business Administra-
tion to track the loans and grants pro-
vided to older Americans, valuable in-
formation we need to ensure America’s 
older entrepreneurs are receiving the 
help they need. 
With the Golden-preneurship Act we 
will ensure that today’s Golden Entre-
preneurs have the tools and resources 
to create tomorrow’s jobs, new tech-
nologies, and opportunities. 
Thank you. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. 
MERKLEY, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, 
and Mr. WHITEHOUSE): 
S. 2349. A bill to amend the Truth in 
Lending Act to establish a national 
usury rate for consumer credit trans-
actions; to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 2349 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting 
Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) attempts have been made to prohibit 
usurious interest rates in America since co-
lonial times; 
(2) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress 
enacted a Federal 36-percent annualized 
usury cap for servicemembers and their fam-
ilies for covered credit products, as defined 
by the Department of Defense, which curbed 
payday, car title, and tax refund lending 
around military bases; 
(3) notwithstanding such attempts to curb 
predatory lending, high-cost lending persists 
in all 50 States due to loopholes in State 
laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms of 
credit, and the exportation of unregulated 
interest rates permitted by preemption; 
(4) due to the lack of a comprehensive Fed-
eral usury cap, consumers have paid as much 
as approximately $14,000,000,000 on high-cost 
overdraft loans, $9,000,000,000 on storefront 
and online payday loans, $3,800,000,000 on car 
title loans, and additional amounts in unre-
ported revenues on high-cost online install-
ment loans; 
(5) cash-strapped consumers pay on aver-
age approximately 400-percent annual inter-
est for payday loans, 300-percent annual in-
terest for car title loans, 17,000 percent for 
bank overdraft loans, and triple-digit rates 
for online installment loans; 
(6) a national maximum interest rate that 
includes all forms of fees and closes all loop-
holes is necessary to eliminate such preda-
tory lending; and 
(7) alternatives to predatory lending that 
encourage small dollar loans with minimal 
or no fees, installment payment schedules, 
and affordable repayment periods should be 
encouraged. 
SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE. 
Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 
U.S.C. 1631 et seq.) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘SEC. 140B. MAXIMUM RATES OF INTEREST. 
‘‘(a) IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, no creditor may make 
an extension of credit to a consumer with re-
spect to which the fee and interest rate, as 
defined in subsection (b), exceeds 36 percent. 
‘‘(b) FEE AND INTEREST RATE DEFINED.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sec-
tion, the fee and interest rate includes all 
charges payable, directly or indirectly, inci-
dent to, ancillary to, or as a condition of the 
extension of credit, including— 
‘‘(A) any payment compensating a creditor 
or prospective creditor for— 
‘‘(i) an extension of credit or making avail-
able a line of credit, such as fees connected 
with credit extension or availability such as 
numerical periodic rates, annual fees, cash 
advance fees, and membership fees; or 
‘‘(ii) any fees for default or breach by a 
borrower of a condition upon which credit 
was extended, such as late fees, creditor-im-
posed not sufficient funds fees charged when 
a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a 
check drawn on insufficient funds, overdraft 
fees, and over limit fees; 
‘‘(B) all fees which constitute a finance 
charge, as defined by rules of the Bureau in 
accordance with this title; 
‘‘(C) credit insurance premiums, whether 
optional or required; and 
‘‘(D) all charges and costs for ancillary 
products sold in connection with or inci-
dental to the credit transaction. 
‘‘(2) TOLERANCES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—With respect to a credit 
obligation that is payable in at least 3 fully 
amortizing installments over at least 90 
days, the term ‘fee and interest rate’ does 
not include— 
‘‘(i) application or participation fees that 
in total do not exceed the greater of $30 or, 
if there is a limit to the credit line, 5 percent 
of the credit limit, up to $120, if— 
‘‘(I) such fees are excludable from the fi-
nance charge pursuant to section 106 and 
regulations issued thereunder; 
‘‘(II) such fees cover all credit extended or 
renewed by the creditor for 12 months; and 
‘‘(III) the minimum amount of credit ex-
tended or available on a credit line is equal 
to $300 or more; 
‘‘(ii) a late fee charged as authorized by 
State law and by the agreement that does 
not exceed either $20 per late payment or $20 
per month; or 
‘‘(iii) a creditor-imposed not sufficient 
funds fee charged when a borrower tenders 
payment on a debt with a check drawn on in-
sufficient funds that does not exceed $15. 
‘‘(B) ADJUSTMENTS
FOR
INFLATION.—The 
Bureau may adjust the amounts of the toler-
ances established under this paragraph for 
inflation over time, consistent with the pri-
mary goals of protecting consumers and en-
suring that the 36-percent fee and interest 
rate limitation is not circumvented. 
‘‘(c) CALCULATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) OPEN END CREDIT PLANS.—For an open 
end credit plan— 
‘‘(A) the fee and interest rate shall be cal-
culated each month, based upon the sum of 
all fees and finance charges described in sub-
section (b) charged by the creditor during 
the preceding 1-year period, divided by the 
average daily balance; and 
‘‘(B) if the credit account has been open 
less than 1 year, the fee and interest rate 
shall be calculated based upon the total of 
all fees and finance charges described in sub-
section (b)(1) charged by the creditor since 
the plan was opened, divided by the average 
daily 
balance, 
and 
multiplied 
by 
the 
quotient of 12 divided by the number of full 
months that the credit plan has been in ex-
istence. 
‘‘(2) OTHER CREDIT PLANS.—For purposes of 
this section, in calculating the fee and inter-
est rate, the Bureau shall require the method 
of calculation of annual percentage rate 
specified in section 107(a)(1), except that the 
amount referred to in that section 107(a)(1) 
as the ‘finance charge’ shall include all fees, 
charges, and payments described in sub-
section (b)(1) of this section. 
‘‘(3) ADJUSTMENTS
AUTHORIZED.—The Bu-
reau may make adjustments to the calcula-
tions in paragraphs (1) and (2), but the pri-
mary goals of such adjustment shall be to 
protect consumers and to ensure that the 36- 
percent fee and interest rate limitation is 
not circumvented. 
‘‘(d) DEFINITION OF CREDITOR.—As used in 
this section, the term ‘creditor’ has the same 
meaning as in section 702(e) of the Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691a(e)). 
‘‘(e) NO EXEMPTIONS PERMITTED.—The ex-
emption authority of the Bureau under sec-
tion 105 shall not apply to the rates estab-
lished under this section or the disclosure re-
quirements under section 127(b)(6). 
‘‘(f) DISCLOSURE OF FEE AND INTEREST RATE 
FOR CREDIT OTHER THAN OPEN END CREDIT 
PLANS.—In addition to the disclosure re-
quirements under section 127(b)(6), the Bu-
reau may prescribe regulations requiring dis-
closure of the fee and interest rate estab-
lished under this section. 
‘‘(g) RELATION TO STATE LAW.—Nothing in 
this section may be construed to preempt 
any provision of State law that provides 
greater protection to consumers than is pro-
vided in this section. 
‘‘(h) CIVIL LIABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT.—In 
addition to remedies available to the con-
sumer under section 130(a), any payment 
compensating a creditor or prospective cred-
itor, to the extent that such payment is a 
transaction made in violation of this section, 
shall be null and void, and not enforceable by

subsection (c) and inserting the following: 
‘‘(c)(1) Sums deposited in the Fund shall 
remain in the Fund and be available for ex-
penditure under this chapter for grants 
under this chapter without fiscal year limi-
tation, in accordance with paragraph (2). 
Notwithstanding subsection (d)(5), all sums 
deposited in the Fund in any fiscal year that 
are not made available for obligation by 
Congress in the subsequent fiscal year shall 
remain in the Fund for obligation in future 
fiscal years, without fiscal year limitation. 
‘‘(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph 
(C), it shall not be in order in the Senate or 
the House of Representatives to consider a 
provision in a bill or joint resolution making 
appropriations for all or a portion of a fiscal 
year, or an amendment thereto, amendment 
between the Houses in relation thereto, con-
ference report thereon, or motion thereon, 
that would cause the amount of annual 
disbursals from the Fund below the annual 
average amount that was deposited into the 
Fund during the 3-fiscal-year period begin-
ning on October 1 of the fourth fiscal year 
before the fiscal year to which the disbursal 
level applies. 
‘‘(B) If a point of order is raised by a Mem-
ber under subparagraph (A), and the point of 
order is sustained by the Chair, the provision 
shall be stricken from the measure and may 
not be offered as an amendment from the 
floor. 
‘‘(C) A point of order shall not lie in the 
Senate or the House of Representatives 
under this paragraph if the difference be-
tween the amount in the Fund as of Sep-
tember 30 of the fiscal year immediately pre-
ceding the fiscal year to which the annual 
disbursals described in subparagraph (A) re-
lates and the amount available for obligation

tain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on 
a point of order raised under paragraph (2). 
‘‘(4) This subsection is enacted by Con-
gress— 
‘‘(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking 
power of the House of Representatives and 
the Senate, respectively, and as such it is 
deemed a part of the rules of each House, re-
spectively, but applicable only with respect 
to the procedure to be followed in that House 
in the case of a joint resolution, and it super-
sedes other rules only to the extent that it is 
inconsistent with those rules; and

tional right of either House to change the 
rules (so far as relating to the procedure of 
that House) at any time, in the same manner

proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 87, S. 65. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 65) to ensure that goods made 
with forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region of the People’s Republic of 
China do not enter the United States mar-
ket, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Foreign Relations, with an amend-
ment to strike all after the enacting 
clause and insert in lieu thereof the 
following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion of the People’s Republic of China, the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China has, 
since April 2017, arbitrarily detained more than 
1,000,000 Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tibetans, 
and members of other persecuted groups in a 
system of extrajudicial mass internment camps, 
and has subjected detainees to forced labor, tor-
ture, political indoctrination, and other severe 
human rights abuses. 
(2) Forced labor, a severe form of human traf-
ficking, exists within the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region’s system of mass internment 
camps, and throughout the region, and is con-
firmed by the testimony of former camp detain-
ees, satellite imagery, and official leaked docu-
ments from the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China as part of a targeted campaign 
of repression of Muslim ethnic minorities. 
(3) Researchers and civil society groups have 
issued reports documenting evidence that many 
factories and other suppliers in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region are exploiting 
forced labor, on July 22, 2020, the Bureau of In-
dustry and Security of the Department of Com-
merce added 11 entities to the Entity List set 
forth in Supplement No. 4 to part 744 of title 15, 
Code of Federal Regulations, after determining 
the entities had been ‘‘implicated in human 
rights violations and abuses in the implementa-
tion of China’s campaign of repression, mass ar-
bitrary detention, forced labor and high-tech-
nology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, 
Kyrgyz, Tibetans, and members of other per-
secuted groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region’’. 
(4) Since October 2019, the Bureau of Industry 
and Security of the Department of Commerce 
has added a total of 48 entities of the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China to the 
Entity List set forth in Supplement No. 4 to part 
744 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, in 
connection with their implication in human 
rights abuses in the implementation of China’s 
campaign of repression, mass arbitrary deten-
tion, forced labor, and high-technology surveil-
lance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other 
members of Muslim minority groups in the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. As a con-
sequence of their addition to the Entity List, 
comprehensive restrictions apply to the export, 
reexport, and in-country transfer of most United 
States-origin items to those 48 entities. Audits 
and traditional due diligence efforts to vet goods 
and supply chains in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region are unreliable for identifying 
the absence of forced labor in the production of 
goods because of interference by the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China, including 
through intimidation of potential witnesses and 
concealment of relevant information. 
(5) Reports cited by the Department of Labor 
estimate that hundreds of thousands of ex-de-
tainees who are Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Ti-
betans, or members of other persecuted groups in 
the People’s Republic of China may be working 
in conditions of forced labor following detention 
in re-education camps. Moreover, nongovern-
mental organizations estimate that more than 
80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to work 
in factories across the People’s Republic of 
China between 2017 and 2019, and some of them 
were sent directly from detention camps. 
(6) The Department of State’s June 2020 Traf-
ficking in Persons Report found, ‘‘Authorities 
offer subsidies incentivizing Chinese companies 
to open factories in close proximity to the in-
ternment camps and to receive transferred de-
tainees at satellite manufacturing sites in other 
provinces. Local governments receive additional 
funds for each inmate forced to work in these 
sites at a fraction of minimum wage or without 
any compensation. The government has trans-
ported tens of thousands of these individuals to 
other areas within Xinjiang and to other prov-
inces for forced labor under the guise of poverty 
alleviation and industrial aid programs.’’. 
(7) U.S. Customs and Border Protection has 
issued 11 withhold release orders on goods sus-
pected to be produced with forced labor in the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Goods 
subject to the withhold release orders include all 
cotton, cotton products, tomatoes, and tomato 
products, as well as certain garments, hair prod-
ucts, apparel, computer parts, and other goods. 
(8) In its 2019 annual report, the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China found 
that goods reportedly produced with forced 
labor by current and former mass internment 
camp detainees included textiles, electronics, 
food products, shoes, tea, and handicrafts. 
(9) Under section 1091(a) of title 18, United 
States Code, a person commits genocide if the 
person ‘‘whether in time of peace or in time of 
war and with the specific intent to destroy, in 
whole or in substantial part, a national, ethnic, 
racial, or religious group as such— 
‘‘(1) kills members of that group; 
‘‘(2) causes serious bodily injury to members of 
that group; 
‘‘(3) causes the permanent impairment of the 
mental faculties of members of the group 
through drugs, torture, or similar techniques; 
‘‘(4) subjects the group to conditions of life 
that are intended to cause the physical destruc-
tion of the group in whole or in part; 
‘‘(5) imposes measures intended to prevent 
births within the group; or 
‘‘(6) transfers by force children of the group to 
another group.’’. 
(10) As a direct result of the campaign of tar-
geted and coercive population control of the 
Government of the People’s Republic of China’s 
against Uyghurs, the birthrate of the Uyghur 
population in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region plummeted by 24 percent from 2017 to 
2018, with birthrates in the Uyghur majority re-
gions of Hotan and Kashgar decreasing by more 
than 60 percent from 2015 to 2018. 
(11) The policies of the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China are in contravention 
of its human rights commitments and obliga-
tions, including under— 
(A) the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; 
(B) the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, which the People’s Republic of 
China has signed but not yet ratified; and 
(C) the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Es-
pecially Women and Children (commonly known 
as the ‘‘Palermo Protocol’’), to which the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China has been a state party 
since February 2010. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to strengthen the prohibition against the 
importation of goods made with forced labor, in-
cluding by ensuring that the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China does not undermine 
the effective enforcement of section 307 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307), which pro-
hibits the importation of all ‘‘goods, wares, arti-
cles, and merchandise mined, produced or man-
ufactured wholly or in part in any foreign 
country by . . . forced labor’’; 
(2) to lead the international community in 
ending forced labor practices wherever such 
practices occur through all means available to 
the United States Government, including by 
stopping the importation of any goods made 
with forced labor, including those goods mined, 
produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; 
(3) to actively work to prevent, publicly de-
nounce, and end human trafficking, including 
with respect to forced labor, whether sponsored 
by the government of a foreign country or not, 
and to restore the lives of those affected by 
human trafficking, a modern form of slavery; 
(4) to regard the prevention of atrocities as a 
priority in the national interests of the United 
States; and 
(5) to address gross violations of human rights 
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region— 
(A) through bilateral diplomatic channels and 
multilateral institutions in which both the 
United States and the People’s Republic of 
China are members; and 
(B) using all the authorities available to the 
United States Government, including visa and 
financial sanctions, export restrictions, and im-
port controls.

factured wholly or in part with forced labor; 
and 
(B) what procedures can be implemented or

or 
services 
are 
extracted

through the initiation of pilot programs to test 
the viability of technologies to assist in the ex-
amination of such goods. 
(5) Guidance to importers with respect to— 
(A) due diligence, effective supply chain trac-
ing, and supply chain management measures to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4909 
July 14, 2021 
ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, if 
there is no further business to come be-
fore the Senate, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it stand adjourned under the 
previous order, following the remarks 
of Senator BLACKBURN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
before I begin my remarks, I do want 
to respond to my colleague and his 
comments about the For the People 
Act, which the Democratic Party is 
continuing to push. 
Now, I will say that I am pleased to 
learn that many of my Democratic col-
leagues are standing up against the 
Jim Crow-era policies that their party 
put in place, the work that their party 
did with the KKK and other entities to 
block and obstruct access to the voting 
booth. And I will remind him also that 
the 1965 Voting Rights Act was a very 
solidly bipartisan effort that took 
place here in this Chamber. 
And in regard to their S. 1, H.R. 1, 
For The People Act, it is anything but 
the For the People Act. What this 
would do is make it easier to cheat and 
harder to vote. We should be working 
to make it easier to vote and harder to 
cheat. That is what election integrity 
is all about, and that is what the Amer-
ican people would like to see. 
What this bill would do, their S. 1, 
H.R. 1, would federalize elections. Now, 
many in this Chamber may have served 
on an election commission or been the 
secretary of state in their State, and 
they fully appreciate and understand it 
is the constitutional duty—the con-
stitutional duty—of the States to set 
the time, place, and manner of elec-
tions, and that the voter rolls are 
maintained there in your local county 
by citizens who serve on the election 
commission and who work those polls. 
But this bill that the Democrats are 
wanting to pass would, in essence, do 
away with voter ID. 
Do you know what? Recent polling of 
various and different groups, numerous 
groups, have shown 80 percent of the 
American people really support show-
ing a voter ID, showing an ID in order 
to cast that ballot. Prove that you are 
who you are. Their legislation would 
also institutionalize ballot harvesting, 
something that really offended so 
many thousands of citizens this year 
because with mail-out ballots, which 
they want to institutionalize, some 
people got three, four, five ballots. You 
can go online on social media, see pic-
tures or videos of people holding up 
multiple ballots. That is not election 
integrity. That is not something that 
will ensure trust in the system. That 
would cause more doubt. 
We should agree—we should agree, as 
Members of this Chamber, that we will 
work together to ensure that our local 
and State officials can carry forward 
with their elections. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
now, one of the most important duties 
we take on as Members of this Cham-
ber is the confirmation of the Presi-
dent’s Cabinet and other top executive 
branch issues. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Would my colleague 
yield for a question? 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Not until I finish 
my remarks, but I thank the gen-
tleman. 
A Senate confirmation hearing is 
probably the world’s worst job inter-
view, but there is a good reason for 
that. The various candidates who come 
before our committees are asking to 
take on some of the most important 
challenges that we face as a country. 
And so when the President sends us 
these nominees for consideration, it is 
our job to vet their resumes, to vet 
their records. To go through the mo-
tions is not enough. We need to meet 
with them and review their history. 
So imagine our shock when the Biden 
administration began to send us can-
didates that made it clear the Presi-
dent expects the Senate to act as a 
rubberstamp for some of the most con-
troversial and unqualified nominees in 
recent memory. 
His choice for Health and Human 
Services, Secretary Xavier Becerra, 
had 
no 
meaningful 
experience 
in 
healthcare before his very first day 
serving 
as 
the 
country’s 
chief 
healthcare officer. He did, however, 
have 
quite 
a 
long 
history 
of 
weaponizing the full force of govern-
ment against people whose views differ 
from his own. 
Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s choice 
to lead the Department of Homeland 
Security, boasted a proven record of 
corruption from his time serving in the 
Obama administration. An investiga-
tion by the inspector general for the 
Department of Homeland Security re-
vealed that Mayorkas abused his posi-
tion as the Director of USCIS to help 
politically powerful friends violate im-
migration laws. 
Associate Attorney General Vanita 
Gupta’s record as a radical, liberal ac-
tivist was so diametrically opposed to 
the beliefs of most Americans that she 
tried to ‘‘evolve’’ her positions on drug 
crime and defunding the police just to 
avoid scrutiny during her confirmation 
hearing. Of course, by ‘‘evolve,’’ I mean 
she outright lied about her position. 
And there have been many, many, who 
have stood on this floor and have chal-
lenged her nomination. 
Another, 
David 
Chipman—this 
is 
Biden’s pick to lead the Bureau of Al-
cohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
sives. He is so anti-Second Amend-
ment, he has endorsed policies that 
would effectively ban all sporting rifles 
in the United States. He has no respect 
for the constitutional right to bear 
arms, no respect for the nearly 20 mil-
lion Americans who hold a concealed 
carry permit, or the 15.5 million Ameri-
cans who hold hunting licenses. Presi-
dent Biden chose the anti-gun lobby 
over the American people when he 
nominated Chipman for this post. 
President Biden’s parade of genuinely 
unacceptable nominees continued this 
week. Today, the majority leader has 
decided to move forward with the nom-
ination of Donald Remy to be Deputy 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs. If that 
name sounds familiar to you, it is be-
cause 
you 
have 
heard 
about 
Mr. 
Remy’s work in other controversial 
context. He served as the NCAA’s COO 
and chief legal officer and was the ar-
chitect of that organization’s restric-
tive policy against name, image, and 
likeness compensation. 
Between September 2018 and August 
2019, the NCAA spent more than $26 
million defending an NIL business 
model that the Supreme Court recently 
described as ‘‘patently and inexplicably 
stricter than . . . necessary.’’ It was a 
9-to-0 decision by the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
The $26 million, where does the 
NCAA get that money? From colleges, 
from universities, from student ath-
letes. That is where the money came 
from, and it was used to defend this 
lawsuit. 
But let’s not focus on this one policy 
governing the NIL compensation. We 
need to keep in mind that Mr. Remy 
was comfortable using his training as a 
lawyer and his considerable power as a 
top NCAA official to maintain the cul-
ture of exploitation that defines mod-
ern college athletics. I am not sure 
what led President Biden to believe 
that Mr. Remy could help lead an agen-
cy notorious for its own brand of care-
less exploitation, but whatever the rea-
son, we have a duty to get in his way. 
For our veterans, decisions can be 
life or death. I have objected to his 
nomination since I came through the 
committee. And, quite frankly, I think 
it is a shame that President Biden re-
fused to nominate someone who could 
demonstrate an ability to earn back 
the trust so many veterans have lost in 
the VA system. 
Our veterans who have served this 
Nation 
honorably 
deserve 
better 
choices. They deserve at least that 
much from their Commander in Chief. 
This nomination is just one more 
unserious shot in the dark from an ad-
ministration that is yet to focus its en-
ergy on any one of the long list of prob-
lems they say they came to Wash-
ington to solve. 
A quick scan of the morning news-
letters on any given day show a com-
plete lack of direction on the part of 
the White House and the Senate major-
ity. Will we be working on infrastruc-
ture in the next few weeks or are we 
just going to be handling nominations? 
Are the most radical elements of the 
American Families Plan on the table 
or are we going to pivot to election 
law? Well, we won’t have to flip a coin 
on that last one.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4910 
July 14, 2021 
We know that over the next few 
weeks, we will waste time and energy 
resurrecting 
the 
Democrats’ 
failed 
election takeover bill. As most every-
one has seen, this week, Washington is 
playing host to a delegation of Texas 
Democrats’ intent on holding election 
integrity legislation hostage in their 
very own State. They have come all 
the way to Capitol Hill to try and con-
vince their Federal counterparts to go 
nuclear on behalf of a bill that has 
failed in various forms so many times 
that the objections write themselves. 
This political stunt is part of a larger 
movement within the radical American 
left to destroy the concept of one per-
son, one vote and replace it with an un-
constitutional, 
centralized 
election 
system that invites fraud and encour-
ages donor intimidation. This foolish 
attack on ballot integrity has seized 
hold in Texas, Georgia, and other 
States attempting to protect the vote 
for all eligible voters. 
Ballot integrity is a foundational 
concept in our Republic. It should be 
easy to vote. It should be hard to 
cheat. State and local officials should 
feel empowered to grow and tailor elec-
tions in a way that meets the needs of 
the community, not the demands of 
power-seeking politicians. 
I think I speak for all of my Repub-
lican colleagues when I say that we 
will not legitimize this hysteria that 
has gripped the Democratic Party. In-
stead, we will defend the constitutional 
prerogative of one person, one vote 
through however many objections it 
takes to relegate this scheme that the 
Democrats have been trying for 20 
years to relegate this to the dustbin of 
history. 
I yield the floor.
