PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Holy God, despite the challenges we 
face, You alone are our stronghold. De-
spite the misgivings we have, You 
alone have proven trustworthy. Despite 
the malice we experience, You alone 
offer pure kindness. Despite our own 
wanderings, Your presence with us re-
mains steadfast. 
When measured against Your right-
eousness, none can stand. Our difficul-
ties are woven into Your grace plan. 
Our enemies are thwarted by Your jus-
tice. Our anguish is held captive by 
Your compassion. And our sinfulness is 
redeemed by Your sacrificial love. 
In light of this overwhelming testi-
mony of Your sovereignty, may we face 
all that today brings with the hope of 
Your promises; the courage of Your 
abiding strength; the satisfaction of 
Your sufficient grace, and the delight 
of Your salvation. 
In Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

HAMMONTON: SONS OF ITALY 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, October 
is Italian Heritage Month, a time where we cel-
ebrate the culture and contributions of our 
beautiful 
Italian 
American 
community. 
Hammonton, South Jersey is famous not only 
for their blueberries, but their deep Italian 
roots and heritage too. Recently had the honor 
of attending Hammonton’s annual Columbus 
Day event, where the Sons of Italy recognize 
a local family that has had an impact on the 
community. The Sons of Italy in Hammonton 
do their utmost to preserve the Italian culture, 
heritage, and history that is so special to the 
community. It was a privilege to present them 
with a Congressional Proclamation, in recogni-
tion of their dedication to the Hammonton 
Community, and on such a special day for 
Italian Americans. I thank them for the work 
their organization does, not just for the Italian 
community, but for every Hammontonian. God 
Bless Sons of Italy, and God Bless America.

HONORING MAYOR NICK PROCTOR 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the retirement of a local leader and 
dedicated public servant who I am proud to 
call a friend—the outgoing Mayor of Howell, 
Nick Proctor. 
Mayor Proctor’s ties to Howell stretch back 
to his ancestors when they first set down roots 
in the mid-19th century. First elected to the 
city council in 2013, he’s served as the city’s 
mayor for the last seven. With an agenda fo-
cused on economic vibrancy, he’s been a key 
partner of the Howell Downtown Development 
Authority and the Howell Area Chamber of 
Commerce in the effort to revitalize Michigan 
Avenue. Thanks to his vision of a combination 
of economic development and historic preser-
vation, Howell was honored in 2018 with the 
Great American Main Street Award—a na-
tional recognition for achievements in trans-
forming the downtown district into a cultural 
destination. 
In this era of great challenges and uncer-
tainty, it’s been a comfort to know that Howell 
has had a calm, level-headed mayor with first-
hand experience in crisis management. He’s 
been a champion for every resident of How-
ell—presiding over a city council that unani-
mously approved the first anti-discrimination 
ordinance aimed at protecting LGBT and other 
individuals in Livingston County. 
Last year, when he opted not to seek an-
other term, he reached out via email to all of 
the candidates—both before and after the pri-
mary—making himself available to discuss 
issues confronting the city. And while some 
may see his comity as a bygone relic, Mayor 
Proctor would tell you that collegiality is inte-
gral to who he is. He’s a public servant first, 
committed to the mission at hand. 
He learned this as a former official with the 
Department of State’s Bureau of Diplomatic 
Security. In his role as a security attache´, he 
traveled the world, including stops in Ger-
many, Sri Lanka, Jordan, and Japan. Later on, 
he served as Head of Global Security for Brit-
ish American Tobacco, based out of London. 
Needless to say, Mayor Proctor has seen the 
world and brought back a unique perspective 
to the good folks of Howell. 
His ability to see things from different points 
of view is one of his greatest skills, and I ap-
preciate his words as Congress has worked to 
pass an infrastructure bill. Last month, he was 
quoted as saying: ‘‘Infrastructure has no polit-
ical affiliation. We need to come together to 
serve the people.’’ 
It’s a message that folks in Washington 
would do well to heed—we were sent here to 
put our constituents first, just like Mayor Proc-
tor has for the better part of a decade. I’ll miss 
working with him—particularly given our back-
grounds in national security—but I know he’s 
earned a relaxing retirement filled with occa-
sional travel, a good book, and watching the 
latest ice hockey or college football game. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful 
community, it’s my privilege to honor Mayor 
Nick Proctor so that my colleagues in the Peo-
ple’s House may know that Mayor Nick Proc-
tor made a difference.

MAINTAINING U.S. ECONOMIC 
COMPETITIVENESS 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak about the importance of economic com-
petitiveness. 
This is an economic issue that the President 
has prioritized in his efforts to build back bet-
ter, recognizing that promoting competition 
can lower prices for families, increase wages 
for workers, and promote innovation and even 
faster economic growth. On July 9, 2021, 
President Biden issued an Executive Order on 
‘‘Promoting Competition in the American Econ-
omy,’’ which stressed the importance of a re-
silient economy that incorporates a fair, open, 
and competitive marketplace, and warned 
against excessive market concentration which 
threatens basic economic liberties, democratic 
accountability, and the welfare of workers, 
farmers, small businesses, startups, and con-
sumers. 
In the Joint Economic Committee, which I 
chair, we held a hearing earlier this year on 
corporate power, specifically on the rise and 
concentration of corporate market power in the 
United States and how it harms consumers, 
workers, and small businesses. In that hear-
ing, we found that as business concentration 
has increased in the United States, the rise of 
concentrated corporate market power in the 
U.S. is associated with weak investment rates, 
lower productivity growth, and higher prices. 
Indeed, firms invest less per dollar of profit 
today now than they did in the second half of 
the 20th century, making labor less productive 
and suppressing wages. 
Congress over the years has acted to pro-
mote competition, including legislation like the 
Lanham Act to regulate the registration and 
use of trademarks and protect from unfair 
competition. Further, the Lanham Act provides 
federal judicial protection against infringement 
for trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office. Specifically, the law 
provides federal causes of action for trade-
mark dilution and several unfair competition 
claims, such as unregistered trademark in-
fringement, false advertising, false endorse-
ment, and false designation of origin. 
I am concerned by cases where domestic, 
foreign, or multinational corporations are using 
the Lanham Act to suppress or restrict com-
petition within the United States, particularly 
with small businesses. It is especially disheart-
ening when those goods or services are dedi-
cated to the health and safety of minority com-
munities, where the impact of these cases will 
be felt most. 
Our economy has traditionally been a pow-
erful engine for innovation that has provided 
unmatched prosperity to millions. However, 
unprecedented corporate concentration and 
anticompetitive practices are preventing us 
from reaching our economic potential. I urge 
my colleagues to champion the Biden agenda 
for economic competitiveness and take steps 
to tackle pernicious behavior.

IN RECOGNITION OF HASSAN 
JABER 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to 
recognize the numerous outstanding contribu-
tions of Hassan Jaber to the communities of 
Wayne County, Michigan, as he retires after 
more than 40 years of service from ACCESS. 
During his four decades at ACCESS, Has-
san Jaber has been instrumental in shep-
herding its growth and expansion. He has 
been a leader in expanding ACCESS’ pro-
gramming to include more than one hundred 
platforms and ten locations to assist residents 
across Wayne County and southeastern Michi-
gan. Hassan Jaber created partnerships lo-
cally and nationally to advocate for policy ini-
tiatives to fight bigotry, advance civil rights, 
and to create a better quality of life for immi-
grant and other vulnerable populations through

access to human services. With every obsta-
cle, he never wavered in leading with compas-
sion and keeping the community at the center 
of the work. 
Hassan Jaber’s leadership and forward- 
thinking approach have solidified his legacy as 
a community leader. In addition to his im-
mense positive impact on the communities of 
Wayne County, he also served on many na-
tional and community boards, including the 
U.S. Census National Community Advisory 
Board on Race and Ethnicity and the Michigan 
Census Complete Count Committee; United 
Way for Southeastern Michigan; the Detroit In-
stitute of Arts; and the Detroit Zoological Soci-
ety. I had the honor of working with him for 
years and his mentorship helped me grow into 
a passionate advocate for my district. 
Please join me in recognizing Hassan 
Jaber’s work on behalf of residents of Michi-
gan’s 13th district and southeastern Michigan 
as we wish him well on the next chapter in his 
life.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
LIEUTENANT DALE EDWARDS 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding service of Lieu-
tenant Dale Edwards, a beloved community 
leader and police officer in York, South Caro-
lina. 
Lt. Edwards has dedicated over two dec-
ades of his life to serving our community. As 
York’s community officer, Lt. Edwards is re-
sponsible for attending local events, orga-
nizing the Thanksgiving and Christmas meal 
drives and holiday gift drive, and training other 
officers. He has spent his career forging 
meaningful relationships with our community. 
As a testament to his commitment to service, 
Lt. Edwards has celebrated numerous Thanks-
giving and Christmas holidays by handing out 
$100 bills and turkeys to needy community 
members from his patrol car. He also regularly 
volunteers at Tender Hearts and works with 
local volunteers to collect donations for gifts, 
toys, and clothes to distribute. 
Lt. Edwards consistently goes above and 
beyond the call of duty. ln September of 2021, 
Lt. Edwards helped save the life of a fellow 
community member. During a morning service 
at Liberty Church, Glenn Raybon collapsed 
and suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Two reg-
istered nurses, Kelly Stewart and Reeanna 
Hinkle, jumped into action and began admin-
istering CPR. Lt. Edwards retrieved the auto-
mated external defibrillator and courageously 
delivered a shock to Mr. Raybon, who was 
able to begin breathing on his own and re-
gained a palpable pulse. Mr. Raybon made a 
full recovery and was back in church three 
weeks later. 
More recently, Lt. Edwards and his wife 
Robin organized a welcome home parade for 
a young woman named Maggie who left the 
hospital after a lengthy battle with COVID–19. 
On short notice, Lt. Edwards assembled a fire 
truck, three police cars, and more than twenty 
vehicles of community members to ride by and 
see Maggie’s smiling face. The parade was a 
deeply moving experience for everyone in-
volved. 
These stories are not outliers for a day in 
the life of Lt. Edwards. His sense of service 
and selflessness is above reproach, leading 
him to earn the respect of law enforcement 
and citizens all over the state. In the words of 
Mayor Mike Fuesser, Lt. Edwards ‘‘is a true 
asset to the force and community.’’ Others 
have described Lt. Edwards as a ‘‘miracle 
from the Lord.’’ His career is a testament to all 
the good our men and women in blue do for 
our cities. On behalf of the 5th District of 
South Carolina, I thank Lt. Edwards for his 
continued sacrifice and service. York is truly 
blessed to have him as a community guardian.

NEWCOMB SENIOR APARTMENTS 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, Vineland, 
New Jersey’s Planning Board approved a $17 
million project which will benefit the senior 
community in Cumberland. Our seniors are 
the bedrock of our communities, not only in 
South Jersey, but the entire nation. It is nec-
essary that we care and protect them, just as 
they did for us. Developer, Hans Lampart, and 
the Vineland Planning Board are doing just 
that with their redevelopment project. Their 
project will give seniors the opportunity to live 
independently and affordably in high-rise style 
apartments. On behalf of the senior commu-
nity, I thank Hans, and wish him good luck as 
he moves forward with this project. God Bless 
Newcomb Senior Apartments, and God Bless 
America.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
COMPLETION 
OF THE FIRST KOREAN WAR ME-
MORIAL 
MONUMENT 
BUILT 
IN 
THE CITY OF FULLERTON 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and venerate the more than 54,000 
American lives lost during the Korean War. 
The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, 
when North Korean soldiers crossed the 38th 
parallel and invaded South Korea. The vio-
lence immediately drew international attention, 
and on June 27, 1950, President Harry S. Tru-
man ordered United States air, sea, and 
ground forces to assist the Republic of Korea. 
All Americans owe a debt of gratitude to our 
nation’s soldiers, ground troops, sailors, air-
men, coast guards, and marines who fought 
and died defending the world’s model of free-
dom, democracy, and justice. 
In that vein, Koreans and Korean Americans 
have led a major effort to design, construct, 
and oversee a monument that recognizes the 
extraordinary bravery of those American serv-
ice members who lost their lives during the 
Korean War. 
Led by the Orange County Korean War Me-
morial Committee, of which I am a member, 
the historic Korean War Memorial Monument 
will be dedicated November 11, 2021, on 
America’s Veterans Day. Located in the north-
ern part of Hillcrest Park, adjacent to the Duck 
Pond, the monument will be the first in Amer-
ica to feature the inscribed names of all 
36,591 soldiers who made the ultimate sac-
rifice while serving on the Korean Peninsula, 
2,612 of whom were Californians. 
Through this effort, there will be ongoing 
dialogue about the Korean War’s historical sig-
nificance, while promoting awareness and re-
minding the public of the noble sacrifice made 
by America’s fallen veterans. 
Please join me in commending the work and 
dedication of the volunteers and officials from 
various agencies who helped turn the dream 
of a Korean War Memorial into reality. By 
doing so, a permanent monument now stands 
to honor the 36,591 fallen heroes who so val-
iantly gave their lives to protect freedom.

COMMITMENT TO HAMILTON 
COUNTY VETERANS 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA

Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the 13,301 Veteran residents of Ham-
ilton County, Indiana, in collaboration with 
state and local officials of the county and sub-
mit the following for the record: 
Whereas, Hamilton County is proud to be 
home to 13,301 Veterans; and 
Whereas, we continue to build, encourage, 
and connect resources and systems of care 
that empower Veterans to live their best lives 
and realize their full potential within our com-
munity; and 
Whereas, Hamilton County, in collaboration 
with our residents and partners, is committed 
to the health and well-being of the men and 
women who have served our country; and 
Whereas, since 2005 the rate of suicide in 
Hamilton County among Veterans was 32.0 
per 100,000, compared with 17.2 per 100,000 
for nonveterans; and 
Whereas, we remain concerned about the 
number of veterans that we have lost to sui-
cide; and 
Whereas, we recognize the challenges 
when transitioning from active-duty status, un-
derstand Veteran assistance is a constant 
community effort, and the need to assist Vet-
erans in navigating those resources that the 
Hamilton County community provides is con-
tinually addressed. 
Whereas, we commit to engage in commu-
nity efforts and collaborate with partners like 
the United States Department of Veterans Af-
fairs, the Indiana Department of Veteran Af-
fairs, Hamilton County Health Department, the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Le-
gion, community mental health centers, and 
our business and non-profit community mem-
bers to create effective solutions to reduce 
Veteran suicide within our community. 
Whereas, we are committed to creating a 
welcoming community where our returning 
Veterans can live, work, and thrive with ready 
access to the care they need when they need 
it. 
As Indiana’s Fifth Congressional District 
Representative, I proclaim our community’s 
appreciation of our Veterans, and our pledge 
to help save veteran lives.

HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL 
JEFFERSON 
D. 
REYNOLDS 
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, RE-
TIRED 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to honor and rec-
ognize Lt. Col., Ret. Jefferson D. Reynolds as 
the 2021 recipient of the inaugural Veteran of 
the Year Award for the Fourth Congressional 
District of Virginia. 
Lt. Col., Ret. Reynolds has dedicated his life 
to serving our country, both as an enlisted sol-
dier in the United States Army and as a Lieu-
tenant Colonel in the United States Air Force 
in the Judge Advocate General Corps. Lt. 
Col., Ret. Reynolds currently works as an at-
torney for the Virginia Department of Environ-
mental Quality providing program oversight 
and enforcement for over 50 agency program 
areas including air, water, waste, remediation, 
wetlands, petroleum, and natural resource 
damage. 
For his service, Lt. Col., Ret. Reynolds has 
earned numerous awards, including the de-
fense meritorious service medal, two meri-
torious service medals, and numerous com-
mendation medals. He is a veteran of both 
Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation 
Iraqi Freedom, as well as Operation Joint 
Forge in Bosnia. 
In addition to our appreciation for his serv-
ice, we owe Lt. Col., Ret. Reynolds a debt of 
gratitude for the work he does for communities 
in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Lt. Col., Ret. 
Reynolds serves as an Emergency Medical 
Technician squad leader for the Tuckahoe 
Volunteer Rescue Squad and as a member of 
the Virginia Medical Reserve Corps. He con-
tinues to volunteer his time in the Richmond 
area focusing on medical education for at-risk 
veterans. 
Lt. Col., Ret. Reynolds personal connection 
to rock climbing at the age of 14 has inspired 
him to create a mountaineering company that 
has organized and led expeditions to every 
continent in the world. He has climbed the 
highest peaks of the seven continents and 
with every climb undertaken it strengthens his 
resolve to advocate for the preservation and 
protection of our mountain landscapes. Lt. 
Col., Ret. Reynolds is also the proud father of 
two children, who, according to him: ‘‘are, un-
doubtedly, my biggest adventure.’’ 
It is for these reasons and so many more 
that I am proud to recognize Lt. Col., Rel. Jef-
ferson D. Reynolds as the 2021 recipient of 
the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia’s 
inaugural Veteran of the Year Award for his 
continued service to our Commonwealth and 
our country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Lt. Col., Ret. Reynolds for 
his devotion to the United States of America 
and his selfless efforts to help all those around 
him improve the environment. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE PAUL LAU-
RENCE 
DUNBAR 
COMMEMORA-
TIVE COIN ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Paul Laurence Dunbar Com-
memorative Coin Act. This bill recognizes one 
of the first influential African-American poets in 
American literature and benefits the Dunbar 
Alumni Federation, the alumni association for 
the Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School 
in the District of Columbia, which is historic for 
being the first public high school for African 
Americans in the United States. I myself am a 
proud graduate of Dunbar, a storied African- 
American high school in our country. 
Paul Laurence Dunbar was born on June 
27, 1872, to freed slaves, and went on to pen 
such classics as Majors and Minors and Lyrics 
of Lowly Life. He also composed the lyrics to 
In Dahomey, the first all-African-American mu-
sical produced on Broadway. By the late 
1890s, Dunbar had become a prominent au-
thor, having had his poems published in major 
national newspapers, including The New York 
Times. Dunbar died on February 9, 1906, at 
age 33. 
Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School 
was established in 1870 as the Preparatory 
High School for Colored Youth. It was the first 
college preparatory high school for African- 
American children in the United States. The 
school was renamed for Dunbar in 1916. 
The Dunbar Alumni Federation was orga-
nized in 2002 to provide scholarships and 
other financial support to students and grad-
uates of Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High 
School. The Federation has alumni from more 
than 35 graduating classes, and supports the 
school through its scholarship efforts, commu-
nity activities and other endeavors. 
This bill authorizes the Secretary of the 
Treasury to mint 50,000 five-dollar coins, 
400,000 one-dollar coins and 750,000 half-dol-
lar coins, with a surcharge on each coin. The 
surcharges will benefit the scholarships and 
similar activities of the Dunbar Alumni Federa-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill.

RECOGNIZING JUANITA BATTLE 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, please 
recognize a dedicated and strong advocate for 
those who have been affected by domestic vi-
olence and sexual abuse. Juanita Battle of 
West Cape May passed away on October 7, 
2021. She was a hero to many, and her leg-
acy will live on with all of those who had the 
pleasure of knowing her. Juanita was the 
proud founder of Cape May County’s Coalition 
Against Rape and Abuse. Her Coalition pro-
vides counsel, support, and advocates for vic-
tims and survivors of domestic violence and 
sexual assault. She touched the hearts of 
many thousands of people during her forty- 
seven years of service, and she will live on in 
their hearts forever. Juanita truly was a pillar 
of strength in the Cape May Community and 
may she rest in peace. God Bless Juanita, 
and God Bless America.

TRIBUTE TO VETERANS OF THE 
ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED 
STATES 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to pay tribute to all the men and women who 
have served in the Armed Forces of the 
United States and risked their lives to defend 
our freedoms and way of life and took and 
lived the oath to ‘‘support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States against all en-
emies, foreign and domestic’’ and bore true 
faith and allegiance to the same, an obligation 
they took freely, without any mental reserva-
tion or purpose of evasion.’’ 
Veterans are truly heroes walking among 
us. 
I want to thank all of our armed serviceman 
and women for their selfless dedication to our 
protection every day. 
Veterans Day is a reminder to all of us who 
live in freedom that as President Kennedy 
said, ‘‘The price of freedom is high, but Ameri-
cans have always paid it.’’ 
This Veterans Day is a welcome opportunity 
to remember that the fallen who gave the last 
full measure of devotion to their country on 
battlefields around the world—in places whose 
names may be unforgettable—or locations that 
have slipped into the pages of history. 
We will never forget: 
Revolutionary War: 
Valley Forge 
York Town 
Civil War: 
The Battle of Antietam 
The Battle of Gettysburg 
World War I: 
The Battle of Argonne 
Flanders Field 
Verdun 
World War II: 
Pearl Harbor 
Battle of Bataan 
The Battle of Midway 
D-Day 
Battle of the Bulge

have served our country around the world in 
the name of freedom and democracy. 
The debt that we owe to them is immeas-
urable. 
Their sacrifices, and those of their families, 
are freedom’s foundation. 
Without the brave efforts of all the soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guards-
men and women and their families, our coun-
try would not live so freely. 
I offer my deepest gratitude to our nation’s 
troops and reservists, their families, and the 
21.6 million veterans, including 29,126 here in 
the 18th Congressional District. 
21.6 million brave men and women are vet-
erans of our nation’s military service. 
This includes more than 2 million women, 
2.7 million African American men and women, 
1.5 million Hispanic men and women, 342,000 
Asian American Pacific Islanders, and 178,000 
American Indians. 
Nine in ten military families believe the pub-
lic does not understand or appreciate their 
sacrifices. 
We use Veterans Day to show our veterans 
and military families how important they are to 
us and how grateful we are for them each and 
every day. 
November is National Caregivers Month to 
show our caregivers how grateful we are for 
them. 
It is only fitting that we thank those care-
givers who serve our military today. 
5.5 million spouses, parents, children, and 
other loved ones care for our wounded war-
riors and 15 percent of caregivers spend 40- 
plus hours a week providing care for our mili-
tary families. 
As a senior member of the House Commit-
tees on Judiciary and Homeland Security, I 
care deeply about our veterans. 
In Congress, I have sponsored many legis-
lative proposals and co-sponsored more than 
50 pieces of legislation that will positively ben-
efit our veterans and their families. 
On the battlefield, the military pledges to 
leave no soldier behind. 
As a nation, let it be our pledge that when 
they return home, we leave no veteran behind. 
This day and every day let us honor their 
service with actions that fulfill our commitment 
to our troops, their families, and our vet-
erans—and that are worthy of our grateful na-
tion.

HONORING MICHIGAN STATE UNI-
VERSITY’S VICTORY OVER THE 
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a team that has electrified the East 
Lansing community with its accomplishments 
both on and off the field—the 2021 Michigan 
State University football team. 
Under the leadership of Coach Mel Tucker, 
the Spartans’ motto is ‘‘relentless.’’ The word 
is stamped on the back of the players’ helmets 
and it’s present in everything the players do. 
Since the first offseason conditioning practice, 
the players have had an energy drilled into 
them that has translated to an undefeated 
season with four games left to play. Today, 
MSU is the fifth-ranked team in the nation be-
cause of what Coach Tucker calls the ‘‘deep 
water.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the deep water is a place 
that you don’t want to be in. The deep water 
is cold, dark, and disorienting. For the MSU 
football team, their success lies in their ability 
to take their opponents to the deep water—to 
outlast them both physically and mentally. 
As a result, this Spartan team has been 
defying the odds and the naysayers. And after 
last Saturday’s comeback victory against the 
University of Michigan, it’s clear that this team 
has what it takes to go all the way. 
Heisman-favorite Kenneth Walker III put on 
a clinic, scoring all five touchdowns and notch-
ing 191 rushing yards—101 of them in the 
fourth quarter alone. Quarterback Payton 
Thorne and wide receiver Jayden Reed, team-
mates who have been playing together since 
middle school, connected on a two-point con-
version late in the game to complete a 16- 
point comeback. And on defense, everyone 
from linebacker Simeon Barrow to freshman 
cornerback Chuck Brantley personified the 
idea of ‘‘bend, don’t break’’ as they came up 
with clutch plays time and time again. It’s be-
cause of their relentless efforts, and the efforts 
of every member of the roster, that the Paul 
Bunyan trophy is staying home with the Sparty 
faithful. 
From campus to Congress, the MSU–UM ri-
valry is an example of how good old fashioned 
competition can bring out the best in us. To 
that end, I want to thank my dear friend Rep-
resentative DINGELL for being a good sport 
and rallying the alumni as part of our prank 
war last week. 
In closing, Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the Michigan State fight song, ‘‘Vic-
tory for MSU’’. And today, tomorrow, and for-
ever: Go Green. 
On the banks of the Red Cedar, 
There’s a school that’s known to all; 
Its specialty is winning, 
And those Spartans play good ball; 
Spartan teams are never beaten, 
All through the game they fight; 
Fight for the only colors: 
Green and White. 
Smash right through that line of blue, 
Watch the points keep growing, 
Spartan teams are bound to win, 
They’re fighting with a vim! 
Rah! Rah! Rah! 
Michigan is weakening, 
We’re going to win this game, 
Fight! Fight! Rah! Team, Fight! 
Victory for MSU

HONORING VETERAN CHUCK 
HABERMAN 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight a veteran constituent of mine, 
Chuck Haberman, of Noblesville, Indiana. 
Chuck served in the United States Marine 
Corps from 2007 until 2014. 
Upon his return to Indiana, Chuck imme-
diately redeployed his leadership skills to 
strengthen his community in Hamilton County. 
Following several years in the private sec-
tor, last year Chuck moved into the role of 
Workforce Development Manager for the City 
of Noblesville, working with educators, train-
ers, and business leaders. He is also a Trust-
ee of Ivy Tech Community College Hamilton 
County and Member of the Board of the 
Noblesville Chamber of Commerce. 
Chuck has also convened the Hamilton 
County 21st Century Veterans Committee 
which highlights resources and support op-
tions for veterans and their families in Central 
Indiana, a critical need at this time in our na-
tion’s history. 
I thank Chuck for his continued service to 
our nation’s veterans and the Fifth Congres-
sional District.

Eric Thomas and his team at Sunshine Den-
tistry have been serving the residents of Cape 
May County with cutting edge dentistry for a 
long time. They consistently provide quality 
and expert care for the residents of Cape May 
County. As a dentist, a visit to the dentist is 
not necessarily fun. However, Doctor Thomas 
and his team have mastered the formula for 
providing a pleasant and comfortable experi-
ence for their patients. Their passion for their 
profession and dedication to their patients 
have not gone unnoticed. Congratulations to 
Eric on the new location, and best of luck al-

HONORING FITZGERALD 
BARRINGTON DAVIS 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor the life of Fitzgerald Barrington Davis, 
who passed away peacefully on November 1, 
2021, at the age of 77 after a long and coura-
geous battle with Parkinson’s disease demen-
tia. He was surrounded by his loved ones at 
the time of his passing and they will continue 
to honor his legacy of faith, unconditional love, 
and kindness. His son Dave Davis was a val-
ued member of my district office team for 
many years. 
Fitzgerald was born in Jamaica on May 15, 
1944, to Barrington and Gwendolyn Davis. He 
attended Saint Ann Technical Trade School to 
pursue his interest in building, design, and 
construction. As a contractor for the Roads 
and Works Department in Kingston, Jamaica 
he oversaw the development of critical infra-
structure projects in and around the Kingston 
area. 
Fitzgerald understood that his job was more 
than just repairing roads and buildings and 
that these investments in infrastructure could 
benefit underserved families through commu-
nity development and jobs. He created pro-
grams to help young people learn trades and 
develop their skills and subsequently em-
ployed many of these young people and pro-
vided them with opportunities for growth,

which improved the quality of life ’for residents 
and strengthened his community. 
His advocacy for underserved populations 
led him to a career in politics, and he was 
nominated chairman for the People’s National 
Party in Jamaica. During his time as chairman, 
he worked with government leaders to im-
prove conditions for children and families in 
Kingston. He was also enlisted as the youth 
leader for the Rennock Lodge Youth Organi-
zation. 
He emigrated to the United States in Janu-
ary of 1981 and settled in the diverse Rogers 
Park neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois with his 
wife and five children. His first job was with St. 
Francis Hospital in Evanston, followed by a 
position with a tuckpointing company, and fi-
nally, he worked for the Village of Glencoe for 
16 years where he retired in 2006. 
After retirement, he continued to serve his 
community as a volunteer for numerous non-
profit organizations. He was actively involved 
with the Democratic Party of Evanston and 
worked as a crossing guard for the City of 
Evanston. Each morning, he woke up looking 
forward to seeing the children and brightening 
up their days with words of encouragement or 
a witty quip that made them smile. 
His faith was the driving force in his life, and 
he was an elder at First Church of God Chris-
tian Life Center in Evanston, and then became 
an Elder at Deliverance Temple Church in 
Skokie. 
Fitzgerald is survived by his devoted wife of 
49 years, Sonia Davis; daughters, Rose Scott 
and Karen Davis; sons, Byron Davis (Marie), 
Lloyd Davis (Loraine), Dave Davis (Tara); 
grandchildren, Klarissa Davis, Lloyd Davis Jr., 
Kayla Davis, Leah Davis, Theo Davis, and 
Steven Davis; and great-grandchildren, Ivy 
and Oakley. Fitzgerald also leaves behind 
brothers Philip Davis and Chris Davis; sisters 
Deloris Scott, Beverly Burnett, Angela Davis, 
and a host of other loving relatives and friends 
who will rejoice in his memory.

GENERAL 
RAY-

AND BRAVE MILITARY LEADER 
FOR OVER FOUR DECADES 
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize General Raymond Thomas Odierno, 
former Chief of Staff for the Army and a native 
of Rockaway in New Jersey’s 11th Congres-
sional District, General Odierno began his 
service to our country as a young man attend-
ing the United States Military Academy at 
West Point and went on to serve our nation 
for the majority of his life. 
He was commissioned as an officer in the 
Army in 1976, serving around the world to pro-
tect and defend our nation’s Constitution and 
values. Most notably, General Odierno served 
three tours in Iraq, including commanding the 
4th Infantry Division on his first tour in 2003, 
which played a major role in the capture of 
Saddam Hussein. 
In 2011, General Odierno was selected to 
be the Army’s Chief of Staff, the highest rank-
ing general in the Army. In this role, he guided 
the Army through the final withdrawal of troops 
from Iraq, addressed issues facing our troops 
including rising rates of suicide, and handled 
crises such as the Ebola outbreak in 2014. 
General Odierno’s strength, strategic think-
ing, and commitment to service were un-
matched and our country is safer because of 
him. He was a beloved community member of 
NJ–11. Whenever he returned to his home-
town in Morris County, he gave back to the 
local community, including by meeting with the 
next generation of leaders at the local schools. 
General Odierno passed away on October 
8th after a valiant battle with cancer. He will 
be missed by his family, friends, the NJ–11 
community, and fellow servicemembers and 
veterans.

IN HONOR OF WALTER COX 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
a great American, Walter Clay Cox, Jr. Mr. 
Cox was born on November 9, 1922 and lives 
in Lexington, Kentucky. Mr. Cox celebrates his 
99th birthday this year. 
Mr. Cox grew up in Lancaster, Kentucky. 
After graduating from high school in 1940, he 
attended the University of Kentucky. He was 
headed to law school when his ROTC unit 
was called up for basic training in 1943. He 
was later assigned to the U.S. Army’s 3rd pla-
toon, 70th Infantry Division. The troops were 
shipped out of Boston to Marseille, France. 
The platoon of 40 men left for the front lines 
on December 10, 1944, traveling in a boxcar. 
They arrived at the front in time for a ‘‘real’’ 
Christmas. Conditions were brutal in the freez-
ing winter as the unit fought the German army 
in the Battle of the Bulge. Mr. Cox attained the 
rank of Captain. He remembers well the cele-
bration when the Germans surrendered in 
1945. Mr. Cox’s service continued during the 
occupation of Germany until May of 1946. He 
was recalled to active duty and served in the 
Judge Advocate General Corps in Korea from 
January 1951 to September 1952. 
In 1946, Mr. Cox returned to the University 
of Kentucky and completed his Juris Doc-
torate. He served as the Police Judge in Lan-
caster. He was the originating and managing 
partner of a law practice in Lexington. For 
more than 50 years, he has been a member 
of the Commercial Law League of America, 
the Kentucky Bar Association Senior Coun-
selor, Federal Bar authorized to practice be-
fore the Supreme Court and authorized to 
practice before the US Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. He opened his own law practice 
in 2004 and continues to actively practice law. 
Mr. Cox authored a book, ‘‘I Love My Angel’’, 
about his service in the military. 
Walter Cox is a true patriot, a great Amer-
ican, and an inspiration to us all. I am forever 
grateful to him and other members of the 
Greatest Generation or sacrificing and fighting 
to preserve the freedoms that we hold dear. It 
is my honor to recognize him on his 99th birth-
day before the United States Congress.

ARIZONA MARINE PREVENTS 
ROBBERY 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA

Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and commend Marine veteran 
James Kilcer, whose exceptional heroism and 
extraordinary courage prevented an armed 
robbery at a Yuma, Arizona convenience 
store. 
On October 20, three men, one of whom 
was armed, entered the convenience store 
where Mr. Kilcer was shopping. Acting without 
hesitation, Mr. Kilcer disarmed the gunman 
and detained him until police arrived. 
Because of his heroism and swift action, no 
one was hurt and the robbers were all ar-
rested. James Kilcer is well-deserving of the 
Citizen’s Valor Award recently presented to 
him by the Yuma Sheriff Department. Madam 
Speaker, I commend Mr. James Kilcer for put-
ting his own life on the line while aiding his fel-
low citizens.

HONORING MANUELA RENDON 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
Manuela Rendon, a dedicated leader in South 
Texas who has given 50 years of service to 
Head Start programs and has made a lasting 
impact on thousands of children and families 
in our community. 
Ms. Rendon’s advocacy journey began in 
1971 during her time as a teacher at Bonita 
Park Head Start program in Harlingen, Texas. 
During her first year as an educator, she de-
veloped a passion for Head Start and com-
mitted herself to helping underserved families. 
Ms. Rendon was quickly promoted to center

Start initiative for Cameron and Willacy Coun-
ties Community Projects (CWCCP). There, 
she continued her work on behalf of South 
Texas youth and families, and collaborated 
with the Policy Council, Board of Directors, 
and other staff members to carry out the Head 
Start mission. With the belief that there is 
strength in numbers, Ms. Rendon made the 
pivotal decision to work with community lead-
ers to create a network of support for children 
and families. 
As CWCCP’s Head Start Director, Ms. 
Rendon became dissatisfied by the lack of re-
sources available to Head Start parents. Ms. 
Rendon faced this challenge with purpose and 
determination; and worked to reform the pro-
gram and champion a new initiative. In 1989, 
with the support of Head Start parents and 
other community leaders, Ms. Rendon estab-
lished the non-profit organization Neighbors In 
Need of Services, Inc. (NINOS). The purpose 
of NINOS was to advocate for the Head Start 
program in Cameron and Willacy counties, 
and it quickly succeeded. 
NINOS was awarded a Head Start grant in 
1990 and has continued to successfully se-
cure funding for programming to support local 
families. The program, which initially served a 
few hundred children, now serves over 2,400 
Head Start and Early Head Start families; and 
provides a wide range of services including 
health and nutritional assessments, medical 
and dental follow-ups, individualized ‘‘school 
readiness,’’ nutritional meals and snacks, and 
pre- and post-natal education for pregnant 
women. 
Ms. Rendon is the driving force behind the 
success of NINOS—she has created a quality 
program that is nationally recognized by the 
Head Start community by focusing not only on 
early childhood education, but also on parent 
involvement. She has even provided parents 
with opportunities to travel and advocate for 
Head Start in Texas and across the country. 
Ms. Rendon’s commitment to Texas families 
began with Head Start in Harlingen, but her in-
fluence goes far beyond that. She has served 
on and chaired many boards and committees 
including the Region VI Head Start Associa-
tion, Texas Head Start Association Board of 
Directors, Texas Department of Human Serv-
ices 
Licensing 
Advisory 
Council, 
State 
Colonias Advisory Committee, and Texas 
Southmost College Early Childhood Advisory 
Council. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Manuela Rendon, who after 
50 years of service continues to be a voice for 
those in need, and whose dedication to 
bettering the lives of children strengthens the 
health and prosperity of South Texas families.

CONGRATULATING SOUTH 
MILLVILLE GUN CLUB 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, in 1946, 
the South Millville Gun Club was founded in 
South Jersey. For the past 75 years, the club 
has served as a place for its members and 
their families to gather, hunt, celebrate, and 
enjoy the outdoors. The South Millville Gun 
Club has been a member of the New Jersey 
Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs since 1959 
and an esteemed NRA member since 1969. 
This club has been a significant part of the 
South Jersey community for almost four dec-
ades. The club hosts various events like their 
Super Bowl Wing and Rib Sale and their fa-
mous Ham and Oyster Dinner. Congratula-
tions to the South Millville Gun Club on their 
recent proclamation, which recognizes the 
past 75 years, and the next 75 years to come. 
God Bless the South Millville Gun Club, and 
God Bless America.

HONORING VICTORIA BARRIOS 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Victoria Barrios. While her life was 
cut short by a senseless drive-by shooting, 
Victoria Barrios lived her 18 years as a loving 
daughter, sister, and faithful friend. 
Born November 4, 2000, Victoria was a 
bright, kind-hearted, well-spoken young lady 
with an infectious laugh and a soft heart for el-
derly people. At only 5 feet tall and 90 
pounds, she was courageous and stood up for 
anyone who she felt was being disrespected, 
shamed or bullied. 
Now gone for two years, her family con-
tinues to search for those responsible for end-
ing Victoria’s life. 
I pray there is justice for Victoria and her 
family.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE ROCK OF 
AGES 
MISSIONARY 
BAPTIST 
CHURCH 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
tribute to Rock of Ages Missionary Baptist 
Church, a house of worship in Detroit, Michi-
gan, as its members celebrate the church’s fif-
tieth anniversary, as well as fifty years under 
the leadership of Pastor Jerome R. McAfee. 
The church began in the humble home of 
Pastor and Sister Jerome McAfee. Starting 
with a small congregation of fourteen worship-
pers, the church has moved several times 
throughout the city of Detroit. Worshippers 
have found solace from Gratiot Street to Van 
Dyke, eventually growing large enough and 
moving to their current place of worship on 
Evergreen street. The church has continued to 
be inspired by the singular goal of spreading 
the gospel, and they have structured several 
ministries allowing their members to serve and 
carry out the mission of the church. 
Rock of Ages Missionary Baptist Church 
has enriched the lives of so many—whether 
that be the members of the congregation or 
the recipients of their volunteer work, the 
church has been an important part of the com-
munity. As the church continues to grow into 
the future, it will remain a welcoming environ-
ment full of prayer, praise, fellowship, and mu-
tual aid, where every person is a valued mem-
ber of a beautiful community. This legacy lives 
on in the inspiring longevity of Pastor McAfees 
service. 
Please join me in tribute to Pastor Jerome 
R. McAfee and the members of Rock of Ages 
Missionary Baptist Church as we recognize its 
fiftieth anniversary.

RECOGNIZING NICHOLAS CRIPPS— 
EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the pleasure of presenting Nick 
Cripps with his Eagle Scout Court of Honor. 
Nick was born and raised in Wildwood, South 
Jersey with his parents and two siblings. While 
playing youth sports, he became a Webelos at 
Glenwood Avenue Elementary School. Once 
Nick became of eligible age, he joined Boy 
Scout Troop 75 and eventually obtained his 
Eagle Scout. For his Eagle Scout project, he 
sand blasted and power washed the 4,200 
square foot ceiling of the fire house engine 
room of the Wildwood Fire Department Head-
quarters. For this project, Nick demonstrated 
leadership by serving as the project manager. 
His project made the fire engine room safer 
for everyone who walks through the fire 
house. This young man should be proud of his 
accomplishments and it was my honor to have 
had the opportunity to recognize him for his 
service to the South Jersey community. God 
Bless Nick, and God Bless America.

HONORING VETERAN EMILY 
QUILLEN 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight a veteran constituent of mine, 
Emily Quillen of Anderson, Indiana. Emily is a 
Supportive Services for Veteran Families 
(SSVF) peer mentor at Aspire Indiana. 
As a veteran of the United States Army, 
Emily understands the difficulty of finding the 
necessary resources when returning home 
after service in the Armed Forces. In her cur-
rent role, she connects veterans with available 
housing and assists them with needs like 
transportation, child care support, and the 
search for full-time employment. 
I thank Emily for her continued service to 
our nation’s veterans and Indiana’s Fifth Con-
gressional District.

Alyssa Sullivan, the current Miss New Jersey, 
will be competing in the Miss America 2021 
competition. Alyssa is a lifelong resident of 
Cape May County Court House and graduated 
from Rowan University in 2021. Alyssa cur-
rently works in the news industry at PHL17. 
Her social impact initiative, Peer Challenge 
Commit 2 Character, educates teenagers on 
the dangers of risk-taking behaviors and their 
ability to derail their futures. She speaks to 
young people about how to lead a healthy life-
style surrounded by positivity and people who 
raise them higher. Alyssa should be incredibly 
proud of her hard work and accomplishments. 
I wish her the best of luck in December. God 
Bless Alyssa, and God Bless America.

JUDGE JAMES PEREZ POST 
OFFICE 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor and memory of the Honorable Judge 
James Ortega Perez who was from Santa 
Ana, California in my district. He was the first 
Latino judge appointed in Orange County. 
As a child, in July of 1932, his family moved 
to Santa Ana, California where his father pur-
sued new employment opportunities after 
working as a blacksmith in the copper mines. 
Judge Perez attended Santa Ana High School 
and was working in the tomato fields in South-
ern California when he was drafted. He proud-
ly served in the U.S. Army Air Corp from 1944 
to 1946 as a Technical Sergeant. 
Upon returning home from WWII, he en-
rolled at the University of Southern California, 
where he earned a bachelor’s degree in ac-
counting in 1951. In 1955, he earned a J.D. at 
University of Southern California’s Gould 
School of Law. Judge James Perez achieved 
many firsts for the Latino community and his 
honorary work in the legal field paved the way 
for Latino representation in Orange County. 
After passing the bar exam, he was the first 
Latino attorney in Orange County. 
In December 1966, Governor Pat Brown ap-
pointed him to be a judge of the Orange 
County Municipal Court. Nine years later, in 
December of 1975, Governor Jerry Brown ele-
vated him to the Orange County Superior 
Court. He held his title as Superior Court 
judge for 11 years and retired in 1987. In 
1994, he was asked to come back to fill in on 
a part-time basis. 
Afterwards, he went on to become the first 
Latino judge to serve on the Orange County 
Municipal Court and the first Latino judge to 
serve on the Orange County Superior Court. 
Two of his sons, Honorable Judge Michael 
Perez and Honorable Judge Joe T. Perez, are 
current Orange County Superior Court judges. 
Therefore, to honor his service to our na-
tion, I am introducing legislation to name the 
facility of the United States Postal Service lo-
cated on 615 North Bush Street in Santa Ana, 
California as the Judge James Perez Post Of-
fice. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in hon-
oring the memory of Judge James Perez by 
supporting my legislation to name a Post Of-
fice facility in Santa Ana, California so that his 
devotion to his country and the legal commu-
nity may be remembered.

LOST AT SEA MEMORIAL 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 9, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, in Au-
gust, I had the pleasure of attending the Fish-
erman Memorial ceremony in Gardner’s Basin 
in Atlantic City. The Fisherman Memorial me-
morializes local South Jersey individuals who 
have been lost at sea, including veterans and 
Coastguardsman. This ceremony started the 
year after three men, Ed ‘‘Hacksaw’’ Peterson, 
Steve Hayes and Jeff Giannini, were lost at 
sea while traveling on a boat in August of 
1999. Now, the ceremony is held every Au-
gust on or near the anniversary of when the 
Hacksaw Crew went missing. May all the indi-
viduals that have been honored at the cere-
mony rest in peace. God Bless those lost at 
sea, and God Bless America.
