nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for

REMEMBERING THE TRAGEDY OF 
THE BEIRUT BARRACKS ATTACK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to ask my colleagues, and all Ameri-
cans, to never forget the tragedy of the 
Beirut barracks attack. 
On Sunday, October 23, 1983, 241 brave 
American heroes lost their lives in de-
fense of our freedom. That fateful date, 
cowardly 
Iranian-backed 
terrorists, 
Hezbollah, drove truck bombs into the 
U.S. Marine Barracks in Beirut, Leb-
anon. It was the deadliest single-day 
attack against U.S. Marines since the 
battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. 
As a marine and veteran of that con-
flict, I made a promise to always re-
member and honor those fallen. I will 
always remain faithful to that promise. 
God bless America and semper fi. 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize just how awful the crisis 
at our southern border is. 
In the Biden administration’s latest 
show of contempt for this mess, vac-
cine mandates for CBP agents and ICE 
agents will further throw the situation 
in flux. 
Who is the Federal Government to 
force vaccines upon our Border Patrol 
agents, and all of us, when they are not 
holding illegal immigrants entering 
our country to the same standard? 
Sadly, this is another way for Demo-
crats to defund the police, when too 
many CBP agents will be fired or 
forced to quit because getting vac-
cinated is not the right choice for 
them. 
I will continue to denounce these 
lawless and disastrous policies that are 
perpetuating this border crisis. 
CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
HOOSIER GYM 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
the Hoosier Gym. 
Before the Knightstown Gym became 
the Hoosier Gym, home of the Hickory 
Huskers, it served the community for 
64 years, opening its doors back in 1921. 
Many know this iconic locale when it 
became famous with the release of the 
classic movie ‘‘Hoosiers’’ in 1986. 
Congratulations to the Hoosier Gym, 
its staff, and patrons. We are looking 
forward to the next 100 years. 
TURNING THE IRS INTO A POLITICAL WEAPON 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to denounce the disturbing trend we 
have seen of turning the IRS into a po-
litical weapon. 
Democrats have included provisions 
in their reckless tax-and-spending bill 
that will give the IRS rogue authority 
to monitor individuals’ financial bank 
accounts and transactions. 
Whether you are a Democrat or Re-
publican, no one should ever support 
this communistic invasion of privacy 
by our Federal Government. 
BIDEN’S ENERGY CRISIS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address the energy crisis we are fac-
ing. The Biden administration’s poorly 
crafted, radical climate agenda has led 
us here. 
This crisis is already hitting home 
for Hoosiers. An Indiana-based energy 
company just announced that my con-
stituents are going to pay more for 
their energy this winter. What was an 
$88 a month energy bill will now be $133 
a month, a 40 percent increase. 
To those over at 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue who have deemed this a high- 
class problem, wake up. You are taxing 
the middle class through inflation. 
RECOGNIZING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
COMMUNITY OF INDIANA’S SIXTH DISTRICT 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding work our 
men and women of the law enforcement 
community do for Indiana’s Sixth Dis-
trict. 
From Muncie to Madison, and every-
where in between, these hardworking 
Hoosiers are on the front lines of keep-
ing our cities safe. 
Sadly, many of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle want to demon-
ize these heroes. 
To put it simply, thank you to those 
who risk their lives every day so we 
can live ours. 
RECOGNIZING HARDWORKING HOOSIER FARMERS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize our hardworking Hoosier 
farmers as they wrap up their efforts 
for this year’s harvest. 
These fine men and women are the 
backbone of the State and Nation. Be-
cause of their dedication, dinner will 
be on the table today and tomorrow.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND PEACE IN 
DANGER IN COLOMBIA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I just 
returned from leading a fact-finding 
delegation to Colombia from October 3 
to 8. 
I have traveled to Colombia a dozen 
times since 2001. This time, I traveled 
to Cali, a city still reeling from intense 
protests this past spring and the secu-
rity forces’ excessive response. 
It was my second visit to Cali and my 
third to this specific region. I met with 
the mayor of Cali, the Catholic arch-
bishop, youth who had protested, fami-
lies whose children were killed during 
the protests, local journalists, and 
human rights defenders. 
I then traveled an hour south to the 
town of Santander de Quilichao in 
northern Cauca. The Department of 
Cauca leads Colombia in killings of so-
cial leaders and former combatants. 
There, I met with the U.N. Verifica-
tion Mission team monitoring imple-
mentation of the peace accord and had 
a lengthy talk with the town’s mayor. 
I spent the most time with Afro-Colom-
bian, indigenous, campesino, women’s, 
and LGBTQ organizations. 
The next day, I visited the San Juan 
community in Sumapaz, a formerly 
guerrila-controlled region in the Andes 
paramo, 3 hours south of Bogota. 
I traveled with representatives of Bo-
gota’s mayor, whose jurisdiction in-
cludes Sumapaz. I saw water projects 
being carried out by campesinos, indig-
enous, and former combatants. I at-
tended a town meeting where everyone 
was free to have their say. 
In Bogota, I met with our embassy 
and President Duque, leaders of the Co-
lombian police, the U.N. and the OAS, 
the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, U.S. and Colombian security 
analysts, Colombian members of Con-
gress, human rights defenders, and 
journalists. 
I returned disturbed and worried, Mr. 
Speaker. I am deeply concerned about 
the state of human rights, peace, and 
democracy in Colombia. 
I will be listening closely to what 
U.S. officials say on these matters at 
the high-level bilateral dialogue this 
week in Bogota. 
The U.S. has spent over $8.2 billion in 
taxpayer money on military and secu-
rity support for Colombia since 2000. 
Yet, large parts of Colombia aren’t 
under government control or have been 
abandoned by the state. 
Human rights defenders and local 
leaders are targeted and killed. Jour-
nalists are threatened and subject to il-
legal surveillance. The drug trade is 
flourishing, and illegal armed groups 
grow in power. 
I am especially concerned by the 
frustration and fears I heard from orga-
nizations that have been fighting for 
peace for decades but today feel that 
things are going in a wrong and very 
dangerous direction. 
It is painful to remember the hope 
they felt during my last visit in 2017, as 
they made plans inspired by the peace 
accord and its promise of progress. 
For them, Colombia has taken a 
giant step backward, much greater 
than understood from Washington be-
fore my trip. 
Then there were protests this spring 
where we saw the Colombian police 
react violently to legitimate demands 
for education, health, food, and jobs. 
Demonstrators were shot with live am-
munition by a police force that re-
ceives U.S. aid. 
ESMAD, the riot police, not a recipi-
ent of direct U.S. grant assistance, be-
cause of its terrible human rights 
record, used crowd-control equipment 
to wound, maim, and kill demonstra-
tors. Some of this equipment was made 
in the U.S.A. and likely provided 
through commercial sales, which I be-
lieve should immediately stop. 
Mr. Speaker, what do you say to a 
woman who asks whether she is still a 
mother because her only child was 
killed in the protests? How do you 
comfort a father whose son served hon-
orably with the Colombian military 
only to die at the hands of the Colom-
bian police? 
I am also deeply concerned about the 
implementation of the 2016 peace ac-
cord. The agreement provides a road-
map to address longstanding problems 
in Colombia, including those that pro-
voked the protests. 
But it is a comprehensive agreement 
that must be carried out holistically, 
not a few parts here and there, while 
ignoring, undermining, or slow-walking 
the rest. 
But there is reason for hope. In 
Sumapaz, I saw firsthand what a com-
mitted local government and an orga-
nized community can accomplish to es-
tablish peace, security, and develop-
ment that benefits everyone, not just a 
privileged few. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of so many 
of our programs and projects in Colom-
bia. I treasure the friendship between 
the United States and Colombia. As a 
friend and ally, it is critical that the 
U.S. speak frankly and forcefully about 
setbacks to peace, the need for serious 
police 
reform, 
and 
the 
dangerous 
human rights situation. 
If we care about the people of Colom-
bia and their human rights, Congress 
has a responsibility to take a deep look 
at the situation inside Colombia and 
reevaluate the priorities of our aid. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from numerous nongovern-
mental organizations to Secretary of 
State Antony Blinken concerning the 
upcoming high-level bilateral dialogue. 
OCTOBER 18, 2021. 
Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN, 
The State Department, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SECRETARY BLINKEN: As you travel to 
Colombia for the high-level bilateral dia-
logue, we urge you to use this opportunity to 
press the Colombian government for progress 
on flagging peace accord implementation 
and for actions on critical human rights 
issues, including improving the dire situa-
tion of human rights defenders, advancing 
the rights of Afro-Colombian and indigenous 
people, addressing the needs of poor and 
landless farmers, and confronting the serious 
problems of police brutality and racial injus-
tice. 
As organizations that have followed events 
in Colombia for many years, many of us with 
programs and close partners in the country, 
we are gravely disappointed that to date the 
Biden Administration has not placed suffi-
cient emphasis on these issues and hope that 
your visit will mark a change. We urge you 
to avoid public statements that praise the 
U.S.-Colombian partnership while skirting 
over the deeply disturbing patterns of human 
rights violations that should be a major 
focus of U.S. concern and diplomacy. 
Police brutality. In response to massive, 
largely peaceful demonstrations against a 
regressive tax initiative, unemployment, and 
social exclusion, Colombian security forces, 
particularly the national police and the 
ESMAD riot squad, killed and injured pro-
testers, mainly teenagers and young adults. 
Eighty-seven civilians were killed in the 
course of the protests according to the De-
fender la Libertad human rights campaign. 
Police shot live ammunition and projectiles 
into crowds, including in one case into a 
group of families and neighbors assembled 
for a candlelight vigil for a young man killed 
the day before, causing major injuries, loss 
of eyesight, and death. Police and ESMAD 
targeted, 
along 
with 
protesters, 
human 
rights defenders, journalists, and medical 
brigade members who provided first aid to 
protesters and police. Police sexually abused 
young women protesters and threatened 
women first aid responders with rape. Fam-
ily members of victims of police brutality 
and human rights defenders seeking justice 
for police abuses are stigmatized and their 
lives threatened. Following these tragic 
events, rather than taking significant action 
to advance dialogue, police reform, and pros-
ecutions of abusive security forces, the Co-
lombian government has presented only su-
perficial police reforms and appears focused 
on investigating and prosecuting protesters 
and those who helped them. Few cases of se-
curity force abuses during the 2021 protests 
are moving forward in civilian courts; 13 
homicide cases involving security forces 
have been reported as inappropriately in the 
military justice system, which rarely results 
in justice. 
Peace accord implementation and situa-
tion of human rights defenders. The historic 
2016 peace accords, a major legacy of the 
Obama-Biden Administration due to its sup-
port for negotiations, are at risk due to weak 
implementation. As of September 2021, 292 
FARC ex-combatants have been killed since 
laying down their arms. Moreover Colombia 
remains one of the most dangerous countries 
on earth to be a human rights defender; 158 
human rights defenders were killed so far 
this year in 2021, according to the United Na-
tions. For the second year in a row, Colom-
bia leads the world in murders of environ-
mental and land rights defenders, according 
to Global Witness. Colombia’s community 
leaders are in danger precisely because they 
are building peace on the ground, while the 
government has failed to implement its 
peace accord commitments, including dis-
mantling paramilitary networks, protecting

communities, and bringing effective and 
rights-respecting state presence into conflict 
zones. Peace accord consolidation is espe-
cially weak in terms of implementing the 
Ethnic Chapter and gender provisions; pro-
tection of human rights defenders, social 
leaders, and communities; dismantling para-
military networks; protection of ex- combat-
ants; provision of adequate programs for 
farmers committed to coca eradication, and 
implementation of the comprehensive rural 
reform, including provision of land to dis-
placed persons, poor farmers, and indigenous 
and Afro-Colombian people. While U.S. aid to 
advance peace accord implementation is im-
portant and well-targeted, the failure to ad-
vance peace accord implementation is not 
primarily a question of resources, but of po-
litical will. 
As you dialogue with the Colombian gov-
ernment, we ask you to publicly as well as 
privately: 
Insist, as a condition of any future U.S. se-
curity assistance, that the Colombian gov-
ernment implement serious police reform, 
including transferring the police from the 
Defense Ministry to a civilian agency, ensur-
ing all human rights abuses by police are 
tried in civilian courts, dismantling the 
ESMAD, revising use-of-force-protocols, and 
establishing external oversight and controls 
over the police. Limiting reforms to increas-
ing human rights courses and revising inter-
nal disciplinary procedures is not an ade-
quate response. The U.S. government should 
also encourage progress on prosecuting cases 
in civilian courts against security force 
members involved in abuses in the context of 
the protests, raise concerns regarding spe-
cious or excessive prosecutions of protesters, 
and urge the Colombian government to re-
spect the right to protest. 
Urge the Colombian government to recom-
mit to fully implementing the peace accords. 
It is essential to maintain U.S. diplomatic 
and financial support for implementing the 
accords as the central framework for U.S. 
policy towards Colombia. Please also express 
publicly support for the work of the tri-
partite transitional justice system, namely 
the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), the 
Truth Commission, and the Search Unit for 
the Disappeared. 
Express publicly your concerns about the 
grave dangers faced by Colombian human 
rights defenders and social leaders and em-
phasize the importance of their role in build-
ing peace and defending the rule of law. U.S.- 
Colombia actions to address climate change 
should also include protection of the rights 
and lives of endangered environmental activ-
ists, who are on the frontlines of efforts to 
protect the planet. 
Urge 
the 
Colombian 
government 
to 
promptly and regularly convene the National 
Commission on Security Guarantees estab-
lished by the peace accords, which should in-
clude participation by civil society, govern-
ment, and ex-combatants, to develop and im-
plement a plan for dismantling paramilitary 
and other illegal armed networks and for 
providing security to human rights defend-
ers, communities, and ex-combatants. This 
long-delayed commitment, central to bring 
rights-respecting security to conflict zones 
and protecting human rights defenders, must 
advance. 
Urge the Colombian government to uphold 
the rights of Afro-Colombian, indigenous, 
and Palenquero people. Ask the Colombian 
government to prioritize implementing the 
peace agreement’s Ethnic Chapter. The gov-
ernment should convene the Special High- 
Level 
Mechanism 
with 
Ethnic 
Peoples 
(IANPE), mandated by the peace accords, to 
discuss the best methods to implement the 
Ethnic Chapter and should work with Afro- 
Colombian and indigenous authorities and 
civil rights groups to guarantee its consoli-
dation at the local and regional level. In ad-
dition, urge the Colombian government to 
implement the humanitarian accords with 
communities that serve to protect such com-
munities, ensure assistance and protection 
to internally displaced persons, and address 
racial discrimination including the Humani-
tarian Accord Now in Choco´. We would 
greatly welcome the revitalization of the 
U.S.-Colombian 
Racial 
Action 
Plan 
(CAPREE) and the development of a joint 
U.S.-Colombian strategy with specific steps 
to address structural racism. 
Urge 
the 
Colombian 
government 
to 
prioritize full and effective implementation 
of provisions to achieve ‘‘a genuine struc-
tural transformation of the countryside’’ as 
agreed under the Comprehensive Rural Re-
form chapter of the peace accords. This is 
critical to address the exclusion and inequal-
ity in rural areas, particularly in access to 
land, which is a root cause as well as a con-
sequence of conflict in Colombia. Only lim-
ited progress has been made in implementing 
provisions to improve access to land, due in 
part to administrative delays and inadequate 
allocation of resources, and to a focus on for-
malizing tenure rather than redistributing 
land. Peace is unlikely to be sustainable as 
long as many poor, landless, marginalized, 
and displaced rural families see no improve-
ment in their lives and livelihoods, which de-
pend on access to land. 
Urge the Colombian government to address 
the failure to uphold its commitments out-
lined in the Labor Action Plan (LAP) and en-
sure that labor rights are fully applied and 
protected in Colombia. As detailed in the 
U.S. Department of Labor’s recently released 
Second Periodic Review of Progress of the 
Colombia Labor Rights Complaint Submis-
sion dated October 7, 2021, a number of issues 
and benchmarks of the 2017 Submission Re-
port recommendations have not been satis-
factorily addressed and improved upon by 
the Colombian government. As the lack of 
labor rights enforcement and protection are 
an underlying factor in economic inequality 
and civic unrest, advancement on labor 
rights issues is critical and should be strong-
ly emphasized by the U.S. government with 
Colombia. 
Insist on progress on reforms of Colombian 
military and intelligence services, including 
to end persistent patterns of surveillance 
over human rights defenders and other civil 
society leaders, journalists, and judicial per-
sonnel. While members of the military who 
committed gross human rights violations 
can receive transitional justice benefits by 
collaborating with the JEP and providing 
the truth about their crimes, the Colombian 
government must still be urged to provide 
accountability for the more than 6,000 extra- 
judicial executions by members of the Co-
lombian armed forces, largely of poor young 
men executed and dressed up in guerrilla 
uniforms to be claimed as enemy dead. 
The United States should also uphold the 
peace accords directly through its own pol-
icy choices. First, the United States should 
support counternarcotics policy that abides 
by the peace accords’ drug policy chapter. 
Such support must focus on working with 
small farmer communities to eradicate and 
replace coca, providing sufficient support for 
such farmers and communities to thrive, and 
must refrain from employing harsh and inef-
fective tactics such as aerial spraying. Re-
starting spraying will be seen as under-
mining the accords and will drive away farm-
ers from cooperating. The peace accords em-
phasize dismantling drug trafficking and 
money laundering networks, which are U.S. 
priorities. Second, the United States should 
remove the Comunes Party from the ter-
rorist list. It is counterproductive to main-
tain on this list ex-combatants who have 
shown their commitment to peace for the 
last five years. It demonstrates an ambiva-
lence towards accords the United States 
helped to forge and hampers the ability of 
the United States and partners to provide 
support for reintegration and even for broad-
er community development programs in 
areas with ex-combatants’ presence. 
It is in the interests of both Colombia and 
the United States that peace be consoli-
dated, police and military become more 
rights respecting, discrimination and vio-
lence against Afro-Colombian and indigenous 
peoples end, and human rights defenders be 
able to operate without fear for their lives. 
Only by challenging the Colombian govern-
ment to address these serious underlying 
problems in Colombia can the United States 
contribute to this more hopeful future.

THE MITFORD MUSEUM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, in 1994, Jan 
Karon, an author from North Carolina, 
released a novel titled ‘‘At Home in 
Mitford.’’ That novel was the first of 14 
she wrote in a series that depicted a 
small town located in western North 
Carolina. 
To be clear, the town of Mitford is 
purely fictional, but, in fact, it was 
based off a town in North Carolina’s 
Fifth District where Jan Karon grew up 
and drew inspiration from, the town of 
Hudson. 
In early October, it was my privilege 
and honor, along with hundreds of peo-
ple from 31 different States, to be in 
Hudson for the dedication ceremony of 
the new Mitford Museum. 
The mission of this museum is to 
share the small-town values, through 
artifacts and archives, that relate to 
western 
North 
Carolina 
and 
Jan 
Karon’s novels with those who visit. 
One of the museum’s objectives is to 
also to enrich both reading and writing 
appreciation and enhancing the lit-
erary skills in youth and adults. Those 
important endeavors are worthy of 
praise. 
Jan Karon, along with many of us, 
grew up learning and appreciating the 
small-town values which have helped 
make our country great. By sharing 
them with her readers, she helps pre-
serve the continuity of those values so

that generations both present and fu-
ture will carry them forward. 
We all long for America to return to 
those simple values and not stray off 
course. Think about what some of 
those values are. They are comradery, 
service, sense of community, putting in 
a hard day’s work, and family. 
If you were to take the time and 
travel across North Carolina’s Fifth 
District, you would find salt-of-the- 
earth people who live and breathe 
those values. Those values are alive 
and well in every small business, super-
market, 
church, 
community, 
and 
neighborhood in the Fifth District and 
across the entire country. 
You see, small-town values are not a 
euphemism for exclusivity or division. 
They are values that transcend bound-
aries such as socioeconomic status, po-
litical affiliation, and geography. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
consider 
myself 
blessed to have been raised in a small 
town and to have learned those values 
at a young age. Throughout my life, I 
have carried them with me. 
It is even more of a blessing that I 
have been entrusted to serve small 
towns like Hudson and so many others 
that are the lifeblood of western North 
Carolina. 
I encourage everyone to visit the 
town of Hudson and see exactly what I 
mean. Take some time to learn about 
the values that small towns across this 
country are built on and how, over 
time, they have made such an impact 
upon everyday people. 
The undeniable truth is that small- 
town values will forever be America’s 
values. 
SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, as a former 
educator, it is clear to me that the 
Biden administration needs some seri-
ous math tutoring. The September jobs 
report resembles an incomplete assign-
ment that a student turned in at the 
very last minute. 
Out of 500,000 projected jobs, only 
194,000 were added. Five million jobs 
are still unrecovered in America, and 
labor participation has slumped to 61.6 
percent. It is the worst jobs report of 
the year, and there are roughly 3 
months left to go. 
That report rightfully deserves an F, 
and it tacks on another chapter of this 
administration making promises it 
cannot meet. Yet again, the so-called 
Build Back Better agenda falls flat on 
its face and the numbers do not lie.

CHILD CARE CRISIS IN AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to spend a few minutes to talk 
about an October 15 visit to Con-
necticut by President Biden where he 
actually put the eyes of the country for 
a couple of hours on a critical issue 
that his Build Back Better agenda is 
focused on fixing, which is, namely, the 
crisis in child daycare all across the 
country. 
On Friday, my colleagues and I, as 
well as President Biden, visited the 
Capitol 
Child 
Development 
Center, 
where the executive director, Barbara 
Jo Warner, laid out very clearly the di-
lemma that she and her colleagues who 
are in this very struggling sector are 
faced with today. 
Before COVID, her center had 70 slots 
for children completely full, with a 
waiting list. Today, they have 20 chil-
dren in the same daycare center. 
Is it because there is no demand? No, 
that is not the case. There still is a 
waiting list of families who are trying 
to get their kids into daycare. 
Her problem is that the staffing that 
she had prior to COVID has severely di-
minished, and her ability to attract 
people back into her program is lim-
ited by the fact that she is only able to 
offer $13 an hour as a starting wage for 
people in a very important job for our 
country as well as families of the chil-
dren that they take care of. 
So we are in a situation where they 
are in a place where McDonald’s pays 
more, at $15 an hour, than a daycare 
center, at $13 an hour. 
It is a problem which is, I think, one 
of the reasons why the jobs recovery 
has stalled, particularly for families 
and women heads-of-household who, 
again, don’t have centers with slots 
available because of the staffing prob-
lem that Ms. Warner described to the 
President and to the world on Friday. 
The Build Back Better legislation, he 
discussed it, finally, in a different kind 
of context, in terms of the horse race 
down here and who is up, who is down, 
which faction is negotiating what. He 
focused on the content of the Build 
Back Better legislation, which is ad-
dressed to provide a huge infusion of 
support for our daycare sector. 
What that provision will do is cap the 
amount of out-of-pocket for families 
who are using child daycare at 7 per-
cent of income. Today, low- and mid-
dle-income families spend between 14 
and 35 percent of their income on 
daycare. If we get this through, we are 
immediately going to provide savings 
for families with their kids in daycare. 
In Connecticut, looking at a family 
making $87,000 a year, that basically 
would result in weekly savings of $175 a 
week, which is definitely a huge boost 
in terms of working families and mid-
dle-class families, which this bill would 
provide. 
Again, I want to emphasize, this is 
not a Connecticut problem. This is hap-
pening all across the country, and the 
median or the average salary for 
daycare centers across the country is 
actually $12 an hour, a little lower 
than what the President heard about 
on Friday. 
If we are serious about a real job re-
covery and giving families the oppor-
tunity to really go back to work, why 
don’t we listen to the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, the largest business organi-
zation in the country, which recognized 
during COVID that support for child 
daycare is essential, in terms of trying 
to get working-age families back into 
the workforce. 
Again, the openings are there. I could 
walk through employers in the State of 
Connecticut. Electric Boat in my dis-
trict has about 500 job openings right 
now. They want to get those Gen Z’ers 
and millennials trained up and ready to 
go. But if they don’t have a place for 
their children to be cared for safely and 
adequately, then we are just basically 
in a cul-de-sac where this economy is 
going to be held back. 
The Build Back Better agenda is not 
soft infrastructure. It is right at the 
heart of whether or not we are going 
to, as a country, fully recover and grow 
in the wake of this pandemic. 
It is something that hopefully every 
Member, when the time comes for this 
package, when that daycare provision 
is included in there, will think about 
long and hard because this is not a 
Connecticut-only issue. This affects 
every State, red and blue; every dis-
trict, red and blue; every employer, in 
red and blue areas of the country. If 
anyone can’t support that, then they 
are not serious about really helping 
this country recover from the pan-
demic. 
Again, I thank the President for com-
ing out and really focusing like a laser 
on this issue. I thank Executive Direc-
tor Barbara Jo Warner for her clear 
message to the country.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FOREST 
PRODUCTS WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize this 
week as National Forest Products 
Week. 
In 
Pennsylvania, 
forest 
products 
have long been an essential industry by 
producing 
logs, 
lumber, 
furniture, 
paper, and more. These are products 
and materials that Americans nation-
wide use each and every day. 
The forest products industry employs 
roughly 64,000 Pennsylvanians and gen-
erates $36 billion in total economic im-
pact statewide. 
I am proud to represent Pennsylva-
nia’s only national forest, the Alle-
gheny National Forest. This incredible 
forest, established in 1923, spans more 
than half a million acres in the north-
ern portion of my district, across For-
est, Elk, McKean, and Warren Coun-
ties. 
Whether it is forestry, energy pro-
duction, timber harvesting, or an abun-
dance of outdoor activities, Allegheny 
National Forest has it all. 
For 
generations, 
the 
ANF 
has 
brought economic prosperity to our re-
gion, and it is essential that we are 
able to contribute to the longevity and

sustainability of the Allegheny Na-
tional Forest. 
In my role as Republican leader on 
the House Agriculture Committee, I 
am dedicated to putting forth policies 
that promote natural solutions to keep 
our forests healthy for generations to 
come. 
These policies include working close-
ly with the Forest Service, a division 
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
to manage our forests, foster healthier 
lands, and allow this economic engine 
to thrive. 
By supporting the Forest Service and 
encouraging active stewardship, we can 
support healthy forests and rural com-
munities for generations to come. 
Currently, we have two bills focused 
on improving our forest management: 
the 
RESTORE 
Act 
from 
DOUG 
LAMALFA from California and the FIRE 
Act from DUSTY JOHNSON from South 
Dakota. These bills aim to improve and 
expedite forest management and res-
toration projects for healthier and 
more resilient forests. 
Of course, we cannot talk about for-
est products without discussing the en-
vironmental benefits of a well-managed 
forest and forest productivity. We 
know the best solutions are natural so-
lutions, not burdensome regulations or 
carbon taxes, but active innovation. 
Landowners and foresters are among 
the strongest environmental advocates 
in our country. I recognize their efforts 
and continue to promote forest health 
by empowering the original stewards of 
our land. 
According to the Forest Service, for-
ests are sequestering 14 percent of all 
U.S. carbon emissions. That number 
could nearly double with policies that 
increase forest management, forest 
health, and forest production. 
Active management, including tim-
bering, holds the greatest potential for 
sequestering carbon and storing it in-
definitely in forest products. 
To help encourage new markets for 
forest products and forest health, I was 
proud to help lead the Timber Innova-
tion Act. This bipartisan legislation, 
which was included in the 2018 farm 
bill, directly supports the development 
of cross-laminated timber and tall 
wood building construction. 
Mr. Speaker, Forest Products Week 
is more than forestry or timber har-
vesting. It is a time to focus on the 
great resources our forests provide. 
From a natural habitat for wildlife, to 
an abundance of outdoor recreational 
activities, to carbon sequestration, to a 
strong rural economy, our forests, big 
and small, must continue to be utilized 
for our needs today and for our future 
generations. 
f 
TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THE 
NATIONAL STOCKPILE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to pass my 
bill, the Strengthening America’s Stra-
tegic National Stockpile Act, so that 
we never again are dependent on for-
eign manufacturers for the supplies we 
need to keep Americans safe. 
This bipartisan bill, brought to this 
Chamber by eight Democrats and eight 
Republicans, would make sure our 
country never again endures what we 
went through in those early days of the 
COVID–19 pandemic when we all re-
ceived those urgent calls, only to learn 
that our stockpile, the national stock-
pile, would only provide a fraction of 
what we needed, many pieces inside ex-
pired, some of them molding. 
This bill would ensure that we have a 
properly maintained national stockpile 
of medical supplies so that our doctors, 
nurses, and frontline workers have the 
personal protective equipment they 
need to protect themselves while help-
ing others. 
Put yourself back into the mindset of 
April 2020: frantic calls and e-mails 
from essential workers begging for 
help. As cases of COVID surged, both in 
our hospitals and in our nursing homes, 
our frontline workers made it clear 
that they simply didn’t have enough 
protective equipment to keep them-
selves safe. 
In fact, the National Institutes of 
Health conducted a study on why we 
have a shortage of protective equip-
ment. Through that study, they found 
that the U.S. anticipated—we knew— 
that our national supply would come 
up short, and they estimated that we 
would need 3.5 billion N95 masks to 
protect Americans from a pandemic 
that affected only a third of our coun-
try. This is why we cannot move on 
without cleaning up our system. 
In 2020, every Member of this body 
was hearing from doctors, nurses, and 
first responders who were bravely bat-
tling this disease and improvised face 
shields and homemade solutions to pro-
tect themselves. 
I still think about the physician in 
Brighton, Michigan, who compared his 
job to being a soldier on the front lines, 
wearing only a T-shirt and a baseball 
cap instead of body armor and a hel-
met; or the nurses in Mason, Michigan, 
who had to share one gown, not per 
person, but for the entire staff on a 
COVID ward. 
In response, I found myself doing 
anything and everything I could to se-
cure protective equipment for Michi-
gan: calling mask manufacturers, nego-
tiating with companies in China, and 
fighting for each and every shipment. I 
was sending Ziplocs of 10 masks to our 
nursing homes individually. If a Con-
gresswoman is negotiating in the dead 
of night with a Chinese middleman for 
masks, our supply chains have offi-
cially failed us. 
This searing experience shook me to 
my core. We can and must do better to 
protect Americans and to learn from 
our mistakes. 
This bill, the Strengthening Amer-
ica’s Strategic National Stockpile Act, 
would ensure that if States ever need 
to turn to it, our stockpile will be fully 
supplied, maintained, and ready to go. 
It requires constant maintenance and 
inventory checks to make sure items 
aren’t expired. We need to make the 
distribution process transparent. It 
helps States to create their own local 
stockpiles, and it prevents waste of 
taxpayer dollars by allowing the stock-
pile to sell excess supplies to other 
agencies before they expire. 
Perhaps most importantly, this bill 
incentivizes production of critical med-
ical supplies right here at home, in the 
United States. Through a $500 million 
program, the stockpile will partner di-
rectly with American manufacturers to 
expand capacity and strengthen our do-
mestic supply chains. 
Now, in Michigan, we get it. Before 
the pandemic, the mere mention of 
supply chains was enough to put some 
to sleep. But the last year and a half 
has changed that. The issue is now on 
the front page of every paper and at 
the heart of every key business and 
policy decision. 
From masks to microchips, the dis-
ruptions we have experienced have 
forced us to pull back the curtain and 
take a hard look at the systems we 
rely on in our daily lives. Michiganders 
have been saying this for 30 years. If 
you outsource our supply chains too 
far to China, it becomes a national se-
curity issue, and it has. 
Here in Congress, we have a responsi-
bility to respond to the way this crisis 
has shook our communities for our 
first responders and our businesses. I 
ask my colleagues from both sides of 
the aisle to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this critical 
piece of legislation. Help clean up the 
mess that was on display last year. 
That is our job and our responsibility 
to the next crisis.

HIGHLIGHTING DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. TONY GONZALES) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to highlight Octo-
ber as Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month. 
There is a lot going on in the world 
right now, and it is very easy to forget 
that we have millions of Americans 
who are living in a very abusive envi-
ronment. 
Many people walk around with scars 
that everyone can see. But also, many 
of us walk around with scars that no-
body can see. In particular, I would 
like to highlight the women who are in 
this very difficult situation. 
When I was 5 years old, I recall when 
my mother woke me up in the middle 
of the night to sneak us out of our very 
abusive home, and I remember spend-
ing time in a battered women’s shelter. 
That moment will never leave me. 
Looking back at it now, my mother 
was the bravest woman that I knew 
then and the bravest woman that I 
know now.

And it doesn’t have to be this way. 
People don’t have to be in an environ-
ment that is constantly under abuse. 
You can leave, whether that is today, 
whether that is tomorrow, whether 
that is decades from now. 
Today, I am very proud. Years ago, 
my mother left that abusive environ-
ment. Just last year, she was able to 
get her bachelor’s degree from the Uni-
versity of Texas at El Paso, UTEP. It 
was amazing for her to go back and get 
her education. 
Today, she lives with me. She, along 
with my wife, Angel, helps raise our 
children. And today, she is in an envi-
ronment where she is loved. 
This 
month, 
Domestic 
Violence 
Awareness Month, we can’t lose sight 
of that. If you are in a violent situa-
tion, you, too, can get out. You, too, 
can change the direction of your life, 
and your children can go off and be 
very successful because we live in the 
greatest country on Earth. Whether it 
is today, tomorrow, or a decade from 
now, please leave your abusive environ-
ment and get back to a place of happi-
ness and love.

STRIKETOBER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
from this podium, and on the streets of 
Chicago, I have spoken out quite a bit 
about essential workers. 
They work every day to keep our 
country going, often risking their 
lives, their families, and they deserve 
respect and dignity on the job. 
But today, I want to talk about the 
courage that it takes not to go to work 
and to go out on strike for better work-
ing conditions. 
As we speak, thousands of workers 
are on strike; from the nurses and 
healthcare workers to the people who 
make cereal, tractors, and whiskey. 
And tens of thousands more have taken 
strike votes and are ready to join them 
if they can’t reach agreements with 
their employers. 
It is a strike wave, and we are calling 
it ‘‘Striketober.’’ 
And I stand today in solidarity with 
these workers who are fighting for 
safer working conditions, a decent liv-
ing wage, and the ability to retire with 
dignity. 
Just in the past few weeks in my city 
of Chicago, I stood with Nabisco work-
ers from the Bakery, Confectionery, 
Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ 
International Union, auto mechanics 
from the International Association of 
Machinists, and employees at the Art 
Institute of Chicago who are fighting 
to join a union, AFSCME. 
Only days later, the workers at a 
local tortilla plant in my own neigh-
borhood, El Milagro, walked out pro-
testing an unsafe workplace, unfair 
wages, and sexual harassment at the 
company’s plants. 
In recent years, teachers, nurses, 
county employees, nursing home work-
ers, and even the symphony orchestra 
performers in our city went on strike. 
They aren’t just striking for them-
selves, they fought to provide commu-
nity resources in our schools, improve 
patient care for our seniors, and create 
art for the public. 
These workers and their struggles 
are the newest chapters of Chicago’s 
historic role as the center of our coun-
try’s labor movement. 
International 
Workers’ 
Day—cele-
brated around the world on May 1— 
commemorates the Haymarket pro-
tests in Chicago in 1886, which led to 
the 8-hour workday and ended child 
labor. 
The Pullman strike, brutally sup-
pressed by our own government, is 
commemorated every year on Labor 
Day. 
This is my own history, too. 
I came to Chicago as an immigrant 
from Mexico, and my parents’ jobs and 
benefits as Teamsters—and my own 
work as a member of the Retail Work-
ers Union, as a member of the Team-
sters, the United Legal Workers affili-
ated with the UAW—helped make me 
who I am today. 
So when these workers walk out on 
strike, they walk out for all of us. 
Safety at work, dignity in retire-
ment, a living wage, these are impor-
tant issues for everyone. 
There is a picket line chant that 
says, ‘‘If we can’t get it, shut it down.’’ 
And it is time that working-class peo-
ple did just that. 
Striketober was a long time coming. 
The Federal minimum wage has been 
at $7.25 for over a decade, but million-
aires got 62 percent richer during the 
pandemic. 
A vial of insulin costs $6 to make, 
but pharmaceutical companies sell it 
for as much as $275. 
Rent, childcare, and medical bills go 
up and up, and pundits won’t stop com-
plaining about wage inflation. 
So workers across the country are 
standing up to say: Enough is enough. 
And they are standing up for us. 
So we have got to support these 
workers on the picket lines any way we 
can. 
In Congress, this means supporting 
proworker legislation, like the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act and 
the Public Service Freedom to Nego-
tiate Act, which guarantees workplace 
rights. 
It means protecting frontline work-
ers, from nurses to CTA bus drivers, to 
Instacart shoppers. 
It means supporting workers at the 
bargaining table and on the picket line 
because when workers fight, we all win. 
Si, se puede. Yes, we can.

RECOGNIZING RAYMOND ANDREW 
SMITH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize an extraor-
dinary sacrifice by a resident of Brook-
lyn, New York. 
Private First Class Raymond Andrew 
Smith was 18 years old when he made 
the ultimate sacrifice for our country 
during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, 
in the Korean war. 
Growing up, Raymond and his sister 
Helen experienced a difficult childhood 
in foster care, forcing them to take on 
responsibilities far beyond their years. 
And despite the challenges he faced, at 
the age of 14 Raymond joined the Navy. 
Once Raymond’s age was discovered 
by his superiors, the Navy granted him 
an 
honorable 
discharge, 
but 
that 
wouldn’t stop Raymond’s drive for 
service. Four years later, Raymond en-
listed in the United States Army, and 
after 6 months, he was shipped off to 
fight in the Korean war. 
The Korean war began in June of 1950 
when 
General 
Douglas 
MacArthur, 
alongside South Korean and U.N. forces 
made significant progress into the 
north with hopes of uniting the two 
countries again. 
However, Communist China under 
Mao Zedong had other plans, and sent 
roughly 100,000 troops to the Chosin 
Reservoir to counter progress made by 
America and our allies, leading to the 
Battle of Chosin Reservoir. 
With the 7th Infantry Division, Ray-
mond fought in this battle, a battle 
many military experts and scholars 
consider to be one of the most brutal 
conflicts in modern history due to the 
sheer fierceness of our opponents and 
severe weather elements. 
For 17 days, the Battle of Chosin Res-
ervoir raged on. In that timeframe, it 
is estimated that the United States 
suffered 18,000 casualties, while the 
Chinese suffered upward of 50,000 cas-
ualties, 30,000 just from the freezing 
cold alone. During the battle, tempera-
tures were said to have dropped to a 
chilling negative 35 degrees Fahr-
enheit. Medical supplies froze solid, 
rendering them useless, weapons seized 
and failed to function, and digging fox-
holes was nearly impossible without 
the use of machinery. At negative 35 
degrees Fahrenheit, the human body 
sets into hypothermic shock in only 5 
to 7 minutes. 
Private First Class Raymond Smith 
was one of the first to make contact 
with the enemy. Raymond and his 
peers were vastly outnumbered, and 
while they fought valiantly, he was 
sadly reported missing on December 2, 
1950, presumed to be dead. 
On July 27, 2018, following a summit 
between then-President Donald Trump 
and North Korean supreme leader Kim 
Jong-un, North Korea returned 55 boxes 
that contained the remains of Amer-
ican servicemembers killed during the 
Korean war. 
And on March 25, 2021, Raymond’s 
family received closure when his re-
mains were finally identified and ac-
counted for after 71 unbearable years 
for his family. Raymond’s remains

were returned to New York City, where 
his sister Helen, her children, a full 
U.S. military honor guard, and the 
Port Authority Police were there to 
welcome him home. 
I am taking this time today to en-
sure Raymond’s memory lives on and 
his sacrifices will not be forgotten. 
Currently, there are more than 81,600 
Americans that remain missing from 
World War II, the Korean war, the 
Vietnam war, the Cold War, the Gulf 
wars, and other conflicts. Let this give 
us hope that we can return them all 
home. 
I urge the administration and my 
colleagues to work toward the return 
of all prisoners of war and a full ac-
counting and the repatriation of our 
fallen servicemembers’ remains.

ALL AMERICANS DESERVE SAFE, 
CLEAN, 
STABLE, 
AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. STRICKLAND) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, all 
Americans, regardless of age, ZIP Code, 
or income, deserve to live in a safe, 
clean, and stable home they can afford. 
This is exactly what a healthy, just, 
and secure community relies on. It en-
sures that people are able to meet their 
basic needs. When over 145,000 Social 
Security beneficiaries in my district, 
the 10th 
Congressional District of 
Washington State—representing nearly 
21 percent of the population—only have 
100 to $200 to spare for groceries, utili-
ties, and other basic expenses after 
paying their rent or mortgage, we 
know that prosperity is not being 
shared equally, nor equitably. 
When our servicemembers at Joint 
Base Lewis-McChord simply cannot 
find homes off post or on post for their 
families, due to lack of supply or the 
cost of housing, we must clearly im-
prove our mission to support our Na-
tion’s heroes. 
These are just a few of the stories 
that thousands of Washington State 
residents 
and 
families 
are 
experi-
encing, just like millions of Americans 
across the country. And we know the 
driving factor behind this housing cri-
sis is lack of supply. We don’t have 
enough housing, and we aren’t building 
it fast enough to meet the demand. 
And some of the housing that we do 
have is not fit for human habitation. 
According to Up for Growth, an orga-
nization that advocates for more hous-
ing, their report on housing under-
production from 2010 to 2017 in Wash-
ington State identifies some startling 
data points: For every one household 
that moved into my district, there 
were .64 housing units produced in 
Pierce County, .76 in Thurston County, 
and .62 housing units in Mason County. 
So this means that for every family 
that moved into our district, that we 
were producing two-thirds to three- 
quarters of the housing that we needed 
to accommodate them. This also means 
that for over 7 years the population in-
creased and demand far outpaced sup-
ply, resulting in this crunch or lack of 
inventory that so many families are 
feeling right now. 
What’s more, there remains a short-
age of nearly 160,000 homes for ex-
tremely low-income renters, and nearly 
half a million renters in Washington 
State are rent-burdened, which means 
that they spend more than 30 percent 
of their income on housing alone. 
Now housing experts have told us 
that we need a once-in-a-generation so-
lution to our housing supply shortage. 
That time is now. Now is our oppor-
tunity to build smarter, build better, 
and to do it inclusively. 
We have solutions on the table, and 
it is well past time to use them. We can 
build to higher-density inside transit 
corridors, leveraging existing infra-
structure. That is why I was so proud 
to help introduce the bipartisan Build 
More Housing Near Transit Act with 
Representative SCOTT PETERS to make 
sure that when we are investing $2.3 
billion each year for large-scale transit 
projects, we are ensuring that local 
land use policies, which are often the 
biggest barrier to increasing housing 
supply, will encourage sensible devel-
opment around these major infrastruc-
ture investments. For so long we have 
built housing infrastructure around 
automobiles and that is a relic of the 
past; now we must invest in transit to 
utilize good and smart land use poli-
cies. 
For our military servicemembers and 
their families, we can find solutions in 
our National Defense Authorization 
Act provisions, which passed out of the 
House in a bipartisan manner just 
weeks ago. I offered one provision, 
which will direct the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Energy, Installa-
tions, and Environment to answer one 
question: How long are wait times for 
housing located on military installa-
tions in competitive housing markets? 
And we want them to produce a strat-
egy to address this demand for housing. 
It is simply unacceptable that serv-
icemembers and their families must 
wait more than 6 months to be as-
signed housing on Joint Base Lewis- 
McChord. I urge all of my colleagues to 
support this inclusion of several re-
ports that will address the issue, in-
cluding a report on how and the extent 
to which commanders of military in-
stallations are connecting military 
families with local nonprofit organiza-
tions and government entities that 
provide services to the military, in-
cluding assistance with finding hous-
ing. 
And importantly, we must pass both 
our bipartisan infrastructure proposal 
and the Build Back Better Act and spe-
cifically deploy the Unlocking Possi-
bilities Program. 
This 
competitive 
grant 
program 
through HUD will be used to support 
cities and towns to design and imple-
ment policies that eliminate exclu-
sionary zoning and artificial barriers 
to adding more housing. I urge all of 
my colleagues to work to retain this 
important program in our build back 
better proposal. 
Being securely housed is a funda-
mental human right regardless of your 
political affiliation. The cost of con-
tinuing to ignore our lack of supply is 
far too great, especially when the tools 
we need are at our disposal. Let’s use 
them, and let’s show our constituents 
that we can and will build back better. 
To do otherwise is irresponsible.

THE BABY FOLD—2021 ANGELS IN 
ADOPTION HONOREE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize The 
Baby Fold in Normal, Illinois, for being 
chosen as a 2021 Angels in Adoption 
honoree. I nominated The Baby Fold 
this year because of their passion for 
adoption support and services through-
out my Congressional district. 
Since 1902, The Baby Fold has been 
transforming the lives of children and 
families by focusing on the Christian 
values of love, hope, and healing. They 
currently serve over 1,200 individuals 
each year across 28 different counties 
in Central Illinois. 
The Baby Fold focuses on improving 
the lives of children and families by 
building safe environments through 
adoption services, foster care to adop-
tion, community services, and more. 
The Baby Fold puts children first so 
that they can be blessed with the sta-
bility and love that they deserve. 
Every day, I am grateful for adoption 
organizations that bring families to-
gether, like The Baby Fold. I applaud 
The Baby Fold and their volunteers for 
their strong dedication to children and 
families throughout Illinois. 
TAYLORVILLE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AWARDED 
THE NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Taylorville Junior High School regard-
ing their selection for the National 
Blue Ribbon from the U.S. Department 
of Education. 
The National Blue Ribbon is awarded 
to schools for their academic achieve-
ment or their progress in closing the 
achievement gaps among student sub-
groups. 
Mrs. Jessica Miller, the principal at 
the time of the nomination, and assist-
ant principal, Mrs. Jennifer Wise, led 
several building initiatives that im-
proved academic performance and emo-
tional growth by investing in profes-
sional development, creating a commu-
nity of learners, and meeting the emo-
tional needs of students. 
The national recognition is also the 
result of the collective efforts of the 
building administration, teachers, sup-
port staff, and the entire Taylorville

congratulate both the Taylorville Jun-
ior High School and its administrators 
and teachers for their commitment and 
dedication to the improvement of pub-
lic education for the students in my 
hometown of Taylorville. 
CONGRATULATING KEN LEONARD ON HIS 400TH 
VICTORY 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate 
my friend, Ken Leonard, on reinforcing 
his Illinois high school football legacy 
by becoming the only coach in Illinois 
history to record 400 wins as a high 
school football coach. 
Ken is currently the head coach at 
the 
dominant 
powerhouse 
Sacred 
Heart-Griffin in Springfield, Illinois. 
This achievement actually adds to 
Coach Leonard’s impressive list of ac-
complishments. 
Ken has held the record for career 
wins in Illinois since 2018 and has led 
the SHG Cyclones to five State cham-
pionships and three State runner-up 
trophies. Coach Leonard holds an over-
all record of 400 wins and 80 losses 
throughout his 42 seasons as a head 
coach. 
Ken began coaching at Sacred Heart- 
Griffin in 1984, and throughout his ten-
ure at SHG, Coach Leonard is credited 
with creating a winning culture and in-
spiring countless young lives. Ken’s 
place in Illinois high school football 
has already been cemented but will for-
ever be cemented more with this vic-
tory. 
Ken, and your entire coaching staff, 
and the SHG community, congratula-
tions on this historic win, and we are 
looking forward to many more.

CRISIS AT LAKE MEAD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today as the water in Lake Mead 
has fallen to record-breaking lows not 
seen since the Hoover Dam was con-
structed. 
Already, Lake Mead has fallen to just 
35 percent of its capacity. And as you 
can see behind me, a bathtub ring tall-
er than the Statue of Liberty sur-
rounds the lake as a reminder of the 
water that was once there. 
This is a crisis that we can fix only 
with new investment and innovative 
solutions, and that is why I am sup-
porting the bipartisan infrastructure 
package and the climate and water in-
vestment provisions of the Build Back 
Better Act. It could not be more clear. 
Nevada is ground zero for the effects of 
climate change, but we also are ground 
zero for the benefits of this historic 
legislation. 
The bipartisan infrastructure pack-
age includes more than $8 billion for 
water infrastructure. This also in-
cludes my water recycling legislation 
that will invest in large-scale water re-
cycling projects to help keep more 
water in Lake Mead for Nevadans. 
There is not a moment to lose. 
The opportunity is here and the time 
to act on climate and act for Nevada’s 
water and future is now. 
f 
PROTECT PARENTS’ RIGHT TO 
SPEAK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in solidarity with students, par-
ents, and teachers seeking a brighter 
academic future. From a student’s ear-
liest days of learning the ABC’s, recog-
nizing shapes and colors, to the mo-
ment they walk across the gymnasium 
floor to receive a high school diploma, 
their school days have been filled with 
learning and exploring, reading, writ-
ing, and math. Or they should be. 
This, however, is not the experience 
of many of our K–12 students, espe-
cially not today. For the last 2 years, 
students, parents, teachers, and school 
administrators have been struggling 
with the global pandemic. COVID–19 
has upended routines, hindered learn-
ing, shuttered schools, and angered 
families. These are real challenges re-
quiring active listening and creative 
solutions. We need parental involve-
ment. We need tutorial advice. We need 
school board engagement. 
Parents are concerned with their 
children’s education, health, safety, 
and well-being. Parents are concerned 
with what their children are learning, 
with what is being taught in the school 
system. Parents want to know that 
when they send their daughter or son 
to school, their children will be safe 
from bullies and predators. Recently, 
unfiltered frustrations have boiled over 
at local school board meetings. 
Mr. Speaker, while I do not and will 
not condone violence, I was stunned to 
hear that part of the Federal response 
to rising parental concern with edu-
cational practices and pending school 
policies was to unleash Federal en-
forcement on vocal moms and dads. 
This is deeply disturbing. 
One particular incident was cited as 
a catalyst for government’s heavy- 
handedness. At the beginning of the 
summer, pictures of a dad tackled to 
the ground and arrested during a 
Loudoun County school board meeting 
surfaced. But what is the story behind 
the headline? 
This dad was protesting a school pol-
icy that would allow biological males 
access to girls’ private facilities. Why? 
Because his 15-year-old daughter was 
raped in the girls’ bathroom at her 
school. The situation was expertly cov-
ered up and ignored by the very people 
responsible for protecting his daughter: 
the school. 
School officials eventually called the 
police, not to report a serious crime 
against a young girl, but to restrain a 
distraught father when he discovered 
the school was attempting to sweep the 
assault under the rug. 
One such horrific rape should be suf-
ficient for every school district to re-
view who has access to girls’ safe 
spaces. Instead, this half-told story was 
crafted into a political narrative alleg-
ing examples akin to domestic ter-
rorism. 
Just a few months after this inci-
dent, a national school association let-
ter demanded that the Federal Govern-
ment respond to unrest, name-calling, 
and protests at school board meetings 
across the U.S. The arrest of this dis-
tressed father whose daughter had been 
raped was one of the examples cited in 
the correspondence to the President as 
a need for Federal intervention. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice validated the concerns 
raised, not by the father or parent 
seeking input into their child’s edu-
cation, but to the dubious claims 
raised by the national association. 
Instead of adhering to the constitu-
tional charge to oversee Federal issues, 
it disturbs me that the power of the 
Federal Government is being wielded 
to bludgeon everyday parents into si-
lence. This must end. 
Whether 
parents 
voice 
concerns 
about a lack of safe spaces for their 
girls, the type of curriculum that is 
taught at every grade level, or mask 
mandates, parents deserve to be heard, 
and every American has a constitu-
tional right to voice these concerns to 
the government without being treated 
like a criminal. 
It is time we start listening to par-
ents. They are the best arbiters of their 
child’s education, and they deserve re-
spect, not contempt. 
f 
FREEDOM TO VOTE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak to the urgency of passing the 
Freedom to Vote Act, which the Senate 
is considering today. 
The events of the past year have ex-
posed the fragility of our democracy, 
and Congress must act now to protect 
that most fundamental of American 
freedoms: the freedom to vote. 
In 2020, we lived through the most 
challenged and scrutinized election in 
American history. But now, even after 
the result is beyond all reasonable de-
bate, radical right-wing extremists and 
would-be dictators are still trying to 
overturn the 2020 election; stoking the 
flames of conspiracy, hate, and chaos 
in order to create a dark and twisted 
vision of America that these agents of 
chaos have embraced. 
Unless Congress acts now, the radical 
right will keep using the big lie told by 
the former President and endorsed by 
his supporters to enact damaging vot-
ing restrictions and prevent Americans 
who have rejected their dark vision for 
our country from participating in our 
representative democracy.

vania, where I live, the majority in our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5685 
October 20, 2021 
State legislature has embraced these 
lies and conspiracy theories about elec-
tion fraud to propose a raft of new laws 
that would make it more difficult for 
eligible voters to actually vote. We 
have an opportunity to put an end to 
these anti-democratic tactics and Con-
gress must seize it. 
Today, the Senate will take a crucial 
vote on the Freedom to Vote Act, im-
portant legislation that is necessary to 
ensure that our government remains 
by the people and for the people, not 
politicians. 
Similar to the For the People Act, 
which the House has passed both this 
term and last, the Freedom to Vote 
Act sets basic nationwide standards for 
how elections are conducted and en-
sures that the voices of everyday 
American voters are heard in Wash-
ington. It will work in tandem with the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act to restore critical protec-
tions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and 
combat racial discrimination in voting. 
Together, these two bills will safeguard 
our democracy from both current and 
future threats. 
Ultimately, the Freedom to Vote Act 
is about ensuring that people, not poli-
ticians, hold the power in our govern-
ment. 
Let’s talk for a moment about what 
this bill is and what it isn’t. The Free-
dom to Vote Act would set national 
standards to protect the freedom to 
vote, end partisan redistricting, ensure 
sound election administration, and fix 
our broken campaign finance system. 
These key provisions are widely sup-
ported by the American people, includ-
ing majorities of Democrats, Repub-
licans, and Independents. People are 
tired of cycles of chaos, followed by in-
action, when it comes to our elections. 
The most basic foundational element 
of our democracy deserves to be treat-
ed with seriousness, urgency, and care. 
We cannot stand by as discriminatory 
voter laws, partisan gerrymandering, 
and dark money drowns out the voices 
of American voters. 
As for what this bill does not do, con-
trary to what some of our colleagues 
across 
the 
aisle—and 
particularly 
MITCH MCCONNELL—have claimed, the 
Freedom to Vote Act is not an uncon-
stitutional power grab. 
Our Founding Fathers may not have 
anticipated all the ways our country 
would change over the centuries and 
the ways in which we would need to 
adapt, but they were really, really good 
in anticipating the evil that men might 
do in pursuit of power, including an-
ticipating efforts to undermine the 
most precious value enshrined in the 
Constitution, the right to a govern-
ment chosen by, for, and of the people. 
One of the ways the Framers did this 
was in Article I, Section 4 of the Con-
stitution, which allowed States, in gen-
eral, to regulate the time, place, and 
manner of elections to Federal offices, 
like Congress, but with a really impor-
tant exception. The second half of that 
section says, ‘‘Congress may at any 
time make or alter such State regula-
tions.’’ 
Why did the Framers do this? Be-
cause they already knew of instances 
in which State legislators might try to 
corrupt the election process in order to 
impact the Federal Government, even 
as they were drafting the Constitution. 
And isn’t that where we are today? 
We have States that are trying to 
make it harder for people who live in 
cities and people of color to vote. We 
have State legislatures proposing to 
overturn the results of the last election 
and future elections if the party in 
power in that State doesn’t like the 
candidate that the people voted for. 
We have State legislatures proposing 
to politicize professional election staff 
and procedures with bills that would 
allow partisan legislatures to over-
throw the Presidential electors chosen 
by the people and substitute electors 
who will vote for another candidate. 
That is why it is so important that 
Congress act to fulfill what may be its 
most sacred obligation under the Con-
stitution to protect the right of the 
American people to chose their own 
representatives 
rather 
than 
letting 
elected officials manipulate that proc-
ess to stay in power. 
If the Senate again fails to fulfill its 
responsibility with the filibuster in-
tact, then it is time for the filibuster 
to go.

INFLATION AND THE SUPPLY 
CHAIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to remind Congress that small busi-
nesses and consumers all over the 
country are feeling the repercussions of 
President Biden’s spending spree. 
It is very simple: President Biden’s 
so-called 
rescue 
plan 
has 
directly 
caused a crisis we are seeing on the 
farm and on Main Street. Injecting $1.9 
trillion of government spending into 
the economy without a clear plan for 
execution has increased costs and dis-
rupted the supply chain. 
All government spending must be 
paid for somehow, and Americans are 
paying for it with inflation. Since Feb-
ruary 2020, the amount of money in the 
economy has grown by over 26 percent, 
so it should come as no surprise that 
Americans are experiencing the high-
est price increases since the Great Re-
cession. Consumer prices for used cars 
and trucks have risen by more than 24 
percent, and costs have increased 11.2 
percent for furniture, 9.6 percent for 
household appliances, 6 percent for 
utilities, and 5.6 percent for clothing. 
President Biden promised to raise 
taxes only on wealthy Americans, but 
these price increases happening under 
his direction are a tax on every Amer-
ican. Inflation-adjusted wages are down 
nearly 2 percent since President Biden 
took office, and with the Democrats 
planning to continue their reckless 
tax-and-spend habits, American fami-
lies can expect the cost of living to 
keep going up. 
As if rising costs weren’t enough, this 
administration’s so-called rescue plan 
has created a labor shortage that is 
weakening our supply chain and leav-
ing manufacturers and business owners 
high and dry. 
Earlier this month, I hosted a manu-
facturing tour across my district in 
Kansas, where I visited small busi-
nesses that produce and sell products 
like highway signs, car accessories, and 
industrial valves. These businesses are 
the driving forces in their commu-
nities, but the leaders who run them 
all painted the same bleak picture: 
Vendor costs are rising; labor is hard 
to come by; and a weakened supply 
chain is slowing everything down. 
The 
Grasshopper 
Company 
in 
Moundridge, Kansas, builds and sells 
mowers and landscaping tools, the 
same ones used by the White House 
groundskeepers. Grasshopper is facing 
longer lead times on vendor items than 
they have ever seen, and the prices on 
raw materials like steel seem to be ris-
ing daily. To meet their customer de-
mand on time, Grasshopper had to pay 
an extra $28,000 air freight fee. Back in 
July, Grasshopper’s disrupted supply 
chain and increased cost of doing busi-
ness forced them to raise the price of 
their goods midseason, something they 
have not had to do since the Carter ad-
ministration. 
Another manufacturing company in 
my district told me that the supply 
chain backlog has made it impossible 
to plan for their future. Their suppliers 
are telling them that essential inputs 
like electronic components will now 
take at least 5 to 6 months before they 
even ship. Before this year, they never 
had to wait longer than 4 weeks. 
Sadly, these are just two examples 
from Kansas’ Big First District. Small 
businesses all over the country are 
being forced to raise their costs due to 
supply chain issues, inflation impact-
ing their own inputs, labor shortages, 
or all the above. 
To 
get 
inflation 
under 
control, 
strengthen the supply chain, and stop 
consumer costs from rising even fur-
ther, we need to get Americans back to 
work, stop the vaccine mandate, quit 
recklessly printing money, and end the 
spending addiction here in Washington. 
SECURING RELEASE AND RETURN OF AMERICAN 
MISSIONARIES IN HAITI 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express the urgent need for the 
Biden administration to secure the re-
lease and return of the 17 American 
missionaries taken captive in Haiti by 
a street gang known for mass kidnap-
ping of religious groups. 
I cannot imagine the terror they are 
experiencing in this very moment as 
we speak. We cannot sit idly by while 
they fear for their lives.

government aid and nongovernment or-
ganizations like Christian Aid Min-
istries. I urge President Biden and this 
administration to leverage our rela-
tionship with the Haitian Government 
to secure the safe return of every mem-
ber of this group. 
The captivity of Americans, whether 
in Port-au-Prince, Kabul, or anywhere 
else, is an international crisis. Presi-
dent Biden’s actions in this moment 
are assuredly being watched by those 
who would not hesitate to do our coun-
try harm and could have longstanding 
repercussions for Americans practicing 
their faith across the globe. 
The United States must be clear: If 
you capture our citizens, our govern-
ment will respond swiftly and deci-
sively. 
f 
EXTENDING CHILD TAX CREDIT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. School 
supplies, gas for the car, swimming les-
sons, payment for rent, these are just a 
few of the ways my constituents in 
southeast Louisiana are spending their 
child tax credit payments. Especially 
as my community recovers from Hurri-
cane Ida and has unexpected costs, the 
dependability of monthly child tax 
credits—an average of $410 for my con-
stituents—has meant a lot. 
While this program expires at the end 
of 
December, 
the 
problems 
facing 
American children and families will 
not. The Build Back Better Act in-
cludes provisions to continue this pro-
gram. 
Studies show that extending the 
child tax credit permanently is sound 
economic policy and that it can be 
done better to have better healthcare, 
better health outcomes, and more eco-
nomic opportunities for families. 
We need to put our money where our 
mouth is and invest in our children, in-
vest in our families, and pass the Build 
Back Better Act. 
REMEMBERING MUSICIAN BENNIE PETE 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, COVID–19 has taken over 
725,000 lives. One person gone too soon 
that I want to highlight is Bennie Pete, 
a New Orleans jazz musician. He passed 
away at the age of 45 from complica-
tions of COVID–19, shortly after decid-
ing to get his first vaccine shot. 
Bennie played the tuba and co-
founded the celebrated Hot 8 Brass 
Band. Born in the Upper Ninth Ward, 
he helped found the band by the age of 
18. They played on street corners, pa-
rades, and funerals, and then at bars 
and bigger venues, and as second lines. 
When Hurricane Katrina hit, Hot 8 
brought music to the city in a way that 
only New Orleans can in the chal-
lenging days after the storm, playing 
at evacuation shelters and medical 
centers. The band became local heroes, 
a sense of hope, a sense of energy in the 
days immediately following great de-
spair. 
The Hot 8 grew in popularity, touring 
in Europe and playing at Tipitina’s and 
the Jazz and Heritage Festival. 
New Orleans will never be the same. 
We have lost a little bit of our soul 
with the passing of Bennie Pete. May 
he rest in peace. 
IMPROVING LOUISIANA’S ENVIRONMENT AND 
INDUSTRY 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, Louisiana’s Second Congres-
sional District includes an industrial 
corridor of nearly 150 oil refineries, 
plastic plants, and chemical facilities. 
Many sites provide high-paying jobs 
that lift families out of poverty or 
build a better life. But it is, foremost, 
a place that my constituents call 
home. 
As their Congressman, it is my job to 
make sure that it is a safe and pros-
perous place to live. Sadly, there have 
been longstanding concerns over ele-
vated and disproportionate rates of 
cancer and respiratory conditions in 
this region. It shouldn’t be this way. 
Industry and community can coexist, 
with proper monitoring and regulation. 
That is why I am calling on EPA Ad-
ministrator Regan for Federal assist-
ance to study, monitor, and improve 
the impacts of emissions and polluting 
substances in the river parishes. No 
one should have to die for their job. 
I stand ready to bring both environ-
mental stewardship and a robust econ-
omy to Louisiana. We can do this. We 
must do this.

RECOGNIZING BRAS FOR A CAUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize October as 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
As a physician, and also as a member 
of our society and country and the fe-
male gender, we are all familiar with 
the amazing work the Komen Founda-
tion and Komen Race for the Cure have 
done to raise awareness, education, and 
research in breast cancer. 
I would like to take the time to rec-
ognize an extraordinary group in my 
district that has found a creative way 
to help underserved women in the 
Ottumwa community receive annual 
mammogram screenings and breast 
ultrasounds. 
Founded in 2011 by two-time breast 
cancer survivor and River Hills Com-
munity Health Center nurse Laurie 
Hornback, Bras for a Cause is an an-
nual fundraising event held in Hedrick, 
Iowa, where donated and decorated 
bras are modeled by local firefighters 
and auctioned off. Over the past 10 
years, the event has raised a total of 
$174,000 to help women receive breast 
cancer screenings or treatment. 
This year, Bras for a Cause raised a 
total of $27,000, and they will be donat-
ing $15,000 to help Ottumwa women re-
ceive breast cancer screenings at River 
Hills Community Health Center in 
Ottumwa. Additionally, a portion of 
the remaining funds was donated to the 
Mahaska Health Partnership, while the 
rest is being saved to help women cur-
rently diagnosed with breast cancer 
undergo treatment. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Laurie and Bras 
for a Cause for coming together to put 
on this fantastic event and for their 
service to our community. 
RECOGNIZING SARA RUSSELL, IOWA TEACHER OF 
THE YEAR 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize a teacher from 
my district who recently received a 
prestigious Iowa award for her work to 
inspire the next generation. 
Last week, Sara Russell, who has 
been teaching social studies for nearly 
20 years at Pleasant Valley High 
School in Bettendorf, was awarded the 
Department of Education’s 2022 Teach-
er of the Year Award by Governor Kim 
Reynolds. 
The Iowa Teacher of the Year Award 
was established in 1958 to recognize 
educators who go above and beyond to 
motivate 
and 
inspire 
students 
to 
achieve at their highest levels. 
Sara was selected for this award for 
her leadership in helping students build 
life skills while also being a mentor for 
new teachers in the Pleasant Valley 
School District. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Sara and all 
educators who work to inspire the next 
generation of American leaders and 
make Iowa the best place to learn, live, 
work, and raise a family. 
RECOGNIZING ERIC VANDER VELDEN 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I rise to share a story about edu-
cators in my district literally going 
the extra mile to ensure their students’ 
success. 
For the last few months, the Newton 
School District in Jasper County has 
reported a shortage of bus drivers, 
leaving many parents and students un-
certain about how they would be able 
to make it to school each morning. In 
a rural area, our bus transportation to 
school is extremely important. 
With the importance of education 
and 
safety 
in 
mind, 
Eric 
Vander 
Velden, a physical education teacher in 
the Newton School District, answered 
the call for help by driving a school bus 
when needed. This is part of a larger ef-
fort by the Newton staff, in concert 
with parents, to do whatever they can 
to help their students succeed. 
It is stories like these that remind us 
that our teachers are the backbone of 
this country, and I couldn’t be more 
confident in our future, knowing that 
the next generation is in their capable 
hands.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5687 
October 20, 2021 
Strayer Nelson of Ilion, New York, who 
turns 100 years old today. 
Mr. Nelson is one of the last living 
survivors of the attack on Pearl Har-
bor. He joined the Navy right out of 
high school and was assigned to the 
USS Wasmuth, a Clemson-class de-
stroyer that was docked in Pearl Har-
bor on December 7, 1941. He left the 
Navy as a first class electrician’s mate. 
On that fateful day 80 years ago, 19- 
year-old Thomas Strayer Nelson was 
lying in his bunk aboard the ship 
docked in Pearl Harbor when the 
alarms sounded. Sensing trouble, Tom 
made it topside where he saw several 
Japanese planes bombing American 
ships. He quickly assessed that this 
was not a drill. 
Tom quickly jumped on his .50 cal-
iber machine gun and successfully 
helped defend the Wasmuth and its crew 
on that fateful day. 
The wreckage was devastating. Near-
ly 20 U.S. ships were damaged or sank 
at sea, and more than 2,400 Americans, 
including civilians, were killed. 
Tom remembers crying that day dur-
ing the aftermath, but Tom’s heroism 
did not stop there. Nearly 1 year later, 
in December 1942, the Wasmuth was es-
corting a convoy when it was knocked 
off its tracks and two mines exploded 
below the ship. The Wasmuth sank, but 
134 crew, including Tom, were rescued 
due in large part to Tom’s efforts. 
Tom came back home and was an 
electrical inspector for over 27 years in 
his hometown of Ilion, New York, 
where he has resided for nearly his en-
tire life. I had the great honor of meet-
ing Tom this past weekend. At the age 
of 99, now 100 today, he was full of life 
and very engaging, and he also had a 
wonderful sense of humor. I also had 
the pleasure of meeting his daughter, 
Janice, with whom he has been living 
the past 2 years and who provides great 
care for him, and his son, John, who is 
also providing loving care to Tom. 
John is a former State trooper who has 
now taken on the mantle of also being 
an electrician in his father’s legacy. 
b 1115 
I just want to say also about the 
wonderful family from this small com-
munity, 
Tom’s 
late 
wife, 
Gladys 
Cooley, passed away in 2015. He also 
had a daughter who passed away and a 
son, Tom, who died very young from 
rheumatoid arthritis. 
I just wanted to take this special 
time to recognize and thank someone 
who is part of our Greatest Generation 
from my community, one of the last 
survivors of Pearl Harbor who actually 
was there when this occurred. I want to 
thank his family and everyone for 
hosting me, greeting me, and giving me 
the real unique opportunity to meet 
with this great hero of our country. 
I want to say thank you again to 
Tom for his heroism, his service, and 
his bravery. I wish him another 100 
years of good health and good cheer. I 
look forward to seeing him again when 
I return to my hometown. 
Here’s to many years ahead. 
f 
ENERGY CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, our Nation 
is facing avoidable crises on many 
fronts. Because of President Biden’s 
and the Democrats’ failed leadership, 
Americans are dealing with a border 
crisis, an inflation crisis, a spreading 
crime crisis, and a crisis in Afghani-
stan. And now, with the national aver-
age for a gallon of gas hitting $3.30 last 
week—a 7-year high—we are also facing 
an energy crisis. 
Let me be clear: the responsibility 
for this crisis belongs at the feet of 
none other than President Joe Biden. 
His anti-energy agenda has destroyed 
American jobs and ended America’s en-
ergy independence. On his first day in 
office, the President killed 11,000 jobs 
by canceling the Keystone pipeline, 
and one of his first executive orders 
paused new oil and gas leasing on U.S. 
lands and waters. That executive order 
alone will cost approximately 1 million 
American jobs in the near term and 
will decrease U.S. gross domestic prod-
uct by $700 billion. 
That same order also puts America’s 
energy security at risk. To make up for 
slowed 
production 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
U.S. 
imports 
from 
foreign 
sources will increase by 2 million bar-
rels a day, and through 2030 we would 
spend $500 billion more on energy from 
foreign suppliers. Instead of making it 
easier for American companies to in-
crease American oil and gas production 
and hire more U.S. workers, President 
Biden begged OPEC and Russia to in-
crease global output to ease rising 
prices. 
It is a shame. The President has 
made us more reliant on dangerous ad-
versaries overseas rather than main-
taining policies that had us on the 
verge of energy independence. 
It would be great if Joe Biden would 
reverse course and turn, once again, to 
an all-of-the-above American energy 
solution that ensures we are reliant on 
no one but ourselves; but, instead, I 
guess we are just going to have to 
lower our expectations. 
f 
A CRUEL CHOICE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, forc-
ing 
the 
Federal 
Government 
into 
Americans’ private lives is Joe Biden’s 
twisted idea of unity. It is sickening to 
me that this President is creating a 
situation where some Americans need 
to pick between keeping their jobs or 
taking the coronavirus vaccine. 
This is a cruel way to treat Ameri-
cans trying to earn a living. Even 
worse, Biden’s vaccine mandate applies 
to brave military soldiers willing to die 
for us, Federal contractors, and the in-
telligence community. If too many are 
forced out of their positions, it will 
jeopardize America’s ability to assess 
and address threats. 
Mr. Speaker, you do not need to look 
very hard for possible consequences. 
Over the weekend, our government’s 
top intelligence personnel were caught 
off guard by the People’s Liberation 
Army’s test of a hypersonic missile ca-
pable of traveling at 25,000 miles per 
hour. Imagine that missile flying to-
ward the homeland and important gov-
ernment or military roles were vacant 
because folks were fired over the vac-
cine. 
Mr. Speaker, the result would be cat-
astrophic. 
Biden needs to back off his tyran-
nical impulses and allow Americans to 
decide 
for 
themselves 
on 
the 
coronavirus vaccine. If he doesn’t, tal-
ented folks are going to exit critical 
national 
security 
jobs, 
and 
this 
clueless President will blunder his way 
into yet another crisis. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, Heaven and Earth are held 
in Your hand. You who have deter-
mined the number of stars and given 
each their name, You who have set the 
Pleiades and Orion in the sky, You are 
our North Star, the constant in this 
changing universe, and we look to You 
for direction. 
Cast our eyes upon Your brightness, 
that we would discover the immuta-
bility of Your character and revive our 
strength. In a world full of variables, 
may Your unchanging nature ever be 
our guard and stay. 
When there is no one on whom we 
can rely, may we rely on You. 
When there is nothing we can trust, 
may we trust You. 
When we are lost, adrift in the sea of 
confusion, may we anchor ourselves in 
You. 
And when we are fearful for our lives 
or livelihood, may You be our source of 
courage and purpose.

IT IS TIME TO ACT FOR ALS 
(Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in unity with Americans suf-
fering from ALS and their families, 
who are desperate for effective treat-
ments and, one day, a cure. 
I made it my mission to pass the ACT 
for ALS Act because people with ALS 
deserve a chance to fight the disease. 
They deserve a research and develop-
ment infrastructure that is compas-
sionate today while looking to the fu-
ture. 
My friend, Brian Wallach, who was 
diagnosed with ALS 4 years ago, told 
Congress that this fight is the closing 
argument for his life. I can’t look him 
in the eye and tell him we have to 
wait. None of us should. 
I am profoundly grateful to each and 
every one of the 325 cosponsors of this 
bill, as are families impacted by ALS 
all around the country. This is the 
most cosponsors of any bill that has 
not yet gotten a vote in this Congress. 
It is time for us to act. It is time to 
act for ALS. 
f 
AMERICA HAS SERIOUS FISCAL 
PROBLEMS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the September 21 Post and 
Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, 
editorialized an analysis of the irre-
sponsible 
Biden 
tax-and-borrow 
schemes destroying jobs. 
What would you call a neighbor who spent 
lavishly to redecorate his house but ignored 
the badly leaking roof? Perhaps foolish, irra-
tional, or just plain dumb. 
Now, what would you call a Congress seem-
ingly bent on enacting costly new middle- 
class entitlements while existing programs 
are headed for devastating benefit cuts? 
Some of those same words come to mind. 
At the end of August, the Treasury Depart-
ment issued the annual reports of the trust-
ees for Social Security and Medicare that 
showed these trust fund programs are on 
schedule to run out of money. 
There are very serious fiscal problems, but 
Congress instead is focusing on legislation to 
expand entitlements, hurting their children 
in the long run while millions of our elderly 
could be thrown into poverty. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from Afghanistan to 
America. Our sympathy to the family 
of General Colin Powell. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF KEVIN HAYS 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to honor the life and 
legacy of Kevin Hays. 
Kevin was diagnosed with colorectal 
cancer at the age of 28. He fought a 7- 
year battle against it that was coura-
geous and inspiring. He made it his 
mission to raise awareness about the 
second leading cause of cancer deaths 
in America. 
Kevin founded the Colon Corps, led 
the Blue Hope Hard Hat Initiative, and 
got involved with the American Cancer 
Society and the National Colorectal 
Cancer Alliance to promote early de-
tection and screening. 
Kevin was a gifted, nationally recog-
nized messenger, charismatic and kind, 
with a mischievous smile and a great 
sense of humor. 
To his beloved wife, Hilary, and his 
beautiful family and loved ones, cher-
ish your memories of Kevin and know 
that there will always be light to guide 
you from the love he gave you. 
I stand here today to recognize the 
many lives saved thanks to the advo-
cacy of Kevin Hays and to carry his 
message of love and encouraging colon 
cancer screening forward. 
f 
DEMOCRATS’ RADICAL AND 
COSTLY POLICIES 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, President Biden and Democrats are 
pushing to pass a multitrillion-dollar 
socialist spending agenda that would 
be the largest tax-and-spending in-
crease in our Nation’s history. It is, 
frankly, money we don’t have. 
At a time when families and busi-
nesses are struggling to deal with 
President Biden’s reckless economic 
policies, the Democrats are pushing to 
spend trillions more dollars to fund 
their radical, socialistic, and costly 
policies. 
Just a few of the Democrats’ far-left 
socialist policies will hit small busi-
ness with a larger tax bill, impose cost-
ly Green New Deal mandates that sim-
ply won’t work, increase our energy de-
pendency 
on 
Russia 
and 
China, 
weaponize the IRS to target American 
families and monitor $600 per week 
bank transactions. 
I will continue to stand against the 
Democrats’ socialistic tax-and-spend 
spree that will limit our freedoms, 
make our country less competitive, 
and destroy Main Street America. 
Their agenda is anti-American. 
In God we trust. 
f 
FUNDING ELECTRIC VEHICLES 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, we have a choice. 
We can work to save our planet and be-
come a global leader in green tech-
nology, or we can allow our planet to 
become uninhabitable. We must choose 
to protect our planet, the only home 
we have. 
Transitioning to electric vehicles 
will dramatically reduce carbon emis-
sions and will create a cleaner world 
for our children. That is why my com-
mittee approved billions of dollars to 
transition the Postal Service and GSA 
fleets to electric vehicles and provide 
the necessary charging infrastructure 
across the country in the postal offices. 
This will fund more than 300,000 elec-
tric vehicles. That is more electric ve-
hicles than were sold across the entire 
country last year. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Build Back Better plan, which includes 
funding for electric vehicles that will 
greatly help our environment. 
f 
MY CONSTITUENTS MISS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, Americans miss President Donald 
Trump. 
Under the Biden administration, we 
have a supply chain crisis, an energy 
crisis, a border crisis, an Afghanistan 
crisis, and an economic crisis that 
threatens every bank account and pay-
check that we earn. 
Americans are scared and losing hope 
after 9 months of the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration. 
Under President Trump, we had a 
roaring economy; we had energy inde-
pendence; our border was secure; and 
our enemies feared our resolve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5689 
October 20, 2021 
The radical left is attempting to de-
stroy our economy and the American 
way of life, but every crisis created by 
the Biden administration is only a re-
minder of how great it was to have an 
American President who put America 
first. 
Today marks 9 months of the Biden 
administration, and my constituents 
miss President Trump now more than 
ever. 
f 
TURBOCHARGE THE CLEAN 
ENERGY ECONOMY 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Build Back 
Better agenda. We have a once-in-a- 
generation opportunity to address cli-
mate change, and we must pass the 
clean electricity performance program, 
which uses a novel carrot-and-stick ap-
proach to reduce emissions by State 
utilities. 
I further support instituting a carbon 
tax, which would make corporations 
pay for their harmful pollution and en-
sure our planet remains habitable for 
our children. 
Furthermore, as we invest in clean 
energy infrastructure to replace harm-
ful fossil fuels, we must end the Trump 
tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese 
goods. These tariffs artificially in-
crease the cost of materials in solar 
panels, wind turbines, and other prod-
ucts we need to power our economy 
with clean energy. 
Together, we can enact President 
Biden’s agenda to turbocharge the 
clean energy economy and create good 
jobs. 
f 
ONGOING CRISIS AT OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to address the ongoing cri-
sis at the southern border. The Biden 
administration has actively opened the 
border, and it is directly harming our 
country by dwindling resources, endan-
gering communities, and emboldening 
terror threats. 
I recently visited the Del Rio, Texas, 
sector to hear straight from our Cus-
toms and Border Patrol agents, Texas 
National Guard, and Texas State troop-
ers. In just one station within the sec-
tor, apprehensions have multiplied at 
an alarming rate, going from 7,400 last 
year to more than 94,000 in 2021, and 
agents have detained people from more 
than 90 countries. 
While the humanitarian aspect of 
this crisis is disturbing, I am more con-
cerned with the growing national secu-
rity threats to our country. Nearly 
10,000 individuals with criminal convic-
tions have been arrested in fiscal year 
2021 attempting to illegally cross into 
the U.S., compared to just 2,400 last 
year. 
Mr. Speaker, securing and regulating 
our border is crucial in keeping our 
country secure, functioning, and, most 
importantly, 
safe 
from 
external 
threats. I urge my colleagues to work 
toward creating meaningful legislation 
to provide Customs and Border Patrol 
agents with much-needed resources to 
firmly protect our border. 
f 
CONGRATULATING TRIG AND 
TULA SOLBERG 
(Mr. TIFFANY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Trig Solberg and 
his wife, Tula, on the 50th anniversary 
of their business, T.A. Solberg Com-
pany, which operates several super-
markets and fuel and convenience 
stores throughout northern and central 
Wisconsin. 
Trig and Tula started their first busi-
ness together in 1971, with a single 
small store in Land O’Lakes, Wis-
consin. Today, they operate several 
stores 
in 
the 
communities 
of 
Rhinelander, Minocqua, Eagle River, 
and Tomahawk, employing more than 
1,200 people. The Northwoods of Wis-
consin is dear to the Solbergs, so they 
make sure each of their stores keeps 
the personality of the region intact. 
I can attest that Trig is admired by 
staff, colleagues, and industry peers for 
his dedication to his community and 
commitment to excellence. 
Congratulations again to Trig and 
Tula Solberg for 50 years in business 
and their service to Wisconsin.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
GREENVILLE, 
SOUTH 
CAROLINA 
FOOTHILLS 
CHAPTER OF THE KOREAN WAR 
VETERANS ASSOCIATION 
(Mr. TIMMONS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
before you today to recognize the 
Greenville, South Carolina Foothills 
Chapter of the Korean War Veterans 
Association for their exemplary work 
to ensure that all of South Carolina’s 
fallen Korean war veterans are never 
forgotten. 
In 2016, Congress enacted legislation 
that authorized the Wall of Remem-
brance as an addition to the Korean 
War Memorial, but they didn’t fund the 
project. In response, the Foothills 
Chapter made it their mission to raise 
nearly $20,000 to cover the inscription 
costs of the 55 soldiers from Greenville 
County who died in combat during 
America’s ‘‘forgotten war.’’ 
After 4 tireless years, the Foothills 
Chapter 
recently 
announced 
they 
raised $207,000, which is enough to pro-
vide inscriptions, not only for the 55 
soldiers from Greenville County, but 
for all 483 servicemembers from South 
Carolina who were killed while serving 
their country in Korea, as well as 93 
servicemembers who were captured and 
held as prisoners of war. 
Once again, I recognize the Green-
ville Foothills Chapter of the Korean 
War Veterans Association and, in par-
ticular, my friend, former State sen-
ator Lewis Vaughn for carrying on the 
legacy of South Carolinians who made 
the ultimate sacrifice in Korea. 
f 
REPORT ON THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we 
had another week go by, and I didn’t 
see the Vice President in charge of the 
Mexican border policy for this adminis-
tration down there, so I felt I should go 
down and look around in the Yuma sec-
tor and report back to her or anybody 
in the majority party who wants to 
hear. 
These are the things that I don’t 
think we have seen in the papers. I 
could talk for hours. 
One thing, a large number of the peo-
ple crossing the border in the Yuma 
sector are throwing away their IDs on 
the ground. And if you want, you can 
just stand there along the paths and 
see all the IDs that are just lying 
there. 
You have to ask yourself, why, if I 
am an immigrant, am I throwing away 
my ID before I check in with Border 
Patrol? I must be hiding something. It 
means that they can’t do a background 
check if I was in the United States in 
the past, or, for that matter, there is 
going to be no record of when such and 
such a person left Colombia and comes 
into the United States. We should re-
quire an ID to come here. We should no 
longer let people throw them out. 
Secondly, I, in the past, am under the 
impression that people can test posi-
tive for COVID, check into a hotel and 
just leave and come into the country. I 
now know they do not require tests. 
These are two more things I learned 
at the border. I invite the Vice Presi-
dent to go down there.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from

and the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
H.R. 1508 would require Federal agen-
cies to include a guidance clarity 
statement on the first page of guidance 
documents. 
I thank Representative LUETKEMEYER 
and Ranking Member COMER for work-
ing with us to perfect this bill. 
Federal rules, regulations, and guid-
ance are complex, even at the best of 
times. 
For most Americans who do not 
spend hours per day reading through 
the Federal Register, guidance docu-
ments can be very confusing. 
This simple, good government bill 
will help clarify for the public that 
agency guidance is intended to help 
guide the implementation of Federal 
regulations, not to act as additional le-
gally binding rules. 
This is a bipartisan bill in both the 
House and the Senate, which passed a 
Senate companion out of committee by 
voice vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, agency guidance serves 
an important function in the Federal 
regulatory system. 
Agency guidance helps regulated par-
ties and the public understand how 
agencies will interpret the laws and ad-
minister their programs. 
However, agency guidance can be— 
and has been—abused. 
For example, agencies can use guid-
ance documents to intimidate small 
businesses and individuals into compli-
ance with agency views, sometimes 
under the threat of enforcement ac-
tion. 
Small businesses and ordinary indi-
viduals often do not have the legal re-
sources or necessary background to un-
derstand when an agency statement is 
binding law. 
It can be difficult for them to deter-
mine what agency statements must be 
complied with versus what is merely a 
nonbinding description of an agency’s 
views on which they can push back. 
Agencies have been known to try to 
start enforcement actions based on 
mere guidance. 
Agencies also have been known to at-
tempt to issue binding rules by quietly 
slipping what they intend to be rules in 
guidance documents. 
This clearly bypasses the Adminis-
trative Procedure Act’s requirements 
that were put in place to protect regu-
lated individuals and small businesses. 
The courts coined the term ‘‘nonrule 
rule’’ to describe this Big Government 
sleight of hand. 
And the courts have rightly struck 
down such rules that only appeared in 
agency guidance. 
The Guidance Clarity Act offers a 
simple solution to these problems. 
It requires agency guidance docu-
ments to include the following explicit 
statement: ‘‘The contents of this docu-
ment do not have the force and effect 
of law and do not, of themselves, bind 
the public or the agency. 
‘‘This document is intended only to 
provide clarity to the public regarding 
existing requirements under the law or 
agency policies.’’ 
With that stroke of the pen, gone will 
be the days in which agencies can use 
guidance documents to force small 
businesses and individuals to comply 
with nonbinding agency views. 
Gone, too, will be the days of agen-
cies trying to issue nonrule rules that 
bypass the Administrative Procedure 
Act’s requirement for legislative rules. 
I thank the sponsor of the bill, the 
ranking member of the Small Business 
Committee, BLAINE LUETKEMEYER, who 
has worked tirelessly on this bill since 
it was first introduced. 
I thank Chairwoman MALONEY
for 
her speedy efforts to help make passage 
of this bill a bipartisan success. 
And I also thank Senator JAMES 
LANKFORD and Senate Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs Chair-
man GARY PETERS for their critical ef-
forts to achieve a bipartisan com-
promise on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER). 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of my bill, the Guidance 
Clarity Act. 
The Federal Government produces 
hundreds of rules, regulations, and 
laws every year. Without the help of 
legal teams and consultants, individ-
uals and small businesses cannot pos-
sibly keep up with everything that is 
coming out of Washington. 
The purpose of guidance is to assist 
those 
Americans 
in 
understanding 
rules and regulations and give them 
suggestions on how to adhere to them. 
Guidance is not approved by Con-
gress, nor does it go through the Fed-
eral rulemaking process which allows 
for public input and legal scrutiny of 
agency actions. Guidance is not backed 
up by law, nor is it enforceable by law 
enforcement. It is, quite simply, a sug-
gestion. 
Unfortunately, in past years, many 
regulators have threatened punitive ac-
tion against businesses for not fol-
lowing guidance. That is unacceptable, 
and quite frankly, it is illegal. 
To be clear, I am not talking about 
businesses breaking the law or ignoring 
Federal regulations. Guidance docu-
ments are meant to clarify or to in-
form the public about policy topics and 
are not legally binding. Small busi-
nesses deserve clarity on what docu-
ments are legally binding and should 
not be punished for deviating from 
guidance documents. 
Regulators have no legal authority 
to enforce guidance, and any attempt 
to do so is an egregious abuse of power. 
On top of that, with thousands of 
guidance documents being produced, 
instead of achieving their intended 
goal—which is to provide clarity—they 
are causing even more confusion. 
With some regulators enforcing guid-
ance while others do not, small busi-
nesses and entrepreneurs are driven 
deeper into the regulatory maze of the 
Federal Government. 
My bill is a very simple fix to that 
confusion. The Guidance Clarity Act

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5691 
October 20, 2021 
ensures the first page of guidance docu-
ments includes the plain language 
statement declaring that guidance is 
not law, nor can it legally be enforced 
as law. 
This small but critical statement 
clarifies for citizens and regulators on 
the ground that guidance is meant to 
be helpful; a suggestion that can be put 
in place or completely ignored. It will 
help regulators do their jobs more effi-
ciently and small businesses, who lack 
the resources to employ teams of law-
yers, continue to create jobs and grow 
the economy. 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle will agree that American 
small businesses have enough to worry 
about. They are working hard to keep 
their employees paid and their cus-
tomers happy. They don’t have time to 
worry about keeping track of and abid-
ing by agency suggestions that were 
never meant to be anything more than 
just that. 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
MALONEY, 
Ranking Member COMER, and the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. LATURNER) 
for their leadership in supporting the 
bill and bringing it to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote in favor of the Guid-
ance Clarity Act. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, thanks 
to the Guidance Clarity Act, small 
business owners and individuals across 
the country will soon have confidence 
that agency guidance, however helpful 
and clarifying it may be, is not legally 
binding. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this necessary bipartisan legis-
lation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 1508. 
I thank BLAINE LUETKEMEYER for his 
leadership on this bill and the coopera-
tion of Ranking Member COMER and all 
the teams on both sides working in

Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this

H.R. 1508, as amended.

consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-

There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such

I am pleased to join my colleagues in 
support of H.R. 1170 to designate the fa-
cility of the United States Postal Serv-
ice at 1 League in Irvine, California, as 
the 
‘‘Tuskegee 
Airman 
Lieutenant 
Colonel Robert J. Friend Memorial 
Post Office Building’’. 
Before passing away in June of 2019, 
Lieutenant Colonel Friend was one of 
the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen 
who took to the skies during World 
War II as the first African American 
military aviators. 
The roughly 1,000 Tuskegee Airmen 
flew 15,000 combat sorties, destroyed 
260 enemy aircrafts, and received 150 
decorations of the Flying Cross and Le-
gion 
of 
Merit, 
fighting 
the 
Nazi 
Luftwaffe while simultaneously strik-
ing a blow against racism back home. 
Lieutenant Colonel Friend flew fight-
er aircrafts for nearly 2 years during 
the war. During Lieutenant Colonel 
Friend’s 142 combat missions, he de-
stroyed critical Nazi and Axis power 
military assets, helping move the U.S. 
and ally forces towards victory during 
the war. 
In 
addition, 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Friend served in strategic roles as an 
operations officer for the 301st Squad-
ron and was the final operations officer 
of the 332nd Fighter Group. Lieutenant 
Colonel Friend also served honorably 
in Korea and Vietnam. 
Lieutenant Colonel Friend was the 
recipient of multiple military awards 
for 
service, 
including 
the: 
Distin-
guished Flying Cross, Presidential Unit 
Citation, Bronze Star with Flying 
Cross, 
three 
Distinguished 
Service 
Medals, and an Air Medal. In addition, 
Lieutenant Colonel Friend and his fel-
low Tuskegee Airmen were awarded the 
Congressional Gold Medal in 2007. 
Following the war, Lieutenant Colo-
nel Friend studied astrophysics at the 
Air Force Institute of Technology and 
business at the University of California 
in Los Angeles. After retiring from the 
Air Force in 1971, he worked as a con-
sultant on the development of missile 
systems and space-station components 
near his home in Irvine, California. 
Naming a post office for Tuskegee 
Airman Lieutenant Colonel Friend is 
entirely appropriate given his distin-
guished, extraordinary contributions 
to his State and country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1170, which would name a post 
office after Lieutenant Colonel Robert 
J. Friend, one of the last surviving 
Tuskegee Airmen. 
Lieutenant Colonel Friend was a 
fighter pilot for 2 years during World 
War II, and destroyed critical Nazi 
military assets, bolstering the United 
States. He also served in Korea and 
Vietnam. 
After retiring from the military, he 
studied astrophysics and business at 
the University of California, Los Ange-
les. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much 
time as she may consume to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. POR-
TER), the distinguished chair of the 
Subcommittee on Oversight and Inves-
tigations of the Committee on Natural 
Resources. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for recognizing me. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1170, which will designate the 
post office located at 1 League in 
Irvine, California, as the Tuskegee Air-
man Lieutenant Colonel Robert J. 
Friend Memorial Post Office Building. 
I introduced this bill to honor the 
legacy of a true Orange County hero, 
Lieutenant Colonel Robert J. Friend.

Lieutenant Colonel Friend was one of 
the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include mate-
rials on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3210 to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 1905 15th Street in Boulder, 
Colorado, as the ‘‘Officer Eric H. Talley 
Post Office Building’’. 
Officer Talley joined the Boulder Po-
lice Department in 2010 and served the 
community for 11 years before being 
tragically shot and killed at a Boulder 
King Soopers grocery store on March 
22, 2021, at the age of 51. 
Officer Talley was the first officer to 
arrive at the scene and was one of ten 
individuals who were killed that day. 
He gave his life protecting others and 
his sacrifice and intervention undoubt-
edly saved lives during that horrible 
tragedy. 
Officer Talley was recently post-
humously awarded the Medal of Honor 
by the Boulder Police Department, the 
department’s highest honor, for his he-
roic actions and sacrifice. 
He was born in Houston, Texas, grad-
uated high school in Albuquerque, New 
Mexico, and earned a master’s degree 
in computer science from Ball State 
University in Indiana. 
Before joining the Boulder Police De-
partment, Officer Talley worked in in-
formation technology, but at the age of 
40 he felt a higher calling to switch ca-
reer paths and join law enforcement 
after the tragic death of a friend. 
In 2013, while serving as a police offi-
cer, he made local news when he waded 
into a drainage ditch to rescue a moth-
er duck and her ducklings that were 
trapped in the ditch. Officer Talley was 
one of the first officers to join the 
Boulder Police Department’s drone 
team in 2017 where he worked with new 
technologies to find ways to improve 
public safety and keep police officers 
safe. 
His colleagues, friends, and family 
describe Officer Talley as a man who 
worked as hard as he could to make a 
difference in the lives of others every 
single day. He exemplified selflessness 
in life and in his final act. 
A beloved husband and father of 
seven, Officer Talley was known for his 
kindness, compassion, and love for his 
family. He enjoyed board games, fly 
fishing, golfing, and had a black belt in 
karate. 
Naming a post office for Officer Eric 
Talley is an appropriate way to honor 
his distinguished career and contribu-
tions to his State and country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill to name a post office in Boulder, 
Colorado after Officer Eric Talley. Offi-
cer Talley served as a police officer in 
Boulder for 11 years before being killed 
during a mass shooting at a local gro-
cery store, King Soopers, in Boulder, 
Colorado, on March 25, 2021. 
Officer Talley was the first police of-
ficer to arrive at the scene, and one of 
ten individuals who would be killed 
that day. He left behind a wife and 
seven children, who our hearts go out 
to. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill in 
honor of an American hero, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, because of time 
constraints and scheduling problems, 
the gentleman from New York has a 
bill coming up but he must get to a 
vote and other things, so he has asked 
to speak now. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. SEAN
PATRICK 
MALONEY), distinguished chair of the 
Congressional LGBTQ plus Equality 
Caucus. 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of 
New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend and colleague from New York for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on my 
bill, H.R. 767. It honors the life of the 
late Congressman Benjamin A. Gilman. 
It enshrines his storied career in public 
service at the Fulton Street Post Office 
in Middletown, New York. Ben Gilman 
was a true statesman and a tireless 
representative to the people of the 
Hudson Valley. 
Mr. Speaker, when I was first elected, 
I was told I should try to be like Ben, 
to try to fill the shoes of this giant and

carry on his great tradition of public 
service and delivering results. 
Ben was nothing less than an Amer-
ican patriot. He was born in Pough-
keepsie in 1922. He served in the Army 
Air Corps in World War II. He flew 35 
combat 
missions 
over 
Japan 
and 
earned the Distinguished Flying Cross. 
After the war, he graduated from the 
Wharton School and from New York 
Law School. He went on to be an as-
sistant New York attorney general in 
the 1950s, a lawyer in private practice, 
and then found a calling in public serv-
ice as a New York assemblyman from 
1966 to 1972, and, of course, became my 
community’s representative in Con-
gress for the next 30 years after that. 
He was often called ‘‘Gentle Ben’’ be-
cause of his remarkable humility. And 
because he elevated constituent service 
to an art form, Ben was beloved 
throughout my district, never missing 
a pancake breakfast with farmers or 
firefighters. But as chairman of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, he was 
known on the world stage and deeply 
respected by allies and adversaries 
alike. 
He was called a moderate then, but 
that just meant he rose above the fray 
and political parties and did the right 
thing, always putting his people first. 
Above all, of course, he was a father 
and a husband, and he loved his family. 
We pray for his widow, Georgia, even as 
we honor his public career in this 
House. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a distin-
guished veteran, a congressional am-
bassador, larger-than-life figure, and 
fellow New Yorker, I urge my col-
leagues to support and pass H.R. 767 to 
immortalize Ben Gilman’s legacy at 
the Fulton Street Post Office in his 
home of Middletown, New York.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 767, to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 40 Fulton Street in Middle-
town, New York, as the Benjamin A. 
Gilman Post Office Building. 
Benjamin Arthur Gilman was a dis-
tinguished public servant with decades 
of service to both the State of New 
York and the United States at large. 
He was born in Poughkeepsie, New 
York, on December 6, 2022. He grad-
uated from Middletown High School in 
Middletown, New York, in 1941. He re-
ceived a B.S. from the Wharton School 
of Business and Finance at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania in 1946. 
From 1942 to 1945, he served in the 
United States Army Air Corps. After 
his time in military service, he re-
ceived a law degree from New York 
Law School in 1950. From 1953 to 1955, 
he served as an assistant attorney gen-
eral to the New York State attorney 
general. He then served as a member of 
the New York State Assembly from 
1966 to 1972. 
In 1972, he was elected to serve as a 
Member of Congress, serving for three 
decades before retiring in 2003. During 
his time in this House, he was chair of 
the Committee on International Rela-
tions. Congressman Gilman died on De-
cember 17, 2016, in New York State. 
Given his decades of service to our 
Nation, it is only fitting that he be re-
membered by renaming this post office 
in his honor. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill to name a post office after the late 
Representative Benjamin Arthur Gil-
man. 
Congressman Gilman was a Repub-
lican Member who represented New 
York between 1973 and 2003. During his 
time in Congress, he served as the 
chairman of the Committee on Inter-
national Relations. He was also part of 
the congressional delegation to the 
United Nations and a member of the 
Ukraine Famine Commission. 
In 2000, he helped establish the Ben-
jamin A. Gilman International Schol-
arship Program at the State Depart-
ment. The scholarship provides finan-
cial support to undergraduate students 
with limited financial means so they 
can study or intern abroad. 
Congressman Gilman was an impor-
tant and impactful Member of Con-
gress. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 767, and I yield back the balance

New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3419, to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 66 Meserole Avenue, Brooklyn, 
New York, as the Joseph R. Lentol 
Post Office. 
Assembly Member Joseph R. Lentol 
represented the 50th Assembly District, 
comprised of the neighborhoods of 
Greenpoint, 
Williamsburg, 
Fort 
Greene, and parts of Clinton Hill, for 48 
years. 
After graduating from law school and 
passing the New York State bar, Joe 
began his government career as an as-
sistant district attorney in the Kings 
County district attorney’s homicide di-
vision. In 1973, he was elected to the 
New 
York 
State 
Assembly, 
rep-
resenting north Brooklyn. 
Joe was the third member of his fam-
ily to serve in the New York State As-
sembly, as his father and grandfather 
had also been elected to the assembly. 
During decades in public service, Joe 
was a recognized champion of fair labor 
practices, criminal justice reform, and 
environmental protection. 
Because of his knowledge, experi-
ence, and negotiation skills, Joe was 
appointed to serve on various commis-
sions, committees, and panels. He 
chaired the Committee on Criminal 
and Civil Codes, the New York City 
Community Action Board, the assem-
bly Public Protection Budget Com-
mittee, the assembly Committee on 
Public Employees, the assembly Ad-
ministrative Regulations Commission 
to create the State’s open meetings 
laws, and the Committee on Govern-
mental Employees, which oversees the 
State’s pension and employee benefits, 
presiding over the State’s divestiture 
of its pension fund’s investments in 
South Africa as well as a multitude of 
bills strengthening organized labor. 
Additionally, he chaired the assembly’s 
Committee 
on 
Governmental 
Oper-
ations, monitoring and overseeing the 
operations of State agencies and de-
partments. 
For more than 20 years, as chair of 
the 
influential 
Codes 
Committee, 
which has jurisdiction over criminal 
justice, Joe was an advocate for and led 
efforts to modernize the State’s crimi-
nal justice system. 
Recognized for his leadership in cor-
recting a system that unfairly penal-
ized youth, people of color, and the eco-
nomically 
disadvantaged, 
Joe 
was 
largely responsible for getting impor-
tant legislation enacted into law by 
working with six Governors, his Demo-
cratic colleagues, and, often, members 
of the Republican majority in the 
State senate. 
Joe championed the reform of the 
Rockefeller drug laws, which mandated 
harsh sentences for possession and sale 
of drugs and disproportionately tar-
geted people of color. 
In addition, Joe fought to raise the 
age in criminal law when a child must 
be treated as an adult in the criminal 
justice system and for other major 
criminal justice reforms that over-
hauled the State’s criminal discovery 
and bail laws and that guaranteed 
speedy trials. 
Joe was also a member of the Gov-
ernor’s Commission on Sentencing Re-
form, the New York State Temporary 
Commission on Voting Machine Equip-
ment, and the New York State Court of 
Appeals Justice Task Force, and the 
New York State Comptrollers Invest-
ment Advisory Board. 
Currently, Joe serves on the board of 
the New York State Public Defender 
Association. Naming a post office for 
Representative Joseph R. Lentol is en-
tirely appropriate given his distin-
guished political career and contribu-
tions to New York State and our coun-
try. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill to name a Brooklyn, New York, 
post office in honor of lifelong resident 
Joseph Lentol. 
Joseph Lentol is a former New York 
Assembly member who followed in the 
steps of his father and grandfather. He 
has been a strong advocate for criminal 
justice reform, serving on the Gov-
ernor’s Commission on Sentencing Re-
form, and is on the board of the New 
York State Public Defenders Associa-
tion. 
Joseph serves as a role model to 
those in Brooklyn and beyond by inter-
acting with and supporting his local 
community. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 3419, and I yield back the balance

of H.R. 1444, to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 132 North Loudoun Street, 
Suite 1, in Winchester, Virginia, as the 
Patsy Cline Post Office. 
Patsy Cline was born in Winchester, 
Virginia, in 1932 during the Great De-
pression. She began singing and per-
forming at events and local venues in 
the Winchester area at a young age and 
landed her first recording contract in 
1954. Her first hit, ‘‘Walkin’ After Mid-
night,’’ debuted in 1957 and rose to 
number two on the country music 
charts. 
In 1958, Cline moved to Nashville, 
Tennessee, and was the first solo fe-
male singer to become a member of the 
Grand Ole Opry. Over the next few 
years, Cline recorded several more hit 
songs, including ‘‘I Fall to Pieces’’ and 
‘‘Crazy,’’ and appeared on American 
Bandstand and The Johnny Cash Show. 
She was acclaimed for her bold, emo-
tional, and haunting singing voice, 
which drove many of her songs to the 
top of the country and pop charts and 
influenced generations of future art-
ists, from Reba McEntire to Cyndi 
Lauper.

October 20, 2021 
Tragically, Cline was killed in a 
plane crash in Tennessee in 1963 at the 
age of 30. She was buried in Shen-
andoah Memorial Park outside of Win-
chester, where a bell tower was built in 
her memory. 
In 1973, she became the first female 
solo artist to be inducted into the 
Country Music Hall of Fame. Cline’s 
childhood home in Winchester was des-
ignated as a historic place in 2011 and 
has drawn visitors from around the 
world. 
Naming a post office for Patsy Cline 
is a way we can honor her substantial 
artistic and cultural contributions to 
our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill to name a post office in Win-
chester, Virginia, after Patsy Cline. 
Patsy began singing and performing 
at events in the Winchester area from 
a young age. Her childhood home in 
Winchester was designated as a his-
toric place in 2011 and draws visitors 
from around the world. 
This post office would further honor 
the memory of her. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1300 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
WEXTON), who is the cochair of the 
Congressional Agritourism Caucus. 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my legislation, 
H.R. 1444, to rename the Winchester, 
Virginia, post office in honor of coun-
try music legend and proud daughter of 
Virginia, Patsy Cline. 
In January 1957, Arthur Godfrey’s 
Talent Scouts introduced their live tel-
evision audience to Patsy Cline, from 
Winchester, Virginia, and launched her 
to stardom after her winning perform-
ance of ‘‘Walkin’ After Midnight.’’ 
Virginia Patterson Hensley was born 
in Winchester in my home district in 
1932. She spent her childhood years 
there growing up in the beautiful 
northern Shenandoah Valley. It was 
also where she discovered her dream of 
becoming a singer. 
The only thing that matched Patsy 
Cline’s talent was her determination. 
From the local Winchester radio sta-
tion to the Grand Ole Opry, she sought 
out opportunities to showcase her 
abilities in bold ways—writing letters, 
approaching other singers backstage, 
and even showing up at a studio wait-
ing room to request an audition. 
That talent and determination took 
Patsy Cline to places no woman coun-
try music singer had gone before. 
Patsy Cline was the first female solo 
artist to become a member of the 
Grand Ole Opry in 1960 and the first fe-
male solo artist to be inducted into the 
Country Music Hall of Fame in 1973. 
CMT has ranked Patsy Cline as the 
number one greatest woman in country 
music history. She continues to inspire 
generations of future artists. 
Her tragic and untimely death in 1963 
took Patsy Cline away from us too 
soon. But her trailblazing legacy and 
her music live on. 
Mr. Speaker, it is important to me 
that among the many great and well- 
deserved honors this American icon has 
received, she should be forever remem-
bered in her hometown of Winchester, 
Virginia. 
I am proud to sponsor this legislation 
to rename the post office along Win-
chester’s pedestrian walking mall after 
Patsy Cline. 
Her legacy is still very much felt in 
her hometown. The Patsy Cline His-
toric House, where she lived from 1948 
to 1953, is in the National Register of 
Historic Places and the Virginia Land-
marks Register and remains a popular 
tourist attraction in the Winchester 
area. Patsy Cline’s final resting place 
is just a few miles south of the house, 
in Shenandoah Memorial Park, where a 
bell tower was built in her memory in 
the 1980s. 
Renaming this post office will serve 
as further acknowledgement of Patsy 
Cline’s legacy in the Winchester com-
munity and of Winchester’s influence 
on Patsy Cline. 
The support this bill has received 
from across our great Commonwealth 
shows the enduring legacy of Patsy 
Cline and the popularity she still holds. 
Nearly 60 years after her death, people 
still ‘‘fall to pieces’’ over her music, 
and this bill proves that we are still 
‘‘crazy’’ about her. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared 
to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I 
also heard a rumor that the chair-
woman of the committee will be sing-
ing a Patsy Cline song in her closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 1444. I will not be singing, but I 
love her music, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1444. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

of H.R. 3175 to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 135 Main Street in Biloxi, Mis-
sissippi, as the Robert S. McKeithen 
Post Office Building. 
Robert 
McKeithen 
was 
born 
on 
March 22, 1961, and graduated college 
from the University of Mississippi. 
After college he served in the U.S. Air 
Force with distinction, earning the Air 
Force Commendation Medal, the Meri-
torious Service Medal, and the Air 
Force Achievement Medal. 
After his service in the Air Force, he 
joined the Biloxi, Mississippi Police 
Department where he served 24 years. 
He was one of 13 officers to earn the 
Medal of Valor for rescue efforts in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 
Unfortunately, his life was cut short 
when he was shot and killed on Sun-
day, May 5, 2019. 
Officer McKeithen was a dedicated 
servant of his country and community 
and a dedicated husband and father to 
four children. 
Mr. Speaker, naming this post office 
in his honor is a fitting way to remem-
ber this dedicated officer. I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5696 
October 20, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill which would name a post office in 
Biloxi, Mississippi for Robert Stanton 
McKeithen. 
After graduating from the University 
of Mississippi, McKeithen enlisted in 
the U.S. Air Force. Following his mili-
tary service, he became a police officer 
in Biloxi. He was one of 13 Biloxi police 
officers to earn the Medal of Valor for 
his rescue efforts following Hurricane 
Katrina. 
Sadly, after 24 years of service as a 
police officer, he was shot and killed in 
the line of duty on May 5, 2019. He was 
only months away from retirement. He 
left behind his wife, a daughter, two 
stepsons, and one stepdaughter. 
As a law enforcement officer, Robert 
McKeithen served his community with 
honor, and I support naming a post of-
fice in his memory. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
PALAZZO). 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3175 which will designate the post of-
fice located at 135 Main Street in Bi-
loxi, Mississippi as the Robert S. 
McKeithen Post Office Building. 
Robert McKeithen began his career 
in service to this great Nation and 
ended it in service to south Mississippi. 
Officer McKeithen graduated from 
the University of Mississippi and went 
on to serve in the U.S. Air Force where 
he earned the Air Force Commendation 
Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, 
and the Air Force Achievement Medal. 
He retired from the Air Force as a tech 
sergeant. 
After his service in the Air Force, 
McKeithen 
became 
an 
officer 
and 
worked at the Biloxi Police Depart-
ment for 24 years. A testament to his 
selfless nature, Robert was one of 13 of-
ficers in the department honored with 
the Medal of Valor for his rescue ef-
forts in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Katrina. 
I am inspired by his spirit of service 
and strength of character. A great man 
and officer was taken too soon, but he 
will never be forgotten. 
Officer Robert McKeithen’s end of 
watch was in Biloxi on May 5, 2019, but 
this post office renaming will provide 
for a daily reminder of his dedication 
and love for his community and our 
love and respect for law enforcement. 
I thank the McKeithen family—to in-
clude his wife, Pamela McKeithen; his 
children, Amy, Levi, Natalie, Logan, 
Lillian, and Lauren; his grandchildren, 
Delmas and Kaiden; his sisters, Melissa 
and Kathryn; and his brother, Wil-
liam—for allowing me the honor and 
privilege to introduce this piece of leg-
islation in Robert’s memory. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support H.R. 3175. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
from Kansas has no further speakers I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared

the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3175. 
The question was taken; and (two-

rules were suspended and the bill was

CAPTAIN EMIL J. KAPAUN POST 
OFFICE BUILDING 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2044) to 
designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 17 
East Main Street in Herington, Kansas, 
as the ‘‘Captain Emil J. Kapaun Post 
Office Building’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2044 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. CAPTAIN EMIL J. KAPAUN POST OF-
FICE BUILDING. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 17 
East Main Street in Herington, Kansas, shall 
be known and designated as the ‘‘Captain 
Emil J. Kapaun Post Office Building’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Captain Emil J. 
Kapaun Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous materials on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2044 to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 17 East Main Street in 
Herington, Kansas, as the Captain Emil 
J. Kapaun Post Office Building. 
Captain Kapaun was born in the rural 
farming community of Pilsen, Kansas, 
on April 20, 1915. 
He first studied classics and philos-
ophy at Conception College in Mis-
souri, and then attended Kenrick Theo-
logical Seminary in St. Louis. In 1940 
he was ordained a Catholic priest and 
appointed an auxiliary chaplain in the 
U.S. Army in 1943. 
During his time in the Army Chap-
lain Corps, he served American troops 
in the Burma and India theaters until 
the end of World War II. In 1948 he re-
enlisted in the Army Chaplain Corps 
and was mobilized in support of the Ko-
rean conflict in 1950. He was taken cap-
tive by Chinese forces on November 2, 
1950, during the Battle of Unsan, after 
repeatedly coming under fire to rescue 
wounded soldiers. 
During his captivity, he rejected 
multiple opportunities for escape, in-
stead remaining a POW providing phys-
ical and spiritual support to other 
POWs. On May 23, 1951, Chaplain 
Kapaun died of illness and maltreat-
ment. 
In 1993, Pope John Paul II declared 
Chaplain Kapaun to be a Servant of 
God, the first step on the path towards 
canonization in the Catholic Church. 
In 
2013, 
President 
Obama 
post-
humously awarded Chaplain Kapaun 
the Medal of Honor for his service to 
our Nation. 
Naming a post office for Chaplain 
Kapaun is one more way we can ensure 
that his deeds are not forgotten. I en-
courage all of my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill which would name a Kansas post 
office after Captain Emil Kapaun, an 
Army chaplain during World War II. 
Captain Kapaun was an ordained 
Catholic priest and later served as an 
auxiliary chaplain in the U.S. Army 
where 
he 
ministered 
to 
American 
troops in the Burma and India theaters 
during World War II. 
In 1950 he was mobilized to support 
the Korean conflict and was captured 
by Chinese forces during the Battle of 
Unsan. As a POW he helped find food, 
cared for the sick, and led prayers and 
spiritual services for the other POWs. 
He died of illness and maltreatment on 
May 23, 1951. 
In 1993 Pope John Paul II declared 
Captain Kapaun to be a Servant of God, 
and he was posthumously awarded the 
Medal of Honor by President Obama in 
2013. 
I want to thank my colleague and fel-
low 
Kansan, 
Congressman 
TRACEY 
MANN, for all his work on this project. 
Naming a post office after Captain 
Kapaun is a small way we can honor 
this patriot and son of Kansas for his 
service to our Nation. I might add that, 
as a Kansan, I am very proud of this, 
but as a Catholic, as well. We hope that 
it is soon Saint Kapaun.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of

b 1315 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Kan-
sas (Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my colleague, the gentleman 
from Kansas, for this time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the memory of Father Emil Kapaun, a 
man of God who served the Lord and 
his country in both World War II and 
the Korean war. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
2044 to designate the facility of the 
United States Postal Service located at 
17 East Main Street in Herington, Kan-
sas, as the Captain Emil J. Kapaun 
Post Office Building. 
In 
March 
of 
this 
year, 
Father 
Kapaun’s remains were finally identi-
fied in Hawaii, and just last month, 
they were brought back to his home-
town of Pilsen, Kansas, which lies in 
my district, the Big First District of 
Kansas. 
Father Kapaun grew up on a farm, 
became a priest in 1940 at 24 years old, 
and became a U.S. military chaplain 4 
years later. Father Kapaun received a 
Bronze Star for valor during the Ko-
rean war in 1950 when, in the heat of 
battle, he rushed to the front lines to 
retrieve a wounded soldier under heavy 
machine-gun fire, saving that soldier’s 
life with complete disregard for his 
own safety. 
He also received the Distinguished 
Service Cross, which was upgraded to 
the Medal of Honor in 2013 for another 
heroic effort in battle that same year. 
Father 
Kapaun 
rescued 
nearly 
40 
wounded comrades from no-man’s-land; 
disregarded 
an 
order 
to 
evacuate, 
choosing to stay with the wounded 
even though it meant his own capture; 
and pushed aside an enemy soldier who 
was about to execute a member of his 
own battalion. 
He was put in a POW camp, where he 
gave away his own food and dug la-
trines before dying a year later. He was 
a great man, a servant of all who fol-
lowed Jesus who said: ‘‘Greater love 
hath no man than this, that a man lay 
down his life for his friends.’’ 
Father Kapaun is on his way to saint-
hood in the Roman Catholic Church. I 
have introduced a resolution in his 
honor and today urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on my bill, which would re-
name the postal facility in Herington, 
Kansas, after him. 
My prayers are with his family mem-
bers as they celebrate his life of serv-
ice, and it is an honor to praise his 
faithfulness and bravery in this Cham-
ber today. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
from Kansas has no further speakers, 
then I am prepared to close. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill naming a post office 
after 
Captain 
Emil 
Kapaun 
in 
Herington, Kansas—although he was 
from Pilsen, a community of less than 
100 people which has a beautiful Catho-
lic church but no post office—so a post 
office in Herington after Captain Emil 
Kapaun. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 2044, and I yield back the balance

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and to include any 
extraneous material on this measure.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 960, to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 3493 Burnet Avenue in Cin-
cinnati, Ohio, as the John H. Leahr and 
Herbert M. Heilbrun Post Office. 
World War II veterans John H. Leahr 
and Herbert M. Heilbrun served as pi-
lots in the Army Air Corps. Mr. Leahr 
served as a Mustang pilot with the 
Tuskegee Airmen, and Mr. Heilbrun 
served as a B–17 bomber pilot. 
Throughout 
World 
War 
II, 
the 
Tuskegee Airmen were tasked with es-
corting American bomber groups flying 
over enemy territory. Mr. Heilbrun’s 
group was one of the few who sustained 
no losses, due to the heroic efforts of 
the Tuskegee Airmen. 
Fifty years after the war, Herb 
Heilbrun met John Leahr when he at-
tended an annual meeting of the 
Tuskegee Airmen to express his grati-
tude for their protection and service to 
his group during the war. At that meet-
ing, they learned that they had flown 
some of the same missions in Europe 
and that they shared numerous other 
traits as well. 
Mr. Leahr and Mr. Heilbrun dedi-
cated their later years to promoting 
interracial understanding and unity. 
They were honored for their book, 
‘‘Black and White Airmen: Their True 
History,’’ by the Harvard Foundation 
for Intercultural and Race Relations. 
Their work chronicles their history, 
friendship, and efforts to bring others 
together 
to 
overcome 
racial 
dif-
ferences. 
Mr. Leahr passed away on March 27, 
2015, at the age of 94. And Mr. Heilbrun 
passed away at age 100 on December 18, 
2020. 
Renaming a post office for both of 
these men jointly is a fitting remem-
brance of their work to create unity 
and understanding. I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill, which would name an Ohio post of-
fice for World War II veterans John 
Leahr and Herbert Heilbrun. 
The Tuskegee Airmen in World War 
II were tasked with escorting American 
bomber groups flying over enemy terri-
tory. I strongly support this bill, and I

from generation to generation and 
whose examples we should all follow. 
At a time when our military was seg-
regated, Herb and Johnny independ-
ently joined our armed services as spe-
cialty pilots flying dangerous missions. 
Herb flew B–17 bombers in the Army 
Air Corps during World War II, and 
Johnny flew P–51 Mustangs with the 
Tuskegee Airmen. 
At that time, they did not know each 
other. Both men returned from the war 
and lived honorable and successful 
lives independent of each other. 
Some 50 years after the war, Herb at-
tended a Tuskegee reunion because he 
wanted to go and thank the brave men 
who flew cover missions for him and 
quite literally had his back. It was 
there that he met Johnny, and the two 
started to realize just how much they 
had in common and how much racial 
segregation kept them from realizing 
it. 
Astonishingly, they discovered they 
had flown some of the same missions 
during the war. Johnny had flown 
cover on two of Herb’s missions in 
France and Poland, yet they had never 
met. As they spoke, they realized that 
they were both from Cincinnati, Ohio, 
and even more amazingly, they had 
even been classmates at the same ele-
mentary school in North Avondale, 
Ohio. The reunion was the beginning of 
a beautiful friendship that would make 
our world a better place. 
As best friends, Herb and Johnny de-
cided that younger generations should 
learn from their experiences and from 
their friendship. The two traveled the 
country, giving talks about racial tol-
erance, respect, and friendship. Over 
the years, they spoke to countless au-
diences and were honored by the Har-
vard Foundation for Intercultural and 
Race Relations for their efforts. 
Their work led to a book that they 
wrote 
together 
called 
‘‘Black 
and 
White Airmen: Their True History.’’ It 
was written about them, and it chron-
icles their history, friendship, and ef-
forts to bring others together to over-
come their divides. Their book also 
contains a grade school class photo 
with Johnny standing right beside 
Herb. Even then, he had his back. 
To honor their legacy and to con-
tinue their mission, I have introduced 
this bill with Congressman STEVE 
CHABOT to rename the post office at 
3493 Burnet Avenue in Cincinnati the 
John H. Leahr and Herbert M. Heilbrun 
Post Office. The building is located in 
the neighborhood in which the two men 
went to school together. 
Johnny and Herb share an incredible 
history and should serve as models to 
all of us. They were dedicated to their 
country and fellow servicemen, no mat-
ter their race or background. Renam-
ing this post office after them will 
honor their legacy and ensure that 
more Americans will learn of their 
story, learn of their sacrifice, and learn 
from their example. 
Herb passed away in December at the 
age of 100, joining Johnny, who passed 
in 2015 at the age of 94. They are now 
together in eternal glory. 
Herb’s beloved wife, Carol, said it 
best when describing Herb and Johnny 
as ‘‘incredible men who lived incredible 
lives not only in service to their coun-
try, but also in the lessons they taught 
us later in life about friendship, re-
spect, and tolerance.’’ 
Johnny’s son, John W. Leahr, poign-
antly noted that his father ‘‘decided 
early on that he wasn’t going to live a 
life full of hate or bitterness, despite 
the many injustices he had to endure 
throughout his life’’ and that his fa-
ther’s friendship and efforts with Herb 
should ‘‘serve as the gold standard of 
honor, respect, and kindness for us 
all.’’ 
I am so honored to have spent time 
and developed friendships with both of 
these great American heroes and their 
families. I am incredibly grateful for 
their service and will never forget their 
dedication to our country and to the 
American people. We are made better 
by the example they set for us, a leg-
acy to be very proud of. 
God bless Herbert Heilbrun and John-
ny Leahr, and may they rest in peace. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
this bill to honor two great human 
beings and true American heroes.

Mses. HERRELL and BUSH changed 
their vote from ‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’ 
So (two-thirds being in the affirma-
tive) the rules were suspended and the 
bill, as amended, was passed. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to provide the Ad-
ministrator of the Drug-Free Commu-
nities Support Program the authority 
to waive the Federal fund limitation 
for the Drug-Free Communities Sup-
port Program, and for other pur-
poses.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
Stated for: 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I 
missed a vote on H.R. 654, The Drug Free 
Communities Pandemic Relief Act, due to a 
timing conflict, as I was questioning witnesses 
at a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis 
hearing during the time of the vote. Had I 
been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on 
rollcall No. 321.

October 20, 2021 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF JOHN CEBALLOS 
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, it is 
with a heavy heart that I rise today to 
honor the life of John Ceballos, who 
passed away after a lifetime of public 
service to our country and to El Paso. 
I had the special privilege of knowing 
John as one of the most dedicated lead-
ers in our veteran community. He was 
the chairman of the Benavidez-Patter-
son 82nd Airborne Division Associa-
tion, where he continuously created a 
space of support for veterans. He was a 
mentor for the El Paso Veterans 
Courts program and would always cele-
brate the accomplishments of the 82nd 
Airborne Division. 
To know John was to know a person 
of strength and resilience. He served in 
the U.S. Army for 8 years during the 
Vietnam war. After his time in service, 
he went back to school where he grad-
uated from the University of Texas at 
El Paso, was bestowed a Master of 
Science degree, and became an instruc-
tor for the Department of Kinesiology. 
Madam Speaker, we have lost a giant 
in our community, and I ask you to 
join me in paying tribute to the life of 
John Ceballos. May his legacy of pre-
cious memories and unwavering com-
mitment to service continue to inspire 
us all. 
f 
NATIONAL FARMER’S DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, last week, we cele-
brated National Farmer’s Day. On Oc-
tober 12, we recognized farmers past 
and present for their hard work in pro-
viding our Nation and the world with 
food, fiber, and energy. 
It is a day to thank those who work 
by acres not by hours. Did you know 
that only 2 percent of the population 
feed and sustain the other 98 percent? 
On National Farmer’s Day, we can 
pay tribute to the men, women, and 
families who put food in the grocery 
stores and on our kitchen tables. 
In 2020, agriculture and related indus-
tries provided more than 10 percent of 
U.S. 
employment. 
While 
National 
Farmer’s Day has already passed, it is 
never too late to show your support or 
to thank a farmer. Consider visiting a 
local farmers market where you can 
buy directly from local farmers or 
spend a fall afternoon with the family 
at a pick-your-own farm where you can 
get the freshest fall apples and pump-
kins. 
Madam Speaker, it is important for 
us to thank our farmers and recognize 
their hard work not just on National 
Farmer’s Day, but all year round. 
CONGRATULATING 
DR. 
JOSE 
CONTRERAS RODRIGUEZ ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate my good 
friend and constituent, a veteran, a 
public 
health 
servant, 
Dr. 
Jose 
Contreras Rodriguez, on his retirement 
after dedicating over 65 years of his life 
to protect our Nation and the commu-
nity’s health. 
Dr. Contreras hails from Santiago, 
the Dominican Republic, and he did his 
residency at the University Hospital in 
San Juan, Puerto Rico. Before com-
pleting his residency, he was drafted by 
the United States Army to serve dur-
ing the Vietnam war, where he joined 
many honorable men and women who 
risked their lives to defend our freedom 
and our way of life. 
After 
his 
military 
service, 
Dr. 
Contreras returned to Puerto Rico to 
complete his residency by 1971. He was 
also a community doctor. He helped 
lead efforts to combat the great inequi-
ties in the healthcare system and pros-
tate cancer in the male population. 
Dr. Contreras is a true hero in our 
community. He is a veteran, a doctor 
that practiced. He was chief of the de-
partment at New York Presbyterian 
Hospital. For many years he worked 
for the families in the community of 
Washington Heights, right there on 
Fort Washington Avenue, where he 
still has his office, his practice. 
Madam Speaker, we congratulate 
him and we will miss him. We ask that 
this House would always remember Dr. 
Jose Contreras. 
f 
VACCINATION BY CHOICE NOT 
MANDATE 
(Mr. LONG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I want 
to read a letter that I got just 2 days 
ago. It is like a lot of letters I am get-
ting today. 
Billy, I am appealing to you as one of your 
trusted constituents and fearful mother of 
two Active Duty Marines. Is our government 
trying to force our courageous military into 
submissive robots? The disgusting abuse of 
power is now out of control when the govern-
ment begins taking away our God-given 
rights from loyal citizens and is seeking to 
take away the very dignity of those who 
served beyond measure. My son and daugh-
ter-in-law have served diligently and effec-
tively with pride and honor for 14 years. 
What can I do to help this administration 
from taking our very hearts and stomping on 
them? I believe with every ounce of me God 
is in control here and we all know who will 
ultimately win this battle. What can I do to 
help win this sooner than later. Debi. 
Madam Speaker, let me be clear. I 
have been vaccinated. I have had three 
shots. I encourage everyone to talk to 
their doctor. And if it is right for them, 
to take the vaccine. But ultimately, 
the vaccination should be a choice that 
shouldn’t be mandated by anyone. 
I had a mother show me a picture of 
her daughter in her fatigues looking at 
her newborn baby and telling me that a 
nursing mother is not exempt from 
this. 
f 
BLACK WOMEN AND GIRLS 
MURDERED 
(Ms. BUSH asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
BUSH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
St. 
Louis and I rise because in 2020, four 
Black women and girls were murdered 
per day in our country, and that kind 
of violence has continued in St. Louis 
with many Black women and girls 
being shot, some murdered over recent 
months. 
This is personal. I have had bullets 
fly past my head. I have been left for 
dead by a partner. I worry about 
whether my own daughter will get 
home safely. 
We rise united under our message: We 
will break the cycles of violence that 
are killing Black women and mothers, 
our sons and our daughters, our trans 
and nonbinary neighbors, and our sex 
workers. 
We urgently need the $5 billion for 
community-based violence prevention 
services in the Build Back Better Act, 
and we won’t stop until we have all 
that we need to keep each other safe. 
f 
AMERICANS ARE PAYING MORE 
(Ms. HERRELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
HERRELL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise in defense of American 
families who are worse off in every way 
since President Joe Biden took office 
exactly 10 months ago. 
Today, the average U.S. household 
now spends $175 more per month on 
groceries, gas, and their homes. In New 
Mexico, gas is a full dollar per gallon 
more than it was just 1 year ago. That 
may not mean much to Washington 
politicians, but it means a lot to people 
in rural New Mexico who have to drive 
long distances. It is the kind of cost 
that can hurt a family. 
Food is more expensive, jobs are not 
coming back fast enough, and the 
Biden administration tells Americans 
that they will have to be happy with no 
Christmas presents this year. In the 
middle of all this, Democrats think 
that a BERNIE
SANDERS’ budget bill 
makes sense. 
Here we sit, not even discussing the 
supplies and cargo sitting off the Cali-
fornia coast. If this is the Build Back 
Better plan, then count me out because 
it looks like we need to start making 
America great again.

House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Bobby 
Zarem of Savannah, Georgia, who, 
sadly, passed away on September 26 at 
the age of 84. 
A world-renowned publicist and the 
creator of many internationally recog-
nized media campaigns, Bobby’s life’s 
work put a smile on many people’s 
faces. He began his career in New York 
City, where he actively promoted some 
of America’s most talented individuals. 
Notably recognized for his ‘‘I Love New 
York’’ 
campaign, 
Bobby’s 
work 
touched countless lives. 
While his work took him around the 
world, Bobby’s deep love for Savannah 
was undeniable. From contributions to 
the Savannah Film Festival to co-
founding the Free Southern Theater, 
Bobby was a passionate advocate for 
the arts in the Savannah community. 
I am thankful for Bobby’s service to 
Georgia’s First Congressional District, 
and I know his legacy will remain. My 
thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily, friends, and all who knew him dur-
ing this most difficult time.

CHILDCARE IS ESSENTIAL INGRE-
DIENT IN THE BUILD BACK BET-
TER PLAN 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, the 
President’s Build Back Better plan has 
become the most important legislation 
in our history because it is essential to 
overcome the effects of the first pan-
demic in more than 100 years. So essen-
tial are the bill’s ingredients that Con-
gress faces a daunting task in trim-
ming the bill. 
One ingredient that is particularly 
essential is childcare because it relates 
to so much else: the ability of both 
women and men to work, the ability of 
children to go to school. The United 
States is the only democratic country 
that does not afford quality childcare 
to all of its families. The reason so 
many more women than men are still 
out of work is the disproportionate re-
sponsibility 
women 
absorb 
for 
childcare. This makes childcare an es-
sential ingredient in the President’s 
Build Back Better plan. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MAYOR KEVIN 
COTTON 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mayor Kevin Cotton 
from Madisonville, Kentucky, for being 
named a 2021 Angel in Adoption by the 
Congressional Coalition on Adoption 
Institute. 
The Angels in Adoption program 
seeks to honor individuals and organi-
zations that focus on adoption, perma-
nency, and child welfare issues. 
Mayor Cotton and his wife, Donna 
Cotton, consistently give back to the 
community by fostering children in 
their home. Throughout the years, 
they have provided love and care to 46 
children, three of which they adopted. 
Those who know Mayor Cotton know 
him best for his love of children, pas-
sion for foster care, and desire to make 
a lasting impact in the community 
through his business and public serv-
ice. 
I appreciate the profound contribu-
tions the Cottons have made and am 
grateful for their dedication to the gift 
and treasure of adoption. The nomina-
tion is symbolic of their devotion to 
children as well as an ambitious, car-
ing vision for the lives of others. 
I am proud to recognize Mayor Kevin 
Cotton and his wife, Donna, for their 
incredible work in the child welfare 
arena. On behalf of all my constitu-
ents, I congratulate them on their ef-
forts to make the dream of a family a 
reality for children in need. 
f 
COME TOGETHER ON 
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I just 
had to come back. I was leaving and 
saw the lady’s speech on the TV, and I 
had to come back. 
If prices have gone up in New Mexico 
and the country, a large part of the 
reason why prices have gone up is be-
cause of the pandemic, because people 
have been sick and out of work. That 
has caused the supply chains to back 
up and other things. 
She didn’t count in that, because of 
Joe Biden, people have gotten $300 a 
child per month to help pay for those 
goods, and because of actions by most-
ly the Democratic Caucus, sometimes 
bipartisan, but mostly the Democratic 
Caucus, they got stimulus checks and 
other benefits. So they have come out 
on top. 
What people should not forget is that 
we need to vote for the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill that has 17 Repub-
licans on it from the Senate. 
I have broken with my Progressive 
Caucus to vote for it because it creates 
jobs, and it is the right thing for Amer-
ica. My Republican colleagues should 
break from their caucus and commit to 
vote for the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill, too. 
If you are not for Build Back Better, 
that is your business. It is your busi-
ness on infrastructure, but infrastruc-
ture is bipartisan. The Senate made it 
bipartisan. And I broke with my Cau-
cus and my sub-caucus, and other peo-
ple will, too, to vote for it. 
Build Back Better is fine, but you 
should break and vote for the infra-
structure bill. That is something we 
should get together on. 
RECOGNIZING RETIREMENT OF 
TOMMY WHITAKER 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, it is an 
honor for me to recognize my friend 
and constituent Tommy Whitaker. 
On November 14, one day before his 
70th birthday, Tommy is retiring after 
45 years as an employee and 16 years as 
president and CEO of The Farmers 
Bank headquartered in Portland, Ten-
nessee. During his tenure, the bank has 
grown in assets from $25 million to now 
$850 million, with 10 branches and 150 
employees. 
Tommy graduated from the Univer-
sity of Tennessee in 1974 with a degree 
in business where he met his wife, Shir-
ley. He later went on to attend the 
Graduate School of Banking at Lou-
isiana State University. 
Tommy and Shirley have raised two 
wonderful children, Susan and Joseph, 
and are the proud grandparents of their 
grandson, Grayson. 
Tommy is one of Tennessee’s most 
influential bankers, and his strong 
character and devotion to service be-
fore self has gained him the respect of 
everyone in his community and be-
yond. 
It is truly an end of an era for The 
Farmers Bank. I am so grateful for 
Tommy Whitaker’s friendship and serv-
ice, and I wish him a happy retirement. 
f 
PLANS TO WEAPONIZE IRS 
(Mr. JACOBS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the Democrats’ radical reconciliation 
package and, specifically, their plans 
to weaponize the IRS and dramatically 
expand the agency’s reach into the 
lives of everyday Americans. 
Originally, Democrats’ plan was to 
hire thousands of new IRS agents to 
surveil the bank accounts of Americans 
who have $600 or more in their ac-
counts. While they have upped that 
amount in the legislation to $10,000 in 
deposits and withdrawals, this would 
still subject every American working 
at least a minimum wage job, who has 
a bank account, to government intru-
sion. 
I can tell you, and I think most of 
my colleagues would agree, that I have 
not had a constituent call and beg me 
for more IRS agents or for the agency 
to have increased ability to monitor 
their accounts. Rather, my constitu-
ents are concerned this proposal rep-
resents an attempt by the administra-
tion to weaponize and politicize the 
IRS and fund their partisan agenda. 
I believe Americans are entitled to 
privacy and constitutional rights. This 
proposal is a dramatic overreach and 
emblematic of this administration’s

OSHA CHANGES TO VACCINE 
REACTION REPORTING 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, his-
torically, under the Occupational Safe-
ty and Health Act, covered employers 
were required to maintain an annual 
log of all work-related illnesses and in-
juries. 
An illness or injury is recordable if it 
is work-related, a new case, and the in-
cident involves days away from work 
or medical treatment beyond first aid, 
among other things. 
On May 21, OSHA changed these re-
quirements. This new OSHA policy ef-
fectively removes legal liability from 
employers that require a vaccine at 
least through May 2022. Now, if a work-
er decides to get a vaccine to keep 
their job and experiences an adverse re-
action, the employer is not responsible 
for this injury. 
OSHA stated it changed this require-
ment only because they do not want to 
give any suggestion of discouraging 
workers from receiving the COVID–19 
vaccinations or to disincentivize em-
ployers’ vaccination efforts. 
Why are they trying to hide statis-
tics related to the vaccine? While this 
policy change appears to be a mere 
sidenote for OSHA’s lengthy guide-
lines, we have to ask President Biden 
and OSHA: Why is the ethical burden 
on the workers and not on the govern-
ment? 
f 
RESIST VACCINE MANDATES 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, millions of freedom-loving 
Americans with legitimate concerns 
with the vaccine—some are vaccinated, 
by the way—have had their jobs, liveli-
hoods, and military service held hos-
tage by this new vaccine mandate. 
They are being told to shut up and 
take it. That is un-American. 
With both Army Fort Rucker and 
Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in my 
district, I am especially disturbed by 
the new vaccine mandates our military 
and civilian contractors are having to 
endure. 
Last week, I spoke at a meeting of 
concerned Fort Rucker employees. We 
expected about 20 to 30 attendees, but 
hundreds showed up. Clearly, Ameri-
cans are mobilizing to resist against 
these mandates. 
I met with Lieutenant Colonel The-
resa Long, a military physician sta-
tioned at Fort Rucker. We have seen 
firsthand the health risks associated 
with the vaccine that can impact our 
military readiness. Why are voices like 
hers being ignored? She has the rank of 
lieutenant colonel; she has a medical 
degree; and she is an expert. And if she 
is not, who is? 
These mandates are about control 
and not safety. Every American must 
have the freedom to make their own 
health decisions, and our concerns will 
not be silenced. The American people 
will continue to resist the vaccine 
mandates, and I am proud to stand 
with them. 
f 
HONORING GENERAL COLIN 
POWELL 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise to pay tribute to Sec-
retary Colin Powell, America’s general. 
Secretary Powell was more than an 
astute general and outstanding civic 
leader who served our Nation’s Presi-
dent. He was kind-hearted, a genuine 
American hero. He was a man of con-
science and integrity who bravely 
stood against divisiveness and lived life 
bringing people together. 
As the son of two hardworking Ja-
maican immigrants, he knew the im-
portance of education and hard work. 
General Powell, as he prefers to be 
called, was the first African-American 
National Security Advisor, Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Sec-
retary of State, and he had 35 years of 
service in the military for this Nation. 
He described himself in a New York 
Times article, and he talked about 
himself in the third person: ‘‘Powell is 
a problem-solver. He was taught as a 
soldier to solve problems. So he has 
views, but he is not an ideologue. He 
has passion, but he is not a fanatic. He 
is, first and foremost, a problem-solv-
er.’’ And that he did. 
In Vietnam, he was a hero when the 
helicopter that he was in crashed, and 
he pulled out his commander, Major 
General Charles M. Gettys. 
Also, he was a passionate servant of 
the people. When he retired, he orga-
nized America’s Promise. America’s 
Promise helped at-risk children. I re-
member seeing his program, hearing 
about his program, and supporting his 
program. 
To his wonderful wife, Alma, and his 
children, he remains to us an ex-
tremely beloved individual. I am re-
minding all Americans, let us remem-
ber that a general can be soft and 
strong and remain a hero to all of us in 
nature, spirit, sacrifice, and deeds. 
The Nation has lost a great leader, 
but more importantly, the Nation has 
lost a symbol of what is best and great 
about America.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under

60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, during my time this after-
noon, my colleagues and I will address 
the burning issues that are on the 
hearts and minds of all our constitu-
ents back home—really, all Ameri-
cans—and that is the numerous self-in-
flicted crises of the Biden administra-
tion and the House Democrats’ increas-
ingly radical leftwing legislative agen-
da. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats may nar-
rowly control the House, the Senate, 
and the White House, but over the past 
several weeks, it has become abun-
dantly clear that they just cannot gov-
ern. 
America 
is 
in 
crisis. 
Everybody 
knows that, and everybody can feel it 
in so many areas. 
b 1630 
Today, the White House spends its 
days doing damage control on all these 
multiple crises of their own making. 
Just think of what we are facing 
right now. We have an economic crisis 
where jobs remain unfilled, prices for 
basic goods continue to rise, and the 
shelves sit empty. 
We have got an energy crisis that has 
led to the highest gasoline crisis since 
2007, and we know the projections for 
warming our homes in the winter are 
off the charts. 
We have multiple foreign policy cri-
ses, and we have on the southern bor-
der humanitarian, national security, 
and public health crises like we have 
never seen before. 
These really are existential kinds of 
threats to the country. I know our col-
leagues 
like 
to 
throw 
that 
word 
around, but it really does apply here. 
And while all Presidents confront cri-
ses beyond their control, that is not 
what is happening here. These crises— 
the 
things 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
today—are the direct result of this ad-
ministration’s own actions. 
We know that inflation is rising be-
cause Democrats are flooding the econ-
omy with money and supply is down 
because of labor shortages caused by 
the 
Democrats’ 
so-called 
pandemic 
policies. Gas prices are up thanks to a 
steady assault on our energy producers 
by the Biden administration. Our for-
eign policy is in crisis because of the 
Biden debacle in Afghanistan and all 
the other fumbles that they have made. 
The border problem is simple. They 
opened the border. They put a welcome 
mat there and told everybody around 
the world to come on in. The Demo-
crats opened it, and so we should not 
be surprised or shocked at the result of 
that invitation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5708 
October 20, 2021 
Here in Congress the picture is no 
better. If you think about this, the 
Democrats have a mere three-seat ma-
jority in this House. We have a fifty- 
fifty deadlock in the Senate. There is 
no objective person in this country who 
could look at those numbers and say 
that the Democrats have any mandate 
to ram through the most partisan and 
most expensive legislative package in 
the history of this Nation using the 
slimmest majority possible. 
If you ask the Democrats what is in 
the bill, Madam Speaker, they can’t 
tell you because they don’t know. 
Is amnesty in it? 
Well, the House certainly worked to 
add it. 
Taxpayer funded abortion? A carbon 
tax? A tax on prescription drugs? 
They have been working very hard to 
include all those things. The one thing 
they do know for sure is that they are 
deadlocked. They are insistent that 
they want to spend $5.5 trillion of hard-
working Americans’ tax money while 
inflation goes through the roof and 
while we are trying to recover from a 
pandemic. This is the worst possible 
time to be doing what they are doing. 
The American people expected com-
petence in the White House. They 
wanted 
bipartisanship 
in 
Congress. 
They have received instead the most 
incompetent White House of our life-
times and a Democrat-led Congress 
trying to push the most extreme agen-
da in our history. 
This is not hyperbole; these are facts. 
And my colleagues are going to lay out 
many of the reasons, many of the facts, 
and much of the evidence that proves 
what every American now knows intu-
itively. If House Democrats drop their 
radical, dangerous agenda right now, I 
promise you, Madam Speaker, they 
would find so many Members of this 
party on our side of the aisle who 
would be ready to work with them in a 
bipartisan fashion tomorrow. We have 
so many challenges facing the country. 
But they won’t do that. They are dug 
in. And their votes prove over and over 
now that they are determined to be Big 
Government socialists and not the 
Democratic Party of our parents’ gen-
eration. 
This afternoon we will highlight 
what this agenda is doing to our coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP-
SON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank 
my good friend and colleague for orga-
nizing and leading this leadership hour. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ad-
dress the Biden administration’s en-
ergy crisis. This is a crisis that was 
created by the Biden administration. 
Last week, the price of gas reached a 
7-year high. In fact, in my home dis-
trict, Pennsylvania-15, we are now pay-
ing anywhere from $3.49 to $3.67 a gal-
lon—well over the price any American 
should have to pay. 
In 2019 and 2020, the United States 
was a net total energy exporter. This 
means for the first time since the 1950s 
we were exporting more energy than 
importing. 
We 
were 
energy 
inde-
pendent, and we saw the many benefits 
across all sectors of United States 
manufacturing, production, and con-
sumption. For example, in 2020, the av-
erage gasoline price in the United 
States was $2.17 per gallon. 
I am proud to represent a district and 
come from a State that plays such a 
large role in domestic energy produc-
tion. In fact, Pennsylvania is the sec-
ond largest producer of natural gas and 
the third largest net supplier of energy 
to other States. Without the energy 
production of my district and others in 
rural America, our cities would wake 
up cold, in the dark, and hungry. But 
President Biden chose to stifle Amer-
ican energy production, issuing execu-
tive order after executive order reduc-
ing and even pausing our own access to 
oil and natural gas. 
In addition, the Biden administration 
has reached out to OPEC-Plus begging 
them to produce more oil which—let’s 
not forget—is less environmentally 
friendly, less humane, and less regu-
lated than United States sources. 
Last week, I joined my colleagues in 
a letter to this administration oppos-
ing the pleas, the begging to OPEC- 
Plus, and encouraging the use of Amer-
ican produced energy to meet our cur-
rent needs. We asked the administra-
tion to reverse the crushing executive 
orders impeding our own energy pro-
duction and to work with Congress on 
issues affecting American energy secu-
rity and supply. We know the answer to 
this self-imposed crisis: we must lift 
the limitations on our own energy sup-
ply. 
By repealing these executive orders 
and encouraging American producers 
to harness our abundance of natural re-
sources, we can meet our energy needs 
and we can ensure Americans and our 
allies have access to affordable, reli-
able, and exportable energy produced 
in the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
gentleman, once again, for his leader-
ship. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, this is such an important 
issue in Louisiana, my home State. We 
are a big energy State. We were so ex-
cited to have achieved not just energy 
independence under the Trump admin-
istration but energy dominance. We 
were a net exporter, and, of course, all 
that has been reversed, as my friend 
just explained. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, the fight 
to restore law and order and secure our 
southern border continues. Border ap-
prehensions remain at a 2-decade high 
as the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity warns officials to prepare for 
roughly 400,000 illegal migrants cross-
ing the border just this month. 
President Biden is more committed 
to ending President Trump’s policies 
that had successfully slowed the surge 
of illegal crossings than he is to secur-
ing our border. The cartels and human 
smugglers have taken notice of our 
weakened position and are more than 
willing to exploit these changes for 
their 
financial 
benefit. 
Meanwhile, 
those who are understandably seeking 
opportunity and a better future are 
being coached to gain entrance to the 
U.S. by claiming asylum. 
As a result of our open southern bor-
der and the refusal by the Biden admin-
istration to detain the majority of 
those we encounter, more than 2 mil-
lion illegal immigrants are expected to 
pass through our southern border this 
year. Already, 1.2 million have entered 
the country illegally and have been ap-
prehended since President Biden took 
office, and millions of these are ex-
pected to be brought into the interior 
of our country—all at taxpayers’ ex-
pense. 
The desperate situation at the south-
ern border calls for urgent action. In-
stead, House Democrats are determined 
to use the budget reconciliation proc-
ess to pass amnesty for millions of ille-
gal immigrants. This type of thinking, 
if turned into law, will have staggering 
consequences for our Nation for years 
to come. Widespread illegal immigra-
tion is detrimental not only to Ameri-
cans and our families but to our Nation 
and even the migrants themselves. 
As one of the Representatives in Con-
gress for middle Tennessee, I have the 
responsibility to safeguard our sacred 
freedoms. But if we cannot control our 
borders, how can we defend our sov-
ereignty as a nation? 
That is why I am fighting to restore 
law and order at the southern border. 
President Biden and House Demo-
crats can no longer run from this cri-
sis. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s 
effort, and I thank him for sharing his 
insights this afternoon. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the great 
gentleman from the big State of Texas 
(Mr. SESSIONS). 
Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the gentleman from 
Louisiana not only for his leadership to 
our conference but also speaking up 
and taking time out of his schedule to 
speak directly to America and Ameri-
cans about important issues that face 
our country today. 
Madam Speaker, we hear time after 
time our colleagues from the Demo-
cratic Party talk about all the violence 
that is taking place in large cities. 
Murders are up 30 percent last year ac-
cording to the FBI who talked about 
this rise. And then we turn around and 
see where they are the activists who 
are leading the defunding of police, the 
destabilization of our cities. The bring-
ing together of illegals into this coun-
try with record drug deals and amounts 
of drugs on our streets, record numbers 
of death from fentanyl, opioids—mis-
ery. 
But what does our President do? 
He goes off on an aggressive agenda, 
one which is fueled by the radicals in

October 20, 2021 
his party, one which he fully believes 
in, one that he is proud of, and one that 
they sustain and are still pushing. It is 
not enough just to push and push big 
spending and Big Government. It is ac-
tually an agenda that is in chaos. A 
chaotic agenda is apparent to the 
American people. 
For a second I would like to have us 
think back about what we have had 
previously with Republicans not only 
in charge in the House and the Senate 
but in the Presidency leading this 
great Nation. Our goal as Republicans 
is to have America to be a land of hope, 
to have America to be a land of oppor-
tunity, to have America to be a land of 
freedom, for America to be a land of 
achievement, and for America to be a 
land of heroes. 
For this to happen, Madam Speaker, 
it means that America needs its ability 
to go back to work and to have the dig-
nity of work. Madam Speaker, it means 
that we need to have Americans who go 
to work not because a government or a 
political party wants to keep people 
away from work and is using trillions 
of dollars of government funds to keep 
them there. 
Madam Speaker, we have an adminis-
tration and a President who wants to 
take people’s freedom away by requir-
ing them to wear not just masks but to 
have vaccinations or lose their job. 
But, Madam Speaker, the thing that 
is harming America that is apparent to 
everyone right now is the cost of items 
just to live. Inflation and monetary 
policy are what the Fed is responsible 
for, the Fed bank. And they are pre-
pared to give hundreds of billions of 
dollars and trillions of dollars, some 
$5,000 trillion is what they will be 
asked to go take loans out on again. 
That devalues not just the American 
dollar, but it actually causes a price in-
crease directly at the grocery store 
where people buy their food and basic 
elements. 
Inflation is at a 40-year high, but we 
keep hearing about how much money 
the government is going to put in peo-
ple’s pockets. But it is robbed when 
they net it out, Madam Speaker. 
It is robbed when they net it out be-
cause inflation robs not just people 
who have families, but it robs those 
who live on a fixed income. It robs the 
vitality and the ability that we have to 
be ingenious and to move our country 
forward. 
So, Madam Speaker, please know 
this, that the Republican Party and 
our Members who are here tonight are 
not just speaking about things because 
we disagree, it is because we love our 
country. We believe that what was 
built and available for America and 
Americans is the greatest country in 
the history of this world. We believe in 
Americanism. We believe in American 
exceptionalism. We believe in the Con-
stitution. We believe in freedom and a 
right to make our own decisions in our 
own homes and in our own commu-
nities. 
b 1645 
Increasingly, we are finding that this 
new administration, the House and the 
Senate under Democratic control, are 
taking away the basic rights and free-
doms that would have been enjoyed by 
free people, but they are not because 
this administration intends to extend 
the long arm of the Federal Govern-
ment into all transportation, to all 
members of the military, and to free 
people who want to live their own life. 
Madam Speaker, Republicans are on 
the floor today to offer better ideas, to 
offer hope and solutions, but perhaps 
more importantly to say this, that we 
believe that it is time that this admin-
istration get off its radical agenda, rad-
ical agenda that is leading America 
into chaos. 
If the President would listen, if the 
Speaker of the House would listen, and 
if the Senate majority leader would lis-
ten, they would hear even members in 
their own party saying that a radical 
agenda will greatly change America to 
where we would become a socialist Na-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, we are here offering 
the example that we have known that 
made America great, and it is called 
capitalism and freedom. 
I want to thank Mr. JOHNSON for tak-
ing the time to gather Republicans to-
gether on the floor to offer not just our 
vision but also to highlight to the 
American people that elections have 
consequences, and we look forward to 
next year. I want to thank the gen-
tleman for allowing me this time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for his 
comments, and that clarity and convic-
tion is so necessary right now. I love 
how the gentleman is articulating the 
stark differences between the two com-
peting visions for this country right 
now. The chasm is so wide between the 
Republican and Democratic Parties, 
and we say that without any pleasure 
at all. 
It is a sad development in our poli-
tics that this is not—listen to us at 
home—this is not your parents’ and 
your grandparents’ Democratic Party. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
move from Texas and move over to 
Alabama. 
I yield to the gentleman from a Ala-
bama (Mr. CARL), a good friend of 
mine. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
JOHNSON) for organizing this Special 
Order. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ad-
dress President Biden’s failure to se-
cure our borders and enforce our na-
tional immigration laws. The Biden ad-
ministration’s disregard for the na-
tional security threat and humani-
tarian crisis they have created is ex-
tremely troubling. The American peo-
ple deserve better than this. My con-
stituents in south Alabama, as well as 
millions of folks across America, share 
my concern. That is why today I sent a 
letter to President Biden asking him a 
few simple questions. They are as fol-
lows: 
Why did you stop construction on the 
border wall even though we had sup-
plies on the ground and contractors 
ready to finish it? Why? 
What is the plan to secure our border 
and enforce our immigration laws 
today? Do we have a plan? 
What is the plan to prevent addi-
tional surges of illegal immigrants who 
are crossing our border? As we know, 
there are 30- to 50,000 on the way that 
are going to get here, and I want to 
know what the plan is before they get 
here; not a week after they get here. 
What is the plan to handle thousands 
of 
individuals 
living 
in 
makeshift 
camps along the border? Can the White 
House assure us that these criminals 
who are sneaking across the border will 
not be released in our community? 
I challenge my friends from across 
the aisle to stand up and start speak-
ing out. This is not a Republican issue. 
It is an American issue. We have got to 
stand up for our constituents because 
when we are getting these people com-
ing across the border with diseases, un-
documented, the drugs, it becomes an 
American problem, and we as Ameri-
cans have got to stand together and 
fight this. 
If we can’t get the Democratic Party, 
the Democrats across the aisle, to lis-
ten to what we are saying, there will be 
a tsunami in 2022 that will change this 
House for a long time. And that is not 
what we need. We need to be working 
together. 
Although I doubt my letter will get a 
response from President Biden, I will 
continue to fight to secure our border 
so we can protect the health and the 
safety of American citizens. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend and appre-
ciate him being here tonight and ar-
ticulating that so well. 
I yield to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Vice Chairman JOHNSON, my good 
friend from Louisiana, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, no matter how hard 
the White House attempts to spin this 
economic crisis as a high-class prob-
lem, our Nation’s financial future is in 
shambles because of the Biden adminis-
tration’s policies and it affects all of 
us. 
Inflation continues to climb ahead of 
the holiday season hitting a 13-year 
high just last week. From the gas 
pump to the grocery store, Americans 
are paying more for just about every-
thing while they are working less. De-
spite having over 10 million job open-
ings across the country, only 194,000 
jobs were added last month, making 
September President Biden’s worst jobs 
report since taking office. 
Instead of putting the brakes on 
spending, Biden and his allies in Con-
gress are carelessly adding fuel to the 
inflationary fire by advancing their 
$1.2 
trillion—only 
9 
percent—infra-
structure bill, and $4.3 trillion Big Gov-
ernment socialist spending package. So

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5710 
October 20, 2021 
in the face of an economic catastrophe, 
Democrats are gearing up to spend a 
whopping $5.5 trillion on their liberal 
wish list. That is wrong for small busi-
nesses. That is wrong for hardworking 
people across the country, and that is 
just wrong for America. 
Squandering trillions of dollars for 
unpopular, radical, and dangerous poli-
cies, while imposing a $2.1 trillion tax 
hike to pay for it, will only inflame the 
current economic crisis and burden 
Americans with more financial insta-
bility. 
How many more empty shelves will it 
take and record-high gas prices—yes, 
look, $3.30 per gallon is where we are 
right now. That is a 50 percent increase 
from where we were for the last 4 years 
under the Trump administration. How 
many more struggling Americans will 
it take for the Biden administration to 
get serious about this economic crisis 
and call it a crisis, and act like it is a 
crisis? 
For the sake of our country, I call on 
President Biden to join us. Reverse 
course and work with Republican law-
makers to get our economy back on 
track. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for those 
insights. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my sometimes friend 
from Louisiana for that kind introduc-
tion and thank him so much for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, the current state of 
our economy is like a car about to blow 
through a railroad crossing. As the car 
approaches the tracks, indicator lights 
flash red warning of danger ahead. De-
spite warnings, the car tries to beat 
the oncoming train across the tracks. 
We have all seen this scenario. The 
train T-bones the car at full speed leav-
ing it in pieces. 
Think of this preventable crash in 
economic terms. We are ignoring flash-
ing red fiscal indicators like rising in-
flation, as illustrated in some of the 
issues right here; weak labor force par-
ticipation; and $28 trillion of national 
debt. We need to heed these warnings. 
If we don’t, we face the complete de-
struction of our entire economy. 
Joe Biden and the Democrats are 
crashing our economy. They control 
the spending in Congress and the Fed-
eral agencies overseeing various sec-
tors of the economy. Since these folks 
don’t seem to care or want to work 
with us Republicans, they are the only 
ones who can stop this out-of-control 
economy from colliding with disaster. 
Instead of steering the economy 
away from danger, Joe Biden and the 
Democrats are going to put the pedal 
to the metal in pursuit of their multi-
trillion dollar, far-left political agenda. 
Their expensive socialist plan reck-
lessly overstimulates the economy, 
pays folks not to work, and bloats our 
national debt. 
Pumping trillions into our economy 
will devalue the American dollar. Com-
bine this with rising prices, everyday 
folks won’t be able to afford a whole 
lot. Democrats risk crashing the econ-
omy if they choose to move forward 
with their political agenda, Madam 
Speaker. 
Let’s not lie about who is going to be 
hurt the most if this happens. It will be 
our poor and working-class folks, our 
fellow Americans—both the Repub-
licans and Democrats, conservatives 
and liberals. Paychecks just won’t go 
as far as they did before, as we are see-
ing 
already. 
Vulnerable 
folks 
will 
struggle to afford basic goods and serv-
ices for their families. 
Picture that car colliding with the 
train, Madam Speaker. Think of that 
total devastation. It can be prevented 
if the flashing red warning signs are 
taken seriously and heeded. Joe Biden 
and the Democrats need to get control 
of our economy or let the Republicans 
take the wheel. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my always friend. 
The gentleman’s metaphor paints a 
real picture. We are headed for a crash 
if we don’t change course. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. 
OWENS), my good friend and Super 
Bowl champion. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank my friend from Louisiana for 
his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, as crisis after crisis 
emerges from this administration, I 
would like to take a moment to discuss 
an issue that has been on my mind and 
in the hearts of millions of Americans: 
the crisis at our southern border. 
It is a humanitarian, national secu-
rity, and public health crisis that must 
be addressed immediately. I have seen 
these horrific scenes for myself down in 
McAllen, Texas, and further south 
through the Darien Gap where families, 
women, and children endure a dan-
gerous trek to America. 
For the past 9 months, the border has 
served as a hotbed for drug smugglers, 
human traffickers, child trafficking, 
and illegal immigration, and is a direct 
result of the disastrous and harmful 
open border policy of President Biden 
and Vice President HARRIS. 
These policies are enriching the car-
tels, smugglers, and human traffickers 
who prey on and abuse women and chil-
dren crossing the border. Some report 
earnings as much as $14 million a day. 
These are horrendous crimes and 
they have no place in our country. 
Here is what we know: During the 
month of August, almost 19,000 of the 
208,000 illegal immigrants to cross the 
border were unaccompanied minors. 
With a record number of minors cross-
ing the border alone, we need to be ac-
tively taking steps to prevent preda-
tors from exploiting these innocent 
children. 
Another fact: The number of illegal 
immigrants taken into custody along 
the southern border topped 1.2 million 
since February. This does not count 
the hundreds of thousands of got- 
aways. This crisis is not seasonal, is 
not inherited. It appears like a pur-
poseful chaos by our Democratic Party. 
We must restore security at the south-
ern border, end illegal immigration, 
and take immediate steps to prioritize 
the health and safety of all Americans. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
comments. The gentleman is right. It 
does appear to be purposeful. The 
chaos, there is just too much of it, and 
that is what people back home say. 
This has to be intentional. 
There is no way that we could have 
these many dilemmas piled upon each 
other this quickly unless there were 
some ulterior motive. It is a rhetorical 
question, I suppose, for the American 
people. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
yield to the gentleman from New Jer-
sey (Mr. VAN DREW). 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman JOHNSON, my always 
friend, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, our country is expe-
riencing an unbelievable crisis at our 
southern border. In August alone, the 
United States Customs and Border Pro-
tection encountered over 200,000 mi-
grants at the U.S.-Mexico border which 
was a 317 percent increase from August 
of last year. Let me repeat that one 
more time: a 317 percent increase from 
just one single year ago. 
President Biden has prioritized re-
versing 
effective 
Trump-era 
border 
policies such as the Remain in Mexico 
Policy and most notably, the border 
wall. They were working. We literally 
have tons of building materials, all of 
which have been bought and paid for by

American taxpayers, sitting in the

dent Biden cares more about trying to 
be politically stylish than he does im-
plementing policies to protect and 
strengthen our America which we love 
so much. 
Is President Biden requiring these 
migrants to show proof of vaccination? 
The answer is no. Are they being tested 
for COVID–19? The answer is no. Are 
they being tested for other deadly vi-
ruses? The answer is no. 
Americans are still unable to return 
to their normal ways of life but hun-
dreds of thousands of illegal immi-
grants are allowed to breach and break 
through the border and infect our Na-
tion. How does that make sense? How 
can any one individual American make 
any sense or understand that?

border wide open. Again, how does it 
make sense? How can we understand 
it? How can we believe it? 
The Border Patrol is on track to en-
counter more migrants this year than 
it has in any year prior. In fiscal year 
2021, roughly 10,000 migrants with 
criminal records were detained at the 
southern border. This is no joke. This 
is a real tragedy for America. The 
former Border Patrol chief has also 
stated that our Border Patrol is en-
countering known and suspected ter-
rorists at ‘‘a level that we have never 
seen before.’’ This is no joke. This is 
the real world which we live in now in 
America. 
There are serious shortages among 
Border Patrol agents, and somehow 
congressional Democrats and the ad-
ministration are making zero efforts to 
address them. They fail to recognize 
the severity of the issue or even admit 
that there is an issue to begin with. 
Again, it is no joke. These men and 
women are putting their lives in dan-
ger. Half the time they don’t even have 
the backup that they should. I remem-
ber when I went to the border and saw 
them encountering all types of dan-
gerous situations. Not a single backup 
sometimes. How can we do that to our 
American men and women in law en-
forcement? 
Make no mistake about it. I don’t 
want anyone to think otherwise. Make 
no mistake—this is the worst border 
crisis that we have ever experienced in 
America. President Biden is actively 
destroying our country and our way of 
life by not taking this crisis seriously 
at all. But he should. I will say it 
again. This is no joke. It is the real 
thing. 
Madam Speaker, God help us all. We 
must save our country. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for doing 
all he does to save this country, and we 
have a lot of work still to do. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER), who is my good friend. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend Mr. JOHNSON 
very much, our conference vice chair, 
for putting this together today. 
Madam Speaker, as we all know, we 
have the latest crisis under the Biden 
administration, known as the supply 
chain bottlenecks, particularly at our 
U.S. ports. We have thousands of ships 
waiting to be unloaded with goods that 
the consumers of the U.S. have pur-
chased. 
Now, some of this could be said to 
have been COVID related due to the 
manufacturing delays and disruptions 
in the U.S. and worldwide. But that 
was the reason for shortfalls last year. 
This situation has been very much ex-
acerbated by the policies of the Biden 
administration. 
You see, in Q4 of 2020, we had a 4 per-
cent GDP growth, which is pretty good, 
and it was followed by 6 percent in Q1 
of 2021, which is very good. Then came 
along the so-called rescue plan, which 
every economist worth anything said 
was three times too high in taxpayer 
dollars. They continued enhanced un-
employment supplement under this 
plan; spent trillions of taxpayer dol-
lars; extended 100 percent health insur-
ance through COBRA, a further dis-
incentive to work; and sent stimulus 
checks of $5,600 to families of four. 
There is something in all of the 
sciences, Madam Speaker, known as 
the law of cause and effect, and the ef-
fects of these actions have included 
disincentives to work, rampant infla-
tion, heavy consumer spending, but no-
body to make the goods and provide 
the services. 
So since the production in the U.S. is 
down, all of these products are now 
coming from Asia as the thousands of 
containers waiting off our coast prove. 
So the blunders and mistakes being 
made have caused overdemand, weak 
production, and less trucks on the 
road. 
Some in this House call this the 
economy of the future, the modern 
monetary theory. My constituents call 
it Big Government socialism versus 
free market capitalism or just simply 
economic madness. 
But wait. We are not finished. Or 
they are not finished. Progressives in 
this House that, let’s be honest, run 
this House and the White House, are 
holding a transportation and infra-
structure bill hostage while doubling 
down—no, tripling down—no, 3.5 tril-
lion down on all of the effects of this 
liberal economic policy. So we will 
continue with the disincentives to 
work; we will continue spending us 
into oblivion; and we will add to it 
taxes on small businesses and families 
and all who purchase goods while infla-
tion increases, making American busi-
ness less competitive worldwide. 
This is why $3.5 trillion in a rec-
onciliation plan must be stopped, and 
the American people need to contact 
their Members because they are not 
giving us a seat at the table to nego-
tiate or discuss this disastrous plan. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for that 
really good explanation of what we are 
facing right now. People back home are 
scratching their heads, how can it 
come to this? Well, you see, it is the re-
sult of policies that are being imple-
mented by this administration. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN), also 
my good friend. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from Louisiana for 
holding this Special Order and his lead-
ership in our conference. 
It started off with the war on fossil 
fuel and then the border crisis. Now, 
this new deal is about a war on small 
business. And the Biden administration 
and BERNIE
SANDERS’ trillion-dollar 
tax-and-spend bill, it is not about ad-
dressing our Nation’s urgent needs, 
which I have just described, like: rising 
inflation; supply chain crisis; illegal 
immigration—we should not say illegal 
immigration; it should be human traf-
ficking and drug trafficking—or the 
crime rate in the country. It is a blue-
print to bankrupt and fundamentally 
turn America into a Big-Government, 
socialist Nation. 
So what is included in their House 
Democrat bill? It includes a radical ex-
pansion of the IRS, granting them un-
precedented access to the bank trans-
actions of a vast majority of Ameri-
cans. Again, a war on small business. It 
allows 
on-demand, 
taxpayer-funded 
abortions 
by 
excluding 
the 
Hyde 
amendment protections. Folks, we are 
just one of three countries that allow 
elective, full-time abortion. The other 
two are not good company: China and 
North Korea. 
It provides college financial aid for 
illegal immigrants. It advances Green 
New Deal priorities to the tune of $630 
billion at the expense, again, of small 
businesses. 
It forces taxpayers to spend nearly 
$14,200 per person per year for govern-
ment-controlled healthcare plans, dou-
bling the cost of the average employer- 
sponsored healthcare plan. 
It continues welfare benefits without 
work 
requirements 
for 
able-bodied 
adults without dependents, at a time 
when there are 10.1 million jobs open-
ings. Folks, I am talking 25 million 
people, work-capable people. 
That is not all. The Democrats are 
desperately trying to sell this bad bill, 
with both Biden and NANCY
PELOSI 
falsely claiming it will cost zero dol-
lars. You have got to be kidding. 
But the American people can see that 
this costly bill will wreck our econ-
omy, all to advance the Democrats’ so-
cialist agenda. 
We must fight for the future of this 
Nation by stopping their tax-and- 
spending spree. My friends, why in the 
world would you follow the Biden ad-
ministration and BERNIE SANDERS over 
the cliff after every legislative initia-
tive that has been created by this ad-
ministration has resulted in a crisis 
and caused the American people tre-
mendous suffering? Stop this nonsense. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, it is nonsense indeed. 
Madam Speaker, as they say, every-
thing in Texas is bigger, including the 
representatives. 
I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER), also my good friend. 
Mr. 
PFLUGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
thank you to my good friend from Lou-
isiana. 
Crisis after crisis after crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I rise against the 
extreme anti-American policies that 
we see right now that are being dis-
cussed in this forum, in this House. 
I ask two simple questions of the 
President: Are you making us more se-
cure? Are you making us more pros-
perous? 
And the answer to that is no. Un-
equivocally, no. 
We have got an anti-American energy 
movement in this country that is going 
to devastate every American. It is

October 20, 2021 
going to leave us cold, dark, and hun-
gry; it is going to embolden our adver-
saries; and it is going to harm our envi-
ronment. 
This administration is taking a hard 
line against American energy by can-
celing thousands of pipeline jobs, by 
canceling 
drilling 
permits, 
by 
kneecapping our energy producers with 
targeted tax increases and harmful reg-
ulations. 
Americans are already feeling the 
pain of the Biden energy crisis at the 
gas pump, at the grocery store, where 
we see exorbitant prices that are con-
tinuing to skyrocket. 
Just today, I had a Democrat col-
league who said: In my district, small 
businesses are feeling the pain every-
where. I said: Well, push back. Stop 
this madness. Any vote for reconcili-
ation is a vote against the American 
worker; it is a vote against American 
energy. 
To make matters worse, heating bills 
are forecasted to be 54 percent higher 
in 2021. Under this administration, 
make no mistake about it, middle-class 
families will pay the price, and they 
will be forced to think twice before 
turning the heat on this winter. 
We are nearing an all-out energy 
emergency that is eerily close to where 
our neighbors in Europe are feeling, at 
$25 for gas—$25 in Europe. It is only 
going to get worse. 
Instead of unleashing the producers 
in the Permian Basin, where I rep-
resent, people who have done more to 
innovate and bring emissions down to 
levels that the Paris climate accords 
could never have dreamed of, we are 
cutting them off at the knees. The 
American family, our mothers and fa-
thers, the working-class American, is 
who is paying for this. 
Adversaries whose energy is nowhere 
near as clean as ours are going to ben-
efit from this. 
You see that today, on average, $3.30 
per gallon, over a dollar more at the 
pump than what we saw last year. It is 
only going to get worse. 
I am urging my colleagues to oppose 
this radical agenda, to stand up for 
American energy producers, and to pro-
vide every American household with af-
fordable, reliable energy that has come 
from this country that has allowed us 
to lift a billion people out of poverty in 
this world. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, Mr. PFLUGER said it so well. 
We feel this acutely in energy States 
like Texas and my home State of Lou-
isiana, 
the 
Permian 
Basin 
and 
Haynesville Shale, but all across this 
Nation. We benefit from domestic en-
ergy production. It is not only the 
cleanest and the most efficient, it ben-
efits us here at home. It is that Amer-
ica first idea that this administration 
is abandoning too quickly. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise this evening deeply concerned 
about the pressures that have been 
brought to bear on America’s supply 
chains and the effects that those pres-
sures are having on inflation and on 
the constituencies that we represent. 
Every day, I talk to members of the 
community from my district who are 
struggling in paying their bills. They 
are struggling because, just in the last 
year, they are being asked to pay over 
$20 more in my county to fill their gas 
tanks to get to work. They are being 
asked to pay substantially more for 
commodities like milk and eggs and 
bacon. 
Madam Speaker, economists say that 
this inflationary pressure is greatly ex-
acerbated by the irresponsible spending 
decisions that have been made right 
here in this Chamber in the last 18 
months. That is important to talk 
about tonight, because we are consid-
ering the largest spending bill in the 
history of our country. 
In fact, if you take the version of 
that bill that is in print and the spend-
ing it represents, combined with the 
extra Federal spending that has been 
approved over the last 18 months, 
added together, that exceeds the com-
bined annual wages of every single 
American. I find that a stunning sta-
tistic. I am also very concerned about 
the possible impact that this spending 
will have on our national debt. 
Now, the administration just this 
week has said that this spending pack-
age will be fully paid for and will not 
add a single dollar to our deficit. My 
response to that is: prove it. 
b 1715 
Speaking charitably here, it strains 
credibility to believe that that would 
be the case. It is certainly not the case 
that the current version of the spend-
ing bill that is in print is fully paid for. 
But if the new version will be paid for, 
prove it. Wait to vote on the bill until 
the Congressional Budget Office has 
had a chance to score it and verify that 
that claim is accurate. 
Madam Speaker, even if that is the 
goal, I would submit that America does 
not have a revenue problem. In fact, 
last year we collected more in tax rev-
enue than in any year in our entire 
country’s history. We do not have a 
revenue problem, Madam Speaker. We 
have a spending problem. 
Even if you believe, as some of my 
colleagues do, that the problem is that 
we don’t tax people enough and that we 
need to enact the largest tax increase 
in the history of our country, which is 
what this bill would do, then my ques-
tion would be, why would we not use 
that extra revenue to shore up the so-
cial safety programs that are already 
in danger of failing, programs that peo-
ple depend on, like Medicare and Social 
Security? 
Why would you not use that extra 
revenue to pay down the $2 trillion of 
deficit that we currently have every 
year and the almost $29 trillion of na-
tional debt that we will be passing on 
to our children and their children? 
Madam Speaker, I pray that we will 
get our fiscal house in order and stop 
this reckless Federal spending. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
those insights. It is so important that 
people recognize what is happening 
here. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to 
how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Louisiana has 12 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
urge the American people not to take 
their eyes off the ball. I honestly some-
times believe the reason the majority 
party is putting people like Steve 
Bannon in the headlines, or mandatory 
vaccines, as horrible as they are, or 
driving up the cost of gas to over $3 per 
gallon, it is to cause the American pub-
lic to avert their eyes from the most 
long-term dangerous policy that the 
Biden administration is implementing, 
and that is what is going on, on the 
border. 
I was down on the border last Thurs-
day in the Yuma sector. So the Amer-
ican public understands, there are nine 
sectors along the border, and every 
time I go down there, I find more 
things that should scare the American 
people to death. 
First of all, we have just the sheer 
number of people who are crossing the 
border. A year ago in July, for all nine 
sectors, an estimated 8,000 people were 
crossing the border. We are now up to 
over 100,000 people a month crossing 
the border. 
As far as the type of people coming 
across the border, I saw something in 
the Yuma sector I hadn’t seen before, 
and that is dozens of identifications 
scattered along the ground where peo-
ple crossed from Mexico into Arizona. 
Why are people throwing away their 
identification prior to checking in at 
the Border Patrol? There is only one 
obvious reason. They don’t want the 
United States to know who they are. 
These people are paying the drug car-
tels to come here. If you are from Mex-
ico, you are paying $3,000 or $4,000 a 
person. If you are from Central Amer-
ica, you are paying $6,000 to $8,000 a 
person. If you are from Brazil, you are 
paying over $10,000 a person. 
The drug cartels are recruiting peo-
ple by putting on Central American TV 
or Brazilian TV ads urging people to 
come here. There are some Americans 
who are taking out ads telling people it 
is not all it is cracked up to be to turn 
yourself over to the drug cartels. 
But right now, clearly, many people 
are crossing the border. These are not 
people, by the way, coming across in 
desperation. They are people with very 
top-of-the-line shoes or top-of-the-line 
purses, well-done hair, well-done nails. 
People have to realize that people are 
not always coming here out of even a 
little bit of desperation. They are com-
ing here because it has been advertised

October 20, 2021 
they will make more money coming 
here. 
As far as families, in July, in all nine 
sectors, there were about 15,000 unac-
companied children coming here. You 
go down there and see children in what 
can only be described as pens, being 
held on mats as they wait for the 
United States to transport them wher-
ever they want. They write on their 
clothes which address they should be 
delivered to, and we turn the children 
over to nonprofit organizations that 
will transfer these children to New 
York, to Denver, wherever they want 
to go. 
It drives the Border Patrol up the 
wall because, of course, if any Amer-
ican 
took 
a 
5-year-old 
child 
and 
dropped them off at the airport and 
said, ‘‘Please deliver this child to Or-
egon,’’ or Maryland or wherever, social 
services would be after them. 
But the United States, due to ne-
glect, has pushed a policy in which peo-
ple south of the border are encouraged 
to turn their children over to the Bor-
der Patrol and transfer them wherever 
they want. 
Of course, as we have more and more 
children come here, the Border Patrol 
cannot patrol the border because they 
have to spend all their time processing 
the little children. The more Border 
Patrol is not patrolling the border, the 
more people are just walking in here, 
without any vetting at all. 
Last year in the Yuma sector, they 
would be processing maybe 25 people a 
day. This year it can be up to 700 peo-
ple a day. And it is not a difficult 
thing. 
The way they treat each other is 
kind of a sign that maybe they might 
not make the greatest people to have 
around America. They needed help re-
cently because of fights between the 
Haitians and the Colombians. Is that a 
sign of the type of people that we are 
letting into our country? 
Other things that you learn down 
there: In the past, when I would go 
down to the border, I was under the im-
pression that if people had any symp-
toms, they were tested for COVID. 
Now, we don’t want another 100,000 peo-
ple a month here under any cir-
cumstances. But right now, I was told 
that we like to test them, but of 
course, you can’t require people to be 
tested, which means we are letting peo-
ple in this country who may well have 
COVID. 
Now, I don’t know what to make of 
that. I guess what I make of it is when 
the 
Biden 
administration 
requires 
mandatory vaccines for people, it is 
really not that important. They are 
just doing it to avert people’s eyes be-
cause if it were that important, they 
would be requiring at least tests for 
people coming over the border. But 
they don’t even require tests. We will 
just let them come here. 
Other activities of the Biden admin-
istration clearly are acting as magnets 
to bring more people here. One of the 
reasons why the people on the Mexican 
side of the border, the Mexican mili-
tary, does not seem to care as much 
now as they did a year ago is because 
why should they risk their lives taking 
on the drug cartels when the American 
Government, by all of their actions, in-
dicate that they don’t care whether we 
enforce the border? 
Two examples. We have, of course, as 
well advertised free medical care for 
people coming here, and there are Bor-
der Patrol agents who believe people 
just come to the United States for the 
free, superior medical care. 
In the reconciliation bill that is 
being passed here, people who come 
here illegally are getting free college. 
Talk about a magnet to come to the 
United States. Of course, it shows con-
tempt for the American middle class 
that we are seeing more and more. 
If you are a member of the American 
middle class and want to go to college, 
you take out those student loans, go 
$30,000 in debt, go $40,000 in debt, go 
$50,000 in debt. But if you are somebody 
showing up here illegally, you get free 
college. Talk about advertising that 
our administration does not even re-
motely care whether our immigration 
laws are being obeyed or not. 
The other thing that we have moving 
through here, again, on the reconcili-
ation package is we believe about 10 
million more people coming here, who 
we did not appropriately, vet are going 
to be eligible for amnesty and allowed 
to become American citizens, which is 
a further magnet, bringing more people 
here. 
While there are a lot of things filling 
up the newspapers today—well, people 
don’t read newspapers, but a lot of 
things filling up the TV screen or the 
computer screen—I want the American 
people to contact their legislators and 
pay attention to what is going on at 
the border. 
There are people right now who per-
manently want to change America, and 
they are going to get away with it un-
less there is more of an uproar here 
saying: ‘‘Get that immigration stuff 
out of the reconciliation package. Fi-
nally hire some more Border Patrol 
agents to see what is going on down 
there. And please, please, please go 
back, Biden administration, to the 
Mexican Government and renegotiate 
deals where we keep people south of 
the border.’’ 
By the way, while I am talking about 
things that indicate there is a com-
plete lack of caring on the southern 
border on the part of the Biden admin-
istration, when was the last time we 
saw Vice President KAMALA HARRIS at 
the border? I tell you, if you go down 
to the border there are all sorts of Con-
gressmen poking around, seeing what 
is going on with the most important 
issue facing America today. Where ex-
actly is KAMALA HARRIS, as she just 
brazenly ignores this crisis? 
Please, America, wake up, and defend 
our southern border. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. He is 
right. We better wake up. 
Just by way of a quick reminder, 
over 1.2 million illegal immigrants 
have been apprehended at the border 
since February alone. We know that 
number is grossly undercounted be-
cause of all the got-aways and people 
who came totally undetected across 
the totally open border. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
LAMALFA), my good friend. 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today marks exactly 9 months in of the 
Biden administration. The motto was 
Build Back Better. So, where do we 
stand? What have we built back better 
on behalf of the real American people 
out there? 
He talked about unity in his inau-
guration speech. It only seems to be 
that he has unified the American peo-
ple in anger at the cost of doing busi-
ness. Everything has gone up for Amer-
ican families, as you see from this 
chart here. 
In my home State of California, ev-
erything is going up. We see fuel. We 
heard the national average is $3.30. In 
my home State, it is anywhere from 
$4.20 to $5. Now, it is not the rest of the 
country’s problem how the State runs 
itself, but it kind of underlines that we 
have big problems. 
What is the focus going to be? The 
Biden administration is going to make 
it where farming in California is even 
more difficult. We are going to have 
fewer of the crops California grows, 
therefore driving inflation even more 
on everything when these crops have to 
be replaced with foreign imports. 
I mean, come on. The inflation is 
being caused by this government, when 
you pull just $4 trillion or $5 trillion of 
spending out of midair. Now they are 
threatening to have tax increases on 
certain people, whether it is corpora-
tions or the rich or whoever. But then 
they back off on that, and they say no 
tax increases on those under $400,000. 
It is going to be impossible to pay for 
this without doing that. Show us how 
you are going to do it. The inflation is 
going to kill the American worker, es-
pecially 
middle- 
and 
lower-income 
folks. 
It is irresponsible what is going on. 
Just throwing these terms, trillions of 
spending—stimulus spending is basi-
cally what it is because it isn’t infra-
structure. Trying to sneak it through 
in budget reconciliation by getting a 
mere 50 votes over in the Senate is 
really a sleight of hand that is going to 
hurt this country. 
This country is already hurting com-
pared to a year, year and a half ago, 
the way our economy is right now, our 
energy reliability, our food reliability. 
You want to talk supply chain? All the 
ships are sitting off California, waiting 
to be unloaded. 
There is one thing about it: If we 
were building it here, if we were pro-
ducing it here, manufacturing it here, 
we wouldn’t have to be worried about 
unloading ships. But when you chase 
the jobs out of the country with hor-
rendous regulations and the taxation

that is going to be upon business, farm-
ers, timber fallers, you don’t get a good 
result. 
The Biden administration needs to 
take a real good hard look at how eco-
nomics actually work and quit doing 
this to the American people because, I 
will tell you what, we are not going to 
have much left after 4 years of all this. 
I appreciate my friend here from 
Louisiana trying to bring this to the 
American people with the time here to-
night on seeing how this 9 months in of 
the Biden administration is costing 
and hurting regular Americans. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, Mr. LAMALFA is exactly right. 
It has been only 9 months. It is only 
going to get worse. 
Madam Speaker, what you have 
heard tonight is a quick summary from 
a number of our friends. We could go on 
for hours if we had the time, but I 
know we are almost out of time. 
We talked about the economic crisis, 
energy crisis, foreign policy crisis, bor-
der crisis. It goes on and on and on. I 
will summarize and close with this: We 
have two competing visions for Amer-
ica. It is now very clear: It is free-mar-
ket capitalism v. Big Government so-
cialism. 
I think the American people see the 
results of the latter. I hope we have an 
opportunity very soon in the next elec-
tion cycle to get back to the former. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

THE CARE ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. SPEIER) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I am 
astonished by the last hour. It is like 
they are living in a different universe. 
If you look at the economic growth in 
the United States under this adminis-
tration, it is actually growing at such 
a rate that by the end of the year it 
will have reached 6 percent in growth. 
So all of that blather that went on on 
the other side of the aisle should be 
registered as what it is: False. 
But we are here to talk about some-
thing much more important than a 
bunch of lies. We are here to talk about 
what 90 Members of the Democratic 
Women’s Caucus are concerned about, 
and that is the care economy. The 
question that we want to ask is: Why 
does America not value our families or 
our children? 
Why is it that France has provided 8 
weeks of maternity leave to working 
women since 1913—yes, since 1913—yet 
we struggle to provide paid family 
leave? 
Why is it that Germany 30 years ago 
was able to decide children have the 
right to quality childcare, yet some of 
my colleagues call universal childcare 
and pre-K a handout? 
Surely if our European counterparts 
can understand that childcare and pre- 
K is not babysitting, it is education 
that fuels the brain and emotional de-
velopment in the most formative years 
of a child’s life so that children can 
grow and thrive, we certainly can grasp 
that. 
Surely my colleagues who stand here 
and preach about the sanctity of life 
can understand the hypocrisy of advo-
cacy for birth but not advocacy for life. 
After they come out of the womb is 
when we should be investing in them. 
And surely, they can understand that 
the she-cession that happens to both 
Republican women and Democratic 
women is real in this country and has 
resulted from a pandemic that isn’t 
just a burden on working women and 
families, it is a burden on all of us. It 
is an issue that touches every corner of 
our society and government from na-
tional security to economic growth, 
and most importantly, the health and 
well-being of our children and the 
progress of our country as we work to 
build back better. 
Now, I am just getting started here, 
but I have got many colleagues who are 
here and want to speak to this issue. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Ms. 
SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman SPEIER for yielding. 
I appreciate it. 
I rise today to talk about the 
childcare crisis facing our Nation, and 
by extension, our national economy. 
I rise today to share the stories from 
working mothers in my district, to 
outline the disastrous impact main-
taining the status quo will have for 
families and communities and busi-
nesses, and to instill a sense of urgency 
for addressing this childcare crisis, be-
cause prior to COVID, women rep-
resented over half the working people 
in this Nation. Over half. 
So let’s be clear, when working moms 
are losing ground, that is the American 
middle class losing ground. And the 
current 
reality 
of 
the 
American 
childcare system is endless waitlists 
for spots that may never open up. 
The current reality is unreasonable 
costs that eat away at 20, 30, 40 percent 
of a working parent’s paycheck. 
In fact, I have a constituent who has 
two children in childcare and pays over 
the amount of their paycheck in 
childcare. And in over half of the 
States in this Nation, center-based in-
fant care costs more than in-State col-
lege tuition. That is what is facing 
families today. 
And the current reality is to make it 
work, often for families—including my 
own family—the only way you make it 
work is with the help of grandparents 
or friends. So God help you, if you 
don’t have that safety net in place. 
The current reality is that too many 
moms are being forced to leave their 
jobs because they simply can’t make it 
work. And if we don’t act, too many of 
those moms will not be able to re-enter 
our workforce. 
Two weeks ago, I convened a round 
table to have an in-depth conversation 
with working women in NJ–11. The sto-
ries I heard on that call mirror the ex-
periences of women across my district, 
of the women serving alongside me in 
this legislative body, and they mirror 
my own experiences over the past 16 
years as a working mom raising my 
four children. 
Anyone who has had a child in the 
last few decades knows that the bar-
riers to entry for childcare in America 
begin before your first child is even 
born. You are only pregnant for 9 
months, but mothers have told me 
about 2-year waiting lists and a dearth 
of available options. 
That situation got worse during the 
pandemic, with many centers closing 
down or going out of business. 
And that is the current reality when 
things go according to plan. 
During that round table, we heard 
from too many people who had changes 
in their lives which upended their 
whole childcare plan. During that 
round table, I heard from a professor 
who told me about how her search for 
childcare became twice as hard when 
she and her wife found out they were 
expecting twins. It got even harder 
than that when they were born pre-
mature and had health concerns that 
required in-home care. 
She and her spouse were forced to 
make the impossible choice to cut 
their income in half so one of them 
could stay at home or to incur the as-
tronomically high cost of in-home 
care. That is the catch-22 our families 
are facing too many times today. 
I have a working mom and a council-
woman in my district who faced a simi-
lar dilemma. When she had her son, she 
was lucky enough to find a great 
childcare center with space for him, 
but the price of quality care was steep. 
She was in the position where her sal-
ary was just above the cost of care. 
Like far too many women, she consid-
ered leaving the workforce simply be-
cause the costs were unjustifiable. But 
in her case, she couldn’t afford not to 
work. And she is lucky she didn’t stop 
because we know that for women who 
quit the workforce for even 1 year, that 
is a 40 percent pay cut over the next 15 
years. 
This issue is about the family budget, 
the bottom line, the ability to make 
ends meet. And for too many families, 
the exorbitant costs of childcare place 
them just steps away from financial 
ruin.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5715 
October 20, 2021 
My councilwoman was lucky to find 
good childcare near where she lived, 
but what happens when you move? 
Well, we heard from another working 
mom about that. She and her husband 
had great daycare for their 1-year-old 
that they really loved. They were one 
of the lucky ones. Unfortunately, when 
they decided it was time to move, they 
couldn’t find anywhere with space near 
their new home. So for months before 
they got off the wait list at a new cen-
ter, they left their house every day at 
6:30 a.m. to drop their child off at the 
old daycare center before starting their 
own long commute to work. 
But even with that daycare system, 
she still needed help from a family 
member to pick up her son when the 
daycare center closed hours before she 
and her spouse finished work. And this 
dilemma has only gotten worse during 
COVID with childcare centers scaling 
back their hours due to workforce 
shortage issues. 
All of these barriers come with a di-
rect economic cost. This isn’t just a 
woman’s issue. This isn’t just a chil-
dren’s issue. This is a critical economic 
issue facing our Nation. 
In September alone, 26,000 women 
lost jobs while more than 200,000 men 
gained jobs. And that is not to mention 
the more than 300,000 women who left 
the workforce entirely that month. 
We are leaving hundreds of billions of 
dollars of potential economic growth 
and improved GDP on the table by fail-
ing to fix this crisis and continuing to 
force women out of the workforce. 
And we are certainly not solving the 
workforce crisis facing communities 
all across this country. 
Tonight, you will hear from many of 
us outlining the stories that we our-
selves and our constituents face, the 
concerns that the very real obstacles 
and challenges with childcare across 
this country are hampering too many 
women in the workforce. We are jump-
ing through hoops and making tough 
financial decisions, calling on friends 
and family members just to find and 
maintain 
affordable 
and 
quality 
childcare. And as a result, our families 
are suffering. 
The progress women have made in 
the workforce and in our society is suf-
fering. 
Our economic recovery post pan-
demic is suffering. 
But it doesn’t have to be this way. 
We have the opportunity to make 
crucial investments in our childcare 
system to ensure that no family in this 
Nation pays more than 7 percent of 
their income on childcare. This budget 
plan represents an important start to 
helping working women stay in the 
workforce after having a child, help 
those who left re-enter, and keep more 
money in the pockets of hardworking 
families across this country. 
And we can do all this as we ignite 
our economic recovery and build back 
better. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
would ask the Congresswoman, before 
she leaves, she has also served in the 
military, and as she called upon this 
being an economic issue, is it not also 
a national security issue? 
Ms. SHERRILL. Will the gentle-
woman yield? 
Ms. SPEIER. I yield to the gentle-
woman from New Jersey. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, it 
truly is. And as you know, as you chair 
your subcommittee and hear, I’m sure, 
from far too many families about as 
the difficulties of childcare grow, the 
difficulties of being a fully deployable 
force like our United States Navy 
grow. 
So certainly, it is a national security 
issue, as well. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for partici-
pating today. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL), my friend 
and colleague, and co-chair of the 
Democratic Women’s Caucus. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive SPEIER for her leadership today. 
Madam Speaker, I have this speech 
and all that, but I don’t want to make 
a speech. I told my friend I was just 
going to rant. She said: ‘‘Go to it.’’ 
I am listening to the cable news and 
all that, and they say the Democrats 
are fighting and they are talking about 
the moderates and the progressives, 
and I just want everyone to know this: 
We are fighting. We are fighting for 
you. We are fighting for the American 
people. And especially we are fighting 
to make sure that women and children 
are on this train when it pulls out on 
build back better. 
First of all, I am a very proud mem-
ber of the Florida delegation, but I am 
not really here as a Representative. I 
am here as someone who was a working 
mother and now I say I am a working 
grandmother. And I remember those 
days of having to juggle and make sure 
my son was in good, nurturing care as 
he was growing up and I was working 
full time. And now I have grand-
children whose parents both have to 
work full time, and I think about them 
all the time. Who are they going to be 
left with? What about when they have 
their colds? 
I 
had 
forgotten, 
Representative 
SPEIER, that your first year of pre-K 
you are constantly sick. So not only do 
they go to school, then they have to 
have someone to take care of them 
when they have that cold. And I think 
my colleague from New Jersey gave a 
really good summary of what it is like 
for the parents struggling to make 
ends meet. 
We know that parents are really 
making the least amount of money 
usually when their kids are the young-
est. And it is really a stretch for so 
many parents to even afford childcare, 
and then for the sandwich generation 
to have to take care of the elderly or 
the disabled loved one who needs home 
care. 
But I want to talk about also, Rep-
resentative SPEIER and Madam Speak-
er, about the worker, the people in 
whose care we are leaving the people 
we love the most. 
Representative SPEIER, did you real-
ize that the average salary for a 
childcare worker or a home care work-
er is about $27,000 a year? 
Ms. SPEIER. It is about $11 an hour, 
isn’t it? 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Will 
the gentlewoman yield? 
Ms. SPEIER. I yield to the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. So 
you think about it. After you pay your 
rent, your car payment, your insur-
ance, your food, you buy your clothes, 
it doesn’t leave much, if anything. 
And think about the responsibility of 
these workers, as I said, taking care of 
our precious children. 
And I want to give you an example, 
because the average income of all 
workers in the United States is $68,000. 
I would like that to be higher, too, and 
I am not saying that other people don’t 
deserve good salaries, but just to give 
by comparison, a truck driver, $46,000; 
a schoolteacher, $64,000; an accountant, 
$79,000; a plumber, $60,000. I can go on 
and on. A salesperson, $64,000. 
I am not saying they don’t deserve 
that money, but don’t the people who 
take care of our loved ones also deserve 
to make money so they can have a de-
cent life? 
Ms. SPEIER. Isn’t it stunning that 
we will pay those who watch our 
money six times as much money as we 
will pay those who take care of our 
children? 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Well, 
how about parking your car in a park-
ing lot? We pay more to have someone 
watch our car than we do to watch our 
children. 
And it is not only not fair and not 
right, but it also mostly affects women 
of color because that is who predomi-
nantly are our caretakers, and as a re-
sult, Madam Speaker, of this paying so 
little, there is a tremendous shortage. 
Would you tell us, Representative 
SPEIER, what this means today in 
terms of the childcare and the home 
care industry in terms of getting peo-
ple to even work the job? 
Ms. SPEIER. Well, that is why we 
have lost so many slots in childcare 
centers around the country. That is 
why 60 percent of our families live in 
childcare deserts now. Think about 
that. 
b 1745 
There is no childcare available, even 
if they have the resources to pay for it 
because 
the 
infrastructure 
doesn’t 
exist anymore because we paid them so 
little. And the Build Back Better plan, 
as you know—and you can articulate— 
is going to change all of that. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Right. Because we are going to build 
back better for our children, and espe-
cially our working parents, for the el-
derly, who we love, and the disabled, by 
not only making it more affordable,

but also raising the wages of our care 
workers. We are talking about a trans-
formational bill with Build Back Bet-
ter. 
Madam Speaker, I know you appre-
ciate this, and those here today, is that 
we are fighting in this bill to have uni-
versal pre-K for all 3- and 4-year-olds in 
this country, getting our children off 
to a good start. 
Representative Speaker, I know you 
can tell us, what does it mean when a 
3- and a 4-year-old gets off to a good 
start, and how does that equate to how 
they are going to do later in life? 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, we all 
know that from 1 to 3 is when the brain 
is developing. That is when the re-
sources need to be made available to 
these young infants and toddlers so 
that they will be prepared to then go 
into pre-K and then into school. If you 
don’t have that experience, you are not 
going to have the children being able 
to do well in school and then to be able 
to be persons in our communities who 
are working very important jobs. So if 
it is truly about the children, let’s 
make it about the children and build 
back better. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, this is a declaration 
in the United States of America: That 
getting children off to an early start at 
ages 3 and 4 is as important as getting 
them into kindergarten or 6th grade, or 
whatever. 
Madam Speaker, I know I said one 
last thing, but I do have one last thing, 
because we are talking about taking 
care of our families. If anything we 
learned from the pandemic, is the im-
portance of being able to take care of a 
loved one when they are sick or dis-
abled, or whatever. That is why the 
paid family leave provision of Build 
Back Better is so important. 
In fact, is it true that we are the only 
industrialized nation in the country 
that does not have a paid leave policy? 
Ms. SPEIER. That is correct. In fact, 
as I pointed out earlier, France had it 
back in 1913. Think about that. We are 
a century later and we are still strug-
gling with parental and medical leave. 
It is important to point out, the vast 
majority of this money, in terms of 
who takes advantage of parental and 
medical leave, it is for the individual. 
Fifty percent of the paid leave goes for 
an individual who is sick and who 
needs that particular benefit to be able 
to have the surgery or be provided the 
healthcare during a time of sickness. 
So when we say paid parental and 
medical leave, the big beneficiary of 
that benefit is probably an older Amer-
ican who is in the workforce who, with-
out this, would have to use their sick 
leave up and then probably go on un-
paid leave. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I am glad I got to do 
my little ranting and raving. I know I 
have colleagues who are going to add a 
lot to this. 
The American people should know 
that the Democratic Women’s Caucus 
right here, and we represent people all 
over the country— 
Ms. SPEIER. Ninety of us. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
There are 90 of us. We are fighting for 
you. We are going to build back better 
for our women, our children, our par-
ents, our grandparents. We love them 
all. I have two grandsons; I want them 
to have the same rights as every little 
girl. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
the 
gentlewoman 
and 
dear 
friend, Ms. FRANKEL. 
Madam Speaker, I would also point 
out that as we look at the infrastruc-
ture bill that everyone is supporting, 
that trillion-dollar package is going to 
create 2 million jobs over the next 10 
years. That is great, but 90 percent of 
those jobs are going to men. 
Meanwhile, the pandemic has created 
an 
environment 
where 
1.6 
million 
women have left the workforce. That is 
the lowest participation of women in 
the workforce since 1988. We are going 
back. We are not going forward, unless 
we have the Build Back Better plan, 
which is going to provide the infra-
structure for childcare and pre-K and 
the opportunity for women to get back 
to work. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY), my dearest friend. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
The Democratic Caucus—and I see 
that now we have all three of the lead-
ers of that caucus that I am so proud to 
be a member of. 
Madam Speaker, my daughter is a 
childcare worker. She works in a 
childcare center, and I am so proud of 
her and just the effort and the cre-
ativity and just the energy that she 
puts into this very low-paid job. If it 
weren’t 
for 
someone 
else 
earning 
money in the household, she could not 
really afford to live on that pay. 
I quote from a scholar who said, 
‘‘most developed countries in this 
world have some kind of a robust social 
safety net. The United States has 
women.’’ And when it comes to taking 
care of those in need, either as workers 
or as family members, it is mostly 
women. 
I want to tell you that in the 
eighties, I was director—and proudly 
so—of the Illinois State Council of Sen-
ior Citizens. And as part of that, I was 
a cochair of the Long-Term Care Coali-
tion that we had in Illinois. 
At that time, there was no long-term 
healthcare policy in the United States 
of America. And guess what? There is 
no long-term care policy in the United 
States of America right now. Families 
are left to figure it out. 
What are we going to do? I am get-
ting older. I don’t have family. 
What am I going to do to take care of 
myself? I am getting older and my fam-
ily is the only one available to take 
care of me. 
I have to move in with my children, 
or they have to move in with me to 
take care of me because there is no 
other choice. 
Or you end up—I don’t know—in 
some kind of an institution where peo-
ple, 
again, 
are 
poorly 
paid—often 
women of color, often low-income 
women. In fact, for home care, the av-
erage worker does make about $12 an 
hour, with no benefits. And if you have 
to travel from one place to another, 
there is no payment for that kind of 
transportation or getting there. It is 
not really doable. And so we have made 
pretty much no progress until now. 
And then the President of the United 
States, Joe Biden, said we are going to 
have Medicare, home- and community- 
based services in this country. 
Now, 
he 
announced 
a 
very 
big 
amount of money to go for that. I don’t 
know if that is going to be able to be 
paid for fully right now in the Build 
Back Better plan, but we are going to 
make a start. We are going to say yes. 
It is not just that we are going to leave 
families, women at home, not being 
able to go back to the workplace them-
selves. We are going to have a home 
care policy. And that is where people 
want to be, in their homes, in the 
United States of America. 
I believe that we will see billions and 
billions of dollars that are going to be 
able to go to long-term care. And we 
are going to pay attention to these 
workers. It is not right. It is not pos-
sible to depend on workers who, them-
selves, live in poverty; don’t have 
someone to care for them when they 
get older; often can’t even afford to 
get—we talk about paid sick leave— 
have no health insurance, have no 
backup, if they get sick. 
This is absolutely not working in 
this country. If we are going to build 
back better, we have to build back bet-
ter for women. We have to build back 
better for women toward the end of 
life, as we age. We have to take care of 
women and children in this country. 
It is really embarrassing, in a way, 
when we look at the rest of the world, 
how far behind the richest country in 
the world is in taking care of our fami-
lies, the most in need in our country. 
But we are finally at a tipping and 
turning point right now. We have an 
administration, we have leaders in the 
House and the Senate who are now say-
ing those days are gone. 
We are now going to be a country 
that, as the President says, is built 
from the bottom up and the middle 
out. We are going to take care of work-
ers. We are going to take care of fami-
lies, and we are going to take care of 
women and children. I am just so proud 
to be part of a caucus that is deter-
mined to make this a reality, to trans-
form the United States of America into 
a place that is safe and healthy and has 
opportunity for all of us. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her rousing 
speech and making the case, once 
again, that women are the backbone of 
this country. If we build back better in 
the Build Back Better plan, what we

will have is a situation where 2 million 
more jobs will be created. There will be 
$24 billion more in take-home pay for 
women, which will then move through 
the economy and benefit all of us, as 
well. 
It is my great pleasure to introduce 
one of our newer Members, but one of 
our feisty new Members. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman. It is an honor to be 
part of the Special Order hour, it is an 
honor to be called feisty, and it is an 
honor to follow my good friends and 
colleagues, 
Representative 
FRANKEL 
and Representative SCHAKOWSKY
as 
they talked about different aspects of 
the 
care 
economy. 
Representative 
FRANKEL was focused on childcare. She, 
of course, has grandchildren and is 
very focused on the care that they are 
receiving. 
Madam Speaker, I want to tell a per-
sonal story, because it is something 
that I, frankly, having had this experi-
ence, this issue of the care economy 
might not resonate as much with me as 
it does. 
In 2014, my mother was diagnosed 
with brain cancer. She was an incred-
ibly independent woman, had always 
had a career until she retired, lived 
alone, gardened, took care of her home, 
and was, in all respects, somebody 
that, quite frankly, my sister and I 
thought was going to live to be 100. She 
was 82 at the time. Everything changed 
on a dime. 
She was diagnosed with brain cancer 
in the summer of 2014. We, her daugh-
ters, were told that she had a pretty 
short time left to live. And it was a 
shock, nothing that we could in any 
way have planned for or anticipated or 
made prior arrangements. But we knew 
that it was incredibly important that 
we bring her to one of our homes for 
the remaining weeks or months that 
she had to live. So she was transported 
to my home where we had home hos-
pice care for her. 
I worked full-time as a lawyer at the 
time. My sister worked full-time. Obvi-
ously, our first concern was our moth-
er, but both of us also had careers and 
bills that had to be paid, that we had 
worked for for so many years. And so 
what ended up happening was that we 
engaged home healthcare workers to 
help us take care of our mother. It was 
only because of those tireless home 
care workers that were with her at her 
bedside during the night so that I could 
sleep, providing essential care, and it 
was only because of them that my fam-
ily and I could rest somewhat easier 
knowing that mom had the help and 
the resources that she needed around 
her. 
I can tell you, quite honestly, that 
we would not have made it through 
those months had we not had the ben-
efit of home healthcare workers. And I 
have to tell you, again firsthand, 
watching a parent or a loved one suffer 
is hard enough, but those workers—and 
they were all women, I might add—who 
came into our home, made it just a lit-
tle bit easier for me and for my sister 
and the rest of our family, knowing 
that she had a team of hardworking 
caregivers by her side through her 
sickness. 
We know that home care workers 
have been on the front lines this past 
year. We have heard a lot about it. 
Quite honestly, until the pandemic, I 
don’t know that we ever really heard 
much about home care workers, but 
they cared for our most vulnerable pop-
ulation. They put themselves and their 
families at risk. They did this while 
earning near poverty wages. 
b 1800 
We know that home care workers are 
three times as likely to be living at or 
near the poverty line, with many of 
them struggling to afford their own 
healthcare while they provide essential 
services to the elderly and disabled 
Americans. 
One home healthcare worker in my 
district who cares for a young man who 
is disabled told me that she has not 
taken a single day of vacation time in 
more than 10 years. She is a young 
woman, but she has been working for a 
long time. She hasn’t taken a single 
day off. This kind of thing is com-
pletely unacceptable. 
I stand with them in their call for a 
long-overdue raise, improved worker 
benefits, and the opportunity to orga-
nize and collectively bargain. 
None of us are able to anticipate 
when we are going to need this kind of 
care for somebody in our family. It 
happens, as it always does, when you 
least expect it. 
This is the smart thing to do. We 
have the opportunity now at a pivotal 
time. By the way, as our Nation grows 
older, the need for this critical work-
force is only going to grow. 
The commonsense investments that 
we are talking about as being part of 
the Build Back Better Act are abso-
lutely commonsense investments that 
will create jobs but will also provide 
the necessary support both in terms of 
healthcare support and emotional sup-
port for families that our aging popu-
lation is going to require. 
For too long, this population of 
workers has been underpaid and under-
valued, and that has to end with the 
Build Back Better Act. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her com-
ments. I think it is important to point 
out, as she did, that when we are in a 
situation where we want to bring our 
family members who are dying home 
and keep them at home, and bring in 
home healthcare, we are actually sav-
ing money for the Medicare system be-
cause if they were hospitalized, the 
cost per day would be prohibitive. 
I had my mother-in-law, my father, 
and my mother all living with us at the 
end of their lives, and it was a great 
source of solace to know that they 
could stay home and bring in a home 
healthcare worker. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, that is 
what we experienced. She was hospital-
ized for a full month before we brought 
her home for hospice care, during 
which she underwent all kinds of, 
frankly, 
unnecessary 
interventions 
that the facility was required to do. 
She was in daily physical therapy, 
which was almost ludicrous for a 
woman who had just weeks left to live. 
Yes, the cost factor to Medicare is sig-
nificant as well. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from Michigan 
(Mrs. LAWRENCE), a co-chair of the 
Democratic Women’s Caucus, an out-
spoken advocate for so many of these 
issues. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
want to recognize the strong leadership 
of our co-chair, not only just now in 
her leadership role in the Democratic 
Women’s Caucus, but throughout her 
tenure in Congress, JACKIE SPEIER. I 
thank her for this Special Order hour. 
Since the start of this pandemic, 
women have lost more than 2 million 
jobs, and our labor force is down, for 
women, to 57 percent. Why does that 
matter? It is because women’s labor 
force participation—please hear this 
number—contributes more than $7 tril-
lion to the U.S. GDP every year. So 
when you talk about building back 
with women, there is an economic in-
centive for us to do that in America. 
The reality is there are far too many 
women in the United States who care 
for their children and the elders in 
their families. They are looking at sit-
uations where it is far too expensive. 
We heard the description of my two 
colleagues caring for their elder par-
ents. Do you know what that would 
mean if they didn’t have a childcare or 
elder care system to take care of them? 
In reality, in America, there are 
women who call in sick and who take 
off from work because they have a 
child that is suffering from cancer or a 
parent who is dying, and they are the 
only ones to do this. And they cannot 
afford to pay for it. We know that car-
ing for our loved ones should not force 
women to make a choice between the 
two. 
In 
Michigan, 
44 
percent 
of 
the 
Michiganders live in a childcare desert. 
As we talk about this, some people go 
like, you know, let them figure it out. 
In some scenarios, there isn’t even a 
childcare facility for the parent to 
even consider or try to figure out how 
to pay for it. The reality is that there 
is such a large number of women who 
work two jobs, one to pay for childcare 
and one to put food, shelter, and cloth-
ing on their children, because there are 
not other options. They can’t afford 
the childcare. So, do I lose my home 
and have childcare? 
They work two jobs, and being away 
from home for an extended period of 
time has its own built-in problems. 
I want you to know that the Build 
Back Better agenda increases access to

affordable childcare. How amazing is it 
to say that every family in America 
would not have to pay more than 7 per-
cent of their income for childcare? We 
talk about childcare workers—and I 
just want to go back to the page that 
my colleague was just talking about. 
Disproportionately, when we are at 
that point where we have needs, it is a 
woman who knocks on our door to pro-
vide the childcare, and it is a woman 
who knocks on the door to take care of 
our elderly. And, disproportionately, 
they are women of color, Black women, 
Hispanic women, Asian women who are 
the majority of caregivers in this coun-
try. 
What do we do? We say our children 
and our elders are our most precious in 
our family. I will walk through fire for 
my child. There is nothing I won’t do 
for my parents. But we disrespect these 
workers every day with these pathetic 
salaries that we have in America. In 
the Build Back Better agenda, we will 
be boosting the compensation for our 
care workers so that they can feel the 
respect and the honor and go home and 
take care of their own families. 
Madam Speaker, I was a dear friend 
of Aretha Franklin, and every time I 
talk about this, I think about that 
song: All I am asking for is just a little 
respect. 
In America, how can we say some-
thing is so precious to us but we dis-
respect those who show up, hold the 
hands, wipe the noses of our children, 
who tuck in our elders, and sometimes 
they are there when they take their 
last breath. America, we can do better. 
I want you to know that building 
back better—and we have coined the 
term, and we will not walk away from 
that—and our colleagues are working 
because we can build back better in 
this country with human infrastruc-
ture. You can’t do it unless you build 
back better with women, and that 
means paying attention to the service, 
to the need for care, for the need to in-
vest in our human infrastructure. 
If you want to improve poverty in 
America, invest in jobs and invest in 
women. The majority of those in pov-
erty in the United States of America 
are women heads of households who 
have children. We make an effort to en-
sure no one goes hungry in America, 
but we disrespect those who care for 
our loved ones. 
Madam Speaker, I want you to know 
that I am standing here today locking 
arms with my colleagues. I want to, 
and I will, demand that America build 
back better. I know that my colleagues 
in the Democratic Women’s Caucus are 
fired up and ready to go because we 
know this opportunity to put our 
thumbprint on the values of America, 
of what we are going to do, is laid out 
in Build Back Better. 
We know that we are negotiating and 
fighting, and we will not step down, 
just like the suffrage women who 
fought and knew it was time to stand 
up, march, chain ourselves to the 
fence, whatever we have to do to con-
tinue to build back better, and we are 
making this investment. 
We have a President who has joined 
in. We have a Speaker of the House 
who has joined and locked arms with 
us and the Democratic Caucus. We are 
saying that Build Back Better will 
build back families, and it will trans-
form the lives of women in America. 
We can’t wait any longer. On infra-
structure, a pothole is an inconven-
ience, and we need to fix our potholes. 
We need to make sure that our children 
are not drinking lead-poisoned water. 
We need to make sure that our bridges 
and all those are fixed. But we also 
need to know that the human beings in 
this country deserve our passion, our 
work in the build back better agenda. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my co-chair for that passionate 
speech. I think you pointed out, as 
heads of households, that the feminiza-
tion of poverty that was dubbed some 
30 years ago is still, in fact, what we 
are dealing with today. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Yes. 
Ms. SPEIER. That is part of what we 
are trying to do with Build Back Bet-
ter. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
HOULAHAN), my colleague on the Armed 
Services Committee and the Military 
Personnel Subcommittee, and someone 
who has served our country in the mili-
tary. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative SPEIER for yield-
ing. It is a pleasure to be standing by 
her side and on the shoulders of so 
many powerful women who have gone 
before me and who have had this im-
portant conversation over and over and 
over again. 
It is time that I have the opportunity 
to rise next to them in this Chamber 
for a couple of reasons. One, we do have 
the opportunity to celebrate some 
strides that we have recently made in 
securing the historic paid family and 
medical leave for some people. My part 
of this conversation will talk about 
that. 
We also need to recognize where our 
Nation falls woefully short on deliv-
ering that promise to support all work-
ers and families in Pennsylvania and 
beyond in this matter. 
Like many of you all, I have pictures 
of my family in my office. For me, see-
ing the faces of my husband of almost 
32 years and our beautiful daughters al-
ways buoys my spirit and is a constant 
reminder of the story I bring to Con-
gress. 
As a parent, my own story begins 
with the birth of my first child while 
on Active Duty serving in the Air 
Force. This chapter of my story is im-
portant, and it drives my commitment 
to this critical issue of work and paid 
family leave. In part because of the 
lack of affordable childcare and limited 
time for my own maternity leave, I 
separated from the service 30 or so 
years ago. 
Sadly, my story is not unique. In 
fact, still to this day, we know that 
there are problems, particularly with 
childcare issues on bases that have 
wait lists as much as 6 months to a 
year. It is that story that continues to 
play out in households, not just mili-
tary households, but all households 
across our country. 
Too many people are faced with the 
impossible choice of caring for their 
family or caring about their employ-
ment. The people in my district and all 
of our districts deserve better. 
As an empathetic, compassionate 
country, we need to be able to under-
stand and act on the repeated calls 
from the American people to help one 
another. In this great Nation, people 
should not be forced to choose between 
their kids and work or their aging par-
ents and work. 
It may be that you have not heard 
from any of those most affected, so I 
will share a couple of stories from my 
own community. 
Susan, in Pennsylvania, told us that 
not having access to paid leave forced 
her to liquidate her retirement assets 
so she could care for her newborn. 
Lynn, also from the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, is a home care health 
worker, and she shared with us that 
without a single day’s sick leave, that 
meant that she is stuck with the 
choice between protecting her own cli-
ents and having a short paycheck and 
unpaid bills as a result. 
When I think about the hardships of 
people like Susan and Lynn, I know 
that is not who we are as a Nation. We 
can’t allow mothers and fathers to go 
into debt to raise their newborn babies 
and children. We cannot accept a sys-
tem that forces those who are sick to 
choose between paying their rent or ex-
posing their coworkers and clients to 
illness, especially as COVID continues 
to wreak havoc on our country. 
We cannot ignore the crystal-clear 
research that confirms what we al-
ready know to be true, that paid leave 
is an overwhelmingly bipartisan and 
popular idea. Democrats, independents, 
and Republicans agree that family-cen-
tered policy strengthens our economy 
and small businesses; it does not weak-
en them. We can, in fact, be both pro- 
business and pro-family. 
b 1815 
So while my story is deeply personal, 
I am also an engineer, so I would like 
very quickly to share some data and 
facts with you, Madam Speaker, in ad-
dition to these stories. And here they 
are: Policies like paid family leave will 
lift up the middle class. Sixty-two per-
cent of workers earning less than 
$30,000 a year received no pay during 
leave for family caregiving or personal 
health issues compared to only 26 per-
cent of those earning more than $75,000 
a year. These policies will bring more 
equity to our workforce. Over a 2-year 
period, 26 percent of Black workers re-
ported needing to take time for family 
or personal health, but not being able 
to take that time, and 13 percent of 
White workers reported the same.

These policies like paid family leave 
and paid medical leave will strengthen 
our economy. Research shows that 
women have a greater attachment to 
the labor force if they are allowed paid 
leave, and with an economy that needs 
every single worker, we cannot neglect 
51 percent of our workforce. 
These policies will also help small 
businesses. Over 60 percent of the ex-
ecutives in a recent Bipartisan Policy 
Center survey believe that paid family 
leave has a positive impact on em-
ployee morale, employee retention, and 
their company’s ability to attract new 
employees. 
Lastly, these policies will modernize 
our U.S. economy. As many of my col-
leagues have mentioned, we rank dead 
last—number 35 out of 35—amongst ad-
vanced economies offering competitive 
paid leave for mothers and others. 
We simply cannot delay any longer, 
and the time is now to invest in paid 
family and medical leave. 
I would like to say that we are mak-
ing progress. In 2019 I worked with 
Chairs Maloney and Smith to success-
fully pass into law 12 weeks of paid 
family leave for 2.1 million Federal 
workers, and I led legislation through 
the Foreign Affairs Committee to har-
monize parental leave policies for 
State Department employees around 
our country and around the world. This 
year, I helped to write a bill through 
the Armed Services Committee that 
codifies 12 weeks of parental leave for 
all of our uniformed servicemembers 
regardless of their branch of service. 
This summer I championed an effort 
with over 100 of my colleagues urging 
House leadership to include paid family 
leave in Build Back Better, and, just 
yesterday, I co-authored this letter to 
President Biden, again, with more than 
100 of our colleagues asking him to do 
everything in his power to protect 
these critical investments in our Build 
Back Better Act. 
This comes at a time when we are 
making progress for the people. As 
House Democrats we are centering on 
you, the hardworking, sensible families 
of Pennsylvania, as we deliberately in-
vest in our shared future. 
As a member of the Democratic 
Women’s Caucus, whom I am very 
grateful to stand here with today, I 
stand united with my colleagues to-
night, and I assure you that we are en-
suring that our economy is robust. 
So when I see that picture of my fam-
ily in my office and I remember what is 
at stake for my family and for yours, I 
will continue to work hard, along with 
all of my colleagues, to make sure that 
we are protecting these interests and 
these dreams for our American future 
and our people. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Pennsyl-
vania for her comments. 
I do believe that today a woman serv-
ing in the Air Force would have the 
benefits of 12 weeks of paid parental 
leave and, hopefully, in the very near 
future a childcare system that will not 
speak of some 9,000 who are waiting for 
childcare slots that don’t exist in 
childcare centers in the military. 
It is shameful that we have to legis-
late that, but we are in the process of 
doing it. 
I now will join my colleagues in wel-
coming our colleague from the great 
State of Illinois, one of our new but 
very 
effective 
members, 
Congress-
woman MARIE NEWMAN. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I am 
so pleased to be here with all my col-
leagues from the Democratic Women’s 
Caucus. I thank Representative SPEIER 
for hosting this Special Order hour to-
night. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on be-
half of the millions of parents strug-
gling to pay for childcare each and 
every day. It has become abundantly 
clear: our current childcare system is 
absolutely untenable. 
Just this past September more than 
300,000 women left the workforce. As we 
all know, women are more likely to be 
the primary caregiver in a household. 
With a growing lack of affordable 
childcare options, we are seeing more 
women forced to quit their job in order 
to stay home and watch their kids. 
Let’s be clear: no parent should be 
forced to quit their job because they 
cannot find childcare they can afford. 
But the reality for too many families is 
that this is definitely the case. They 
cannot afford childcare in their area, 
period. 
Just this week, NPR reported that 
one in three American families are 
struggling to find childcare they des-
perately need. I repeat: one-third of 
America’s families cannot find afford-
able childcare. 
In Illinois, 58 percent of residents live 
in a childcare desert—58 percent. That 
is more than half. In fact, infant care 
in Illinois costs just $168 less than in- 
State tuition for a 4-year public col-
lege. So think about that, Madam 
Speaker. If you are a mom and a dad 
and you have kids of various ages, or 
you are getting prepared to have kids 
of various ages, you are thinking about 
childcare now, Madam Speaker, and 
you are paying effectively what you 
know you may have to pay for college 
in later years for your children. It is 
astonishing. We can and must fix this. 
Under President Biden’s Build Back 
Better Act, we can finally ensure every 
American has access to quality, afford-
able childcare. This will provide moth-
ers with the support they desperately 
need to return to the workforce. 
This is not only the morally right 
thing to do, but it is actually one of 
the strongest ways we can further 
boost our economy. I am tired of hear-
ing some colleagues complain about a 
labor shortage while at the same exact 
time they are trying to block families 
from receiving the affordable childcare 
they need to return to work. I think 
that you don’t have to go too far, 
Madam Speaker, to understand wher-
ever you go on any block in America, 
women are saying: I can’t afford 
childcare which is why I am going 
back. 
We have to stop blaming it on these 
fictitious things. Women need to have 
childcare so they can go back to work. 
Enough is enough. For far too long 
our country has worked for the largest 
corporations and the ultra-wealthy 
while working families have been left 
behind. Let’s change that by passing 
the Build Back Better Act for working 
families, and let’s deliver universal, af-
fordable childcare. Let’s get this done. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her com-
ments and for her great leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from the great State of Cali-
fornia (Ms. BARRAGA´ N). 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I am here to talk about the Build 
Back Better agenda and two specific 
aspects that I want to highlight, some 
of which have been covered today, and 
to share some of my personal story. 
The investments in home care and 
paid family and medical leave are per-
sonal to me, to my constituents, and to 
the American people. 
Not just American workers get paid 
family medical leave benefits from 
their jobs. My sister, a Federal worker, 
is a nurse. She helps deliver babies at a 
military hospital in Colorado. Last No-
vember she was diagnosed with cancer. 
We are about the same age. She is a 
couple years older than I am. All of a 
sudden, we learned there is no paid 
family medical leave. 
So what do people have to do? 
They either have to leave their job, 
or go without pay, or in this case ask 
co-workers to donate their leave and 
their time so that somebody who is 
fighting cancer can actually focus on 
fighting cancer and getting better. And 
that is just wrong. 
In America we need to take care of 
our workers. That is why I think it is 
so critically important that we include 
in reconciliation the paid family and 
medical leave. Unfortunately, most 
workers are forced to give up their 
wages and leave work to deal with 
health crises for themselves or loved 
ones. And this is true especially for 
women and women of color. 
My sister’s story is not unique. It is 
happening to workers across the coun-
try. So I am committed to making sure 
that we fight to keep these provisions 
in the Build Back Better agenda. 
Secondly, caregivers, the home- and 
community-based care system is so 
critically 
important, 
especially 
for 
those on Medicaid and the disabled. 
This very year my own mother was 
able to qualify and get it after being on 
a waiting list for 8 months. It’s not 
easy though, when you need that in- 
home care. This is a program that 
helps patients stay in their homes, as 
many older Americans wish to do and 
can’t, so this program will be ex-
panded.

But we also need to increase wages 
for those who are providing the care, 
because the wages just don’t cut it. We 
know there is a shortage of healthcare 
workers now and providers. I have been 
dealing with this every day. Just last 
night I had to get on a red-eye. 
Why? 
To help provide some of that care. 
So we need this human investment in 
people and to provide that care in 
home. 
We saw what happened with COVID 
and what it did to those in institutions 
and nursing homes. If we can avoid 
that and have people in their homes, 
then we should expand this program 
and support it. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
the American economy has lost more 
than 500,000 jobs in the caregiving in-
dustry, and we are seeing firsthand how 
hard it is to hire. So investing in this 
is going to expand that. It is going to 
make this available to more Americans 
and those in need, whether you are an 
older American, Madam Speaker, or 
you are disabled. 
In conclusion, by investing in fami-
lies and our care economy, we will 
show compassion to those in need, im-
prove care, and help women get back 
into the workforce. The investments in 
the Build Back Better package will be 
meaningful for our families and trans-
formational for our economy. 
Let’s keep them—not cut them—for 
people like my mother who has severe 
Alzheimer’s and for the rest of Ameri-
cans who need that care. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I am 
very impressed that my colleague took 
the red-eye because she was caring for 
her family and she is here tonight car-
ing for her constituents. I hope the 
gentlewoman can go home and get 
some rest. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). My colleague is a great advocate 
for all those in her State and through-
out the country. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I am delighted to be with the gentle-
woman and as well to be fighting for 
what is right, and that is what we are 
doing here today. We are fighting for 
what is right. 
I am amazed when I hear people want 
to try to understand whether or not we 
are on the floor of the House talking 
about a safety net or whether we are on 
the floor of the House trying to create 
a care economy. 
Well, let me be very clear. The clear-
ness of my point is that the care econ-
omy is alive and well. It may be called 
by many names, but it is millions of 
women who have in the decades—some 
without names, some without cat-
egories—have been working to take 
care of people. They have been layered 
from those, as we have heard my sis-
ters and my colleagues indicate, that 
they have been parents who were in the 
last stages of life, they are working 
mothers who need childcare, and they 
are particularly care workers them-
selves who don’t have childcare. 
So the Build Back Better Act is what 
you want, America. 
Many people say: What is in the bill? 
This is what you want. You already 
have gotten portions of the child tax 
cut. It is a credit, but I like to call it 
a child tax cut. That is in there to be 
continued. 
And I have heard the stories from my 
constituents, making ends meet, get-
ting diapers and formula, and paying 
rent to be able to keep a roof over the 
head of toddlers and babies of single 
parents, mostly women. So we know 
how important the child tax credit is. 
But then we talk about childcare and 
when we talk about kindergarten that 
will be universal. These are in the 
early stages of life. So I am excited. 
Let me just mention one deviation, 
Madam Speaker. Let me just mention 
one deviation, and that is that in Texas 
we have got a compounded problem, 
people without childcare and people 
without healthcare because we never 
opted in—I say we—the State Govern-
ment never opted into the expanded 
Medicaid. So we have working parents 
with 766,000 who are uninsured in the 
State of Texas. 
Can you imagine, Madam Speaker, 
working parents with children who 
have no childcare; and they are not in-
sured, and they have no healthcare? 
So can we ease their burden? 
Can we ease their burden? 
Quickly let me ease their burden and 
ensure that—very quickly let me pay 
tribute to a school in Humble, Texas, 
where I met a young woman by the 
name of Aquila Gillespie who runs a 
subsidized childcare facility who des-
perately needs this childcare program 
which is going to allow her working 
parents—they are working parents in 
the care industry—who come to her 
with children at night, who have chil-
dren who are, in fact, in early edu-
cation, meaning that they are first and 
second grade. She works hard to open 
this school because most of the parents 
who enroll them in the school cannot 
afford childcare. These men and women 
are working people, and they work at 
night. 
b 1830 
I stand here to join with my col-
leagues to say, what does America 
want? They want to know that this bill 
is going to help them. You can see how 
colorful it is, Creative Kids. 
And that is Aquila. I want her to be 
known on television because she did 
this as a young woman, a young woman 
who was a single parent at the time. 
She hires and employs mothers and 
others who are in the working class. 
Let me say childcare, America, is 
what you will get with the Build Back 
Better Act. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for 
her comments, and I thank Madam 
Speaker for allowing us to have this 
Special Order hour to talk about fami-
lies in America and what the Build 
Back Better plan will do to make sure 
that families have childcare, have pre- 
K, have the opportunity to go back to 
work. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
REALITY OF THE TAX AND 
SPENDING BILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. OWENS) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
GAETZ). 
THREAT OF ASSASSINATION 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding because I 
think someone maybe trying to kill 
me, and if they are successful, I would 
like my constituents and my family to 
know who stopped their arrest. 
Madam Speaker, on October 8, 2021, a 
Twitter 
handle 
styled 
@CIABobisatyourdoor 
tweeted 
to 
@repmattgaetz: ‘‘Looky here, pal, I 
lived in Portland. Portland has ordered 
a hit on you. I accepted the contract. 
Have a good day.’’ 
Following this tweet, this individual 
traveled to Washington, D.C., and the 
Capitol Police recommended his arrest. 
That is information that was just 
shared with me by the Investigations 
and Threat Assessment section of the 
Protective Services Bureau and, spe-
cifically, 
George 
DiSesso. 
George 
shared with me that the Capitol Police 
recommended the arrest of this indi-
vidual and that the Department of Jus-
tice refused to do so, declined to do so. 
On the eve of the Attorney General 
testifying before the Judiciary Com-
mittee tomorrow, it is just yet another 
example of the Department of Justice 
having a double standard. If my name 
weren’t Gaetz, if it were Omar or Tlaib, 
you bet this person would have been ar-
rested because that is what the Capitol 
Police recommended. But the Depart-
ment of Justice doesn’t seem to care so 
much when it is Republicans. I thank 
my colleague for yielding to me. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, Utah 
is, in the Fourth District, now paying 
more for everything thanks to the 
Biden administration’s disastrous eco-
nomic policies. It is throwing our coun-
try back to a 1970s economy, and there 
is no end in sight. 
The Democrats’ solution? Pack far- 
left policies into their $5.5 trillion 
spending package and tell the Amer-
ican people that it cost them nothing. 
It is a bogus talking point that 
couldn’t be further from the truth. 
In reality, this tax and spending bill 
would perpetuate labor shortages in 
Utah and across the country, which 
will harm economic recovery and hurt 
families in my district; violate Ameri-
cans’ financial privacy by increasing 
IRS access to our personal bank data;

and it will also mandate financial serv-
ices providers to report financial trans-
actions of $200 per week or greater. The 
IRS has no business tracking the 
checking accounts of Americans. 
They will also reduce our country’s 
energy 
independence, 
causing 
gas 
prices to skyrocket nationwide, now, 
by the way, hitting record numbers in 
Utah. 
It will impose devastating taxes on 
small businesses as they attempt to get 
back on their feet. 
President Biden and Democrats in 
Congress want to use this trillion-dol-
lar spending bill to fundamentally re-
imagine our country’s economy, and 
they are going to raise taxes on the 
middle class to make it happen. That 
means higher prices for families at the 
gas pump, in the grocery store, and ev-
erywhere in-between and the highest 
inflation levels we have seen in over 30 
years. 
This fiscally irresponsible spending 
spree places a staggering debt on the 
next generation of Americans and 
leaves our country’s economy worse 
off. 
HONORING TAYLOR HOOVER 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, 31- 
year-old United States Marine Corps 
Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover from 
Utah was killed in the line of duty on 
August 26 by a suicide bomber in 
Kabul, Afghanistan. He was taken too 
soon, heroically assisting the evacu-
ation efforts of U.S. citizens and Af-
ghan allies. 
In his faithful service to others, Ser-
geant Hoover and the 12 other service-
members who were lost on that tragic 
day embodied the military’s core val-
ues: honor, courage, and commitment. 
I pray that they find solace in his 
memory and healing in the love of 
their family and friends. From Hill-
crest High School and all the way to 
Arlington National Cemetery, I know 
this tragic loss will be felt by many. 
We will never forget the sacrifice and 
service of Sergeant Taylor Hoover. God 
bless the Hoover family and all of our 
Nation’s Gold Star families. 
Honoring Todd Grossgebauer 
Mr. OWENS. I would like to honor a 
true public servant and a Utah hero, 
Commander Todd Grossgebauer, who 
lost a hard-fought battle against can-
cer over this last summer. 
Todd was the second employee hired 
by the Riverton, Utah, police depart-
ment. He also served the Provo Police 
Department for 26 years. He studied at 
the FBI National Academy. He was a 
patrol division watch commander and 
instructor at UVU’s Law Enforcement 
Academy. 
Todd and all of our brave men and 
women in law enforcement put their 
lives on the line every single day to 
protect our communities. They truly 
are hometown heroes. 
As we reflect on and honor the sac-
rifices of our law enforcement officers, 
I pledge to always back the blue. I am 
thinking of Todd today and praying for 
his wife, Brenda, and their entire fam-
ily. 
HONORING BRENT JEX 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Brent Jex is a re-
tired police detective of 20 years in the 
West Jordan Police Department and 
served as president of the Utah Fra-
ternal Order of Police since 2012. 
As a member of Utah’s Joint Crimi-
nal Apprehension Team, Brent has par-
ticipated in the arrest of the most dan-
gerous and notorious criminals in the 
Intermountain West. But even more 
impressive is his dedication to advo-
cating for our men and women in uni-
forms’ mental health. 
Right now, even more than ever, our 
officers are under scrutiny and stress 
that none of us can imagine. They have 
a voice with Brent as the president of 
FOP. 
Referring to mental health treat-
ment, 
Brent 
has 
said, 
‘‘Before 
I 
thought it was a sign of weakness to 
have to go seek treatment. Afterward, 
I realized that it is a sign of weakness 
not to.’’ 
Brent represents the best of us. He is 
an invaluable member of the law en-
forcement community and the State of 
Utah as a whole. 
Brent, thank you for all you have 
done and all you do to keep our com-
munity safe. 
HONORING UTAH’S SMALL BUSINESSES 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, like 
many industries across the country, 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
took 
an 
unyielding toll on small businesses. 
Over the past several months, I have 
had the pleasure of visiting hundreds of 
small businesses across my district to 
hear firsthand how they are coping 
through economic recovery. One thing 
is for certain: Utahns are innovative. 
Owlet, located in Lehi, is saving 
countless lives across the country with 
its in-home monitoring system for pre-
natal and newborn babies. 
Greek House is a family-owned and 
-operated restaurant in Taylorsville, 
currently celebrating its first birthday 
in Utah’s Fourth District. 
Local advanced manufacturing com-
panies like Hexcel Company, Rock 
West Composites, Inc., and Advanced 
Composites Inc., are leading in the de-
fense, commercial, and aerospace in-
dustries. 
Neuroxorx in Sandy is providing in-
novative long-term physical, occupa-
tional, and speech therapy for adults 
and children affected by paralysis. 
Grifols in Salt Lake City is a small 
plasma donation center that helps save 
and improve lives across the country. 
These companies and everything in- 
between perfectly showcase the innova-
tive 
and 
service-oriented 
spirit 
of 
Utah’s Fourth District. They think big 
and bold in their pursuit of excellence. 
To every small business in every cor-
ner of Utah’s Fourth District, thank 
you for all you do to save our State. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
REALITY OF THE ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I promise I am not trying to go for the 
record of the most boring for half an 
hour, but if I make it, bless us all. 
Madam Speaker, over the next half 
hour, I am going to try to walk 
through—and a lot of this is just sort 
of the boiling frustration that we all go 
through around here. We are frustrated 
because I believe a lot of our brothers 
and sisters on the left mean well. They 
say warm, fuzzy things. They say 
things that actually should make you 
feel good. And then you actually deal 
with the reality of what is happening 
in our economy and around us. 
We are going to blast through a 
bunch of these and see if I can sort of 
explain our frustration as conserv-
atives but also as Americans. So just 
one quick point. Do you remember all 
of the rhetoric from the last election 
from our Democrat colleagues about 
how they are going to actually do all of 
these things in regard to greenhouse 
gases, but we will still have a healthy 
economy? Well, this is the chart before 
President Biden took office, and you 
see GDP was truly growing and green-
house gases had actually made quite a 
bend and change. 
But now, we actually also have some 
other little facts we are going to have 
to deal with. Think about this: The at-
tacks that happened on 
President 
Trump, but in those 4 years, my under-
standing is use of coal actually fell 30 
percent. 
Well, I have to congratulate the 
Democrats. It looks like this year’s 
coal usage will go up 23 percent. One 
more time: Coal usage will now go up 
almost 23 percent this year because 
they have so screwed up the energy 
economy. 
When you block pipelines, when you 
block the movement of natural gas, 
when you block the much cleaner fuel 
and you need to produce ions, called 
electricity, where do you go? So, con-
gratulations to the Democrats. They 
actually took a trend—where they said 
they wanted this—and have absolutely 
reversed it. 
It is sort of an amazing thought, isn’t 
it, that the Biden administration and 
Democrats did more in the last 9 
months for coal production than the 
previous President did in 4 years? It is 
a fascinating but good example when 
you don’t own a calculator and don’t 
do economics. 
Let’s actually walk through a couple 
of other things. You have also seen the 
reports and the analysis of how many 
poor people are going to absolutely suf-
fer this winter. Have you seen what en-
ergy prices look like? If your household 
that uses heating oil—I am sorry, for 
those of us in the desert, we don’t know 
what heating oil is, but we are told it 
is getting really expensive. Have you 
seen the numbers of what is predicted 
to be paid in cold parts of this country? 
If you are angry about it, go talk to 
your Democrat Representative because

they are the ones that basically, 
through their arrogance and not own-
ing a calculator, not understanding 
basic economics, have just, in many 
areas of the country, will have doubled, 
doubled your heating bill this winter. 
But this is what crappy economics 
looks like. And you start to walk 
through it. How about if you are in one 
of those neighborhoods where crime is 
an issue? Well, you have to thank the 
Democrats once again. You can see 
that homicides are up 16 percent in the 
first 6 months of this year. 
We chose not to use it, but if you ac-
tually look at the concentration of 
where these homicides are, people of 
color are the victims here. 
You know, once again, we hear these 
beautiful speeches behind these micro-
phones of how they are going to help 
and protect and do this, except they 
are killing them. At some point, the 
math is the math. This is sort of the 
Democrat destruction in just the first 9 
months, 10 months of this year. And 
the math is the math. The facts are the 
facts. 
The air is getting dirtier; the power 
bills have gone up; you are less safe. 
But let’s keep walking through more of 
the damage that is being done to our 
country, the society. 
b 1845 
In my State, we have a little prob-
lem. We are a border State. The num-
ber of adult males that are crossing our 
border has skyrocketed. If you actually 
start to walk through what that actu-
ally means—let’s actually take a look. 
Oh, but what about the fentanyl and 
who is that killing? When you take a 
look at the pounds—tonnage, actu-
ally—of dangerous narcotics, particu-
larly fentanyl, that is crossing my bor-
der in Arizona, thank you for the ab-
surd policies that have been adopted by 
the Democrats and this President. 
Is it that you want to kill people? I 
can’t believe that is in your hearts, but 
that is what you have allowed to hap-
pen. 
Let’s actually talk about the other 
side, the economic side, of what the 
Democrats have done in regards to the 
border. Why some of this is important 
is I need you to double it up. We are 
going to come back to the inflation 
here in a second. 
What are the two things you do in a 
society if you want to destroy the 
working poor? You make the value of 
their labor less. And unlike 2018 and 
2019, which we had records in this coun-
try, where if you are part of the work-
ing poor, you are someone that didn’t 
finish high school and what you sell is 
your labor, you were getting dramati-
cally less poor. We know income and 
equality, wages, were all going the 
right direction. 
Now, the Democrats take over, and 
you flood the society with—what was 
today’s final number, 1.7 million, head-
ing towards 2 million—people of mod-
erate to low skill, and do you under-
stand the economic effects of what you 
just did to the working poor in this 
country? 
We have some data that we did a cou-
ple weeks ago on the floor that showed 
that by the end of the decade, you will 
have made the working poor poorer in 
this country, substantially, because of 
opening the border. Now, add in infla-
tion. 
If you actually take a look at the 
real earnings, the real earnings, they 
are negative. People in this country, 
the working poor, the middle class, 
they are getting poorer. Do we care? 
Because it is the math. 
It is nice to give these beautiful 
speeches about how we care, but then 
when you so screw up the basic eco-
nomics of society, when you have now 
devalued their labor by flooding the 
market with similar skill sets, and now 
you have so monetized the society that 
you have cash chasing products and 
goods, and then you screw up the in-
centives to work, what did you think 
was going to happen? 
You wonder where is the compassion 
around here? The working class, that 
middle class, and the working poor are 
getting poorer every day in this coun-
try because of Democrat policies. 
It is a level of cruelty. Can we stop 
the hemorrhaging? Can we stop the 
cruelty to these populations? It is not 
enough to give pretty speeches that 
you care. 
When you start to look at this, when 
you realize the skyrocketing infla-
tion—yeah, it is the highest in 13 years. 
But if you do some of the core goods, 
that if you are on that—I hate the 
term—lower quartile, where substan-
tial portions of your income go to 
transportation, food, and rent, it is 
even higher than this. 
Now, we understand from the econo-
mists, it is no longer considered transi-
tory. This is Democrat policies at 
work. 
A couple weeks ago we tried to do a 
simple explanation of supply side, 
where you use resources, whether they 
be tax cuts or incentives or getting 
regulations right to encourage produc-
tion, and by encouraging production, 
you make people’s labor more valuable 
and they get paid more. But the soci-
ety has more goods and products and 
services to buy, so you don’t set off in-
flation. 
You are now living the Democrat 
stimulus Keynesian model of throw 
lots and lots and lots of cash at it, but 
you did nothing to stimulate produc-
tion. We have lots of cash chasing 
goods now, but at the same time, all of 
that cash also encourages people, say-
ing: Hey, maybe I don’t really have to 
work right now. 
So you have a fall in labor force par-
ticipation, you have lots of cash to go 
buy things, and then you wonder how 
the supply chains get screwed up. You 
wonder how you have inflation set off. 
We are reliving the 1970s. Did anyone 
actually buy a textbook? Seriously. If 
you actually loved and cared for the 
working class, for the working poor, 
you would have been embracing 2018 
and 2019, which were miracles of no in-
flation and dramatic wage growth. 
Yes, the pandemic has been miser-
able, but much of this did not have to 
happen. But it is that arrogance, once 
again, of Democrat policies. And is it 
the darkness of, hey, if we send out lots 
and lots of money in checks, if we are— 
as the Democrats so-called Build Back 
Better plan, which is to take the ma-
jority of our society and put them on 
transfer payments—maybe it is great 
politics. Maybe that is how you become 
the majority party forever. It is really 
crappy economics. 
So if you start to take a look at just 
the last 6 months—you remember a 
couple months ago: This is transitory; 
it is going to stop? Not stopping, not 
stopping. Even the Federal Reserve 
now has updated their numbers. So the 
talking heads were saying, oh, it is 
transitory, give the administration a 
pass. Turns out, we have so struc-
turally screwed up the labor markets, 
we have so structurally failed to pro-
vide the incentives to produce things in 
our own country and massive amounts 
of this liquidity are functionally now 
financing the rest of the world and par-
ticularly China. So congratulations 
once again. 
If you actually start to look—and we 
are going to put up all of these slides 
on our website so folks can actually 
have a chance to sort of dive into 
them—but how prices have changed in 
a year. When you start to understand— 
that is gasoline. This is your fuel oil, 
as we were just talking about; cars. 
But you start to go over the things 
that are sort of the bare necessities for 
so much of our community. We are just 
kicking them in the head. 
Then the arrogance coming out of 
the White House saying, well, these are 
sort of, what was it, high-class prob-
lems? Come on. Is that really where 
the heads of the left are? Their excuse 
is, well—because the basic economics 
are, if you are a person with assets, you 
have a house, you have retirement ac-
counts, you own gold, you own other 
things, you are getting richer. Now, 
your purchasing power is eroding. But 
if you don’t hold assets or you are a 
saver, someone trying to save for re-
tirement, these policies are just de-
stroying your economic future. 
So let’s continue down the line of 
misery 
that 
the 
Democrats 
have 
brought us. If you actually take a look 
at where we were going after the Tax 
Cut and Jobs Act and you started to re-
alize what had happened in wages, par-
ticularly for female participation, we 
had the highest female labor force par-
ticipation in U.S. history. It was off 
the charts, and their wages had begun 
to skyrocket. 
Do we see anything in the Democrat 
proposals that will ever bring us back 
to that? Actually, no. It is actually 
just the opposite. The University of 
Chicago study now makes it look like 
they will incentivize those numbers to 
continue to go the other direction.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5723 
October 20, 2021 
Let’s actually take a look—and we 
started to touch on this. If you are part 
of that working poor, and you start to 
understand that what happens on—if 
you start to break out the world by 
education level—and I know sometimes 
this is uncomfortable, because you sort 
of segment your society. But the re-
ality of it is we actually saw amazing 
wage 
growth, 
just 
amazing 
wage 
growth in 2018, 2019—21-plus percent. 
And that is the very population that 
the pandemic smashed into a wall. Now 
the Democrat policies of inflation, 
opening up the borders, incentivizing 
people functionally not to participate 
in the labor market, they are going to 
destroy—as a matter of fact, they have 
already begun to destroy. 
Let’s look also at the brilliance of 
the left’s proposals of functionally: 
Let’s throw lots and lots and lots of 
cash at the problem and then try to 
figure out why that cash functionally 
is on its way to China to buy things. It 
was not designed to create a robust 
manufacturing backbone in this coun-
try. You actually incentivize people, 
saying, well, go out and buy lots of 
things, engage in consumer—oh, by the 
way, we did nothing in those policies to 
have that become the new backbone of 
productivity and opportunity and jobs 
in our own country. 
The simple proof of this is—have you 
seen the pictures of the container ships 
lined up at the port of Long Beach? 
What do you think is in those? I mean, 
we are living it; we are looking at it. 
Yet the talking heads are incapable of 
trying something new around here, and 
that would be tell the truth. 
So let’s do something that is even a 
little more uncomfortable to talk 
about. Remember when Vice President 
Biden was running for President, and 
repeatedly we were told how if we just 
had a Democrat Presidency and Demo-
crat unified government, we would see 
the deaths—and the deaths are miser-
able and horrible. I have had a couple 
friends die of COVID—but they would 
come to an end and the world would be 
better. 
So we have a new President. He is 
handed multiple vaccines. But how is it 
possible? How is it possible to have 
vaccines available to this administra-
tion, functionally financed and brought 
in policy-wise by the previous adminis-
tration, and then there are more 
deaths this year than there were last 
year? Are the Democrats ready to 
stand up and say: We lied. We made 
crap up. And the results of not telling 
the truth and the way they have ap-
proached the American people about 
the vaccines? Are they going to take 
responsibility for the deaths? Because 
they sure beat the crap out of Repub-
licans and the last President over this. 
Should they live by their own words? 
Let’s talk about the Democrats’ tax 
policy now. We need to tax the rich, 
right? We have done multiple presen-
tations here on the floor saying maybe 
we should stop subsidizing the rich. We 
showed a couple months ago $1.4 tril-
lion over the next 10 years of subsidies 
that go to the rich. In this case, Demo-
crats actually have something bril-
liant, saying—this is a great scam—we 
are going to tax the wealthy, but wink, 
wink, nod, nod, we are going to actu-
ally hand it back to the wealthy in tax 
credits and subsidies. 
Here is a simple example of a family 
that makes $800,000 a year. The Demo-
crats’ tax bill, tax proposal, will hand 
them $118,000 in tax credits, if you just 
buy the right electric vehicle and the 
right solar panels and these things. 
This is absurd. You are taking the 
wealthy in society, you are actually 
blaming them for not paying their fair 
share, even though you already saw—I 
am sure if anyone is literate around 
here, you saw today’s Wall Street Jour-
nal talk about you are not actually 
even getting to the super rich; you are 
actually attacking the high-income 
earning rich, because we tax income; 
we don’t tax wealth. But in this case, 
we are going to build a tax bill saying 
we are going to raise your taxes, but 
wink, wink, nod, nod, we are going to 
hand it back to you in tax credits, as 
long as you buy what the Democrats 
tell you to buy. 
Yet, if you actually look at what the 
design of the Democrats’ tax plan is, 
you must understand by the end of the 
decade, we are all poorer. The society 
is poorer. The working poor are poorer. 
The middle class is poorer. 
We now have multiple studies—and 
we are going to talk about these on a 
number of the slides—where the size of 
the economy actually shrinks. The 
number of people working actually 
shrinks. If you understand our debt 
problem, if we do not have an incred-
ibly robust economic expansion, we are 
in real trouble. Yet, this is sort of the 
dystopian future the Democrats are 
planning for my 6-year-old daughter 
and for every American. 
You understand, when you add in the 
spending proposals, in less than 10 
years, we are going to be running $2.6 
trillion of borrowing every single year. 
So think of that. Nine years from now 
when we are working on the budget, 
just the borrowing package—so in 9 
years, the borrowing package, just to 
finance the spending of baseline gov-
ernment, the entitlements, and the ex-
pansion of entitlements, we will be bor-
rowing $2.6-plus trillion every single 
year. This is the healthy economy we 
were promised? 
b 1900 
So, understand what that means is, 
in less than 9 years, if the Democrats 
get their way, we are at 129 percent of 
debt to GDP, and that is publicly held 
debt. 
Now, you all understand why that 
number is so incredibly important. 
When you strip capital out of society, 
how does the small business get a loan? 
How does the entrepreneur here get a 
loan? How about the person who just 
has a dream and wants to start a busi-
ness in their garage? They have to 
compete with government. 
Is there this bizarre fantasy that 
somehow we are going to monetize it? 
Maybe the fantasy of modern monetary 
theory, which, as you understand, has 
been tried many, many, many, many 
times over history, and it has always 
ended up very badly. 
Do you remember the inflation num-
bers a few boards ago? Welcome to the 
dystopian future that the left is bring-
ing us. Look, the baseline number was 
already crappy. It was over 106 percent 
of GDP. With the Democrats’ addi-
tional proposal, it goes from about 106 
to 129 percent. This is a miserable fu-
ture for this country, and this is being 
brought to you by Joe Biden and our 
beloved Democrat friends. 
I know they mean well; at least, I 
like to believe they do. But they have 
to see these same numbers. Most of 
these are based on CBO projections. 
You start to see other things hap-
pening in society because of Democrat 
policies that really, really are starting 
to take effect right now. We are seeing 
some numbers that we need to under-
stand between now and the end of the 
year. There are some economic num-
bers from us on the Joint Economic 
Committee that are becoming incred-
ibly uncomfortable. 
This is sort of an odd one that popped 
up the other day. It turns out, we are 
having this sudden huge spike of indi-
viduals dropping out of the labor force. 
But what happens when you have a 
substantial spike of folks who are just 
saying, ‘‘I am going to retire’’? 
One of the miracles of 2018, 2019 is we 
saw our brothers and sisters coming 
back into the labor force because wages 
were going up, and there were so many 
opportunities. How can there be a 
world right now where we say we have 
over 10 million open jobs, yet we are 
seeing huge dropouts of the labor mar-
ket? 
This is a chart that basically says we 
had, what is it, 11⁄2 million-plus older 
Americans decide, ‘‘I am going to take 
early retirement.’’ What is so dark 
about this number is a huge, huge, 
huge portion of those have almost no 
savings. 
They are taking early retirement, 
going to live on Social Security in-
stead of what we were seeing in 2018, 
2019 as the economy grew. We were ac-
tually seeing poverty of seniors falling 
because many of them had taken part- 
time or had taken some work. Now the 
reverse trend has happened. 
What has happened in the psyche of 
Americans, of our brothers and sisters 
out there? We are already seeing mil-
lions of Americans of traditional work-
ing age disappearing from the labor 
pool, so they are not counted in unem-
ployment because they are not looking. 
But they are in that baseline number 
we call labor force participation. I 
know this is geeky, but it is really im-
portant. 
You cannot have a growing, healthy, 
prosperous society if you build so many 
disincentives in your public policy that 
not working or dropping out or retiring 
early is where your head is at.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5724 
October 20, 2021 
According to the University of Chi-
cago, the Democrats’ plan to expand 
the child tax credit would cause a mil-
lion and a half workers to exit the 
labor force. On the conservative side, 
we have actually made multiple pro-
posals of how to do some creative 
things with the earned income tax 
credit so you actually help the working 
poor and you make working more valu-
able, more attractive. 
But the Democrats’ proposal is now 
to delink a monthly check from par-
ticipating in society, participating in 
the economy, building skill sets, build-
ing an economic future for yourself, 
your retirement, for your children. 
And now we actually start to see the 
academic studies coming in that we are 
going to lose a million and a half work-
ers just on this one line item. 
It truly is almost dystopian that the 
left can get behind the microphones, 
say these warm, fuzzy things, but the 
economists are sitting there shaking in 
their boots, saying we tried versions of 
this in the 1970s, and it did not work 
well. And now we are doing it in a time 
where our demographics are a real 
headwind and our debt load is crushing. 
We actually have some proof that 
also demonstrates that the President 
and the Democrats said a lot of things 
that just weren’t true because the data 
now is in on the States that ended the 
early, we will call it the SPIF on un-
employment. It turns out they rep-
resent a small portion of this country’s 
population because I think there was 
only, what, 13 States that did it, and 
there are like 20, 23, whatever they are, 
a small percentage of the Nation’s pop-
ulation, but they are over half the job 
growth. 
The data is absolutely clear. The 
States that actually ended the unem-
ployment SPIF, the enhanced unem-
ployment, had dramatically better eco-
nomic growth, job growth. 
Once again, is having a job, is eco-
nomic prosperity, is economic growth 
moral? Because if it is, then what the 
Democrats are doing is absolutely im-
moral. 
You start to see the Byzantine struc-
ture of all the tax hikes that the left is 
proposing, and we may do some of this 
next week. What is so crushing about 
this is to even get close to their spend-
ing requirements, it doesn’t produce 
enough revenues. 
I keep getting asked over and over, 
and saying okay, the Democrats aren’t 
dumb. There are probably a few of 
them that actually do own calculators. 
They have to understand that their 
spending proposal in this environment 
will be incredibly destructive to oppor-
tunity in society. 
We have lots of charts. You need to 
go through these other studies that ba-
sically show the transfer payment 
model the Democrats are pushing ends 
social mobility in this country. If you 
are poor, you are going to stay poor. If 
you are middle class, you stay middle 
class. 
In this country, do you really think 
our societal social fabric is going to 
hold when you have no opportunity to 
move upward and sometimes even 
downward, that we are going to basi-
cally become a European transfer pay-
ment, socialist society; that the class 
you are born into is where you stay, no 
matter how hard you work, the school-
ing you go to, because that stagnation 
is what every study says? 
The other part that is also perverse 
is the Democrats have to also under-
stand 
the 
receipts, 
revenues, 
that 
would be produced by all these taxes 
don’t come close to covering all their 
spending. 
It is obvious. They are setting up our 
country to actually have to do other 
layers of taxes. Are they going to 
sweep retirement accounts? Well, that 
is where a bunch of the cash is. Are we 
basically going to move to a VAT, a 
value-added tax, so each step of produc-
tion we tax? Are you going to have to 
add some sort of tariff or border tax? 
Because right now, none of this works. 
None of the math works. 
The final slide here is a congratula-
tions to President Biden and the Demo-
crats’ policies because they did some-
thing none of us thought was possible. 
Remember when we started this year 
in January, this was going to be one of 
the most robust economic growth years 
in history? There were discussions that 
we were going to be 6-plus percent GDP 
growth. 
As of yesterday, GDP growth from 
the Atlanta Fed calculator is 0.5. One- 
half of one percent is our economic 
GDP projection for this quarter, prov-
ing at some point policies really do 
matter, the people you elect really do 
matter, and the amount of pain this is 
going to cause to so many people be-
cause the opportunity, the growth in 
their wages has now been crushed by 
these policies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Let us pray. 
God of all nations, Lord of all people, 
thank You for this land that has re-
ceived Your blessings. 
Lord, throughout our Nation’s his-
tory, You have saved us from calami-
ties. You have blessed us, even when we 
have failed to live up to our great her-
itage of freedom. 
Today, empower our Senators to pro-
tect and guard the foundations of our 
liberty. Remind them that eternal vigi-
lance continues to be the price we must 
pay for freedom. When our lawmakers 
are weary, replenish them with the in-
spiration of Your presence, as they re-
member Your promise never to forsake 
them. Bellow the flickering embers of 
their hearts until their lives are aglow 
with the fires of patriotism, vision, and

We pray in Your marvelous Name. 
Amen.

ther proceeding en bloc.

pore. Objection having been heard, the

Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you. 
f 
FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for 
over 240 years, the story of American 
democracy has been an inexorable 
march toward universal suffrage—to-
ward the realization of that sacred 
principle that all citizens should have a 
voice in selecting their leaders. 
The grand ideal had humble begin-
nings. At the time of the Constitu-
tion’s ratification, hardly 1 in 10 Amer-
icans would have been even eligible to 
vote. 
If you were not White, not a land-
owner, not a male, and not a Protes-
tant, chances were that the democracy 
did not apply to you; chances were that 
you were cut out of the political proc-
ess. 
It took over two centuries of Ameri-
cans marching, fighting, and dying for 
the promise of freedom to expand to 
our citizens, regardless of race or gen-
der or creed, the right to vote. 
But for every two steps forward, 
sometimes there are those who try to 
pull us one step back. Unfortunately, 
we find ourselves today in the midst of 
such a struggle. 
Across the country, the Big Lie—the 
Big Lie—has spread like a cancer, as 
many States across the Nation have 
passed the most draconian restrictions 
against voting that we have seen in 
decades. If nothing is done, these laws 
will make it harder for millions of 
Americans to participate in their gov-
ernment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7094 
October 20, 2021 
If there is anything worthy of the 
Senate’s attention, if there is any issue 
that merits debate on this floor, it is 
protecting our democracy from the 
forces that are trying to unravel it 
from the inside out. 
That is why this afternoon, the U.S. 
Senate will vote to begin debate on the 
Freedom to Vote Act. 
The Freedom to Vote Act is a bal-
anced, effective, and commonsense pro-
posal that will fortify our democracy 
and protect Americans’ right to vote. 
It sets basic standards for all Ameri-
cans to vote safely and securely, no 
matter what ZIP Code they live in. It 
adopts proven reforms that will protect 
voters from both parties, whether they 
live in blue States or red States or pur-
ple States. It fights back against the 
power of dark money in politics and 
ends the toxic practice of partisan ger-
rymandering. And, all the while, it re-
spects the rightful authority of States 
to carry out their elections. 
At its core, the Freedom to Vote Act 
rests on a simple principle: Americans 
must be able to freely choose their 
leaders, and those leaders must be ac-
countable to the people, not to well- 
heeled donors. 
These are policies all Americans can 
get behind. When was the last time we 
heard Americans cheer about dark 
money in our elections or the perva-
siveness of partisan gerrymandering? 
What sort of voter would willingly 
choose to make voting harder—arbi-
trarily harder—when it should be easy, 
safe, and secure? The Freedom to Vote 
Act would provide long-overdue rem-
edies for all these concerns. 
Now, crafting this bill, as you know, 
Mr. President, was no easy feat. It took 
months of hard work, compromise, and 
gathering feedback from experts on 
sensible policies that have been proven 
to work. I want to thank all of my col-
leagues who dedicated their energies to 
making this moment possible, and I 
want 
to 
especially 
thank 
Senator 
MANCHIN for his hard work over the 
past few weeks. He has reached across 
the aisle to try and find a way for the 
Senate to do its work in a bipartisan 
fashion. I thank him for his commit-
ment to finding bipartisanship on a 
subject that, by all accounts, should be 
bipartisan to its core and has been for 
much of our history. 
Now, today’s vote is a cloture vote 
simply on a motion to proceed. It pre-
sents Senators with a simple question: 
Should the Senate even debate—de-
bate—voting rights? That is what this 
is about, simply a debate and an impor-
tant one to be sure. 
No Republican is being asked to sign 
their name to this or that policy today, 
but they are being asked to come to 
the table and have a discussion and 
allow amendments. I want to be clear. 
If Republicans join us in proceeding to 
this bill, I am prepared to hold a full- 
fledged debate worthy of the U.S. Sen-
ate. The minority will have the chance 
to have their voices heard. 
The Senate has already voted on 
more amendments than in any year 
under former-President Trump, and on 
this legislation, again Republican Sen-
ators would be able to offer amend-
ments. But for that to happen, we have 
to get on the bill today. 
What we can’t accept is a situation 
where one side is calling for bipartisan 
debate 
and 
bipartisan 
cooperation 
while the other refuses to even engage 
in a dialogue. If our Republican col-
leagues don’t like our ideas, they have 
a responsibility to present their own. It 
is ludicrous for any Republican to as-
sert that the Federal Government has 
no role to play in safeguarding elec-
tions when State laws disenfranchise 
American citizens. 
I invite them to read the Constitu-
tion of the United States of America, 
which precisely empowers Congress to 
regulate the ‘‘times, places, and man-
ners’’ of holding elections. I invite 
them to look at modern American his-
tory, when the Senate stepped into the 
breach numerous times when Jim Crow 
States sought to restrict the right to 
vote. 
There is a long and hallowed tradi-
tion of the Senate, often in a bipar-
tisan coalition, working to protect ac-
cess to the franchise, and today our 
colleagues should vote to begin debate 
for how we can add to that legacy. But 
what Republicans should not do—they 
must not do—is squelch any chance— 
any chance—for the Senate to debate 
something as critical, as sacrosanct, as 
American as the right to vote. The 
clock is ticking on our chance to take 
meaningful action. 
Our experiment in democracy has 
been the greatest feat of self-rule in all 
of modern history. We cannot allow it 
to backslide here in the 21st century. 
Today, we have a chance to begin de-
bate on how we can prevent that from 
happening, but Republicans must join 
us in the debate and vote to allow de-
bate to proceed. I urge my colleagues 
to vote yes. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on another matter, BBB, Build Back 
Better, even as we work to push legis-
lation in defense of our democracy, 
Senate Democrats are also making 
good progress on reaching an agree-
ment on President Biden’s Build Back 
Better plan. 
Yesterday, Senate Democrats had a 
very spirited and very positive caucus 
lunch to go over the latest outstanding 
items before we can all reach a deal. 
We walked out of that lunch united in 
our desire to reach an agreement this 
week. I believe we can get it done, and 
I want to thank all my colleagues for 
their leadership, diligence, and focus 
on reaching an end result. We are going 
to keep talking to each other all week 
long until we get the job done. 
Later this morning, I will speak 
again with the Speaker and with the 
White House to go over the latest de-
tails of the President’s proposal. I have 
spoken to the President just about 
every day and Speaker PELOSI several 
times a day about these issues. I will 
continue meeting with my caucus to 
try and keep us all on the same page 
because be on the same page we must. 
Everyone is going to have to com-
promise if we are going to find that 
legislative sweet spot we can all get be-
hind. 
Nobody will get everything they 
want, but no matter what, our final 
proposal will deliver the core promise 
we made to the American people: We 
will take bold action against the cli-
mate crisis while creating millions of 
new, good-paying jobs; we will expand 
economic opportunity and lower costs 
for working Americans; and we will cut 
taxes for working and middle-class 
Americans while asking the wealthy to 
pay their fair share. In short, we will 
deliver on a bill that dramatically im-
proves the lives of millions and mil-
lions and millions of American fami-
lies. 
We are getting closer to an agree-
ment. We want to finalize a deal by the 
end of this week, but we all must keep 
moving together. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, and fi-
nally on nominations, yesterday, I was 
proud to announce my recommenda-
tion of a great New Yorker and a great 
friend to serve as the next U.S. Ambas-
sador to Jamaica, Nick Perry, of my 
hometown of Brooklyn. I cannot think 
of a better person to represent our 
country in Jamaica than Assemblyman 
Perry. If confirmed, he would be the 
first-ever Jamaican-born American to 
hold that post. 
I always ask folks when I am in 
Brooklyn, ‘‘What is the biggest island 
in the Caribbean?’’ I tell them it is a 
trick question. They guess, ‘‘Well, 
maybe it is Haiti; maybe it is Bar-
bados; maybe it is Cuba.’’ I say, ‘‘No, it 
is Brooklyn,’’ which has more Carib-
bean immigrants than anywhere else. 
So Nick Perry’s nomination is great 
news for our community and our coun-
try. For decades, Assemblyman Perry 
has served Brooklyn by doing things 
the old-fashioned way: working hard, 
never resting on his laurels, and earn-
ing the trust of the people he rep-
resents. He is a true American success 
story: an immigrant, a veteran of the 
Army, and a graduate of Brooklyn Col-
lege. I know he will do excellent work 
as our next Ambassador. 
From Patrick Ewing to KRS-One, 
from Vice President KAMALA HARRIS to 
Congresswoman YVETTE CLARKE, to the 
late General Powell, Jamaican Ameri-
cans hold a key place in our Nation’s 
rich legacy. Nick Perry will continue 
adding to this legacy, as he has for dec-
ades, and I am proud to support him as 
a nominee for Ambassador. 
And, finally, today, the Senate will 
also 
move 
forward 
on 
Catherine 
Lhamon to be Assistant Secretary for 
Civil Rights at the Department of Edu-
cation. All her career, Ms. Lhamon has

been an unshakeable champion for civil 
rights and for all students who want a 
fair shake in their education. This 
would be the second time she serves as 
Assistant Secretary, so she has the ex-
perience, the leadership, and the dedi-
cation to stand up for students from all 
walks of life—something sorely lacking 
under the previous administration. 
I look forward to confirming her 
nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
ENERGY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Federal Government’s own analysts of 
the energy sector are predicting that 
this winter American families could 
face home heating bills that are 54 per-
cent higher than last year—54 percent 
higher than just last year. On average, 
the price for our households running on 
natural gas is expected to jump 30 per-
cent. For homes that use propane, a 
different assessment says the forecast 
looks like ‘‘propane-market Armaged-
don.’’ 
As the head of one aid organization 
put it, ‘‘After the beating that people 
have taken in the pandemic, it’s like: 
What’s next?’’ What is next? Well, as-
tonishingly, what is next is yet an-
other 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree from Washington Democrats, in-
cluding more inflationary spending to 
push costs even higher and more anti- 
domestic-energy taxes and regulations 
that would only compound these prob-
lems. 
That includes new, crushing taxes 
aimed at domestic natural gas produc-
tion. They want to reprise the Obama 
administration’s War on Coal. But this 
time the target is also—in addition to 
coal, the target is also the natural gas 
that provides electricity for our com-
munities and heats families’ homes. 
And then there are the new mandates 
and new penalties that are essentially 
designed to make 49 States’ electrical 
grids move more in the direction of 
California’s—paying higher costs for 
less reliable power. 
Now, unfortunately, this has been the 
Biden administration’s playbook going 
back to the very beginning. Remember, 
killing the Keystone XL Pipeline and 
thousands of American jobs was a day 
one—a day one—priority. Then it was 
the ban on new development of domes-
tic energy reserves and the hasty mis-
sion to rejoin the toothless Paris cli-
mate accords, where virtually nobody— 
nobody—but America seems to be re-
motely interested in achieving their 
nonbinding ‘‘commitments.’’ 
So for all the leftwing’s apparent ur-
gency to pass radical climate policy, 
they seem not to care much about 
tackling the biggest sources of the 
world’s carbon emissions. The so-called 
international 
community 
that 
had 
scraped together the failed Paris deal 
could only get the world’s most prolific 
polluter, that is, China, to agree—now, 
listen to this—to curb its increase in 
emissions 9 years from now. That is all 
they got out of China: an agreement to 
curb their emissions 9 years from now. 
That is what this administration 
calls a good deal? America signs up for 
self-inflicted pain today, and China 
maybe—maybe—thinks 
about 
begin-
ning to follow suit in another decade. 
So, 
listen, 
China 
continues 
to 
produce more than one-fourth—one- 
fourth—of the world’s carbon output, 
roughly 21⁄2
times as much as the 
United States. 
Instead of fighting back against our 
adversaries, Democrats’ reckless tax-
ing-and-spending 
spree 
would 
just 
hand-deliver them one big gift right 
after another, like the big new tax 
hikes on American businesses that 
would leave our industries paying high-
er tax rates than businesses in com-
munist China; like doubling down on 
the anti-energy policies that already 
have the Biden administration going 
hat in hand to Russia and OPEC and 
begging them to up their own produc-
tion for us. 
As our colleague Senator BARRASSO 
pointed out yesterday, before the Biden 
administration took over, America was 
enjoying energy independence for the 
first time in seven decades. Before the 
Biden administration took over, Amer-
ica was enjoying energy independence 
for the first time in seven decades, but 
now, we are heading the other way. 
America has doubled our oil purchases 
from 
Russia 
on 
President 
Biden’s 
watch. We are twice as dependent on 
Russian oil today as we were before 
this administration took power. And 
President Biden green-lighted Putin’s 
new gas pipeline that will give Moscow 
even more leverage over the European 
continent. 
So Democrats want our Nation on a 
path toward less energy independence 
and higher costs for working families. 
Their 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree would make it all dramatically 
worse. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on another matter, our country would 
be much better off if our Democratic 
colleagues shelved their radical wish 
list and focused on their fundamental 
responsibilities as a one-party govern-
ment. But while they continue to spin 
their wheels negotiating this reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree, their most 
basic jobs are being neglected. 
This week, already months behind 
the usual pace, the chairman of the Ap-
propriations Committee released par-
tisan drafts of spending bills that are 
dead on arrival. They spend too much. 
They cut our longstanding taxpayer 
protections like the Hyde amendment. 
They shortchange our national defense 
even as we face serious and growing 
threats from terrorism and from major 
competitors like China and Russia. 
Most of these bills can’t earn 50 votes, 
much less 60. 
When Republicans ran the Senate, by 
this time of year, we had had bipar-
tisan frameworks in hand for months, 
and we were hammering out the fine 
details across the aisle. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues are way, way behind 
schedule, with no solution in sight. 
It is also looking increasingly likely 
that we will reach Veterans Day before 
the Senate takes up the National De-
fense Authorization Act—now, never 
mind that this year’s bill earned over-
whelming, bipartisan support in com-
mittee; never mind that it represents 
this body’s single most important op-
portunity to influence national secu-
rity. Our troops are being put in the 
back seat so the socialists can drive 
the car. 
At the end of the month, because 
House liberals still cannot get their act 
together and pass the bipartisan infra-
structure bill, which the Senate passed 
months ago, major highway projects 
and American workers are scheduled to 
be thrown into limbo. 
Our Democratic colleagues have uni-
fied control of the government—unified 
control of the government. The coun-
try needs them to stop arguing among 
themselves over how to waste trillions 
of dollars and get about executing their 
most basic jobs. 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on one final matter, later today, the 
Democratic leader will have the Senate 
vote on the latest iteration of his par-
ty’s election takeover scheme. 
Frankly, I have just about lost count 
of how many times our Democratic col-
leagues have tried to truss up the same 
takeover with new trappings. For mul-
tiple years running, Washington Demo-
crats have offered a rotating merry-go- 
round of rationale to explain why they 
need to federalize voting laws and take 
over all of America’s elections them-
selves, but every time they try this 
shtick in the Senate, it falls flat. 
Today will be no exception. 
This latest umpteenth iteration is 
only a compromise in the sense that 
the left and the far left argued among 
themselves about exactly how much 
power to grab and in which areas. This 
latest bill still subjects popular, com-
monsense election integrity protec-
tions like voter ID to the whims of

Federal bureaucrats. It still sends gov-

money 
to 
political 
cam-
paigns—government money, taxpayers’ 
money, to political campaigns, for 
goodness’ sake. It still puts Wash-
ington in the middle of the States’ re-
districting decisions and on and on. 
The same rotten core is all still there. 
The Senate knows how to make a law 
in a productive, bipartisan way. We 
have done it this year on multiple sub-
jects. We have done it on election 
issues themselves in recent memory— 
the Help America Vote Act 20 years 
ago that Chris Dodd and I put together. 
We did that when there was an actual 
problem that needed solving and an ac-
tual bipartisan process. But as long as 
Senate Democrats remain fixated on 
their radical agenda, this body will 
continue to do the job the Framers as-
signed it and stop terrible ideas in 
their tracks.

VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know 
we are going to be voting soon, but I 
wanted to comment. I hope that Demo-
crats and Republicans can rise above 
party to come together to protect our 
precious right to vote. I know, in 
Vermont, we do that. We make it very 
clear that voting is a right. Everybody 
can vote. We try to make it as clear 
and open as possible. People can be in 
jail for a crime; they still have a right 
to vote. We do not take it from any-
body. You can vote right until the last 
minute. You can get absentee ballots. 
As a result, we have an overwhelming 
vote in Vermont—one of the highest 
percentages in the country. 
Some suggest, well, you do it to favor 
one party or the other. I just point to 
the last election. The Governor and 
Lieutenant Governor are elected sepa-
rately in our State. We elected a Re-
publican as Governor and a Democrat 
as Lieutenant Governor. It went back 
and forth like that all the way across 
the ballot. 
It is just an example that we just 
want people to vote. And the timing 
right now couldn’t be more urgent. In 
the wake of the Supreme Court’s 
Shelby and Brnovich decisions, dozens 
of States are trying to restrict access 
to the ballot for tens of thousands of 
Americans, even millions of Ameri-
cans—minority 
voters, 
the 
elderly, 
rural voters, student voters, the dis-
abled, and others. These are the people 
we protect in my State. 
The threats to the voting rights of 
any American are threats to all Ameri-
cans. Indeed, they are threats to Amer-
ica, itself. 
I am glad the Senate has taken 
much-needed action this week on the 
Freedom to Vote Act. It is a vital piece 
of legislation. It establishes common-
sense rules of the road for voting proce-
dures and ensures equal access to the 
ballot box for all Americans. 
This bill is a compromise version of 
the original S. 1, and I note it reflects 
good faith efforts to broaden support 
for the legislation here in the Senate. I 
look forward to supporting this legisla-
tion on the floor. I can only hope it 
doesn’t fall prey to the knee-jerk par-
tisanship we have seen all too often 
lately in the Senate. 
I am also proud to have recently in-
troduced the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act. That is a bill I have 
long championed and sponsored. This 
legislation would restore the core pil-
lars of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that 
have been gutted by the Supreme 
Court’s damaging and strange Shelby 
and Brnovich decisions. 
But it also would provide critical 
protections to Native American com-
munities across the country, including 
Alaska Native communities. This bill 
would fundamentally restore the Jus-
tice Department’s powers to oversee 
and prevent harmful discriminatory 
changes to voting laws and procedures. 
How can anybody stand up and say, 
‘‘I am a proud American, but I am 
going to let some of these legislative 
bodies do things that will stop other 
Americans from voting’’? 
If you are a proud American and real-
ly mean it, then you want every single 
American—I don’t care what their po-
litical party is, they should be able to 
vote. 
I am working extremely hard to build 
bipartisan support for this bill, which— 
especially the past few Congresses—has 
been overwhelmingly bipartisan. I am 
optimistic we can arrive at a good bi-
partisan compromise that can serve as 
a starting point for continued bipar-
tisan discussions here in the Senate. 
You wouldn’t know it if you listened 
to the partisan sound bites and Twitter 
wars in the modern media era, but this 
goal—protecting our right to vote—was 
never a partisan issue. 
Our hero, a man I loved and was 
proud to serve with, John Lewis, once 
said: 
We all know this is not a Democratic or 
Republican issue. It is an American one. 
Well, truer words haven’t been spo-
ken. John Lewis was absolutely right. 
This is an American issue. If you be-
lieve in democracy, you believe in the 
right for everybody to vote. For those 
of us who run for elected office, I have 
always fought in Vermont to make 
sure everybody could vote, knowing 
that there were some sections of the 
State where there may be a majority 
voting against me. I have always in-
sisted everybody be able to vote. That 
is democracy. 
The core provisions of the act have 
been 
reauthorized 
five 
times—five 
times. Every single time it was with 
overwhelmingly bipartisan support in 
Congress. Republicans and Democrats 
alike voted for it. President Nixon, 
President Reagan, President George W. 
Bush proudly signed Voting Rights Act 
reauthorizations into law. Those Presi-
dents—Presidents 
Nixon, 
Reagan, 
George W. Bush—spoke of the profound 
importance of the landmark law for 
our democracy. 
In fact, just to show how it goes, the 
most recent Voting Rights Act reau-
thorization in 2006—you know what the 
vote was in the U.S. Senate: 98 to 0. 
Some people feel we couldn’t get a 
vote like that to say the sun rises in 
the East. But the fact is, every Repub-
lican, every Democrat said we need 
this to make sure Americans vote. It is 
not a case of saying Democrats vote or 
Republicans vote or Independents vote; 
it is Americans vote and we want all 
Americans to. 
You know, the toxic partisanship of 
American politics today has sadly ob-
scured what has united us across party 
lines for so long. The belief that pro-
tecting our right to vote—the very 
right that gives democracy its name— 
that is bigger than party or politics. It 
is the belief that a system of self-gov-
ernment—a government of, by, and for 
the people—is one that is worth pre-
serving not only today, but for genera-
tions to come. It is the belief the gov-
ernment exists to serve the will of the 
people, not the other way around. 
If I can just wear my hat as dean of 
the Senate—one who has been privi-
leged to serve here all these years—I 
ask Senators, let’s get back to doing 
things the way we have always done 
them: reaching across the aisle in good 
faith, meeting each other in the mid-
dle, legislate to protect the rights of 
the American people. 
Even after all these years, I still have 
faith the Senate can serve as the con-
science of the Nation. I believe it can 
shine a light on the path forward even 
on the most difficult, seemingly insur-
mountable issues. I believe we can do 
that again now on the fundamental 
issue of voting rights. So let’s get to 
work. 
Our 
democracy—indeed 
our 
country as we know it—may very well 
depend upon it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7097 
October 20, 2021 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
complete my remarks prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
week, President Biden’s Chief of Staff 
retweeted a tweet from Harvard econo-
mist Jason Furman describing our cur-
rent economic challenges—notably, the 
growing inflation crisis and supply 
chain issues—as ‘‘high class problems.’’ 
‘‘High class problems.’’ 
Well, I guess working Americans 
struggling to stretch their paychecks 
to cover increases in the price of every-
thing from groceries to gas can com-
fort themselves with the knowledge 
that they are experiencing ‘‘high class 
problems.’’ 
The White House Chief of Staff’s 
tone-deaf tweet was, unfortunately, 
pretty typical of a White House that 
seems eager to minimize or disclaim 
responsibility for most of the problems 
occurring on its watch, whether it is 
the flood of illegal immigration across 
our southern border or the high prices 
Americans are currently facing. 
But as the White House Chief of Staff 
and the President should know, infla-
tion has become a serious problem for 
working 
Americans. 
Inflation, 
of 
course, hits middle- and low-income 
families hard. 
If you are wealthy, price increases 
may be an annoyance, but they are not 
likely to break the budget. If you are 
living paycheck to paycheck, on the 
other hand, price increases may mean 
the difference between making it to 
the next paycheck or running out of 
money mid-month. 
Currently, inflation is costing a typ-
ical household $175 a month, and that 
is according to Moody’s Analytics. 
That may not sound like much to a 
wealthy Democratic politician, but for 
an ordinary American family, it is a 
lot of money. 
That $175 a month may be the dif-
ference between whether or not parents 
can afford to get braces for their 
daughter. It may be the difference be-
tween going to visit family for Christ-
mas or staying home and not seeing 
them. It may be the difference between 
having money for the extras, like fam-
ily dinners at a restaurant or little 
league fees or ballet lessons or just 
being able to cover the bare neces-
sities. 
For families making less than the 
median U.S. income, $100 or more a 
month can be the difference between 
making it to the next paycheck or run-
ning out of money. It can mean the dif-
ference between paying the heating bill 
or going cold during the winter. 
Americans have seen increases in 
food prices and the price of bacon or 
beef or poultry, pork, peanut butter, 
fruits and vegetables, eggs, and the list 
goes on. The price of children’s shoes is 
up. So is the price of furniture and gas 
and electricity and rent. 
A recent AP article entitled ‘‘Winter 
heating bills set to jump as inflation 
hits home’’ noted ‘‘the U.S. Govern-
ment said . . . it expects households to 
see their heating bills jump as much as 
54 percent compared to last winter.’’ 
Fifty-four percent. 
Show me the working family that 
can easily absorb that increase. Infla-
tion happens when you have too much 
money, too many dollars chasing too 
few of goods. 
Democrats helped trigger our infla-
tion situation earlier this year when 
they decided to pour a lot of unneces-
sary government money into the econ-
omy, despite being warned their par-
tisan $1.9 trillion spending bill could 
stoke inflation. 
Now, with inflation clearly becoming 
a long-term problem, Democrats are 
preparing to double down on the gov-
ernment spending with a massive $3.5 
trillion 
tax-and-spending 
bill 
filled 
with priorities like $200 million for a 
park in Speaker PELOSI’s district—a 
park that features luxury housing and 
a golf course—and billions of dollars 
for a Civilian Climate Corps to provide 
government jobs for climate activists. 
The massive government spending 
this bill—the biggest expansion of gov-
ernment, for sure, in decades, maybe in 
history—would authorize would pretty 
much 
guarantee 
that 
our 
country 
would be left with an even more per-
sistent and widespread inflation prob-
lem. 
Flooding the economy with govern-
ment dollars isn’t even the only way 
that the bill will contribute to infla-
tion. The bill also contains big tax 
hikes on businesses, which are already 
raising prices thanks to the higher cost 
of shipping and materials and the chal-
lenges of hiring an adequate workforce. 
Raising taxes on those businesses could 
result in even higher consumer prices 
and/or reductions in the quality of 
services provided to consumers. 
Government revenue for fiscal year 
2021 saw a huge increase, driven in 
large part by tax receipts from cor-
porations 
and 
well-off 
Americans. 
Those are the same companies and in-
dividuals the Democrats like to accuse 
of not paying their fair share. 
But since Democrats’ appetite for 
government spending is apparently in-
satiable, record-high government reve-
nues don’t look likely to stop them 
from passing their huge tax increases 
and driving up prices for consumers 
further. 
Along with the flood of government 
spending Democrats passed in the 
spring, another major contributor to 
our inflation crisis has been supply 
chain bottlenecks. The White House 
has largely failed to do anything to ad-
dress the problem. 
The President finally took one step 
forward when he announced the other 
day that the Port of Los Angeles will 
join the Port of Long Beach in oper-
ating 24/7. 
Well, it is about time. Major ports 
around 
the 
globe 
already 
operate 
around the clock, but here in the 
United States, unions have largely 
stood in the way of round-the-clock op-
erations. And even now, the Port of Los 
Angeles/Long Beach will not be fully 
24/7 for a while. Only one of the con-
tainer terminals is currently open 
around the clock, and then only for 
part of the week. The others are only 
slowly moving toward 24-hour oper-
ations with no deadline in sight. 
Other than moving toward 24/7 oper-
ations in Los Angeles, however, the 
President is doing almost nothing to 
address the supply chain bottleneck. 
Infrastructure 
upgrades 
for 
ports, 
trucking, and rail are stuck in limbo 
while Democrats debate their $3.5 tril-
lion tax-and-spending spree. 
And, while the President’s Transpor-
tation Secretary has talked about loos-
ening trucking regulations, his Depart-
ment is actually pursuing an aggres-
sive regulatory agenda that is likely to 
make transporting goods around this 
country more, not less, difficult. 
And I don’t even want to think about 
the transportation challenges that are 
likely to result from the government 
mandates and regulations that will 
emerge from the Democrats’ $3.5 tril-
lion tax-and-spending spree. 
It is unfortunate that Democrat 
elites cannot seem to grasp that infla-
tion is a serious problem for working 
families and that the solution to our 
inflation problem is not to flood our 
economy with even more government 
money. If Democrats succeed in pass-
ing their reckless tax-and-spending 
spree, high inflation may be the order 
of the day for many, many days to 
come. 
Let’s hope that Democrats think bet-
ter of their spending plans before 
American families end up paying the 
price. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Madam

The VICE PRESIDENT. Good to see

NOMINATION OF CATHERINE ELIZABETH LHAMON 
Mrs. MURRAY. I come to the floor 
today to support strongly the con-
firmation of Catherine Lhamon to 
serve as Assistant Secretary for Civil 
Rights at the Department of Edu-
cation. 
She is extremely qualified for this 
role. In fact, she has served in it before. 
In 2013, Ms. Lhamon was confirmed to 
the same role by voice vote. During her 
past tenure, she demonstrated her com-
mitment to students across the coun-
try as she worked to combat sexual as-
sault on college campuses, protect 
transgender students, reduce the use of 
seclusion and restraint, reduce dispari-
ties in school discipline based on a stu-
dent’s race or disability, and enforce 
civil rights laws to protect students. 
Unfortunately, the previous adminis-
tration took major steps backwards 
when it came to supporting and pro-
tecting students—for example, by sig-
nificantly reducing efforts to enforce 
civil rights protections and rescinding 
important policies to address campus 
sexual assault. 
Now, as we know, the pandemic has 
also done serious damage and worsened 
deep-seated 
inequities 
for 
students 
whose families earn low incomes, stu-
dents of color, English learners, and 
students with disabilities. 
We have a lot of work ahead to fix 
this and help our schools rebuild 
stronger and fairer, which is why I am 
especially 
glad 
to 
see 
Secretary 
Cardona and President Biden working 
so hard to right the wrongs of the last 
administration and support our schools 
through this pandemic. 
I know Ms. Lhamon will be a critical, 
capable partner in those efforts be-
cause not only did she tackle many of 
these challenges in her past service as 
Assistant Secretary, but even after her 
service in the Obama administration, 
Ms. Lhamon continued fighting for 
civil rights through her time as the 
Chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights, her work litigating civil rights 
cases with the National Center for 
Youth Law, and as legal affairs sec-
retary to the Governor of California. 
She currently serves the Biden ad-
ministration as Deputy Assistant to 
the President and Deputy Director to 
the Domestic Policy Council for Racial 
Justice and Equity. 
Ms. Lhamon is a highly qualified 
nominee. She has a long track record 
that proves she is a champion for stu-
dents through and through, and that is 
exactly what our students need. I am 
thrilled to have her returning to the 
Education Department’s Office of Civil 
Rights. I urge all of our colleagues to 
join me in voting for her confirmation. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). The Senator from Kansas. 
FIFA WORLD CUP 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am 
joined on the floor today by my col-
league from Missouri, Senator BLUNT, 
and we rise today to welcome the FIFA 
World Cup selection committee to Kan-
sas City and to express our strong sup-
port for Kansas City’s bid to serve as 
the 2026 World Cup host city. 
I express my gratitude to the leader-
ship of Mayor Quinton Lucas and to 
the leadership of Kathy Nelson from 
the Kansas City sporting authority, the 
president and CEO. 
Our community, our joint commu-
nity—Kansas City, people may know, is 
on two sides of the State line—the Mis-
souri side of the State line and the 
Kansas side of the State line. Some-
times we are rivals, but in many in-
stances, we are allies and friends, and 
that is the circumstance we are here 
today. 
Kansas City boasts a rich history of 
both professional and amateur sports. 
Kansas City is the home of the Na-
tional Collegiate Basketball Hall of 
Fame; the Negro Leagues Baseball Mu-
seum; as well as the 2020 Super Bowl 
champions, the Kansas City Chiefs; the 
2015 World Series champions, the Kan-
sas City Royals; and the two-time 
Major League Soccer Cup champions, 
Sporting KC. It is also the hometown 
of our world-renowned football coach, 
Ted Lasso. 
Sporting KC has energized the re-
gion’s diverse and passionate soccer fan 
base—a fan base that I am confident is 
ready to pack up their bags and head to 
Arrowhead Stadium, the loudest sta-
dium in the world, to cheer on the U.S. 
men’s national team and other nations 
that compete there. 
Soccer has become an even larger 
part of the culture of Kansas City after 
U.S. Soccer’s National Development 
Center officially opened in Kansas 
City, KS, in May of 2018. The NDC is 
the perfect location—the perfect loca-
tion—for any team to recover, practice, 
and 
prepare 
for 
their 
upcoming 
matches. 
Spanning more than 50 acres, this 
81,000-square-foot, 
state-of-the-art 
practice, education, and medical facil-
ity includes three natural grass fields 
and two artificial turf fields, with a 
two-story 
coaching 
pavilion, 
and 
houses the Children’s Mercy Sports 
Medicine Center. 
Kansas City has been host to other 
major sporting events. The city regu-
larly welcomes thousands and thou-
sands of fans for events such as the Big 
12 men’s NCAA basketball champion-
ship and the NCAA March Madness and 
will be the location for the 2023 Na-
tional Football League—the NFL— 
Draft. 
Due to major investment in Kansas 
City’s transportation and infrastruc-
ture—something that both Senator 
BLUNT and I and our colleagues, Sen-
ator HAWLEY and Senator MARSHALL, 
have worked on—Kansas City is well 
equipped to support soccer fans from 
around the globe. They will be wel-
comed at a brandnew Kansas City 
International Airport, which is cur-
rently undergoing a $1.5 billion renova-
tion restart for a state-of-the-art ter-
minal that is scheduled to be com-
pleted in 2023. 
In 2020, Kansas City also became the 
first major metropolitan area to offer 
bus transportation free of charge. Addi-
tionally, the Kansas City Streetcar of-
fers free fares with stops just a short 
walk from many magnificent dining 
and dynamic entertaining experiences 
in Kansas City. 
Early in my postcollege career, I had 
an office in downtown Kansas City. The 
circumstances of Kansas City today 
and that long time ago when I was a 
worker in downtown Kansas City are 
significantly different. The entertain-
ment opportunities are immense—the

arrival of a major, magnificent Sprint 
Center; hotels, new, large, elegant—all 
have arrived in Kansas City in just the 
last few years. 
I am confident the entire Kansas City 
region is ready to make the 2026 FIFA 
World Cup a resounding success and is 
excited to add this prestigious tour-
nament to its sporting history. 
Again, we welcome the World Cup se-
lection committee to Kansas City 
today and to the State of Kansas and 
to the State of Missouri. We welcome 
them. They are being welcomed to a 
world-class city known for its heart-
land hospitality. 
I yield to the Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my good friend Senator MORAN 
for actually all he has done to try to 
make it possible to see the FIFA World 
Cup games come to Kansas City. 
This is the biggest sporting event in 
the world. Frankly, soccer has become 
a bigger part of the entire American 
society. Kids are playing soccer out 
there before they can really focus on 
which way the soccer ball is supposed 
to go. There is maybe nothing more fun 
than watching the 3- and 4-year-old 
soccer match just to see what happens 
in that match. But around the world, it 
is important. It is important where 
Jerry and I live. Giant banners with 
the phrase ‘‘We Want the Cup’’ are 
proudly displayed on buildings. They 
are on the streetcar. They are every-
where you want to look. The Kansas 
City 
Chiefs’ 
quarterback, 
Patrick 
Mahomes, and the Royals’ catcher, Sal-
vador Perez, are leading the charge to 
bring the World Cup to Kansas City. 
There is no question that sports are a 
major part of where we live, profes-
sional and nonprofessional. The Wom-
en’s World Cup in 2019 was celebrated 
by fans watching games in the Power & 
Light District. They were broadcast on 
TV all over the world. Watching Kan-
sas City fans watch the World Cup, we 
saw hundreds of thousands of fans flood 
the streets to join the Kansas City 
Royals in celebrating their World Se-
ries title in 2015. We saw an incredible 
crowd when the Kansas City Chiefs 
brought home the Lombardi Trophy in 
2019. In 2023, Kansas City will host the 
NFL Draft. 
So if our friends from the World Cup 
selection team are watching, there are 
others things that have happened to 
give evidence to the great sports heart-
beat of Kansas City. There is plenty to 
look at and plenty to see. We have the 
infrastructure we think we need to 
meet that world sporting event.

Senator 
MORAN mentioned, is top notch. It is a 
great place for fans. It is a great place 
to feel the sense of the game and what 
can happen there. Local leaders have 
done everything they could, I think, to 
secure the right kind of practice fields, 
the right kind of facilities. Children’s 
Mercy Park would be one of those. In 
2021, the Concacaf Gold Cup was hosted 
there. 
Mayor Quinton Lucas is here today. 
In fact, he is here watching us today 
from the Gallery. He is here advocating 
for all things Kansas City but is a par-
ticular advocate for seeing this world- 
class event come to Kansas City. 
Location is another advantage we 
have. We are right in the middle of the 
country. We are close to the host cities 
in Canada and in Mexico that would be 
part of this event. I think we are better 
positioned than the other 16 cities to 
really move forward on this bid. 
The new airport, as Senator MORAN 
mentioned, will be welcoming to who-
ever comes to this event if they come 
to Kansas City. They are going to be 
pleased with that facility. 
There are lots of opportunities in 
Kansas City to spend your free time 
and enjoy what we get to enjoy all the 
time: the famous barbecue, the world- 
class museums, the Negro Leagues Mu-
seum in Kansas City, the Nelson-At-
kins art gallery. There is really a vi-
brant nightlife and music scene in Kan-
sas City today. 
Nearby States have agreed that Kan-
sas City is the right choice. It has be-
come the Midwest choice for this 
event. In May, associations that rep-
resent 310,000 youth soccer players, 
coaches, and referees from the Midwest 
came together to endorse the Kansas 
City bid. 
The financial benefits are obviously 
benefits that we would be excited about 
if we get a chance to host this. Accord-
ing to the Kansas City Sports Commis-
sion CEO and president, Kathy Nelson, 
the economic impact on the region 
could be up to $1 billion. 
With a rich sports culture, endless 
entertainment options, strong infra-
structure, and an easily accessible cen-
tral location in our country, Kansas 
City is the right choice for the 2026 
FIFA World Cup host city, and Senator 
MORAN and I and our colleagues from 
Kansas and Missouri endorse this effort 
and are glad that the selection team is 
looking today at what they are going 
to get if they decide to come to Kansas 
City. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, right 
now, the end of the pandemic may be— 
I underline ‘‘may be’’—within our 
reach. The Delta surge is finally wan-
ing. Over the past month, coronavirus 
case numbers have fallen by more than 
40 percent, thank goodness. The aver-
age number of daily vaccinations has 
increased by more than 25 percent—not 
an 
unrelated 
statistic—and 
COVID 
death rates are finally starting to de-
cline. These are all promising develop-
ments, and they demonstrate that 
President 
Biden’s 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus is working. 
But as winter approaches, we need to 
ask ourselves a serious question: Will 
we continue to take the steps that are 
necessary to save lives and beat this 
virus once and for all? Or will we do 
nothing, as some of our Republican col-
leagues seem to urge, and allow the 
pandemic to come roaring back for an-
other deadly wave? 
Millions of American families have 
already suffered the consequences of 
denial, deception, and inaction. A re-
port released earlier this month found 
that since June—just since June—near-
ly 100,000 American lives could have 
been saved if there were more vaccina-
tions. But we can save the next 100,000 
lives in America if we rally behind the 
President’s call for his vaccination pol-
icy. The American people are already 
with him. The majority of people sup-
port mandating COVID–19 vaccinations 
for students 12 and up. 
Business owners across the country 
have followed President Biden’s lead by 
instituting their own vaccine man-
dates. They have helped increase vac-
cination rates by more than 20 percent. 
In Texas, where the Governor is seek-
ing to outlaw vaccine mandates, one 
hospital CEO said that requiring his 
workers to be vaccinated is ‘‘unequivo-
cally . . . the best decision we ever 
made’’ and that 98 percent of his staff 
has now been vaccinated. 
President Biden’s vaccine policy is 
supported by parents and business own-
ers alike because they recognize a very 
simple truth: The only way to keep our 
kids in school, keep our economy on 
the road to recovery, and stop the 
spread of this deadly virus is vaccina-
tion. A do-nothing strategy is deadly 
and disastrous for our economy. Yet 
that is exactly what many of our Re-
publican colleagues continue to pro-
pose that we do: nothing. It is the same 
response they had earlier this month 
when it came to raising the debt limit. 
Let me reflect for a moment on the 
effort that is underway by State attor-
neys general. The Republican attor-
neys general across the United States 
represent 24 different States. They 
have threatened to file lawsuits to try 
to stop vaccine mandates and mask re-
quirements. 
I think it is fair to take a look at the 
period of June 15, 2021, to September 15, 
2021, and ask how the States are doing 
represented by these attorneys general 
who are fighting President Biden’s 
coronavirus policy. Well, we took a 
look at the average of the 24 States 
that are threatening these lawsuits. 
Their infection rate is more than twice 
than all the other States’. So the peo-
ple in their States where they are sup-
posedly fighting for their well-being 
are losing when it comes to the infec-
tions of coronavirus. 
How about the death rates? Of the 24 
States in this period of time threat-
ening lawsuits, we have a death rate al-
most three times the death rate in the 
other 26 States. The vaccination rate is 
lower in the 24 States represented by 
these Republican attorneys general. 
So what are they winning? Some po-
litical war? What the heck difference 
does it make who wins a political war 
when we are talking about a life-and- 
death issue? And that is frankly what 
we are faced with. 
When it comes to the debt limit, we 
see the same negative default approach

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7100 
October 20, 2021 
by the Republicans. Senate Repub-
licans were ready to let go of the steer-
ing wheel and swerve into oncoming 
traffic with the debt limit. Right up 
until the eleventh hour, they wanted to 
use the filibuster to block Democrats 
from addressing the debt, the limit of 
the debt. Do you know when that debt 
was incurred? It was incurred during 
the Trump administration, with many 
of these same Republicans voting for 
the spending that stands behind it. 
Now the minority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, has once again pledged 
that Republicans refuse to lift a finger 
to deal with the debt limit when it ex-
pires in the first week of December. 
Think for a moment what defaulting 
on the debt would mean to American 
families. It is fodder for even more in-
flation. 
So don’t come to the floor with your 
posing for Holy pictures on the issue of 
inflation and then turn around and say: 
I don’t care what happens to the debt 
limit. Americans will pay more each 
month because of that for their mort-
gages and credit card bills and student 
and car loans. Fifteen trillion dollars 
in household wealth and retirement 
savings would be wiped out if Senator 
MCCONNELL and the Republicans have 
their way in the first week of Decem-
ber. 
If our Republican colleagues are 
truly concerned about the economic 
well-being of America, work with us to 
put together a sensible response to the 
debt limit. Senator SCHUMER and the 
Democrats have said to the Repub-
licans: If you won’t lead, if you can’t 
follow, then get the heck out of the 
way. Democrats, with a majority vote, 
will enact a new debt limit. We under-
stand our responsibility to this Nation. 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. President, ‘‘denial,’’ incidentally, 
seems to be the watchword on the Re-
publican side. Certainly it is when it 
comes to climate change. Some of our 
Republican colleagues insist, despite 
all of the evidence, that climate 
change is a phony, fake news, a hoax. 
Others acknowledge it is real but say 
we just can’t afford to do anything 
about it. In fact, what we can’t afford 
to do is nothing. Climate change is 
here, and the cost of it is disastrous. 
One in three Americans live in a 
county that has been hit by an extreme 
weather event this summer—one in 
three—with family homes consumed by 
wildfires, farms ravaged by unprece-
dented droughts, and lives lost in 
floods of Biblical proportion. 
Last year, our Nation was hit by 18 
climate disasters costing at least a bil-
lion dollars each—18. The total tab for 
climate-related disasters that year was 
$95 billion. This year is worse. Remem-
ber Hurricane Ida? It caused $100 bil-
lion in damages. Think about that. One 
storm: $100 billion. 
And don’t believe that that is just a 
matter of private citizens contacting 
their insurance companies. You can bet 
that 
the 
Federal Government and 
many State and local governments will 
be investing heavily to overcome the 
damage that has been done. 
Climate change is the gravest threat 
to our economy, bar none—not to men-
tion our children’s and grandchildren’s 
future. We have waited too long. Cli-
mate change must be addressed today. 
Tomorrow is too late. Delay and denial 
would not make it disappear. They will 
only increase the damage and lessen 
the opportunities for solutions that we 
might consider. 
America is the world’s can-do Nation. 
We are the Nation who looks at prob-
lems and says: We can fix it. And here 
is something that our Republican col-
leagues either don’t get or won’t 
admit: Dealing with climate change 
has the potential to be the biggest job 
creator in generations. We have an op-
portunity to put millions of Americans 
to work building a sustainable, resil-
ient future for our country. 
Let me give you a recent example 
from last week. I had a chance to meet 
with the public transit officials in 
Champaign-Urbana, 
IL. 
Of 
course, 
Champaign-Urbana, IL, is home to the 
University of Illinois. They were there 
to showcase a new zero-emissions bus 
and a charging infrastructure that is 
cutting edge. You see, these buses run 
on hydrogen fuel cells powered by solar 
energy. They will save tens of thou-
sands of gallons of diesel fuel and pre-
vent more than 130 tons of greenhouse 
gas emissions every single year. 
Imagine if every city in America fol-
lowed the lead of Champaign-Urbana, 
reconstructing their public transit sys-
tem, making them sustainable and de-
pendable. Think of all the Americans 
we could put to work assembling buses 
and trains, building charging stations, 
training workers to maintain and re-
pair these fleets. 
That is what President Biden’s bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill will help do. It 
is the largest infrastructure proposal 
in decades, and it will invest billions in 
green transit alone. 
And, for the record, the previous 
President, Republican President Don-
ald Trump, had no transportation 
package. He talked about it in the 
campaign, and for 4 straight years he 
delivered nothing. 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
agenda is also an investment in our fu-
ture. If you are worried about our 
worker shortage—and you should be— 
the Build Back Better plan will enable 
parents, especially mothers, to return 
to work by making safe and affordable 
childcare resources and senior care 
available for every family in this coun-
try. And it is a blueprint for America 
to win the 21st century and boost every 
family’s economic security by invest-
ing in schools, education, and first- 
class job training. 
Continuing to do nothing while China 
and our other competitors pass us by is 
a strategy for finishing in second place, 
which appears to be the Republican 
strategy. Our Republican colleagues 
say: We just can’t afford to invest in 
America’s workers, families, and eco-
nomic potential. Boy, are they wrong. 
What we can’t afford is to do nothing— 
nothing. 
That is what they did when it came 
to the American Rescue Plan. Not a 
single Republican would support our ef-
forts for the American Rescue Plan to 
address the COVID–19 crisis. 
The vaccination program, which has 
vaccinated most of Americans and con-
tinues to do even more, was funded by 
that program. Money was in that pro-
gram to help businesses get back on 
their feet after the pandemic. It was a 
real investment in the future of Amer-
ica. Unfortunately, it did not have sup-
port from the other side of the aisle. 
NOMINATION OF TANA LIN 
Finally, Mr. President, on another 
matter, this week, the Senate is going 
to vote to confirm Tana Lin to serve on 
the U.S. District Court for the Western 
District of the State of Washington. 
Ms. Lin is an accomplished litigator 
whose credentials, skills, and decades 
of experience have prepared her for this 
assignment. If confirmed, she would be 
the first Asian American to serve on a 
Federal district court in the State of 
Washington. 
She graduated from Cornell Univer-
sity and New York University School 
of Law and began her career here in DC 
as a public defender. She then contin-
ued defending the rights of the most 
vulnerable as a trial attorney in the 
Civil Rights Division of the Justice De-
partment. 
Following her time there, she moved 
to my home State of Illinois to work in 
the Chicago district office of the U.S. 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission. She litigated cases under title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act, age dis-
crimination cases, and the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. 
Today, Ms. Lin works as an attorney 
in private practice, where she pri-
marily litigates cases involving anti-
trust, consumer protection, the envi-
ronment, and labor and employment 
issues. And as a pro bono civil rights 
attorney, she has combated racial dis-
crimination, advocated for religious 
accommodations in the workplace, and 
helped protect our elections from polit-
ical interference. 
Her nomination is another example 
of the Biden administration and Senate 
Democrats working together to ad-
vance highly qualified judicial nomi-
nees. 
Ms. Lin received a unanimous—unan-
imous—rating of ‘‘well qualified’’ from 
the American Bar Association, and she 
has the strong support of her home 
State Senators, MURRAY
and CANT-
WELL. 
I urge my colleagues to support Ms. 
Lin’s historic nomination. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7101 
October 20, 2021 
of a friend, an Alaskan, a gentleman: 
Chuck Bundrant. He was the founder 
and the majority owner of Trident Sea-
foods and a fisherman who really for-
ever changed the seafood industry in 
Alaska. 
Employing 
thousands 
of 
people 
across Alaska and the country and 
processing hundreds of millions of 
pounds of finished seafood products 
each year, Trident is the largest 
vertically 
integrated 
seafood 
har-
vesting and processing company in 
North America today. 
The company—and, really, by exten-
sion, Chuck Bundrant—has been crit-
ical in giving the rest of the United 
States and the world a taste of Alas-
ka’s 
delicious 
and, 
of 
course, 
sustainably managed wild seafood. 
Chuck has a pretty interesting story. 
He didn’t grow up in Alaska. He didn’t 
even grow up near the ocean. He was 
born in Tennessee. He was raised there 
and in Indiana. He had initially hoped 
to pursue veterinary medicine and en-
rolled in a pre-veterinary program at 
Middle Tennessee State University. 
But by the winter of 1961—19 years 
old; he has $80 in his pocket—he and a 
few friends drove from Tennessee to Se-
attle with the thought that they would 
make it up to Alaska. At that point in 
time, he didn’t have any experience, 
any exposure to the State. Apparently, 
he had watched the John Wayne movie 
called ‘‘North to Alaska,’’ and that 
kind of spurred him. 
But he had heard that there were 
some pretty lucrative opportunities 
within the fishing industry, but he also 
knew that finding a job wasn’t going to 
be an easy task. So, apparently, his 
buddies reconsidered the merits of the 
trip, but Chuck doubled down and con-
tinued on his way to the dream of 
working in The Last Frontier. 
So, according to legend, he spent his 
first summer in the State working 
wherever he could in the Bristol Bay 
fishing industry, even sleeping under a 
boat on the docks. He eventually got a 
job busting freezers—which, for col-
leagues, means literally banging metal 
pans to knock loose the blocks of fro-
zen shelled crab—and he was out on a 
floating processor anchored near Adak 
out in the Aleutians. 
Like so many who have the chance to 
come and visit Alaska, Chuck wasn’t 
satisfied with just one quick stint in 
the State. He turned his journey north 
into a 12-year learning experience— 
and, really, a lifelong business. 
By 1965, he had worked his way up 
from the freezer hold to buying his 
first crab fishing boat. As Chuck 
gained more experience in and under-
standing of the crab fishery, he noticed 
that there was an inefficiency in the 
way that the industry operated. After 
bringing in the harvest, most fisher-
men would then head back to shore to 
hand it off to the shoreside processing 
outfits, where the crab meat would be 
removed from the shells and then sent 
to market. And just a lot of back and 
forth here meant that the fisherman 
loses valuable time at sea. And this is 
where Chuck’s ingenuity really struck. 
In the early 1970s, he and two other 
crab fishermen, Kaare Ness and Mike 
Jacobson, 
used 
whatever 
collective 
earnings they had at that point in time 
and they built the Billikin, which was a 
135-foot boat with both crab cookers 
and freezing equipment that allowed 
for immediate onboard processing. So 
this was new. This was novel at the 
time. 
Chuck pushed on. He kept fishing and 
processing on the Billikin. There were 
protests from other Bering Sea crab 
fishermen who were in the middle of a 
strike to secure better prices from 
processors. Around this same time, he, 
Kaare, and Mike partnered with an-
other individual, Edd Perry and his 
Bellingham-based company San Juan 
Seafoods. And this was, really, the be-
ginning of Trident Seafoods in 1973. 
Trident’s early years coincided with 
a phaseout of foreign fleets from the 
North Pacific harvest due to the enact-
ment in 1976 of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act—we know it as the MSA—and, 
also, a burgeoning Japanese market for 
Alaska frozen fish, salmon, and her-
ring. So Chuck and his colleagues took 
advantage of this opening. They built a 
fleet of mobile processing vessels that, 
really, very quickly made their mark 
on Alaska fisheries. 
Chuck’s 
competitive, 
resourceful 
mentality, again, proved useful as king 
crab numbers and harvest started to 
decline in the early 1980s. In the seven-
ties, he had watched giant Japanese, 
Korean, and Norwegian trawling ves-
sels rake in billions of pounds of pol-
lock from the Bering Sea. And then 
with the enactment of the MSA in 1976, 
it extended U.S. fisheries jurisdiction 
to 200 miles offshore, giving American 
fishermen priority access to stocks of 
abundant fish, like pollock, that inhab-
ited Alaska’s coastal waters. 
There was a significant market op-
portunity for pollock in Japan, but in 
America at the time, pollock was kind 
of considered a junk fish, a trash fish. 
And what is more, American boats and 
processors did not have the equipment 
to harvest pollock, to extract its roe 
that was very popular in Japan, and to 
transform its flesh into commonly con-
sumed surimi paste and fillets. 
But Chuck saw things with a vision. 
He saw this as an opportunity and not 
pollock as a trash or poor investment. 
He studied Japanese methods for catch-
ing 
and 
processing 
pollock. 
He 
strategized about how Trident could 
enter this market and, in 1981, he took 
a pretty bold move. He built a plant on 
a very remote Aleutian island, Akutan, 
for onshore processing of crab; salmon; 
and, of course, pollock. 
So Chuck really took a risk there. 
He, after years of trying to convince 
food wholesalers and restaurant owners 
to take a chance on pollock, was able 
to secure a pretty pivotal deal between 
Trident and Long John Silver’s. This 
was the first major contract to bring 
the fish to U.S. market. And this deal 
didn’t take place in some fancy res-
taurant in some major city. This deal 
took place out in Akutan—the Akutan 
processing facility that he had taken 
this chance on back in 1981. 
So companies like McDonald’s, Burg-
er King soon followed Long John Sil-
ver’s in replacing cod and whiting with 
very tasty, and now cheaper, pollock. 
And these companies have grown to be-
come some of Trident’s biggest cus-
tomers. Odds are that if you have tried 
their fish and chips or fish sandwiches, 
you have probably tried Trident prod-
uct. 
Today, Seattle-based Trident oper-
ates a fleet of 40 vessels, including 
catcher 
processors, 
trawlers, 
crab 
boats, tenders and freighters; 11 proc-
essing plants in Alaska—so good jobs 
in Alaska—5 processing plants in Wash-
ington State, Georgia, and Minnesota. 
It offers a host of frozen, canned, 
smoked, and ready-to-eat seafood prod-
ucts; 
and 
its 
harvest-and-business 
model means they know exactly where 
its products come from. That is impor-
tant to us. 
But as Trident has grown and pro-
pelled the industry forward, Chuck re-
mains steadfast in his commitment 
that Trident remain a family business 
that supports its employees and the 
independent fishermen that it partners 
with. Chuck’s son Joe now serves as 
the company’s CEO. He has continued 
his dad’s efforts to seek out new value- 
added products that can be created 
from Alaska fish. 
It is always a good story, I think, to 
know of these very successful busi-
nesses that keep grounded with the 
base from which they began; and with 
Chuck, it was really important that his 
family continued to be part of this suc-
cess story. 
I am told that Chuck had some pret-
ty strict rules, that if any of his 
grandkids—and I think he has about 13 
of them—if any of them decide that 
they want to work for the family busi-
ness, you first have to earn a college 
degree, which Chuck did not have; but 
they also had to spend at least 4 years 
working someplace else other than Tri-
dent; and they had to have cut their 
teeth and fished at least two summers 
in Alaska. 
So he wanted to make sure that you 
weren’t just going to get the job just 
because you were a member of the fam-
ily. You worked for it; you knew what 
this was all about. 
It really is difficult to overstate the 
impact that Chuck has had on his fel-
low fishermen. Beyond the industry in-
novation that he drove, he always 
sought to pay it forward, to offer 
younger 
fishermen 
the 
same 
mentorship and support that allowed 
him to get his start in the 1960s and the 
seventies and to make Trident the 
company that it is today. 
And 
this 
dovetails, 
really, 
with 
Chuck 
Bundrant’s 
commitment 
to 
charitable giving. He was generous in 
so many, many different ways. He

raised and donated money for the vic-
tims of the Tohoku earthquake, the 
tsunami in Japan, Hurricane Katrina, 
Superstorm Sandy, and contributed to 
multiple cancer research foundations. 
I have certainly seen his generosity 
as he has shared in ways that dem-
onstrate his compassion, his care. His 
influence on the fishing community is 
really clear from the outpouring of 
love and support that he has received 
since he was diagnosed with an atypi-
cal form of Parkinson’s. 
In September of 2019, four of the cap-
tains from the TV show the ‘‘Deadliest 
Catch’’—all of whom considered Chuck 
a mentor, a friend, and, really, an in-
spiration—co-hosted what they called 
Captains for a CURE fundraiser. It was 
an auction for the northwest chapter of 
the American Parkinson’s Disease As-
sociation. They raised nearly $380,000 
at the event, and this money goes to-
wards a Parkinson’s disease research 
grant in Chuck’s honor—again, trying 
to shine a light on the specific form of 
disease that Chuck lived with. 
I received a note from Joe Bundrant 
on Sunday, when Chuck Bundrant 
passed from this Earth, and I wanted to 
share just a couple sentences from a 
personal email. He says: 
Dying is not easy, but Chuck was up to the 
task and faced death on this earth as he 
faced rogue waves in Alaska: head-on with 
dignity, determination and with the faith 
that he would be safe in God’s hands. 
He goes on further to say that ‘‘he 
lived each day fully, driven by the val-
ues of integrity, loyalty, hard work 
and most importantly faith.’’ 
And so as I have reflected on the life 
of, really, an extraordinary man, it 
strikes me that, at the end of the day, 
this individual, Chuck Bundrant, was a 
family man, cared for his family deep-
ly; but he, at the base of it, was a fish-
erman. And he lived his life in a way 
that really speaks to the values of in-
tegrity; loyalty; hard work; and, most 
importantly, faith. 
To his family, to his wife Diane: 
Know that our hearts are with you. We 
thank you for sharing a truly honor-
able man with so many of us. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
HONORING OFFICER RYAN HAYWORTH 
Mr. 
TILLIS. 
Mr. President, this 
weekend, thousands of law enforcement 
officers and their families came to our 
Nation’s Capital to celebrate Police 
Weekend. And while Americans were 
paying tribute to our men and women 
in blue here in DC, North Carolina, 
once again, received the tragic news of 
a brave officer lost in the line of duty. 
Officer Ryan Hayworth was only 23 
years old. He had a bright and prom-
ising future ahead of him. He tragically 
lost his life on Sunday night, just 3 
months after joining the Knightdale 
Police Department. 
He and his training officer were in-
vestigating a single-vehicle incident on 
Interstate 540 when a drunk driver 
crashed into their parked SUV, taking 
Officer Hayworth’s life. 
Cody Hagler—his training officer— 
was seriously injured and remains hos-
pitalized; but, thankfully, he is ex-
pected to recover. 
This senseless tragedy is another re-
minder of the constant dangers our 
brave men and women in law enforce-
ment face every single day. A routine 
call to respond to an accident resulted 
in a young officer losing his life in the 
line of duty. 
Although he was only 23 years old, 
Officer Hayworth already had a distin-
guished record of service. He served in 
the U.S. Army, and then in the Na-
tional Guard. And then he answered 
the call once again by becoming a po-
lice officer. 
It is not surprising to anyone who 
knows the Hayworth family, though. 
Officer Hayworth’s father was a long-
time chief of the Zebulon Police De-
partment, and his brother is a fire-
fighter. 
A member of his family church told a 
local news outlet: 
He wanted to be a police officer like his 
dad. They’re good, God-fearing people. They 
care about the community and it’s sad some-
thing this tragic happened the way it did. 
Knightdale Police Chief Lawrence 
Capps has noted the high standards Of-
ficer Hayworth met and exceeded as a 
new member of the force. 
Police Chief Capps said: 
When we hire police officers, we are look-
ing for individuals that embody the best of 
this profession—all that is good, all that is 
wholesome, all that is pure, all that is right-
eous, and Ryan embodied those things. 
It is no surprise to see the outpouring 
of support to honor Officer Hayworth. 
People from across the State have 
stopped by the Knightdale Police De-
partment to place flowers at a memo-
rial created by his colleagues. Other 
local police departments are now as-
sisting the Knightdale Police Depart-
ment in their patrols during this dif-
ficult time. 
I am grateful that the vast majority 
of North Carolinians truly appreciate 
the service and the sacrifice of law en-
forcement. They recognize the men and 
women serving are good people who put 
their uniforms on every day and take 
extraordinary risks to protect others. 
Officer Hayworth is an officer who 
took those risks to protect others, and 
he made the ultimate sacrifice in doing 
so. 
I 
know 
the 
community 
of 
Knightdale will never forget his service 
and sacrifice. And I know that all 
North Carolinians join me in keeping 
Officer Hayworth’s loving family and 
his many friends and colleagues in our 
prayers. 
May 
God 
bless 
Officer 
Ryan 
Hayworth and all of our Nation’s brave 
law enforcement officers. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

ator from Rhode Island. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleagues in sup-
porting S. 2747, the Freedom to Vote 
Act; and S. 4, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act; and S. 2615, 
the Right to Vote Act. 
As 
some 
States 
and 
political 
operatives around the country seek to 
roll back voter protection laws and 
gerrymander voting districts, Congress 
must act to strengthen the freedom to 
vote and ensure elections are safe and 
accessible. 
Since its original passage in 1965, the 
Voting Rights Act safeguarded the 
rights of historically marginalized vot-
ers at the polls. 
Sadly, the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 
ruling in Shelby County v. Holder gut-
ted key Voting Rights Act protections. 
Earlier this year, in July 2021, the Su-
preme Court issued another split ruling 
further weakening the law in its deci-
sion in Brnovich v. DNC, making it 
more difficult to challenge discrimina-
tory voting laws under section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act. 
Over the years, this democracy has 
seen a crisis in access to the polls, and 
it has been worsened recently as Re-
publican-led State legislatures have 
implemented policies that dispropor-
tionately suppress the voting rights of 
people of color, the elderly, college stu-
dents, and those living in rural areas, 
among others. Those same political 
operatives have repeatedly weaponized 
false claims of election fraud, like 
those perpetuated by former President 
Trump, to try to overturn the will of 
the people. 
The right to vote is a fundamental 
right guaranteed by our Constitution 
and our desired responsibility to pro-
tect it. In the United States of Amer-
ica, a beacon of democracy, our elec-
tions must be open and transparent and 
follow a process and procedure that all 
Americans can trust. It is more impor-
tant than ever for Congress to affirm 
that voters have a right to free and fair 
elections. 
The Freedom to Vote Act fulfills this 
constitutional responsibility by im-
proving access to the ballot, advancing 
commonsense election integrity re-
forms, and protecting our democracy 
from emerging threats from cyber at-
tacks to misinformation bots. It is not 
the job of government to make it hard 
to vote; rather, it is our responsibility 
to balance the convenience of voters 
with the security of their ballots. This 
legislation does just that. 
I also support the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, which will 
repair the damage done by the Su-
preme Court’s decisions by restoring 
the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil 
Rights Division’s oversight over his-
torically discriminatory States when 
they change voting laws and legislative 
districts. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act would provide needed 
Federal oversight and serve as a check 
on communities that have engaged in a 
pattern of restricting voting rights and 
making it harder for minority voters 
to be counted. 
Finally, I support the Right to Vote 
Act, which would establish the first-

ever statutory right to vote in Federal 
elections, therefore allowing Ameri-
cans to enforce that right by chal-
lenging in court any policy that re-
stricts ballot access. 
This legislation takes an enshrined 
right and empowers the people with the 
tools to defend it. This way, States at-
tempting to restrict voting access will 
have to meet a high bar to justify any 
policy that makes it harder for U.S. 
citizens to participate in Federal elec-
tions. 
Restricting the ability of Americans 
to freely and fairly cast their ballots 
threatens the very core of our Nation’s 
founding democratic principles. 
As Americans deal with the ongoing 
effects of COVID–19 and prepare for 
elections in the coming months and 
years, we should be removing—not add-
ing—unnecessary barriers to voting. 
While efforts to pass voting rights 
legislation have been stymied by Sen-
ate Republicans, you can be assured 
that I will continue to stand ready and 
willing to work with my colleagues in 
Congress to defend Americans’ right to 
vote, end partisan gerrymandering, and 
prevent voter suppression. 
The vote today will allow us to begin 
a much-needed debate on the topic of 
voting rights. I ask my Republican col-
leagues to come to the table and join 
us in this conversation about how we 
can protect our elections and safeguard 
American democracy. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
these important bills that would pro-
tect and advance voting rights in our 
country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2842 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, our Armed 
Forces have been asked to work mir-
acles over the last 18 months, and they 
have performed. During a global pan-
demic, in the face of natural disasters, 
facing dangerous missions, our men 
and women in uniform have risen duti-
fully, faithfully to the challenge. Many 
of 
our 
servicemembers 
have 
con-
tracted—and then recovered from— 
COVID–19 over the last 18 months. Now 
these same heroes are being placed in a 
corner by this administration. 
President Biden’s COVID–19 vaccine 
requirement for the Armed Forces does 
not grant our soldiers, sailors, and ma-
rines the respect they deserve, and it 
could pose a challenge to recruitment 
and even to military readiness. 
This mandate, tied with President 
Biden’s more sweeping general vaccine 
mandate, has put millions of Ameri-
cans in difficult positions. In most 
cases, these are just everyday Ameri-
cans. They are mothers and fathers, 
husbands and wives just trying to put 
food on the table during what has, for 
many, been a difficult time. 
These still unwritten but very much 
efficacious mandates are forcing mil-
lions of our fellow citizens into a sort 
of second-class, unemployable status, 
placing countless of our neighbors on 
the economic and social fringes of our 
society. 
I have heard from almost 300 Utahans 
in recent days who were worried about 
losing their jobs due to the mandates. 
Some of these individuals are heroic 
members of our military. These serv-
icemembers were rightly praised for 
serving during a pandemic and for dan-
gerous missions, but now are being 
forced out, possibly with limited or no 
retirement benefits because of the 
President’s mandate. 
Let me just share with you a few of 
their stories. One soldier who reached 
out to me recently has served for 10 
years in the military. He never re-
ceived a single reprimand, whether 
written or verbal. He honorably and 
proudly served his Nation. He has been 
informed, despite his years of success-
ful Active-Duty service, that he will 
not receive an honorable discharge if 
he doesn’t comply with the vaccine re-
quirement. Accordingly, he asked to 
resign from the military. His com-
manders made clear that he would be 
barred 
from 
resignation. 
Then 
he 
sought a personal religious exemption. 
He was summarily told that his exemp-
tion request would be denied. 
Of his situation, he said: 
To be backed into a corner with two very 
bad options is both disheartening and sad, 
especially with what I have sacrificed and 
what my family has sacrificed on behalf of 
the military. 
Another soldier told me his story. He 
has been in the Army for 18 years. All 
along, he was planning on retiring 
upon reaching two decades of service. 
He is about 18 months shy of reaching 
that point—just 18 months from that 
retirement point that he has been 
working toward for nearly two decades. 
Now, because of the vaccine mandate, 
he is at risk of losing his benefits and 
not receiving an honorable discharge. 
Regarding his situation, he said: 
This will cause a substantial loss in pay 
and quality of life for myself and a large 
number of others I know. 
A third soldier reached out to my of-
fice in a similar retirement situation. 
This soldier has children who experi-
enced complications with receiving the 
vaccine. The soldier also has a child 
with significant learning disabilities, 
whom he is worried about providing 
for. 
He said: 
This really could be a life-changing event 
for my family, and I feel strongly enough 
about it that I will risk all my benefits not 
to take [the vaccine]. I just wish I had a 
choice. 
Now, these stories just barely scratch 
the surface of the hundreds of stories 
that I have heard from people across 
my State, including many who are 
servicemembers. These people, like 
millions of other Americans, deserve a 
better option. They have earned that. 
That is why, today, I am asking that 
the Senate pass my Respecting our 
Servicemembers Act. This bill would 
simply prohibit the Secretary of De-
fense from requiring COVID–19 vaccina-
tion for our military. I am grateful to 
my colleagues Senators BRAUN
and 
TUBERVILLE for joining me as cospon-
sors. 
This is now the seventh time I have 
come to the Senate floor, asking that 
the Federal Government take a more 
temperate, reasoned approach. As I 
have said each time before, I am not 
anti-vaccine. In fact, I believe the de-
velopment of the COVID–19 vaccine is a 
miracle. I have been vaccinated, and I 
have encouraged every member of my 
family to be vaccinated, and they have 
done so. I think the vaccine is a good 
thing. These mandates are simply the 
wrong way of getting it done. 
Look, when we look at the employer 
vaccine mandate generally, the Presi-
dent doesn’t have the authority. In 
fact, the Federal Government doesn’t 
have that authority. This is not a 
power that belongs to the Federal Gov-
ernment to begin with. You know, even 
if it did, we haven’t authorized the 
President to do this unilaterally. Even 
if we had or even if we were now con-
sidering a measure that would give him 
that authority, it is worth noting here 
that there are so many other better, 
more reasoned ways to encourage vac-
cination. 
That is why I am here today, and 
that is why I will be back for as long as 
it takes to address these mandates, 
which are causing pain and suffering to 
hard-working moms and dads who 
don’t want to have to be making a gut- 
wrenching choice between, on the one 
hand, receiving medical treatment that 
they don’t want, whether for religious 
reasons or a health-related reason re-
lated to what their doctors have ad-
vised them or some other compelling 
personal 
reason 
or 
otherwise—they 
shouldn’t have to choose between re-
ceiving medical treatment they don’t 
want and forfeiting their ability to put 
bread on the table for their children. It 
is un-American, it is unfair, and it is 
immoral. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Armed Services be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. 2842 and that the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration. I fur-
ther ask unanimous consent that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, in reserv-
ing my right to object, on August 24, 
the Secretary of Defense determined 
that 
the

vaccination 
against COVID–19 was necessary to

protect the force and defend the Amer-
ican people. 
Vaccination is not mandatory for 
any servicemember who has a legiti-
mate medical or religious reason for 
not being vaccinated. 
Mandatory vaccinations are limited 
to only FDA-approved vaccines. All 
FDA-approved COVID–19 vaccines have 
been determined to be safe and effec-
tive. 
According to press reports, as of Oc-
tober 4, Active-Duty vaccination rates 
are as follows: the Army, 81 percent; 
the Navy, 90 percent; the Air Force, 
80.9 percent; and the Marine Corps, 76.5 
percent. 
Mandatory vaccination is not a new 
issue for military personnel. Manda-
tory vaccinations for critical illnesses 
are mission critical, and requiring vac-
cination is almost as old as the mili-
tary itself. I can personally verify that 
point. Indeed, servicemembers are cur-
rently required to get 17 different vac-
cinations when they enter the military 
or before deploying overseas, including 
for measles, mumps, diphtheria, hepa-
titis, smallpox, and the flu. 
We need a healthy and ready force. 
We saw what happened when Navy 
ships were contaminated with COVID. 
They weren’t ready to deploy. They 
couldn’t deploy. They were tied up. 
Their effectiveness and ability to de-
fend the country were marginalized, to 
say the least. I think this is absolutely 
incongruent with the practice and mis-
sion of the military. 
One other thing I would say is that 
one of the most fundamental ethics of 
the military is that every soldier, sail-
or, marine, airman, and guardian is 
prepared to sacrifice for their fellow 
servicemember, and the idea that one 
would put their own personal feelings 
ahead of the potential for contami-
nating or sickening another service-
member and affecting the unit is some-
thing that I don’t think squares with 
the ethic of the U.S. military or the ef-
fectiveness of the force. 
I agree with the Secretary of De-
fense; therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. I would ask the quorum call be 
vitiated. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate is not in a quorum call. 
Mr. BENNET. For once, the Senate is 
not in a quorum call. It is amazing. We 
are having an actual debate. I can’t be-
lieve it. It has been so long since that 
has been true. 
FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am 
here to talk about voting rights today, 
and I actually am delighted that you 
are in the Chair, my colleague from 
Colorado, because over many years you 
have had so much to do with the fact 
that Colorado has the second-highest 
turnout of any State in the country—76 
percent—because of what we have done, 
Republicans and Democrats and unaf-
filiated voters working together, to 
make sure that Coloradans can cast 
their ballots. 
I am tired, as I am sure you are, of 
hearing our colleague from Minnesota 
come down here, Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
and say that Minnesota is No. 1 in vot-
ing, which they are. They have more 
than 76 percent of the people that vote, 
but I think we will catch them, and 
maybe we will catch them this year. 
But the reason why we have such a 
high turnout is because of things that 
we have put in place working in a bi-
partisan way. And when the Presiding 
Officer was the Governor of Colorado, 
you know, that was when, really, we 
moved to the mail-in ballot system 
that we have, completely fraud free 
and a delight, especially for people liv-
ing in rural areas, where it is hard to 
get to the ballot box sometimes. 
And so thank you for helping create 
a model for the country as we debate 
this bill in front of us. In fact, much of 
what this bill does—I will get to the 
bill in a minute—is reflective of the 
work that we have done in Colorado. 
Mr. President, you came here during 
a difficult time, I would say, for our de-
mocracy. This has been, in many ways, 
a near-death experience for the U.S. de-
mocracy. There are countries all over 
the world that are totalitarian soci-
eties who are counting on our country 
to fail. They tell us at the negotiating 
table every time we sit down with 
them that they think we are going to 
fail; that democracy isn’t up to the 
challenges of the 21st century; that it 
doesn’t move fast enough. This place 
doesn’t move at all many weeks and 
could give a person reason to wonder 
whether or not we are going to make it 
work. 
But in this year, we had a particu-
larly savage experience on January 6, 
when the Capitol was invaded by our 
own citizens, and we were escorted off 
the floor of the Senate, taken to a se-
cure facility, where I watched and the 
Presiding Officer watched what every-
body in America saw, what everybody 
in the world saw, which were thousands 
of people streaming into this Capitol to 
try to stop the counting of the vote at 
the urging of then-President Trump. 
And, fortunately, because there were 
enough people in this body who wanted 
to confirm the vote, on January 20, we 
actually had a peaceful transfer of 
power, and Joe Biden became the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Most countries that have a January 6 
never survive to January 20, you know. 
And when I was a kid, it was common 
to see these kinds of things happen in 
other capitals around the world, places 
like Tehran. You never would have 
imagined it would happen here in 
Washington, DC. 
And now it has happened here in 
Washington, DC. But the big difference 
is that because more people turned out 
to vote than at any time in our coun-
try’s history, we had that peaceful 
transfer of power. 
And now the question for all of us, I 
think, as Americans, is, What are we 
going do with the gift that our fellow 
citizens have given us by turning out 
to vote in the midst of a pandemic in 
record number? What are we going to 
do with that gift they have given to 
us—a gift of democracy, I would say, a 
new lease on life. 
And I think we have got a moral obli-
gation to them and to our Nation’s 
children and, frankly, to humanity to 
make sure that this democracy actu-
ally works for the American people and 
not for the special interests that have 
worked so hard to corrupt it. 
And there are so many ways before 
January 6 that our democracy was 
being 
attacked: 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering all over the country to 
allow politicians to pick their voters 
rather than have voters pick their poli-
ticians. That is an incredibly undemo-
cratic thing for us to be doing across 
the country; the special interests that 
lobby this place who are basically un-
regulated by any campaign finance 
laws; the effect of Citizens United, 
which was the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion that opened the floodgates of bil-
lionaires funding American elections 
instead of people funding American 
elections; and now, perhaps most egre-
giously, because it is so strategic and 
it is so purposeful, the attack on the 
vote all over the United States of 
America. 
I find it hard to believe. I am 54 
years—56. That is the saddest story I 
have ever told. I am 56 years old, Mr. 
President. As you know, I went to col-
lege in the 1980s, you know, and now I 
am seeing laws passed that I read 
about in the 1980s that passed in the 
1960s to try to deny people the right to 
vote all over the country, to make it 
harder to vote. 
Just this year, 19 States have passed 
33 laws undermining democracy; laws 
to make it harder to vote early or vote 
by mail, two things we treasure in the 
State of Colorado; laws to slash the 
number of drop boxes or put them in 
really inconvenient places so people 
can’t vote, as I do every single election 
with a drop box just a few blocks from 
my house. It takes me 30 seconds to 
vote, completely fraud free. Everyone 
in America should have the benefit of 
that. 
We have got a law that made it a 
crime in Georgia to give people water 
while they are waiting in line to vote. 
So I know there is a tendency around 
this place sometimes to just think that 
our democracy, just because it has al-
ways been here, that it is always going 
to be around, to assume that we can 
coast on the blood and the sweat and 
the tears of Americans who came be-
fore us, who fought generation after 
generation after generation to make 
this country more democratic, more 
fair, and more free. This is not a time 
for coasting. This is a time for us to 
deal with the profound threat that is 
stealing the right of Americans all over 
this country to vote, to have their

voice heard, to be able to have a say in 
the direction of our democracy or 
whether we are going to have a democ-
racy at all, whether we are going to ac-
cept the world where politicians, like 
the people in this body but at the State 
legislatures, can overturn the inde-
pendent judgment of other parts of the 
election apparatus, people that held 
the line this year when somebody in 
the White House was trying to intimi-
date them to change their mind. 
We have got people in this country, 
State legislators, who are passing laws 
that would allow them to do exactly 
what Donald Trump said he wanted 
them to do, which was overturn the 
election judgments of independently 
elected or appointed officials. That is 
something we cannot allow to have 
happen because the minute that does 
happen, you lose the democracy. The 
minute you cannot make a decision at 
the voting booth, at the voting box, at 
the poll, the minute you can no longer 
make a decision there that is held up 
no matter who wins and no matter who 
loses, that has the confidence of the 
American people, that is when you lose 
the democracy because the whole point 
of a democracy, the way we make deci-
sions, is a peaceful transfer of power. 
And in the absence of that very, very 
unusual aspect of our society compared 
to other societies around the world and 
the history of humanity, in the absence 
of that, what you confront is political 
violence like the violence that we saw 
on January 6, where people tried to 
take by force something that should 
have been decided and was decided at 
the ballot box. 
And all of this, in my view, is why it 
is so important for us to pass the Free-
dom to Vote Act. The bill includes 
commonsense reforms that are broadly 
supported by the American people, and 
that is because they reflect common 
sense, just like the American people. 
And we know these reforms work, 
Mr. President, because we have already 
passed them in Colorado, thanks in 
large part to your leadership. We 
banned partisan gerrymandering. We 
don’t have it in our State. 
So, again, politicians in Colorado 
don’t have the right to choose who 
their voters are; voters get to choose 
who their elected leaders are. 
We have automatic voter registra-
tion, as this bill has; early voting, so 
people have a chance to get off work 
and go to vote and don’t have to just be 
there on election day. 
Vote by mail, which I have to say, up 
until the last President’s Presidency, 
there was no one in America that was 
concerned about vote by mail. We had 
cast millions of ballots in this country 
without a shred of fraud. Just ask the 
American Enterprise Institute. They 
are the ones that said you are more 
likely to get struck by lightning than 
participate in voter fraud by voting by 
mail. That is not a Democratic-leaning 
organization, as everybody on this 
floor knows. 
Secure drop boxes in your neighbor-
hood, where it takes 30 seconds to 
vote—every time I go there, next to the 
Botanic Gardens in my neighborhood 
in Denver, and I drop my ballot off, I 
think about all the people all over this 
country in 2021 who don’t have the sim-
ple ability to drop their ballot off in a 
ballot box, who are having to wait in 
line for hours for the privilege to vote 
just because of the State they live in. 
We should have basic national stand-
ards for people. It is a civil rights 
issue. It is an issue that is fundamental 
to our democracy. And having a con-
venient ballot box is one of those 
things. Having mail-in ballots is one of 
those things. We have had zero fraud in 
our system. 
And as I said earlier, in many ways, 
it is as important to rural Colorado as 
any other part of our State because the 
people live a long way from the ballot 
box. 
If our State’s history is any guide at 
all, we can do this in a bipartisan way. 
And it is not surprising to me that vast 
majorities of Americans, whether they 
are Republicans or Independents or 
Democrats, support the provisions that 
are in this bill by wide, wide margins. 
I am going to be pleased to go back 
to Colorado and have the chance to tell 
them that we have banned dark money 
from our political system; that the Su-
preme Court’s fundamental misunder-
standing in Citizens United, where they 
completely misdefined the problem and 
failed to see the corruption of inaction 
that happens around here, the things 
that aren’t done because of the dark 
money that is spent in our elections 
because—for fear that some billionaire 
is going to show up and throw what to 
them is nothing into a race that could 
determine the outcome of our elec-
tions. 
We have got to change that, and the 
only way we can do that is by passing 
this bill. And I think that if we pass 
this bill, what we find is that States all 
over this country would see 76 percent 
of the people voting, just like in Colo-
rado, instead of 50 percent of the people 
voting or 40 percent of the people vot-
ing. That would have a huge impact on 
what we are doing. We could show the 
world that we can actually compete 
with the communist government in 
China. We can resolve the question 
about whether democracy is up to this 
in the 21st century or not. 
We could invest in the next genera-
tion of Americans. We could improve 
our schools, improve our roads and 
bridges, and invest in the future again, 
as so many generations of Americans 
have done in the past when they stood 
up for democracy and the next genera-
tion of Americans. That is the question 
that we are confronted with today as 
we take this vote. 
Are we going to stand up for our de-
mocracy? Are we going to stand up for 
humanity, who is relying on us to de-
liver a democracy that works? And are 
we going to stand up for the next gen-
eration of Americans and remain a bea-
con to the rest of the world, committed 
to our highest ideals and not our worst 
instincts? 
I think we have the chance today 
when we take this vote to follow gen-
erations of Americans who have, in 
their lives, lived out those best ideals, 
rather than caving into our worst in-
stincts. 
It seems to me—putting Democrats 
and Republicans aside—the question in 
front of us is: Are you for democracy or 
not? Are you for the freedom to vote or 
not? Are you for maximizing fraud-free 
elections, where people can actually 
turn out to vote no matter where they 
live? Or are you suppressing the vote of 
our fellow countrymen and women? 
That is the question before us. And 
because it is such a clear question, I 
would urge every one of my colleagues, 
Republican or Democrat, to vote for 
this legislation so we can set a basic 
standard for what the freedom of vote 
should look like in the United States of 
America. 
With that, Mr. President, I appre-
ciate your indulgence and patience. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness—our 
Nation was founded upon this set of in-
alienable rights that are provided to 
each one of us not by government, but 
by our Divine Creator who made us all 
equal. It is the role of the government 
to secure these blessings. 
Regardless of our differences and dis-
agreements, these principles outlined 
in our founding documents have always 
united us and made America excep-
tional. They are the framework of the 
American dream, the promise that 
through self-determination, hard work, 
and opportunity, we can all achieve a 
better life for ourselves and for our 
families. 
Yet, whether you are pursuing a ca-
reer, attending school, starting a busi-
ness, or shopping for a dream home, DC 
politicians and government bureau-
crats are increasingly dictating when 
you may exercise your rights and how 
you can live your life, and then spying 
on you to make sure that you are fol-
lowing the rules. This ‘‘Washington 
knows best’’ approach is negatively im-
pacting nearly every aspect of your 
life, and you may not realize it. 
To demonstrate the point, let’s walk 
through a few common scenarios and 
the real-life consequences you could 
face as a result of the Biden adminis-
tration’s policies. For each, ask your-
self: In this situation, is the govern-
ment acting to secure or subvert your 
rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness? 
You work hard and probably put 
some of your earnings away in a sav-
ings account to pay your monthly bills

October 20, 2021 
or to be prepared for an unexpected 
emergency. And, folks, that is just a 
smart thing to do. 
Well, if you deposit or withdraw more 
than $10,000 over the course of a year, 
the Biden administration wants the 
IRS to be able to spy on you. To put 
this number into perspective, if you 
were renting an apartment in Iowa, the 
average annual cost to do so is just 
over $10,000 per year. That is the 
threshold, folks. 
Why does Washington even need to 
know this information about you? 
The Treasury Department says this 
is necessary to make sure ‘‘the top one 
percent . . . can’t evade’’ paying taxes. 
You heard that right. The Biden ad-
ministration thinks you are rich if, 
over the course of an entire year, you 
either save or spend $10,000. They 
might even have the IRS audit you for 
tax evasion. 
Treating 
American 
citizens 
like 
criminal suspects for the innocent act 
of using a bank account is, quite frank-
ly, un-American. 
The Biden administration has been 
up front about its motive here. Wash-
ington Democrats are looking to col-
lect as many tax dollars as possible to 
finance their never-ending reckless 
spending spree. And as a direct result 
of these budget busting bills, govern-
ment inflation is driving up prices and 
limiting availability of everyday essen-
tials. 
Let’s take a look at life in Joe 
Biden’s America. The cost of food, the 
cost of rent, the cost of nearly every-
thing just keeps going up and up. 
Meanwhile, the size of many products 
is shrinking, which means you have to 
work harder, pay more, and get a heck 
of a lot less. It is even costing more 
just to get to the grocery store. Gas is 
now more than $3 a gallon, the highest 
price in 6 years. And this really 
shouldn’t come as a surprise. 
Remember, on his first day on the 
job, President Biden signed an Execu-
tive order to end the Keystone XL 
Pipeline, killing thousands of jobs and 
limiting our access to oil and gas sup-
plies. And while costs keep going up, 
just finding what you need or want has 
become yet another ordeal. 
As a result of Biden bucks, which 
paid people not to work for most of the 
year, many products are in short sup-
ply or unavailable altogether. Shipping 
companies are even facing equipment 
shortages and, of course, they remain 
understaffed. 
And, folks, this crisis isn’t ending 
anytime soon. The upcoming holiday 
season is already being referred to as 
‘‘Biden’s Blue Christmas.’’ The White 
House is even warning there will be 
items people can’t get for Christmas. 
So let’s just hope for the sake of the 
kids who have been good all year that 
Biden’s broken supply chain problems 
don’t extend all the way to the North 
Pole. 
And speaking of kids, let’s take a 
look at what might happen to parents 
who take a vocal role in their chil-
dren’s education. It is a good thing for 
parents to be active in their children’s 
education, and it comes as no surprise 
that they can often get very passionate 
about the subject. 
So imagine going to a school board 
meeting and exercising your right to 
express your concerns about a new pol-
icy or proposed curriculum at your 
child’s school, but instead of having 
your issue addressed, you find yourself 
labeled as a domestic terrorist. 
Yeah, folks, you heard that right—a 
domestic terrorist under investigation 
by our Nation’s chief law enforcement 
agency. 
It sounds insane, right? 
But it is a crazy reality today. Presi-
dent Biden’s Attorney General is mobi-
lizing the FBI against parents who 
make their voices heard at school 
board meetings. 
Let me be very clear about this. Vio-
lence or even threats of violence 
against school board members, teach-
ers, or any public official should never 
ever be tolerated; but neither should 
threats of intimidation by the govern-
ment to coerce parents to surrender 
control over their children’s education. 
This is happening at the same time 
the FBI announced the largest spike in 
homicides ever recorded. I am not talk-
ing about this year, folks. I am not 
talking about last year, 4, 5, 6 years 
past. We are talking about the largest 
spike in homicides ever recorded. 
With murder and violent crimes in-
creasing, the President’s liberal allies 
in Congress are threatening to defund 
the police. That approach certainly is 
not going to secure life, liberty, or the 
pursuit of happiness. 
Folks, all of these disturbing trends 
we just talked about are stark remind-
ers that the principles our Nation was 
founded 
upon 
are 
not 
guaranteed. 
Every generation of Americans owes it 
to the next generation to preserve and 
strengthen the blessings of liberty we 
were fortunate enough to inherit. 
I’d 
expect 
government 
coercion, 
State snooping, empty shelves, and 
out-of-control inflation in nations with 
socialist regimes, like China, Cuba, and 
Venezuela. But regardless of who our 
President may be, we must never ever 
accept any of these as part of life in 
America. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 
minutes on the matter at hand. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to speak in support of 
what is right before us right now, and 
that is, proceeding to debate legisla-
tion that is critical to our democracy, 
the Freedom to Vote Act, which I in-
troduced with the members of the vot-
ing rights working group assembled by 
Leader SCHUMER. That would be Sen-
ators MANCHIN, MERKLEY, PADILLA, 
KING, KAINE, TESTER, and WARNOCK. We 
all have our names on this bill. We all 
feel very strongly about this bill. Why? 
Because the freedom to vote is funda-
mental to all of our freedoms, and it is 
currently under attack. 
Since the 2020 elections, we have seen 
a persistent and coordinated assault on 
the freedom to vote, but it has been 
under attack for much longer, as 
States have closed polling locations on 
a massive scale and purged hundreds of 
thousands of voters from the rolls. 
As foreign adversaries have actually 
attempted to interfere in our elections, 
these attacks on our democracy de-
mand a Federal response. When you 
have one State attacked by a foreign 
adversary, when they try to get into 
voter rolls in Illinois or Hawaii, are we 
going to expect those States to respond 
on their own? When you have an as-
sault, a coordinated assault, on voting 
rights, so you have similar bills intro-
duced across the country to limit drop- 
off boxes; when you have coordinated 
attacks to limit vote-by-mail; when 
you have coordinated attacks to limit 
registration to vote, it demands a Fed-
eral response. 
What is amazing about our Constitu-
tion is that the Founding Fathers an-
ticipated this because right in the Con-
stitution, it says that Congress—this 
place where we work—can make and 
alter the laws regarding Federal elec-
tions. It is bulletproof. It has been 
upheld time and time again. 
The urgent need for action could not 
be more serious. With over 400 bills 
having been introduced in nearly every 
State to limit the freedom to vote— 
over 30 of those have been signed into 
law—with redistricting underway to 
draw congressional maps that will de-
fine our democracy for the next dec-
ade—and the first primary for the 2022 
elections is in a little over 4 months in 
Texas—we must act now. 
It has been over 9 months since that 
violent 
mob 
of 
insurrectionists 
stormed into this Chamber, opened up 
people’s desks, and sat where the Pre-
siding Officer is sitting right now. 
They desecrated our Capitol, the tem-
ple of our democracy. This was not just 
an attack on a building. It was an at-
tack on our Republic. It was an attack 
on public servants, police officers who 
were serving us that day. 
As I said from the inaugural stage 
just 2 weeks later under that beautiful 
blue sky at the very place where you 
could still see the spray paint on the 
columns, where we stood in front of 
makeshift windows—where we stood 
together, leaders of both political par-
ties in both Chambers and from across 
the Nation—I said: This is the day our 
democracy picks itself up, brushes 
itself off, and does what America al-
ways does—goes forward as one Nation 
under God, indivisible, with liberty and 
justice for all. 
We took back our democracy that 
day. With this Freedom to Vote Act, 
which includes provisions that have 
the support of 78 percent of Americans

October 20, 2021 
who favor 2 weeks of early voting and 
83 percent of voters who support public 
disclosure of campaign contributions 
because they believe the people should 
be running the government, not lobby-
ists and not outside groups, we will 
take it back again from those who are 
trying to take away the people’s con-
stitutional right to vote. 
With 19 States having enacted laws 
this year to roll back the freedom to 
vote, we can’t simply sit back and 
watch our democracy be threatened. 
Whether it be threatened with bear 
spray, crowbars, axes, or whether it be 
threatened with long lines, no ballot 
drop-off boxes, and secret money, we 
must stand up for our democracy 
whether we are Democrats or Repub-
licans or Independents. That is what 
our country is about. 
When we are faced with a coordinated 
effort across our country to limit the 
freedom to vote, we must stand up and 
do what is right. But, as we have seen 
in States like Georgia and Florida and 
Iowa and Montana and last month in 
Texas, we are up against a coordinated 
attack. As Senator Reverend RAPHAEL 
WARNOCK has said, it is really quite 
simple: Some people don’t want some 
people to vote. That is what this is 
about. 
What is this Freedom to Vote Act 
about? It is about minimum standards 
for voting. You know, it is 15 days of 
early voting. My State votes up to 40 
days. That is not what we put in this 
bill. We put minimum standards in this 
bill, ensuring voters have access to at 
least 2 weeks of early voting so they 
can cast their mail-in ballot without 
an excuse—something people were able 
to use as a way to safely vote in the 
middle of a public health crisis. They 
did it in record numbers in the middle 
of a crisis because they believed in our 
democracy no matter which way they 
voted. Why would we take away that 
right from them now when we are see-
ing a curtailing of that right in many 
States across this country? 
It counters partisan interference in 
election administrations, makes sure 
that these super PACs and issue advo-
cacy groups that hide behind veils have 
to show who is giving them the money, 
and prohibits partisan gerrymandering. 
Then we listened to secretaries of 
state across this country, Democrats 
and Republicans. We listened to our 
colleague Senator MANCHIN, who proud-
ly has his name on this bill. So what 
did we do? We made changes to this 
bill. It provides flexibility for small 
and vote-by-mail jurisdictions on early 
voting. It makes it easier to implement 
automatic voter registration. It cre-
ates a new flexible source of Federal 
funding to help our States. It ensures 
election officials can use best practices 
for maintaining accurate and up-to- 
date voter rolls. 
It is important to recognize that the 
Freedom to Vote Act is the first piece 
of voting rights legislation this Con-
gress to come to the Senate floor with 
the support of all 50 Senate Democrats. 
Now, our Republican colleagues may 
not agree with everything in this bill. 
OK. Then don’t be scared. Don’t hide 
behind your desks. Don’t deny us the 
right to simply debate this bill. Our 
leader, Senator SCHUMER, has made it 
very clear: We are open to amendments 
on this bill. We welcome your amend-
ments. We are not putting a limit on 
amendments. 
So why would you shy away from de-
bating this bill—unless you just don’t 
want the American people to hear the 
truth; unless you don’t want the sto-
ries told about what is going on in 
places like Georgia, where voters are 
now being asked to put their birth date 
on the outside of the inside envelope. 
Maybe you don’t want to have the sto-
ries told about how voters in Wisconsin 
almost—except for the Governor stop-
ping it in its tracks, voters in Wis-
consin almost were limited in the en-
tire city of Milwaukee to one drop-off 
box. That bill passed their legislature. 
That is what we are talking about 
here. 
So let’s have this debate. Let’s hear 
the argument. Let’s not stop the de-
bate over the fundamental right to 
vote that our entire democracy is 
founded on. 
If our Republican colleagues have 
constructive ideas on ways to improve 
this legislation and if they are willing 
to work with us on amendments, then 
we are prepared to hear them. We are 
simply asking them to open up the de-
bate. Instead, it will be more people 
standing in line, like they did in Wis-
consin in the primary, in homemade 
masks and garbage bags in a rainstorm 
just to exercise their right to vote. It is 
going to be people who are told, like 
they just were in Georgia: You can’t 
even vote on weekends in the runoff pe-
riod. It is going to be people who served 
in our military who have to wait in 
line in the hot Sun, wait for hours to 
vote. That didn’t happen when they 
signed up to serve our country, but it 
happens when they try to vote. 
Let’s have that debate. Americans 
have fought and died to protect our 
freedom to vote. They have done so on 
the battlefield, and they did so in 
marches during the civil rights move-
ment. Fifty-six years after the Voting 
Rights Act was passed by this Chamber 
and signed into law, we cannot shut 
down the debate. 
Our Nation was founded on the ideals 
of democracy, and we have seen for 
ourselves in this very building that we 
can’t afford to take that for granted. 
We can’t do it when legislators and 
Members of Congress get to pick and 
choose who is going to be able to vote 
easily. We do it by debating real ideas 
and standing on the shoulders of those 
who went out to vote. That is what a 
democracy is about. 
I urge my colleagues to open up the 
debate, to not be afraid and shut down 
the debate, to not hide under their 
desks, to not put their heads down. I 
urge them to simply open up the de-
bate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SCHUMER. I change my vote to 
no. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, 
the yeas are 49, the nays are 51. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the 
affirmative, the motion is not agreed 
to. 
The motion was rejected. 
MOTION TO RECONSIDER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
enter a motion to reconsider the failed 
cloture vote. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion 
is entered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, I want to be clear about what just 
happened on the floor of the Senate. 
Every single Republican Senator just 
blocked this Chamber from having a 
debate—simply a debate—on protecting 
Americans’ right to vote in free and 
fair elections. 
A little over a year ago, our country 
held the safest, most accessible, most 
on-the-level elections in modern his-
tory. Our former President could not 
accept defeat with grace. He refused to 
show fidelity to the democratic proc-
ess. 
Instead, he told a Big Lie—a Big Lie 
that has now poisoned—poisoned—the 
roots of our democracy. Capitalizing on 
this malicious lie, his acolytes in con-
servative-controlled 
legislatures 
are 
now passing laws across the country 
making it harder for younger, poorer, 
urban, and non-White Americans to 
participate in our elections. 
These laws are a direct attack on our 
fundamental liberties as American citi-
zens. If there is anything—anything— 
worthy of the Senate’s attention, it is 
unquestionably this. 
And yet, given the chance to respond 
to an obvious problem, given the 
chance to merely debate these latest 
threats against the franchise, Senate 
Republicans 
voted 
unanimously— 
unanimously—to 
block 
any 
oppor-
tunity for action. 
Let there be no mistake, Senate Re-
publicans blocking debate today is an 
implicit endorsement of the horrid new 
voter suppression and election subver-
sion laws pushed in conservative States 
across the country. By preventing the 
Senate from functioning as it was in-
tended, Republicans in this body are 
permitting States to criminalize giving 
food and water to voters at the polls. 
Republicans are saying it’s OK to limit 
polling places and voting hours and 
shut the doors to more expansive vote 
by mail. 
I mean, my God. Why aren’t all of my 
colleagues outraged by these laws? 
Frankly, we haven’t heard a clear ex-
planation from Republicans at all be-
cause they refused for this Chamber to 
even hold a debate. It is ludicrous—lu-
dicrous—for them to simply state that 
the Federal Government has no role to 
play here. They should read the Con-
stitution of these United States of 
America. It precisely empowers Con-
gress to regulate the ‘‘times, places, 
and manners’’ of holding elections. The 
Congress—us. Sometimes the Federal 
Government has been the only recourse 
when States conspire to shut voters 
out. 
Madam President, the fight to pro-
tect our democracy is far from over in 
the 
United 
States 
Senate. 
Senate 
Democrats have made clear that voting 
rights is not like other issues we deal 
with in this Chamber. This isn’t about 
regular old politics. It is not just about 
even regular old policy. It is about pro-
tecting the very soul of this Nation, 
about preserving our identity as a free 
people who are masters of our own des-
tiny. 
Republican obstruction is not a cause 
for throwing in the towel. As soon as 
next week, I am prepared to bring the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act here to the floor. 
What we saw from Republicans today 
is not how the Senate is supposed to 
work. This is supposedly the world’s 
greatest deliberative body, where we 
debate, forge compromise, amend, and 
pass legislation to help the American 
people. That is the legacy of this great 
Chamber. The Senate needs to be re-
stored to its rightful status as the 
world’s greatest deliberative body. 
Now, in the aftermath of the Civil 
War, and as the Nation began the co-
lossal work of Reconstruction, America 
was more divided than at any point in 
history. It was hard to imagine that a 
single nation could endure after the 
bloody conflict of the four previous 
years. 
At the time, the Republican Congress 
set to work on granting newly freed 
slaves the basic freedoms that had long 
been denied to them. These freedoms 
were eventually enshrined in the 14th 
and 15th Amendments, granting due 
process and the right to vote to all citi-
zens, regardless of color or race. 
Today, these amendments rank as 
some of the greatest and most revered 
accomplishments in congressional his-
tory. They are proof that our country 
is capable of living up to its founding 
promise, if we are willing to put in the 
work. 
But at the time, the minority party 
in both Chambers refused to offer a sin-
gle vote for any of the civil rights leg-
islation put forward during Recon-
struction. Not one vote. Not one vote. 
They argued these bills represented 
nothing more than the partisan inter-
ests of the majority—a power grab, 
they said, from vengeful northerners. 
But that didn’t stop the majority. If 
expanding basic freedoms meant going 
it alone, that was something they were 
willing to do. Today, we feel the same 
way. 
To the patriots after the Civil War, 
this wasn’t partisan; it was patriotic. 
And American democracy is better off 
today because the patriots in this 
Chamber at that time were undeterred 
by minority obstruction. Again, today, 
we feel the same way. 
Today, the question before the Sen-
ate is how we will find a path forward 
on protecting our freedoms in the 21st 
century. 
Members of this body now face a 
choice. They can follow in the foot-
steps of our patriotic predecessors in 
this Chamber, or they can sit by as the 
fabric of our democracy unravels be-
fore our very eyes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7109 
October 20, 2021 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
do have to make a quick comment be-
fore I jump into a unanimous consent 
request. 
I did appreciate hearing the majority 
leader talk about how the minority and 
the majority stood up around Recon-
struction. And I found it interesting 
that he continued to talk about the 
majority and the minority standing up 
for the rights of slaves and the rights 
of individuals, conveniently leaving 
out it was the Republicans at that time 
that were the majority that were actu-
ally standing up for the rights of all in-
dividuals of all races to be able to vote 
and to be able to be engaged, and it was 
the Democrats at that time that were 
working very hard to be able to block 
the rights of individuals to be able to 
vote. 
So I did have to find it personally hu-
morous when he seems to not be very 
shy about saying Republican and Dem-
ocrat on this floor, at that moment he 
used majority and minority. But I di-
gress. On to other issues. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2879 
Madam President, the reason I came 
to the floor today is because, on Sep-
tember 9, the President of the United 
States took to the microphone and told 
the American people his patience was 
wearing thin—was the comment he 
made to the American people: My pa-
tience is wearing thin; therefore, I am 
going to start mandating that individ-
uals across the country have to receive 
a vaccine. 
To which he then put out an Execu-
tive order across to Federal workers, in 
particular, and told Federal workers 
they would have to have a vaccine by 
the end of this year, to be fully vac-
cinated, complete. 
The deadlines he put in place for the 
Moderna vaccine, they would have had 
to have had the first shot by last week; 
by the Pfizer vaccine, they would have 
already have had to have the shot by 
this week; and then the J&J vaccine, 
they would have to have it by a couple 
weeks to be fully complete. 
And he laid down this statement to 
say everybody needs to get vaccinated, 
and then walked away. 
Office of Personnel Management and 
Office of Management and Budget 
didn’t try to start engaging to start 
catching up on this because there was 
no rule that was in place. It was an Ex-
ecutive action. 
I quickly started getting phone calls 
from individuals in my State who were 
exceptionally concerned about that. 
There are Federal workers who have 
worked for the Federal Government for 
decades, who had questions about reli-
gious accommodation or for medical 
exceptions, or, quite frankly, they had 
already had COVID and recovered from 
it and they were concerned about the 
vaccine coming in that they would 
have some kind of relapse at some 
point. 
It is exceptionally rare, but if it is 
them and they walk back through it, it 
is their prerogative. 
So I started asking questions imme-
diately. I went to the CDC to ask if 
they had studied the 44 million Ameri-
cans who have already had COVID and 
recovered, would their recommenda-
tion be those individuals don’t have to 
have the vaccine if they can show they 
already have the antibodies in the 
their system. 
And the answer I got back from CDC 
is: We have not studied it yet. 
A year and a half in, and we have not 
studied it yet. 
I went to the Office of Management 
and Budget to be able to visit with 
them. I heard one set of issues from 
them. Twenty-four hours later, I met 
with the Office of Personnel Manage-
ment, and I heard a different set of 
issues that came from them. They were 
literally in conflict with each other 24 
hours apart. They put out guidance. 
They put out a second set of guidance. 
Each set of guidance they put out be-
comes more chaotic in the process. 
People who have worked remotely 
throughout this entire time of COVID 
and still continue to work remotely are 
a little confused as to why they are 
now being suddenly mandated to have 
a vaccine. 
Individuals who have already had 
COVID, as I mentioned before, and 
have recovered are a little confused 
why they are being mandated to do 
this. 
Individuals 
with 
medical 
accom-
modations who have asked for those, 
who literally are showing up with pa-
perwork from their physician saying 
‘‘This person is currently under cancer 
treatment, and they do not need to 
have the vaccine at this point during 
their moment of treatment,’’ are being 
told by some people ‘‘No, that doesn’t 
count. The CDC has said it is OK. Your 
doctor’s note doesn’t count,’’ and by 
others, they are being told ‘‘No, that 
does count; you can delay it.’’ 
There is one set of rules from one 
Agency and one set of rules from an-
other. In fact, even within the same 
Agency, from department to depart-
ment, there is a different set of rules. 
Some Agencies have said that the vol-
unteer advisory boards are also in-
cluded. Other Agencies are saying: No, 
volunteer advisory boards are not in-
cluded in this mandate. 
Some are receiving word in State 
agencies in my State that because your 
agency takes Federal funds, everyone 
in your State agency also has to be 
vaccinated or we will cut off the Fed-
eral funds to your State. Some agen-
cies are not calling with that same re-
quest. 
The contractors who work with the 
Federal Government were told they 
were also included in this Executive 
order mandate and that everyone in 
their company needs to also be vac-
cinated, except the contractors are 
asking very simple questions: Is it ev-
eryone in our company or is it every-
one who actually works on the con-
tract for the Federal Government? 
They can’t get a straight answer on 
that. 
As simple as it is, even for those con-
tractors who have asked—they have 
said: No, wait a minute, we have a con-
tract already. Are you as the President 
trying to write in an additional stipu-
lation into our contract that we didn’t 
agree to based on an Executive action? 
You don’t have legal authority to be 
able to do that. Is this about the cur-
rent contract or is this about future 
contracting? 
They have not been able to get an an-
swer on that. 
Quite frankly, we as a body—I am 
still fighting to make sure contractors 
don’t have human trafficking in their 
contracting and get suspension for 
this, but apparently, with this Execu-
tive order, companies can still have 
human trafficking and not be sus-
pended, but if they are not 100 percent 
vaccinated, they will be. 
This is a bizarre world we are living 
in currently right now. This mandate 
came out for Federal workers, Federal 
contractors, maybe volunteer advisory 
boards, maybe State agencies, 6 weeks 
ago, and everyone is still asking ques-
tions—what in the world? In the mean-
time, real families in real-life situa-
tions 
are 
dealing 
with 
the 
con-
sequences of the debris field behind 
this. 
One of the Social Security agencies 
in my State, the folks who take care of 
those folks at the Social Security of-
fice—get their cards to them, get ques-
tions from them about Social Secu-
rity—there are eight employees in that 
little agency, that little spot. Four of 
the folks are talking about leaving be-
cause they are concerned about the 
vaccine mandate, and they are not get-
ting their questions answered. If that 
happens, the folks in that part of my 
State will not be able to get access to 
Social Security cards and will not be 
able to get their answers. 
So what is happening? People are 
struggling with a long-term career, de-
ciding whether they are going to leave, 
literally if they are going to follow 
their doctor’s orders or if they are 
going to follow somebody from the CDC 
they have never met before and their 
orders that are coming down. 
Federal contractors are trying to fig-
ure out how they can complete a con-
tract because the President of the 
United States inserted a new element 
into their contract. 
Oh, by the way, many Federal union 
workers are contacting my office, say-
ing: What in the world? This was not 
part of our collective bargaining agree-
ment. Literally, the President is add-
ing a new element to our collective 
bargaining agreement after the fact 
and saying: I know you are a union 
member, but your local unions are not 
going to represent you. 
And they haven’t. They are going to 
their stewards and they are going to 
others and saying ‘‘Hey, I need some-
body to represent me here in this,’’ and 
they are telling them, ‘‘No. The Presi-
dent just inserted something into our 
collective bargaining agreement, and

October 20, 2021 
you can do nothing about it.’’ Federal 
union employees are ticked because 
they thought their union represented 
them, not the President of the United 
States. 
Now, to be clear, I took the vaccine 
as soon as it was eligible for me. My 
wife did the same. My daughters did 
the same. I am incredibly grateful for 
the vaccine. I encourage people all over 
my State, and have from the begin-
ning, to take the vaccine. It has gone 
through a rigorous, scientific process. 
But people in my State, like the 49 
other States in this great country, all 
know this fact to be true: There are 
side effects for some people in the vac-
cine. It is a small group, but no one 
knows if they are in that group until 
they take the vaccine. There are also 
dramatic effects for people who get 
COVID. 
Some 
people 
are 
asymp-
tomatic—literally 
get 
it, 
recover, 
never even knew they had it—and some 
people die from it in a horrible death in 
a hospital. You never know until you 
get it. 
That is why each individual Amer-
ican has to be able to evaluate their 
risk of whether they are going to risk 
it to get COVID or risk it to get the 
vaccine. I think the risk is much lower 
in getting the vaccine. Science has 
proved that number to be accurate. 
But, you know what, I don’t get to de-
cide for them. They have to decide for 
them. I can bring information to them 
and let them make the decision. But, 
instead, the President of the United 
States has stood up and said: My pa-
tience is wearing thin. You have to do 
what I say regardless if you are under 
cancer treatments and regardless if 
you are under any other process. 
I even asked the Office of Personnel 
Management: What are you going to do 
for religious accommodations? 
The answer came back: We cannot 
decide someone’s sincerity. 
The next day, I talked to the Office 
of Personnel Management, which is ac-
tually putting the details together, and 
they gave me a seven-point decision-
making process to help people decide if 
someone’s religious beliefs are sincere 
or not. 
This is a mess, and there are lots of 
people who are caught up in this who 
just want their government to help 
them, not fire them for making a deci-
sion that affects their personal life and 
their family. That is why I have been 
after this for 6 weeks since the famous 
‘‘I am losing patience’’ speech. For 6 
weeks, I have talked about this. For 6 
weeks, I have made phone calls to 
every entity I could make phone calls, 
written letters, brought legislation. 
For 6 weeks, I have brought these 
issues up and said this is a real prob-
lem that is out there. For 6 weeks, I 
am not being heard on this. 
There are Americans in my great 
State who are now having to decide if 
they are going to leave a career they 
love serving their neighbors or if they 
are going to be compelled to take a 
vaccine risk just because the President 
has said: My patience is wearing thin. 
Just to reinforce a simple statement 
about people making decisions on 
risks—it is interesting to me. On the 
first of October, another Executive 
order came out that said: If individuals 
take the vaccine and they are a Fed-
eral worker, because of this new man-
date, if they do have severe side effects 
from it, we will cover them medically. 
That was a little reminder to some 
people who were hesitating of why they 
hesitated. 
Listen, why don’t we go back to 
doing what we do as Americans: Re-
spect each other, encourage people to 
do the right thing, and incentivize. But 
this chaotic mandate where you don’t 
know if you are a Federal contractor; 
you don’t know the rules if you are a 
Federal employee; you don’t know the 
rules if you are on the advisory board; 
you don’t know the rules even if you 
are in a State agency—by the way, the 
deadlines for Moderna and Pfizer have 
already passed, and you still don’t 
know the rules. They are nearing a mo-
ment of being fired and no one even has 
the details yet? Please. 
Why don’t you listen to the people in 
your own State asking very straight-
forward questions? This is not about 
whether you should take the vaccine. 
This is, are you going to fire a 25-year 
Federal employee because they dis-
agree with you? That is what this is all 
about. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Homeland Security 
and 
Governmental 
Affairs 
be 
dis-
charged from further consideration of 
my bill that sets aside this Executive 
order from the President, S. 2879, and 
that the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I further ask that 
the bill be considered read a third time, 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I re-
serve the right to object. My friend 
from Oklahoma serves as the ranking 
member of the Government Operations 
Subcommittee of the Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs Com-
mittee. I sincerely appreciate that he 
brings a thoughtful approach to Fed-
eral workforce issues and that we fre-
quently have an opportunity to work 
together to make government work 
more efficiently and more effectively. 
Unfortunately, I strongly disagree 
with the legislation being put forward 
today. This proposal would roll back 
policies put in place to make sure that 
Federal workers and Federal contrac-
tors who are paid with taxpayer dollars 
are 
vaccinated 
against 
COVID–19. 
These Executive orders protect not just 
the Federal workforce all across our 
country, but they help protect their 
families and their communities. There 
are also commonsense exceptions for 
people with disabilities, with medical 
conditions, or with sincerely held reli-
gious beliefs. These policies were put in 
place both carefully and fairly. 
The American people are literally 
sick and tired of this pandemic—a pan-
demic that has already claimed over 
725,000 lives, including the lives of our 
friends, our neighbors, and our family 
members. They want this pandemic to 
end, and vaccines is how we get there. 
From the beginning of this pandemic, 
I and many of my colleagues have been 
dedicated to bringing safe and effective 
vaccines to the people who live in our 
States by investing in science and re-
search and by strengthening our do-
mestic supply chains. 
COVID–19 vaccines are now widely 
available, but we know from trusted 
scientists and public health experts 
that we need higher rates of vaccina-
tion to get this pandemic under con-
trol. The politicization of safe, effec-
tive, public health measures is making 
it harder to end this horrible pandemic. 
The legislation before us today would 
without question move us in the wrong 
direction. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
understand the statement by my friend 
from Michigan. I have to tell you, 
though, I wish this was rolled out in an 
orderly fashion. It has been 6 weeks of 
chaos and unanswered questions, and 
the Federal Government is about to 
fire thousands of Federal employees be-
cause they did not bend to their will. 
Many Federal employees asked for a 
medical exemption and were told no. 
Literally, they brought a letter from 
their doctor and were told no. Individ-
uals asked for religious accommoda-
tion and were told no, they will not get 
it. It is one thing to say it is offered; it 
is another thing to say it was actually 
extended. 
I will tell you, from talking to people 
in my State in the Federal workforce, 
they are not getting those orderly reli-
gious accommodations, those orderly 
medical exemptions. They are not get-
ting it. They are being told ‘‘No, it is a 
mandate,’’ and then they are being told 
‘‘You are about to lose your career. Is 
it worth it?’’ These are individuals lit-
erally choosing between their health 
and their job. 
By this January, I don’t know how 
many thousands of Federal employees 
we are going to have out of our system 
and how much wisdom we are going to 
lose out of all these Agencies. But this 
horrible game of chicken that the 
President is right now playing with not 
only Federal employees but with peo-
ple all over the country is a terrible 
thing to do to our economy and to indi-
viduals who are seeking the best serv-
ice. 
It is amazing to me how many indi-
viduals served through the entire pan-
demic faithfully and took great risk to 
serve their neighbors who literally the 
President is about to fire as their 
thank you. That is wrong. That is 
wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7111 
October 20, 2021 
I stood last week and talked to indi-
viduals who work for American Air-
lines, who are really concerned and 
frustrated, who love working with 
American Airlines but are now receiv-
ing a mandate coming down on them 
that they are digging in and saying: I 
am not going to do it. I have already 
had COVID. I have recovered. I have 
natural immunity. Why am I being 
asked to do this as well? 
And they are getting only that the 
President is mandating it, and: We do 
Federal work, and so it is going to be 
required. 
It is the same thing happening to 
packing companies, to manufacturers, 
to small businesses around the coun-
try. 
Let me just read you a story. One 
employee who called our office last 
week is currently in cancer treatment 
for the fourth time and is receiving an 
experimental treatment. She is being 
told that she will be terminated from 
her job November 24 if she doesn’t get 
vaccinated, because the President is re-
quiring it on everyone. 
That does not sound like an accom-
modation that is occurring because of 
medical accommodations. 
It is nice to say in DC: Talk to the 
people in your State what is actually 
happening on the ground. 
All of this push that is happening 
around healthcare workers all around 
the country, what does that really look 
like? 
When we talked to an administrator 
of one of our nursing homes. Most of 
the individuals in our nursing homes, 
thankfully, as residents and as staff, 
have been vaccinated; but some have 
had COVID, and they are concerned 
about getting the vaccine. Whether 
that is rational or not, that is where 
they are, but they have natural immu-
nity. 
This particular nursing home that we 
talked to, 20 percent of her employees 
have said that they will not take the 
vaccine. This particular nursing home 
in a rural area will close and expose all 
of those residents and their families to 
chaos because Biden said: I am losing 
patience. 
It is one thing to say we need to be 
able to push back on this pandemic. I 
absolutely agree. It is another thing to 
irrationally close down nursing homes 
that are taking care of patients that, 
by the way, were filled with people— 
frontline workers—who put their life at 
risk last year to serve people. 
And now to push those people out and 
fire them this year? 
‘‘You are welcome,’’ apparently, is 
what the President should be saying to 
them. 
All I am asking for is reason. All I 
am asking for is to consider those 44 
million Americans who have natural 
immunity and to accept what we all 
know scientifically to be true. All I am 
asking for is real medical exemptions. 
That is not irrational. All I am asking 
for is real religious accommodations. 
Those are things that should be 
straightforward, common sense, and 
doable. But for whatever reason, the 
train is barreling down the tracks. In 
the debris field is our Federal workers, 
individuals who work in private compa-
nies, healthcare workers across the 
board. 
I, just this weekend, received an 
email that was a long email from a 
very shy physician in one of our major 
hospitals in Tulsa. She told me flat 
out: I don’t seek personal attention. I 
don’t do media stuff. 
In fact, she said: I don’t even have so-
cial media at all. 
But she detailed out her healthcare 
decisions and what was going on in her 
own life and said: I do not want to re-
ceive this vaccine. 
As a physician at a major hospital in 
Tulsa, she is about to lose her job be-
cause President Biden’s patience is 
running thin. 
What do her patients do next? 
Mr. President, don’t play chicken 
with our families. This is real to them. 
They do not need to lose their job be-
cause they have medical conditions, re-
ligious accommodations, or they have 
natural immunity. They have suffered 
through COVID once, and now you are 
going to fire them for that? 
Let’s have a real dialogue, not a 
rushed ‘‘My patience is wearing thin.’’ 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Louisiana. 
REMEMBERING MICHAEL B. ENZI 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
wanted to say a couple of words about 
a couple of friends. 
I really miss Mike Enzi. I am refer-
ring, of course, to Senator Mike Enzi, 
our colleague who served the people of 
Wyoming and the people of America for 
24 years in this body. We lost him a 
couple of months ago. I tried to get out 
to his beautiful State to say good-bye, 
and I couldn’t. I couldn’t rearrange 
things. I just—I miss him. 
I was thinking about Mike this morn-
ing. I had a meeting over here early— 
not too early, about 8 o’clock. I walked 
from my little, overpriced Capitol Hill 
apartment, through the park, to the 
Capitol. The park I am talking about is 
just east of the Capitol. Mike would al-
ways walk through the park when he 
would come to vote. Not always, but 
many times he would leave his office 
and get his exercise and enjoy God’s 
beautiful day by walking through the 
park. I walked with him a couple of 
times. 
Mike was so many things, but if I had 
to describe him in three words, it 
would be ‘‘decent,’’ ‘‘smart,’’ and ‘‘one 
of the best fishermen I have ever 
known.’’ 
I want to talk about the decent part 
and what Mike Enzi meant to me. I 
mean, I can talk about his background 
and the fact that he was a giant among 
Senators and how everybody respected 
him, but everybody knows that. 
When I first got here—I think all new 
Senators feel this way. The Members of 
this body are very, very smart, and 
they are very, very driven. And at least 
for me, when I first got here, it was a 
very intimidating place. I think that is 
true for most Senators. I think if you 
ask all 100 Senators what it was like 
their first month here, 99 of them 
would tell you that they were intimi-
dated. The 100th would be lying be-
cause this is an intimidating place. 
But, you know, Mike went out of his 
way, I remember—I guess he could tell 
I was insecure—to reassure me. You 
know, every few weeks I would see him 
in the cloakroom or I would see him in 
committee, and he would say: Kennedy, 
you know, you are making a real con-
tribution to this group. 
Well, of course, I wasn’t, but it made 
me feel so good and so more sure of 
myself. And it also made me realize, 
when I reflect back on it, what a de-
cent thing it was for Mike to do. I 
mean, he had been here 24 years. He 
had his pick of chairmanship. I mean, 
he really was a giant in this body. I 
was green as a gourd, brandnew; and he 
didn’t have to do that, but he did. I 
never told him how much that meant 
to me, and I really regret not telling 
him that now. 
I feel so bad for Diana—just the most 
wonderful person in the world. I don’t 
know Mike’s children—Amy, Emily, 
and Brad—but I have a feeling, know-
ing that they are the children of Mike 
Enzi and Diana, that they are three 
wonderful Americans. 
I just wanted to say that. I was 
thinking about Mike today. I miss him. 
TRIBUTE TO ROBERT TRAVIS SCOTT 
Madam President, No. 2, we have an 
organization in Louisiana called the 
Public Affairs Research Council. It is 
one of our premiere think tanks. It is 
an independent group. They are not po-
litical. They do serious research, and 
they offer very serious suggestions 
about how we, in Louisiana, can solve 
some of our social and economic prob-
lems. We call it PAR, Public Affairs 
Research Council. 
I don’t know how long PAR has been 
around. As long as I have been in gov-
ernment, which is the late 1980s, it was 
there way before I came. I didn’t have 
time to look up when it was founded, 
but I think it is pretty much 2 years 
older than dirt. It has been there. It is 
an institution in Louisiana. 
It is privately funded. People who 
care about our State contribute money 
to do PAR’s work. I religiously read all 
of PAR’s white papers and research pa-
pers. Everybody I know who cares 
about my State takes their suggestions 
seriously. 
To be the director or the president of 
PAR, it is quite an honor. It is a lot of 
work and it is a big deal. Our president 
of PAR is retiring. He is a friend of 
mine. His name is Robert Travis Scott, 
and I want to say a word about Robert. 
Robert is a graduate of the Univer-
sity of South Carolina with high hon-
ors, a graduate of Johns Hopkins. He 
has done it all. Robert has been the 
president of PAR since 2011. But before 
that, he was the capital bureau chief 
for our Times-Picayune newspaper in

New Orleans, and that is how I got to 
know him. Robert was never an agenda 
journalist. And we know that those 
journalists, particularly in the print 
media, exist, and they exist in the elec-
tronic media. 
I couldn’t tell you today what Rob-
ert’s politics are. I don’t even know 
what party he is in. I don’t know if he 
is in a party. He was always, when he 
was a reporter, a straight shooter. He 
called it like he saw it. He played it 
straight down the middle. And if he 
thought he ought to bust you upside 
the head because you did something 
dumb in public service, he would do it, 
but he didn’t do it just in a gratuitous 
way. 
So it was no surprise to me when 
PAR asked Robert to take over run-
ning the Public Affairs Research Coun-
cil. And he did that. He has done it 
since 2011, 10 years. Robert and PAR 
have contributed so much to my State. 
His replacement is going to be a gen-
tleman by the name of Dr. Steve 
Procopio, who I know as well. Steve is 
going to do a great job. But we are 
going to miss Robert. I hope he doesn’t 
go far. 
I just wanted to come say a word 
about my good friend Robert Travis 
Scott. 
TAX CODE 
Madam President, now let me say 
one final word on a timely topic here. 
As you know, our body is going to 
soon be considering, I think, some 
changes to our Tax Code. We don’t 
know exactly what they are. 
I just want to strongly encourage my 
colleagues and my friends—because I 
like everybody in this body—if we are 
going to make changes to our Tax 
Code, to make those changes on the 
basis of sound economic principles. 
Don’t make them on the basis of class 
warfare. 
Some of the proponents of some of 
the changes that I have seen discussed 
in the media, in my opinion, don’t un-
derstand the complexity of the Amer-
ican economy. They just don’t. They 
think of our economy as it was in 
primitive times, when our ancestors 
were hunters and gatherers. 
In those days, in primitive times, 
when our ancestors were hunters and 
gatherers, the only value that was cre-
ated in the economy that we had was 
labor. It was all labor. And then, in 
those days, when somebody became 
rich, they became rich by exploiting 
the capital of others. 
In fact, that is what Marx talked 
about. Marx’s concept of the economy 
was that the only value in an economy 
is work. And if you become wealthy in 
an economy, you become wealthy as a 
result of exploiting the labor of others. 
So Marx agreed with this description 
of the—I want to say our medieval, but 
it was way before medieval times, when 
our ancestors were hunters and gath-
erers. 
That is not the American economy 
today. The American economy today is 
the greatest economy in all of human 
history because it is a marriage of cap-
ital and labor. 
And capital and labor are not antago-
nistic. They work together. Now, it is 
not without friction. I understand that. 
But that is why we have become the 
greatest economy in all of human his-
tory. And when capital joins labor and 
the two contribute and play their own 
role, we are able to all work and save 
and invest and fund the research and 
development and do the innovative 
things that have given all of us the 
greatest quality of life in all of human 
history. So capital is not a bad thing; 
it is a good thing. 
And there has been a lot of talk 
around here about billionaires—bad, 
bad billionaires; they are not paying 
their fair share. I have never com-
pletely understood how you determine 
what the fair share is of somebody. 
Let me put it another way. I don’t 
understand what the fair share is of 
what somebody else has worked for. I 
don’t know what my fair share is of 
what Madam President’s—what she has 
worked for. It is yours. You worked for 
it. 
But that aside, this talk about the 
bad, bad billionaires and they don’t pay 
their fair share and they are hurting 
our economy and they only got rich 
based on exploiting other people’s 
labor, I think, shows a gross misunder-
standing of the complexity of the U.S. 
economy and a gross misunderstanding 
of free enterprise. And I hope we don’t 
lose sight of that as we go about the 
process of making changes to our Tax 
Code. 
Let me say it again. If we make 
changes to our Tax Code, let’s don’t 
make them on the basis of class war-
fare. Let’s make them on the basis of 
sound economic principles. 
So congratulations to Robert Travis 
Scott from PAR. Robert, I hope you 
have a wonderful retirement. Don’t be 
moving back to South Carolina or Bal-
timore or other places. Stay in Lou-
isiana. 
And, Mike, I miss you. Mike Enzi, I 
miss you. 
I have heard it said before that—I 
didn’t say this, now; I am just repeat-
ing it—most Senators believe in God, 
and the rest of them think they are 
God. Mike Enzi was in the former cat-
egory. Just a great man. Smart, good 
fisherman. But most of all, he was de-
cent. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF SAULE OMAROVA 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
rise today to discuss President Biden’s 
nominee to serve as one of our Nation’s 
chief banking regulators. 
About a month ago, President Biden 
announced his intention to nominate 
Cornell University Law Professor Saule 
Omarova to serve as Comptroller of the 
Currency. 
I was on the floor recently, and I 
spoke about her nomination. And I 
noted at the time that she has been 
celebrated on the far left for promoting 
ideas that she herself has described as 
‘‘radical.’’ It is one of the few things on 
which I agree with her. These are rad-
ical ideas. In fact, they are very radical 
ideas. 
And most disturbing about this is 
they 
demonstrate—these 
ideas 
of 
hers—a very clear aversion to Amer-
ica’s free enterprise system at a very 
fundamental level, despite the fact 
that our free enterprise system has 
produced an incredible level of pros-
perity and standard of living. 
I have to say, I don’t think I have 
ever seen a more radical choice for any 
regulatory spot in our Federal Govern-
ment that I can think of than Pro-
fessor Omarova. And let me be clear. 
That assessment is based on the things 
that Professor Omarova has written 
and said in her own words, often quite 
recently. 
So today I want to focus on just one 
of the radical ideas that she presented 
in great detail in a paper that she 
wrote in 2016—not exactly ancient his-
tory. This is her plan to have the Fed-
eral Government set wages and prices 
for large sectors of the U.S. economy; 
in fact, the most important goods and 
services in our economy. 
Under her plan, the Federal Govern-
ment would designate—and these are 
her 
words—‘‘systemically 
important 
prices and indexes’’ or ‘‘SIPIs.’’ She 
creates an acronym for these things; 
she calls them SIPIs—for the Federal 
Reserve to regulate. 
So she details five different ap-
proaches, different ways, that the gov-
ernment could regulate and take con-
trol over these prices of these system-
ically important goods. And they are 
all—it is all a terrible idea based on the 
completely 
erroneous 
premise 
that 
somehow the government knows what 
the price of these things should be. 
But among all of them, one that is 
maybe the most troubling is one that 
she describes here. And this is what 
Professor Omarova argued. She says: 
‘‘The . . . final regulatory option we 
think worth considering is . . . price 
maintenance—typically within some 
band—through OMOs.’’ 
Now, OMO stands for open market 
operations, and that is an operation 
that the Federal Reserve engages in. 
But the Fed uses open market oper-
ations—or 
OMOs, 
in 
Professor 
Omarova’s lexicon—to just buy and sell 
securities for one purpose, and that is 
to manage the amount of money in the 
supply—in the economy, to manage 
monetary policy, to do it by managing 
the supply of money. That is it. 
What Professor Omarova is advo-
cating for is a radical departure from 
this very, very narrow and limited ac-
tivity. What her plan would do is to 
empower the Fed—and these are her

words—‘‘to buy and sell in markets . . . 
with a view to keeping particular [sys-
temically important prices] within par-
ticular bands thought necessary for the 
purposes of maintaining systemic sta-
bility.’’ 
Wow. Now, what kind of prices does 
Professor Omarova have in mind for 
the Fed to control by buying and sell-
ing these commodities? Well, she tells 
us. She says: 
Various candidate SIPIs here come to 
mind. . . . 
Certain 
sensitive 
commodity 
prices—those for widely used fuels, food-
stuffs, and some other raw materials, for ex-
ample—constitute another class of can-
didates. Finally, wage or salary indices con-
stitute yet another class of candidates. 
Now, here are some of the other can-
didates for price controls that she has 
in mind: ‘‘home prices,’’ ‘‘productive 
inputs’’ such as ‘‘energy,’’ ‘‘certain . . . 
metals, and other natural resources.’’ 
In other words, like all the most im-
portant commodities in America, under 
Professor Omarova’s radical plan, it 
would be the government that would 
set these prices rather than a free mar-
ket 
determining 
how 
these 
prices 
should be set. The government would 
control everything from the size of 
your paycheck to the amount you pay 
at the grocery store for a gallon of 
milk or a gallon of gasoline. 
There is no more allocation of scarce 
goods based on who values them the 
most—the brilliance of the way that a 
spontaneous 
market 
allocates 
re-
sources automatically to their best and 
highest use and enables us to have the 
lowest possible cost for the most pos-
sible goods. None of that. No more. 
We will have a committee—it is 
called the Fed Open Market Com-
mittee—and 
they 
will 
dictate 
the 
prices that we will pay and how the re-
sources of America will be allocated. 
Now, if her radical idea sounds famil-
iar, that is because it is familiar. It has 
been tried—been tried several times— 
repeatedly, and every single time it has 
failed spectacularly, time and again, in 
all the centrally planned economies in 
the world, especially the Soviet Union. 
In fact, Soviet efforts to control 
prices in their economy were so abys-
mal, they failed so badly that they 
spawned countless jokes within the So-
viet Union that illustrate the folly of 
central planning, the inherent impos-
sibility of central planning. 
One of my favorites is about a guy 
who walks into a store. He walks up to 
the shopkeeper and says: You don’t 
have any meat, do you? 
And the shopkeeper replies: No, we 
don’t have any fish. It is the store next 
door that doesn’t have any meat. 
So we can laugh about these things 
that people living under the misery of 
the Soviet Union, they had a sort of 
gallows humor about the misery of 
their circumstances. 
But the fact is, it was this notion 
that a really smart committee at the 
center of the government could dictate 
the prices and the allocation of all re-
sources; that idea is what caused the 
misery—ultimately, of course, caused 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
This is what happens anywhere where 
governments 
try 
to 
control 
what 
should be left to the free men and 
women in terms of allocating re-
sources. Government-run economies, 
like 
the 
very 
one 
that 
Professor 
Omarova 
is 
proposing—they 
don’t 
work. 
And let me stress a point that I have 
made before about Professor Omarova. 
The fact that she was born and raised 
in the Soviet Union has absolutely 
nothing to do with whether or not the 
Senate should confirm her to run a 
major financial agency. 
There are some unbelievably wonder-
ful, successful, patriotic, terrific Amer-
ican citizens who had the misfortune of 
growing up behind the Iron Curtain. 
That has nothing to do with whether or 
not she is qualified for this job. It is 
her advocacy for the policies that, in 
disturbing ways, resemble those of the 
Soviet Union—that is what should in-
form our judgment about whether this 
person should be the chief regulator of 
the Nation’s federally chartered banks. 
Now, Professor Omarova would likely 
argue that her centrally planned econ-
omy would be different. That is always 
the case. This time we will get social-
ism right. As her paper notes, the Fed 
does already use open market oper-
ations to implement monetary policy. 
That is true. So why not let the Fed 
use a similar mechanism to set and 
maintain stable prices for all kinds of 
important assets? 
Well, the answer is simple: Making 
decisions 
about 
what 
individual— 
maybe dozens, maybe hundreds of indi-
vidual assets across something as com-
plex as our entire economy, what they 
should cost, how they should be allo-
cated, that is an impossibly complex 
endeavor. There is no technocrat, no 
bureau, no committee, no agency— 
there is no entity that can figure that 
out. 
It is the organic decisions, individual 
decisions, of millions of free people 
that spontaneously create the alloca-
tion that maximizes the well-being of 
the people of a free society. 
By the way, there is a pretty strong 
case to be made that the government 
doesn’t do such a great job on mone-
tary policy either. People that we have 
serious doubts about how well they set 
the price of a single thing—namely, the 
U.S. dollar—do we want them directly 
controlling the prices of everything or 
at least everything that is important? 
I think not. 
So the more I read the radical ideas 
that Professor Omarova has advocated 
for and the more I think about the 
damage this would do to our economy 
and our society, the more troubled I 
am by her nomination. So I strongly 
urge President Biden to reconsider his 
nomination, his decision to nominate 
her. 
THE ECONOMY 
Madam President, I have one other 
topic I want to address this afternoon, 
and it has to do with this really ex-
traordinary and very reckless tax-and- 
spending spree that our Democratic 
colleagues seem determined to attempt 
to pass. 
Now, there has been a lot of focus, 
understandably, on the staggering size 
of this, right? Is this going to be the 
$3.5 trillion of the budget resolution 
that passed here and is that a com-
promise from $6 trillion that some of 
our Democratic colleagues preferred or 
7 trillion—or will it be 1.5 or 2? 
OK. I would just say that there is no 
doubt in my mind, wherever this ends 
up, if it ends up anywhere, it is going 
to do a lot of damage. It is going to do 
a lot of damage to our economy. And I 
think that is probably why there are 
significant reservations, even among 
Democrats, and there is not any sup-
port among any Republicans for the 
various iterations of this bill. 
At the heart of it, what this bill does 
is several things, but one of them is to 
attempt to redefine the very role of the 
Federal Government in our society. 
And what I am referring to is the at-
tempt to have the Federal Government 
provide the needs—like all kinds of 
basic needs, so basically anyone in the 
middle class—from cradle to grave. It 
is free pre-K, free childcare, free paid 
leave, 
free 
community 
college—oh, 
maybe that one got dropped. I mean, 
many of them aren’t even means-test-
ed. They are not meant to be means- 
tested. If they are, you can have many 
multiples of the median family income 
and still qualify. It is all about making 
the middle class dependent on govern-
ment. What a terrible idea. 
But I will have more to say on an-
other occasion about the idea of put-
ting the entire middle class on the 
dole. Instead, I want to focus for a 
minute on a particularly ill-conceived 
provision on the tax side of this be-
cause it has massive tax increases as 
part of this proposal. And one of them 
is the huge increase in the U.S. global 
minimum tax. When we did tax reform 
of 2017 and brought about the end of 
corporate 
inversions, 
among 
other 
things, we established a global min-
imum tax at a low rate of 10 percent. 
Now, what the Biden administration 
is proposing is going to completely 
upend the tax reform of 2017. We prob-
ably all remember the big announce-
ments about this international agree-
ment on multinational taxation. It 
consists of two pillars, as you may re-
call. 
Pillar 1 is this unprecedented change 
that would allow foreign countries to 
tax American companies based on the 
sales of the American companies into 
the foreign country. We have never had 
a tax policy based on that. You could 
tax the income of a company that is 
based in your country; you don’t get to 
reach into the income of a company 
based in some other country. 
Many of our allies and friends around 
the world have long wanted to grab 
some income tax from American com-
panies, and American administrations

October 20, 2021 
have fought it. This administration has 
embraced it. 
It is a big revenue transfer from U.S. 
Treasury to the treasuries of other 
countries. 
Unsurprisingly, 
this 
fea-
ture—this pillar 1—has been a high pri-
ority for these other countries. As I 
say, they have long sought this source 
of money. That is pillar 1. 
Pillar 2 is an agreement by OECD 
countries to impose a 15-percent min-
imum tax on the foreign income of 
their multinational countries. 
Now, why was this important? Well, 
this is very important to the Biden ad-
ministration because they want to 
raise the tax imposed on foreign in-
come of U.S. multinationals, and they 
at least implicitly acknowledge that if 
foreign countries don’t do likewise—if 
they don’t have a very burdensome tax 
regime like we are going to create 
under the Biden plan—then we would 
be at a huge competitive disadvantage, 
and multinationals would have no 
choice but to flee the United States 
and many, many jobs going with them. 
So that is pillar 2. 
Now, here is one of the big problems 
with this whole arrangement, this 
whole negotiation. As I said before, the 
administration has implicitly acknowl-
edged that if the rest of the world 
doesn’t impose this huge minimum tax 
on their multinationals, we would be at 
a huge competitive disadvantage. That 
is why they negotiate with us. But 
there is a very real possibility that 
some 
of 
these 
countries—many 
of 
them—may not implement a global 
minimum tax, despite the tentative 
agreement. And there are at least two 
reasons. 
One is, these countries have only re-
luctantly agreed to pillar 2 in the first 
place. They didn’t think this was such 
a great idea, but they agreed to it in 
return for pillar 1—right?—in return 
for the commitment that they would 
be able to grab some of the tax revenue 
that we normally collect. 
There is a problem with that. Imple-
menting pillar 1 requires changing the 
treaties—the multilateral or the bilat-
eral tax treaties—that the United 
States has with these other countries. 
Changing the treaty requires a two- 
thirds vote in the Senate because under 
the Constitution, ratification of a trea-
ty is subject to a two-thirds vote. 
Well, guess what. I don’t think there 
is two-thirds of the U.S. Senate pre-
pared to vote for this tax giveaway to 
these other countries. So if I am right, 
then pillar 1 never gets implemented. If 
pillar 1 never gets implemented, then 
the sole motivation for these countries 
to raise their corporate global min-
imum tax goes away. 
So I am not sure how they square 
this circle. And at a minimum, I would 
think they ought to sort this out—the 
administration, that is—before they 
just go ahead and put American compa-
nies at a huge competitive disadvan-
tage. 
By the way, even if they get their 
way exactly, we are going to be at a 
huge competitive disadvantage. The 
best they could negotiate from OECD 
countries was a global minimum tax of 
15 percent. 
Their own proposal has an effective 
global minimum tax rate of 26 percent 
that we will be imposing on our own 
companies. That is a pretty big dif-
ference on the margin, and it creates 
an incentive to have your multi-
national 
headquartered 
somewhere 
other than the United States of Amer-
ica. That is a very bad idea. 
So I think there is a very substantial 
risk that when the administration gets 
wrapped around the axle because they 
are finding they can’t get the two- 
thirds majority in the Senate for us to 
inflict this wound on ourselves—on our 
own economy—well, the rest of the 
world is going to rethink raising their 
minimum tax. And yet—and yet—our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
seem 
deter-
mined to move ahead with this huge 
tax increase and all this spending. And 
who knows, maybe it passes any day 
now. 
But let me be clear, this is a destruc-
tive tax increase. It will hurt American 
workers, make the United States a less 
competitive 
place 
to 
do 
business, 
whether or not the rest of the world 
follows suit. And so I would just urge 
my colleagues, don’t do this damage. I 
don’t know what people think they are 
fixing. 
In 2019—just 1 year after the full im-
plementation of our tax reform—we 
had the best economy of my lifetime. 
There was an end to corporate inver-
sions. There was an economic boom. 
We had a record low unemployment 
rate—alltime record low unemploy-
ment for African Americans, Asian 
Americans, 
Hispanic 
Americans, 
women. Workforce participation rate 
was at multidecade highs. Wages were 
growing, and wages were growing fast-
est for the lowest income workers. 
Under our regulatory and tax reforms, 
we were narrowing the income gap and 
allowing Americans to create wealth 
and prosperity and achieve a higher 
standard of living. 
I ask my colleagues: What was so bad 
about that? What is really so bad about 
the best economy of my lifetime—ris-
ing wages, a better standard of living, 
and a narrowing of the income gap? 
What was so bad about that that you 
want to throw it out the door, out the 
window? I don’t get that. I don’t get 
that at all. 
It is not too late. Maybe we will be 
fortunate enough to be able to dodge 
this. But if we don’t, a lot of families, 
workers, Americans of all walks of life 
will have a lower standard of living as 
a result of this very ill-conceived tax 
policy in the Biden administration. 
With that, I yield the floor.

EDUCATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
America’s education system. 
As a result of the pandemic, parents 
have had a front-row seat to their kids’ 
education. Parents are now engaged 
with their kids’ schools much more 
than ever before. Many parents have 
had to make tough decisions about a 
number of things during the pandemic, 
but especially about their children’s 
education. 
Yet parental involvement, I believe, 
is a good thing for kids in our schools. 
The more parental involvement, the 
better. Parents deserve a say in what 
their kids learn and how best to learn 
it. 
But all across America, school boards 
and teachers unions and city councils 
have been outraged to see parents in-
volved as they have been. 
Many parents are furious right now. 
In many cases, they have found out 
their kids were spending more time on 
liberal ideology than they were on 
science or on math. 
Earlier this year, the State of Cali-
fornia proposed teaching math—hard 
to believe, but this is what they said— 
from a social justice perspective—math 
from a social justice perspective. 
Parents, appropriately, were furious, 
and the proposal was not rejected com-
pletely, but just postponed until next 
year. 
Oregon now allows students to grad-
uate—graduate—without proving they 
are proficient in reading, in writing, or 
in math. 
San Francisco schools spent the en-
tire last year closed, yet the San Fran-
cisco school board had spare time to 
propose changing the name of Abraham 
Lincoln High School. Kids are not in 
school, but the school board had plenty 
of time to consider and propose chang-
ing the name of Abraham Lincoln High 
School. 
Well, parents, again, were enraged 
and this proposal was dropped. 
It is very obvious why so many par-
ents all across the country are so angry 
right now. They work hard. They pay 
their taxes. And what they see day in 
and day out are Democratic politicians 
hurting their kids’ future, getting in 
the way of the education that parents 
believe their children need. 
Last week, we saw even more proof. 
The Department of Education pub-
lished the National Assessment of Edu-
cational Progress. It comes out every 5 
years. It was time. It is the Nation’s re-
port card. This year’s report card 
shows test scores in math and in read-
ing have plummeted. This was the first 
time these scores have dropped in 50 
years. 
The lesson is obvious: We are spend-
ing too much time away from the 
things that students ought to be spend-
ing their time on. We need to spend 
less time on ideology, more time on 
education of the basics—real knowl-
edge, real skills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7115 
October 20, 2021 
Many school boards across the coun-
try refuse to listen. In fact, the Na-
tional School Boards Association com-
plained to the Biden administration 
about angry parents. Now the Attorney 
General is treating angry parents like 
criminals. The Attorney General of the 
United States is deciding that angry 
parents are to be treated like crimi-
nals. Attorney General Garland has or-
dered Federal prosecutors to work with 
local police to form ‘‘strategies for ad-
dressing threats against school admin-
istrators, board members, teachers, 
and staff.’’ 
The Department of Justice says it 
will form a task force on these alleged 
threats against school boards. The task 
force is going to include representa-
tives from the Department’s Criminal 
Division, from the National Security 
Division, the Civil Rights Division, and 
Federal prosecutors, as well as the FBI. 
Joe Biden is sending in the cavalry to 
school board meetings to focus on par-
ents rather than focusing on the edu-
cation the children need and deserve. 
He is sending the National Security Di-
vision after moms and dads because 
they are concerned about their chil-
dren’s education. 
After the Attorney General’s order, I 
joined with 10 of my Republican col-
leagues and demanded a legal justifica-
tion from Attorney General Garland. I 
still haven’t received a response. 
We have also found out that Attor-
ney General Garland has a family 
member who helps schools develop left-
wing curriculum. The Attorney Gen-
eral’s family member is helping schools 
developing leftwing curriculum. The 
Attorney General’s son-in-law owns a 
company with millions and millions of 
dollars in government contracts—con-
tracts by the Attorney General’s son- 
in-law—contracts 
with 
schools 
all 
across America. 
Well, maybe it is a coincidence, and 
maybe it is not. Attorney General Gar-
land needs to tell the American people 
whether this played a role in his deci-
sion to treat parents like criminals. 
Yet the problem is much bigger than 
the Attorney General of the United 
States. The problem is how Democrats 
treat and think about parents and 
working families. 
The former Governor of the State of 
Virginia said recently: 
I don’t think parents should be telling 
schools what they can teach. 
This is the former Governor of Vir-
ginia: 
I don’t think parents should be telling 
schools what they can teach. 
Last month, Senator MIKE
BRAUN 
asked 
the 
Secretary 
of 
Education 
about the role of parents in education. 
He asked if parents were ‘‘the primary 
stakeholder’’ in their kids’ education. 
Secretary 
Cardona 
said 
this: 
‘‘They’re an important stakeholder.’’ 
In other words, they are not the pri-
mary stakeholders. Parents are not the 
primary stakeholders. 
Is it any surprise so many parents 
are deciding to educate their children 
at home? 
So who does the Secretary of Edu-
cation think is the primary educator of 
our children? The union bosses? Are 
they the primary educators of our chil-
dren? 
Democrats act like kids are the prop-
erty of the schools. And schools, of 
course, are the property—in the minds 
of the Democrats—of the teachers 
unions. Parents have every right to be 
upset with what is happening in the 
public schools all across this Nation. 
Parents have every right to demand 
real improvements. 
It is time for the Democrats to stop 
taking orders from the teachers unions 
and start listening to parents and to 
the students. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over 
the last couple of years, our Demo-
cratic colleagues have suggested a 
range of unrealistic and downright 
harmful policies in our shared goal— 
and I emphasize the words ‘‘shared 
goal’’—to reduce carbon emissions. But 
it is not just a question of what you are 
doing; it is a question of how you are 
going about doing it. The way they are 
going about doing it is going to raise 
the prices of electricity, gasoline, and 
all forms of energy on people on fixed 
incomes, people who are seniors living 
on Social Security, and others. They 
have proposed everything from the so-
cialist agenda that is the Green New 
Deal to more targeted, but no more re-
alistic, zero net emission mandates. 
Now, we all know that energy transi-
tion occurs at all times. I have traveled 
to India—perhaps the Presiding Officer 
has—and to other countries where peo-
ple literally cook their food using cow 
manure patties, dried cow manure. I re-
member Prime Minister Modi coming 
to Houston, TX, during an event that 
we called ‘‘Howdy, Modi!’’ when he her-
alded the use of increased access to 
cooking gas so that his constituents, 
Indians, wouldn’t have to use dried cow 
dung to cook their food—that rep-
resents progress—or wouldn’t have to 
use wood chips anymore. 
Then the transition was to coal, then 
to natural gas, nuclear, and other 
forms of energy. So energy transition 
occurs at all times. The only question 
is how it comes about, whether it is as 
a result of higher taxes and forced gov-
ernment mandates or whether it is 
which form of energy competes favor-
ably for consumers because of its cost 
and availability. 
Well, of all of the dangerous policy 
proposals, I think the reckless tax-and- 
spending-spree bill takes the cake. 
This is the so-called reconciliation bill 
that is now pending over in the House, 
or is being negotiated. Nobody has ac-
tually seen it yet, but we keep hearing 
what is in it, and we keep hearing that 
the left is negotiating with the far left. 
This is what happens when our Demo-
cratic colleagues don’t include people 
in the opposing political party to try 
to build consensus. It is pretty hard, 
particularly when you only have 50 
votes. 
This isn’t like FDR’s New Deal after 
the Great Depression, wherein he had 
huge majorities. I think what our 
Democratic colleagues are finding out 
is that, when they try to go it alone, 
passing these radical policies is really, 
really hard to do because you have no 
room for error. 
This reminds me of the yellow jack-
ets protests in France, starting back in 
2018, as to what is happening now with 
some of these mandates and these high-
er taxes. This was, as you may recall, a 
social movement of French working- 
class families who felt disenfranchised 
from the urban elite, who ‘‘can focus 
on the end of the world,’’ they said, 
‘‘while we’re worrying about the end of 
the month.’’ I think it is pretty apt to 
where we are today. This reckless tax- 
and-spending spree not only compiles 
the most irresponsible policies into one 
massive bill, as I said, but our Demo-
cratic colleagues, along with the White 
House, are trying to pass it in a 50–50 
Senate, on a party-line vote. 
Well, talk about bad timing. This 
comes at a time when Texans and other 
Americans are already being pummeled 
by rising costs, especially at the gas 
pump. Inflation is rearing its ugly head 
everywhere in terms of energy costs, 
groceries, 
commodities, 
and 
with 
things like a washing machine or a new 
refrigerator. Try buying a new house, 
and you will see the cost has just 
jumped dramatically. 
It is a demonstrable fact that, in the 
last year, gasoline costs have gone up 
55 percent. The average price today is 
about $3.33 a gallon. A year ago, it was 
$2.16 a gallon. For somebody who drives 
a pickup truck—and we have a lot of 
pickup trucks in Texas—it would have 
cost $56 for a tank of gas a year ago, 
but, today, it is $87—a $31 increase. 
Unfortunately, 
sky-high 
gasoline 
prices aren’t the only growing drain on 
family budgets. As I mentioned, elec-
tricity, groceries, clothing, eating out 
occasionally 
at 
a 
restaurant, 
and 
countless other expenses are on the 
rise. Prices are so high that inflation is 
outpacing wage growth, essentially 
giving workers a pay cut. Let me say 
that again. If you are earning, let’s 
say, $10,000 a year—just to pick a num-
ber—and inflation rises like it does 
with gasoline costs, you are effectively 
getting a pay cut because of the rising 
costs of goods and services. 
But that doesn’t seem to deter our 
Democratic colleagues from moving 
full steam ahead on legislation that 
would drive these costs even higher. 
After spending nearly $2 billion earlier 
this year on a party-line vote, our col-
leagues are back for round 2, and this 
time they are prepared to take a 
wrecking ball to one of our crown jew-
els in this country, which is our energy 
sector. By drowning the energy sector 
in tax hikes or in increased regulations 
and costs, our Democratic colleagues 
think that they can achieve their green

October 20, 2021 
energy dreams with no consequences, 
but, of course, that is just a dangerous 
fantasy. 
It sort of reminds me of what I saw 
reported today by NPR. NPR reports: 
‘‘Despite climate change promises, gov-
ernments plan to ramp up fossil fuel 
production.’’ Indeed, the President and 
members of this body are going to be 
heading to a climate conference in 
Glasgow, Scotland, starting on October 
31. As you know, usually what happens 
at those conferences, just like at the 
Paris climate conference in 2015, is 
that governments make extravagant 
promises to reduce emissions and to 
eliminate fossil fuels, including coal 
and oil and gas, in favor of clean en-
ergy. 
Now, I am not deprecating clean en-
ergy. In Texas, we believe in an ‘‘all of 
the above’’ energy policy. We produce 
more electricity from wind turbines 
than any other State in the Nation. So 
I am certainly not bad-mouthing clean 
energy, but it has to play a role and 
not dominate to the exclusion of other 
forms of energy. 
But, as the NPR article points out, 
‘‘despite lofty commitments [made] by 
governments to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, they are still planning,’’ ac-
cording to this U.N. report that was 
just issued, ‘‘to extract huge amounts 
of energy from fossil fuels in the com-
ing years.’’ 
This report was published on Wednes-
day, today, and it details how the 
world’s largest fossil fuel producers 
plan to carry on using coal, gas, and oil 
despite promises made in Paris in 2015. 
So it really makes you wonder what is 
going on when these political leaders 
go to places like Glasgow or Paris, 
make extravagant promises, and then 
come back home and break those prom-
ises. 
Well, I think I know what is hap-
pening here because, just like in 
France in 2018, when the government 
tried to impose a new fuel tax on con-
sumers, the yellow jackets protested. 
They said: You are worried about the 
end of the world. We are worried about 
how we will pay our bills through the 
end of the month. 
I think a similar phenomenon is oc-
curring now because none of these 
green energy fantasies come cheap. 
That is another reason energy costs are 
going higher. Whether you are talking 
about energy or agriculture or any 
other sector of the economy, higher 
taxes, which are what our colleagues 
are attempting to assess against the 
energy sector, always mean higher 
prices for consumers. 
Companies don’t absorb those costs. 
They pass them right along to con-
sumers in the form of increased costs. 
In fact, many businesses can’t absorb 
increased taxes and keep their prices 
stable because they simply can’t oper-
ate in the black, and they will go bank-
rupt. So businesses just don’t take the 
hits that keep on coming. They will 
raise prices; they will lay off employ-
ees or will implement any combination 
of cost-cutting measures, and that is 
exactly what this pie-in-the-sky, green 
energy fantasy bill contained in the 
reconciliation legislation would spur. 
This year, as I have pointed out, has 
already given us the highest gas prices 
since 2014. Now, I just did this year 
over year, but they are the highest 
prices we have seen since 2014, and I 
have no doubt that President Biden’s 
tax hikes will send those prices at the 
pump even higher just at a time when 
we are beginning to sound the alarm 
bells 
over 
inflation, 
including 
by 
Democratic-leaning 
economists 
like 
Larry 
Summers, 
who 
sounded 
the 
alarm over inflation. 
I am old enough to remember when 
inflation was ranked at about 20 per-
cent, and interest rates were up almost 
at 20 percent. People had to pay huge 
amounts of money or borrow huge 
amounts of money and pay exorbitant 
interest rates because of inflation. 
We are in danger of getting back to 
those bad old days. The proposal our 
Democratic colleagues are trying to 
ram through Congress would increase 
taxes—already paid by energy compa-
nies—on income earned not in the 
United States but globally. It also adds 
a new tax, the Superfund excise tax, 
which was eliminated 25 years ago. 
They want to add that back on top. 
The Democrats want to resurrect this 
tax and force energy companies to pay 
more on every barrel of crude oil that 
is used in the United States. 
Once again, the burden won’t be, ulti-
mately, on the energy and chemical 
companies. It will fall on consumers, 
who are already struggling post-COVID 
to get back on the job and pay the bills 
and provide for their families—only to 
be met with a kick in the teeth known 
as Bidenflation. 
The middle class won’t just be foot-
ing the bill for tax hikes on companies. 
This is, really, sort of an elitist irony. 
The Biden reconciliation bill would 
force middle-class families to subsidize 
the purchase of electric vehicles for 
wealthy Americans. Not only are we 
going to raise prices on you through 
tax increases, but we are going to take 
money out of your pocket and give it 
to rich people who can afford to buy 
these expensive electric vehicles. This 
bill provides a tax credit for electric 
vehicle purchases even if the vehicle is 
made completely or substantially in 
China. Won’t they love that. 
On top of that, you get a bigger tax 
credit for electric cars built in union 
shops—some of the greatest political 
friends of the Democratic Party. Our 
colleagues haven’t provided a very 
good explanation for this, but I, for 
one, find it hard to believe that union- 
built electric vehicles are any greener 
or cleaner or emit less than nonunion- 
built vehicles. This is just a big wet 
kiss for a political constituency. 
As a reminder, unlike gas-powered 
vehicle drivers, EV drivers don’t pay 
any money into the highway trust 
fund. Now, if you buy a gallon of gaso-
line, I think it is 18 cents on the gallon 
that goes into the highway trust fund 
that is used to build and maintain our 
bridges and roadways. 
Because of more use of electric vehi-
cles that don’t pay any money into the 
highway trust fund, that trust fund is 
going broke. 
So the tax breaks for the rich just 
keep on coming. They take money 
from middle-class families, give it to 
rich folks so they can buy fancy elec-
tric vehicles, courtesy of the American 
taxpayer. 
I also have concerns about how the 
proposal that is being considered by 
the White House and our Democratic 
colleagues—how it would impact our 
energy security. 
Over the last several decades, we 
have made incredible strides. Thanks 
to great investment, innovation, and 
expertise in the energy sector, we have 
made great strides to reduce our de-
pendency on other countries to keep 
the lights on in the United States. 
After all, we don’t want a repeat of 
the 1970s energy crisis. 
Now, I know a lot of these young 
folks who are here serving as pages 
may not have been around in the 1970s, 
but they can look it up online. 
Here is what happened: When the 
U.S. supported Israel in the Yom 
Kippur war in 1973, the Arab members 
of OPEC—the Organization of Petro-
leum 
Exporting 
Countries—they 
weren’t happy. 
What did they do? 
They banned the sale of crude oil to 
the United States—cut us off—and it 
sent shock waves throughout our coun-
try. As you might imagine, such was 
our dependency on imported oil from 
the Middle East. Despite some strong 
domestic oil production, we were still 
relying at that time heavily on im-
ports, and once the supply was cut off, 
prices quadrupled. 
Many gas stations simply couldn’t 
serve the demand, and when they 
could, they basically made you get an 
appointment to come fill up your gas 
tank. 
Some States banned neon signs to 
cut down on energy use, and a number 
of towns asked their citizens not to put 
up Christmas lights because of the 
drain on the grid. 
It was a slap across the face, a hard 
dose of reality that brought America’s 
energy dependence to light and under-
scored the need to increase our domes-
tic production and resources and wean 
ourselves off of this dependency—this 
dangerous dependency on imports. 
And that is what we did. Thanks to 
incredible investment and innovation 
in the energy sector and something 
that has come to be known as the shale 
revolution—named for a way to basi-
cally get oil and gas out of a rock—the 
tide of the energy landscape geopoliti-
cally turned in our favor. 
These efforts were so successful that 
in 2015, the U.S. lifted the crude oil ex-
port ban that was put in place in the 
seventies. Back when we were depend-
ent on imports, we said: You can’t ex-
port it because we need not only what

we can produce, but what we can im-
port. 
We lifted that in 2015 because Amer-
ican energy producers were producing 
so much oil and gas. 
And, in fact, rather than import en-
ergy, including natural gas, we turned 
around what were built originally as 
LNG—liquefied 
natural 
gas—import 
terminals and created export terminals 
so we could send that low-cost energy 
to our friends and allies around the 
world. 
But our Democratic colleagues seem 
to have a short-term memory problem. 
They seem to have forgotten about our 
history. 
After years of building our energy 
independence and strengthening our 
energy security, they want to turn 
back the clock. The tax hikes they are 
trying to impose on energy producers 
would ensure that the United States, 
once again, is reliant on other coun-
tries, like Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, 
and Venezuela, for our energy needs. 
The dangers ought to be obvious. 
We should never ever put ourselves in 
a position where we are reliant on any 
other country for us to keep our lights 
on, to operate our vehicles, for our 
small businesses to be able to operate, 
for us to be able to get electricity from 
a wall socket when we plug in an appli-
ance. 
So we shouldn’t be dependent on our 
adversaries or any other country for 
our energy needs when we can produce 
it here in America; and by exporting it 
to friends and allies around the world, 
we can actually liberate them. 
Recently, I was in on a trip with 
some Senate colleagues to the Balkins, 
in a number of countries that used to 
be part of the old Soviet Union but 
which are now independent countries, 
many of which are part of NATO and 
the European Union. 
And one of the things they brought 
up time and time again is their desire 
to have a diverse source of energy be-
cause they know—they know—that if 
they depend on Russian gas, that Mr. 
Putin could turn off the spigot and put 
them in mortal jeopardy. And that is 
why it is important for us to be able to 
continue to export and not be depend-
ent on imported energy ourselves. 
President 
Biden 
unintentionally 
demonstrated the hypocrisy of some of 
his policies earlier this year when he 
literally begged OPEC to increase pro-
duction to bring down these prices. 
An 
American 
President 
basically 
shutting down American energy pro-
duction and begging Russia and Saudi 
Arabia to please sell us the oil and gas 
we need so we can bring down prices at 
the pump—it is unbelievable. 
If the President is worried about af-
fordable energy, he needs to stop push-
ing policies that will drive up these 
prices. 
And it is not just gasoline. It is elec-
tricity, you name it. 
Well, Texans are already facing high 
gas prices. Household energy bills, your 
utility bill, is on the rise. This is not 
the time to make it more expensive for 
families to pay for the energy they 
need. 
As I mentioned, Texas has always 
been a proud supporter of an all-of-the- 
above energy strategy. We are recog-
nized for the might of our oil and gas 
sector for sure, but a lot of folks don’t 
realize we are a leader in renewable en-
ergy as well. In fact, we produce one- 
quarter of all of the wind energy in the 
United States. If we were a country— 
and we were once—we would be the 
fifth largest wind energy producer in 
the world. 
And we have no plans of stopping 
there. We are also making serious 
strides in energy innovation through 
cutting-edge carbon capture and stor-
age projects. That is the answer. It is 
called innovation. Not more taxes, not 
more regulations that raise prices, but 
innovation, things that literally suck 
carbon out of the environment, deposit 
it in the ground in some of these injec-
tion sites so we can actually produce 
more oil and gas, and keep the carbon 
sequestered 
in 
the 
ground 
perma-
nently. 
So we need to find a balance—some-
thing that is too often missing here in 
Washington, 
DC—between 
conserva-
tion, production, and economic power. 
That balance will not be found by im-
posing heavy-handed regulations or 
taxes that drive up the cost for con-
sumers and that benefit our adver-
saries. 
Like the rest of the reckless tax-and- 
spending spree, the cost of this energy 
proposal far, far exceeds its benefits. 
There is a better way to do this. 
The Biden administration has man-
aged to compound the already unprece-
dented challenges facing our energy 
sector here in America. American en-
ergy keeps America and much of the 
rest of the world running, and the ad-
ministration and Congress need to take 
action to support a strong, post-pan-
demic recovery, and not get in the way. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, 
AND
RELATED
AGENCIES
APPROPRIATIONS 
BILL FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to introduce 
the Department of the Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Bill for Fiscal Year 2022. Of 
course, that is the fiscal year that 
began on October 1. 
Like my colleagues on the Appropria-
tions Committee, I am thrilled about 
the great work that has been done over 
many months to craft spending bills 
that lift up the ideals of our country 
and put the needs of workers and fami-
lies ahead of the desires of special in-
terests. 
As chair of the Interior and Environ-
ment Subcommittee, I can say that 
this is certainly true for the Interior 
bill that Senator MURKOWSKI and I, 
along 
with 
members 
of 
the 
sub-
committee, have worked so hard to cre-
ate. 
And I want to especially thank Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI and our fellow sub-
committee members for their contribu-
tions to this bill. 
The Interior bill raises some of the 
more complex and challenging issues 
facing America, so we are delighted 
that it has been filed today. 
Together, we have crafted a bill that 
recognizes not only the danger that 
hotter, 
more 
devastating 
wildfires, 
longer fire seasons themselves pose, 
but the dangers of smoke from them. 
That smoke is making a bigger and 
bigger impact back home on our crops 
and on our entertainment because of 
outdoor venues being shut down and 
certainly upon people’s health. The bill 
makes critical investments to lessen 
the peril. 
It doubles the funding for hazardous 
fuels reductions. When you hear that 
term, you may not be sure what it 
means. What we are talking about is 
the buildup of fuels in the forest that 
make the wildfires so much worse. So 
it doubles the funding to take out 
those fuels to $360 million so the Forest 
Service can treat more of the highest 
risk acres of forest lands. 
We particularly want to see a con-
centration of the wild land-urban inter-
face so that the fires are slowed down 
and can be attacked more aggressively 
when they are close to our towns. 
I will never forget the Labor Day 
fires of a year ago, where I drove 600 
miles up and down our State and never 
got out of the smoke, and town after 
town after town was burned to the 
ground. 
This is why we have to invest in re-
ducing the fuels in our forest and mak-
ing them more fire resilient. 
The bill doubles the funding for the 
Collaborative Forest Landscape Res-
toration program to $80 million instead 
of $40 million to help fund critical 
projects that will improve forest land-
scapes and add to the resiliency while 
also removing limitations on how 
many projects could be in each region 
each year. 
You know, the thing about these 
landscape 
restoration 
programs, 
it 
brings together the stakeholders from 
the entire spectrum—from the timber 
companies, the environmental groups, 
the local elected officials, the Indian 
Tribes—to work out a prescription on 
how to treat the forest, and then that 
treatment stays out of the courts. 
So it brings an end to the timber 
wars that have so often frustrated so 
many on all sides while thereby being 
successful in treating the forests, pro-
ducing more saw logs for the mill, pro-
ducing more jobs in the forests, more 
jobs in the log trucks. So it is a win for 
fire resiliency; it is a win for jobs; it is 
a win for our timber industry. 
Funding in this bill goes a long way 
to transitioning to a larger, permanent 
forest 
fighting—firefighting 
force 
where firefighters risking their lives 
now get a minimum pay of at least $15 
per hour. And that doesn’t sound like 
very much, but it is an elevation from 
the minimum wages of the past.

And it provides $10 million to create 
a new EPA grant program to help 
States, Tribes, local governments, and 
others prepare for and protect against 
the hazards of wildfire smoke. 
In recent years, whether it is the im-
pact of air quality on those with 
breathing and health issues or the 
tourism industry or industries like our 
wineries and our vineyards, the smoke 
that can blanket Oregon from fires dur-
ing fire season has been nearly as dev-
astating as the fires themselves. 
Our subcommittee has also crafted a 
bill that takes on the climate crisis 
with the seriousness it deserves while 
we are striving to preserve our lands 
and our natural wonders. There is no 
question the planet is getting warmer. 
Our oceans are getting more acidic as 
carbon dioxide is transformed into car-
bonic acid. That is having a big impact 
on our ecosystems on the Oregon coast. 
We are facing more extreme weather— 
droughts, 
storms, 
flooding, 
heat 
waves—but for too long, we haven’t 
come anywhere close to doing enough 
to confront this crisis. 
We are starting to make changes 
through the Interior appropriations 
bill. The bill makes major investments 
in EPA’s climate and enforcement pro-
grams, including a 46-percent increase 
in the clean air and climate program to 
tackle the crisis, restore clean air ca-
pacity, and expand and modernize air 
quality monitoring. And it provides an 
extra $56 million for the Agency’s en-
forcement and compliance efforts and 
over $40 million for the Climate Con-
servation Corps that will create jobs 
while jump-starting efforts to dramati-
cally expand on-the-ground conserva-
tion work to address the impacts of cli-
mate change; conserve and restore pub-
lic lands and public waters; bolster re-
silience, increase reforestation, protect 
biodiversity, and improve access to 
recreation. 
There is also $73 million in new fund-
ing 
to 
the 
start 
the 
process 
of 
transitioning the Interior Department 
from fossil fuel vehicles to zero-emis-
sion vehicles. It is something that has 
to happen across our entire govern-
ment. 
Finally, we have worked together to 
craft a bill that makes unprecedented, 
long overdue investments in Tribal 
communities, in their health systems, 
their education systems, social serv-
ices, water resources and infrastruc-
ture, and in law enforcement. For far 
too 
long, 
our 
Tribal 
communities 
haven’t received the help or the invest-
ments that they deserve. In this bill, 
we are starting to right that wrong. 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs is get-
ting a 15-percent increase in funding. 
The Indian Health Service is getting a 
21-percent increase in funding. And for 
the first time, the Indian Health Serv-
ice is getting an advance appropria-
tions status. What that means is if the 
government shuts down, we don’t shut 
down the health services for Native 
Americans. When that happened in the 
past, that was an egregious failure. 
You can’t let that happen. This bill 
puts an end to that, creating peace of 
mind for everyone that the health serv-
ice will be there when needed. 
We are increasing the Bureau of In-
dian Education budget by 8 percent, 
the Native American and Alaska Na-
tives housing programs by 18 percent. 
We certainly can’t make up for cen-
turies’ worth of disastrous policy and 
chronic underfunding when it comes to 
Indian Country overnight, but I believe 
this bill and its unprecedented invest-
ments should begin to make a large 
stride toward fulfilling the govern-
ment’s treaty and trust responsibil-
ities, showing Tribal communities that 
their needs are a priority. 
There is a lot more in this bill. The 
Interior appropriations bill covers a lot 
of territory. But I wanted to come to 
the floor to share some of these high-
lights. 
It is important that we get our fund-
ing bills for fiscal year 2022 to this 
floor, to the President’s desk, and take 
all the expertise that has gone into 
these bills into action by bills that 
have passed and been implemented. 
I want to provide a sense for all my 
colleagues that the real investments 
that these bills are making in our Na-
tion are the kind of investments we 
need to make to ensure strong founda-
tions for families, for our communities, 
and for our Nation to thrive in the 
years ahead. 
I am grateful for the countless hours 
of hard work from the Members and, 
very importantly, from the staff who 
put these bills together, raising the sa-
lient issues, helping to communicate 
between the Republican side and the 
Democratic side and the House side and 
the Senate side and the expertise from 
the executive branch. The staff work 
that goes into a bill like this is enor-
mous. So thank you to the staff teams 
on both the majority and minority 
side, without whom this bill would not 
exist. 
On my team, we have Melissa Zim-
merman, Ryan Hunt, Anthony Sedillo, 
and Martha Roberts. And on Ranking 
Member MURKOWSKI’s team, we have 
Emy Lesofski, Nona McCoy, and Lucas 
Agnew. To each and every one of them, 
thank you for your tireless efforts. And 
I must say that the Republican and 
Democratic team members worked so 
well together on complex and difficult 
issues involved in the Interior bill. So 
I salute them for forging that effort to 
have a very professional analysis and 
attitude as we work to solve the chal-
lenges facing America. 
I look forward to joining with all my 
colleagues in the Chamber in passing 
this bill and the other appropriations 
bills that will put America on a path to 
a much better future. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
rise today to take a step back really 
and evaluate the real-life impacts of 
President Biden’s policies. As every in-
coming administration does, promises 
were made to the American people. 
That is not surprising. But one of 
President Biden’s first promises was to 
unite the American people. But as we 
have seen too often here, he has chosen 
a path that follows the lead of the 
Democratic leadership of the House 
and Senate, which is really a solitary 
path instead of a path of unity. 
So it is fair to ask: Has that agenda 
resulted in a better life for working 
families? Has it made us more pros-
perous, more secure? Has it made us 
safer? 
Well, let’s take a look. We can start 
with what is top of mind for all of our 
folks across the country, and that is 
the rising price of everyday goods and 
services. Every day, men and women go 
to work, take the kids to school, ex-
pecting the predictability that filling 
up their car will cost a certain amount 
or that trip to the grocery store will be 
in the same range. And what do they 
find? Well, thanks to inflation, fueled 
in part by excessive government spend-
ing to the tune of trillions of dollars— 
and I am afraid we haven’t seen the end 
of it—Americans are paying higher 
prices for many of the things they just 
can’t do without. Over the past year, 
consumer prices have risen 5.4 percent, 
the largest 1-year jump in 13 years. 
So if you are saving up to buy a new 
or used car or truck, keep saving be-
cause it costs more under President 
Biden. Headed out to the grocery store? 
Prepare to see larger numbers at the 
bottom of your receipt, thanks to 
President Biden. Making monthly rent 
payments? If it seems higher than last 
year, that is because it is. The national 
median rent went up 17 percent since 
President Biden took office. Well, 
those numbers don’t lie. People see 
them every day and they are in their 
bank accounts and in their checkbooks 
and in the strain of trying to make 
those things work. These are the real- 
life consequences of misguided eco-
nomic policies from the left. Unfortu-
nately, for working-class Americans, it 
means the only thing we have built 
back better is the return to soaring in-
flation and economic misery that many 
of us remember from the Jimmy Carter 
years. 
Those years also remind us of an-
other problem facing every family, as I 
mentioned before. That is the rising 
cost of gas. Digits on the gas pump— 
they tick up faster and faster every 
time you fill up, and it isn’t because 
our tanks have gotten bigger, that is 
for sure. In West Virginia, the average 
cost of gas compared to this time last 
year is more than $1 per gallon. So not 
only are those trips to the grocery 
store more expensive, it costs more to 
get to the grocery store. The White 
House has insisted that they are work-
ing on it, and on behalf of everyone in 
my State who drives to work, drops 
their kids off at school, and hops in the 
car to visit their families, I sure hope 
they are. 
At the same time, it is important to 
note that on President Biden’s first

October 20, 2021 
day of office, he told us all we needed 
to know about his energy policy and 
that would be: America last. One of his 
first acts as President was to cancel 
the Keystone XL Pipeline, costing 
thousands of American jobs—union 
jobs—claiming that it had to be done 
to combat climate change. Compare 
that to just a few months later, when 
President Biden lifted sanctions—yes, 
he lifted the sanctions—on a Russian 
gas pipeline, allowing the Nord Stream 
II project to continue, further empow-
ering Vladimir Putin and threatening 
the national security of America and 
our allies in Europe. 
These are just a few of the backward 
moves by this White House that have 
left us really scratching our heads. And 
it has only been compounded by Execu-
tive action and regulations aimed at 
stifling the production of energy here 
in this country. We remember the ef-
fects—I certainly do in West Virginia— 
the effects of this playbook as it origi-
nally was created during the Obama 
years. So it is just a shame that this 
administration doesn’t remember that. 
Again, all of this is hitting the con-
sumer—American 
consumer—hard 
right as we are approaching our winter 
months. It is expected that households 
will see their home heating bills rise 54 
percent compared to last winter. And 
for homes that use natural gas for 
heat, which I do in my home and I 
would highly recommend it, they will 
pay about 30 percent more than they 
did last year. Families are having to 
cut back basic necessities just to heat 
their homes and make ends meet. 
Another pledge President Biden made 
was to build a fair and humane immi-
gration system. He gutted many of the 
deterrent policies that effectively kept 
illegal immigration numbers down, 
such as eliminating the effective ‘‘Re-
main in Mexico’’ policy; stopping con-
struction of the border wall; and sig-
naling to the whole hemisphere that if 
you make it to the U.S.-Mexican bor-
der, you will be allowed in. 
This was reported today, and this has 
resulted in the highest numbers for a 
fiscal year that have ever been re-
corded of border arrests—1.7 million 
border 
arrests—the 
most 
ever 
on 
record. And again, these policies were 
all done in the name of creating a 
moral and humane system. 
Well, let me tell you, the Senator 
from Missouri and I took a visit to the 
border just over the last year, and 
there was nothing humane about the 
conditions we saw with overcrowded 
migrant children facilities in Texas. 
There was nothing humane about the 
Haitian immigrants living under a 
bridge in Del Rio. There is nothing hu-
mane about women giving birth, and I 
believe at last count it was 11 children 
were born in those conditions. This all 
happened because they made that dan-
gerous journey to the border believing 
that if they made it, they would be 
welcomed in. Well, guess what. They 
were right because about 12,000 of the 
Haitian refugees that were under that 
bridge are in this country right now. 
I will take it a step further. There is 
nothing humane about fueling the dis-
ease of addiction millions of Americans 
battle as deadly drugs flow across our 
porous border and make their way into 
our communities. Not addressing an 
overdose crisis that took 93,000 sons, 
daughters, mothers, and fathers last 
year is not humane. You would say: 
How is this happening? The Border Pa-
trol has got to focus on the human ele-
ment while more and more drugs can 
pass through. 
As someone representing a State hit 
hardest by the drug epidemic, I am 
pleading with President Biden and Vice 
President HARRIS
or whoever is in 
charge of resolving the self-created 
border crisis to please do something 
different—or at least do something. 
So this is what the first year of 
Biden’s America looks like: failed poli-
cies, broken promises. Americans were 
promised prosperity, and we have got-
ten a sampling of socialism. We were 
promised a secure nation; instead, our 
borders are open and a humanitarian 
crisis rages on our southern border. We 
were promised a repaired reputation on 
the world stage, and instead we have 
led from behind and abandoned our own 
people abroad in Afghanistan. We were 
promised unity, and instead we heard 
divisive rhetoric that demonizes half of 
our country. 
The better version of America Presi-
dent Biden was selling, as some of us 
had feared, was just too good to be 
true. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Well, Madam President, 
in just a few short months this year, 
we have seen a long list of problems de-
velop in the country. Some of them my 
good friend the Senator from West Vir-
ginia just talked about. They range 
from inflation and debt to the hiring 
crisis, major disruptions in the supply 
chain. 
When I was home in Missouri last 
week meeting with all kinds of employ-
ers and all kinds of businesses, big and 
small, everybody said: We can’t find 
workers; we can’t get the supplies we 
need; and we can’t keep up with infla-
tion. 
What is astonishing to me is the 
Democrats continue to move forward 
with their $3.5 trillion reckless tax- 
and-spending spree. And, you know, it 
is easy to take that number and just 
reduce the length of time you are going 
to try out all these new policies, and 
we are going to have to talk about that 
because that is going to be a big mis-
take. 
In fact, the $3.5 trillion reckless tax- 
and-spending spree, I think, easily—if 
you extend all of the policies through 
the whole 10 years—becomes a $5 tril-
lion reckless tax-and-spending spree. If 
you reduce the policies, it is pretty 
easy to get it to $2 trillion. 
But if you reduce the policies by just 
saying, ‘‘Instead of 10 years, we are 
going to have this policy for 3 years; 
instead of 5 years, we are going to have 
this policy for 1 year,’’ all you have 
done is put future Congresses in a place 
where, frankly, Democrats would hope 
they can’t say no. 
After a year of the program, they 
can’t say no to the second year of the 
program; or after 3 years of the pro-
gram, they can’t say no. I wouldn’t 
take a whole lot of solace in the idea 
that we are going to reduce the number 
unless we look at the policies behind 
the number. 
Now, some of my colleagues and 
some of our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle—the side of the aisle 
that the Presiding Officer will be sit-
ting on now, the majority side of the 
aisle—have jumped headlong into this 
for the most part, but some of our col-
leagues have really raised some impor-
tant questions. 
For instance, one Senator said re-
cently that expanding social programs 
while ignoring the millions of open 
jobs—this is that Senator’s quote— 
‘‘will only feed a dysfunction that 
could weaken our economic recovery.’’ 
And, of course, that is exactly right. 
Businesses across the country are try-
ing to hire workers for the more than 
10 million job openings. Half the small 
businesses say they have jobs that they 
are struggling to fill—one-half of all 
small businesses. 
I was in Farmington, MO, one day 
last week, and somebody at that round-
table said: I used to say we need to do 
whatever it takes to get skilled labor, 
and then occasionally I would say we 
need to do whatever it takes to get 
part-time labor. Now I am saying we 
need to do whatever it takes to get 
labor. 
Because they can’t fill the jobs they 
have. 
What I was hearing all over our 
State, and I think every Senator in 
this body is hearing the same thing, 
which is that people can’t find the peo-
ple they need to do the work. Part of 
the reason that there are empty store 
shelves is you can’t get people to keep 
those store shelves stocked, but part of 
the reason is that they can’t get things 
to the stores to put on the shelves. 
Everything from shipyards to truck-
ing routes, to supply chains aren’t 
working the way they should right 
now, and, largely, it is because they 
don’t have the help they need to have. 
Now, I am all for looking at our long- 
term supply chain needs, bringing 
things closer to our shores when we can 
do that, but that is not the problem 
right now. The problem right now is we 
can’t get the things that come to our 
country to the places that they need to 
go, nor the things that are made in our 
country to the places they need to go. 
Businesses are trying to keep up with 
worker demand, but worker shortage is 
making that impossible. Expanding 
and creating government pay—govern-
ment handouts, I think, was what one 
of our colleagues on the Democratic 
side had referred to them as—if they 
are not connected to need or to work

October 20, 2021 
doesn’t make sense. We all want to 
help people who are in need, but we all 
want to do that in a rational way. 
Another Democratic Senator pointed 
out the danger of all this extra govern-
ment spending the President wants is 
going to really drive up inflation. And 
that is also correct. You can’t put hun-
dreds of billions of dollars into the 
economy and not have that drive up in-
flation. 
If people have money that they 
wouldn’t have otherwise, particularly 
money we had to borrow to get there or 
money we had to take out of the func-
tioning economy to get there, that 
money gets spent, but not in the way 
that you would want it to be spent to 
grow an economy and do the best 
things for individuals and families. 
The big spending spree really began 
in March with a partisan—a totally 
partisan, one-side-of-the-aisle only—$2 
trillion so-called COVID–19 relief law. 
But, frankly, it was a recovery plan 
when a recovery was well underway. I 
think the recovery plan slowed down 
the recovery and made it less likely 
that people would get back to work. It 
made it more likely that people would 
have 
money 
to 
spend 
that 
they 
wouldn’t have otherwise and drive in-
flation. 
The expert opinion of economists on 
both sides of the aisle, who said that 
what was done in March of this year 
would assure inflation would rise, it is 
exactly the same thing they are saying 
about the bill that is being debated 
right now. It has already happened, and 
it is happening. Americans are paying 
more for everything from groceries to 
gasoline, to a big purchases, like a new 
car, or even a used car is selling at a 
new sudden premium. 
Consumer prices have jumped 5.4 per-
cent from 1 year ago. That is not the 
kind of thing that does anything to 
help families. In fact, according to 
Moody’s Analytics, a family earning an 
average income of about $70,000 is 
spending an extra $175 a month on food, 
fuel, and housing because of what that 
article referred to as President Biden’s 
inflation. 
The White House Chief of Staff the 
other day, when I asked about infla-
tion, said: Well, inflation was really a 
‘‘high class problem.’’ 
I am not exactly sure what a high 
class problem means. If it means it is a 
big problem, that is right. If it means 
as I think it means, it is a problem 
that only wealthy Americans have to 
deal with, that couldn’t be right. It is 
not an upper-class problem or a high- 
income problem. It is a problem that 
hits low-income households the hard-
est. 
In the University of Michigan’s latest 
survey of consumers said that only 70 
percent of the people in that survey— 
that consumer survey, only 30 percent 
of people expect to be financially bet-
ter off next year than they are right 
now. Seventy percent thought they 
would either be worse off or not make 
any gains at all. 
That is not what we were seeing in 
2018 and 2019 under the other tax poli-
cies where, for the first time in a cou-
ple of decades, the distribution of new 
income was strong at the lowest levels 
of working families. 
The Democratic response is: Let’s 
raise taxes. Let’s spend trillions of dol-
lars. Let’s pile up more debt. 
Or that one theory: No, it won’t cost 
anything because we are paying for it. 
Well, obviously, if you are paying for 
it, it had to cost something. 
And how are you paying for it? 
You are paying for it by taking 
things out of the economy in one hand 
and shoving them back into the econ-
omy with another. 
At one point, one of our friends on 
the other side of the aisle expressed his 
opinion, as he put it, that ‘‘any expan-
sion of social programs must be tar-
geted to those in need and not ex-
panded beyond what is fiscally pos-
sible.’’ 
That is, of course, the right position. 
All of us want to help people in need, 
but we don’t want to expand that group 
beyond what you can fiscally deal with 
and not harm their own opportunities 
in the economy. 
This reckless tax-and-spending spree 
includes a number of ways on how to 
expand social welfare programs and to 
cover people with high incomes. They 
are trying to create permanent, ex-
panded subsidies for ObamaCare insur-
ance plans. Now, we clearly have sub-
sidies. They are clearly permanent. 
They are clearly substantial. But the 
bill wants to not only make the sub-
sidies higher, but it wants them to be 
higher for more people who have higher 
incomes to start with. 
They are also talking about tuition- 
free community college. Well, there is 
almost no community college in Amer-
ica today that is not already tuition- 
free for those people who we have de-
cided are in the greatest need. That is 
what Pell grants are all about. 
There is no community college in 
Missouri, and few community colleges 
anywhere in the country, where the 
full Pell grant doesn’t pay all tuition, 
all books, and all fees with a little 
money left over to travel back and 
forth to the campus. 
I am a big supporter of Pell grants. I 
worked a few years ago to go back to 
where we have year-round Pell grants. 
So if you are going to school and some-
thing is working for you, you can stay 
in school. You don’t have to take a 
summer off and get a different job and 
then think you are coming back in the 
fall to find out that that just didn’t 
work out. 
We have solved this problem. If we 
haven’t solved it adequately, well, let’s 
increase the Pell grant amount. And if 
that doesn’t do the job, why don’t we 
increase the amount of family income 
you can have and still qualify for the 
maximum Pell grant or some other 
portion of the Pell grant? 
There is an obvious solution here. As 
a matter of fact, in the markup of the 
Labor-HHS bill, I think we added $400 
to the annual Pell grant this year, 
which is a pretty substantial increase 
in that grant. The government already 
spends more than $28 billion every year 
for Pell grants. 
If you really want to make higher 
education expensive, make it free. Go 
to every higher education institution 
in America, starting with community 
colleges, and say: We are going to 
make this free. 
I was a university president for 4 
years, and we have all seen what hap-
pens as we increased the government 
support for higher education. 
I was the first person in my family to 
graduate from college. I am a big advo-
cate for higher education, but every-
body needs to have a stake in the 
game. You value what you pay for. You 
value what you have a commitment to. 
Free usually doesn’t get you where you 
want to get. We don’t want to dupli-
cate what we are already doing, and we 
don’t want to create free programs for 
people who don’t need free programs. 
Finally, obviously, a lot of emphasis 
and unease on these tax increases. One 
of my colleagues on the other side said 
our Tax Code ‘‘should not weaken our 
global competitiveness or the ability of 
millions of small businesses to com-
pete.’’ 
That is undeniably true. 
The 2017 Republican-led tax law fol-
lowed a consensus that we need to 
bring the U.S. in line with our global 
competitors. Let’s not get out of line 
and make it harder for us to compete. 
We were on an incredible trajectory of 
job creation and pay for all of the 
working-class families that had been 
left out of the system for too long. We 
could easily wipe out those gains with 
a corporate tax rate increase that loses 
our competitive advantage to people 
who we don’t want to lose it to. 
Democrats are also aiming several of 
their tax hikes at small businesses and 
family farms. They plan to hike, we 
hear, those taxes by 57 percent of the 
top marginal rate, from 29.6 to 46.4. 
There are a lot of concerns with the 
legislation that President Biden and 
his allies in Congress are trying to 
push through. 
The American economy is struggling 
against the headwinds of an, frankly, 
administration that has done so much 
to create on its own. This terrible leg-
islation would just make everything 
worse. Let’s not work on one side only 
to make everything worse. Let’s see 
what we can do to work together to 
make everything better. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
so appreciate the remarks of my col-
league from Missouri, and it sounds as 
if he is hearing from his constituents 
in Missouri the same thing that I am 
hearing in Tennessee.

East Tennessee were on this call, and 
to say that they are unhappy would be 
to put it mildly. That really is an un-
derstatement. They are angry. They 
are frustrated. They are exhausted 
with what this administration is doing. 
They are angry with how the Federal 
Government is responding to a host of 
issues. 
They really took President Biden at 
his word for his Build Back Better. 
They expected that. But that is not 
what they have gotten. He has made a 
mess of it, and, indeed, what you have 
is a ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ agenda. 
And my colleague from Missouri 
really laid that out. It is ‘‘Build Back 
Broke.’’ That is what they are bringing 
forward. And that agenda of President 
Biden’s and the Democratic Party has 
really destroyed a lot of the hopes and 
the dreams and some of the renewed 
prosperity of Tennesseans whose job 
isn’t to study the economy but to move 
it forward. 
They do the heavy lift every single 
day. 
Last 
night, 
I 
spoke 
with 
businessowners who feel like they are 
under attack by this administration 
and their economic policy. The cost of 
doing business is going up. They are 
bleeding customers because they have 
less disposable income because of infla-
tion, because of the price at the pump. 
Supply chains are collapsing around 
them. It is difficult to get raw mate-
rials, like lumber and steel. They have 
no confidence at all in the administra-
tion’s willingness or ability to solve 
this problem. They feel as if the admin-
istration does not give the ripping flip 
about what happens to them in Upper 
East Tennessee. This administration 
has forgotten them. 
On top of everything else, these vac-
cine mandates—now, we are hearing a 
lot about that, and we are hearing from 
people who know they are going to lose 
their job. Many times, these are women 
who are the sole source—the sole 
source—of income for their families. 
These families are very concerned 
about how they are going to handle in-
flation, collapsing supply lines, how 
they are going to handle some of the 
broken social policies that this admin-
istration and their allies are trying to 
sneak into law. 
So far this year, we have seen our 
colleagues across the aisle and down at 
the White House try to force through 
provisions of the Green New Deal that 
would bankrupt your average family 
and destroy economic development op-
portunities in rural areas. 
We know that it is expected that the 
cost to heat your home this winter is 
going to increase 30 percent. Now, how 
do you handle that when you have lost 
your job? Do you just sit there and 
freeze? And you are losing your job be-
cause of a Federal mandate that says 
you have to go get a shot in order to 
keep a job that you love, in order to 
put food on the table to feed your fam-
ily. This makes no sense. 
I also heard from parents very upset 
about critical race theory and the way 
this administration is trying to hijack 
education and force this curriculum, 
force cradle-to-grave socialism—day-
light to dark, 24/7, depend on the Fed-
eral Government. 
One of the things that frightens Ten-
nesseans the most and came up regu-
larly on our telephone townhall was 
the broken border policies. I have said 
it before; I will say it again. This fear 
has nothing to do with racism and xen-
ophobia. This administration and my 
colleagues across the aisle need to get 
that point through their heads. 
Tennesseans are afraid because they 
look at the border. What they are see-
ing is vulnerability. They see the drugs 
coming across that border because the 
drugs end up in their streets: fentanyl, 
meth, heroin. 
Every town is a border town. Every 
State is a border State because Joe 
Biden’s border policy is: Open up the 
border. Hang out the ‘‘Y’all come 
sign,’’ and give everybody a plane tick-
et to wherever they are going in the 
country. And, oh, by the way, if the 
commercial 
flights 
are 
full, 
don’t 
worry about it. We will go charter you 
a jet and send you under the cloak of 
darkness into Chattanooga or into 
Knoxville or into West Chester County. 
That is what concerns Tennesseans. 
They are seeing what is happening 
with sex trafficking, with human traf-
ficking. They are afraid of what cartels 
are doing because the cartels are say-
ing: Thank you, Joe Biden. The door is 
open. We were not fearful. We are set-
ting up distribution centers on U.S. 
soils. 
That is right, the cartels, setting up 
their distribution centers. Why? Be-
cause Joe Biden is weak and feckless 
and doesn’t stand up to protect the 
southern border. 
There is another thing that they 
were quite exercised about last night, 
and it is the issue of election integrity. 
Indeed, I had a Tennessean call me at 
6:45 this morning, and he said: Marsha, 
you have got to be kidding me. You 
mean they want to pass a bill that says 
anybody can go vote, that you can go 
vote the day of the election, that you 
don’t have to show an ID to vote? 
He said: You know, I recently had to 
show not only a vaccine card but my 
ID to prove that was my vaccine card 
to go sit inside at the In-N-Out Burger. 
This is why people are so frustrated 
with Joe Biden. This is why they are so 
frustrated with the Democrats. 
What are they looking for? They are 
looking for legislators to have some 
backbone, to stand up and stand for 
freedom, not to kowtow to a socialist 
agenda, because they know if the 
Democratic leadership and Joe Biden 
had their way with one vote, they 
would take one vote, and they would 
push to a socialist agenda. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING MIDDLEBURY 
COLLEGE 
Mr. 
LEAHY. 
Mr. 
President, 
Middlebury College, in my State of 
Vermont, is known worldwide as an 
outstanding 
educational 
institution. 
What is less well-known is that the col-
lege is also a leader in addressing cli-
mate change. 
The college first became carbon neu-
tral not by simply purchasing carbon 
credits, but by doing the hard work of 
actually becoming carbon neutral, in-
cluding the implementation of 123 indi-
vidual efficiency projects that are col-
lectively saving the college nearly $1 
million a year. With that work com-
plete, they set about securing their en-
ergy entirely from renewable sources— 
first, with one of the largest bio-
digesters in Vermont and, now, with a 
5 megawatt solar array, that will pro-
vide 30 percent of the college’s elec-
tricity. 
The project includes energy storage, 
which will benefit the electric grid by 
spreading out when the power enters 
the grid. Perhaps more importantly, 
that stored energy will also serve as a 
source of emergency power for a nearby 
hospital, Porter Medical Center. The 
project also involves two Vermont 
companies: 
Encore 
Renewable 
and 
Green Mountain Power. 
Earlier this month, it was an honor 
to join the groundbreaking for the 
project, 
where 
Middlebury 
College 
President Laurie Patton shared her vi-
sion for how to get to a better climate 
future. All should read her impressive 
remarks at the event, and I ask that a 
copy of them be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7122 
October 20, 2021 
October 12, 2021. 
Good morning. 
I am so happy to be here with you today, 
and it’s my honor to share this podium on a 
beautiful autumn morning with my friends 
and colleagues Chief Don Stephens, Senator 
Patrick Leahy, Chad Farrell of Encore Re-
newable Energy, Matt Murphy of Green 
Backer Capital, Mari McClure of Green 
Mountain Power, Lieutenant Governor Molly 
Gray, Middlebury Select board chairman 
Brian Carpenter, and the College’s own 
Simone Ameer. Senator Leahy, as a pro-
fessor of religion I already made arrange-
ments with the heavens for this weather—so 
you didn’t need to make the law! 
We come together today as responsible 
stewards of this planet and of this place we 
are blessed to call home—Ndakinna [in-DAH- 
keen-AH], the town of Middlebury, the coun-
ty of Addison, the state of Vermont. 
We gather to recognize the generations 
who came before us in making this very 
place what it is today, and we do so in serv-
ice of the generations to come, to ensure 
that 
Ndakinna 
[in-DAH-keen-AH], 
Middlebury, Addison County, and Vermont 
remain places where the health of our envi-
ronment is paramount, and where our people 
can come together in concert, rather than 
competition, to maintain a livable commu-
nity and planet. 
When we at Middlebury announced our En-
ergy 2028 initiative three years ago, we laid 
out an ambitious ten-year plan, pledging 
that in a decade’s time we would sharply re-
duce our energy consumption as an institu-
tion; reduce and then eliminate our invest-
ment in fossil fuels; craft a large educational 
initiative to continue our research and 
scholarship into climate change—and, in per-
haps our boldest promise, rely completely on 
renewable energy sources to power our 
Vermont campus. 
The solar array project on which we break 
ground today takes us one large step closer 
to realizing this goal, as it is expected to 
provide nearly one-third of the energy need-
ed 
to 
power 
our 
campus. 
This 
groundbreaking comes on the heels of the 
start-up of the largest anaerobic digester in 
the Northeastern United States at the Good-
rich Farm in nearby Salisbury, another local 
project and partnership that is supplying re-
newable natural gas to the College and com-
munity. 
Each of these efforts—indeed, all of our ef-
forts to meet our Energy 2028 goals—are col-
laborative by design, because we all have a 
stake in the outcome. Just as our plan was 
crafted in a spirit of independence, in which 
no individual part could work without the 
other, the same can be said for our partner-
ships. Remove any one of us, and we’re not 
here today. Remove any one of us, and we’re 
not here today. 
In a few weeks, on a platform a little bit 
bigger than this one and with just a few 
more people in attendance, the United Na-
tions Climate Change Conference will con-
vene in Glasgow, Scotland. The comparisons 
in scope between that and this, here and 
there, may cause some to peer at us today 
and wonder: what’s the point? We’re so 
small! 
As I have written and spoken in the past, 
a local initiative such as this one is exactly 
the point, the point being that local wisdom 
and local practices are the ideal conditions 
to help put out the fire that is consuming 
our planet. The sun is one of the oldest sym-
bols known to humans; it is in the earliest 
cave paintings tens of thousands of years 
ago, and in the earliest spoken prayers of 
more than 3000 years ago. It is only fitting 
that we should return, indeed come full cir-
cle, to the sun to heal our planet. 
We are so blessed to call this place home. 
The Green Mountains rest behind me. 
In my mind’s eye, I can already envision 
the sheep that will graze beneath the solar 
arrays, managing the vegetation growing in 
these fields. 
And up above, in a sky that Sabra Field 
herself could have painted, a golden light 
will not only illuminate the beauty of our 
surroundings but will allow us to take an-
other critical step toward building a sustain-
able future. 
Thank you, everyone of you, for your help 
in building a new world. 
LAURIE L. PATTON, 
President, Middlebury.

TRIBUTE TO ADELINE DRUART 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, these 
days, it is not uncommon for people to 
frequently change careers, companies, 
or job paths. At one iconic Vermont en-
tity, though, Vermont Creamery, presi-
dent and chief executive officer Adeline 
Druart has dedicated more than 17 
years to growing and expanding the 
company’s product line and brand. She 
was recently featured on the Positive 
Enterprise Podcast, and hers is a story 
in which all Vermonters can find pride 
and motivation. 
The cheese and butter that Vermont 
Creamery produces is some of the best 
in the world. As a Certified B Corpora-
tion, Vermont Creamery follows a long 
Vermont legacy of investing in envi-
ronmental sustainability, local supply 
chains, and worker satisfaction. These 
investments have clearly paid off. In 
2017, Vermont Creamery was acquired 
by Land O’Lakes, a century-old farmer- 
owned cooperative, and has continued 
on an impressive path of conscious 
growth. With Land O’Lakes’ support, 
Vermont Creamery has expanded its fa-
cilities nearly 40 percent and is now a 
recognizable brand in grocery stores 
across the country. In 2020, the com-
pany 
supported 
our 
community 
through the pandemic, donating 12,000 
pounds of food to hungry Vermonters, 
providing hazard pay to their employ-
ees, 
and 
advocating 
for 
universal 
childcare for Vermont’s working fami-
lies. 
They 
also 
converted 
their 
Websterville-based facility to run on 
100-percent 
renewable 
energy. 
And 
these changes have only underlined 
their belief that consciously crafted 
products made with the best ingredi-
ents just taste better. Today, the be-
loved Vermont Creamery makes the 
No. 1 best-selling goat cheese in the 
country. 
Adeline Druart is responsible for so 
much of this impressive growth. In the 
early 2000s, Adeline, then a student 
from France, came to Vermont Cream-
ery to complete an internship for her 
master’s degree. She just couldn’t stay 
away. Adeline worked her way up the 
ranks at the creamery, before being 
named president and CEO in 2015. In 
that role, she has shown exactly what 
tenacity and hard work, when paired 
with a people-first approach to busi-
ness, can do. The mother of two young 
sons, Adeline has reinforced Vermont 
Creamery’s 
original 
family-oriented 
culture while steering the company’s 
growth. She is an inspiration to me, 
and I am so proud that she calls 
Vermont home. 
Vermont is home to some of the fin-
est agriculture, wood-based, and other 
products in the country. We feature 
many of these at the annual Taste of 
Vermont here in Washington, a tradi-
tion I hope to return to next year. At 
the helm of so many of these Vermont 
companies are people like Adeline. It is 
in these hard-working and creative 
leaders that we can find great hope for 
Vermont’s economic recovery and vi-
brant future.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO STEVE LEVESQUE 
∑ Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize the outstanding ca-
reer of a leader in economic develop-
ment in the State of Maine. Steve 
Levesque, of Greenville, ME, is retiring 
after 41 years of professional experi-
ence in the areas of economic and com-
munity progress, land use planning, 
and environmental services in both the 
private and public sectors, including 
when I was Governor as commissioner 
of Maine’s Department of Economic 
and Community Development. Most re-
cently, Steve has made an indelible 
mark in his position as executive direc-
tor of Midcoast Regional Redevelop-
ment Authority, MRRA. From his first 
days in economic and community de-
velopment in Maine, Steve has held a 
number 
of 
leadership 
positions 
in 
which he has led and advocated tire-
lessly for local, regional, and State 
economies with consistent messages of 
the quality of the business environ-
ment in Maine alongside our quality of 
life as Mainers. 
In 2005, there were indications that 
the Naval Air Station Brunswick, 
NASB, would be disestablished and 
Steve, at that time, led the Brunswick 
Local 
Redevelopment 
Authority, 
charged with overseeing the successful 
completion of the Reuse Master Plan 
for NASB. He has been MRRA’s only 
executive director since its formation 
in 2008. In 2011, when NASB officially 
closed, there were persistent doomsday 
forecasts about the hole that was left 
behind. Steve brought his own brand of 
fervency to MRRA to realize a dream 
of the adaptive reuse of the former 
base, now known as Brunswick Land-
ing. He started by assembling a pas-
sionate and hard-working team and 
began carefully cultivating what would 
become critical and dedicated partner-
ships, developed over the years with so 
many groups: the Navy, the towns of 
Brunswick and Topsham, the State of 
Maine, all of Maine’s congressional del-
egation, the FAA, and especially the 
impressive list of businesses and pri-
vate developers who have invested in 
the vision to convert a former Navy 
base into an economic engine that

today holds more than 2,400 jobs, sur-
passing the $150 million former Navy 
payroll. 
When you read the list of other 
benchmarks at Brunswick Landing, 
over only 10 years—the creation of 
TechPlace, a manufacturing business 
incubator with 35 resident businesses; 
attraction of over a half billion dollars 
in private sector capital investment; 
property sales to more than 20 new 
property owners, including more than 
650 units of workforce housing; more 
than $150 million in new valuation and 
$3 million in annual property taxes 
generated for the Towns of Brunswick 
and Topsham; more than $40 million in 
upgrades to Brunswick Executive Air-
port’s—BXM— 
infrastructure 
and 
buildings; more than $100 million in-
vested in new building construction 
and infrastructure projects owned by 
MRRA; creation of Brunswick Renew-
able Energy Center, including owner-
ship of former Navy electrical grid 
with 
3.5-megawatt 
load 
and 
2 
megawatts of on-site renewable elec-
tricity generation; 10 percent annual 
growth in air operations, based air-
craft, and aviation fuel sales at BXM; 
environmental stewardship and wildlife 
habitat preservation, including trans-
fer of more than 1,200 acres of open 
space and trails to the town of Bruns-
wick and local land trust—it is no won-
der Steve’s leadership has been recog-
nized, not once but twice, as a recipi-
ent of the Association of Defense Con-
tractor’s 
Community 
Leadership 
Award as well as by many other State 
development organizations. I join them 
wholeheartedly in recognizing Steve 
for demonstrating innovation and ex-
cellence in his work. 
Even in his volunteer time, Steve 
serves on a number of industry and 
economic development boards, includ-
ing the Loring Development Authority 
of Maine, Moosehead Lake Region Eco-
nomic Development Corporation, Owls 
Head Transportation Museum, and the 
Maine Spaceport Leadership Council, 
to name a few. Steve has also served 
his country in the U.S. Marine Corps as 
an aircraft mechanic. 
Due to Steve’s commitment to eco-
nomic development and ability to se-
cure funding for a variety of initiatives 
throughout the years, there has been 
continued high quality service for new 
and 
expanding 
businesses 
here 
in 
Maine. His ability to coordinate pro-
grams and foster partnerships were 
critical factors in his success, whether 
it be at the local, State, or national 
level. As a champion of economic de-
velopment, I join with his colleagues, 
friends, and the people of Maine in 
thanking Steve for his unwavering 
service to the economic development of 
our State.∑

TRIBUTE TO DEPUTY SHERIFF 
JOHN MINER 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
wish to honor and recognize a true hero 
from Phillipsburg, KS, Deputy Sheriff 
John Miner. On November 4, 2020, Dep-
uty Miner responded to an accident 
caused by a semi-truck colliding with 
multiple vehicles in Long Island, KS. 
What was already a scary situation on 
its own turned worse when fuel from 
the semi began leaking and ignited 
shortly after. 
A raging fire quickly started, and 
suddenly, bystanders realized two tod-
dlers—a 4-year-old and 2-year-old— 
were stuck in one of the cars caught in 
the 
accident. 
Without 
a 
second 
thought, Deputy Miner performed his 
duty to protect and serve by leaping 
straight into the whipping fire to res-
cue those two children. With just a 
pocketknife, 
he 
was 
able 
to 
cut 
through the seatbelts trapping them 
and pulled them out miraculously 
unharmed. Deputy Miner, however, suf-
fered second- and third-degree burns 
which required skin grafts. Thankfully, 
he has since recovered from his inju-
ries. 
This valiant story caught the atten-
tion of many in Kansas and, now, 
around the Nation, as Deputy Miner 
has been awarded the Carnegie medal 
for an extraordinary act of heroism. 
This award is bestowed on a select few 
each year for showing true bravery and 
courage in the face of danger. Deputy 
Miner is absolutely deserving of this 
award after rescuing those two chil-
dren last year from certain death. 
I want to thank this brave officer for 
being so courageous to dive headfirst 
into peril. As the son of a police chief, 
I know the risks our men and women in 
blue take on each day, and they are the 
most admirable citizens for contin-
ually working to ensure our safety. 
Deputy Miner has shown what true 
valor looks like, and Phillipsburg is 
safer because of him. I ask now that 
my colleagues show this same admira-
tion and recognition for Deputy Miner 
and that he may stay safe protecting 
his community.∑

RECOGNIZING SOUTH LEBANON 
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the designation of 
South Lebanon as an Official City in 
Ohio. In accordance with section 703.06 
of the Revised Code of the State of 
Ohio, a municipality that reaches 5,000 
residents in the State of Ohio, auto-
matically becomes a city. Since 2000, 
the municipality of South Lebanon has 
grown 151 percent and has reached a 
population of 6,384. 
The growing population of South 
Lebanon also comes with a rich his-
tory. South Lebanon is the oldest town 
in Warren County, OH, and was also 
deemed one of the most important 
towns on the Little Miami River in the 
late 1700s. In its early days of settle-
ment, it was a stopping place for many 
pioneers who were venturing across the 
country in search of a new life. Today, 
that same town that was a place of pos-
sibility and refuge to so many early 
pioneers has become a booming eco-
nomic power, bringing new jobs, good 
schools, and a strong sense of commu-
nity. 
I am proud to see South Lebanon be 
recognized for its growth and persever-
ance as it continues to expand, making 
Ohio a great place to live and work.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. WARREN (for herself, Ms. 
BALDWIN, Mr BROWN, Mr. SAND-
ERS, and Mr. MERKLEY): 
S. 3022. A bill to subject certain pri-
vate funds to joint and several liability 
with respect to the liabilities of firms 
acquired and controlled by those funds, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of legislation that 
I have recently joined Senator WARREN 
in introducing. It is called the Stop 
Wall Street Looting Act, and it con-
cerns some of the practices and the 
business model of what I would de-
scribe as predatory private equity 
firms. 
Now, before I dive into the details, I 
want to say that there are very good 
private equity companies that invest in 
the businesses they have purchased and 
the communities and the workers. 
But, unfortunately, this is something 
that I have firsthand knowledge of, the 
impact of predatory private equity 
businesses on workers and commu-
nities in my home State of Wisconsin. 
Several historic Wisconsin companies 
have been driven into bankruptcy or 
had their facilities moved overseas by 
the private equity funds and companies 
that acquired them. 
The first company that I want to 
talk about is ShopKo. For those who 
weren’t in the ShopKo footprint in the 
United States, ShopKo is a retailer 
that 
was 
founded 
in 
1961 
in 
Ashwaubenon, WI. ShopKo was bought 
by a private equity firm, after many 
profitable years of existence, back in 
2005. The firm was Sun Capital Part-
ners. 
Sun Capital immediately executed 
what is known as a sale-leaseback. A 
sale-leaseback is a textbook private eq-
uity maneuver in which the fund sells 
the company’s real estate right out 
from under it. Real estate and the fa-
cilities were the most major asset that 
ShopKo had. 
Certainly, they also had inventory 
and workers, but they owned the real 
estate, and this private equity firm ba-
sically sold ShopKo’s 351 locations with 
hundreds of millions of dollars, and 
they were sold to a company that 
would lease the land and buildings 
back to ShopKo. 
Sun Capital promised to reinvest the 
proceeds of the sale back into the com-
pany, but instead it paid out cash to 
itself in the form of dividends and man-
agement fees. Not only was ShopKo 
prevented from using its cash to rein-
vest, it was also loaded up with $200 
million more in additional debt to fund 
even more payouts to Sun Capital ex-
ecutives. 
After years of being starved of in-
vestment, ShopKo was forced into 
bankruptcy and liquidation in 2019. The 
3,000 Wisconsin workers were promised 
severance pay in exchange for working 
through the company’s final days. 
I mean, if you think about that, you 
have a retail store. You don’t want ev-
erybody to—the day they find out that 
store is ultimately going to close—to 
go out and find other jobs or you don’t 
have the way to wind down your busi-
ness. So they were promised severance 
pay in exchange for working through 
the company’s final days. But when the 
time came to pay the workers, Sun 
Capital said it didn’t have any money. 
When I met with these ShopKo work-
ers, I remember meeting Kristi Van 
Beckum. She said to me: 
I always felt proud to work at ShopKo be-
cause it was a Wisconsin-based company and 
it invested a lot in the community. But I saw 
how Sun Capital sold out ShopKo’s prop-
erties and [literally] destroyed the company, 
all for their own benefit. They made millions 
while I didn’t even get the severance I was 
promised. Sun Capital ran a company we 
loved into the ground. 
More recently, I visited with workers 
at Hufcor, a company that has oper-
ated in Janesville, WI, for over 120 
years. In 2017, the manufacturer was 
acquired by a private equity firm 
called OpenGate Capital. 
Wisconsinites are sadly already fa-
miliar with OpenGate. This is an L.A.- 
based private equity fund that bank-
rupted another Wisconsin firm, Golden 
Guernsey Dairy, back in 2013, only 2 
years after acquiring it, laying off hun-
dreds of workers in Waukesha, WI. 
Dairy workers showed up one day to 
find the doors locked. They were given 
no notice of their layoff, and they had 
to fight OpenGate for 8 years just to 
get their back pay. 
This past summer, OpenGate notified 
the 166 workers at Hufcor that their 
jobs would be terminated, and the 
workers soon learned that the manu-
facturing operations would be moved to 
Monterrey, Mexico. 
When I visited with the workers this 
summer, I learned this from Michelle, 
who had worked for Hufcor for 23 years. 
She told me she is anxious about what 
training she might need to get another 
job that will pay what she earned at 
Hufcor. 
Then I also heard from Jesse. He was 
diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago, and 
he depends upon the health benefit pro-
vided by Hufcor for his treatment. 
These workers had great benefits be-
cause of their representation by the 
Communications Workers of America 
union and because of their employment 
at Hufcor, but they were left with an 
uncertain future because OpenGate has 
decided to move their jobs to Mexico. 
These stories illustrate the devasta-
tion that the predatory private equity 
business model has wrought on my 
State. These workers deserve better. 
We need to rip up private equity’s pred-
atory playbook that enriches looters, 
but leaves workers with nothing but 
pink slips. 
I was proud to work with Senator 
WARREN to introduce the aptly named 
Stop Wall Street Looting Act. This leg-
islation will prevent private equity 
firms from enriching themselves by 
starving businesses of investment and 
running them into bankruptcy or ship-
ping their jobs overseas. This bold re-
form will help rewrite the rules of our 
economy and protect workers from the 
predatory practices so that we can 
start to reward hard work, not just 
wealth. 
Thank you for the opportunity to 
share the stories from my State, and I 
look forward to working to pass this 
important legislation.

SENATE RESOLUTION 425—RECOG-
NIZING 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
PROTECTING 
FREEDOM 
OF 
SPEECH, 
THOUGHT, 
AND 
EX-
PRESSION AT INSTITUTIONS OF 
HIGHER EDUCATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN (for herself, Mr. 
COTTON, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. LANKFORD, Mr. 
BRAUN, Mr. GRASSLEY, Ms. ERNST, Mr. 
RUBIO, Mr. HAWLEY, Mr. SCOTT
of 
South Carolina, and Mr. CRUZ) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 425 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States guarantees 
that ‘‘Congress shall make no law . . . 
abridging the freedom of speech’’; 
Whereas, in Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169 
(1972), the Supreme Court of the United 
States held that the First Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States applies in 
full force on the campuses of public colleges 
and universities; 
Whereas, in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 
(1981), the Supreme Court of the United 
States observed that ‘‘the campus of a public 
university, at least for its students, pos-
sesses many of the characteristics of a public 
forum’’; 
Whereas lower Federal courts have also 
held that the open, outdoor areas of the cam-
puses of public colleges and universities are 
public forums; 
Whereas section 112(a)(2) of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1011a(a)(2)) 
contains a sense of Congress noting that ‘‘an 
institution of higher education should facili-
tate the free and open exchange of ideas’’, 
‘‘students should not be intimidated, har-
assed, discouraged from speaking out, or dis-
criminated against’’, ‘‘students should be 
treated equally and fairly’’, and ‘‘nothing in 
this paragraph shall be construed to modify, 
change, or infringe upon any constitu-
tionally protected religious liberty, freedom, 
expression, or association’’; 
Whereas, despite the clarity of the applica-
ble legal precedent and the vital importance 
of protecting public colleges in the United 
States as true ‘‘marketplaces of ideas’’, the 
Foundation for Individual Rights in Edu-
cation has found that approximately 1 in 10 
of the top colleges and universities in the 
United States quarantine student expression 
to so-called ‘‘free speech zones’’, and a sur-
vey of 466 schools found that almost 30 per-
cent maintain severely restrictive speech 
codes that clearly and substantially prohibit 
constitutionally protected speech; 
Whereas, according to the American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU), ‘‘Speech codes 
adopted by government-financed state col-
leges and universities amount to government 
censorship, in violation of the Constitution. 
And the ACLU believes that all campuses 
should adhere to First Amendment prin-
ciples because academic freedom is a bedrock 
of education in a free society.’’; 
Whereas the University of Chicago, as part 
of its commitment ‘‘to free and open inquiry 
in all matters’’, issued a statement in which 
‘‘it guarantees all members of the University 
community the broadest possible latitude to 
speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn’’, 
and more than 50 university administrations 
and faculty bodies have endorsed a version of 
the ‘‘Chicago Statement’’; 
Whereas, in December 2014, the University 
of Hawaii at Hilo settled a lawsuit for $50,000 
after it was sued in Federal court for prohib-
iting students from protesting the National 
Security Agency unless those students were 
standing in the tiny, flood-prone free speech 
zone at the university; 
Whereas, in July 2015, California State 
Polytechnic University, Pomona, settled a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7129 
October 20, 2021 
Whereas, in June 2018, the University of 
Michigan agreed to change its restrictive 
speech code on the same day the United 
States Department of Justice filed a state-
ment of interest in support of a lawsuit in 
Federal court challenging the constitu-
tionality of the speech code of the univer-
sity; 
Whereas, in December 2018, the Los Ange-
les Community College District, a 9-campus 
community college district that includes 
Pierce College, settled a lawsuit for $225,000 
and changed its restrictive speech policies 
after it was sued in Federal court for prohib-
iting a Pierce College student from distrib-
uting Spanish-language copies of the Con-
stitution of the United States on campus un-
less he stood in the free speech zone, which 
comprised approximately 0.003 percent of the 
total area of the 426 acres of the college; 
Whereas, in December 2018, the University 
of California, Berkeley, home of the 1960s 
campus free speech movement, settled a law-
suit for $70,000 and changed its restrictive 
policies after it was sued in Federal court for 
singling out one student group, apart from 
other student groups, with the imposition of 
stricter rules for inviting ‘‘high-profile’’ pub-
lic speakers; 
Whereas the States of Virginia, Missouri, 
Arizona, Kentucky, Colorado, Utah, North 
Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, Georgia, Lou-
isiana, South Dakota, and Iowa have passed 
legislation prohibiting public colleges and 
universities from quarantining expressive 
activities on the open outdoor areas of cam-
puses to misleadingly labeled free speech 
zones; and 
Whereas free speech zones have been used 
to restrict political speech from all parts of 
the political spectrum and have thus inhib-
ited the free exchange of ideas at campuses 
across the country: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that free speech zones and 
restrictive speech codes are inherently at 
odds with the freedom of speech guaranteed 
by the First Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States; 
(2) recognizes that institutions of higher 
education should facilitate and recommit 
themselves to protecting the free and open 
exchange of ideas; 
(3) recognizes that freedom of expression 
and freedom of speech are sacred ideals of 
the United States that must be vigorously 
safeguarded in a world increasingly hostile 
to democracy; 
(4) encourages the Secretary of Education 
to promote policies that foster spirited de-
bate, academic freedom, intellectual curi-
osity, and viewpoint diversity on the cam-
puses of public colleges and universities; and 
(5) encourages the Attorney General to de-
fend and protect the First Amendment 
across public colleges and universities.

Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 2899 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2899) to require the Director of 
the Bureau of Prisons to address deficiencies 
and make necessary upgrades to the security 
camera and radio systems of the Bureau of 
Prisons to ensure the health and safety of 
employees and inmates. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and the motion to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 2899) was ordered to be 
engrossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed as follows: 
S. 2899 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Prison Cam-
era Reform Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Bureau of Prisons has 122 institu-
tions located throughout the United States. 
The Bureau of Prisons employs nearly 38,000 
employees and is responsible for more than 
150,000 Federal inmates. 
(2) Video footage from security camera 
systems and reliable communication over 
radio systems within Bureau of Prisons in-
stitutions are essential to protecting the 
health and safety of Bureau of Prisons em-
ployees and Federal inmates. 
(3) Based on the experience of Bureau of 
Prisons correctional staff, the noticeable 
presence of functioning security cameras 
serves as an effective deterrent to criminal 
behavior and misconduct. 
(4) Well-documented deficiencies of camera 
systems at Bureau of Prisons’ facilities have 
hindered investigators’ ability to substan-
tiate allegations of serious misconduct by 
staff and inmates, including sexual and phys-
ical assaults, medical neglect, and introduc-
tion of contraband. 
(5) In a 2016 report, the Office of the Inspec-
tor General for the Department of Justice 
determined that ‘‘deficiencies within the 
BOP’s security camera system have affected 
the OIG’s ability to secure prosecutions of 
staff and inmates in BOP contraband intro-
duction cases, and these same problems ad-
versely impact the availability of critical 
evidence to support administrative or dis-
ciplinary action against staff and inmates’’. 
(6) Shortcomings in the land-mobile radio 
systems at Bureau of Prison facilities insti-
tutions impede the communication abilities 
of staff, slowing or preventing the response 
of correctional officers during an emergency 
or threat of attack, and jeopardizing the 
safety of both staff and Federal inmates. 
SEC. 3. REQUIRED PLAN FOR REFORM OF BOP 
SECURITY CAMERA AND RADIO COV-
ERAGE AND CAPABILITIES. 
(a) PLAN.—Not later than 90 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Director 
of the Bureau of Prisons shall—

and public address (referred to in this Act as 
‘‘PA’’) systems in use by the Bureau of Pris-
ons as of the date of enactment of this Act; 
and 
(2) submit to the Committee on the Judici-
ary of the Senate and the Committee on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives a 
plan for ensuring that all Bureau of Prisons 
correctional facilities have the security cam-
era, LMR, and PA system coverage and capa-
bilities necessary to— 
(A) ensure the health and safety of staff 
and Federal inmates; and

bility of video evidence that may pertain to 
misconduct by staff or inmates, negligent or 
abusive treatment of inmates, or criminal 
activity within correctional facilities.

cordings such that the recordings are avail-
able to investigators or Courts at such time 
as may be reasonably required; and 
(C) additional enterprise-wide camera sys-
tem capabilities needed to enhance the safe-
ty and security of inmates and staff; 
(3) identify and include plans to address 
any deficiencies in the LMR and PA systems 
in use at Bureau of Prisons correctional fa-
cilities, including those related to— 
(A) an inadequate number of radios;

inoperable, 
outdated, 
or 
malfunc-
tioning LMR or PA systems; 
(C) areas of Bureau of Prisons correctional 
facilities that lack adequate reception for 
radio operation; 
(D) radios that lack an emergency notifica-
tion feature (also known as a ‘‘man down’’ 
function), which automatically sends an 
alert and transmits the location of that 
radio in the event the wearer is in a prone 
position; and 
(E) any other deficits in the LMR or PA 
systems; 
(4) include an assessment of operational 
and 
logistical

f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
you know, I think Americans must 
look at what is happening up here in 
Washington, DC, and think that the 
Democrats look like squirrels dodging 
cars in traffic. This is Biden’s America, 
one where the party in power is throw-
ing policy spaghetti at the wall in 
hopes that one of their harebrained 
ideas will stick. 
It would be almost funny if our coun-
try wasn’t staring down multiple prob-
lems as a result of the Biden adminis-
tration’s policy failures. And it is time 
the Democrats faced the facts. But 
after 10 months of President Biden run-
ning the country, how are ordinary 
Americans doing? 
Let’s just take a look. Take the bor-
der crisis: a complete, predictable, self- 
inflicted disaster. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden made the radical decision to 
open our borders by undoing many suc-
cessful policies put in place by the 
Trump 
administration. 
They 
were 
working, and we changed them. You 
can draw a straight line from those ill- 
advised policy decisions to where we 
are as we speak. 
Two million illegal immigrants will 
have been apprehended by the end of 
this year, and those are just the ones 
that we caught. Oddly enough, this is 
one issue that the mainstream media 
and conservative media agree on. 
Here are a few recent headlines. 
From CNN: ‘‘12,000 migrants have been 
waiting in makeshift camps under the 
Del Rio bridge in Texas.’’ That is from 
CNN. 
And this from the Daily Caller: ‘‘Mi-
grants Illegally Crossing U.S.-Mexico 
Border 
Thank’’—they 
thank—Presi-
dent ‘‘[Biden’s] Administration.’’ 
Do those headlines sound like the 
southwest border is under control? 
Here is another headline for you. In a 
remarkable about-face, the Biden ad-
ministration announced that it would 
reimplement the Trump-era Remain in 
Mexico policy after doing away with it 
on election day. They are going to rein-
state it only because of a Federal 
judge. It is clear President Biden could 
have prevented this border crisis if he 
had not been focused on playing poli-
tics from his first day in office. 
This is Biden’s America. 
How about the fact that President 
Biden didn’t listen to the best military 
advice his top commanders gave him 
when it came to withdrawing troops in 
Afghanistan? America’s best experts— 
GEN 
Mark 
Milley, 
GEN 
Frank 
McKenzie, and GEN Scott Miller—all 
advised the President to keep 2,500 
troops in Afghanistan to remain stable. 
Basically, at the end of the day, this 
was a State Department and Presi-
dent’s decision. 
Instead, 
the 
President’s 
strategy 
turned into billions in American equip-
ment handed over to the Taliban; our 
most valuable airfield, Bagram—maybe 
one of the most valuable in the world— 
abandoned in dead of the night; Ameri-
cans left behind in enemy lines that 
are still there; and a complete aban-
donment of our allies in Afghanistan. 
What a disaster. 
President Biden was more concerned 
about a good September 11 headline 
than a great strategy, more concerned 
about his press than saving American 
lives. The President’s withdrawal will 
continue to be a stain on his legacy. 
Joe Biden created the worst American 
military foreign policy disaster in re-
cent history, and the United States 
will be haunted by this decision for 
many years to come. 
Another fact about this is Biden’s 
America: President Biden’s policies 
have undercut economic growth and 
derailed rapid recovery that was taking 
place under the Trump administration. 
And this was even during a pandemic. 
Now prices are skyrocketing, busi-
nesses can’t find people to work, and 
the United States is facing an unprece-
dented disruption in the supply chain. 
And this administration didn’t know it 
was coming. 
Incredibly, the White House and its 
defenders continue to say that all of 
these deeply concerning realities are 
due to the fact that President Biden 
has been so successful in his economic 
policy. They are using the ‘‘everything 
is so bad because President Biden is 
doing so good’’ argument. Where in the 
world are they getting that from? 
This month, the President’s own 
Chief of Staff promoted the idea that 
inflation is only a ‘‘high-class prob-
lem,’’ the 1 percent. Where has this guy 
been hiding? Try telling that to the 
middle-class families in Alabama who 
are seeing hard-earned money cover 
less at the grocery store and at the 
pump. 
The fact is, prices are rising—not 
just for the wealthy but for everybody. 
Consumer prices are at the highest 
point in 13 years, and inflation is cost-
ing American taxpayers $175 a month. 
Somebody is screwed up. Again, you 
can draw a straight line from the 
President’s decisions to where we are 
now. It is what happens when you pay 
people to not rejoin the workforce, 
force vaccine mandates on workers, sti-
fle growth with regulations, and waste 
trillions and trillions of dollars as our 
country attempts to recover from a 
pandemic. 
And it will only get worse with this 
$3.5 trillion tax-and-spend spree—not if 
when we raise taxes but when we raise 
taxes to pay for this socialist package. 
The American people aren’t going to 
buy into it. 
The fact is that this is Biden’s Amer-
ica. His agenda has led to the border 
crisis, foreign policy disasters, and a fi-
nancial strain on American families. 
This is Biden’s America, where Demo-
crats are focused on finger-pointing 
and scoring political points instead of 
paying attention to the cold, hard facts 
of their policy failures. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
come to the Senate floor today with a 
warning for Kansans and all Americans 
that the inflation we are seeing, 
Bidenflation, as I call it, is here to stay 
so long as those on the left continue to 
jam through reckless tax-and-spend 
bills. 
Unfortunately, the inflation we are 
seeing is a double whammy. You have 
less money to spend, and the things 
you want to buy cost more. It is hurt-
ing every hard-working American but 
none more than our seniors and young 
families living paycheck to paycheck. 
No, President Biden, inflation is not a 
problem of just the high class. Indeed, 
there is no equity in Bidenflation. 
Make no mistake, inflation and all of 
its lingering effects rest squarely on 
the shoulders of President Biden’s 
failed social policies. It is yet another 
crisis created by this administration. 
Having personally lived through the 
seventies and eighties, I have seen in-
flation happen firsthand. I have seen it 
bring so many businesses down. And to 
put it in simpler terms, inflation is a 
vicious cycle, like a dog chasing its 
own tail and the tail is on fire. And, of 
course, the Biden administration has 
been throwing gasoline on this fire 
since the moment they took office. 
Today’s inflation crisis began with 
Joe Biden’s boondoggle stimulus bill 
and the proceeding labor shortages. 
For months now, we are seeing ‘‘Help 
Wanted’’ signs everywhere, from the 
small mom-and-pop shops on Main 
Street to big hotel chains and fast-food 
restaurants. Employers are struggling 
to fill the open jobs they have despite 
raising wages and offering return-to- 
work bonuses. 
This labor shortage is having a rip-
pling effect across our economy, from 
slowing down the supply and logistics 
chains to putting an unfair burden on 
employees who choose to show up. This 
ripple has turned into a tidal wave of 
inflation and now a full-blown tsunami. 
But the storm waves don’t stop there. 
The cost of living has increased as a re-
sult of production delays caused by 
labor shortages. Higher costs at home, 
such as the cost of gasoline, vehicles, 
groceries, and energy costs caused 
workers to go on strike asking for 
higher wages just to make ends meet. 
Folks, I have got news for you: Wages 
never keep up with inflation. All this, 
in turn, drives up the cost of goods and 
services even more. You get the point.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7134 
October 20, 2021 
Inflation is a vicious cycle. This is the 
dog chasing its own tail. 
But Bidenflation doesn’t stop there 
now. Why? Because President Biden is 
throwing more gasoline on the fire 
with his unconstitutional vaccine man-
date. I, too, have seen this firsthand. 
Just last week, I was in Kansas to meet 
with union members who are facing the 
difficult choice of keeping their jobs or 
getting the COVID vaccine. 
These folks aren’t just mad; they are 
panicked. And it is literally job or jab 
for them. In fact, the unions I spoke 
with estimate they will lose 30 to 50 
percent of their workforce due to Joe 
Biden’s vaccine mandate. This will 
make both our supply chain shortages 
as well as inflation even worse. 
Mr. President, while I support the 
COVID vaccine and encourage folks to 
talk to their doctor about whether to 
get it, there is no doubt that President 
Biden’s vaccination decree is an all-out 
assault on our private businesses, our 
civil liberties, and our entire constitu-
tional system of limited government. 
And it is a slap in the face to so 
many 
people 
who 
stood 
on 
the 
frontlines of the COVID battle last 
year 
and 
never 
stopped 
working: 
nurses, doctors, first responders, and 
those union workers I met with last 
week. Trust me, I have heard loud and 
clear these few weeks from Kansans 
about what they want, and it is not an 
unconstitutional vaccine mandate. It is 
not the socialism that is born out of 
trillions of dollars’ worth of spending 
and taxing that has led to reckless in-
flation, hampered our economy, and 
killed our jobs. 
The question is, Do Americans want 
Big Government socialism or do we 
want 
economic 
freedom 
and 
pros-
perity? Kansans agree that if you want 
strong roads, bridges, high-speed inter-
net, good schools, and a strong mili-
tary, we need a strong economy. That 
should be our focus right now, not con-
tinuing down this administration’s so-
cialist economic policies. 
Pre-COVID, we had the greatest 
economy in my lifetime. That came 
about because we lowered people’s 
taxes; we lowered regulations; and we 
lowered energy prices. We need smart, 
targeted 
investments, 
not 
radical 
spending that leaves the country at a 
disadvantage. 
Unfortunately, in the meantime, ev-
eryone better buckle up and grab your 
wallets. Bidenflation is here to stay as 
long as this administration continues 
its reckless taxing, reckless borrowing, 
and reckless spending agenda.

2026 FIFA WORLD CUP 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, be-
fore I wrap up, I want to voice my sup-
port for Kansas City’s bid to serve as 
host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup 
prior to tomorrow’s highly anticipated 
venue visit by FIFA representatives. 
Kansas is home to some of the most 
devoted, fanatic soccer fans in the 
world that are ready to cheer on Team 
USA, and what better place to do it 
than in America’s heartland. The Kan-
sas City community, alongside Sport-
ing KC, has shown unwavering commit-
ment to make this dream a reality, and 
Kansas City is no stranger to hosting 
major sporting events, from the Big 12 
Men’s Basketball Conference Cham-
pionships, NCAA March Madness, and 
plans to host the NFL Football Draft

We have great, fan-friendly facilities 
and something for everyone in the fam-
ily to do. We have the lodging, public 
transportation, shopping and dining 
options needed to make the 2026 World 
Cup a great success. The FIFA World 
Cup is the largest and most prestigious 
single-sport event in the world, and 
there is no better place for it to be held 
than Kansas City. 
Thank you. 
I yield back.

f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to talk about the harmful im-
pacts that President Biden’s policies 
are having on the global supply chain 
and consumer energy prices. 
Americans today are facing the high-
est increase in costs for goods and serv-
ices in over a decade, with inflation 
now more than 5 percent and rising. 
Similarly, our workforce participation 
rate is stagnant. There are still 4.3 mil-
lion fewer workers today than there 
were in February of 2020. Nationally, 
there are more than 10 million job 
openings—more than in any other year. 
Record high job openings, coupled 
with rapidly increasing consumer de-
mand, is causing disruptions to global 
supply chains and further increasing 
costs, increasing inflation. Rather than 
working to spur economic growth, en-
courage workforce participation, and 
return our economy to growth, as we 
saw 
with 
the 
last 
administration, 
President Biden and the Democrats in 
Congress are focused on raising taxes 
and enacting harmful, job-killing poli-
cies. 
A prime example of what I am talk-
ing 
about—harmful 
policies 
being 
pushed by the Biden administration—is 
the Green New Deal that will hinder 
domestic energy production and in-
crease the expense for every American 
household. 
Affordable and reliable energy is 
foundational to our economy, quality 
of life, and national security. Across 
the country and in my home State of 
North Dakota, we are seeing energy 
prices rise across the board. Drivers are 
paying more for fuel at the pump, and 
homes and businesses are prepared for 
record high heating costs as we go into 
the winter months. 
Because the cost of energy is built 
into virtually every product we con-
sume, we are seeing the inflationary 
pressures of higher prices on goods 
across the entire economy, all the way 
to the dinner table. For an energy-rich 
nation such as ours, the situation we 
find ourselves in is unacceptable, and it 
is certainly avoidable. 
In the first week of his administra-
tion, President Biden yanked the per-
mit for the Keystone XL Pipeline and 
halted new oil and gas leases on Fed-
eral 
lands 
and 
offshore. 
President 
Biden’s party has also called for new 
taxes and fees on American energy pro-
duction. 
In addition, the Biden administration 
is promoting foreign energy production 
as he stifles energy production here at 
home. He has allowed completion of 
Russia’s Nord Stream 2 Pipeline while 
calling on Russia, Saudi Arabia, and 
other OPEC nations to increase more 
oil production. Think about that. At a 
time when he is holding back energy 
production in our country—oil produc-
tion in our country, he is asking OPEC, 
Saudi Arabia, and Russia to increase 
oil? It defies common sense. Think 
about it. 
If the Biden administration con-
tinues down this path, it will not only 
cause further increased prices for con-
sumers, but it will undermine our en-
ergy independence and harm our na-
tional security by forcing reliance on 
foreign energy production. 
It is time we recognized the fact that 
our country’s vast oil, gas, and coal re-
sources are a strategic national secu-
rity and economic asset. As we have 
seen over the past decade, greater U.S. 
energy production has strengthened 
our national security and lowered en-
ergy prices for hard-working American 
families. 
The fact is, we should be focused on 
increasing economic growth, encour-
aging workforce participation, and re-
storing 
our 
economy 
to 
its 
prepandemic highs. Support for our do-
mestic energy production is a vital 
step to bringing down prices for con-
sumers, and we need to do it. 
With that, I yield the floor.

October 20, 2021 
IN HONOR OF ANNE HUGHES, 
PH.D., RN 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
along with Speaker NANCY PELOSI to pay trib-
ute to a registered nurse and leader in health 
care for marginalized people, specifically peo-
ple with AIDS and the impoverished. Anne 
Hughes, Ph.D., RN was born in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania in 1953 and studied nursing 
there at Gwynedd Mercy College. She went 
on to Boston College to receive her Master’s 
Degree and then to the University of Wash-
ington in Seattle. She received a Ph.D. in 
nursing from the University of California, San 
Francisco, in 2007. 
Dr. Hughes died earlier this year after more 
than 30 years of service to San Francisco’s 
public health hospitals. She worked at San 
Francisco General Hospital as a clinical nurse 
specialist; hospice nurse and on the HIV/AIDS 
unit. From 1987 to 2000, at the height of the 
epidemic, she provided compassionate care 
when HIV/AIDS was highly stigmatized be-
cause it affected primarily gay men. She 
began in an era when few in the country knew 
much about this disease. 
Dr. Hughes was a soft-spoken leader known 
for her kindness to patients, and colleagues. 
She also served beyond San Francisco and 
helped found the American Association of 
Nurses in AIDS CARE, serving as President of 
the organization in its early years. Dr. Hughes 
used her clinical expertise and served as the 
first co-editor of the ‘‘Core Curriculum for 
Nurses in HIV/AIDS Care,’’ a major under-
taking with over 102 contributors. 
In 2000, Dr. Hughes left San Francisco 
General to work at San Francisco’s Laguna 
Honda Hospital, the largest skilled nursing fa-
cility in the country. Her doctoral study re-
search focused on how poor and homeless 
people die in San Francisco. She brought her 
knowledge of the emerging field of palliative 
care and her hospice experience to Laguna 
Honda. She was the first nurse selected to be 
a department director. She served on San 
Francisco’s End of Life Task Force, an inter-
disciplinary, inter-health system group that 
sought to improve care throughout San Fran-
cisco. 
Dr. Hughes wrote numerous chapters and 
articles on HIV/AIDS, hospice care and pallia-
tive care. She was elected to, and served on, 
the board of the national Hospice and Pallia-
tive Care Nurses Association. Her many ac-
complishments won her an invitation to be in-
ducted as a Fellow into the American Acad-
emy of Nursing. 
As I close these remarks, let me offer 
Speaker PELOSI’s and my condolences to her 
wife, Marylin Dodd, Ph.D. RN, and to her ex-
tended family. The requirements of a public 
health professional likely cost Dr. Hughes 
many hours that might otherwise have been 
devoted to family and friends. In their grief 
they can take comfort from the reality that her 
hours were spent in heroic work, tending to 
the needs of those who, many times, had few 
others who would acknowledge their humanity. 
They can justifiably be proud of all that she 
achieved in her professional life. 
Dr. Hughes gave us a wonderful example of 
what public service can mean to this nation. 
Our nation now extends to her this acknowl-
edgement, in its chronicle of the proceedings 
of Congress. We hope that other stories and 
facts related herein today will rise to the out-
standing example of duty and honor dem-
onstrated by the life of Dr. Hughes.

HONORING ROB WEISS 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Rob S. Weiss 
in recognition of his 25-year career at Mentis, 
Napa’s oldest non-profit organization dedi-
cated to providing affordable bilingual mental 
health services. 
Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, 
Mr. Weiss earned his bachelor’s degree in so-
ciology from the University of California, Los 
Angeles (UCLA) in 1989. He then entered 
UCLA’s Master of Social Welfare (MSW) pro-
gram, where he received his graduate degree 
in social welfare in 1995 and became a li-
censed clinical social worker. Early in his ca-
reer, Mr. Weiss discovered a passion for help-
ing those struggling with their emotional and 
mental health. In 1996, Mr. Weiss began 
working at Mentis, providing therapy and sup-
portive structure for adults living with mental 
illness. As a result of Mr. Weiss’ dedication 
and service, he was promoted first to clinical 
director and then to executive director of the 
agency in 2011. His tireless work and stew-
ardship of the agency is reflected in the 
growth of the population Mentis serves each 
year, which has grown from a few hundred 
people a year to over 3,500 individuals. 
In addition to aiding those with mental 
health illnesses, Mr. Weiss has dedicated time 
to support youth through coaching youth 
sports. His holistic philosophy to coaching has 
provided hundreds of young athletes with the 
mental and emotional skills to face challenges 
both on and off the court. 
Mr. Weiss’ numerous leadership roles in-
clude serving on the Providence Queen of the 
Valley Medical Center’s Committee on Com-
munity Benefits to measure progress of the 
Center’s community outreach health initiatives. 
Mr. Weiss has also served on the Adventist 
Health Community Health Needs Assessment 
Steering Committee to better understand the 
needs of his community. He is a member of 
both the Napa County Aging Population Initia-
tive, a group dedicated to supporting older 
adults in Napa County, and the Community 
Leaders Coalition, a group that supports vul-
nerable populations in Napa County. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Mr. Weiss 
has worked endlessly to serve the most vul-
nerable individuals in our community. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor him 
here today.

CONGRATULATING 
LEWISTOWN’S 
‘‘MUSIC IN THE PARK’’ FOR RE-
CEIVING THE 2020 GOVERNOR’S 
HOMETOWN PROJECT AWARD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the residents of Lewistown, Illi-
nois for their weekly community event, ‘‘Music 
in the Park.’’ 
Each Thursday night during the summer, 
Lewistown residents bring lawn chairs and 
blankets to the town square to listen to local 
musicians perform as a part of ‘‘Music in the 
Park.’’ This event has been a vital place of 
gathering and community and a safe and posi-
tive outlet for human connection during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
It is because of gatherings such as ‘‘Music 
in the Park’’ and their organizers that I am es-
pecially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-
sional District. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
again formally recognize Lewistown, IL for 
their community event, ‘‘Music in the Park.’’

CONGRATULATING 
CRAIG 
BRAN-
DENBURG ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. ALEXANDER X. MOONEY 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. MOONEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Craig Brandenburg, a true 
public servant, on his retirement following five 
decades within the federal government. 
The majority of Craig’s career was spent as 
a civilian employee within the United States 
Navy. Most recently he has served as the Di-
rector of Business Operations for Logistics, 
Maintenance, and Industrial Operations at 
Naval Sea Systems Command. In this capac-
ity he has been responsible for policy develop-
ment, mission direction, program execution, 
operation and evaluation of naval ship life 
cycle logistics, information systems, and cor-
porate leadership of the Naval Shipyards, and 
Supervisors of Shipbuilding. You could say he 
has come a long way from his beginnings with 
the federal government as a typist with the 
National Archives in the 1970s. 
Throughout his long career, Craig has 
championed cutting-edge ideas, coordinated 
Navy-wide support of sailor’s and their family’s 
needs, and overseen a variety of efforts to in-
clude billion dollar programs. Thanks to his

strategic leveraging of IT solutions, the

shore-based infrastructure anytime any day. In 
fact, we have Craig to thank for many new 
and groundbreaking developments within the 
United States Navy. 
In recognition of his outstanding contribu-
tions to the Navy, Craig has received the 
Chief Information Officer eBusiness Govern-
ment Award, the Civilian Meritorious Achieve-
ment Medal, the National Partnership for Rein-
venting Government Vice President Hammer 
Award, the CNO’s VADM Stanley Arthur Lo-
gistics Excellence Award, and the American 
Society of Naval Engineers Clifford G. Geiger 
Award recognizing his 25 years of significant 
career contributions to logistics readiness of 
the Naval services. 
Craig 
managed 
many 
large 
programs 
throughout his impressive career, but his true 
passion was for leading those who worked for 
him. He has touched many programs and 
many people, and I know he will be missed by 
them all. I thank Craig for his contributions to 
this country and congratulations on his retire-
ment. We know that his family and his children 
Lauren and Connor are proud of his accom-
plishments.

RECOGNIZING 
BARBARA 
ZIARKO, 
MICHIGAN MUNICIPAL LEAGUE’S 
NEW VICE PRESIDENT 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Barbara Ziarko who 
has been selected as the Michigan Municipal 
League’s 2021–2022 Vice President. 
Barbara has been a Sterling Heights resi-
dent for forty-two years and has given much of 
her time and talent to the community, includ-
ing serving as a member of the Sterling 
Heights City Council for twenty years. She 
was a Macomb Foundation Athena Award 
nominee, which helps to demonstrate her ex-
emplary leadership and community service. 
Throughout the years, Barbara has been 
deeply involved with numerous community or-
ganizations, including serving as co-coordi-
nator for the Macomb County Rotating Emer-
gency Shelter Team at St. Blase Catholic 
Community, as a committee member of the 
American Cancer Society’s Relay for Life 
event in Sterling Heights for five years, as a 
member of the Regina High School Board of 
Directors for seven years, and as a member of 
the American Polish Century Club Ladies Aux-
iliary. 
In her new role with the Michigan Municipal 
League, Barbara has pledged to work on the 
organization’s 
ongoing 
community 
wealth 
building and diversity, equity, and inclusion ef-
forts. I have no doubt that the remarkable 
leadership she has displayed in Sterling 
Heights will benefit the entire State of Michi-
gan. 
I am truly proud to have the honor of recog-
nizing Barbara Ziarko as she takes on this im-
portant role for the Michigan Municipal League 
in 2021–22. I invite my colleagues to join me 
in offering her, and the Michigan Municipal 
League, very best wishes for a successful 
year ahead. 
REMEMBERING MICHELLE LYN 
PRESENT 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to a close friend who passed away late 
last year following a courageous battle against 
cancer. 
Michelle Lyn Present was a young woman 
blessed with many talents and virtues. She 
possessed an abounding faith, which enabled 
her to persevere through a very long and dif-
ficult struggle until her passing on December 
3, 2020. Not only did she not allow darkness 
to shadow her days, Michelle was a beacon of 
light that never flickered but always shone 
brightly; indeed, hers was a light that helped 
to guide others in overcoming challenges of 
their own. 
I came to know Michelle through her par-
ents, Marti and Kenny Cox. Kenny was a 
former member of the District of Columbia Fire 
Department and, for many years, the Vice 
President of the International Association of 
Fire Fighters Local 26. Michelle’s parents in-
stilled in her their value of service to others 
and their love of community and country. 
Among her many talents, Michelle was a 
very gifted singer. She was always willing to 
share her beautiful voice, whether in her 
church or at fire-service events. For many 
years, she performed at the National Fallen 
Firefighters Memorial Ceremony. At the re-
quest of the late Hal Bruno, former Chairman 
of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation, 
she would perform the song ‘Precious Memo-
ries.’ The sound of her voice resonated 
throughout the gathered assembly of family 
members and fire-service officials. It was a 
voice that I always looked forward to hearing 
each year at the very moving ceremony. 
On behalf of the Congressional Fire Serv-
ices Caucus leadership, I extend my condo-
lences to Michelle’s husband Jack and their 
daughter Taylor, to her parents Kenny and 
Marti, to her brother Ken Jr., and to her entire 
family. In remembrance of a dear friend who 
was called home too early, I would like to 
share the words from ’Precious Memories’ 
with my fellow Members of the House. I hope 
you will find them as uplifting as I did when-
ever Michelle sang them to the families of fall-
en firefighters and all of us who were there to 
support them each year. 
Precious memories, unseen angels, 
Sent from somewhere to my soul 
How they linger, ever near me, 
And the sacred scenes unfold 
Precious memories, how they linger, 
How they ever flood my soul 
In the stillness of the midnight, 
Precious, sacred scenes unfold 
Precious father, loving mother, 
Fly across the lonely years 
And old home scenes of my childhood, 
In fond memory appear 
In the stillness of the midnight, 
Echoes from the past I hear 
Old-time singing, gladness bringing, 
From that lovely land somewhere 
I remember mother praying, 
Father, too, on bended knee 
Sun is sinking, shadows falling, 
But their prayers still follow me 
As I travel on life’s pathway, 
Know not what the years may hold 
As I ponder, hope grows fonder, 
Precious memories flood my soul 
May the precious memories of Michelle Lyn 
Present be a comfort and a blessing to all 
those who knew her and to all those to whom 
she brought her many gifts in life.

RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE TRAVERSE CITY 
ELKS LODGE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 125th Anniversary of 
the Traverse City Elks Lodge. Through their 
steadfast devotion and service to their com-
munity, Lodge No. 323 has become an indis-
pensable part of Michigan’s First District. 
Since 1896, the Traverse City Elks Lodge 
has not only worked to provide a supportive 
environment for their members, but has also 
continuously assisted others in their commu-
nity through service and charity. Since their 
establishment, TCEL has worked to follow and 
uphold their four cardinal virtues: Charity, Jus-
tice, Brotherly Love and Fidelity. 
As a result, their organization has helped 
many Michiganders and families through the 
multiple charities and scholarships they work 
with. This notably includes the Elks National 
Foundation which provides $3.64 million in 
college scholarships each year. In addition, 
their work with the Michigan Elks Major 
Project supports special needs children that 
do not receive assistance from other agencies 
or groups. Their help has improved the lives of 
countless Americans and their families, and 
their dedication to the well-being of our com-
munities cannot be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
Traverse City Elks Lodge for decades of suc-
cess and service to Northern Michigan. 
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing 
the First District is home to such dedicated 
citizens. On behalf of my constituents, I wish 
them all the best in their future endeavors.

IN HONOR OF WILLIE JAMES 
‘‘BILL’’ MCNAIR 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the life of Willie James ‘‘Bill’’ McNair, 
Sr. who passed away after a long and fruitful 
life at 102 years of age on September 26, 
2021, in Port Saint Joe Florida. 
Mr. McNair served honorably in the U.S. 
Army during World War II and was a member 
of VFW Post 10069. On his return from serv-
ice, he served for 30 years as a mail carrier 
for the St. Joe Paper Company. As a licensed 
chauffeur, Mr. McNair also drove top execu-
tives to and from the airport before retiring in 
1981. 
Willie James McNair Sr. celebrated his 
100th birthday in July 2019 with more than 
200 family members and friends, including the 
last of Mr. McNair’s surviving siblings, Mildred 
98 and Mercedes 96 years old at that time. All 
three siblings share the same birthday—July 
16th, born two years apart. 
Mr. McNair was presented with a com-
memoration for his birthday signifying his serv-
ice on the Trustee Board of Zion Fair Mis-
sionary Baptist Church and another honoring 
his service to the community. 
Madam Speaker, again, I ask the House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the 
long life of Willie James ‘‘Bill’’ McNair, Sr.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 35TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE OPENING OF 
ACADEMY HILL SCHOOL 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to congratulate the Acad-
emy Hill School on celebrating their 35th anni-
versary. This milestone achievement deserves 
the highest praise for the hard work and dedi-
cation of the school’s faculty and staff, as well 
those students whose remarkable commitment 
to learning has played a pivotal role in the 
school’s success. 
Although established in 1986, the Academy 
Hill School began operating in 1979, offering 
enrichment classes to gifted students through-
out the Greater Springfield community. Two 
years after opening their full-time day school 
in 1986, the Academy Hill Center for Gifted 
Children was incorporated as a non-profit or-
ganization. Over the next three decades, 
Academy Hill would grow and expand their 
campus, relocating to their current location on 
Liberty Street in Springfield, and nearly dou-
bling their total enrollment in their K–8 pro-
gram. This past year has reminded us of the 
critical role our schools play in our children’s 
lives, with millions of educators across the 
country taking on the tremendous responsi-
bility of providing our students equitable edu-
cational opportunities in a safe and healthy 
environment. Therefore, I cannot think of a 
more appropriate occasion to celebrate all that 
the Academy Hill School has accomplished 
over the past 35 years. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to once again 
congratulate the Academy Hill School on cele-
brating their 35th anniversary, and thank them 
for continuing to inspire our students. Acad-
emy Hill is a cherished member of Massachu-
setts’ First District, and I wish them many 
more years of success and prosperity.

HONORING ELBA GONZALEZ- 
MARES 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA

Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Elba Gonzalez- 
Mares in celebration of her 15th anniversary at 
Community Health Initiative (CHI) in Napa 
County. 
Born in Puebla, Mexico, Ms. Gonzalez- 
Mares moved to California when she was just 
a year old, and now lives in Napa, California. 
She attended the University of California, 
Davis where she received her bachelor’s de-
gree in international relations in 2005. After 
finding her passion for helping the most vul-
nerable in her community, Ms. Gonzalez- 
Mares began working as a health access as-
sistant at Community Health Initiative, a non-
profit organization dedicated to enrolling fami-
lies in affordable health insurance plans. She 
then became the coordinator and manager for 
the organization before working her way up to 
becoming the executive director. She has ex-
panded CHI from serving only the Napa com-
munity to serving several counties throughout 
California. As a result of her commitment to 
aiding underprivileged communities, Ms. Gon-
zalez-Mares has helped thousands of individ-
uals and families gain access to quality health 
care coverage. 
In addition to serving in her various roles at 
CHI, Ms. Gonzalez-Mares has held numerous 
positions dedicated to helping underserved 
communities. She became the board chair of 
California Coverage and Health Initiatives 
(CCHI), a statewide association that helps 
families navigate through affordable healthcare 
services. Ms. Gonzalez-Mares became com-
missioner for First 5 Napa County, a nonprofit 
that provides support services for early child-
hood development. She was also elected as 
the president of the Napa Valley Unified 
School District Board of Trustees. Ms. Gon-
zalez-Mares is a member of the Community 
Leaders Coalition, an organization that advo-
cates for vulnerable populations within the 
Napa County community. Additionally, Ms. 
Gonzalez-Mares has assisted in creating a 
model for organizations similar to CHI to help 
individuals enroll in health care coverage and 
access health care services. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Ms. Gon-
zalez-Mares has selflessly dedicated her ca-
reer to helping Napa’s most vulnerable com-
munities. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that 
we honor her here today.

PROJECT AWARD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Mount Carroll’s ‘‘Arbor Day 
Palooza’’ for its effort to replace trees that 
were lost to bugs, disease and storms. The or-
ganization received the 2020 Governor’s 
Hometown Project Award for the incredible 
work it has done for the community. 
The idea for ‘‘Arbor Day Palooza’’ was born 
from a desire to retain the character of the 
town, as it has been recognized as a Tree 
City for over 26 years. The city created a Tree 
Replacement Fund and the community bought 
in with many volunteers and donors coming 
forward to assist. In total, the project received 
over $13,000 in donations used to plant 52 
new trees on city property, hold an Arbor Day 
tree planting ceremony in the new Stone 
House Memorial Park and host a tour of the 
Stone House site. 
It is because of events like ‘‘Arbor Day 
Palooza’’ and their organizers that make me 
proud to represent Illinois’ 17th Congressional 
District. Madam Speaker, I would like to again 
formally honor ‘‘Arbor Day Palooza’’ for being 
awarded the 2020 Governor’s Hometown 
Project Award for their efforts in the commu-
nity.

Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, I offer the fam-

community of Mayor Tiffany Graham, my 
deepest condolences as I share the pain of 
this untimely loss. 
Mayor Graham was best known for her re-

a public servant wonderfully and was dedi-
cated to doing the best for her residents. She 
never hesitated to go above and beyond to 
make sure those she served got her very best 
every single day. 
The impact of her work reverberates 
throughout the Greendale community and be-

ing the way she lived hers, with an unyielding 
commitment to service.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
POLICE CHIEF STEVEN PARKER 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the service of Steven Parker, a 
beloved community leader and Police Chief of 
the Tega Cay Police Department. 
Chief Parker has dedicated nearly three 
decades of his life to protecting communities 
throughout North and South Carolina. He 
began his law enforcement career at the 
Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office twenty- 
eight years ago. In 1995, he transferred to the 
Rock Hill Police Department where he served 
in various divisions, including: Training, Inves-
tigations, Patrol, Traffic, K-9, and Narcotics. 
Throughout his twenty years of unparalleled 
service at the Rock Hill Police Department, the 
agency received numerous accolades and rec-
ognitions, including CALEA National Honors, 
AAA Outstanding Traffic Safety Community 
Award, and the SWAT South East National 
Championships. Chief Parker’s time at the 
Rock Hill Police Department ended with him 
commanding over 150 employees as Major 
over Field Services. 
In 2015, Chief Parker became the Police 
Chief of the Tega Cay Police Department. 
Under his leadership, the Tega Cay Police De-
partment attained South Carolina Accreditation 
status for the first time in its history. The City 
of Tega Cay was also ranked ‘‘The Top 3 
Safest City’’ in South Carolina for seven years 
in a row and ‘‘The 64th Safest City’’ in the 
United States, all while growing at a rapid 
pace. Chief Parker also managed the design 
and construction of a new state of the art po-
lice station while serving and protecting over 
12,000 citizens. 
Throughout Chief Parker’s tenure as Police 
Chief of the Tega Cay Police Department, he 
emphasized the importance of building trust 
and community relationships. Leading by ex-
ample, Chief Parker and the rest of the Tega 
Cay Police Department support the Special 
Olympics each year by organizing an annual 
Torch Run, Donut Eating Contest, and Polar 
Plunge. 
The career of Chief Parker is a testament to 
all the good our men and women in blue do 
for our communities. A true servant-leader, he 
leaves behind a legacy of progress and suc-
cess. On behalf of the 5th District of South 
Carolina, I thank Chief Parker for his service 
and wish him all the best in his future endeav-
ors. Tega Cay has truly been blessed to have 
him as a community guardian for the past 
seven years.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
PIERMONT 
FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR 
HEROIC RESCUE RESPONSES TO 
HURRICANE IDA 
HON. MONDAIRE JONES 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, in early Sep-
tember, our communities in Westchester and 
Rockland suffered immensely in the aftermath 
of Hurricane Ida, with flooded basements, 
damaged homes, and, tragically, lives lost. I 
witnessed the damage firsthand, touring some 
of our hardest hit communities and thanking 
our brave first responders, including the Vil-
lage of Piermont Fire Department, whose ma-
rine diver unit rescued dozens of Rocklanders 
from the floors. I am devastated for all those 
impacted by this disaster, and I will not stop 
working until our communities have fully re-
built. 
The Piermont Fire Department responded 
bravely to over 30 emergencies within Rock-
land County. During the height of the storm, 
the Piermont Dive Team heroically assisted in 
multiple water search and rescue efforts. 22 
cars were searched by Fire Department mem-
bers in Rockland, including a dive operation in 
the Village of Spring Valley on a car that was 
submerged in 7.5 feet of water. 
While the Dive Team responded to water 
rescues, other members of the Piermont Fire 
Department responded to emergencies such 
as flooding conditions, roadway hazards, 
downed trees and wires, and an unmanned 
boat throughout Rockland County. The rescue 
teams went to Sparkill, Tappan, and West 
Nyack to respond to vehicles in the water with 
trapped victims inside. All victims were res-
cued safely thanks to the heroic efforts of the 
Fire Department volunteers. 
Many lives were saved by the brave volun-
teers of the Piermont Fire Department. Our 
community is forever grateful for their tireless 
work to keep us safe. I would like to recognize 
and thank the following people for their brav-

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF CLARA DOUTLY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Clara Doutly, a lifelong 
resident of Detroit, Michigan on the occasion 
of her 100th birthday. Her contributions to our 
community as a Rosie the Riveter are worthy 
of commendation, 
Born at Herman Keifer Hospital in Detroit, 
Michigan, she was the youngest of six sib-
lings. She fondly remembers summers spent 
at Green Pastures Camp, a successful pro-
gram of the Detroit Urban League for children 
to spend time in the great outdoors. An excel-
lent student, she attended the prestigious 
Cass Technical High School. After the bomb-
ing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent en-
trance of the United States into World War II, 
Mrs. Doutly heard the call and started working 
at Briggs Manufacturing Company in Detroit, 
making parts for the B–29 bomber aircraft. 
She worked there as a riveter from 1942 until 
the end of the war in 1945. As a Rosie, 
Clara’s hard work, grit, and patriotism not only 
sustained the American war effort, but paved 
a path for the next generation of working 
women. 
Now a member of the American Rosie the 
Riveter Association, she seeks to preserve 
and celebrate the legacy of the Rosies. 
Through her membership, she’s been able to 
board the first ever Rosie the Riveter Honor 
Flight to Washington, D.C., participate in the 
Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade, and has 
been featured in National Geographic—includ-
ing in the June 2020 issue commemorating 
the 75th anniversary of the end of World War 
II. 
Full of life and joy, even at age 100, Mrs. 
Doutly’s sayings and stories are legendary 
among those who know her. She is a living 
witness to history and loves to talk about her 
experiences during World War II. She talks of 
the days of Detroit’s Paradise Valley, where 
she enjoyed the renowned musicians and 
nightlife. After the war ended, she married Syl-
vester Doutly and worked at Detroit Public

Center in Detroit for over three decades, she 
is an active participant in the center’s activities 
and trips. Prior to the pandemic, she could be 
found there catching up with friends each day. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Clara Doutly on her

friends in extending my best and warmest

Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today

100 years of service to the Geneseo commu-
nity. 
The Geneseo Kiwanis Club was chartered

serve the community. In addition to donating 
to over 20 local charities, the Geneseo 
Kiwanis Club provides a scholarship for stu-
dents and sponsors GMS Builders Club, GHS 
Key Club and Boy Scout Troop 131. The orga-
nization also provides free tax help, hosts 
fundraising events, built the Geneseo City 
Park shelter, and raised tens of thousands of 
dollars to help eliminate neonatal tetanus 
throughout the world. 
It is because of strong community organiza-
tions such as the Geneseo Kiwanis Club that 
I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th 
Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I

FRANKLIN 
CHANG-

HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Dr. Franklin Chang-Dı´az for being se-
lected as one of the 100 Most Intriguing Entre-
preneurs of 2021 at Goldman Sachs’s Builders 
+ Innovators Summit in Healdsburg, California. 
Selected as one of 100 entrepreneurs from 
a diverse range of groundbreaking industries. 
Dr. Chang-Dı´az currently serves as the Chief 
Executive Officer of Ad Astra Rocket Com-
pany in Webster, TX. He spent 25 years as a 
decorated NASA astronaut, flying seven mis-
sions into space. When he retired from NASA 
in 2005, he founded the Ad Astra Rocket 
Company to continue the development of his 
invention, 
the 
Variable 
Specific 
Impulse 
Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) engine. 
The VASlMR engine is an advanced plasma 
space propulsion system that will revolutionize 
space travel. With VASIMR, a sustainable, ef-
ficient, and high-powered engine, we can stay 
longer and travel further in space. Dr. Franklin 
Chang-Dı´az and his company. Ad Astra, are 
transforming the trajectory of our space indus-
try. 
Using plasma physics to bring the advanced 
rocket technology to life, Ad Astra plans to 
commercialize the VASIMR engine by 2025 
for the emerging in-space transportation mar-
ket. The VASIMR engine’s capabilities will 
vastly change how we think about space trav-
el. Transit to Mars will be shorter by several 
months, enabling more robust human missions 
to the Red Planet and beyond. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to honor Dr. 
Franklin Chang-Dı´az for his extraordinary 
achievements and leadership in the field of 
space transportation.

DAN HEINS TRIBUTE 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to Dr. Daniel Heins, who will be re-
tiring at the end of this month from his position 
as national president of the United Post-
masters and Managers of America (UPMA). 
Dan began his accomplished postal career in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota in March of 1981 as a 
distribution and window clerk. He rose through 
the ranks as a letter carrier, a supervisor, a 
station manager, and then in 2010, he was 
appointed postmaster in Stewartville, Min-
nesota. Prior to his election as UPMA national 
president, Dan served in various leadership 
positions within the Minnesota Chapter of 
UPMA, including district director, executive 
vice-president, secretary-treasurer, and nine 
years as a chapter president. Nationally, Dan 
served in roles as vice-president and sec-
retary-treasurer before being elected president 
on November 1, 2018. UPMA has 25,000 ac-
tive and retired members including post-
masters, managers, supervisors, retirees and 
associate members. Dan is committed to mak-
ing sure that UPMA does everything possible 
to improve the lives of their members at all 
levels of the organization. As the organiza-
tion’s first president, Dan worked hard to es-
tablish UPMA as a trusted voice among pol-
icymakers on Capitol Hill. He was singularly 
determined to advocate on both sides of the 
aisle for comprehensive postal reform to en-
sure that the USPS continues to exist. Dan 
shared his personal belief in the importance of 
reform so future employees could have the 
same opportunities for personal growth that 
Dan had been blessed with. His passion for 
being a postmaster and his professional com-
mitment to a successful USPS have been un-
assailable. In 2019, Dan led a successful 
UPMA convention and followed up on his 
commitment to building and growing a dy-
namic association by having record attend-
ance at the Congressional Summit in early 
2020. Hundreds of postmasters who came to 
Washington under Dan’s leadership last year 
to advocate for postal reform and their bene-
fits. About a month after that successful sum-
mit, the COVID–19 public health crisis struck. 
Dan immediately jumped into action, commu-
nicating to policymakers on Capitol Hill the 
dire situation the USPS was in and the need 
for supplemental funding to provide PPE and 
ensure the timely delivery of the unprece-
dented volume of packages from local stay-at- 
home orders. In the summer of 2020, Dan and 
his wife, Karen, traveled the country to a num-
ber of UPMA state conventions, demonstrating 
his commitment to the vitality and success of 
the Association. Even though the 2020 na-
tional convention welcomed only a fraction of 
its usual attendance, Dan made sure that 
postmasters continued to come together and 
be recognized for the essential work they do. 
In the fall of 2020, as postmasters throughout 
the country prepared for record vote-by-mail 
turnout, Dan was a steady voice to his mem-
bers assuring them that postmasters and post-
al employees would rise to the challenge. I 
was proud to meet with my local postmasters 
from Southern Illinois during this year’s Con-
gressional Summit and thank them for the es-
sential service they do every day. Madam 
Speaker, I am proud to recognize Dan Heins 
for his leadership as president of the United 
Postmasters of America. I also recognize his 
wife, Karen, a true partner to Dan whose 
steadfast support has helped him achieve his 
success. As a new president takes office, I 
know that a solid foundation has been built by 
UPMA because of the work of President Dan 
Heins.

He was a highly decorated Veteran of the 
United States Army, having served in World 
War II in Burma, China, and India as a mem-
ber of the famous Merrill’s Marauders. 
Officially named the 5307th Composite Unit 
(Provisional), this elite unit was a United 
States long range penetration special oper-
ations jungle warfare unit which fought in the 
South-East Asian theatre of World War II. In 
slightly more than five months of combat, the 
Marauders had advanced nearly 1,000 miles 
through some of the harshest jungle in the 
world, fought in five major engagements and 
battled hunger, fevers, and diseases as they 
traversed more jungle terrain than any other 
U.S. Army formation during World War II. 
They had the rare distinction of each soldier 
being awarded the Bronze Star, Silver Star 
and the Burma Liberation Medal. Their unit 
was also awarded the Distinguished Unit Cita-
tion.

GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY OF 
THE VETERAN ADMINISTRATION 
DOMICILIARY 
PROGRAM 
AND 
PSYCHOSOCIAL 
OUTPATIENT 
CENTER 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
the construction of the Veterans Administration 
Domiciliary Program & Psychosocial Out-
patient Center in Puerto Rico is a long over-
due facility that will serve Veterans in the geo-
graphic area of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Vir-
gin Islands, including close to 23,000 mental 
health patients. The Center will complement 
the Veterans Administration Carribean Health 
System (VACHS) with Psychosocial Residen-
tial Rehabilitation Treatment Programs to as-
sist Veterans living with mental illness. The 
programs will assist the Veteran by instilling 
hope, validating strengths, teaching skills, and 
facilitating community integration so that each 
Veteran can develop meaningful self-deter-
mined roles in the community. 
With 52,000 net usable square feet and 177 
parking spaces and an investment of approxi-
mately $50 million dollars, the VA Domiciliary 
Program & Psychosocial Outpatient Center will 
include a Residential Program and a Psycho-
social Recovery Program. In the facility the 
veterans of the region will be able to receive 
services close to their homes, rather than re-
ferring them to other facilities in the U.S. main-
land, which could deprive our Veterans from 
their family support and limiting their ability to 
fully benefit from the services received, due to 
cultural and language barriers, 
The Veterans of Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin 
Islands have never wavered in their resolve to 
give their best in the defense of the Nation. 
Overcoming social norms and without full rep-
resentation in the U.S. Congress, as deserved 
by all American citizens, they persevered and 
are an inspiration to all of us. 
Today, October 20, 2021, the words of 
President Abraham Lincoln, ‘‘To care for him 
who shall have borne the battle,’’ that are the 
motto of the VA, are fulfilled as we celebrate 
the ground breaking of the construction of the 
Veterans Administration Domiciliary Program 
& Psychosocial Outpatient Center in Puerto 
Rico. I hope we can all be inspired by the ex-
ample of the Veterans of Puerto Rico and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands and ask that we can com-
mit ourselves to making sure that the words of 
President Abraham Lincoln compel us to strive 
without rest to serve those who served.

IN MEMORY OF CHRIS PACE 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a great American, Christopher Jack 
Pace. Chris was a dedicated public servant 
and a leader in Clark County, Kentucky. He 
passed away on October 14, 2021 at 44 years 
of age. 
Chris was elected as the County Judge-Ex-
ecutive of Clark County in November of 2018. 
He took office the following January and 
proved from that first day to be a caring and 
competent leader for the community that he 
loved. Chris was well-respected by all those 
he encountered in his position as Judge-Exec-
utive. I was honored to collaborate with Chris 
on many projects to benefit the community. 
On a personal note, I was honored to consider 
Chris a personal friend. 
Chris was a graduate of George Rogers 
Clark High School, Eastern Kentucky Univer-
sity, 
and 
Northern 
Kentucky 
University’s 
Chase College of Law. Chris served as Stu-
dent Government President at both EKU and 
NKU. He was a leader who served the com-
munity on several boards. Chris was a youth 
soccer and Upward basketball coach, as well 
as the public address announcer for GRC 
volleyball. Most importantly, Chris was a 
Christian who was strong in his faith in Jesus. 
He tried to follow Him daily and was a Godly 
example to us all. Chris was a member of Cal-
vary Christian Church. 
Chris loved his family deeply. He was the 
husband of Shannon, father of Jack, Roman, 
and Maria, son of Betty Pace and the late 
Donald Pace, and brother to Donna Gail 
Baker and Donald Pace, Jr. He had a large 
and loving extended family. 
Chris was the epitome of a good family 
man, a good citizen, and a good leader. He 
loved his community and his country. He will 
be greatly missed by all who were blessed to 
have known him. He loved life and lived it en-
thusiastically as evidenced by the genuine 
smile that was always on his face. It is my 
honor to lift up the life of Christopher Jack 
Pace before the United States Congress.

CONGRATULATING 
CHIEF 
KEVIN 
SHOOK 
ON 
HIS 
RETIREMENT 
FROM THE KEWANEE FIRE DE-
PARTMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Chief Kevin Shook, who is retir-
ing from the Kewanee Fire Department after 
23 years of service. 
Chief Shook has been a member of the 
Kewanee Fire Department since 1998. Work-
ing his way through the ranks, he became 
Chief of the Department in 2016. His steadfast 
determination to keep his community safe, 
strive for innovation, and ensure the prepared-
ness of the Kewanee Fire Department has 
been unwavering throughout his career in pub-
lic service. Earlier this year, under Chief 
Shook’s guidance, the Department was award-
ed a $205,431 regional grant through the As-
sistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program. 
This transformative investment to the city of 
Kewanee was made possible because of 
Chief Shook, one of the latest examples of his 
strong leadership. 
It is because of dedicated and selfless lead-
ers such as Chief Shook that I am especially 
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to, again, 
formally congratulate Chief Kevin Shook on 
his well-earned retirement and thank him for 
his 23 years of service to our community.

IN RECOGNITION OF PENN-MONT 
ACADEMY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 20, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize Penn-Mont Academy in 
Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, as they celebrate 
their 60th year providing a Montessori edu-
cation to the students of our community. 
Penn-Mont Academy was founded in 1961 
by Aline and Gerald Wolf, who founded the 
school in their home with a vision to create 
one of the first Montessori institutions in the 
United States. 
Over the past 60 years, the school has 
worked to provide a creative and insightful 
education that molds independent-and lifelong 
learners. 
This school is important to my family and 
me. My wife, Dr. Alice Plummer Joyce, was 
one of the school’s first graduates. 
I am incredibly grateful for the outstanding 
work that The Penn-Mont Academy does in 
our community. From the Wolfs front porch to 
their current home in Hollidaysburg the Penn- 
Mont Academy has offered generations of stu-
dents the foundation they need to succeed. 
The school’s commitment to educating the 
children of Blair County is exceptional, and I 
look forward to their continued work to support 
and inspire our future leaders. 
On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania’s 
13th Congressional District, I congratulate the 
students, staff, and administration of Penn- 
Mont Academy on reaching this historic mile-
stone and wish them every continued success 
in the years to come.
