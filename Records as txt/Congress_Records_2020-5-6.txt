PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we continue to depend 
on You to fulfill Your purposes for our 
lives. You have told us that Your pur-
pose for us is that we live for Your 
glory. As our lawmakers strive to do 
Your will, bringing honor to Your 
name, have Your way in all they say 
and do. 
Lord, send them Your help from ce-
lestial portals so that they will please 
You and be Your ambassadors during 
these challenging times. Rescue them 
from anything that will keep them 
from remembering that nothing is im-
possible for you. 
Be exalted, O God, above the highest 
heavens. Let Your glory shine in our 
Nation and world. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
to speak in morning business for 1

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. COVID–19 has put 
America through the wringer. There 
will be many lessons learned and sto-
ries to tell from this chapter of our his-
tory. 
Today, I salute the heroes working 
on the frontlines during this pandemic. 
I can’t overstate the debt of gratitude 
we owe the healthcare professionals 
who selflessly put their own lives on 
the line to care for COVID–19 patients. 
Our doctors, nurses, respiratory thera-
pists, nursing home workers, phar-
macists, 
and 
first 
responders 
are 
among those who have shouldered 
physical and mental exhaustion to heal 
the sick. In fact, today is National 
Nurses Day. So I give our nurses an 
extra applause on this their day. To 
the legions of healthcare professionals 
across America, thank you for the full 
measure of devotion you have shown to 
your community and to our great 
country. 
I yield the floor.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time

NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
core business of our Nation does not 
stop while we fight the coronavirus. 
This week, Senate committees are con-
ducting oversight and holding hear-
ings. Members are tracking the imple-
mentation of the CARES Act. We are 
discussing how Congress could do ev-
erything from further strengthening 
the health response to ensuring that a 
second epidemic of frivolous lawsuits 
does not redirect the national recovery 
into a trial lawyer bonanza. 
Here on the floor, we are filling 
major vacancies in the Federal Govern-
ment. Today, we will confirm Bill 
Evanina to lead the National Counter-
intelligence and Security Center. As 
our Nation grapples with challenges at 
home, it is critically important that a 
full complement of skilled profes-
sionals keep a close watch on our foes, 
adversaries, and competitors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2254 
May 6, 2020 
Mr. Evanina’s nomination will make 
him the first Senate-confirmed Direc-
tor of the NCSC. This role represents 
our government’s senior-most expert in 
counterintelligence. Fortunately, this 
nominee has served for 3 decades as 
special agent with the FBI, as chief of 
the CIA’s Counterespionage Group, and 
as one of the principal advisers to the 
Director of National Intelligence. 
Mr. Evanina’s long professional expe-
rience has given him a well-trained 
eye. He has made clear he is focused on 
the most serious espionage threats fac-
ing our country today: China’s insid-
ious efforts to steal our industrial, gov-
ernmental, technological, and political 
secrets and Russia’s continuing efforts 
to meddle in our democracy. We have a 
qualified professional who is tailor- 
made for an important job. Our col-
leagues on the Intelligence Committee 
have reported him out on a unanimous 
bipartisan basis twice. The vice chair-
man, Senator WARNER, said: ‘‘Bill 
Evanina should be confirmed without 
further delay.’’ 
But even still, our Democratic col-
leagues chose to obstruct his nomina-
tion on the floor this week and require 
a full day of floor time to confirm. 
Ironically, at the same time, we have 
also heard some of our Democratic col-
leagues complain that we spend too 
much time voting on nominations. It is 
bad enough to spend 3 years delaying 
nominations to a historic degree and 
deliberately making the process pain-
ful, but it reached a new level of irony 
for our Democratic friends to do all 
that and then complain that their own 
strategy 
is 
inconveniencing 
their 
schedules. 
Essential matters of government do 
not cease because of the coronavirus. 
They do not cease because of partisan-
ship either. As long as Senate Demo-
crats continue to make incredibly 
qualified nominees travel the hard 
way, including someone whom their 
own Democratic ranking member open-
ly praised, then, I will assure them 
they will need to continue to show up 
and cast votes. The country’s business 
will not go undone. 
NOMINATION OF JUSTIN WALKER 
Mr. President, speaking of nomina-
tions, this morning our colleagues on 
the Judiciary Committee are exam-
ining the qualifications of Judge Justin 
Walker. Judge Walker is a fellow Ken-
tuckian. He is a district judge of the 
Western District of Kentucky, and he 
is President Trump’s nominee to serve 
on our second most important Federal 
Court, the Court of Appeals for the Dis-
trict of Columbia. 
I am grateful to Chairman GRAHAM 
and all the other chairmen who are 
finding creative ways to conduct im-
portant business. The Senate is dem-
onstrating that the work of governing 
must and can continue, albeit in new 
ways. 
So to respect this time of social 
distancing, I am going to offer my in-
troduction here on the floor instead of 
over in the committee. Since Judge 
Walker was tapped to serve the people 
of Kentucky on the Federal district 
bench, he wasted no time in expanding 
his strong reputation for intellectual 
brilliance, legal acumen, and total fair-
ness and impartiality. 
In just the last few weeks, Judge 
Walker has won national attention for 
an eloquent and persuasive opinion 
that forcefully defended Kentuckians’ 
basic First Amendment freedom of reli-
gion, and he has earned a ‘‘well-quali-
fied’’ 
rating 
from 
the 
left-leaning 
American Bar Association that Senate 
Democrats, like my friend the Demo-
cratic leader, have frequently described 
as ‘‘the gold standard.’’ 
Let me say that again. In the span of 
just a couple of weeks, almost simulta-
neously, Judge Walker has won praise 
from religious freedom advocates na-
tionwide and the approval of the ABA, 
which Democrats call ‘‘the gold stand-
ard.’’ That illustrates the kind of im-
pressive individual the committee is 
considering this morning. 
Already, Judge Walker’s reputation 
as a brilliant legal rising star precedes 
him. Yet, when you consider the full 
scope of his education and experience, 
it is hardly a surprise. Judge Walker 
graduated 
from 
Duke 
University 
summa cum laude. He graduated from 
Harvard Law School magna cum laude, 
and he edited the Law Review. 
He had prestigious clerkships at the 
DC 
Circuit 
for 
then-Judge 
Brett 
Kavanaugh and at the Supreme Court 
for then-Justice Anthony Kennedy. He 
learned at the elbows of legal giants. 
Then, he moved on to skilled perform-
ance in private practice, and then to 
distinguished scholarship at the Uni-
versity of Louisville Law School, with 
particular expertise in national secu-
rity, administrative law, and the sepa-
ration of powers. 
Indeed, it is an impressive record. As 
Kentucky’s secretary of State, Mike 
Adams, put it recently, ‘‘Judge Walker 
is more than just a [C.V.].’’ Hence, the 
outpouring of praise from his peers, 
colleagues, and neighbors in Kentucky 
who know him well. One hundred Ken-
tucky lawyers, many of whom have 
practiced before Judge Walker in the 
district court, wrote to praise his 
‘‘courage to apply precedent faith-
fully.’’ Sixteen State attorneys general 
wrote to share their confidence in 
Judge Walker’s ability to ‘‘weigh the 
facts against the law as it is written 
. . . not as he wishes it to be.’’ 
I am confident our colleagues on the 
committee will find that this nominee 
possesses a generational legal mind, a 
kind heart, and total judicial impar-
tiality. 
President 
Trump 
made 
an 
out-
standing choice when he asked this 
Kentuckian to take his public service 
to the next level. I am confident Judge 
Walker will not disappoint. I urge the 
committee to approve his nomination. 
I look forward to voting to confirm 
him soon here on the Senate floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF JUSTIN WALKER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Senate is here, open for business. The 
janitors and food service workers, po-
lice officers, and all the staff who oper-
ate the floor are here. They are all 
here. Capitol Police are doing their 
usual excellent job. 
The Republican leader called us back 
despite the obvious health risks, but 
we are ready to do the business our 
country demands. So there is a ques-
tion that looms: Why isn’t the Senate 
focused on responding to the COVID–19 
pandemic? There hasn’t been a single 
vote here on the Senate floor related to 
coronavirus—not even a nominee re-
lated to coronavirus. 
Rather than focusing on COVID–19 
with laser-like intensity, the Senate 
Judiciary Committee today will waste 
precious time on the nomination of 
Leader MCCONNELL’s protegee, Justin 
Walker, to serve on the DC Court of 
Appeals, the second most powerful 
court in the country. 
Mr. Walker is a 37-year-old Fed-
eralist Society disciple who has more 
experience as a cable news commen-
tator than he does trying cases in 
court. Mr. Walker’s qualifications pale 
in comparison to those of previous 
nominees to the DC Circuit—Democrat 
and Republican. Nominees by Demo-
cratic Presidents and Republican Presi-
dents all were deeply steeped in the 
law—just about every one—and here we 
have this? 
What Leader MCCONNELL is doing to 
the courts is nothing short of disgrace-
ful. The judges currently sitting on the 
second highest court in the land had 
decades 
of 
experience 
in 
Supreme 
Court advocacy, appellate work, crimi-
nal law, private practice, academia, 
and so on, prior to their nominations. 
Mr. Walker has been a district court 
judge for less than a year—less than a 
year. He had no trial experience prior 
to that. 
Inexperience aside, bad enough as 
that is, Walker’s views are way out of 
the mainstream. In 2018, he described 
Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion uphold-
ing our healthcare law as ‘‘indefen-
sible’’ and ‘‘catastrophic.’’ Meanwhile, 
he praised a dissenting opinion by 
then-Judge Kavanaugh as a ‘‘roadmap 
for the Supreme Court’’ to invalidate 
it. 
Every Republican who votes for this 
nominee, Mr. Walker, will be voting to 
dismantle the ACA and take millions 
of people’s healthcare away from them 
if his statements prove to be how he 
judges things, which seems very likely 
given previous experience of other 
nominees like this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2255 
May 6, 2020 
This week, legal briefs are due in the 
Supreme Court case that will deter-
mine the future of our healthcare law. 
In the midst of a global pandemic, at a 
time when our healthcare system has 
never been more important, Senate Re-
publicans are preparing to jam through 
a judge who believes it should all be 
crashing down. Tens of millions of peo-
ple would lose their health insurance, 
and protections for Americans with 
preexisting conditions would be elimi-
nated. 
Mr. Walker’s nomination would be 
controversial in normal times, to say 
the least—less experience in the court 
than on TV. During this public health 
crisis, his nomination is nothing short 
of a disgrace. The Senate should be fo-
cused on helping the country—hos-
pitals 
and 
doctors, 
nurses 
and 
healthcare workers, essential employ-
ees and small businesses and families 
suffering from huge financial hardship. 
There are millions of newly unem-
ployed Americans, but the only jobs 
issue the Republican majority seems to 
be focused on this week is the jobs of 
rightwing judges who wish to dis-
mantle healthcare at a time when 
healthcare is needed more than ever. 
Let me say that again. There are mil-
lions of newly unemployed Americans, 
but in the Senate, the Republican ma-
jority is spending time giving jobs to 
rightwing judges. 
Now, let’s get back to what matters. 
Democrats are focused on helping 
workers, small businesses, and Amer-
ican families. In times of crisis and 
economic 
hardship, 
these 
average 
Americans, working people—they take 
it on the chin. That is where our focus 
needs to be—not on legal immunity for 
big corporations, not on big oil or gas 
companies, not on juicing the markets. 
The focus should be on average folks. 
That is who all of us in Congress 
should be focused on helping right now. 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
Now, on the administration, Congress 
can only do so much. I have actually 
been very proud of how both parties 
have come together over the past few 
months to pass historic legislation 96 
to nothing—96 to nothing—with a great 
deal of input and improvement by the 
Democratic minority. But to make this 
legislation work, we need a competent, 
steady, focused administration to not 
only implement our laws but coordi-
nate our national response. 
It is no secret that the Trump admin-
istration has been anything but fo-
cused, anything but steady, anything 
but competent. President Trump seems 
to spend more time deflecting blame, 
attacking others, pushing quack medi-
cines, and hiding from the truth than 
he does actually leading our Nation’s 
response to this crisis. 
Last night, in an interview on ABC 
News, the President said that his fail-
ure to prepare our national stockpiles 
with medical equipment was because 
‘‘he had a lot of other things going on.’’ 
The national stockpile for the vital 
PPE that our frontline workers need 
and other materials—the President 
failed to prepare our stockpiles with 
this equipment because he had a lot of 
other things going on? That is a Presi-
dent? 
Vice President PENCE yesterday con-
firmed that the White House was wind-
ing down its Coronavirus Task Force 
long before the disease has been con-
tained, waving the white flag of sur-
render to COVID–19 long before the 
battle is over. 
A report in today’s New York Times 
details the failures of the administra-
tion and Mr. Kushner in particular to 
procure critical supplies at a time 
when we lack masks, gloves, and other 
protective equipment. Instead of ap-
pointing a military person with experi-
ence in command and control, as I sug-
gested, Mr. Kushner recruited a team 
of consultants who had ‘‘little to no ex-
perience with government procurement 
procedures or medical equipment.’’ 
Now we are reading reports of a whis-
tleblower from the Department of 
Health and Human Services who re-
ports that there was ‘‘pressure from 
HHS leadership to ignore scientific 
merit and expert recommendations and 
instead to award lucrative contracts 
based on political connections and cro-
nyism.’’ This whistleblower is sched-
uled to appear before a House com-
mittee next week. This whistleblower 
should come before the Senate as well. 
Senators have many questions to ask 
him. I believe Senators on both sides of 
the aisle would have those questions. 
So this was and is a time when the 
American people need the executive 
branch to lead a coordinated response 
to this evil virus, to listen to medical 
experts, to heed their advice, to respect 
and listen to science, but President 
Trump seems unwilling and unable to 
handle the truth, and it is hurting our 
country each and every day. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL NURSES WEEK 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today is 
the first day of National Nurses Week— 
an annual commemoration each May 
celebrating 
the 
contributions 
of 
nurses—so today seemed like a fitting 
day to come down to the floor and talk 
about the contributions of nurses and 
other essential workers over the past 
couple of months. 
When we think about heroism, we 
tend to think of striking actions that 
take place in extreme circumstances— 
running into burning buildings, jump-
ing onto a grenade to save a fellow sol-
dier, racing out under fire to rescue a 
wounded comrade. And it is right that 
when we think of heroism, we think of 
such acts—acts of superhuman cour-
age, generosity, and self-sacrifice. 
The past couple of months have also 
reminded us of another kind of her-
oism—the quiet heroism of doing one’s 
duty, of getting up and going to work 
and doing your job day after day in dif-
ficult circumstances, even when you 
are tired, even when you are scared, 
even when you know that doing your 
job could place you in danger. We have 
seen a lot of that heroism over the past 
couple of months. 
A lot of Americans have been able to 
telework during the coronavirus crisis, 
but many, many more have had to go 
out and do the work that can’t be done 
from home: police officers, first re-
sponders, pharmacists, grocery store 
employees, farmers and ranchers, food 
supply workers, cleaning personnel, 
bank employees, utility workers, deliv-
ery drivers, and most of all, doctors 
and nurses. 
Over the past few weeks, we have 
come to realize how much we rely on 
these individuals and that society 
couldn’t operate without them. All the 
food in the world won’t do us any good 
if it doesn’t make it to grocery store 
shelves. That prescription from the 
doctor for lifesaving blood pressure 
medication is useless without a phar-
macist to dispense the drug. We tend to 
take our utilities for granted, but what 
would we do during this crisis if no one 
was picking up our trash or making 
sure that the water keeps running and 
the electricity keeps flowing? 
Sometimes heroism looks like run-
ning into a burning building, and some-
times it looks like putting on a mask 
and gloves and stocking the shelves 
with bread and pasta and cereal. 
I want to say a special word about 
medical personnel. Of all the essential 
workers who have gotten up and gotten 
on with their duty in these days of the 
pandemic, medical personnel have dis-
played a special courage. They have 
been on the frontlines of this battle, 
the ones directly confronting the dis-
ease. Every day when they go to work, 
they go to work knowing that day 
could be the day they catch the virus 
from a sick patient, but they go to 
work anyway. They have read about 
and sometimes seen colleagues die 
from the disease. At times, they have 
lacked adequate protective equipment, 
but they have gone to work anyway. 
Those nurses we are celebrating this 
week have worked 12-hour shifts pro-
viding medical care in a high-stress en-
vironment and have still found time to 
sit with and comfort patients. I have 
read more than one story about nurses 
making sure coronavirus patients sepa-
rated from family and friends don’t die 
alone. 
To our Nation’s doctors and nurses 
and other medical personnel: Thank 
you. We are so grateful for your cour-
age and for your sacrifice. 
Before I close, I want to say a special 
thank-you to the essential workers 
around the Capitol Complex here in 
Washington. 
While Senators have been able to do 
aspects of our job remotely, we have

also had to be here in the Capitol to do 
the critical work of responding to the 
crisis, and we simply couldn’t be here 
without the contributions of a number 
of individuals: the men and women of 
the Capitol Police, the cleaning staff, 
the food service workers, the mainte-
nance technicians and other support 
staff, the staffers who have to be in the 
office for the Senate to be able to oper-
ate, and the staffers right here on the 
floor—the doorkeepers and cloakroom 
staff and individuals from the Offices 
of the Secretary and the Parliamen-
tarian. 
I know these are stressful days to be 
coming to work. I know you have been 
asked to exceed your normal duties. I 
am incredibly grateful and I know that 
all of my colleagues are incredibly 
grateful for everything you have done 
to keep the Senate operating safely. It 
is because of you that we are able to 
get keeping our work done for the 
American people. 
Sooner or later, we are going to get 
through this pandemic and life will re-
turn to something resembling normal, 
but I hope we will still remember to be 
grateful for the people who have kept 
our society running during this crisis, 
who have shown us, in a difficult and 
challenging time, how to get up every 
day and do our duty.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF WILLIAM R. EVANINA 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to 
oppose the confirmation of William 
Evanina, whom we will be voting on 
shortly. Because of his failure to pro-
tect whistleblowers, leading whistle-
blower protection organizations sup-
port the opposition to Mr. Evanina’s 
confirmation. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
statements of two organizations, true 
advocates of whistleblower rights at 
this crucial time, be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Government Accountability 
Project, May 6, 2020] 
SENATOR
WYDEN
OPPOSES
SENIOR
INTEL-
LIGENCE OFFICIAL’S NOMINATION OVER WHIS-
TLEBLOWERS 
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Ron Wyden 
(D–OR) opposed William Evanina’s nomina-
tion to serve as the Senate-confirmed Direc-
tor of the National Counterintelligence and 
Security Center (NCSC). Sen. Wyden’s oppo-
sition comes days after Senator Charles 
Grassley (R–IA) lifted his 2018 hold on Mr. 
Evanina, 
placed 
in 
part 
because 
‘‘Mr. 
Evanina was responsible for developing poli-
cies and procedures to address retaliatory se-
curity clearance actions’’ taken against 
whistleblowers. Mr. Evanina has yet to 
produce those policies and procedures, leav-
ing government investigators with little 
guidance. 
Government Accountability Project’s Na-
tional Security Analyst Irvin McCullough 
said, 
‘‘Losing your security clearance means los-
ing your livelihood for many Intelligence 
Community employees. These folks’ whistle-
blowing protections were specifically de-
signed to give special care to whistleblowers 
whose security clearances are revoked in re-
taliation for making protected disclosures. 
However, the Director of National Intel-
ligence never implemented uniform policies 
and procedures for these whistleblowers, 
meaning agencies can act as their own 
fiefdoms 
when 
adjudicating 
these 
com-
plaints. While a whistleblower at the CIA has 
the same rights as a whistleblower at the 
NSA, one may find it much harder to enforce 
their rights simply because their agency is 
free to apply harsher standards than the 
other. That is unacceptable. Bill Evanina 
was directed to issue universal guidance for 
all agencies to follow when investigating 
these types of retaliation complaints, but he 
hasn’t done it. While Mr. Evanina is a dedi-
cated public servant who has contributed 
greatly to our country’s national security, 
this is his job and he needs to do it. We 
thank Senator Wyden for taking a stand to 
protect whistleblowers and ensure account-
ability inside the Intelligence Community.’’ 
Contact: Andrew Harman, Communica-
tions Director. 
STATEMENT FROM LIZ HEMPOWICZ, DIRECTOR 
OF PUBLIC POLICY, PROJECT ON GOVERN-
MENT OVERSIGHT 
‘‘POGO commends Senator Wyden for 
standing up for whistleblowers by refusing to 
confirm Mr. Evanina until this critical issue 
is resolved. Any security clearance action 
must be based on the national interests of 
our country, not personal bias or retaliation. 
Retaliatory security clearance actions un-
dermine the security clearance process, this 
is why Congress made it unlawful to retali-
ate against a whistleblower by restricting 
their access to classified information. ODNI 
charged Mr. Evanina’s office with the cre-
ation of uniform guidance for investigating 
retaliatory actions, but he has failed to fulfil 
that mandate even after several years. 
Thank you to Senator Wyden for standing up 
for whistleblowers and their right to a fair 
and equal investigation.’’ 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is cur-
rently open season on whistleblowers 
under the Trump administration. Don-
ald Trump and those around him have 
made it clear that anyone who speaks 
up 
about 
waste, 
fraud, 
abuse, 
or 
lawbreaking can be punished. If you 
are a whistleblower under the Trump 
administration, Donald Trump himself 
and his echo chamber will publicly call 
you a liar. They will threaten to make 
your name public, even at the cost of 
your physical security. They will pre-
vent your complaints from getting to 
the Congress, and they will fire the in-
spectors general who investigate your 
complaints. 
Now, more than ever, courageous 
whistleblowers deserve leaders who are 
going to protect them, defend them, 
and vigorously advocate and work for 
them. They deserve leaders who are 
going to stand up to Donald Trump and 
anybody else who tries to punish those 
who are going to speak truth—truth, 
especially, to those in power. 
I am rising today, taking this time of 
the Senate, to speak on behalf of whis-
tleblowers who feel under siege right 
now. I am on the floor to oppose the 
confirmation 
of 
William 
Evanina’s 
track record of inaction and why he 
should not be the Director of the Na-
tional Counterintelligence and Secu-
rity Center. 
The fact is that Mr. Evanina has 
failed, repeatedly, the key test on pro-
tecting whistleblower rights. Specifi-
cally, he failed to enact whistleblower 
protections that the Congress required 
in 2014. Think about that—all those 
years to get the job done and he didn’t 
do it. That is a 6-year track record of 
letting down whistleblowers and failing 
to follow the law. 
Today, Congress ought to stand up 
for whistleblowers, protect our democ-
racy, and the rule of law. And when 
Congress does act and pass whistle-
blowers’ protection legislation the way 
this body did in 2014, the Congress must 
not reward those who ignore the whis-
tleblower protection laws. Here, you 
have a case of exactly that, refusal to 
implement it for almost 6 years, and 
the person we are discussing with that 
track record of not being there for 
whistleblowers at a crucial time is 
being considered for a job promotion in 
the Senate. 
I want to unpack, for a few minutes, 
what the world looks like now to a po-
tential whistleblower in today’s intel-
ligence community. One of the biggest 
threats faced by whistleblowers who 
work with classified information is 
that their bosses are going to retaliate 
against them by revoking their secu-
rity clearances. Without clearances, 
they can’t do their jobs, their liveli-
hoods are ruined, and their families 
suffer. That threat has a chilling effect 
on potential whistleblowers and makes 
it less likely that abuses are going to 
be investigated and brought to light. 
The Congress has cared about this for 
years. It is why, in 2014, the Congress 
passed legislation specifically prohib-
iting the revocation of security clear-
ances as a form of retaliation against 
whistleblowers. 
Here is what the questions were. 
What happens if a whistleblower’s boss 
simply insists that they revoked the 
clearance for some other reason? What 
if they say it wasn’t retaliation for 
being a whistleblower? Does the whis-
tleblower have any recourse? Is there 
an appeals process? Or are whistle-
blowers, who stick their neck out to re-
port waste, fraud, and abuse, just out 
of luck? 
The Congress then stood with whis-
tleblowers. In that same 2014 law, Con-
gress required the Director of National 
Intelligence, in consultation with the 
Attorney General and the Secretary of 
Defense, to develop and implement 
policies and practices to make that ap-
peals process for whistleblowers a re-
ality. In other words, the Congress rec-
ognized that if whistleblowers were 
truly going to be protected from retal-
iation, there had to be a meaningful 
process for them to defend themselves 
against agencies that always have all 
the power and always have an obvious 
incentive to silence and remove those 
who speak up about abuses. 
This important law was passed by 
Congress in July 2014. As of that day in 
2014, the Director of National Intel-
ligence should have been drafting those

policies, but they didn’t do it in 2014, or 
in 2015, or in 2016, or in 2017, or 2018, or 
2019—all those years of inaction—and 
certainly they haven’t done it in 2020, 
especially because of the pandemic, be-
cause this is a crucial time when whis-
tleblower protection is needed, now 
more than ever, because we need those 
folks to be speaking truth to policy-
makers. 
I ask the Senate: Who is at the helm 
every single one of those years of inac-
tion? The person the Senate is think-
ing about promoting today, William 
Evanina. Six years have passed, and 
Mr. Evanina has not produced those 
whistleblower protection policies re-
quired by law. 
During that time, there had been five 
Directors of National Intelligence. The 
Congress made the Director of the 
NCSC a Senate-confirmed position. Mr. 
Evanina kept his job, becoming both 
Acting Director and the nominee. 
Meanwhile, Congress reached out to 
ask: What is the story on these poli-
cies? Is anybody actually moving to 
protect the whistleblowers, as Congress 
required in 2014? 
I want to say it again. On Mr. 
Evanina’s watch, nothing happened in 
2014, nothing happened in 2015, nothing 
happened in 2016, and nothing happened 
in 2017, 2018, 2019, and not in 2020—no 
policies, lots of empty rhetoric and no 
policies. Without the actual policies, 
whistleblowers 
are 
vulnerable, 
and 
when they tell the truth and push for 
accountability, they suffer. 
Every day, Donald Trump steps up 
his attacks on whistleblowers, on in-
spectors general, and on the whole sys-
tem of accountability that has tradi-
tionally been bipartisan. Congress has 
pushed back, passing laws to protect 
whistleblowers, but the laws have to 
mean something for the sake of whis-
tleblowers and the rule of law. Con-
gress should not reward those who ig-
nore the law and leave whistleblowers 
vulnerable. That is what Mr. Evanina 
has done for 6 years. That is why I can-
not support his confirmation. He has 
defied the law and failed to protect 
whistleblowers. 
I am going to state the obvious. 
When the Congress passes a law, it has 
to be implemented. When Congress di-
rects the government to protect whis-
tleblowers, that is something that is 
priority business. In 2014, this body 
tried to protect whistleblowers. A law 
was passed. Mr. Evanina has ignored it 
all these years. That is just not accept-
able. 
Now, with Donald Trump and his ad-
ministration feeling free to publicly at-
tack whistleblowers again and again 
and conduct an unremitting assault on 
the entire whistleblower system, laws 
to protect them are especially impor-
tant to our democracy. Day after day, 
we see the costs of a campaign to si-
lence people who speak up about 
abuses. We see it in his efforts to cover 
up his failed, often corrupt, responses 
to the COVID–19 crisis. We see it across 
the board. 
Now is when this country needs offi-
cials who are going to demonstrate 
leadership, who are going to stand up 
for the brave and the people who are 
willing to put their neck out to report 
misconduct. Whistleblowers deserve it, 
and the country deserves it. 
Now, the last point I am going to 
make—my colleagues probably have 
heard it, and they are going to hear it, 
I believe, again—is that Mr. Evanina is 
going to promise once more, after 6 
years of empty promises, to complete 
these critical whistleblower protection 
policies. What I would ask Senators is 
this: Enough is enough, right? After 6 
years—6 years of unfulfilled promises— 
the Senate ought to say: The country 
deserves better. The country deserves 
action, and the country deserves real 
protection for whistleblowers. 
Mr. Evanina remains the Acting Di-
rector. I want him—even after he 
hasn’t done it for 6 years, I want him 
to complete those whistleblower pro-
tection policies. When they are com-
pleted and the law Congress passed is 
implemented, it seems to me that is 
the time for the Senate to discuss 
again whether Mr. Evanina should get 
a promotion. 
Now, last, I just want to come back 
to how I started. I am not the only one 
who feels this way. The country’s lead-
ing whistleblower organizations have 
made 
it 
clear 
they 
oppose 
Mr. 
Evanina’s confirmation due to his fail-
ure to produce policies. They include 
such organizations as the Government 
Accountability Project, the Project on 
Government Oversight, Whistleblower 
Aid, and National Security Counselors. 
It is not just one Member of the U.S. 
Senate who is here to say that it is 
time to finally ensure that these coura-
geous Americans, these patriots, who 
are willing to come forward when all 
the incentives in American Govern-
ment are to stay quiet, not put your-
self at risk, don’t put your career in 
jeopardy—when all the incentives are 
for them to stay quiet, in this country 
right now, we need them speaking 
truth more than ever before. I oppose 
this nomination because there is a 
long, long track record of not being 
willing to stand up for these coura-
geous whistleblowers, and I intend to 
vote against the nominee. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today in strong support of William 
Evanina to be the first Senate-con-
firmed Director of the National Coun-
terintelligence and Security Center, or 
NCSC. I believe Bill is an American pa-
triot and an American success story. 
He was raised in Peckville, PA, with 
very modest means. He was the first in 
his family to go to college. Prior to 
joining the FBI in 1996, his first job was 
with the General Services Administra-
tion in Philadelphia. Over his 24-year 
long career with the FBI, Bill inves-
tigated organized crime and violent 
crimes. He investigated the 9/11 ter-
rorist attacks, the anthrax attacks, 
and the Daniel Pearl kidnapping. Bill 
also led the counterespionage group at 
the Central Intelligence Agency. He 
earned a reputation as the consummate 
counterintelligence and security pro-
fessional, fiercely dedicated to the mis-
sion with unquestionable honor. 
Then, in June 2014, then-Director of 
National Intelligence, Jim Clapper— 
someone whom I know and respect very 
much—appointed Bill to serve as the 
Director of the NCSC. Many technical 
and 
complex 
activities 
fall 
under 
NCSC, including personnel security 
policy, information technology protec-
tion standards, CI cyber operations, 
supply chain risk management, threat 
awareness for the U.S. critical infra-
structure, and damage assessments 
from spies and unauthorized disclo-
sures. I have partnered, in my role as 
vice chairman, with Bill on many top-
ics, to include educating industry 
about the threats posed by China and 
reforming an antiquated personnel vet-
ting system. 
The Intelligence Authorization Act 
for fiscal year 2016 recognized the vital 
work that NCSC does and made the po-
sition subject to Presidential nomina-
tion and Senate confirmation. In Feb-
ruary 2018, President Trump nominated 
Bill to be the first Senate-confirmed 
Director. The Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee considered the nomination in 
May of 2018 and unanimously—unani-
mously, with some concerns from my 
colleague from Oregon, but unani-
mously—recommended his confirma-
tion to the full Senate. 
His nomination didn’t get taken up 
because a Member on the opposite side 
had a concern. We considered his nomi-
nation again in February 2019 in the 
new Congress, and, again, our com-
mittee voted unanimously in favor of 
his nomination. 
Unfortunately, over the last 2 years, 
despite universal recognition of Bill’s 
qualifications for the position, his 
nomination became entangled in unre-
lated matters. Despite the delay—and I 
think Bill had plenty of opportunities 
to leave the government—Bill stayed 
the course, committed to the mission 
above all else. 
Now, I share my colleague from Or-
egon’s concerns about whistleblowers. I 
have seen this administration and this 
White House’s disregard for whistle-
blowers. I tell you this: I believe I have 
Bill’s commitment that the matter of 
processing the procedures on whistle-
blower protections will be dealt with. I 
also feel extraordinarily strongly that 
at this moment in time, when there is 
not a single Senate-confirmed ap-
pointee in the whole Office of Director 
of National Intelligence, now more 
than ever, we need at least one career 
intelligence professional with a good 
record, 
confirmed 
by 
this 
Senate, 
standing guard over an operation that 
right now, unfortunately, seems to be 
directed too often by political ap-
pointees that, both, disregard protec-
tion for whistleblowers and, in my

mind, too often disregard protections 
for our whole intelligence community. 
With the fact that we have now got-
ten rid of the unrelated matters that 
were precluding Bill’s confirmation by 
my colleague on the majority, I think 
we deserve to give this nominee what 
he and the country deserves—a vote. 
And my hope is a very strong vote of 
confirmation so that we can send some-
one who, as a career professional, has a 
commitment to holding truth first and 
foremost above political interference. 
We need Bill Evanina confirmed in this 
position. 
I look forward to Mr. Evanina’s con-
firmation today so that he can con-
tinue addressing the many important 
counterintelligence and security chal-
lenges facing our Nation. 
I yield the floor.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, early 
last December or at least sometime 
later last year, people in Wuhan, 
China, began showing symptoms of 
what was at that time an unidentifi-
able respiratory disease in increasing 
numbers. We now know that virus as 
COVID–19, and it has completely up-
ended our way of life in the United 
States and around the globe. This virus 
has infected over 3.5 million people 
around the world and killed, tragically, 
over 68,000 people in the United States, 
and that includes over 900 incredible 
and great Coloradans, my home State. 
We certainly mourn with those fami-
lies who have lost loved ones, and we 
will keep fighting for a path forward as 
we get through this together. 
I want to commend in the strongest 
terms possible our frontline workers, 
whether it has been our first respond-
ers, our healthcare professionals, or 
those who have allowed us to continue 
to enjoy a safe and secure food supply; 
people in the essential businesses who 
each and every day don’t complain but 
go to work to help make sure our com-
munities can get back to work. The list 
of heroes in our communities, those 
who have given so much, goes on and 
on and on. 
I think it is important to recognize 
that 
as 
we 
have 
addressed 
the 
coronavirus challenge in this country— 
the measures we have taken, the steps 
that have been laid out by mayors and 
governors 
and 
the 
President—they 
have been to comply with guidances 
and health directives and to comply 
with the best science and scientists our 
country has, not out of fear of the 
coronavirus, not because people are 
afraid of COVID–19, but they have done 
it out of love—love for their commu-
nity; love for their parents and grand-
parents, whom they hope to keep safe 
and healthy; love for our country, to 
stop the spread and flatten the curve. 
So to all of our incredible healthcare 
workers, the frontline workers, essen-
tial workers, grocery store clerks and 
gas station workers, mechanics at farm 
equipment dealerships that have re-
mained open to keep tractors running 
during planting, to our ranchers and 
farmers who have kept our food supply 
flowing: Thank you. 
People everywhere across Colorado 
are hurting, obviously, because of this 
pandemic. I have heard numerous sto-
ries across our great State. I have held 
telephone townhalls in every congres-
sional district in Colorado, speaking 
directly with Coloradans who have lost 
their jobs, who are unsure about how 
they will feed their family, and who 
have endless questions about what the 
future holds for them. 
I have heard from restaurant workers 
in Denver who were laid off when their 
restaurant closed. I have heard from 
restaurant owners who have done ev-
erything they can to keep their res-
taurant workers employed—preparing 
meals and providing them to the hun-
gry and the homeless. 
A small business owner in Monu-
ment, CO, shared with me how difficult 
it was to lay off 35 dedicated staff 
members but not having a choice. 
I have talked to businesses in El Paso 
County near Colorado Springs who 
used the last prepaid minutes on a cell 
phone to participate in our townhall to 
try to figure out where they could get 
food. 
I have talked to elderly Coloradans 
who were afraid to go to the grocery 
store because they didn’t know if they 
had special hours. They had an under-
lying condition, and they didn’t know 
if they could go safely. Our staff was 
able to help this person get the gro-
ceries they needed and the disinfectant 
they had requested and leave some in-
formation about the special hours that 
grocery stores around the town were 
holding for people who needed a little 
bit 
more 
social 
distancing—more 
space, more time, a safer environment 
to go out. 
But the effects of the coronavirus 
aren’t because somebody intentionally 
decided to hurt our economy, but they 
are hurting because of the necessary 
public health actions their government 
has taken. It is in large part the gov-
ernment’s responsibility to help get 
them through this because it was the 
government that said to them: Stay at 
home. Close your doors. Don’t go to 
work. 
It is our responsibility to provide the 
help that our economy needs to get

moving again, to get people back to 
work, because it was the advice of gov-
ernments, from the local levels to the 
Federal level, that said: These are the 
things you need to do to stop the 
spread and flatten the curve. 
Throughout this entire health epi-
demic, I have approached it with a 
three-prong strategy. Throughout this 
process, this three-prong strategy has 
been the focus I have used to approach 
what we as a country must do to get 
through. These are not steps that 
should be taken one at a time. You 
don’t accomplish step 1 and then at-
tempt to accomplish step 2 and then 
maybe get to step 3. These are things 
that need to be done all at the same 
time as we move on our path to recov-
ery. 
First, we must obviously address the 
immediate health crisis. The second 
prong is, we must make sure we are 
providing real-time assistance to real 
individuals who are really hurting 
across the State of Colorado and the 
country. The third prong is to make 
sure that we are supporting our busi-
nesses through this crisis, to make 
sure that when the health emergency is 
over, we have an economy that is able 
to snap back and run strong. 
These steps have to be done all at the 
same time—not step 1, then 2, then 3— 
but the first prong, the steps taken to 
flatten the curve and stop the spread, 
has been absolutely critical and will 
continue to be critical. 
Congress has taken many steps to 
support the health response, including 
$175 billion to support healthcare pro-
viders, $17 billion to the Strategic Na-
tional Stockpile for medical equipment 
and supplies, and a recent infusion of 
$25 billion to support testing, including 
dedicated 
funding 
for 
States 
and 
Tribes. We have also spent money to 
support scientists as they rapidly de-
veloped and produced new testing tech-
nologies and worked to get them to the 
market as quickly as possible. But it is 
going back to that bravery of our 
frontline healthcare workers, our first 
responders, our public health experts, 
as well as the innovation of our sci-
entists who have served as beacons of 
light during this difficult time and will 
help us get through this health emer-
gency. 
On prong 2, providing individuals 
with the assistance they need, we have 
continued to do that and must con-
tinue to do that to address this health 
emergency because when we started 
the very first steps, we said to every 
American: Please stay home. Figure 
out how to socially distance. 
As a result, unemployment claims 
have skyrocketed to record numbers as 
Americans grappled with work reduc-
tions, job loss, and overall changes to 
our daily lives. 
It is important that Congress acted 
quickly to provide individuals with im-
mediate assistance. In the CARES Act, 
we provided direct individual assist-
ance to millions of individuals and 
married couples across the State and 
across the country. We allowed Federal 
student loan borrowers to defer pay-
ments for 6 months without interest or 
penalties. We established a temporary 
Pandemic Unemployment Assistance 
Program for those who are self-em-
ployed 
or 
independent 
contractors 
whose livelihoods have been impacted 
by the pandemic—people who otherwise 
might not have had a place to go. 
One consistent message I have heard 
from countless Coloradans as I have 
spoken with them during the pandemic 
is that they appreciate our bipartisan 
efforts. It is beyond that. It is not sim-
ply a bipartisan effort where Repub-
licans and Democrats are working to-
gether; it is actually nonpartisan be-
cause Republicans and Democrats real-
ize there is no reason to bear that man-
tle of ‘‘party’’ because so many people 
are hurting, and we know what needs 
to be done for the country to work to-
gether, to be nonpartisan, and to pro-
vide the relief real individuals need in 
real time. 
We have to keep fighting in this non-
partisan way and this bipartisan way 
to make testing more widely available, 
to support State and local govern-
ments, to advocate for frontline and es-
sential workers, and to set up our econ-
omy to return as strong as it was be-
fore the pandemic. Thank goodness our 
economy was as strong as it was when 
we went into this. Imagine where we 
would be if we had a weak or struggling 
economy as we entered the health 
emergency. 
Prong 3 requires support for busi-
nesses. The economic relief that was 
provided through the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program under the CARES Act 
continues to be an essential tool for 
our 
small 
businesses 
and 
families 
across all four corners of Colorado. 
Over $10 billion in round 1 and round 2 
of the Paycheck Protection Program 
has been delivered to keep people on 
the payroll in Colorado. The Paycheck 
Protection Program was created to 
keep employees on the payroll and to 
help keep bills paid so that workers 
can keep their jobs, salaries, and bene-
fits—they can keep them—and so small 
businesses can hit the ground running 
when they are able to resume oper-
ations. Think about the millions of 
small businesses in our country respon-
sible for over $6 trillion in salary every 
year in this country. 
We often talk about small businesses 
being the backbone, the foundation, 
and the bedrock of our economy, and it 
is absolutely true. Small businesses 
employ nearly half of all American 
workers, and they make up 99.5 percent 
of all Colorado businesses, employing 
more than 1.1 million Coloradans. 
Because of clarifications to the pro-
gram I fought for, just last week I 
heard from three rural hospitals in Col-
orado that received Paycheck Protec-
tion Program loans through their local 
community bank. They were within a 
matter of a week or weeks of having to 
lay off employees and in some cases, 
shut down. The access to the Paycheck 
Protection Program was an absolute 
game changer for these critical and 
vital rural hospitals. Now these hos-
pitals can continue to provide both 
critical healthcare services to their 
communities and jobs for their employ-
ees, and in many communities, these 
rural hospitals are the largest em-
ployer in that community. 
These actions and programs are es-
sential cornerstones to our recovery, 
but we must finish laying the founda-
tion to ensure our economy snaps back 
and runs strong. While governments 
can allow businesses to open, the 
American people simply won’t return— 
they won’t fully return to the economy 
until they have confidence that the 
virus is under control. 
The first step to tackling any prob-
lem, of course, is seeing it, and that is 
especially true with COVID–19. How do 
we see it? Through widespread testing. 
Widespread testing is key to seeing the 
bigger picture in the fight against this 
virus. Our country’s well-being both 
medically and financially relies on our 
ability to see where the illness is and 
where it is not and where it is spread-
ing and where it is declining. That, in 
turn, depends on our ability to ramp up 
testing capacity. 
Rapid testing for COVID–19 and fur-
ther research into the benefits, applica-
tions, and development of that body of 
testing will help show which Colo-
radans have been exposed to COVID–19 
and the percentage of our population 
that has already recovered. This will 
better inform local schools, businesses, 
and governments as they make their 
own determinations about the path for-
ward. It will help provide peace of mind 
for Coloradans as they start to visit 
their families, reschedule doctors’ ap-
pointments for routine preventative 
services, and return to their jobs. It 
will also help States and local health 
departments decide what type of other 
responsive measures are necessary. 
My approach to this pandemic has 
been an all-hands-on-deck approach. 
When the Governor calls me and says 
our State needs more tests, more 
masks, or more equipment, I get to 
work fighting to find that assistance. 
Working together with the Governor, 
leaders at the Federal level, and our al-
lies abroad, we have been able to secure 
hundreds of thousands of masks and 
tests for our State, and we are working 
around the clock for more. 
Without effective widespread testing 
and a corresponding strategy that 
leverages and improves public health 
infrastructure to support monitoring, 
we cannot have a real-time response to 
the virus. Rapid testing and the ability 
of public health departments to inform 
individuals with positive cases quickly 
so they can take appropriate action 
and further prevent the spread is crit-
ical to making sure our entire economy 
is not forced to shut down in the fu-
ture. 
The dollars we have provided through 
various phases of action as it relates to 
the health emergency will help provide

that testing to help mobilize new test-
ing, to invent the kind of testing we 
need—an antigen-based test, an anti-
bodies test—the opportunities we have 
to rapidly let the people of this coun-
try know what is happening, what is 
not happening, and how we should tai-
lor our public policies to fit the spread 
of the virus and the decline of the virus 
and the reopening of our economy. 
We need a test that is so ubiquitous 
that people can buy a Big Gulp at 7– 
Eleven and buy a COVID–19 test and 
keep it in their car or keep it in their 
first aid kit so that if they wake up in 
the morning with a sore throat, they 
can test and they can have the actual 
results. Instead of shutting down a 
household or a community or a coun-
try, we can get the results to imple-
ment better public policies then and 
there. 
Congress must also make sure that 
the Paycheck Protection Program con-
tinues to be funded and improved 
where needed to better support Amer-
ica’s small businesses and the employ-
ees they are able to keep on the payroll 
as a result. We must make the program 
flexible enough to be effective, and we 
must make the rules so clear—so 
clear—that people will be competent 
that they can use it. 
I have seen the headlines about big 
businesses taking this money when 
they might not really need it, but I 
have also talked to 15-employee compa-
nies that have needed $30,000 or $40,000 
to pay their workers and that are now 
terrified of crossing Federal prosecu-
tors. 
I heard from a Coloradan I have 
known my entire life who is working 
with her son’s business. This is an es-
sential business that has remained 
open because of the role they play in 
our food supply. They went to the 
bank, and they got a loan under the 
Paycheck Protection Program. They 
were very excited that they would be 
able to keep their doors open, and then 
they received a letter that said: Hey, 
are you sure you needed this loan? 
Maybe you didn’t. Now they don’t 
know whether they should keep it. 
They are terrified to use it. 
While we have to make sure our pro-
grams aren’t abused, we also have to 
make sure we don’t create a chilling ef-
fect on businesses that truly need it. I 
understand the need to be careful 
about who gets this money, but when 
we are scaring businesses that we all 
agree need assistance the most, maybe 
things have gone too far and Congress 
is no longer helping. 
Congress should act to make rules 
that are clear. We should help guide 
those rules to be clear and bring con-
fidence to the program to make sure 
that people can be at work, keep their 
jobs, and keep their benefits. 
When the foundation is secure and we 
have this foundation secure, we should 
then explore the immediate opportuni-
ties for economic activity and employ-
ment—the opportunities that will ben-
efit every American and create the 
conditions for a quicker recovery. 
Until the American consumer is fully 
back, with confidence in our economy, 
we need to look for ways to fill the gap. 
We have long talked about the need 
to refurbish our infrastructure. Now is 
the time to do it. 
This health crisis has laid bare the 
cyber desert that exists in many of our 
rural communities. We should make a 
concentrated effort to make rural 
broadband a reality. 
We should fully and permanently 
fund the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund and put funding towards our de-
ferred maintenance projects across our 
Federal lands that we all cherish so 
much. That will create immediate jobs 
building roads and maintaining trails 
and creating the kinds of job opportu-
nities that many of our high mountain 
towns desperately need as a result of 
this health emergency and now eco-
nomic emergency. 
I have introduced a bill that has the 
President’s support and both sides of 
the aisle, and certainly the ideas are 
supported across both Chambers of 
Congress—the Great American Out-
doors Act. Communities throughout 
the Nation would benefit, and these 
funds would help contribute to a strong 
and growing outdoor recreation econ-
omy—one of the largest drivers of our 
economy in Colorado and in many 
States. 
In short, we need to take some big 
and bold steps to make sure that our 
economy is back on track and to help 
accelerate it once again. We need these 
big steps because we have taken a hard 
shot in the last couple of months. 
We also need to support mental 
health efforts. Prior to the pandemic, 
70 percent of Colorado’s mental health 
need was unmet, and on average, one 
Coloradoan died by suicide every 7 
hours. Before COVID–19, I was working 
on a number of legislative efforts to 
improve mental health support, and 
COVID–19 has only underscored just 
how time-sensitive these matters are— 
particularly my legislation, the Na-
tional Suicide Hotline Designation Act. 
In a mental health emergency, it is 
almost impossible to remember the 
current 10-digit hotline. Sometimes 
there is more than one 10-digit hotline. 
So establishing 9–8–8 as a national sui-
cide prevention hotline will save lives 
and help more Americans in need to ac-
cess critical mental health support. 
S. 2661, the National Suicide Hotline 
Designation Act, is more than smart 
policy that will help save lives; it is a 
statement that our government recog-
nizes the crisis and is working across 
party lines to address it. Establishing 
9–8–8 as a national suicide prevention 
hotline will save lives and help more 
Americans who need access to critical 
mental health support. 
I have been proud to push for this 
three-digit hotline and funding for the 
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 
and I will keep fighting to make sui-
cide prevention services more acces-
sible. Let’s come together, and let’s get 
this done. 
Access to mental health care is espe-
cially important during this trying 
time filled with grief and uncertainty 
for so many people, and we must en-
sure we are doing everything we can to 
prevent these devastating outcomes 
from occurring. 
But no matter how bleak our situa-
tion looks, it is important to remember 
that America has faced its fair share of 
challenges. Together, we have per-
severed and persisted through world 
wars, economic disasters, the Sep-
tember 11 terrorist attacks, and much, 
much more. While this virus will not be 
the last challenge our country faces, 
we know that this, too, shall pass, and 
together, we will make it to the other 
side stronger than ever. I have faith 
and confidence in the American people 
and in our ability to pull together and 
to continue to meet this challenge 
head-on. Colorado has been that shin-
ing example of resiliency in so many 
instances, and it will continue to be. 
Over these last several months, I 
have spoken directly to countless Colo-
radans, all unsure of what the future 
holds, but they are certain we will get 
through this by looking up to that 
great Rocky Mountain horizon. Colo-
radans everywhere are stepping up and 
meeting this challenge in the spirit of 
our great country. They are donating 
food, they are donating personal pro-
tective equipment, and they are donat-
ing time, talents, and their blood. Indi-
viduals and businesses across Colorado 
and across the country are seeing needs 
and responding to those in need. 
To the brave healthcare providers 
fighting around the clock, the reliable 
farmers and ranchers working day in 
and day out to keep food on the table, 
and all the essential workers who con-
tinue to selflessly put themselves at 
risk to ensure others are taken care of 
first, I give my deepest thanks and 
praise. 
In Colorado, we have lost two first 
responders on the frontlines in the 
fight against COVID–19. 
Deputy Jeff Hopkins served in the El 
Paso County Sheriff’s Office, and he 
had been serving there since 2001. On 
April 1, he passed away from COVID–19 
at the age of 41—1 day after he was di-
agnosed with COVID–19. His death was 
determined to be a line-of-duty death, 
which is a reminder to all of us that 
our brave first responders are in harm’s 
way every day but especially during 
this pandemic. 
We also recently lost Paul Cary, who 
worked as a firefighter and paramedic 
in Aurora for more than 30 years. Paul 
was 66 years old, and he selflessly 
drove—selflessly 
drove—27 
hours 
straight to New York in an ambulance 
to help out in the battle against 
COVID–19. While there, he was tending 
to patients and transporting them to 
hospitals. After falling ill with the 
virus, Paul died on April 30. Coloradans 
lined the streets to give him a hero’s 
farewell. 
To Deputy Hopkins, to Paul Cary, 
and to the countless heroes like them

May 6, 2020 
who are risking their own lives for our 
health and safety every day, thank 
you. 
First responders and medical profes-
sionals all across our State continue to 
make countless sacrifices on our be-
half. 
The long hours and time away from 
family and loved ones, the undeniable 
mental toll this pandemic takes on 
those on the frontlines and the health 
risks—these sacrifices don’t go unno-
ticed. We must do everything we can to 
make sure the first responders of 
COVID–19 have the resources, the sup-
port, and the personal protective equip-
ment needed to fight this pandemic. 
We will never be able to fully show 
our 
deep 
appreciation 
for 
our 
healthcare providers, frontline employ-
ees, and first responders who are work-
ing to keep vital parts of our country 
moving. We have to do everything we 
can to try to make up what they have 
done for us in big ways and small ways 
every day. 
In Colorado, we don’t look back; we 
look forward. We look out across the 
Great Plains, the Great High Plains, up 
to that majestic Rocky Mountain hori-
zon for that next optimistic day. 
In the middle of the health emer-
gency, a couple of weeks ago, I received 
a letter in the mail, and it had a pair 
of pliers in this letter, and I really 
didn’t know what it was. It sat on my 
desk, and I opened it up not knowing 
what it was. 
I ask unanimous consent that I be al-
lowed to share an item on the floor 
that was sent to me during the health 
pandemic. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, in the 
letter, this pair of pliers came, and I 
opened it up, and here is what it said: 
Senator GARDNER, I want to thank you and 
everyone at your office profusely for every-
thing that you have done for me. You have 
allowed for me to continue receiving unin-
terrupted benefits and care for combat inju-
ries I have sustained while serving as an Offi-
cer in the U.S. Army. 
In 2014, you came to visit me in the Ward 
of Walter Reed, while I was still bandaged 
and pretty beat up, missing my dominant 
hand and looking overall pretty haggard. 
You told me a story about the Korfs (My 
Mom’s side) [of the family] in Yuma County. 
At this point, I realized who the let-
ter was from, and I remembered very 
clearly the story I had told this young 
soldier. 
You told me a story about the Korfs (My 
Mom’s side) in Yuma County walking into 
your family’s hardware store and stress-test-
ing pliers. 
It was a story I had received from my 
granddad about these two brothers who 
would come in years and years ago— 
decades ago. They would grab a pair of 
pliers on the parts counter, and they 
would squeeze them, and they were so 
strong that they would snap the pin in 
the pliers. I told him that story. 
He wrote in his letter: 
Apparently my ancestors wouldn’t buy a 
pair if they didn’t stand up to the grip of the 
man that I can only imagine was pretty 
strong in the arms. While I’m sure they only 
broke a few sets and got away with it by 
being [expletive], I’ve enclosed a pair as rec-
ompense. 
After you visited, I took that story with 
me. After 5 years as an amputee, I’ve been an 
Infantry Officer and I spent years training as 
a Special Forces Officer—the only amputee 
to ever pass Assessment and Selection. It’s 
been inspiring to grip this set of pliers and 
try to snap them. 
And then he wrote: 
Sometimes our tools break, sometimes it’s 
our fault, sometimes they’re not flat sturdy 
to begin with, sometimes these tools have 
just been used to the point of failure. Every 
time, though, what really matters is what we 
do once that tool is broken. We fix it, get a 
new one, or we improvise something better. 
Either way, we figure out how to finish the 
job, because people are depending on us to 
get it done. 
Carey G. DuVall, CPT U.S. Army, Ft. 
Bragg, NC. 
We face a tremendous challenge un-
like we have ever faced in our life-
times, and, while we are going to use 
every tool we have to help fix what has 
happened, we know that every one is 
not going to be perfect. But we have to 
keep trying because that is what the 
American people do every day. They 
make it work. They fight. They get 
back on their feet. We have to be in 
this fight with them. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I think 
all of us are in awe on a daily basis of 
those who we have a responsibility to 
serve. The people of Colorado, the peo-
ple of Texas, and the people of Con-
necticut are doing just absolutely ex-
traordinary things, and I hope that 
over the next several weeks we get to 
hear more of those stories. 
At the end of last week, I got a 
chance, with my Governor, to go down 
to a healthcare facility in Bridgeport, 
CT. It is a healthcare facility that has 
been designated to serve only COVID– 
19-positive patients. The nurses and 
staff came outside into the parking lot 
area to have a socially distanced, 
masked conversation with us. 
While they have struggles, and while 
they need help, they have a sense of 
mission about them that is impressive. 
They are working double shifts. They 
barely get to see their kids. They know 
that their lives are in danger every 
time they go into a facility where 
there are only patients who have tested 
positive for COVID, and yet they know 
they are doing something with their 
life today that they will be able to tell 
their kids and grandkids about. They 
are making a difference. 
I think about those individuals who 
aren’t a first responder, who aren’t a 
healthcare worker but have found a 
way to do heroic things just in their 
neighborhoods. 
Luciana Vera was already making a 
difference. She was a bilingual teacher 
in the Stamford, CT, public school sys-
tem, but she heard about a crisis that 
one of her students was having. One of 
her student’s mother had contracted 
the virus, had gone into a coma, but 
was pregnant and delivered a child 
while she was in a medically induced 
coma. Her husband also had the virus, 
as did one of her children. So do you 
know what Luciana did? Do you know 
what this teacher did? She took the 
baby into her home. While she taught 
her students online during the day, she 
warmed up bottles and fed that baby at 
night. 
Jerry Sicardi is 100 years old. He 
lives in Stratford, CT. Even at 100 
years old, he decided to get together 
with his daughter Judy and start mak-
ing masks. We all have these stories 
from our States, just folks who started 
sewing masks and giving them out to 
people who needed them. Jerry gave 
them out to his neighbors. He sent 
some to the Bridgeport Correctional 
Center. He gave them to former stu-
dents. Then, when folks learned that 
Jerry was pretty good at making 
masks, they would call, and he would 
make them on order. 
These are the stories that could, 
frankly, fill up the whole day from 
each one of our States. 
While 
my 
constituents 
in 
Con-
necticut, who are as generous as that, 
would have undertaken those actions 
regardless of the effectiveness of the 
response from their government, their 
actions are all the more important, 
given the failures of their Federal Gov-
ernment to do the right thing by them. 
I want to spend a few minutes today 
talking about the Trump administra-
tion’s response to the crisis that we are 
facing. If we are going to be here in 
Washington, I think it is important for 
us to talk about what is missing. 
There has been a lot of ink spent al-
ready criticizing the Trump adminis-
tration’s response to the crisis—that 
the strategy was wrong, the focus was 
in the wrong place, or that the level of 
activity wasn’t high enough. But I 
really think that this is the wrong par-
adigm. It is the wrong lens through 
which to have this discussion because 
the problem really isn’t that President 
Trump’s response to coronavirus has 
been ineffective. It is that he hasn’t re-
sponded at all. For all intents and pur-
poses, there has been no response to 
coronavirus from this administration. 
There have been press conferences. 
There is a social media presence, but 
they aren’t running a national re-
sponse. 
From the beginning, the response has 
been left to States, to cities, to coun-
ties, to hospitals, to school districts, to 
nursing homes, to shelters, to food 
banks, to charitable organizations— 
really, to every public-facing entity 
that 
isn’t 
the 
administration. 
We 
shouldn’t lose sight of how remarkable 
that is—that in the face of the most se-
rious national crisis since 2001, perhaps 
since Vietnam or World War II, the ad-
ministration has effectively chosen to 
stand down and let others lead. 
I know that sounds like hyperbole be-
cause there is a task force, right?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2262 
May 6, 2020 
There are press conferences on TV 
every day. But hear me out. 
At 
the 
beginning, 
the 
President 
didn’t do nothing. He fanned the 
flames. He called coronavirus in the 
early days a ‘‘hoax’’ perpetuated by his 
political opponents. He telegraphed to 
the country that this wasn’t something 
we needed to be prepared for because it 
was just going to go away, despite all 
the experts telling him differently. 
On 12 different occasions, he praised 
the Chinese response and said that 
President Xi was doing an excellent job 
responding to the crisis. He praised, 
specifically, their transparency. At a 
moment when the international com-
munity was trying to get into China to 
find out what they knew so that we 
could start developing vaccines and 
treatments, the chief apologist in those 
early days for the Chinese response was 
our own President. 
Arguably, the most significant action 
that the Trump administration under-
took—really, the only action that the 
President mentions to this day, when 
pressed for tangible things that he has 
done—was the set of travel restric-
tions. But public health experts told 
the President that the restrictions 
wouldn’t work, especially since they 
were filled with loopholes. We now 
know that 400,000 people ended up get-
ting into the United States from the 
countries that were subject to the re-
strictions list. The travel ban was feck-
less. It was a failure. And after that, 
the administration effectively gave up. 
They gave up. 
What could they have done? As the 
travel ban started to prove ineffective 
at stopping the virus and cases started 
to mount, what could they have done? 
Well, they could have decided to lead a 
national effort to make sure we have 
the supplies necessary to fight the 
virus. Members of Congress told the ad-
ministration early on that we needed 
to appropriate dollars to make sure 
that we had things like masks and 
gowns and ventilators. They could have 
created a national effort to ramp up 
domestic production of personal pro-
tective equipment. They didn’t do that. 
The administration could have come 
up with a national testing plan. They 
could have done an early assessment of 
how many tests were going to be need-
ed and taken control of the supply 
chain necessary to make those diag-
nostic machines and the cartridges 
that go inside them. They didn’t do 
that. 
They could have begun the work of 
building a national public health work-
force. Every expert told the adminis-
tration that it wasn’t just the ma-
chines and the equipment, that we 
were going to need public health work-
ers to do the testing, to then trace the 
spread of the disease, and to help sup-
port quarantines. They could have 
started to put together a plan to build 
that workforce at a national level or at 
least a plan to help States build that 
workforce. But they didn’t do that. 
They could have, early on, worked 
with States to create uniformed stand-
ards for school and business closings. 
This didn’t have to be left to States 
and municipalities and individual su-
perintendents. 
The 
administration 
could have chosen to lead on the ques-
tion of how and when we chose to close 
our economy and our school systems 
down, but they didn’t do that. 
They could have joined with other 
countries to jointly produce a vaccine. 
In fact, there was an entity set up at 
the beginning of the Trump adminis-
tration specifically for that purpose, 
the Coalition for Epidemic Prepared-
ness Innovations. They could have 
made an investment in that inter-
national organization after having re-
fused to join early on during the Presi-
dent’s term, but they didn’t do that. 
They could have increased aid for de-
veloping nations or refugee camps. 
They could have gone on the inter-
national 
offensive, 
like 
President 
Obama did during the Ebola epidemic, 
and made sure that we were helping 
every country beat the virus because, 
as we know, due to the failure of the 
travel restrictions, if you don’t stop it 
everywhere, you really are not stop-
ping it anywhere, but they didn’t do 
that. 
They could have made sure that ev-
erybody in this country had insurance. 
The Trump administration could have 
stopped pushing junk plans. They could 
have, at least temporarily, put on hold 
the lawsuit to try to end the Affordable 
Care Act and the 20 million who are in-
sured through it, but they didn’t do 
that. 
They could have worked to create a 
national commitment to make sure 
that every student has the ability to 
distance learn and has internet access, 
or they could have proposed a plan to 
ramp up special education funding to 
make sure they are protecting kids 
with disabilities during this crisis. 
They didn’t do that. 
Finally, they could have proposed 
any of the various programs that Con-
gress developed and passed: the PPP 
program, the State stabilization fund, 
the hospital relief fund, the national 
testing program fund. None of these 
were initiatives from President Trump. 
Early on, as negotiations were begin-
ning on these relief packages, the 
President’s only idea was a payroll tax 
cut. Frankly, it is still the President’s 
only idea. 
The President didn’t need to leave all 
of the legislative leadership to Con-
gress. He and his team could have laid 
out detailed new programs to combat 
the virus or to save the economy and 
pressed Congress to pass them, but 
they didn’t even do that. 
I am not saying there aren’t meet-
ings. I am not saying there aren’t press 
conferences. But my State, one of the 
hardest hit in the Nation, has had to 
effectively fend for itself. 
When I talk to State leaders, or hos-
pital executives, or food pantry direc-
tors, none of them talk to me about all 
of the help they are getting from the 
Trump 
administration. 
They 
talk 
about the programs that Congress has 
passed, but they don’t talk about any 
meaningful, impactful responses to 
this crisis run by the Trump adminis-
tration. Do you know why? Because 
they don’t exist, and even when the 
Trump 
administration 
tries 
to 
do 
something meaningful, they screw it 
up. 
Take, for instance, the much-her-
alded plan to reopen America. Now, 
that was a good idea, a serious set of 
guidelines for States to use to judge 
when the right time is to reopen. I may 
have quibbles with certain elements of 
that plan, but I thought they were gen-
erally on the right track, giving States 
some specific guidelines so that we can 
have some consistency across the coun-
try as to when States decide to reopen 
schools and businesses. 
The administration stuck with that 
plan for about a week, and now Presi-
dent Trump is calling on States to re-
open, regardless of whether any of the 
benchmarks have been met in his own 
plan. 
Now 
he 
is 
talking 
about 
healthcare workers and cafeteria work-
ers as warriors, apparently preparing 
them for a summer during which his 
experts tell him there will be 3,000 
coronavirus deaths a day because of 
these early reopenings. If that is true, 
the President’s so-called coronavirus 
warriors would be dying at a daily 
total 10 times that of the warriors who 
fought in World War II. 
Not all of this was avoidable. China, 
where the virus started, bears serious 
responsibility for the global spread, but 
the epidemic did not have to become 
the crisis of the magnitude we have 
witnessed today. 
A normal President would have been 
able to take steps early on and 
throughout that could have controlled 
the spread. Our President effectively 
chose to stand aside and leave 50 States 
and thousands of cities and hospitals to 
manage the response instead. They 
were left largely helpless, without sig-
nificant Federal support, competing 
against each other for scarce resources, 
and now our country is in desperate 
straits. So, once again, it is up to Con-
gress to lead. 
I agree with my friend from Colorado 
that there has been remarkable bipar-
tisan support in this body in order to 
fill the vacuum that has been created 
by the refusal of our President to lead, 
and so we will have to do it again. Let 
me leave my colleagues with a few sug-
gestions as to the path that we should 
take going forward to build upon those 
suggestions proffered by my colleague 
from Colorado. 
First and foremost, we have to admit 
what is true. The States and the cities 
are in charge of the response. The 
Trump administration is not. I have 
heard my colleagues talk about aid to 
States or municipalities that are fight-
ing the virus as a bailout. That is non-
sense. It is more accurate to talk about 
what the States and cities are doing as 
a bailout of the Federal Government. 
When the Trump administration re-
fused to run a national response, it was

the States, like mine, and cities, like 
those in my State, that stepped up to 
lead the response. All we are asking is 
that we share in the cost of the States’ 
and cities’ efforts to save lives. 
Second, our schools are going to be 
overwhelmed with need when they re-
open. I am one of the few parents of 
school-aged children, children who go 
to public school. My kids are lucky 
enough that they don’t have special 
learning needs, and they have two par-
ents who are able to telework from 
home and support their distance learn-
ing. But there are millions of kids who 
have learning disabilities, who have 
needs totally unmet during this time 
who are going to show back up at 
school way behind and in crisis. We 
need to appropriate money right now, 
especially for special education, so 
that school districts across the country 
can start to do planning now, this 
spring and this summer, so that there 
are supports around those kids when 
they show back up. Every kid is going 
to have to catch up. But especially for 
kids with serious learning disabilities, 
they are going to need extra help. And 
States that are going to have expended 
all of the money available to them to 
fight the virus and that have cratering 
revenues because of the shutdown of 
the economy are not going to be able 
to fund those special education needs 
themselves. It is going to have to be us. 
It is going to have to be us. So why 
wait until the fall? Let’s make a down-
payment on that assistance for kids 
with disabilities and do it now. 
Food banks in Connecticut are run-
ning dry. They are running dry. We 
need more support in the next bill for 
nutrition assistance. We have to start 
thinking creatively about how to make 
sure that everybody has access to food. 
Right now, if you are on a SNAP ben-
efit, you have to go to a grocery store. 
Well, those aren’t safe places for every-
body on SNAP benefits. Some of the 
corner bodegas have closed down. So 
the only place that might be open is a 
long way away. So restaurants can be a 
lifeline right now. Traditionally, we 
don’t allow you to use your SNAP ben-
efits in restaurants, but I think we 
should temporarily allow for that in 
the next package we pass. And guess 
what. That would be a win for people 
who are on assistance who need more 
food options. It would also be a win for 
restaurants that are looking for cus-
tomers. 
Fourth, we have to build that public 
health workforce. Again, States will 
not be able to afford it themselves. 
Every medical expert tells us that it is 
not just testing. It is tracing the con-
tacts that that individual had. It is 
quarantining those they had contact 
with. And that can’t be done just with 
an act. There have to be workers who 
help do that tracing, who help support 
the quarantine. We have to build that 
workforce. Again, there is just no con-
ceivable way that States can pay that 
by themselves. 
Then, lastly, we need to get back 
into the game internationally. It was a 
fallacy from the beginning to think 
that we can just shut our borders and 
protect ourselves. That is not how vi-
ruses work. In an interconnected econ-
omy today, there is no practical way to 
completely shut down your borders 
from individuals or products that move 
across international boundaries. 
We have offers right now to engage 
with our partners internationally on 
ways that could end up helping to save 
lives in the United States. I mentioned 
the Trump administration’s refusal to 
join CEPI, which is the international 
body working on a vaccine. Why? Why 
is Europe and Canada and Australia 
and Japan and Saudi Arabia and India 
all working jointly on a vaccine, and 
we are on the outside? It doesn’t mean 
that we would have to stop doing our 
own congressionally funded work to de-
velop a vaccine, but why not also join 
the international effort so that we are 
not on the outside if they develop that 
vaccine? An easy thing we can do in 
this next bill is make sure we are both 
working on a vaccine domestically but 
also working internationally. 
When this crisis is over and life has 
returned to relative normal, there will 
be a grave, serious accounting of how 
badly the Trump administration failed 
this Nation that it was sworn to pro-
tect. I am grateful for my colleagues 
stepping up time and again in a bipar-
tisan way to try to fill the gap created 
by the failure to lead by the executive 
branch. Hopefully, when we do that ac-
counting, it will allow us to learn les-
sons. For now, this Congress has to sol-
dier on and do our best to muster a 
Federal response that, if not for our ac-
tions, 
would 
be 
practically 
non-
existent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, like 
other Senators, around this time of the 
year, I am used to being with folks 
from home who are traveling to Wash-
ington, DC. Between spring break trips 
and industry fly-ins, spring is normally 
a very busy season here at the Capitol. 
I always look forward to seeing both 
new and familiar faces and spending 
time with my constituents and talking 
about the challenges they are facing 
and the changes they would like to see 
coming out of Congress. 
Yet, as we all know, this is not a typ-
ical springtime in Washington. Nor-
mally busy sidewalks and hallways are 
largely empty, as our constituents 
hunker down at home while we con-
tinue working to get them the help 
they need. Just as Texans have adopted 
new routines to meet social distancing 
requirements, so have I, as have all of 
us. 
I know I am not alone among my col-
leagues when I say that over the last 
few weeks, I have logged some serious 
hours on phone calls and video con-
ferences with folks across Texas. Actu-
ally, I have been a little bit surprised 
at how efficient it is in terms of reach-
ing large numbers of people, and I 
think it will probably change some of 
the ways we work here and some of the 
ways we act with our constituents here 
in the future. 
I spoke with those in the medical 
field about the ongoing challenges to 
our frontline healthcare workers, the 
progress toward developing a vaccine, 
antibody tests, and the like. 
I have talked with the Texas Farm 
Bureau, our farmers and ranchers, our 
grocery store workers, and our food 
bank employees about the need to 
make sure that all Texans can access 
the food they need, especially during a 
time like this. 
I have talked with mayors, county 
judges, and other leaders in our com-
munities about the work they are 
doing. 
I was listening to our friend and col-
league from Connecticut who believes 
that the response needs to be coming 
out of Washington and that we all need 
to simply fall in line according to the 
dictates of the national government. 
Well, it raises interesting questions 
about the Constitutional Convention 
and the agreement to have a Federal 
system, not a national system. We 
have sovereign States that have their 
own sphere of responsibility. Our cities 
and counties are best able, in my view, 
to respond to local conditions. 
Rather than a command and control 
response, what we have had in Texas 
and I dare say in most other places has 
been a collaborative approach. Work-
ing with the national government to 
provide the resources and some of the 
guidance is very important. But our 
Governors, who control the National 
Guard, which has come out to help do 
testing, help stock food banks, and 
help build temporary hospital facili-
ties, and our mayors and county judges 
and local officials have really done an 
outstanding job. I am very proud of the 
work they have done. We haven’t just 
taken orders on high from the Federal 
Government; we worked together, hand 
in glove, with the Federal Government. 
Of course, I talked to countless small 
business owners across our big cities 
and small towns and everywhere in be-
tween about the financial strain caused 
by the pandemic, and it is significant, 
to say the least. Many, of course, were 
forced to close their doors or dramati-
cally scale back their operations, and 
many have had to make hard decisions 
to stay afloat. 
I was just emailing with a friend of 
mine in Dallas who has ownership in a 
company that just declared chapter 11 
bankruptcy. Our small businesses are 
the heart and soul of our communities. 
They are our favorite locally owned 
restaurants; the florists we call upon 
on anniversaries, birthdays, and other 
holidays; the drycleaners, the barber-
shops, the gyms, the pharmacies—all 
the places we have been going for 
years. They feel like an extended part 
of our family. They are part of what 
make our communities unique, and 
they are a huge driver of our economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2264 
May 6, 2020 
In Texas and across the country, 
small businesses employ nearly 50 per-
cent of the local workforce. For many 
of these workers, the closures and can-
cellations 
brought 
on 
by 
the 
coronavirus have put their livelihoods 
in jeopardy, with many losing some or 
all of their income and many, their 
jobs entirely. 
As the Senate was working on our 
third response package back in March, 
we knew that without a serious invest-
ment in our small businesses, the re-
sult would be catastrophic. That is why 
we created the Paycheck Protection 
Program through the CARES Act to 
provide cash flow assistance for our 
small businesses. As we know, those 
low-interest loans can be used to cover 
everything from payroll, to supply 
chain disruptions, to rent or mortgage. 
And if the employers are able—I under-
line the word ‘‘able’’—if they are able 
to keep their employees on the payroll 
until June, then much of those loans 
can be turned into grants. 
During my calls and video con-
ferences with chambers of commerce 
and small business owners throughout 
Texas, I have been able to talk about 
the benefits of these loans and how to 
access them. Small Business Adminis-
tration staff have joined me on dozens 
of these calls to answer technical ques-
tions about the loan program and other 
types of assistance offered by the SBA, 
which has been really valuable and ap-
preciated by everyone. 
Small businesses in my State have 
jumped at the opportunity to take ad-
vantage of the PPP loans and start 
talking with their banks and gathering 
up paperwork and going through the 
formal application process. 
As we know now, it became quickly 
obvious how popular the PPP program 
was and that it would exceed the fund-
ing levels after 2 weeks. That indicates 
the kind of demand and the kind of 
need and that our response was actu-
ally hitting the target. But after 2 
weeks, the first $350 billion was ex-
hausted and depleted. From that first 
$350 billion, 135,000 small businesses in 
Texas received loans—more than any 
other State. That program brought ap-
proximately $28.5 billion to Texas 
small businesses and protected thou-
sands of jobs. 
Well, we know, after a little bit of 
jockeying back and forth with the 
House, Congress finally replenished the 
Paycheck Protection Program with an 
additional $320 billion, and that money 
is flying out the door as we speak. 
You don’t have to look far to see why 
this program is so popular. 
Valerie Gonzalez-Handly owns Deli-
cious Tamales in my hometown of San 
Antonio. Like other restaurants across 
the country, her business struggled as 
the stay-at-home orders were put in 
place. Delicious Tamales closed for 2 
weeks last month but was able to re-
open because of the $232,000 loan they 
received through the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program. All 38 employees re-
turned to work. Valerie called the Pay-
check 
Protection 
Program 
a 
‘‘life 
saver.’’ 
For patients at a clinic in Tyler, 
TX—another PPP loan recipient—these 
loans could be a literal life saver. Be-
thesda 
Health 
Clinic 
provides 
healthcare services to low-income and 
uninsured Texans in the Tyler area. 
The clinic doesn’t receive State or Fed-
eral funding, and one-third of their 
budget comes from the Hangers of Hope 
thrift stores they operate, which were 
forced to close. The clinic had to fur-
lough their employees in order to sur-
vive the financial squeeze but was able 
to take advantage of the Paycheck 
Protection Program. Krysti McWha is 
the chief financial and operations offi-
cer, and she said this has erased a lot 
of worry for the clinic and allowed the 
furloughed employees to return to 
work. It has also enabled them to con-
tinue to serve the public during a time 
of heightened healthcare concerns. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
has been vital to Texas small busi-
nesses and I dare say to the Nation’s 
small businesses. I am glad Congress, 
working together as we should during a 
time of national emergency, was able 
to provide this lifeline and replenish 
these funds when they ran dry. 
That is not to say, though, that this 
program has been implemented with-
out a hitch. When you do something 
this big and this fast, there are bound 
to be some hiccups. We expected there 
would be these small holes and gaps in 
what was needed, and over the last few 
weeks, those have become pretty clear. 
One of those issues is the tax deduct-
ible expenses for the businesses that 
take advantage of these loans. Busi-
nesses are normally able to deduct 
wages and other business expenses 
from their taxable income, but the no-
tice issued by the IRS said small busi-
nesses cannot deduct these expenses, 
which is exactly the opposite of what 
we intended to do. Just to give an idea 
of how harmful this could be, if a small 
business’s payroll during the 8-week 
period covered by a loan were $100,000, 
that amount could not be deducted as a 
business expense when they file their 
taxes. 
Our goal with this legislation was to 
help—not hurt—to help small busi-
nesses remain solvent and keep their 
employees on the payroll so they can 
recover from this pandemic as soon as 
possible and be ready for what I hope is 
a v-shaped bounceback in our economy 
once we defeat this virus. We certainly 
didn’t intend to make next year’s tax 
season a nightmare or to add to the 
burdens of these small businesses. Yet, 
based on the IRS’s guidance, that is 
the path we are headed down. 
We have to right this wrong. Yester-
day, I introduced the bipartisan Small 
Business Expense Protection Act with 
the chairman and ranking member of 
the 
Finance 
Committee, 
Senator 
GRASSLEY and Senator WYDEN, along 
with Senator RUBIO, who chairs the 
Small Business Committee, and Sen-
ator CARPER, who serves, as I do, on 
the Finance Committee. This legisla-
tion will clarify that small businesses 
can still deduct expenses that were 
paid for with a forgiven paycheck pro-
tection loan from their taxes. Without 
this clarification, small businesses will 
be up the creek without a paddle when 
they file their taxes next year. 
This program was created to reduce 
the financial barriers our small busi-
nesses are trying to overcome, not to 
add more. This bipartisan bill has al-
ready received support of the American 
Institute of CPAs—certified public ac-
countants—and is critical to ensuring 
America’s small businesses receive the 
full benefits intended by Congress in 
the Paycheck Protection Program. 
As we continue to provide relief for 
America’s workers and small busi-
nesses, it is critical that this fix be in-
cluded. Texas small businesses saw the 
Paycheck Protection Program as a 
lifeline during this incredibly chal-
lenging time. Let’s not make them re-
gret grabbing ahold of it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask 
permission to speak for up to the full 
10 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. KAINE. I rise to discuss the next 
steps the Senate should take in dealing 
with the COVID–19 global pandemic. 
I applaud the bipartisan result Con-
gress has shown in passing four impor-
tant pieces of legislation to provide 
trillions of dollars of aid to Americans 
in the midst of this catastrophe. 
My heart goes out to people who are 
suffering. When we were last here vot-
ing sort of near midnight on March 25 
or early in the morning on March 26, 
675 
Americans 
had 
then 
died 
of 
coronavirus. Now, more than 72,000 
have. In the few weeks we have been 
away, the number of deaths has in-
creased by more than 70,000. Millions 
have been diagnosed. Those numbers 
are rising every day. 
The crisis has been the most severe 
economic shock our Nation has experi-
enced in decades, even more severe 
than the economic collapse of 2008–2009. 
Madam President, just a personal 
privilege. I know four people who have 
died of coronavirus. 
Jeanette 
Galliano, 
my 
brother 
Steve’s mother-in-law, died in a senior 
facility in New Orleans in the last few 
weeks. 
Lois Shaver. Lois is the mother of 
one of our closest friends, the god-
mother of our middle son. Lois died in 
a nursing home in Fairfax County in 
Northern Virginia in the last few 
weeks. 
Gerald Glenn was a minister, a 
bishop, and pillar of the Richmond 
faith community. He was somebody I 
appointed to boards when I was Gov-
ernor. Senator WARNER did the same. 
Bishop 
Glenn 
passed 
away 
of 
coronavirus right after Easter. 
Dolson Anderson was a longtime 
friend. His wife Linda was one of my

agency heads when I was Governor. As 
Dolson was providing care for Linda 
after 
knee 
surgery, 
he 
contracted 
coronavirus, and after 16 days on a ven-
tilator, he died. 
There are two other names. My next 
door neighbor, Dean DeForest. My wife 
Anne and I have lived next to Dean and 
Mary Ruth for 28 years. Dean died after 
2 weeks, after a long battle with lung 
cancer, not coronavirus. But what 
coronavirus meant for Dean and so 
many like him was he couldn’t have 
family with him in the normal way. He 
couldn’t have a funeral or a memorial 
service or family gathered to grieve in 
the normal way because of people’s 
worry about infection. 
Then there is Lorna Breen. Lorna 
was a Charlottesville native who was 
working as an emergency room physi-
cian in New York Presbyterian and was 
so stressed out by what she saw. She 
developed coronavirus. She went back 
to the hospital to work as soon as she 
could, and it was too much for her. She 
went home to be with her family in 
Charlottesville, and about 10 days ago, 
she died by suicide after facing the tre-
mendous burden of being a first re-
sponder. 
I want to mention all of them. All of 
us—everyone in this Chamber, every-
one who works here—have direct per-
sonal connections. The suffering is 
massive, and it is likely to continue. 
Because it is, Congress should do more. 
The American public expects us to, and 
we shouldn’t let them down. 
What should be our next priorities? 
One way to look at the legislation we 
already passed is that Congress has 
provided aid to five basic pillars: aid to 
individuals and families; grants to 
small businesses and nonprofit organi-
zations; loans to medium and large size 
businesses; aid to local and State gov-
ernments; 
and 
aid 
to 
hospitals, 
healthcare 
providers, 
and 
the 
healthcare system. 
The three bills we passed in March 
made major investments in each of 
these five pillars. By April, we realized 
that the depth of the crisis was so 
great, we needed to do more. While we 
realized that our action was going to 
be partial rather than comprehensive, 
we did step up to do more to provide 
support for two of those five pillars— 
small 
businesses, 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare providers. 
After providing $350 billion in forgiv-
able loans for small businesses under 
the CARES Act, we added another $370 
billion in April for small businesses 
through additional loans, through the 
PPP program, SBA’s EIDL grant-loan 
program, and a new set-aside directing 
resources to small businesses through 
smaller financial institutions. 
And, recognizing that this is fun-
damentally a public health emergency, 
we also added $100 billion in new health 
funds—$75 billion for healthcare pro-
viders and $25 billion to enable the 
United States to finally support devel-
opment of a competent and comprehen-
sive testing program. 
We did not hesitate to act in pro-
viding more resources to two key pil-
lars—small businesses and our health 
system—and that tells me what our 
next step should be. We should show 
the same willingness to direct more re-
sources to individuals and families, as 
well as State and local governments. 
Individuals and families are hurting. 
Thirty million Americans have filed 
for unemployment. People have lost 
jobs. Some have businesses that may 
never reopen, and they have seen other 
unplanned expenses for healthcare or 
childcare, as local schools have closed. 
Rent and mortgage payments, car pay-
ments, utility bills, food and medi-
cine—these expenses continue, and the 
pressure on working Americans is in-
tense. 
When we passed the CARES Act in 
March, I was struck by the fact that 
the PPP program for small businesses 
was $350 billion, but the total direct 
payments for families was only $295 bil-
lion—about 85 percent of the business 
grant program. 
Given that we just added another $370 
billion in aid for small businesses, I 
think we should add an equal amount 
for individuals and families. Whether 
this is a second round of direct pay-
ments or a combination of direct pay-
ments and other supports—childcare, 
rent 
and 
mortgage 
assistance—we 
should show the public that we value 
the needs of families and individuals as 
much as we value small businesses. 
And the second thing we should do is 
to provide more assistance and flexi-
bility to State and local governments. 
The CARES Act provided $150 billion in 
block grant funding to States and lo-
calities, but this $150 billion was lim-
ited for use to only deal with unantici-
pated costs connected with COVID–19. 
Here is an odd thing. The funds for 
businesses were specifically designed to 
help them deal with revenue losses so 
that they could remain in operation 
and avoid layoffs. The hospital and 
healthcare provider funding was de-
signed to help deal with revenue losses 
experienced as we postponed elective 
surgeries and clinical visits. The funds 
were designed to avoid layoffs. The aid 
to individuals was designed to help 
families cope with lost wages and lost 
salary. 
But the CARES bill would not allow 
State or local governments to use 
funds to backstop lost revenue, and 
that is having serious consequences. 
I was a mayor and a Governor. I 
know that 46 States have a fiscal year 
that starts on July 1, and that means 
that most States and local govern-
ments are working on their budgets 
right now. They have to project income 
and expenses for the next year and 
write their budgets accordingly. 
So what are State and local govern-
ments seeing? Massive declines in tax 
revenue. Sales taxes are declining. 
Meals taxes, lodging taxes, income 
taxes—all are declining. Jurisdictions 
are trying to figure out the extent of 
the likely decline, and though it is 
hard to know with certainty, the rev-
enue drops are sizeable. 
In Virginia, the town of Abingdon is 
predicting a revenue loss of about 15 
percent; Fredericksburg, more than 10 
percent; Blacksburg, nearly 18 percent. 
The list goes on and on. The Common-
wealth of Virginia is predicting rev-
enue losses of $2 to $3 billion over the 
next 2 fiscal years. 
If cities, towns, counties, and States 
lose revenue, what are their options? 
Since most government costs are per-
sonnel, here is what they will be forced 
to cut—teachers, police officers, fire-
fighters, EMTs. That is already hap-
pening in Virginia and all over the 
country. 
Staunton is proposing furlough days 
for all city employees, including first 
responders. Prince William County has 
removed 31 police, fire, and sheriff posi-
tions from their budget. Abingdon is 
laying off 13 full-time and 64 part-time 
employees. 
Every State, city, county, and town 
in this country is making the same de-
cisions right now, and it shouldn’t be 
this way. We provided funds to busi-
nesses to backstop revenue losses so 
they could avoid layoffs. We provided 
funds to hospitals to backstop revenue 
losses so they could avoid layoffs. We 
need to allow our State and local gov-
ernments to backstop revenue losses so 
they can avoid layoffs. 
It is never a good time to lay off 
teachers, firefighters, police, sheriffs, 
EMTs—never. But I can tell you that 
the worst time to do it is a national 
health emergency. The overwhelming 
majority of our first responders work 
for State and local governments. Why 
would we want to lay them off? 
President Trump has said he doesn’t 
want to bail out States and local gov-
ernments, and he has criticized them. 
He didn’t name-call businesses that 
wanted help. He didn’t say: We will not 
bail you out. Instead, he wanted to ex-
tend the helping hand. His attacks on 
State and local governments are par-
ticularly insulting since the American 
public is much more satisfied with how 
their State and local leaders are han-
dling this crisis than how the adminis-
tration is. 
Senator MCCONNELL
advanced the 
idea that States and local governments 
should consider bankruptcy. He didn’t 
say that about businesses that wanted 
aid. 
Promoting 
bankruptcy, 
which 
would mean layoffs and broken prom-
ises to pensioners, is heartless. 
America needs its teachers and its 
first responders. This isn’t a Democrat 
or Republican thing. There are as 
many Republican Governors as there 
are Democrats. There are as many cit-
ies and counties managed with Repub-
lican leadership as there are Demo-
crats. 
The CARES Act had $150 billion for 
general State and local government re-
lief, but we have now done over $1.2 
trillion in relief for businesses. I am 
glad we are helping our businesses get 
through this, but don’t the commu-
nities where we live and work, send our

Does anyone really believe that we will

teachers,

The Senator from Illinois. 
DACA 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I spent 5 
weeks in my home in Springfield, IL, 
following orders—good ones—to sug-
gest that I had to get out of circulation 
and so should everyone else. It was an 
interesting moment. My wife and I 
think it may have been the longest 
stretch we had ever spent under the 
same roof together. We got along, 
which is good, and I got to field the 
neighborhood a little more than I usu-
ally do as I travel back and forth al-
most every week. 
I got to know the people a little 
more, waving from a distance. I looked 
around and noticed that almost every 
lawn had a sign on it saying: ‘‘We love 
healthcare workers.’’ Many people had 
signs in their windows to back that up 
too, and we should. These doctors, 
these nurses, and these people who 
work in nursing homes caring for the 
elderly and making certain they are in 
a good, safe environment are impor-
tant, and they are risking their lives 
for the people whom we love. We thank 
them over and over. But there is one 
part of that group that I would like to 
highlight for just a few moments on 
the floor of the Senate. I want to spend 
a few minutes talking about one spe-
cial group of healthcare workers—im-
migrants. 
One in six healthcare and social serv-
ice workers—3.1 million out of 18.7 mil-
lion—are immigrants. When they come 
on television and give us a breakdown 
of what is going on in emergency 
rooms and the likelihood of our success 
in communities in dealing with this 
coronavirus, you must notice so many 
times and think that they may be new-
comers to the United States. Many of 
them are. 
These immigrants are playing a crit-
ical role in the battle against this pan-
demic. Yet the President of the United 
States and many around him continue 
to disparage immigrants, falsely claim-
ing that they are just a drain on soci-
ety, that all they are doing is taking 
our jobs away and we really wouldn’t 
miss them if they were gone. So I came 
to the floor today to tell a story about 
one of them, an immigrant health hero. 
I will be joined by some of my col-
leagues who have similar stories to 
tell. 
We are inviting people to share their 
own stories on social media using the 
hashtag ‘‘immigranthealthheroes.’’ I 
will put up the hashtag here so that if 
anyone wants to check in, they can do 
so. 
Many of these healthcare workers are 
young immigrants who came to the 
United States as children. They are 
known as Dreamers. They are Amer-
ican in every way except for their legal 
immigration status. They were brought 
here at an early age by parents who 
didn’t give them a vote on the decision, 
grew up in the United States, went to 
our schools, sometimes all the way 
through 
college 
and 
professional 
school, want to make a life in this 
country, have no criminal record, and 
are just looking for a chance. 
It was 9 years ago when I joined Re-
publican Senator Dick Lugar on a bi-
partisan basis asking President Obama 
to use his executive authority to pro-
tect these Dreamers from deportation. 
He responded and created the Deferred 
Action 
for 
Childhood 
Arrivals, 
or 
DACA. 
DACA provides temporary protection 
from deportation for Dreamers if they 
register with the government, pay a 
substantial fee, and go through a 
criminal background check. More than 
800,000 Dreamers came forward and re-
ceived President Obama’s DACA pro-
tection. 
DACA unleashed the full potential 
for these Dreamers that they never 
dreamed they would have, and they 
started contributing to America as sol-
diers and teachers and small business 
owners. 
More than 200,000 DACA recipients 
are now categorized as ‘‘essential crit-
ical infrastructure workers’’—‘‘essen-
tial critical infrastructure workers.’’ 
Who came up with that name? It is the 
definition of President Trump’s own 
Department of Homeland Security. One 
out of four of these DACA protectees 
are essential critical infrastructure 
workers, and among these essential 
workers are 41,700 DACA recipients in 
the healthcare industry. They include 
doctors, intensive care nurses, para-
medics, and respiratory therapists. 
But on September 5, 2017, President 
Trump repealed DACA. Because of that 
action by the President, hundreds of 
thousands of Dreamers face losing 
their jobs, but, more importantly, they 
face being deported, many to countries 
they barely remember, if they remem-
ber at all. 
The courts stepped in and blocked 
the 
President 
from 
enforcing 
this 
DACA decision, but he took on the ap-
peal of that decision, and now it is in 
the Supreme Court, just across the 
street. 
I was proud to lead 172 current and 
former Members of Congress on a bi-
partisan brief asking the Supreme 
Court 
to 
rule 
against 
President 
Trump’s repeal of DACA. These young 
DACA recipients are being protected 
while the case is being considered by 
the Supreme Court, but a decision 
could come down any day—could come 
down any day—that basically makes 
these young people subject to deporta-
tion and takes away any legal right

May 6, 2020 
they have to work. If the Court rules in 
favor of President Trump on DACA, 
200,000 essential American workers will 
be sidelined and deported, even as we 
fight this pandemic. 
Last month, I sent a letter to the 
President—37 of my colleagues joined 
me—urging him to extend the work au-
thorization for DACA recipients, not to 
make their future depend on what hap-
pens in the Court. The President has 
the authority to say that, at least until 
the end of the calendar year—or be-
yond, I hope—we are not going to de-
port these young people, and we are 
not going to take their jobs away, par-
ticularly those in the healthcare indus-
try. 
But 
if 
you 
consider 
President 
Trump’s attitude toward immigrants, 
you know he is likely to forge ahead 
with his decision to deport the Dream-
ers. That means we have to do our part. 
I worked with Republican Senator 
LINDSEY GRAHAM, chairman of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, to include a 
provision 
to 
automatically 
extend 
work authorizations for DACA recipi-
ents in the CARES Act that Congress 
just passed a few weeks ago. We pre-
sented it to the leaders on a bipartisan 
basis. We had the approval of Senate 
Democratic leader CHUCK SCHUMER and 
Speaker of the House NANCY PELOSI, 
but not the Republican leader in the 
Senate. He stopped us from extending 
this protection. I don’t know what his 
situation is in Kentucky, but I can tell 
you that in Illinois, we need every one 
of these healthcare workers we have 
today. We can’t afford to lose them. To 
think that 41,000 DACA recipients and 
another 11,000 TPS critical healthcare 
workers would be deported would mean 
that many Americans who count on 
these great professionals are going to 
get less care and perhaps terrible re-
sults. 
As Congress debates the next legisla-
tion to address the COVID–19 pan-
demic, I will continue pushing for this 
provision. It is not too much to ask 
that if these people simply want to be 
working in ERs and hospitals, risking 
their lives for all of us, that they at 
least have the peace of mind to know 
that they can stay until the end of the 
calendar year. That is all I am asking 
for. Is it too much to ask? Some of 
them are suffering, and their families 
are suffering too. All they want is the 
authority to stay here. 
Last year, the House of Representa-
tives passed the Dream and Promise 
Act, based on the Dream Act, with a 
strong vote. Senator MCCONNELL has 
refused to call it in the Senate. It could 
help us. I wish he would consider it. 
I have come to the floor over 100 
times and told the stories of Dreamers. 
I don’t think there is any better way to 
make 
the 
case—meet 
them, 
know 
them, realize what they brought to 
America and what they bring each day. 
Today, I want to tell you the story of 
this man. His name is Manuel Bernal. 
He works in the emergency department 
at the Advocate Christ Medical Center. 
Manuel was brought to the United 
States when he was 2 years old. He 
grew up in Memphis, TN. He always 
wanted to become a doctor. He wrote 
me a letter, and he said: 
Early on, I developed an appreciation for 
the medical profession when I witnessed the 
compassionate care received by a loved one 
at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. 
Manuel graduated in the top 10 per-
cent of his hospital class. He was a 
leader of several high school honor so-
cieties. In his spare time, he was a 
swimmer, a football player, and volun-
teered at the St. Jude Club and the Key 
Club. 
He continued his education at the 
University 
of 
Tennessee 
at 
Chat-
tanooga. He graduated summa cum 
laude in biology with a minor in chem-
istry. In college, he worked as a med-
ical scribe for doctors in the emer-
gency room at a small community hos-
pital in Chattanooga. After this experi-
ence, he decided he wanted to go all the 
way. He wanted to become an emer-
gency room physician. He continued 
his education at Loyola University 
Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. 
Allow me a few seconds to praise this 
wonderful school. He was one of dozens 
of DACA recipients at Stritch, which 
was the first medical school to admit 
DACA students. They do not receive 
any special treatment in the selection 
process, and they are not eligible for a 
penny in Federal financial assistance. 
Many of them borrowed money from 
the State of Illinois to complete their 
medical education in the hopes that 
once they are licensed, they can come 
back and practice in our State, which 
they promise to do. 
Here is what Manuel says DACA 
means to him: 
DACA has undoubtedly opened up many 
doors for me. It meant allowing me to obtain 
my dream of serving others through emer-
gency medicine. If DACA ended, I would be 
forced to stop doing not only what I love 
doing but what I trained so hard to do. 
Today, Dr. Manuel Bernal is an emer-
gency 
room 
resident 
at 
Advocate 
Christ Medical Center in Chicago, one 
of the busiest trauma hospitals in our 
city. His supervisor told him he did not 
have to treat COVID–19 patients be-
cause he is only a resident, but he 
stepped forward and volunteered to do 
it anyway. 
Manuel’s DACA is set to expire in Oc-
tober, 5 months from now. Will Amer-
ica be stronger if this doctor leaves? 
Will they be better at Advocate Christ 
Medical Center, the trauma hospital, if 
Manuel was forced to leave this coun-
try? I can’t imagine anyone would an-
swer yes. 
Manuel and hundreds of thousands of 
other Dreamers are counting on the 
Supreme Court to reject President 
Trump’s abolition of DACA and count-
ing on us who serve in the Senate to 
solve this crisis President Trump alone 
created. As long as I am a U.S. Sen-
ator, I will continue to come to the 
floor of the Senate to advocate for 
Manuel and for thousands of others 
who simply want a chance to prove 
themselves to earn their way into 
America’s future. It would be an Amer-
ican tragedy at this moment when we 
face this national emergency to lose 
these brave and talented young people. 
They are saving lives every day, and 
they are risking their own to do it. Can 
we ask anything more of anyone else in 
this country? We must ensure that 
Manuel and hundreds of thousands of 
others in our essential workforce are 
not forced to stop working when their 
services are needed now more than 
ever. 
Ultimately, we need to pass legisla-
tion that is just common sense, that 
says these young people who came here 
as kids and have worked doubly hard 
under the greatest of pressures and 
have made a success of their lives, like 
this young man, can stay in America 
and be part of our future. He is truly a 
healthcare hero, and he is an immi-
grant. He is an immigrant healthcare 
hero, and there are thousands just like 
him across America. We need them now 
more than ever. 
I see that Senator CORTEZ MASTO is 
here. I know she wants to speak on this 
subject. 
I yield the floor to her. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Nevada.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-

period of morning business, with Sen-

to 10 minutes each.

DACA 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise, along with my good friend and 
colleague, the senior Senator from Illi-
nois, to stress the importance of what 
is happening in this country right now 
and who is on the frontline during this 
healthcare crisis and why we need to 
support them. There is no doubt. 
I just came from Nevada. There are 
so many essential workers who are 
risking their lives, as well as their 
loved ones, to provide essential care 
and help for individuals, not just in Ne-
vada but across the country. We are 
talking about healthcare workers. We 
are talking about transit drivers, sani-
tation workers, first responders. We 
are talking about those who are work-
ing with the grocery stores, showing up 
every day to make sure that individ-
uals in need can have the groceries 
they so require during this healthcare 
crisis. 
So much is at stake right now. I do 
not want to forget all of those State 
and local government workers. Right 
now in my State, there are so many

State workers who are showing up to 
ensure that individuals get the essen-
tial paycheck or the expanded unem-
ployment insurance that we fought to 
make sure they can receive, and they 
are showing up, as well. 
I, too, stand with my colleague be-
cause I think it is important that we 
recognize not only our healthcare 
workers but some of those who need 
extra help from this legislature. We 
have spent, unfortunately, the last 3 
years of this administration attacking 
them. These are our immigrants in Ne-
vada and across this country who are 
actually going out every day and risk-
ing their lives to help others in need, 
and 
they 
are 
working 
in 
our 
healthcare. 
One of them I rise to talk about 
today is Anna Ledesma. She is a DACA 
recipient in Nevada, and she works in a 
pediatric ICU in Nevada as a nurse, in 
Las Vegas. Anna has been in the United 
States since she was 7 years old. She 
got interested in medicine because an 
aunt who was a nurse thought it would 
be the perfect career for her. Her aunt 
was right. Anna loves biology and she 
loves learning how disease process 
works. But, most of all, Anna loves her 
patients. She said: ‘‘I love connecting 
with them over Disney stuff.’’ Anna 
will tell you: ‘‘I think I’m a good pedi-
atric nurse because at heart, I’m still a 
kid too.’’ 
All across Nevada, immigrants like 
Anna are working on the frontlines to 
help 
others 
in 
need 
during 
this 
healthcare crisis. They are working as 
teachers for children learning from 
home. They are staffing retirement 
homes, taking care of at-risk seniors in 
the middle of a pandemic that targets 
our elders. They are harvesting, they 
are shelving, and they are cooking food 
for all of us. 
More than 200,000 DACA recipients in 
the United States are on the frontlines 
of healthcare, education, agriculture, 
and other essential jobs. There are al-
most 5,000 of them in Nevada alone 
among the 12,000 Nevada DACA recipi-
ents. These are our friends, and they 
are our neighbors. 
Yet this administration continues to 
demonize them with anti-immigrant 
rhetoric and has turned their lives up-
side down by trying to end DACA. 
These are the young professionals at 
risk if the Supreme Court upholds 
President Trump’s decision to termi-
nate DACA. 
These young men and women have 
grown up in our communities, and they 
are giving back. Even in the face of 
their uncertain futures, they are still 
showing up to work each shift and still 
demonstrating by their everyday her-
oism that they belong here. 
Now, more than ever, we need to un-
derstand that those who come to Amer-
ica in search of a better life don’t di-
minish us. They enrich us. You can see 
how cruel and twisted the immigration 
debate in this country has become if 
you just think about this: In the mid-
dle of a worldwide health crisis, when 
they should be focused on keeping their 
patients alive and limiting their own 
exposure, the 27,000 DACA recipients in 
healthcare have to worry about their 
own legal status. 
Anna says that the health crisis her 
hospital is facing has almost managed 
to push out the fear that is always in 
the back of her mind about attacks on 
DACA and attacks on her future—al-
most, because it never really goes 
away. A few weeks ago, Anna was 
transferred to other parts of the hos-
pital to help adult patients with 
COVID–19. She told me about the utter 
isolation of these patients who are 
fighting for their lives far from their 
loved ones. She told me about former 
University Medical Center friends and 
colleagues, now in New York and in Se-
attle, who are witnessing the same 
scenes. 
Lately, the number of children suf-
fering from COVID–19 has increased in 
Nevada. Anna is back in the pediatric 
ICU, where patients are mostly asymp-
tomatic. With these healthier patients, 
it is easier to do what she does best, 
which is to teach kids the things they 
need to know about a procedure or an 
operation they are facing, distracting 
them and making them laugh. 
We need to let Anna do her job. We 
need to let the thousands of immi-
grants who are on the frontline right 
now continue to do their jobs. We must 
allow her to keep serving the only com-
munity she has ever known. We need to 
create a pathway for citizenship for so 
many like Anna. We need to give them 
all the tools they need to keep them-
selves and the rest of us healthy. 
Anna’s story is an American story— 
one of struggle, courage, and sacrifice 
for your community in order to build a 
brighter future for those who come 
after. 
I am going to continue to fight for 
DACA recipients and immigrants like 
Anna and everyone else who has con-
tributed, not just in my State but in 
this country, to not only enrich all of 
our lives but to continue to contribute 
to our economy and to make our lives 
better. The least we can do is to give 
them peace of mind and let them know 
that the only country they have ever 
known is one they can stay in forever. 
That is my fight. I hope that is the 
Presiding Officer’s fight and of many of 
my colleagues. This is something that 
must be done. We have to pass legisla-
tion to make sure Dreamers in this 
country and their parents have every 
opportunity to stay and find that path-
way to citizenship. They are already 
contributing. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleague from Nevada. 
Anna’s story is so touching. This young 
girl, concerned about her own future, 
worried about deportation, gets into a 
giving, caring profession and risks her 
life in caring for those who may be suf-
fering from COVID–19. To think some-
one would question whether we want 
that kind of person in America’s future 
is beyond me. 
Thank you for telling that story. It is 
an important part of the RECORD.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. This week, amid the 
devastating coronavirus pandemic, we 
saw what world powers are supposed to 
do—join forces to raise funds to re-
search, manufacture, and distribute a 
vaccine and treatments. This makes 
obvious strategic and lifesaving sense, 
being both the moral and strategic 
thing to do. All of us joining forces and 
working together will help speed up ef-
forts and the eventual discovery and 
distribution of a coronavirus vaccine 
that we all desperately seek. Many of 
us believe that until that day comes 
when that vaccine proves to be effec-
tive and safe and is widely distributed, 
we are going to still see what we call 
our normal lives compromised. So 
there is no greater priority. This effort 
will save lives around America and 
around the world. 
Who knows where that vaccine is 
going to be discovered, produced, or 
distributed? I want America in on this 
conversation from the start and end on 
the collective efforts. Clearly, other 
world leaders understand this. So when 
there was an effort to raise $8 billion 
for the discovery of this new vaccine, 
they had a virtual global telephone 
conference. Our allies in the European 
Union and Norway offered to give $1 
billion each toward this goal. Who was 
absent from this critical effort to save 
lives around the world, to discover this 
vaccine, including the distribution of it 
to those who need it in every corner of 
the world? Which country did not par-
ticipate in this global virtual tele-
phone conference? The United States of 
America. 
In yet another shortsighted, missed 
opportunity 
to 
address 
the 
coronavirus, this administration re-
fused to participate. America was miss-
ing in action when leaders around the 
world came together with the deter-
mination to find and distribute a vac-
cine against coronavirus. The Presi-
dent’s supporters in Congress said 
nothing, focusing instead on judicial 
appointments and other things on their 
mind. 
Given this President’s penchant for 
blaming others but not himself for any 
mishandling of this viral contagion, 
maybe his dereliction of duty in this 
global conference should come as no 
surprise, but it does because of the dev-
astating consequences that could re-
sult. What does this mean for America 
if the United States sits on the side-
lines while other countries set out to 
discover this lifesaving vaccine? 
Well, we still continue to have some 
of the best researchers in the world at 
the National Institutes of Health, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, and the many university and 
private researchers around this coun-
try. Many NIH-funded researchers have

spent years studying coronaviruses. 
Perhaps their knowledge could be help-
ful with these other countries in quick-
ly developing an effective vaccine. In 
fact, some clinical trials are already 
now under way by the National Insti-
tutes of Health. I want to commend Dr. 
Francis Collins, who heads up NIH, 
and, of course, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a 
friend of many years, for their amazing 
work. But it is quite plausible—it is 
even possible—that the best vaccine 
may turn up in another country. 
There are efforts under way in Eng-
land and Germany and in many other 
countries to find this vaccine, as well. 
In a rush to research and validate a 
vaccine, ramp up production, address 
global allocation and supply needs and 
ensure affordability and access world-
wide, will the United States be stand-
ing on the sidelines again? When the 
United States pursues a go-it-alone— 
not just ‘‘America first’’ but ‘‘America 
only’’—approach, while the rest of the 
world is working together, where does 
that leave us? 
Remember, it hasn’t been that long 
ago when the United States first opted 
to develop and distribute its own 
American coronavirus test kits that 
turned out to be faulty, instead of 
choosing the World Health Organiza-
tion’s test kit, which was available at 
the time. That set our Nation back at 
least a month, up to 6 weeks. In fact, 
many believe we still haven’t recovered 
from that critical first misstep by this 
administration. 
Even when his own incompetent re-
sponse was increasingly obvious, Presi-
dent Trump turned and tried to place 
all the blame on the World Health Or-
ganization, even cutting off all U.S. 
funding to this critical international 
body with decades of experience in 
dealing with pandemics. 
The New York Times columnist Nick 
Kristof 
starkly 
wrote 
last 
month: 
‘‘Thousands of Americans would be 
alive today if President Trump had 
spent more time listening to the World 
Health Organization instead of trying 
to destroy it.’’ 
Don’t get me wrong, WHO and many 
international bodies are imperfect and 
make mistakes, and they are often 
only as strong as their member states 
are willing to help make them or help 
fund them. 
The World Health Organization first 
warned of the coronavirus on January 
4, issuing increasingly urgent warnings 
in February, while the President was 
saying publicly that the issue ‘‘was to-
tally under control.’’ American per-
sonnel at the World Health Organiza-
tion were also sending warnings back 
to Washington about the threat. What 
was the President’s response? On Feb-
ruary 10, he said of the coronavirus: 
‘‘When it gets a little warmer, it mi-
raculously goes away.’’ 
On February 27, the President said: 
‘‘It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s 
like a miracle, it will disappear.’’ 
Well, more than 2 months later, we 
are still waiting for that and praying 
for that, and 70,000 Americans have 
died. The WHO is a critical lifesaving 
body that helps eradicate polio, reduce 
the number of women and children who 
die in childbirth, and stem malnutri-
tion. The WHO has led the historic 
global vaccination campaign to eradi-
cate small pox. 
When it was issuing coronavirus 
warnings, the President and all of us 
should have been listening. Instead, the 
President ignored them and chose to 
walk away from the World Health Or-
ganization, 
undermining 
its 
inter-
national efforts and, ultimately, giving 
more global leadership to, of all na-
tions, China, which is only more than 
happy to step in when the United 
States steps away. 
We should be increasing our invest-
ment and leadership at the World 
Health Organization as one of the 
many efforts to stem this virus and not 
cover our ears and walking away from 
it. 
The World Health Organization’s ef-
forts to halt Ebola are an example of 
what its work can do to save lives at 
the outbreak of a pandemic and stop 
one from reaching the United States. 
Presidents Obama and George W. 
Bush understood this need for global 
health engagement. I was proud to 
rally to President Bush’s call to stem 
the scourge of AIDS around the world 
through the historic PEPFAR pro-
gram. It was a bipartisan, inter-
national, global effort—the world first, 
not just America first. Many of my Re-
publican friends in the Senate sup-
ported these efforts, and we need them 
now with this coronavirus outbreak. 
I was equally proud of President 
Obama’s efforts to set up infectious 
disease prevention systems and his 
leadership on the Ebola crisis. 
Presidents Bush and Obama under-
stood the traditional leadership role of 
the United States in such matters and 
how important it was for the world to 
know that we were engaged and in-
volved. 
Sadly, so much of the world looks at 
us in dismay today as President Trump 
undermines American Governors who 
are doing their best to try and save 
lives, and refuses to take any responsi-
bility, snubs our allies, and withdraws 
from global efforts. 
That is why I plan to introduce a res-
olution here in the Senate calling on 
the United States to join this impor-
tant global vaccine and treatment ef-
fort—something I hope my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle will support. 
Can we put aside our political dif-
ferences for a moment and agree on one 
basic thing? Wherever this vaccine is 
to be discovered, we pray that it will be 
done quickly, effectively, and safely. 
We want the United States in on the ef-
fort, whether it is discovered here in 
our country or in another country. We 
want to be at the table to help support 
the research and development efforts. 
We want to be at the table when the 
good news of the discovery of this vac-
cine is delivered. We certainly want to 
be at the table when it comes to ques-
tions of manufacturing and distrib-
uting this vaccine around the world, 
and especially here in the United 
States. 
Standing by on the sidelines with our 
arms folded, chins jutted out, and say-
ing it is America first or else—this is 
the wrong moment for it. This is a 
global challenge. It is a global solu-
tion. We don’t know which country God 
will bless with the ability to come up 
with this vaccine. Whatever it is, we 
want to be at that table with them in 
its development and distribution. 
Let’s remember that this global pan-
demic and any real solution involves 
more than just our great country. We 
cannot isolate ourselves from this 
international race to find treatments 
and develop a vaccine. Doing anything 
else will only waste more time and cost 
lives. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD a 
Washington Post article of May 5, 2020, 
on the subject. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

VIRTUAL
VACCINE
SUMMIT
AS 
WORLD LEADERS PLEDGE BILLIONS TO EF-
FORTS 
(By William Booth, Carolyn Y. Johnson and 
Carol Morello) 
LONDON—World leaders came together in a 
virtual summit Monday to pledge billions of 
dollars to quickly develop vaccines and drugs 
to fight the coronavirus. 
Missing from the roster was the Trump ad-
ministration, which declined to participate 
but highlighted from Washington what one 
official called its ‘‘whole-of-america’’ efforts 
in the United States and its generosity to 
global health efforts. 
The online conference, led by European 
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen 
and a halfdozen countries, was set to raise 
$8.2 
billion 
from 
governments, 
philan-
thropies and the private sector to fund re-
search and mass-produce drugs, vaccines and 
testing kits to combat the virus, which has 
killed more than 250,000 people worldwide. 
With the money came soaring rhetoric 
about international solidarity and a good bit 
of boasting about each country’s efforts and 
achievements, live and prerecorded, by Ger-
many’s Angela Merkel, France’s Emmanuel 
Macron, Britain’s Boris Johnson, Japan’s 
Shinzo 
Abe—alongside 
Israel’s 
Benjamin 
Netanyahu 
and 
Turkey’s 
Recep 
Tayyip 
Erdogan. 
‘‘The more we pull together and share our 
expertise, the faster our scientists will suc-
ceed,’’ said Johnson, who was so stricken by 
the virus that he thought he might never 
leave the intensive care unit alive last 
month. ‘‘The race to discover the vaccine to 
defeat this virus is not a competition be-
tween countries but the most urgent shared 
endeavor of our lifetimes.’’ 
A senior Trump administration official 
said Monday the United States ‘‘welcomes’’ 
the efforts of the conference participants. He 
did not explain why the United States did 
not join them. 
‘‘Many of the organizations and programs 
this pledging conference seeks to support al-
ready receive very significant funding and 
support from the U.S. government and pri-
vate sector,’’ said the official, who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity under White 
House rules for briefing reporters.

Public health officials and researchers ex-
pressed surprise. 
‘‘It’s the first time that I can think of 
where you have had a major international 
pledging conference for a global crisis of this 
kind of importance, and the U.S. is just ab-
sent,’’ said Jeremy Konyndyk, who worked 
on the Ebola response in the Obama adminis-
tration. 
Given that no one knows which vaccines 
will succeed, he said, it’s crucial to back 
multiple efforts working in parallel. 
‘‘Against that kind of uncertainty we 
should be trying to position ourselves to be 
supporting—and 
potentially 
benefiting 
from—all of them,’’ said Konyndyk, a senior 
policy fellow at the Center for Global Devel-
opment. ‘‘And instead we seem to be just fo-
cused on trying to win the race, in the hopes 
we happen to get one of the successful ones.’’ 
Conference participants expressed a need 
for unity. 
‘‘We can’t just have the wealthiest coun-
tries have a vaccine and not share it with 
the world,’’ Canadian Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau said. 
‘‘Let us in the international community 
unite to overcome this crisis,’’ Abe said. 
Russia and India also did not participate. 
Chinese premier Li Keqiang was replaced at 
the last minute by Zhang Ming, Beijing’s 
ambassador to the European Union. 
The U.S. official said the United States ‘‘is 
the single largest health and humanitarian 
donor in world. And the American people 
have continued that legacy of generosity in 
the global fight against covid19.’’ 
‘‘And we would welcome additional high- 
quality, transparent contributions from oth-
ers,’’ he said. 
Asked three more times to explain why the 
United States did not attend, the official 
said he already had given an answer. 
The U.S. government has provided $775 
million in emergency health, humanitarian, 
economic and development aid for govern-
ments, international organizations and char-
ities fighting the pandemic. The official said 
the United States is in the process of giving 
about twice that amount in additional fund-
ing. 
There was one major American player at 
the virtual summit: the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation, which promised to spend 
$125 million in the fight. 
‘‘This virus doesn’t care what nationality 
you are,’’ Melinda Gates told the gathering. 
As long as the virus is somewhere, she said, 
it’s everywhere. 
Scientists are working around-the-clock to 
find a cure or treatment for the coronavirus. 
The World Health Organization says eight 
vaccines have entered human trials and an-
other 94 are in development. 
But finding an effective vaccine is only 
part of the challenge. When it’s discovered, 
infectious disease experts are predicting a 
scramble for limited doses, because there 
won’t be enough to vaccinate everyone on 
Day One. And deploying it could be difficult, 
particularly in countries that lack robust 
medical infrastructure. 
Those that have begun human trials in-
clude a research project at Oxford University 
in England, which hopes to have its vaccine 
ready in the fall. The university started 
human trials on April 23. ‘‘In normal times,’’ 
British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, 
‘‘reaching this stage would take years.’’ 
Conference participants expressed hope 
that by working together, the world will find 
solutions more quickly—and they can then 
be dispersed to all countries, not only the 
wealthy, or those that developed vaccines 
first. 
Many of the leaders stressed their support 
for the WHO. President Trump announced 
last month he was cutting off U.S. funding 
for the WHO because he said it had sided too 
closely with China, where the coronavirus 
arose. Trump says Chinese leaders under-
played the threat and hid crucial facts. 
Public health analysts have shared some of 
those criticisms but have also criticized 
Trump for cutting off funding. 
Peter Jay Hotez, dean of the National 
School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor Col-
lege of Medicine, said the United States has 
always been the primary funder of new prod-
ucts for global health. The country invested 
$1.8 billion in neglected diseases in 2018, ac-
cording to Policy Cures Research, more than 
two-thirds of the worldwide total. 
Hotez said the United States shoulders the 
burden of investing in global health tech-
nologies, while countries such as China do 
not step up. 
‘‘More than one mechanism for supporting 
global health technologies—that may not be 
such as a bad thing,’’ he said. ‘‘If it was all 
under one umbrella, you risk that some 
strong-willed opinions would carry the day 
and you might not fund the best tech-
nology.’’ 
Hotez is working on a coronavirus vaccine 
that uses an existing, low-cost technology, 
previously used for the hepatitis B vaccine, 
precisely because he is worried about equi-
table distribution of the vaccine. 
‘‘I’m not very confident that some of the 
cutting-edge technologies going into clinical 
trials, which have never led to a licensed 
vaccine before, are going to filter down to 
low- and middle-income countries anytime 
soon,’’ Hotez said. ‘‘I’m really worried.’’ 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to add one last thing. Yesterday, 
we had a telephone conference with 
Bill and Melinda Gates. They were part 
of the summit that the U.S. Govern-
ment boycotted, and they pledged to 
spend $125 million of their own money 
in this fight to find a virus vaccine as 
quickly as possible. Let’s join them. 
Let’s join them as a nation—Demo-
crats, Republicans, Independents, those 
who vote and those who don’t—all of us 
who understand that the sooner this 
vaccine is found, the sooner it is prov-
en safe, and the sooner it is distrib-
uted, it will be the best for America 
and for the rest of the world. It isn’t 
just America first. It is America in-
volved, America committed, America 
willing to work with the world to find 
a solution to one of the greatest public 
health crises of our time. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

IMMIGRATION 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today in the midst of 
this national crisis, this pandemic, to 
talk about one hero among, of course, 
many. 
First, I thank my friend Senator 
DURBIN for his tireless leadership on a 
very important topic—and that is the 
topic of immigration—and for his tak-
ing the lead in bringing us together 
today to recognize heroes in healthcare 
during this coronavirus pandemic. 
As many of you know, this pandemic 
is personal for me. My husband John 
was hospitalized with the coronavirus 
not too long ago, and although he is a 
great person and I am so proud of him 
for coming through it all and giving his 
plasma recently, he is actually not the 
hero I am referring to. I am talking 
about an immigrant doctor who is on 
the frontlines of the coronavirus pan-
demic in Rochester, MN. She has asked 
that her name not be used publicly be-
cause she is applying for a green card. 
She came to the United States from 
her home country for postgraduate 
medical training and completed not 
one but two fellowships in critical care 
and pulmonary diseases at the Mayo 
Clinic, which happens to be where my 
husband gave the plasma, which we 
hope will save other lives. 
Under normal circumstances, an im-
migrant doctor who completes his or 
her 
postgraduate 
training 
in 
the 
United States has to leave the country 
for at least 2 years when their resi-
dency is complete. Now, let’s look at 
that again. They have studied in an 
American medical school, they have 
completed their postgraduate training 
in the United States, but then they 
have to leave the country for 2 years 
when their residency is complete, just 
at a time when we need more doctors 
and more healthcare professionals and 
not less. Why? Because our immigra-
tion laws require them to be outside of 
the country for 2 years before they can 
apply to come back here on a work 
visa. But under the Conrad 30 program, 
doctors—and that is named after Kent 
Conrad, the Senator who once rep-
resented North Dakota. Since he left, I 
have taken this on, with many of my 
colleagues, to continue this program 
and make sure it gets reauthorized, 
and we would like to see it expanded. 
Why did he get involved in this in 
North Dakota? Well, that is because 
they had a shortage of doctors in rural 
areas, and under the Conrad 30 pro-
gram, doctors who commit to caring 
for patients in an underserved area like 
rural communities or other areas that 
may be underserved, including urban 
areas, if they face a shortage of doc-
tors, these doctors are allowed to start 
practicing in the United States imme-
diately without having to wait 2 years. 
I just keep repeating this. They got 
their training in the United States. 
They got degrees in the United States. 
That is why for years I have led bipar-
tisan legislation—which has been en-
dorsed by the American Medical Asso-
ciation, the American Hospital Asso-
ciation, and the National Rural Health 
Association—that would extend this 
program and allow international doc-
tors trained in the United States to re-
main in the country if—if—they prac-
tice in underserved areas. 
It was through this program that this 
hero I am talking about today, this im-
migrant doctor, was able to stay in

Minnesota and eventually began prac-
ticing at the Mayo Clinic as a critical 
care specialist, where she sees patients 
from all over rural areas of southern 
Minnesota. She was working in the in-
tensive 
care 
unit 
when 
the 
first 
coronavirus 
cases 
started 
coming 
through the door. 
Critical care and pulmonary disease 
specialists are some of the most in-de-
mand doctors during this pandemic, 
and as one of these specialists, this 
doctor has been managing patients on 
ventilators, patients with kidney fail-
ure, and patients with blood clots. She 
has cared for coronavirus patients on 
oxygen, and she manages the team that 
resuscitates 
patients 
whose 
hearts 
have stopped. This immigrant doctor 
has literally saved lives. 
Her hospital regularly provides tele-
medical support to other Mayo Clinic 
facilities, and they even helped a hos-
pital in Georgia. And when the Mayo 
Clinic received clearance to provide as-
sistance to a hospital in the Bronx 
where the medical staff was stretched 
dangerously thin, as we see on TV 
every single day, she volunteered. This 
immigrant doctor volunteered during 
her free time using the hospital’s tele-
medicine equipment. Talking about her 
service during this pandemic, she has 
said: ‘‘This is not a job, this is a call-
ing. We do this for love.’’ 
Her requirement to work in an under-
served area as a condition of the Con-
rad 30 program ends this year. She has 
no plans to move and to leave our 
country and to stop providing care to 
patients if she can help it. She said: ‘‘I 
love Minnesota. I hope Mayo never lets 
me go.’’ I hope that too. She is an 
American hero, and we could use a lot 
more like her. 
Over the last 15 years, the Conrad 30 
program has brought more than 15,000 
doctors to underserved areas, including 
many rural areas that are short on doc-
tors and rely on the program to fill the 
gap. I have been at VA hospitals in 
other parts of the country, and their 
No. 1 ask was this because they don’t 
have enough doctors in the rural areas 
where their clinics are located to serve 
their patients. 
This is a commonsense program with 
bipartisan support. I introduced a bill 
to reauthorize the program, which we 
have successfully done in the past. I in-
troduced a bill to reauthorize it with 
Senator COLLINS and Senator ROSEN, 
and it has 15 cosponsors. Listen to the 
names here: Senators KING, ERNST, 
CRAMER, COONS, BLUNT, CAPITO, BALD-
WIN, WYDEN, THUNE, MERKLEY, WICKER, 
CARPER, and PAUL. What brings all 
these Senators together? It is not a 
common ideological belief on many 
issues; it is because they are looking 
out for their States, and they want to 
save the lives of people in their States, 
especially during this pandemic, by al-
lowing doctors who have been trained 
in the United States of America, who 
have gotten their degrees, who have 
done their residencies here, to be able 
to stay in our country. 
Today I am asking all my colleagues 
to support its inclusion in the next 
piece of legislation that is coming our 
way that we must pass to address the 
coronavirus. 
I have also called on the administra-
tion to take action to increase the 
number of doctors who are here to help 
fight this pandemic and help alleviate 
the serious strain this pandemic has 
placed on our healthcare system. 
First, U.S. Citizenship and Immigra-
tion Services should resume expedited 
processing for employment-based visas 
for doctors. On March 20, USCIS an-
nounced a freeze on expedited proc-
essing during the pandemic, which 
would exacerbate our shortage of doc-
tors, especially in underserved rural 
areas. With Representative BRADLEY 
SCHNEIDER from Illinois, I led a bipar-
tisan group of 24 Senators—I again 
thank Senator DURBIN, who has been 
such a leader on these issues, for his 
support for this—and 13 Members of the 
House in asking USCIS to expedite 
processing for doctors again. We still 
haven’t received a response. 
Let’s think about what has been hap-
pening since we sent that letter on 
March 20—the increasing number of 
deaths in the assisted living homes, in-
cluding those in rural areas, which 
have been plagued by this pandemic, 
which have lost dozens of their resi-
dents to this pandemic. Think about 
some of the rural areas that have been 
hit hard that simply don’t have the 
hospital beds or the ventilators. Think 
about all that is going on, the thou-
sands and thousands of people who 
have lost their lives. And still we wait. 
March 20—a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators has asked for help since that 
freeze on March 20 was put into place. 
We await a response. 
Second, USCIS should give flexibility 
to health systems so that doctors on 
employment-based visas, like the Min-
nesota doctor, the hero I just told you 
about today who couldn’t even have 
her name released when she is man-
aging teams of people—not because she 
is here illegally, no; because she wants 
that chance to get her green card. Like 
that doctor whom I told you about 
today who can provide care where they 
need it the most, many doctors in simi-
lar circumstances are willing to volun-
teer to treat patients in the hardest hit 
areas, just like she did when she volun-
teered to help with the hospital in the 
Bronx. They are worried that doing so 
and leaving their home hospital will 
put their immigration status in jeop-
ardy. 
Last month, I led a letter with Rep-
resentative 
TOM
COLE, 
ABBY 
FINKENAUER from Iowa, and BRADLEY 
SCHNEIDER, that was signed by 18 other 
Senators—again, 
including 
Senator 
DURBIN and 29 House Members—urging 
USCIS to waive restrictions so that 
doctors can practice in crisis locations. 
Once again, we have not received a re-
sponse. Is that because the President 
wants to take a back seat again to the 
Governors of this country, when, in 
fact, Federal policy is holding back not 
just equipment from going where we 
have hot spots but now also actual doc-
tors and medical personnel? And if 
they are good enough to get a degree in 
a medical school in the United States 
and if they are good enough to practice 
in some areas of the country, they are 
not good enough to practice where we 
have the hot spots? 
Rather than acknowledging the help 
that immigrant doctors are providing 
during this public health emergency, 
this 
administration’s 
rhetoric 
has 
made them feel, well, unwelcome. That 
would be a euphemism. It is one of the 
reasons that Minnesota doctor asked 
that I not use her name. 
When discussing the process of apply-
ing for a work visa, she noted: ‘‘At the 
same time you’re taking boards [med-
ical boards] you are also filling out 
hundreds of pages of paperwork to 
prove that you’re worth keeping.’’ 
OK, picture this. While she is saving 
lives, managing the team that resusci-
tates people, volunteering her time to 
help at the hospital in the Bronx, car-
ing for patients on ventilators and 
bringing their hearts back to life, she 
somehow has to prove to our govern-
ment that she is someone worth keep-
ing. She said: It is very disheartening 
at times. 
But she isn’t giving up on us. She 
said: All of us who come from foreign 
countries, we are here because we want 
to be here. We love this country. 
For these brave men and women, it is 
so important that we do everything we 
can to protect them and their loved 
ones, not just from the uncertainty 
that comes with being immigrants but 
the risk of the current crisis. 
So many of our immigrant medical 
personnel have died, not just in our 
country but in other parts of the world 
as well. They have died saving lives for 
people in the country that they love. 
We need to ensure that all our doc-
tors and frontline health workers have 
supplies 
and 
equipment, 
like 
face 
masks, gowns, and shoe covers, so that 
no one has to reuse their supplies and 
risk exposure to the virus. 
We need to implement a real national 
testing strategy so that we can get 
ahead of the virus and target resources 
accordingly. The testing blueprint an-
nounced by the administration on 
April 27 falls well short of a com-
prehensive testing plan and puts all re-
sponsibility for testing on the States. 
Two weeks ago, I was proud that we 
passed an interim relief package that 
included $25 billion to expand our Na-
tion’s coronavirus testing capacity. It 
will go a long way to ramp up molec-
ular 
and 
serum 
testing—something 
that Mayo was a leader in across the 
country—to diagnose active virus in-
fections, identify antibiotics against 
the virus, and support contact tracing. 
This investment is a start, but we 
know there is so much more work to be 
done to ensure Americans across the

country have access to accurate test-
ing technologies and innovative treat-
ments that they need to reduce the 
risk of infection. 
Our 
healthcare 
workers 
on 
the 
frontlines, including our immigrant 
health heroes who sacrifice so much in 
the pursuit of medicine and service, de-
serve better. When the President goes 
after immigrants in his press con-
ference, do you know whom I keep 
thinking of? I keep thinking of this 
doctor, this hero in my home State 
who risks her life every day managing 
these patients and managing teams of 
doctors because of her know-how and 
because of the trust that an institution 
like the Mayo Clinic has put in her. 
What are we thinking? These heroes 
should be heralded and not condemned. 
In closing, I want to share this quote 
from President Franklin Roosevelt: 
‘‘Courage is not the absence of fear, but 
rather the assessment that something 
else is more important than fear.’’ 
That is exactly what these immigrant 
health heroes are doing. They chose to 
be in this country and to come here be-
cause, yes, they wanted a good life for 
themselves and their families, and they 
knew they were going to have to work 
hard to make that happen. They got a 
degree. They are on the frontlines. 
Then they chose to keep working and 
to save lives during an incredibly dan-
gerous pandemic. 
They understand that courage is not 
the absence of fear—of course, they are 
afraid when they go to those jobs—but, 
rather, the assessment that something 
else is more important than fear. Their 
life’s mission, to them, is more impor-
tant 
than 
fear. 
Saving 
someone’s 
grandma or saving someone’s hus-
band—they decided that is more impor-
tant to them than fear. They choose 
service over fear. 
What I am asking our colleagues to 
do here is—we understand there is anti- 
immigrant sentiment out there. We 
know it. We hear it every day from the 
President. But I am asking you to ac-
tually believe that your service is more 
important than that fear that has been 
stoked. Certainly, a number of our col-
leagues decided that when they were 
willing to get on that bill—Democrats 
and Republicans—to reauthorize the 
Conrad 30 program to allow these im-
migrant heroes, these doctors who were 
trained in our country, to be able to 
keep doing their work. Let me again 
mention the names of the cosponsors of 
this bill: COLLINS, ROSEN, KING, ERNST, 
CRAMER, COONS, BLUNT, CAPITO, BALD-
WIN, WYDEN, THUNE, MERKLEY, WICKER, 
CARPER, and PAUL, and, of course, I 
mentioned Senator DURBIN. They are 
willing to do that, and there is so much 
more we can do. We still await an an-
swer for why the visa processing for 
these healthcare workers was sus-
pended. 
Service first, fear last—that is what 
these doctors did, and that is what we 
must do first. That is what we must do 
now. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CARES ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
take this time to go over with my col-
leagues the status of where we are in 
regard to the provisions in the CARES 
Act that relate to small businesses. 
First, I want to make it clear that 
our top priority for America’s busi-
nesses, whether they be small busi-
nesses or large businesses, is to get this 
COVID–19 behind us, to stop the spread 
of this deadly disease, and to give con-
fidence back to the American people 
that it is safe to pursue their economic 
desires and therefore to have busi-
nesses be able to go back to a situation 
where they have customers and they 
can be open for business. We have ap-
propriated 
significant 
resources 
in 
order to make sure we do what is right 
financially to deal with this deadly dis-
ease, and we have provided the tools to 
protect our economy. 
Let me talk a little bit about the at-
tention to small business. I am pleased 
and proud to be the ranking Democrat 
on the Small Business and Entrepre-
neurship Committee. I serve with Sen-
ator RUBIO, who is the chairman of the 
committee. We have worked together, 
Democrats and Republicans, in order to 
help small businesses during this pan-
demic. We did that because we under-
stand that small businesses do not 
have the same degree of financial resil-
iency that larger companies have. 
When they are going through an emer-
gency situation, when they are going 
through a pandemic, they don’t have 
the same capacity to get credit and to 
get the cash they need that larger com-
panies have. 
We also understand that small busi-
ness is where the job creation mostly 
will take place in our country. Most 
jobs are created through smaller com-
panies. We also understand that small-
er companies are more innovative. 
They come up with new and creative 
ways in order to build our economy. 
But we recognized that we had to do 
something to make sure they could 
survive through the pandemic, and 
that is where the CARES Act came in. 
On a bipartisan basis, we crafted new 
tools under the Small Business Admin-
istration to help small businesses. I 
was proud to work with Senator RUBIO, 
Senator SHAHEEN, and Senator COL-
LINS. The four of us got together well 
before the CARES Act was brought to 
the floor of the U.S. Senate in order to 
deal with what is necessary to keep 
small businesses afloat during the pan-
demic. New tools were created, and the 
CARES Act enacted tools that can help 
small businesses survive this pandemic. 
The program that is getting the most 
attention is the Paycheck Protection 
Program, the PPP program. In the 
original CARES Act, we authorized and 
appropriated $349 billion for that pro-
gram, and then we replenished in a sec-
ond round an additional $310 billion, for 
a total of $659 billion for the PPP pro-
gram. 
It is a program in which small busi-
nesses go to their financial institution 
and take out a 7(a) loan, which is a 
loan that is provided for under the 
Small Business Act, but there are pri-
vate lenders that lend the money to 
the small businesses. But we made spe-
cial provisions in this law to provide 
100 percent Federal guarantee so that 
there is no risk to the borrower. We 
made it easier for companies to be able 
to get those 7(a) loans and provided ad-
ditional lenders for other communities. 
We expanded the 7(a) program to in-
clude not only conventional, for-profit 
small businesses but also nonprofit 
businesses, as well as individual propri-
etors. 
To date, the program has been very 
successful. Over 4 million 7(a) loans 
have been made under the Paycheck 
Protection Program. But we have con-
cerns. Let me talk a little bit about 
the concerns we have. 
One of our concerns is that it has 
been difficult for the underserved com-
munity, the underbanked community, 
to be able to get these 7(a) loans as a 
priority. We failed them in the first 
round. It was the larger companies 
that had established relationships with 
their banks that got priority on the 
processing of these loans, so that mi-
nority businesses, women-owned busi-
nesses, businesses located in rural com-
munities, 
and 
veteran-owned 
busi-
nesses did not receive the same atten-
tion as the larger businesses did. 
So our first priority is to find out ex-
actly how the program is working. We 
need to get the data. We need to know 
where these loans were made. We need 
to know what industries got the dif-
ferent loans. We need to know the loca-
tion of these loans. We need to know 
the size by dollar value and by number 
of employees. 
We also need to know how the dif-
ferent provisions of the PPP program 
have been allocated by loans. For ex-
ample, we made exceptions on the 500- 
employee limit for those companies 
that come under the NAICS code 72— 
this is our hospitality industry—and 
for good reason: They are really hurt-
ing during this time. 
We need to know how many hotels 
and how many restaurants qualified 
under the NAICS code exception. We 
need to know how many franchisees 
have been able to get loans. We need to 
know how much went to the nonprofit 
community and how much went to the 
self-employed community. For that 
reason, I have introduced legislation 
with Senator SHAHEEN
and Senator 
SCHUMER to require the SBA to make

S2273 
May 6, 2020 
that information available to us on a 
very regular basis. We need to get that 
information in order to properly carry 
out our oversight function. 
Today, the Small Business Com-
mittee in the Senate had a briefing 
with Secretary Mnuchin and Adminis-
trator Carranza, and we talked about 
one of the problems we have in admin-
istering this law. There is a self-certifi-
cation; that is, the business makes the 
certification that they meet the stand-
ards and need under the act. We are 
concerned that there may have been 
abuses. But until we see the informa-
tion, it is difficult for us to do our re-
spective oversight. 
We don’t know if we still have ade-
quate funding. To date, there has been 
somewhere around—over $500 billion, 
closer to $600 billion has already been 
lent out; $550-some billion has already 
been lent out under this program. Are 
we going to need more money? Until 
we get this information, we don’t know 
what the future funding needs are 
going to be. So we need to be able to 
get that information so we can provide 
adequate resources. 
I must tell you that I think every 
Member of the Senate has been ap-
proached with ways this program can 
be made better. There are questions as 
to why certain groups are eligible and 
others are not. There is going to be a 
need for modification in this program, 
and it will be difficult for us to make 
those modifications unless we get the 
data we need to understand where the 
loans have been made. 
There is a second program that was 
created under the CARES Act and ex-
panded under the CARES Act, and that 
is the EIDL Program, the Economic In-
jury Disaster Loan Program, and we 
added a grant program to that. The ini-
tial CARES Act provided $10 billion. 
When we went through the second 
round of funding, we put another $60 
billion into this program. Why did we 
do that? Because the loan program 
under EIDL, which is an emergency 
program for businesses that have suf-
fered disasters, and COVID–19 qualifies 
as that, gives relief beyond just the 8 
weeks of payroll and the other ex-
penses covered under the PPP program. 
So small businesses need help with 
working capital. They can get that 
help under the EIDL Loan Program. A 
small business might need an imme-
diate influx of cash. They can get that 
under the grant program under EIDL, 
up to $10,000. 
Yes, when the programs were an-
nounced, they were overprescribed. We 
had over 1 million small businesses 
make immediate applications for these 
funds, and the Small Business Adminis-
tration was overwhelmed. That is why 
we provided, in addition to the original 
$10 billion for the grant program, an-
other $10 billion. And in addition to the 
loaning capacity, we put another $50 
billion into that program so they could 
execute $300 billion worth of loans. 
But it has been very slow at the SBA, 
which is a concern of ours. Only about 
50,000 loans have been successfully 
processed under EIDL. We just got that 
information today. Yes, there have 
been over 1 million grants given out. 
Most of them have been under $10,000, 
whereas the maximum we thought 
most small businesses would get is a 
$10,000 grant. 
There needs to be better coordination 
between the PPP program and the 
EIDL Program, and we must make sure 
that the window remains open. But, 
today, a non-agricultural business that 
applies for an EIDL loan is told that 
they can’t process that loan, that the 
window is basically closed. That is not 
the intent of Congress. We want to 
make sure those windows are open. 
So I come here today to tell you that 
the first priority is that we need to get 
the facts, and we need to fix the pro-
gram to make sure it works well. But 
I want to qualify that by saying how 
proud we are of the men and women at 
the SBA and Treasury. They are imple-
menting this new program literally 
overnight and working 24 hours a day 
in order to make sure this program can 
work. We recognize that, and we recog-
nize this is a major challenge, but we 
need to make sure the program works 
right. 
We 
need 
oversight 
and 
account-
ability, and we can’t do that oversight 
and accountability unless we get all of 
the facts and unless we get the infor-
mation. Those who abuse the program 
need to be held accountable. I was 
pleased to hear Secretary Mnuchin 
talk about that today in the briefing to 
our committee. We have to have over-
sight as to the program working effi-
ciently. We also have to make sure 
that we take care of the problems that 
we have seen in the program with the 
underserved community. We can do a 
better job in reaching those businesses 
that are traditionally underserved. 
We specifically allocated $60 billion 
of PPP to smaller financial institu-
tions. We now need to make sure they 
really get to the institutions that can 
serve minority small businesses, that 
can serve those smaller of the small 
businesses, that can serve women- 
owned businesses and veteran-owned 
businesses and businesses located in 
rural communities. 
I would suggest that we need to make 
sure that the CDFIs and minority de-
pository institutions get their fair 
share of allocations under the PPP pro-
gram in order to reach these hard-to- 
serve small businesses. 
Yes, we do need to look at how we 
can modify the program to make it 
work even better. We recognize that 
when we crafted the program, we 
thought that 8 weeks would be enough. 
We now know that our economy in 
most of the country is not going to be 
up and running within that 8-week pe-
riod. How do we improve that program? 
I want to tell you that we all recog-
nize that the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram may not be enough. Even in con-
junction with the EIDL program, it 
may not be enough because businesses 
are not returning to normal within the 
next few weeks. We need to design a 
program that provides the next level of 
relief to those small businesses that 
really need it, those that have had sig-
nificant revenue losses, those small 
businesses that are really small busi-
nesses, 
like 
the 
mom-and-pop-type 
businesses, and, yes, those small busi-
nesses that have traditionally been left 
out—the minority-owned businesses, 
and women-owned businesses, and busi-
nesses in smaller, rural communities, 
and veteran-owned businesses. 
The success of the PPP program and 
the success of the EIDL program were 
because Democrats and Republicans 
worked together in a strong bipartisan 
manner. We are continuing to do that 
in the Small Business Committee. 
I applaud our leader, Senator RUBIO, 
for reaching out to work together be-
tween Democrats and Republicans. We 
need to continue to work together and 
enact the type of oversight that is nec-
essary for the programs that are cur-
rently existing and make the modifica-
tions so these programs can work effec-
tively and well. 
We heard today about the inflexi-
bility of the 8-week period and how we 
need to deal with that. We need to 
work together to improve the program 
and to make sure that the next level of 
help for small businesses is targeted to 
those small businesses that really need 
the help so that we can continue to 
have an economy that can grow, that 
can create jobs, that can be innovative, 
and that protects the ability of small 
business owners to be able to partici-
pate in our economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, let 
me first of all join with my good friend, 
Senator CARDIN, in appreciating the in-
credible work that really so many Fed-
eral employees have done to make 
these programs work. 
I was with the SBA Director about 2 
weeks ago on Friday. She said that in 
the first 14 days of the PPP program 
they did 14 months of loans in that 14- 
day period. I thought many times that 
Secretary Mnuchin set these high 
standards for how quickly we would get 
to each of these points and probably 
only later realized just how difficult it 
is to get the Federal Government to 
move. 
In this case, the Federal Government 
has moved. The Congress has moved 
working together. We didn’t have the 
element of time on our side. We really 
had to move quickly. I think we all 
knew when we were doing so that we 
were going to have some miscalcula-
tions, whether it was the amount of 
money for PPP or a program that 
wasn’t quite as refined as it needed to 
be. And, hopefully, we are right now 
trying to look at not only how we have 
filled in the blanks on the programs 
that we so quickly dealt with in March, 
but also to look forward to May and 
July and try to figure out what the

economy is going to need and where we 
are going to be in this healthcare crisis 
in May and July. 
Certainly, a number of our States are 
beginning to reopen. States like Mis-
souri are opening in what I think is ex-
actly the appropriate way. The Gov-
ernor looked at the whole State and 
said: We are going to step back from 
our initial order in the entire State. 
We are going to remove that order. He 
has worked thoughtfully and carefully 
with the mayor of St. Louis and the 
mayor of Kansas City, the county ex-
ecutives of bigger counties, and the 
mayors of Columbia and Springfield, 
and he has not gotten into fights with 
local officials about situations where 
they have every reason to know more 
than he does, just like the Governor of 
Missouri has every reason to know 
more than somebody in Washington, 
DC, about when our State should re-
open. 
I am glad the President has let Gov-
ernors have that sort of authority. I 
think in most States, including mine, 
Governors have stepped back and let 
local officials assert their view of what 
should happen in the area where they 
have been elected to be responsible. 
With that combination of things, we 
are going to reopen and begin to see 
the economy reconnect again like it 
has not connected for the last couple of 
months. 
At the same time, we have these two 
fights. One is to save the economy and 
one is this important fight against the 
virus. I think in the 2 months since we 
went home after the CARES Act, I 
spent most of my time working on the 
healthcare side of this. Senator ALEX-
ANDER is the authorizing chairman for 
these healthcare programs. I am the 
appropriating chairman for most of 
them. These are programs that, cer-
tainly, in the last months, Americans 
have learned a lot more about than 
they ever knew about before. Who 
knew the Centers for Disease Control, 
or the CDC, was doing what it was 
doing or that Health and Human Serv-
ices has the responsibility they have or 
how troublesome it was if we let our 
hospitals get out of whack in terms of 
income and continuing expenses? All of 
those things happen. 
One of the things I worked hard on 
has been to get that research funding 
at the National Institutes of Health, 
where Dr. Fauci runs only one of the 
double handful of agencies at NIH, the 
infectious disease part of that. 
The American people are beginning 
to see those things that the govern-
ment does and also see that the govern-
ment, like every other family or every 
other institution, doesn’t respond to 
crisis with immediate efficiency, but 
does begin to work its way toward a so-
lution. Senator ALEXANDER and I have 
spent a lot of time together with FDA 
and all those other agencies. What we 
see happening is a real willingness with 
the total backing of the Congress to 
get out there and try to move these so-
lutions at a faster rate than we ever 
have before. Dr. Fauci said early on 
that if we developed a vaccine in 18 
months, that would be the world record 
for a U.S.-developed vaccine from a 
new virus to having a vaccine avail-
able. 
We are trying to do everything we 
can, not only to meet that potential 
world record but to beat that world 
record. How are we doing that? We are 
doing that with things like the shark 
tank concept at NIH, which we specifi-
cally put $1 billion behind in the last 
bill—$1 billion for a place where people 
would bring ideas for a vaccine, for 
therapy, for testing, and you would 
have that shark tank environment 
begin to evaluate which of those ideas 
deserve the help of the Federal Govern-
ment to push them forward faster. 
How would we push them forward 
faster? Obviously, a vaccine is what we 
need to fully emerge, in my view, from 
this. We need therapies to deal with 
people who get the virus before we have 
the vaccine and testing to know if you 
had it or not. Hopefully, we would have 
some level of immunity or testing to 
know whether you have it. We have to 
do better on all of those fronts. 
We need tests that are easier to take 
and get a quick response. We need mil-
lions of these tests that millions of 
Americans will take more than once. If 
you are at a factory, if you are in a 
close situation, or if you are on a col-
lege campus, the administrator or the 
boss or you may decide: I want to take 
that test every week, and I want to call 
my mother every week from this col-
lege campus and tell her I have taken 
the test again like I told you I would. 
I was OK last week. I am still feeling 
OK. Nobody in my dorm is sick. It is 
OK that I am here. 
That is the kind of thing that will 
get us started. How do we get to that 
quick, easy response test? How do we 
get to that therapy, and how would the 
shark tank work? 
People bring in ideas. Let’s assume 
on testing that the shark tank decides 
there are really 10 of these that have 
real potential to work and we are going 
to begin to advance them. Then, at 
some point, there are four of them that 
are still one or two steps away from 
being fully vetted, but you don’t want 
to wait until they are fully vetted to 
go into production. That is where an-
other billion dollars in an agency 
called BARDA is. Take that billion dol-
lars and find a private partner and say 
that we are going to produce all four of 
these tests. We are going to have all 
four of these tests ready 30 days from 
now when we know which one works 
because 30 days really matters—30 days 
in getting back to school, 30 days in 
generating the economy. If you are 30 
days ahead of where you would have 
been otherwise, you can put a lot of 
money behind that and still pay only a 
fraction of what we have been putting 
behind trying to stabilize the economy. 
If two of them work in that 30-day pe-
riod of time when you are going ahead 
and manufacturing all four of them, 
they are just ready quicker than they 
would have been otherwise. 
We hear often the idea that failure is 
not an option. This is a case where ac-
tually failure is almost a certainty on 
some of the things you are trying. If 
you are not failing, you are not trying 
enough things. If all you did was ad-
vance four things that were going to 
work anyway, you really didn’t take 
much of a chance to fast forward or 
dual-track what you are trying to do. 
We are working hard to get ready to 
have those tests so when you have a 
normal blood draw to check your cho-
lesterol, when you turn that into your 
doctor, you could ask your doctor to 
also check for COVID–19 if they don’t 
ask you if you want to check for 
COVID–19. They could say you have it. 
Hopefully, by the time that test is 
available, they can say you have it and 
you have enough of the antibodies or 
you have enough of what it took to 
fight this off that you should have im-
munity up until the time we are likely 
to have a vaccine. Many Americans 
then know they are out there with no 
danger to themselves or no danger to 
others. Many Americans then know 
that, in all likelihood, they can safely 
visit somebody they haven’t been vis-
iting for a while because they didn’t 
want to take a chance of carrying a 
virus that now they know they can’t 
possibly get. So those kinds of things 
will make a real difference in our econ-
omy. 
On therapeutics, if we don’t have the 
vaccine for it yet and if you get the 
disease, we need to find and fast for-
ward the manufacturer of the thera-
peutics that we think are most likely 
to work. 
It is the same with vaccines. On all 
those fronts, we are making headway. I 
think we are probably testing sophisti-
cated testing for the antibodies and for 
a diagnostic test. We are having lots of 
interest in that. There is a lot of pri-
vate sector interest for an antibody 
test, for this coronavirus test, where 
particularly, if scientists can say that 
you have it and you have this level of 
antibody that you can’t get it again. 
Who wouldn’t want to take that test? 
The authorizing chairman of the Ap-
propriating 
Committee, 
Senator 
SHELBY, Senator ALEXANDER, Senator 
MURRAY, and I all believe that the gov-
ernment should pay for that test. We 
have said the government should pay 
for that test if your insurance company 
will not. Most insurance companies 
said they would pay for that test. It 
seems to me that if you have millions 
of customers and a guaranteed payer, 
this is one that the private sector is 
quickly about to take care of on their 
own. Thank goodness for that. This is 
one of those times when the most so-
phisticated 
pharmaceutical-medical 
science laboratory system in the world 
begins to pay off. That is what we are 
going to see here. 
We have other areas where companies 
are working together like they haven’t 
before. I know they told our friends at

the National Institutes of Health that 
if we can test their experiment better 
at our facility than they can, bring it 
over here to test it over here. We need 
an all-out effort to get this economy 
going again. We need an all-out effort 
to get people’s health secure. Once that 
has happened, I think we will see all 
those things come together. 
I think we made great strides. I 
haven’t heard anybody say in some 
time on this issue that Congress just 
hasn’t provided enough resources to do 
this job on the testing, therapeutics, 
and the medical device side of this or 
the personal protective equipment side 
of this. People looked at what the Con-
gress has stepped up and done and said 
the Congress has given us the tools. 
The administration, the research of 
scientists of America, American phar-
maceutical companies, and the medical 
companies have to step in. I believe 
they are stepping in. Let’s break some 
records here. Let’s do some things 
quicker with the same amount of safe-
ty that we have done in the past. There 
is a dynamic need to do this. The 
American people understand why it 
needs to be done. People all over the 
world will benefit from our leadership 
here. I think we are seeing it. 
Hopefully, we can continue on these 
efforts to have the bipartisan deter-
mination to win these two fights: the 
fight against the virus and the fight for 
the economy that the American people 
deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, be-
fore our colleague and friend from Mis-
souri leaves the floor, I want to thank 
him for a very thoughtful presentation. 
I want to thank him for that and for 
his leadership. I know he has other 
places to go. I am glad I was here to 
hear that. 
I wasn’t sure if I would continue 
wearing my mask. I saw the Presiding 
Officer was wearing theirs and I said: 
Well, I will keep wearing mine, too. All 
our staff on the floor, including one of 
the staff who takes down our words for 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and folks 
who accept documents at the desk in 
front of us are all wearing masks. I was 
wearing a mask earlier today going 
into a markup at a business meeting in 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee. They were also wearing 
masks. 
As I was about to go into the busi-
ness meeting, there was a Capitol po-
lice officer there. I said to her: How are 
you doing today? 
She said: I am doing fine. 
I said: Any idea how many of our 
Capitol police officers have been in-
fected and developed symptoms or had 
the virus at some point in recent 
weeks? 
She said: I believe it is somewhere 
between 15 and 20. 
This came as a surprise to me. We 
haven’t heard that much about it. I 
have been here to vote several times 
this afternoon. I was coming here to 
say a few words about legislation we 
passed unanimously out of the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee. 
I was passing a number of Capitol po-
lice officers, people who clean the 
building, maintain the building, and 
folks who serve food in the cafeteria so 
that the people who are working here 
have something to eat. They were al-
most 
without 
exception 
wearing 
masks. 
The reason why it is important for us 
to do that is because they are at risk. 
We, as leaders, need to exhibit and lead 
by our example. I know my colleagues 
endeavor to do that. It is important. 
These are people who serve our country 
just as we do. They deserve not just our 
respect and our thanks, but they de-
serve our protection. For everybody for 
whom maybe it is something they are 
uncomfortable 
doing, 
not 
used 
to 
doing, like hand sanitizing, washing 
their hands every other hour or even 
more, these are good things, not just 
for us but for the people who are serv-
ing this country here with us in our 
Nation’s Capital. 
I did come here today to say those 
words from my heart, and I wanted to 
share them with you and others. 
f 
AMERICA’S WATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 2020 
Mr. CARPER. I have come today to 
talk about a couple of bills that the 
Senate Committee on Environment and 
Public 
Works 
reported 
out 
today 
unanimously that would vastly im-
prove our Nation’s water infrastruc-
ture. What does infrastructure include? 
It includes the pipes that bring us our 
water or that take our wastewater 
where it can be treated. 
Infrastructure includes our dams, in-
cludes our harbors, our ports, our wa-
terways—all that and a whole lot more. 
When we talk about improving our 
water infrastructure, what we are real-
ly talking about is keeping the prom-
ises 
afforded 
to 
every 
American 
through the Declaration of Independ-
ence. 
Remember those words: life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness? The legis-
lation that we acted on today—the two 
bills that will be combined into one 
later on, on the floor—called the Water 
Resources Development Act, the under-
lying message is that our work today 
directly reflects those words in the 
Declaration of Independence: life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
Certainly, none of those things—life, 
liberty, the pursuit of happiness—are 
possible without access to clean water, 
whether it is to wash our hands or to 
drink. We can’t have life without clean 
water to drink. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has reminded us of that too— 
just how important it is to have access 
to clean water to wash our hands and 
soap to wash our hands. We are re-
minded daily—I would say almost 
hourly—to wash our hands with soap 
and water. It is a simple yet effective 
way to prevent the spread of this dead-
ly, virulent disease. 
In our committee today, the Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee, 
Senator SULLIVAN from Alaska talked 
about the Native Americans who live 
in his State who don’t have running 
water. They don’t have a spigot to turn 
on. They don’t even have the ability to 
flush toilets. For them, the idea that 
you can actually do those things is just 
a dream that they could never imagine 
being realized. The thing is that too 
many communities across our country 
do not have access to clean water be-
cause of harmful contamination in 
their groundwater or water supply 
pipes. 
Sadly, this public health disparity 
usually goes hand in hand with eco-
nomic opportunity. While water is the 
essence of life, it is also an essential 
part of our economy. More than 99 per-
cent of the U.S. overseas trade—more 
than 99 percent of U.S. overseas trade— 
moves through our waterways. Imagine 
that. Most people would never imagine 
that. Our Nation’s water infrastruc-
ture, our ports, our shipping channels, 
and other related projects support eco-
nomic growth, facilitate commerce, 
sustain jobs, and create new jobs as 
well. 
Americans cannot truly pursue hap-
piness without the economic oppor-
tunity that comes with having strong 
water infrastructure, a lot of which we 
can’t see—we have been joined on the 
floor by the chairman of our com-
mittee. There are pipes and wastewater 
treatment plants and the facilities that 
clean the water for us; we don’t see 
those. Fortunately, somebody does— 
somebody 
builds 
them, 
somebody 
maintains them—in order for us to 
have that life, liberty, and pursuit of 
happiness. 
Well, today, our committee, led by 
JOHN
BARRASSO, Senator from Wyo-
ming—I happen to have the privilege of 
being the ranking Democrat on that 
committee—we approved two bills that 
are going to help us keep those prom-
ises laid out in that Declaration of 
Independence—life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. 
America’s Water Infrastructure Act 
of 2020 and the Drinking Water Infra-
structure Act of 2020 will help the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers and the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency make 
improvements to key water infrastruc-
ture systems throughout our country. 
The programs we passed in our com-
mittee today will support the Army 
Corps of Engineers’ operation and 
maintenance of—listen to this—13,000 
miles of commercial, deep-draft ship 
channels—13,000 miles—and 12,000 miles 
of commercial inland waterways. 
I had explained earlier, Mr. Chair-
man, before you joined, how 99 percent 
of the cargo that we send to other 
countries or that comes to us comes by 
ship. It doesn’t come by airplanes; it 
doesn’t come by train. It comes by 
ships. Those ships don’t move without 
waterways largely maintained by the

Army Corps of Engineers. These are lit-
tle known projects that keep our econ-
omy moving. They are essential to our 
way of life as well. What comes into 
the Port of Los Angeles today will be 
on shelves in stores in the Midwest a 
day or so later. 
In Delaware, we have a port on the 
Delaware River. It is called the Port of 
Wilmington, not far from where my 
wife and I live. It supports more than 
19,000 jobs in our region. For a big 
State, 19,000 jobs is not much. For 
Delaware, that is a huge deal. 
The Port of Wilmington is the United 
States’ top seaport for fresh fruit im-
ports. If you happen to live in the east-
ern part of the United States and you 
got up and had cereal this morning 
with some banana on your cereal, there 
is a good chance that that banana 
came through Port Wilmington. 
The Army Corps is working dili-
gently with our port on an expansion 
project that will open a channel to a 
new containment facility just a couple 
miles north of the current port along 
the Delaware River. The Army Corps is 
responsible for dredging and maintain-
ing access to this new channel which, 
over time, will support more com-
merce, more jobs for our region—not 
just for our State, but for our region. 
For such a small State, if you were to 
stand and draw a circle around the 
house where my wife and I live, in 
about a 10-mile radius, you cover New 
Jersey, you cover Pennsylvania, you 
get pretty darn close to Maryland as 
well. So the impact will be regional. 
In addition to authorizing necessary 
Corps projects, the two bills that we re-
ported out of our committee today 
unanimously included authorizing the 
Clean Water Revolving Loan Fund for 
the first time since 1987. We used to be 
able to provide grant programs to fund 
water projects in States, to help fund 
water projects, to help fund wastewater 
treatment projects in our States, and 
we changed that when Ronald Reagan 
was President, and then we have these 
revolving loan funds. The Federal Gov-
ernment replenishes them every now 
and then. The States invest the money 
out of those funds, but we haven’t reau-
thorized the Clean Water Revolving 
Fund which focuses less on drinking 
water and more on cleaning water, re-
ducing the effluent it is putting out in 
our community. So many of our com-
munities rely on these funds to im-
prove their wastewater systems. 
In the drinking water bill, a cor-
ollary, we also authorized more than a 
half billion dollars to provide critical 
drinking water infrastructure through 
the Small and Disadvantaged Commu-
nities grant program. I just talked ear-
lier, when I spoke of Senator DAN SUL-
LIVAN’s 
comments 
at 
our 
hearing 
today, we talked about Native Amer-
ican communities in his State who 
don’t have flush toilets. In a number of 
cases, they don’t turn on the faucets 
and the clean water just comes out. 
There are other communities, not just 
there, in my State at one time, not 
long ago, in other States where there 
are disadvantaged communities, and 
we have a grant program that we are 
going to use to help more and more of 
them—not all of them—and this will 
help us keep the promise of clean and 
safe drinking water, maybe not for 
every American, but more Americans, 
no matter what their ZIP Code is or 
what kind of bank account they have. 
I think of Matthew 25—I don’t care 
what our faith is—Matthew 25 starts 
out with these words: When I was 
thirsty, did you give me a drink; when 
I was hungry, did you feed me? 
Well, when I was thirsty and I didn’t 
have any clean water to drink, what 
did you do about it? Well, in this bill, 
we do something about it, and I am 
proud of what we have done. 
As we work to ensure clean water for 
all, our drinking water bill will con-
tinue our work to address what are 
called ‘‘forever chemicals.’’ A forever 
chemical is a chemical that doesn’t de-
grade, and there is a word that is about 
a mile long—there are a couple of 
words that describe it—we call it 
PFAS. That is the acronym. I am not 
big on acronyms, but I like this one a 
lot. There are thousands of ‘‘forever 
chemicals’’ that just don’t degrade in 
our environment. For the most part, 
they are not dangerous, but a couple of 
them are really dangerous, and they 
can lead to thyroid and liver disorders. 
They can increase the risk of cancer. 
They can adversely affect people’s im-
mune systems. We have a pretty good 
idea of which ones they are, and we 
need to do something about it. 
We sought to do that early this year 
and late last year, through other legis-
lation. We have an opportunity with 
the bill that we reported out today to 
do more good work on addressing these 
forever chemicals. One of the ways is 
by developing a clean drinking water 
standard for two of them that are most 
concerning: PFOA and PFOS. Between 
today, reporting the bill out of com-
mittee, and the time we come back to 
the floor to debate it here, we have an 
opportunity, I hope, to do even more 
good work in addressing that. 
Madam President, I know you have a 
military base in your State. I have 
been to one or two of them. We have 
one big military base in our State, the 
Dover Air Force Base. It is the biggest 
employer in the central and southern 
part of our State: 6,000 uniformed and 
civilian personnel. They have some of 
the biggest planes in the world, C–5, C– 
17. It is a cargo base. It has been recog-
nized many times as the best cargo 
base in the world, best Air Force base 
in the world too. 
About 5, 6, 7 years ago, one of our C– 
5s 
took 
off—they 
fly 
around 
the 
world—they had a full load of fuel, full 
load of cargo, and as they took off, the 
flight engineer noticed that an engine 
light came on from one of the engines— 
not a good sign—and the flight engi-
neer turned off—not that engine— 
turned off another engine, and then he 
had two engines working and two en-
gines not working. 
Long story short, the airplane came 
around and tried to land again where it 
had just taken off. It crashed a mile 
short of the runway, and fortunately, 
nobody was killed. The fire department 
came rushing out and foamed down the 
area and helped put out the fire. No-
body died. 
I am sad to say that, when I was on 
Active Duty as a naval flight officer at 
a naval air station one morning, driv-
ing into work many years ago, there 
was a huge fire. One NASA airplane, 
big plane, landed on top of one of the 
Navy airplanes. It killed everybody. I 
think one person survived in the whole 
crash. Again, folks, firefighters rushed 
out and tried to save lives with this 
firefighting foam. 
The true irony is that the fire-
fighting foam which is used to save 
lives in air crashes actually, when it 
rains, it gets washed into the ground 
and a lot of times ends up in wells and 
groundwater that people drink and 
consume, and it creates very serious 
health results for them. 
At any rate, between today and the 
time our bills come to the floor, we 
hope to make a lot more progress in 
adjusting those for everyone. 
While millions of Americans rely on 
the Army Corps projects to safely navi-
gate our waters, stay safe from flood-
ing and storm damage, and reap the 
benefits of healthy aquatic ecosystems 
and marshlands, we know impacts of 
climate change propose a real threat to 
public safety and to the durability of 
our infrastructure. 
I would like to use the example of 
Ellicott City, MD—not even 30, 40 miles 
from here. A couple years ago, within 
18 months of each other, they had two 
1,000-year floods. What is a 1,000-year 
flood? It is a flood that is supposed to 
occur every 1,000 years. We had two of 
them within 18 months of each other, 
and we are seeing that kind of extreme 
weather in places all over the country, 
and not only does it wreak havoc at 
our homes and our businesses and our 
transportation system, but also our 
drinking water systems. 
One of the things that we do in our 
bill is to address that. These two bills 
expand grants that will help small and 
medium-sized 
communities 
increase 
the resiliency of their water systems to 
natural hazards and extreme weather, 
like what was experienced in Ellicott 
City and any number of places around 
our country. 
Before I yield the floor to my friend 
and colleague, our chairman, JOHN 
BARRASSO, who is patiently waiting for 
me to stop talking, I want to thank 
him again. I already thanked him once, 
but now that he is here, I want to 
thank him again. I want to thank him 
for his leadership and helping us to 
move this legislation through. We have 
all heard the saying—I think it was Joe 
Biden that said it—just because some-
body is my adversary or somebody is 
on the other side of the aisle, they 
don’t have to be my enemy. 
We are actually—don’t let this word 
get out in Wyoming—I think we could

say we are friends and we like to work 
together. Our staffs, most days, like to 
work together, hopefully. But I want to 
thank his staff. 
I want to thank all the Senators. He 
and I pleaded with our colleagues from 
all 50 States to give us their ideas of 
what should go into this bill, and a 
bunch of our colleagues—a majority of 
them—did that. So it is not just some-
thing we dreamed up in our committee, 
but had great input from a whole 
bunch of our colleagues, Democrats 
and Republicans, and we were able to 
put together a bill that passed our 
committee unanimously. 
I just want to mention the names of 
a couple of people on both sides of the 
aisle, and they include Richard Russell, 
Brian Clifford, Andy Harding, Lizzie 
Olsen, Susan Lucas, Craig Thomas, 
Beth Lange, Christina Rabuse, Matt 
Leggett, who worked for Senator BAR-
RASSO; and on my team, Mary Frances 
Repko, 
our 
staff 
director, 
Mark 
Mendenhall, Annie D’Amato, and John 
Kane, who works harder than just 
about any person I have ever had the 
privilege of working with. 
Lastly, Senator BARRASSO introduced 
me last year or so to a fellow from Wy-
oming who had been nominated to be a 
very senior official at the Commerce 
Department, and he had been nomi-
nated for a position where he would be 
Assistant Secretary of the Interior to 
handle, among other things, national 
parks, national wildlife refuges, fish 
and wildlife—big job, important job for 
all of our States—certainly mine and 
certainly Wyoming. 
During his testimony, Rob Wallace 
testified, I thought, so well, and it is 
hard not to like the guy. I liked him al-
most immediately, but he said these 
words to our committee. He said: Bi-
partisan solutions are lasting solu-
tions. That is what he said: Bipartisan 
solutions are lasting solutions. 
I sat there that day thinking: Boy, he 
nailed it. I have stolen that line—some-
times, I give him credit for it; some-
times, I don’t—but think about that. 
Bipartisan solutions are lasting solu-
tions. 
We need the lasting solutions. We es-
pecially need them with respect to 
making sure those words in the Dec-
laration of Independence—life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness—aren’t 
just words on a sheet of paper or old 
words on a piece of parchment, but 
they are real words today, and we have 
renewed our commitment to them, and 
we have done that with the legislation 
we reported out of our committee. 
We still have some work to do. Har-
bor maintenance, we need to try and 
resolve that—people have strong views, 
not always in sync with one another— 
and the legislation on forever chemi-
cals and how do we deal with that in 
ways that are smart and respect 
science and enable us to make sure 
that we better protect people’s health. 
So these bills, in closing, are a win, 
win, win, for our Nation’s economy, for 
our public health, and for our environ-
ment at a time we desperately need it. 
As we face down the COVID–19 crisis 
before us, I hope that these two pieces 
of legislation will serve as a model for 
how we can continue to work together, 
which is what I intend to do with our 
chairman. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
before my friend and colleague, Sen-
ator CARPER from Delaware, leaves the 
floor, I will tell you what a privilege it 
is to work with him, and we have 
worked together as partners on the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee. As you know, every chair 
works with a ranking member, and I 
couldn’t have a better partner than I 
have in TOM CARPER. He has been mag-
nificent in times, always trying to find 
a right solution that is a bipartisan so-
lution, and we have done it again today 
on the Environment and Public Works 
Committee as we passed two major 
pieces of water infrastructure legisla-
tion. 
Last year, we passed highway legisla-
tion, and he is focused, as am I, on re-
building for America the highways, the 
bridges, repairing as well the tunnels, 
all of the areas—roads, bridges, ports, 
riverways, reservoirs. I could not find a 
better partner. 
You know, it is interesting he men-
tioned Matthew 25, and if you read 
Matthew 25, it was Ben Franklin’s fa-
vorite Bible verse. What Ben Franklin 
would say is, if someone chose to live 
their life by one Bible verse, if they 
chose Matthew 25, he said, the world 
would be a better place. TOM CARPER is 
one who leads his life every day con-
sistent with the teaching and the read-
ings and the writings of the Gospel of 
Matthew 25. 
He mentioned my good friend Rob 
Wallace from Wyoming, who is now the 
Assistant Secretary of the Interior 
overseeing parks, as well as fish and 
wildlife for the country. Rob always 
said, as was so quoted by our Ranking 
Member CARPER, that bipartisan solu-
tions are the best solutions. He is 
somebody who knows. He worked on 
the Hill. He worked as a staffer for 
former Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wy-
oming and then on the Energy Com-
mittee when Senator Wallop was so ac-
tively involved in those days in the 
1980s and ’90s. 
But the other thing that Rob Wallace 
talked about, to which Senator CARPER 
and I agree as well, is there are lands 
in this great country that need to be 
protected and preserved and passed on 
because, as Rob pointed out that day, 
he said whether it was John Muir, who 
carried a stick, whether it was Ansel 
Adams, who carried a camera, or Teddy 
Roosevelt, who carried a gun all into 
these vast areas of our country, they 
all recognized, no matter what they 
were carrying, the value that these 
wonderful lands meant for the people of 
our country, and we needed to make 
sure that they were there for genera-
tions to come. 
I know that the work that Senator 
CARPER is doing on this committee is 
meant for generations to come, and it 
is a privilege to work with him.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come for an additional reason, and that 
is to tell you that in my home State of 
Wyoming, we have reopened. We did 
that starting last Friday. Many States 
across the country are continuing to do 
so, and people all across my home 
State are ready, willing, able, and 
needing to get back to work. We are 
doing it safely, we are doing it smartly, 
and we are following the guidelines set 
out by the White House. 
States all across the country are 
doing it. Governors and local leaders 
are reopening, and they are doing it in 
a responsible way. As of today, over 30 
States have reopened. On Thursday, 
Michigan will reopen. On Friday, Penn-
sylvania, North Carolina, as well as 
California will begin to reopen. By this 
time next week, nearly 40 States will 
have opened again. 
Now, we do hear, on the other side of 
the 
aisle, 
Democrats 
complaining 
about 
wanting 
to 
do 
significant 
amounts of additional spending. Ameri-
cans are busy getting back to work. 
That is where our focus should be. Peo-
ple are packing their lunches. They are 
taking proper precautions. They are 
putting on their work gloves. They are 
earning their keep. They aren’t looking 
for favors. They are not looking for 
frills from Washington. They just want 
to do their jobs, and they want to 
make sure that we do ours as well. 
We have spent close to $3 trillion in 
this country over the last 2 months, 
and we have a duty to make sure that 
money is spent properly and that we 
got it right. We need to make sure we 
are here and focused on work-friendly 
policies, and this doesn’t necessarily 
mean additional spending. It means 
making it easier for the 30 million peo-
ple who currently are out of work and 
who have lost their jobs to get back to 
work sooner. 
Our priorities are America’s prior-
ities: rebuilding the economy and jobs, 
addressing the coronavirus, and help-
ing our health systems. Plenty of dol-
lars have started to go out the door. 
Many more dollars, already approved, 
are still slated to go to the American 
people, to small businesses, to States, 
and to our healthcare system. The $3 
trillion doesn’t get spent overnight. 
The support we have provided is find-
ing its way through the economy, 
through the healthcare systems, and 
through the States to the men and 
women of America. States are looking 
at the dollars coming in, and they are 
figuring out how best to use the re-
sources. They are asking for more 
flexibility, and I believe they need to 
have more flexibility in how the money 
is spent. 
Senators and committees are here to 
make sure that we get this right. We

May 6, 2020 
need to do that through hearings, 
through oversight, and through con-
firmations. Just this week, the Senate 
will be having COVID–19-related hear-
ings in the Banking Committee, in the 
Homeland Security Committee, in the 
Commerce 
Committee, 
and 
in 
the 
Health and Education Committee. We 
are just getting started. 
Importantly, this is not the time to 
reshape America along some liberal 
wish list of ideas that the Democrats 
have suggested. It is not time to legis-
late from either Brooklyn or San Fran-
cisco. It is not time to veer to the left. 
It is time to stay focused. The Senate 
Republicans are here, and we are going 
to stay focused on the future of Amer-
ica. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
so agree with the comments that the 
Senator from Wyoming was just mak-
ing, and I hear them repeated every 
day in Tennessee by my constituents. 
I thank my colleagues who have 
asked me this week how Tennessee is 
doing. You know, we had another ter-
rible storm. It was our third this year. 
We have had two tornadoes, and we had 
lots of power outages and damaged 
trees that were down in Middle Ten-
nessee. The tornadoes, the storms on 
Sunday evening, and COVID are a lot 
for anybody to handle, but I think the 
Senator’s point is so well taken. 
Wyoming and Tennessee—these are 
States that are saying: We can do this. 
We are going to use the resources that 
are there for us because, yes, we want 
to get back to work, and we want to 
get back to normal. 
What is normal is a question and the 
right question for people to be asking 
because what is it going to look like 
and how is that daily routine going to 
be reshaped? How do we give up these 
worries that we have about health and 
wellness and safety and protection for 
ourselves and our families, our employ-
ers, our employees, and healthcare 
workers? All of this goes into the shape 
of a new routine for the day—the 
things you worry about, the things you 
are focused on, about your jobs, about 
businesses, about the future. 
Another point that comes up regu-
larly from Tennesseans was well made 
by a Wall Street Journal article that 
ran on Monday, and it was discussing 
that the U.S. Government would bor-
row $41⁄2 trillion this year for this fiscal 
year. Now, that is something that I 
think legitimately could be added to 
the worry list for those of us who are 
fiscal conservatives, and we are look-
ing at $25 trillion in debt. We are look-
ing at this debt load and thinking 
about that in relation to our GDP and 
thinking about the importance of fed-
eralism. We are very concerned about 
this. We are going to have—CBO says 
our annual deficit is going to be the 
highest it has been since World War II. 
When we think about that, we have 
to think about the fact that the 
‘‘greatest generation’’ looked at that, 
and they said: Let’s get in behind this, 
and let’s get that debt down. They were 
good about that. I think about the par-
ents and relatives and grandparents, 
and what did they say? If there is a 
task to be done, let’s go do it. That is 
why they lined up and they fought in 
World War II, and they reshaped the 
way our communities worked. They 
planted victory gardens. They changed 
their daily routines, and they went to 
work. They said: Let’s get in here, and 
let’s get this job done. They then put 
their focus on economic growth when 
they came out of the war, and look at 
what they accomplished. 
So while we think about the economy 
shrinking and jobless numbers growing 
and our vulnerable citizens, we have to 
think about the high price that is 
being paid there. We also have to think 
about what it does to our children and 
our grandchildren because our fore-
bears certainly thought about that for 
us, and our children and grandchildren 
deserve no less. 
When I am talking with Tennesseans 
who are stuck at home, and they are 
watching the news every night and 
they are listening to what we are say-
ing—they are in on Zoom meetings, 
and we are communicating with them 
daily—they have a tendency to say: 
How did we get here with a situation 
that is this bad that occurred this 
quickly? Should we not have seen this 
coming? 
In February, we had some of the best 
numbers we have ever had economi-
cally, and now you look at what has 
happened in this short transition. And 
what they will ask is, what kind of 
breakdown took place in our inter-
national order that could have allowed 
COVID–19 to spread beyond China’s 
borders and into our neighborhoods and 
our communities? 
I have to tell you, they are upset 
about this. They are angry that lives 
have been disrupted. 
I had a call from a lady who has high 
school children, and she said: You 
know, Marsha, I have to tell you, I 
went to the grocery store, and I looked 
at where every product was made be-
fore I put it in my cart. 
The reason she is checking where 
products are made—she said: I am so 
angry with China. I am angry with the 
lies, the deceit, and the lack of infor-
mation. I am angry that lives have 
been lost and livelihoods have been 
lost, and I am angry that my children 
have missed class days, field days, 
school sports, graduation, prom, sum-
mer camp, and summer jobs. It is a sea-
son of their lives that they are not 
going to recover. It is a loss of life and 
livelihood. 
The order that we had is the reason 
that Tennesseans are turning to us and 
they are saying: We expect you to in-
vestigate what happened, to review it, 
to oversee it, and to make certain that 
our preparation is better and that more 
forethought is given to how we are 
going to address this—addressing all of 
these Federal agencies and making cer-
tain that the bureaucracy doesn’t get 
in the way of the decisionmaking. 
At this point, we do know that there 
are a lot of unknowns, but what we do 
know is this: The Chinese Govern-
ment—the Chinese Communist Party— 
the Chinese Government spent the 
early days of the COVID–19 outbreak 
destroying testing samples, intimi-
dating doctors, expelling journalists, 
hiding information, and lying to the 
world. You know, it is so interesting 
that they still have not let the sci-
entists from the CDC into that Wuhan 
virology lab. They still don’t want any-
body in there. They lied to everybody 
about how dangerous this was, and 
they did that on purpose. Think about 
it—an intentional act of deception, re-
peated acts by the Chinese Communist 
Party to hide something that was an 
outbreak and try to keep it from the 
world. 
This seems inconceivable, that a per-
manent member of the U.N. Security 
Council and a former and likely future 
member of the Human Rights Council 
would be so careless with the lives and 
livelihoods of billions of people, but 
they did it. If you consider their track 
record, it does start to make sense be-
cause China is not a new problem; it is 
just a newly recognized problem. 
I fear America has forgotten the les-
sons we learned as we watched the 
Communist 
dogma 
burn 
its 
way 
through Eastern Europe, Russia, and 
Asia, twisting the minds of ambitious 
men who leveraged political mass mur-
der as a messaging tool, killing tens of 
millions of innocent people in the proc-
ess. 
During the Cold War, the divide be-
tween the Soviet bloc and the West was 
pretty clear. We could see that align-
ment with the Soviets would derail our 
global fight for democracy. We also 
caught glimpses of Mao’s China, where 
upwards of 30 million people died of 
starvation and disease directly at the 
hands of party officials—not an appre-
ciation for the sanctity of life—one of 
our first principles and tenets. 
Today, the Chinese Communist Party 
is still following that Soviet playbook, 
and it is time for the world to remem-
ber what that means before time runs 
out. Although Xi Jinping and the CCP 
have modernized their methods—they 
are all about cyber, and they are all 
about technology—here is what we 
have to remember: Their philosophy 
and their goals are exactly the same. 
They want to dominate the world mili-
tarily, economically, and politically. 
They are wanting domination, and 
they will step over and run over what-
ever gets in their way. 
What we have to do is to remember 
that China is capable of funneling mass 
amounts of cash, equipment, and phys-
ical support to developing countries. 
They are doing it all in exchange for 
loyalty to the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s agenda. For example, debt diplo-
macy 
schemes—that 
is 
their 
new 
thing—debt diplomacy schemes have

ensnared Sri Lanka and Djibouti and 
other countries in Africa and Asia. 
Those countries have in turn opened 
doors to strategically important ports 
and waterways and granted access to 
valuable natural resources. To be clear, 
these are not aid programs; they are 
tools of manipulation offered to na-
tions in desperate circumstances. 
For nations not in desperate cir-
cumstances, Beijing has to work a lit-
tle harder, but they still are working 
to get the job done. They count on the 
promise of cheap labor and production 
and low cost products to open doors 
with nations that normally are not 
going to work with somebody with 
such an abysmal human rights record 
as China has. 
The world is recalling some very hard 
lessons right now, but there is a path 
forward. We must secure our supply 
chains, and we must begin to return 
these critical infrastructure supply 
chains to the United States to make 
certain that we can bolster ourselves 
and that we are not completely depend-
ent on China for some items that are 
essential for us. 
The pharmaceutical supply chain is 
one on which I have focused, with Sen-
ator MENENDEZ, with our SAM-C legis-
lation. This week, Senator MCSALLY, 
Senator DAINES, and I introduced the 
Stop COVID Act to hold China legally 
liable for the damage caused by the 
spread of the novel coronavirus. Our 
colleagues have other pieces of legisla-
tion that have the same focused ac-
countability for China and making cer-
tain this doesn’t happen to us again. I 
encourage all of my colleagues to look 
at those. 
I also encourage my colleagues to ac-
cept that our relationship with China 
is broken right now and that it was 
never that great to begin with. But 
right now, it is broken. It is time for us 
to realize that we have to treat China 
as an adversary and we have to protect 
ourselves as we move forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, my 
first priority during the COVID–19 pan-
demic has been to do all I can to keep 
Georgians and all Americans safe and 
healthy. But while at home in Georgia 
these last few weeks, I have seen that 
the measures we needed to take to 
fight this unprecedented health crisis 
have created dramatic economic and 
societal impacts. 
One in five Georgians is unemployed. 
In the last 6 weeks, the Georgia De-
partment of Labor has issued more un-
employment payments than in the pre-
vious 4 years combined. 
Hotels in the Golden Isles were see-
ing 80 to 90 percent occupancy rates at 
the beginning of March, the start of 
beach season for our beach commu-
nities. As the number of tourists plum-
meted, the president of our visitors’ 
center described the economic impact 
as ‘‘absolutely devastating.’’ 
School districts, like Forsyth County 
schools, are organizing meal pickups 
and food delivery for students who 
typically rely on eating breakfast and 
lunch at school. 
Then there is the emotional toll com-
bating the virus has taken. A local law 
enforcement officer told me that his 
department has seen a dramatic spike 
in domestic abuse calls. An emergency 
hotline run by the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration saw a 1000-percent increase in 
calls last month compared to last 
April. 
The full cost of this pandemic re-
mains to be seen, but it is clear we 
need to look ahead and plan for a fu-
ture that protects Americans’ lives and 
livelihoods. 
As a member of the President’s Open-
ing Up America Again Congressional 
Group, I am putting to work my nearly 
three decades of experience building 
companies and creating jobs. 
Over the last few weeks, I have held 
more than 100 calls to hear directly 
from Georgia hospitals, State officials, 
first responders, food banks, small 
businesses, farmers, large employers, 
nonprofits, chambers of commerce, as 
well as the President and his adminis-
tration, to address the needs of Geor-
gians. 
With my experience and the feedback 
I have heard from Georgians, I have de-
veloped the USA Restoring & Igniting 
the Strength of our Economy Plan— 
USA RISE. This is a plan to bring back 
our thriving economy. It offers a four- 
pillared framework for investing in 
America, growing jobs, and helping 
families without expanding the grip of 
the Federal Government. It builds on 
the 
success 
of 
President 
Trump’s 
America First agenda. 
The USA RISE Plan calls on all of us 
in Congress to ensure that the more 
than $2 trillion of relief already passed 
in the CARES Act and in phase 3.5 is 
targeted to the areas of the economy 
that need it most while providing pru-
dent oversight. 
The first pillar, Made in the USA, ad-
dresses the fact that for too long, our 
manufacturing has moved overseas. 
Now more than ever, we are reminded 
of how dangerous it is to rely on other 
countries, especially competitors like 
China. 
The 
USA 
RISE 
Plan 
calls 
for 
incentivizing companies to return to 
the United States, investing in infra-
structure to spur economic develop-
ment, and having a competitive tax 
and intellectual property framework to 
promote hiring and capital expendi-
tures. We need to ensure that America 
remains the best country in the world 
to do business. 
The second pillar, Grown in the USA, 
is aimed at supporting our farmers and 
helping Americans who are seeing 
empty grocery shelves or local food 
banks that are depleted. 
I grew up working in the fields as the 
fourth generation working on my fam-
ily’s farm, and I know firsthand the 
challenges that farmers face even in 
the best of times. Today, fruit and veg-
etable prices are down about 50 to 60 
percent, and cattle and pork producers 
have been affected by meat processing 
plant closures and limitations. At the 
same time, the Georgia Food Bank As-
sociation told me they have seen 
roughly a 40-percent increase in de-
mand for their services. We need to en-
sure that the relief in the CARES Act 
is making its way to our farmers and 
agriculture businesses. 
Any future trade deals with China 
must hold the Chinese Communist 
Party accountable for their role in 
spreading the coronavirus and should 
focus on shifting supply chains back to 
the United States. 
Farmers account for just 2 percent of 
America’s population, but 100 percent 
of us eat. It is time to harness our agri-
culture advantage to support our farm-
ers who put their businesses on the line 
every single day to feed Americans and 
the world. 
The third component of my plan, Hir-
ing in the USA, proposes removing reg-
ulatory barriers and cutting taxes to 
help small businesses keep employees 
on the payroll and to create jobs. Half 
of all Americans are employed by small 
businesses, and these are the small 
businesses that have been particularly 
hurt by COVID–19. 
Congress has already taken extensive 
action to provide loans and grants to 
small businesses like Globalus, a small 
trucking company in Fulton County, 
and Jan’s Family Daycare in Dalton. I 
recently talked to daycare owners Bill 
and Jan Whetstone, who received a 
PPP loan. This will allow them to keep 
their doors open and to serve working 
families. Our economy cannot recover 
without our small businesses. 
My plan also calls for reducing the 
temptation for trial lawyers to use 
COVID–19 lawsuits to drain profits 
from employers at the expense of pro-
ductive jobs. Local shops and res-
taurants are the lifeblood of our com-
munities, and there is more we can do 
to help them. 
Finally, we must support families in 
building strong futures. Right now, too 
many families have lost their incomes 
and are struggling to afford their rent 
and to put food on the table. 
The fourth component of my plan is 
‘‘Families in the USA.’’ It aims to pro-
vide targeted relief for families and for 
children. Among other things, it sup-
ports churches that are helping fami-
lies during this difficult time and other 
organizations, like YMCAs across our 
State, which are the largest providers 
of childcare in Georgia, and they are 
providing thousands of meals each day 
to families across our State. 
In the last several weeks, we have 
made great strides in expanding testing 
for COVID–19. This is a crucial tool for 
getting back to work. Over 7 million 
Americans had been testing through 
Monday. As President Trump noted, no 
one else, no other country in the world 
has even come close to this level of 
testing. This is something we are proud 
to build on. In fact, the President has

also announced the Testing Blueprint, 
which is a partnership to help States 
build out their testing capabilities. 
In my State of Georgia, Governor 
Kemp has partnered with our univer-
sities and private companies to expand 
testing capabilities, and that is now at 
record levels. Anyone who thinks they 
may have the virus can use an app de-
veloped 
by 
Augusta 
University 
to 
screen their symptoms and schedule a 
test at one of the 66 testing centers in 
our State. 
Testing is a key component to re-
starting our economy safely, but we 
must start to adapt to this new reality 
now. Before this pandemic hit, we saw 
job creation and opportunity that lift-
ed up all Americans. The four pillars I 
have outlined are critical to reigniting 
our economic engine. The USA Rise 
Plan offers solutions to grow our econ-
omy without unnecessarily growing 
the Federal Government or our defi-
cits. 
Americans want to get back to work 
and back to their lives but safely. 
While we continue to fight COVID–19 
on the health front, we also must look 
ahead and make plans to rebuild now. I 
am confident we will because I know 
that when Americans unite, we rise to 
meet any challenge. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, it is 
good to be back in session. After 6 
weeks away from this place, it is good 
that we are all together working on 
some very important things. 
In the past 6 weeks, since we haven’t 
been here in session working together, 
a lot has changed. America has been 
overtaken, really, not just by the 
coronavirus but by the economic dam-
age it has caused. 
More than 30 million Americans have 
now filed for unemployment, and most 
believe we are approaching the highest 
unemployment we have had in this 
country since the Great Depression. It 
is a concern and particularly troubling 
because, if you think about it, just a 
few months ago, back in February, we 
hit a 50-year low in terms of unemploy-
ment in this country. So we have gone 
from a strong and growing economy to 
one where many people are out of work 
and many businesses have been shut-
tered. Some of these businesses tell me 
they may have shuttered permanently. 
I hope not, but it has been a tough 
time. At the same time, churches and 
schools have been closed. 
Some States have begun to reopen 
their economies, which is fantastic, but 
a majority of Americans are still living 
by very strict social distancing guide-
lines. 
I hear constantly from Ohioans about 
how much this has upended their lives. 
Sometimes small business owners will 
tell me a heartbreaking story of how 
they spent 30 or 40 years building a 
business, and now they have seen it 
devastated. They are in a situation 
where they have no cash flow and can’t 
keep the business open. 
At the same time, a lot of Americans 
have been teleworking. They have still 
been working, but they haven’t been 
going to the office or going to the fac-
tory. They have been working from 
home and figuring it out. 
Just like everything else, here in the 
Senate, we have been affected by this 
pandemic. As I said, we have been shut 
down for 6 weeks. This started back in 
March. One of our colleagues actually 
came down with the virus, but it was 
really on the advice of health officials 
and public health experts that we de-
cided not to reconvene. It was probably 
the safe thing to do at the time. 
Again, it is good we are back now. We 
are back now with the recommendation 
of the attending physician and other 
top medical experts. We have been 
wearing our masks dutifully and when 
appropriate. We have been keeping our 
social distance. 
My desk is actually over there, but 
there was another Senator over there, 
so they put me here, which is good. We 
have been doing this successfully this 
week, and that is great because we 
need to be here representing the voice 
of the American people. 
However, I will tell you, during these 
6 weeks when we weren’t convening, 
there was a lot of work to be done too. 
Yet Congress was unable to do it. Why? 
Because, unlike probably the majority 
of the people whom I represent, we 
don’t telework. We work, yes. We were 
home working hard. But we weren’t in-
volved in debates here. We weren’t in-
volved in hearings. We weren’t involved 
in debates on the floor. We weren’t in-
volved in voting. 
During that time period of 6 weeks, 
by the way, over half a trillion was ap-
propriated. In other words, this body 
chose to spend over half a trillion dol-
lars—that used to be a lot of money— 
of taxpayers’ money without people 
being here to weigh in, to vote, to have 
amendments, or to have debate. And 
that legislation had to be done because 
it had to do with helping small busi-
nesses in particular but also healthcare 
providers around the country and get-
ting more testing, which was very im-
portant. But wouldn’t it have been 
good had Congress been able to weigh 
in? But we couldn’t. Why? We don’t 
have the ability to remotely vote, 
much less engage in debate or much 
less have hearings. 
I think we should be able to do that. 
I think we should be able to meet and 
discuss things even when we can’t 
physically be here in the Capitol. 
f 
REMOTE VOTING 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, a cou-
ple of months ago, I introduced legisla-
tion here on the floor of the Senate 
with my colleague DICK DURBIN from 
Illinois. He is on the other side of the 
aisle. In a bipartisan way, we said: 
Let’s let Congress vote remotely. Let’s 
use safe and secure means to do that. 
The technology is out there to do that. 
It has to be safe, but let’s let Congress 
weigh in and vote remotely when we 
can’t meet. 
These last 6 weeks are an example of 
that, but it is not just about this pan-
demic. I have actually been talking 
about this for 25 years because I believe 
it is important for Congress to be able 
to meet when there is any reason we 
can’t come together or shouldn’t come 
together. 
After 9/11, a lot of people were more 
focused on this because a terrorist 
act—particularly a bioterrorist act— 
could have the same effect, of course. 
There have been periods of time 
where Congress has not been able to 
meet here, and there have been other 
periods of time like during the Cold 
War, when there was actually a bunker 
set up in the hills of West Virginia 
somewhere for us to convene for fear 
that there could be a nuclear attack. 
So Congress has thought about this be-
fore, but Congress has never been able 
to put in place the ability for us to 
vote remotely, for us to have debate re-
motely, and for us to have hearings re-
motely. I think that is too bad because 
we are the voice of the people. We rep-
resent individual congressional dis-
tricts on the other side of the Capitol. 
We represent individual States here. 
The Constitution set it up so that we 
are out here listening to people we rep-
resent, and we come here to represent 
that voice. 
The executive branch has its own 
role, and it is a very important one, 
but it shouldn’t take over the legisla-
tive branch role because they are dif-
ferent, and the Founders intended it 
that way, to have this separation of 
powers. 
By the way, other countries have 
done this. The United Kingdom has 
begun to conduct its proceedings re-
motely. The EU has started to vote re-
motely—the European Union. There 
are several other countries that have 
come up with one way or another to 
work remotely—to telework, in es-
sence. 
By the way, about 14 States have also 
figured this out so that they can con-
vene meetings and so on, and some of 
them even vote remotely. So I think it 
is time to do it. 
Last 
week, 
the 
Permanent 
Sub-
committee on Investigations, which I 
chair, had the first remote hearing in 
the history of the Congress, and it 
worked really well. We had three wit-
nesses. We had several Members of the 
Senate participate. The witnesses were 
all around the country, so we didn’t 
have to call them here to Washington. 
We didn’t have to gather as a group 
and therefore risk one of us infecting 
another 
or 
exposing 
us 
to 
the 
coronavirus. 
The witnesses were testifying from 
their homes, from a living room in one 
case. One of the witnesses actually tes-
tified from the cab of a pickup truck 
because she was at her sister’s place

and didn’t want to do it in the house. 
So she got in the pickup truck with her 
laptop, and it worked great. It worked 
great. We were able to ask questions 
and get answers. It worked just like a 
regular hearing. I was appreciative 
that the Rules Committee allowed us 
to do that. 
By the way, the technology is, in a 
sense, off-the-shelf technology because 
it is their technology. They have it. We 
didn’t have to recreate the wheel. It 
worked last week. We used it. I think it 
can be a template for other hearings. 
By the way, I am pleased to say that 
today, I participated in two more re-
mote hearings. Even though we are 
here in session, we are having remote 
hearings because it is not wise for us to 
all gather together with the staff and 
with the Capitol Police and others. It 
is safer for us to do this remotely. By 
the way, both of these hearings went 
well. One was in the Finance Com-
mittee, and the other was in the Home-
land Security and Government Affairs 
Committee. 
By the way, our hearing last week 
was online. You can check it out at 
psi.gov. The two hearings today were 
both online, live-streamed today. This 
does not mean that you cut out the 
public. In fact, I would say it is just 
the opposite. 
During these last 6 weeks, we could 
have had hearings every week and kept 
the public informed as to what we were 
thinking and gotten more input from 
the public in an official way and in a 
way that was so transparent that ev-
erybody could have been engaged in it, 
if they wanted to, just like C–SPAN, 
except it is online. This is something 
we can now do, and I hope we will con-
tinue to do it. 
I hope we will be sure that, as we do 
this, we also take serious this idea of 
not just having hearings and not just 
having the ability to interact as Re-
publicans and Democrats but actually 
have the ability to vote remotely when 
we shouldn’t be here. Again, it needs to 
be safe, and I think we can do that. 
I am convinced that if we put our 
minds to it, the technology is not the 
problem; the problem is tradition. I am 
not against tradition. A lot of them 
make sense. But do you know what? 
Tradition around here has changed a 
lot over the years. There didn’t used to 
be a filibuster, as an example, which is 
how we live right now, to get 60 votes 
for everything. That is OK. I am not 
saying it is a bad tradition to have 
changed, but the point is that we 
change tradition here a lot, and it is 
time for us to look at this. 
It is time for us essentially to catch 
up. Most of the people I represent are 
doing this. To one extent or another, 
they are teleworking. Most people in 
America today are realizing that you 
can actually get a lot done online, re-
motely. 
Today, I talked to some healthcare 
professionals who were telling me 
about one of the rare silver linings in 
this dark cloud that has descended 
upon our country. It is the fact that 
telemedicine has been proved over the 
past couple of months to be pretty darn 
effective. In many cases, it has been 
used because people are concerned or 
afraid about coming to a hospital or 
going to their doctor, but they can get 
the advice through telemedicine. 
I talked to some educators today. In 
fact, I also talked to the Ohio Farm 
Bureau today. I talked to a mom who 
is at home with her kids during the day 
now because her kids are home from 
school 
because 
schools 
have 
been 
closed. We talked about how much she 
has been able to learn about tele-
learning and how there is an oppor-
tunity here to do more outside of the 
classroom. It is not that we shouldn’t 
get back to classrooms—I think we 
should. I think that is an opportunity 
for kids to interact, which is impor-
tant. But we are beginning to acknowl-
edge that we can also do more after 
school in terms of telelearning. So this 
is just another example of it. 
This is a change that I think must be 
made to prepare us for the realities of 
this 21st century, where these contin-
gencies come up. It is a pandemic 
today. It may be something else tomor-
row. 
By the way, the way our legislation 
works for voting is that it is tem-
porary. So I don’t think this should be 
the norm. I think it should be only in 
emergencies and only when the major-
ity leader and the Democratic leader— 
so in a bipartisan way—decide it is the 
appropriate thing to do, and then, 
under our legislation, every 30 days, 
Congress would have to vote—presum-
ably remotely—to reaffirm it. Other-
wise, it ends. 
So it would be temporary, it would be 
in emergencies only, and it would be up 
to Republicans and Democrats alike at 
the leadership level to decide it is time 
to try remote voting and to be sure 
that we, as the Members of the people’s 
House across the way and the Members 
of the world’s greatest deliberative 
body here in the Senate, as we are 
called, have the chance to represent 
the millions of people we are charged 
with representing by being their voice 
here on the Senate floor. 
I hope we can, along with the times, 
change here and begin to be more effec-
tive in representing those constituents. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
also here to talk today about the work 
that is being done to help my home 
State of Ohio to get through this 
coronavirus. It is a crisis in so many 
ways. It is a healthcare crisis, but it 
has also become an economic crisis and 
a family crisis. It is affecting every-
body in ways that are truly heart-
breaking for me to see in so many in-
stances. 
I have talked to people who have 
been unemployed for the first time in 
their lives and have never had access to 
the unemployment insurance office. 
They have been fortunate. And now 
they have to. 
I have talked to people who started a 
small business and took a big risk to 
do that. They have five or six employ-
ees—it is a family-owned business—and 
they have been through the thick and 
thin over the years, but this one has 
really knocked them out. They have no 
income coming because they are in one 
of these businesses that by government 
order were shut down and cannot con-
tinue to serve the customers. 
I have talked to hospitals in a rural 
area of our State that cannot continue 
to operate. They have about a week 
left of cash reserves. Luckily, they are 
going to get some of this funding that 
Congress just provided with regard to 
the phase 3.5, as we are calling it, legis-
lation of the CARES Act. But they are 
really hurting. They have had to lay 
off more than half of their hospital 
staff. They can’t do elective surgery. 
They can’t have the normal work they 
are used to because people aren’t com-
ing in to see the doctor. They aren’t 
coming into the emergency room. 
The good news is, in Ohio and other 
States around the country, we are 
starting to open up and doing so safely. 
We are doing more testing and that is 
all good. It has been a tough time. 
Like so many Americans, I have been 
on the phone a lot. I have been on the 
phone pretty much all day, every day, 
into the night. A lot of what I have 
been doing is talking to constituents 
and talking to stakeholders across the 
State and hearing their concerns and 
trying to explain what we are doing 
here in Washington, how it would af-
fect them and their families, and get-
ting their input as to what we should 
do, but also I have been working with 
the White House, and HHS, FEMA, the 
FDA, Treasury, SBA, the Bureau of 
Prisons, the U.S. Trade Representative, 
State of Ohio, and others on corona-re-
lated matters to be able to help Ohio 
companies and help Ohio individuals. 
We have had some success in that. I am 
proud of that. In terms of constituents, 
we held seven tele-townhall meetings 
in the last 6 weeks where we hear di-
rectly from people, thousands of Ohio-
ans. Again, there are a lot of heart-
breaking stories and also a lot of really 
inspiring stories about people who 
stepped up and helped. 
One guy lost his job and decided to go 
volunteer at a food pantry. He wears 
the PPE, the mask and the gloves, and 
he delivers food to people who have 
never had to worry about food security 
before because they always had a job. 
Now, they don’t have a job and are 
waiting to get their unemployment in-
surance, and they can’t put food on the 
table. Some of them feel funny about 
going to a food pantry because they 
have never done that before. He makes 
them feel more at home, he said, and 
understanding and more welcomed. 
I talked to people who are delivering 
groceries to their neighbors who are 
seniors and who are more vulnerable. 
God bless them. I talked to people who

are making homemade masks at home. 
I brought some with me on my trip to 
Washington. They are doing it as vol-
unteers, not asking for anything other 
than, if you take this mask, you have 
to agree you are also going to be help-
ing your neighbor. 
The frontline workers, the hospital 
workers, are putting their healthcare 
on the line for us. They are risking 
their own healthcare and the possi-
bility of getting this virus to help all of 
us and to help our grandparents and 
our parents. God bless them. 
I love when the healthcare workers 
are being held up by everybody. I think 
today is official Nurses Day. We should 
all be thanking our healthcare profes-
sionals and, specifically today, our 
nurses for what they do every day in 
every time period, but particularly 
during this crisis, where they have 
been working really long hours and 
doing everything they can to try to 
protect us. I appreciate the people who 
are doing everything else on the 
frontlines right now, whether working 
in a grocery store stacking shelves or 
whether you are driving a truck. I 
drove my pickup truck from Ohio to 
Washington on Sunday to be here for 
this week, and every time I went by a 
truck, I said thank you just for being 
out there and delivering the food and 
delivering the products. We thank 
those folks for what they are doing, all 
of them. 
One thing I tried to do is to help in 
terms of explaining what is going on in 
getting input. We talked to more than 
a dozen groups out there. I talked to 
the Farm Bureau today in Ohio, but I 
also talked to the hospitals, small busi-
ness owners, food banks, the non-
profits, and many others to hear how 
we can support them during this tough 
time. 
This afternoon, we had a telephone 
call with some of the largest businesses 
in Ohio, a group called the Ohio Busi-
ness Roundtable. They talked about 
some of the things they are doing to 
keep their employees safe because 
some of them are essential businesses. 
I encouraged them, as I always do, to 
get your best practices out to all your 
others business associates. Let them 
know how we can reopen safely. We are 
starting to open in Ohio. We want to 
know it is safe. The best advice will 
not be from a piece of paper—as impor-
tant as that guidance is from the White 
House or the State of Ohio—it is going 
to be from other businesses who found 
out things you can do, like stagger the 
lunch break. That helps to spread peo-
ple out. 
These things might not be obvious, 
such as do the temperature testing as 
people come in. Be sure that you are 
doing everything you can do to explain 
to people what they can do if they feel 
like they are getting sick, who they 
can go to and how they can be sure 
that they are not infecting others. I 
think there is an opportunity here to 
reopen and do it safely. 
One reason we are able to reopen in 
Ohio safely is we have a lot more test-
ing now. Like many States, we didn’t 
have enough testing until recently. 
Now, we are getting it. We had 3,700 
tests per day, 2 weeks ago. Within 2 or 
3 weeks from today, we will have 20,000 
tests per day, a 600 percent increase. 
We had to work at it because we were 
having trouble getting some of the 
components for testing, particularly 
the reagent. The State of Ohio, to its 
credit, with Governor DeWine, reached 
an agreement with Thermo Fisher, a 
private sector company taking the lead 
in providing us a guaranteed supply 
chain of this reagent under their tests, 
which enables us to dramatically re-
spond to increasing our testing. 
We are getting to a point where you 
can have a lot more drive-through test-
ing at Kroger and Walmart and some of 
our drug stores. We are starting to get 
the testing much easier for people be-
cause you can drive through. You don’t 
have to get out of your car, and you 
feel safer. 
The saliva test, as opposed to a test 
where they take a swab deep into your 
nasal cavities, is a lot less intrusive, 
and that is starting to be used more. 
We are beginning to have enough test-
ing where we can more safely say: 
Look, we are going to reopen, but we 
are going to test people a lot. If we find 
a problem, we are going to do the con-
tact tracing to figure out who that per-
son has been with and quarantine those 
people. That is less hard than quaran-
tining everybody else. 
For all of us, really, testing is where 
there is a problem. We will get to a 
point where we can test people who are 
asymptomatic. Even if you don’t have 
symptoms, you could be a carrier. I 
think dramatically increasing the test-
ing is the key thing. This is a diag-
nostic test. There are also the immu-
nity tests coming up, which is also 
helpful, but nothing replaces the diag-
nostic test which says whether you 
have it or don’t. 
We also have seen good news in Ohio 
and around the country on these 
antiviral medications. That is the rea-
son we can reopen safely, too. If some-
one does get coronavirus, they have a 
chance 
to 
take 
something 
like 
Tamiflu, which you take for the com-
mon flu. Remdesivir is the most recent 
one the FDA has approved, which has a 
record of being very helpful. People 
want to know, if they get the virus, 
that they can take something for it. 
That is helpful. 
Finally, we are getting our hands 
around the PPE issue, the personal 
protective equipment, the masks and 
gloves and the gowns. This evening, 
after this talk, I am going to be work-
ing with an Ohio company that is in-
terested in dramatically expanding the 
gown production. That would be great. 
We are working with the White House 
and others to try to ensure that can 
happen. 
We have a lot of great world-class 
businesses in Ohio. What I am talking 
about tonight is an example of that. 
There are others, too, in healthcare 
systems that have contributed to this 
coronavirus crisis all over the country. 
I have been working the last 6 weeks 
with them, making sure they have the 
opportunity to do that. 
One of those key contributions from 
Ohio has been from a company called 
Battelle. Battelle is a global research 
institution 
and 
happens 
to 
be 
headquartered in Columbus, OH. They 
do awesome work all over the world. 
They run some of our national labs for 
the Energy Department. We worked 
with the Trump administration and 
with Ohio Governor Mike DeWine to 
help them get approval for a really in-
novative technology where they can 
take an N95 mask—one like this, ex-
cept even better because it is N95—and 
they can recycle that mask. They de-
contaminate it. 
These masks can be recycled up to 20 
times. Think about that, 20 times. It is 
groundbreaking 
because 
they 
have 
enough machines to spread out around 
the country. They have 60 machines 
that they can recycle and decontami-
nate between 4 and 5 million masks a 
day. I worked with FEMA, HHS, and 
the White House to help Battelle se-
cure a contract with the Federal Gov-
ernment to be able to take their tech-
nology and machines and spread them 
initially to hot spots around the coun-
try like New York, Boston, Chicago, 
Detroit, and now other places. 
I would tell people who might be lis-
tening that, if you are connected with 
a healthcare entity, a hospital, a nurs-
ing home, EMS, if you are a firefighter 
and you use these N95 masks, don’t 
throw them away. When you are done 
with them, put them aside in a sepa-
rate bin for recycling and get them 
picked up. We worked on a contract 
with the Federal Government to help 
with the pick-up and delivery, which is 
also available now. You can get them 
picked up and take them to Battelle. 
Hopefully, they have a cleaning station 
near you, and for free, you get a recy-
cled mask back. The process takes 
about 8 hours. If you are close to one, 
you can get it overnight. 
We are not at full capacity on these 
machines. We should be. It is a great 
idea. Why spend the money to get some 
overpriced mask from China—because 
they are all overpriced now—when you 
can actually recycle what you have? It 
is a lot less medical waste, too. If you 
are 
interested 
in 
that, 
go 
to 
Battelle.org and learn more about it, 
or 
go 
to 
our 
website 
Portman.senate.gov, to find out more 
about it. Find out if there is a machine 
near you. Even if there is not, we can 
send them, and we can help you con-
nect with companies, including Car-
dinal Health in Ohio, providing some of 
the logistics to get the masks back and 
forth. 
That is an example of some of the 
things we have been working on the 
past 6 weeks to help with this effort. I 
want to, again, as I have done before, 
commend the folks at Battelle for de-
voting their time and energy to this

project. As soon as this coronavirus 
came up, they said to the engineers: 
Forget what you are doing, go work on 
this. They have also done a lot of test-
ing with Ohio State, putting their folks 
against that, and now, they are work-
ing on other interesting technology 
that could be very helpful in detecting 
coronavirus. It is an example. 
We had another company, Cardinal 
Health, that I mentioned, that are 
helping in terms of the logistics. They 
did something else early on. They came 
to me and said: We have 2.3 million 
protective gowns in storage. We are not 
using them. They are the kind of gowns 
that can be used as isolation gowns. 
They are very effective. They are not 
qualified as surgical gowns, but they 
can be used as isolation gowns. They 
were willing to donate them to the Na-
tional Stockpile. We worked with, 
again, FDA, HHS, and the White House 
to get through some of the red tape be-
cause it is tough to get things approved 
at times with the Federal Government. 
There are reasons for that. We want to 
be safe. We got approval for those 
gowns, and bingo, like that, they start-
ed to go out. They went to New York, 
they went to Detroit, they went to 
places where are there are hot spots. 
They are in the National Stockpile. 
They donated 2.3 million gowns. 
One company that has been very 
helpful to so many Americans is GoJo. 
It is a company that makes Purell. I 
see some up here on the desk. Purell is 
made in Ohio, outside of Akron. We are 
very proud of Purell. They have been 
going 24/7, producing all they can. It is 
tough to find it in the grocery store be-
cause, as soon as the shipment comes 
in, they take it and use it. It is par-
ticularly helpful now that they have 
Purell beginning to reopen. 
Reopening means doing things dif-
ferently. It means wearing a mask 
when you are in proximity with some-
body else. It means using Purell and 
washing your hands more often. It 
means being sure you are following the 
rules to be able to stay safe. Purell will 
continue to be needed. 
They had a problem because the Fed-
eral Government was assessing a 25- 
percent tariff on two critical items 
they had to have for the dispensers. At 
least one item had a patent in China. 
China had the patent on it. Things 
were coming in from China with a 25- 
percent tariff. We were able to go to a 
U.S. Trade Representative. I commend 
Bob Lighthizer, who is the Trade Rep, 
for working with us on this. 
For this period of time, they took 
that 25 percent off. They were having a 
tough time getting the supply and be-
cause it was increasing the costs by 25 
percent. We were able to do that. Now. 
They are able to produce more of this 
Purell and more dispensers and do it 
less expensively. 
By the way, this leads me to a com-
ment on China. We need to pull back 
some of what we make in China and 
make it here. It is a pretty simple con-
cept. It is harder to implement because 
our supply chains are global and they 
are complex. Who would have thought 
that, on a GoJo dispenser for Purell, 
there would be a Chinese patented 
product, but there is. Whether it is 
gowns,—most of which are made in 
China—or masks or other products like 
something essential that is in a hand 
sanitizer dispenser, we have to pull 
those products back. 
I think the way to do it isn’t to beat 
up on China, but rather to provide the 
incentive—the 
carrot—to 
American 
companies and other companies and 
say, Make it here, make it in America. 
I think we can do that as a group, Re-
publicans and Democrats alike. 
I think there is consensus now that 
we should do more to reshore, and in 
some cases, shore for the first time, 
products that have been moved over-
seas and particularly to China. We 
wouldn’t have had to get that special 
permission on the 25-percent tariff if it 
was made here. 
We also worked with the FDA to get 
approval for a company called Second 
Breath in Cleveland, OH. It is another 
great example. There are so many in 
Ohio, but this is a company that didn’t 
make ventilators at all. It is a consor-
tium of several manufacturing compa-
nies that work together. But again, 
early on in this crisis, they said: We 
need ventilators. We can do that. We 
are manufacturers. We are Ohioans. We 
are inventors. 
They went out and made these ven-
tilators on their own that were then 
tested at three different Ohio hospitals. 
The medical community loved them. 
They are relatively inexpensive, rel-
atively simple, and very effective. 
Again, the FDA had to go through its 
process. My job is not to say to the 
FDA, You need to approve this. My job 
was to ask them to please expedite this 
process so, if it can be approved, we can 
get this out to people who are literally 
dying and need the ventilators. To the 
FDA’s credit, Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, in 
particular, worked with us and got that 
product approved. 
They already made a bunch of them. 
They weren’t going to send them out if 
they didn’t get approval. They didn’t 
care because they were willing to take 
a loss, with the opportunity to save 
people. Now, those ventilators have 
gone out to stockpiles and hospitals, 
including New York, when they needed 
them all over the country. 
It is an example of the kinds of 
things over the last 6 weeks we have 
been able to do in Ohio. The result is 
companies in Ohio are now making 
swabs, making masks, making face 
shields, making hand sanitizer. 
Proctor and Gamble converted some 
of their perfume-making factory to 
making hand sanitizer. It probably 
smells pretty good. I don’t know if it 
actually has a particular odor to it. If 
it comes from a perfume factory, it 
might not just be effective, but smell 
pretty good, too. Thanks to Proctor 
and Gamble and all these companies 
that are willing to step up and do these 
things they have never done before and 
respond to these crisis—that is what 
Americans do. We get knocked down; 
we figure it out. We get back on our 
feet. 
Ultimately, I am optimistic. Think 
about what has happened in the last 
couple of weeks. There is substantially 
new testing. In my own State of Ohio, 
again, a 600-percent increase of tests 
from 2 weeks to 3 weeks from now. In-
creasingly, new antiviral medication 
has been approved. It is something peo-
ple can rely on—more testing and 
antiviral medication is critical. There 
are more PPEs. Finally, we are fig-
uring it out, like the recycling which 
we can do right here in America. We 
can recycle our own masks. There are 
the gowns we are trying to get pro-
duced more here in America right now. 
We are starting to catch up on things 
that, frankly, we were pretty far be-
hind in. 
On the testing, I will tell you that, 
for the first few weeks of this crisis, 
you couldn’t get a test in most parts of 
Ohio unless you were so severely ill 
that you had to be hospitalized. That 
was wrong. We just weren’t prepared as 
a country. 
By the way, the last administration 
wouldn’t have been any more prepared, 
nor would the previous administration, 
which I served, have been any more 
prepared. We were not expecting a pan-
demic like this. We should have been, 
of course. There were some warnings. 
The country now will be prepared. 
One thing we are doing is we are add-
ing to that stockpile with the PPE, 
with the ventilators, and obviously 
with the antiviral medications for this 
virus and the vaccine for this virus. My 
hope is that vaccine, which the admin-
istration 
calls 
their 
process 
warp 
speed—and I appreciate that they are 
working around the clock. There are 
some scientists who have devoted their 
lives to this now. That is all they are 
doing. 
And God bless them, and there are a 
bunch of them. And, by the way, some 
of these vaccines will not work. People 
will have spent hundreds of millions of 
dollars—even billions of dollars—on 
stuff that is not going to work. But 
kind of like those ventilators were 
made even though they didn’t know if 
they were going to get approval or not, 
we want to have that virus vaccine 
ready. 
If it does work and it gets approval, 
we want to have lots of doses of it al-
ready made. So there is going to be 
some money spent, including by the 
Federal taxpayer, but that is OK to en-
sure that we end up with something 
that really can be effective. 
On the testing, I will tell you that in 
my own hometown of Cincinnati, OH, 
those first few weeks we really couldn’t 
get tested unless you were to be hos-
pitalized. And we had an interesting 
issue there, again, showing how Wash-
ington sometimes can make things a 
little slower. The University of Cin-
cinnati, which is our primary academic

medical center in southern Ohio, had 
ordered a testing machine back in Feb-
ruary. They ordered it because they 
knew this was coming, and they want-
ed to get the best of the best. So it was 
a high-quality machine, with high ac-
curacy, and it could do 1,000 tests a 
day. By the way, at the time, they were 
doing about 80 to 100 tests a day in 
their own little lab, but they needed 
this equipment, and they had a con-
tract for it back in February. 
Well, come March they kept hearing 
next week, next week, next week, and 
they called me and I got involved. I got 
to the company and got to the Univer-
sity of Cincinnati and said: What is the 
real problem here? And they said: Well, 
we are being told by the Federal Gov-
ernment that we can’t deliver it to Cin-
cinnati. It needs to go somewhere else. 
I said: Well, they contracted for this 
back in February, and we are desperate 
for testing. We may not be a hotspot 
right now, but we are going to be un-
less we get some testing. 
So, again, we broke through the red-
tape and broke through what was some 
miscommunication. It turned out, with 
the help of the White House, that we 
got the approval to get the diagnostic 
tests there that had already been con-
tracted for. It is called a cobas 6800 ma-
chine. It can process more than 1,000 
diagnostic tests per day, and it is 
working. It is every day giving more 
people the sense of security that they 
know whether they have this or not, 
and they know whether the person that 
works in the store has it or not, and 
they know that we have more access to 
testing. 
Now, I am not saying we are getting 
there, but that would be key to getting 
us back to business but also reopening 
in a way that we don’t have to stop if 
there is an outbreak because we will 
have the testing to be able to really 
throw at it and then the contact trac-
ing and be able to ensure that we can 
stop the spread of the virus. 
So those are some of the things that 
we have worked on. We have worked 
with FEMA to unlock additional re-
sources for Ohio, and that has hap-
pened around the country. 
USDA has now allowed the Ohio De-
partment of Job and Family Services 
to operate the Disaster Household Dis-
tribution 
Program. 
We 
appreciate 
them. We worked with them on that so 
that we can officially get meals to food 
banks and families in Ohio. 
We worked with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to ensure that vet-
erans could get an extension on their 
filing of claims and appeals during this 
time period for veterans’ compensation 
benefits and other benefits during a 
time when the VA offices have been 
closed. 
We helped stop the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons from sending more prisoners to 
one of our hotspots. It is a really sad 
case, the Elkton Federal prison in 
Ohio. We also helped them bring more 
healthcare 
to 
the 
Elkton 
prison. 
Frankly, I am discouraged that they 
aren’t doing more testing there. I talk 
to them constantly, and they are pro-
viding more testing, but not enough— 
not enough. I think it is inexcusable. 
I think, in a situation like a nursing 
home or a prison, we should be focused 
on getting the testing in there. These 
are what they call congregant living 
situations. In this case it is a low-secu-
rity prison. So it is more like dor-
mitory-type style living, and, unfortu-
nately, if they were to test as much as 
they should, I believe they would find 
out, as we found out in other State 
prisons in Ohio, that more than half 
the prisoners there are carrying the 
virus, and you have got to separate 
those people out from those who don’t 
have it and do much more treating and 
tracing. But we have made progress 
there, and we will continue to. 
The phase 3.5 rescue package we 
passed a few weeks ago does have fund-
ing for the PPP program, which is for 
small businesses, to be able to keep 
their employees and keep their doors 
open. 
It 
also 
has 
funding 
for 
healthcare. But the piece that hasn’t 
gotten much attention and may be the 
most important aspect of the bill of all 
is $25 billion in the bill for more test-
ing. 
Again, I am a broken record here on 
testing, but that money is so impor-
tant, and we are using it in Ohio right 
now. About $43 million has come to 
Ohio recently, I am told, and that fund-
ing will be helpful not just to ensure 
that we have testing, but do we have 
enough testing so that we will get a 
sense of what is going on in terms of 
the healthcare crisis, and then, when 
there is a hotspot, address it again im-
mediately and be able to stop the 
spread of the virus? It is so important 
to us reopening and getting people 
back to work, back to their churches 
and other places of worship, and back 
to school. 
We need to get back to a normal life, 
and we can, and we will. We will figure 
this out, but we do need the help of 
having the necessary testing capacity, 
diagnostic testing, and then it is also 
helpful to have the antibody test so 
you know whether you have developed 
an immunity or not. But those are both 
needed. You can’t do it just with the 
antibody test. You have to also know 
through the diagnostic test whether 
someone has the disease or not to be 
able to pull that person out of a situa-
tion where he or she is with others and 
to find out whom they have been in 
touch with and do the contact tracing, 
and, again, quarantining those people, 
not quarantining everybody else. That 
is the effective way to do it. 
Congress has now passed four of these 
legislative 
measures 
in 
an 
over-
whelming, bipartisan fashion. It is a 
lot of money. About $3 trillion have 
gone out the door from Federal tax-
payers. I hope we can continue to be bi-
partisan. I hope we can work together 
to figure out how to move forward. 
In my view, moving forward means 
looking at what we have done care-
fully. Let’s not start to legislate again 
and spend more money until we know 
how what we have already sent works. 
The money is just being distributed 
now. In fact, most of our money in 
Ohio that goes to the State and local 
governments has not been distributed 
yet. Let’s get that money out. 
By the way, they need it. They need 
it badly. They need it to pay police and 
fire and EMS. Our cities in Ohio are 
really hurting because they depend so 
much on income taxes, on earnings 
taxes. Other cities in America don’t be-
cause they can’t, but about four of the 
top five cities in America that were 
most affected by the reduction in rev-
enue from the coronavirus are in 
Ohio—Columbus, 
Cleveland, 
Cin-
cinnati, and Toledo. 
So they have a real problem on their 
hands. I strongly urge the Department 
of Treasury to loosen up their require-
ments to allow that State and local 
funding to be used more flexibly, spe-
cifically for payroll, for public safety. 
Based on Monday’s guidance that we 
just got a couple of days ago here, they 
can now do that. That is just guidance. 
It is not legislation. I would love in 
whatever we do going forward to get 
that in legislation, to say: Let’s pro-
vide flexibility to the States but also 
to these municipalities. 
I will tell you that in my home State 
of Ohio, again, at the municipal level, 
we are really hurting. Budgets are 
being slashed because the revenue is 
not coming in because it is based on 
the economy. Most cities rely heavily 
on property tax. We don’t. Property 
tax has not been affected in the way 
that income tax has or sales tax. 
So we do need to pay attention to 
this, and people say: Well, we shouldn’t 
send in more money to municipalities. 
Let’s start with flexibility. Let them 
use the money they have more effec-
tively for what they actually need. 
I don’t want a situation where you 
have a 30-percent or 40-percent cut in 
police, which is what is happening in 
some of our municipalities, to affect 
the public safety of our communities at 
a time like this. Police officers need to 
be on the street doing their jobs. God 
bless them. They are out there. We 
need them. 
As for EMS personnel, if your grand-
mother needs to be rushed to the hos-
pital, you want the EMS to come. You 
don’t want to have a 40-percent cut in 
their services. So we do have to deal 
with this issue and be sure to provide 
flexibility is the first step. 
And let’s codify that by statute and 
make sure it is clear, not just guidance 
that doesn’t seem to be consistent with 
the underlying law, because the under-
lying law says it has to be directly re-
lated to the COVID–19, and some of this 
is not. You need police officers on the 
street whether you had COVID–19 or 
not. So let’s be sure we codify that and 
then let’s see what is needed. 
But I also think that in this next leg-
islation we also have to be sure that we 
are not just looking at what has al-
ready passed but looking ahead. And

looking ahead means the ability to re-
open, and that means stimulating the 
economy and creating—whether it is 
tax relief or whether it is smart invest-
ment in infrastructure. Let’s say the 
projects that are already on the books 
in my State and yours, projects that 
are already shovel-ready because they 
are ready to go, they have gone 
through the merit-based process in our 
States, but many of those projects will 
not be able to be funded this year by 
our States. Why? Because their reve-
nues have collapsed, particularly their 
gas taxes have collapsed. So the State 
match, which is based on the amount 
of gas you buy, has gone down because 
people aren’t driving nearly as much. 
What if we picked up some of that at 
the Federal level? These are good 
projects because they aren’t bridges to 
nowhere. They have been through the 
merit-based 
process, 
and 
they 
are 
ready to go. That is an idea. Why? It is 
good jobs, one, which are needed right 
now, and good benefits, but also it is 
economic benefit. Those dollars will 
come back in terms of improved roads 
and bridges and ports and airports. 
Rural broadband would really help 
right now. As people are telelearning 
and teleworking more and more, they 
are finding out: Oh, my gosh, there are 
big parts of our country that don’t 
have broadband access, can’t get Wi-Fi, 
and if you can, it is way too slow. 
Again, talking to the Farm Bureau 
today, you would think they would be 
talking about the price of corn and 
soybeans, and they were, and the huge 
issues we have right now in the beef in-
dustry and the pork industry and poul-
try, but they were also talking about: I 
got my kids at home and we can’t do 
the homework because we can’t get 
broadband in a lot of parts of Ohio— 
probably in about a third of our State. 
Ohio is not viewed as a State that has 
huge, sparsely populated rural areas, 
but we have enough, and we have a real 
lack of access to broadband to be able 
even to do schoolwork, much less to 
start a small business. 
So this is another area where we can 
provide some help for that here, and it 
would come back in terms of increased 
dollars from having more economic de-
velopment in some of these rural areas. 
So I think there are some things we 
need to do there as well. 
There has been a lot of discussion 
about this issue of liability protection. 
Let me tell you my perspective on this. 
It is very simple. This should not be a 
partisan issue. I mean, we should not 
want these hospitals and these schools 
and these small businesses and any-
body to be able to be sued for some-
thing that was totally out of their con-
trol. This is not something anybody 
should be blamed for, certainly in this 
country. We know where it started, in 
Hubei Province, in Wuhan, China. But 
as for the fact that this has come over 
here and people are affected by it, let’s 
not have a trial lawyer bonanza here 
because that will result in people not 
getting back to work. It will result in 
more costs for our universities. 
I understand some of them are being 
sued right now because they have stu-
dents who are telelearning. Well, yes, 
it is not their fault. You can’t bring 
students together right now in the dor-
mitories. It is not safe. 
I know there is, again, kind of a par-
tisan nature to this. It shouldn’t be 
partisan at all. We should all want peo-
ple to go back to work, to be able to go 
back to school, to be able to access the 
healthcare system. 
I also think that for my colleagues 
on my side of the aisle who might want 
to 
make 
this 
broader 
than 
the 
coronavirus, 
let’s 
keep 
it 
to 
the 
coronavirus, and I think that is what 
people intend. Let’s keep it to COVID– 
19, and let’s provide the kind of protec-
tions—sensible protections—that are 
necessary to be able to allow people to 
get back to a normal life. 
People say: Well, things are going to 
be so different now in America. They 
will be different. We will be more cau-
tious. You know, we will probably, 
therefore, have a less drastic flu season 
too because we will be more careful. 
With this pandemic, you know, we 
don’t know if it is going to come back 
again like it did a couple of months 
ago. Will it come back again in the fall 
or the winter like that, but we have to 
be prepared for that. So life will not be 
exactly the same. There is no question 
about it. There will be some things 
that will be different, too. There will 
be more teleworking because it is has 
worked well. It is cost effective, and it 
is efficient. There will be more tele-
medicine because it has worked well. 
I have talked to a number of doctors 
who were actually very pleased with 
some of the things they have been able 
to do remotely. I hope we will have a 
Congress that works more remotely so 
when we are on our recesses, as we do 
every August, and as we do periodi-
cally, that we could have remote hear-
ings on a more regular basis because it 
is great information. 
But, ultimately, I think our country 
will get back on track. Again, we, as 
Americans, when we get knocked down, 
we get back up on our feet, and that is 
what we will do. And we will have 
again not just the greatest economy on 
the face of the Earth, but we again will 
be that beacon of hope and opportuni-
ties for the rest of the world. People 
will again look at America and say: I 
want to be like that. And we will be 
able to show that and how we get back 
on our feet and how we get back to a 
more normal life, and, once again, the 
greatest country on the face of this 
Earth will be able to once again be able 
to show the world an ideal for everyone 
to aspire to.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF FIRSTLINK 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want 
to recognize the 50th anniversary this 
month of FirstLink, a vital North Da-
kota organization which provides free 
and confidential mental health, suicide 
prevention, and other services 24 hours 
a day, 7 days a week. 
FirstLink offers listening and sup-
port, resource referrals and crisis inter-
vention. Across the entire State of 
North Dakota and parts of Minnesota, 
FirstLink answers calls for 17 agencies, 
notably the 211 helpline and the Na-
tional 
Suicide 
Prevention 
Lifeline. 
Those reaching out for help now have 
the ability to also communicate by 
text messaging at 898–211. 
Last year, FirstLink answered 60,148 
calls. Of those, 13,446 were related to 
suicide. Its Caring Contacts service re-
ceives referrals from hospitals and 
clinics across North Dakota in addition 
to the phone calls that come in. Caring 
Contacts offers informal resources and 
coping strategies, encourages mental 
health 
treatment, 
and 
provides 
nonjudgmental listening and support. 
These calls are offered around the 
schedules of the individuals in need. 
Additional training is also offered to 
staff and volunteers from other State 
organizations working with people of 
all ages. 
FirstLink began as a grassroots vol-
unteer organization in the Fargo area, 
first taking calls 6 hours a day. It has 
grown in hours and scope, thanks to 
private and public support, a staff of 20, 
a 12-member board, and many volun-
teers. 
The profound impact of the work 
FirstLink has done over these past 50 
years can never be adequately meas-
ured. On behalf of all North Dakotans, 
I congratulate and sincerely thank ex-
ecutive director Cindy Miller and all 
staff and volunteers for the difference 
their commitment has made to the 
quality of life in our State. May your 
next 50 years be just as meaningful.∑

TRIBUTE TO THE SALEM HIGH 
SCHOOL CHEERLEADING TEAM 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize Salem High School’s 
cheerleading team as April’s Granite 
Staters of the Month for coming to-
gether, even while social distancing, to 
help raise the spirits of residents at a 
local nursing home. 
Due to the COVID–19 pandemic, Sa-
lem’s cheerleading team was unable to 
compete at their New England con-
ference meet, a moment that the ath-
letes had worked hard for all season. In 
an effort to cheer up her teammates, as 
well as bring joy to residents at their 
local nursing home, Gabrielle Driggers, 
a sophomore on the team, suggested 
throwing a parade for the residents, 
which 
included 
Gabrielle’s 
grand-
mother. 
Gabrielle, who has led previous ef-
forts to support her local community 
by organizing donation drives and 
fundraisers with the help of her team-
mates, texted the team’s group chat to 
see if anyone would be willing to par-
ticipate in a parade for residents at

Salemhaven Skilled Nursing and Reha-
bilitation Center. A few days later, be-
tween 
25 
to 
30 
members 
of 
the 
cheerleading team gathered in the 
Salem High School parking lot, pom- 
poms in hand, to greet their fellow 
teammates from the safety of their 
cars and prepare for the procession to 
the nursing home. 
The parade, which was carefully 
planned to ensure that all of the ath-
letes were at least 6 feet away from one 
another and the residents, consisted of 
a line of cars where cheerleaders, one 
to a car, waved their pom-poms and 
blasted music to the delight of the resi-
dents. 
I commend the members of the 
Salem High School cheerleading team 
for recognizing the importance of en-
suring that those who are the most vul-
nerable to the virus feel supported and 
seen during this public health emer-
gency. This is a difficult time for all 
Americans, which is why this straight-
forward act of kindness and recogni-
tion of community resonates with 
Granite Staters and all Americans and 
reflects the very best of our State.∑

TRIBUTE TO DARREL ANDERSON 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor an outstanding business 
leader from the great State of Idaho— 
Idaho Power CEO Darrel Anderson. 
There are many ways to define an ef-
fective leader: by their vision, their 
passion, or their courage to do some-
thing bold. Mr. Anderson possesses all 
the necessary qualifications and more. 
His impeccable character, his authen-
ticity, and his humility define his suc-
cess not only as CEO but also as an up-
standing Idaho citizen, family man and 
friend. 
Mr. Anderson’s tenure as president 
and CEO has been one for the records. 
He led Idaho Power’s parent company, 
IDACORP, to a historic 12 consecutive 
years of earnings growth—an unprece-
dented achievement among investor- 
owned utilities in the United States. In 
2019, the company saw the best em-
ployee safety results ever recorded in 
its history, something Mr. Anderson 
cares deeply about. Under his leader-
ship, Idaho Power also experienced the 
highest customer satisfaction scores 
ever achieved. 
Business results like these deserve 
recognition. But if you ask any one of 
Idaho Power’s nearly 2,000 employees, 
they will tell you Mr. Anderson’s leg-
acy will not be the company’s impres-
sive numbers; it will be that he knew 
their name, showed up for them in good 
times and bad and encouraged them to 
make a commitment to one another 
every single day. Mr. Anderson made 
employees feel valued and respected. 
He acknowledged individual contribu-
tions and inspired employees to do the 
same. 
On June 1, after nearly 24 years with 
the company and serving at its helm 
since 2014, Darrel Anderson is retiring. 
I send my sincerest congratulations to 
my friend and wish him all the best on 
his well-deserved retirement. Idaho 
Power’s reliable, affordable and clean 
energy helps make our great State the 
ideal place to live, and I am grateful 
for his exceptional leadership of this 
outstanding company.∑

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF MISSION 
AVIATION FELLOWSHIP 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, for myself 
and Mr. CRAPO, I want to recognize a 
very special nonprofit organization in 
our State that is celebrating its 75th 
anniversary on May 20. Mission Avia-
tion 
Fellowship, 
or 
MAF, 
headquartered 
in 
Nampa, 
ID, 
was 
formed on May 20, 1945, by veteran pi-
lots who returned from World War II 
with a vision that airplanes could be 
used for peaceful means, bringing med-
icine, education, and the gospel to iso-
lated people around the world. 
One 
of 
their 
founding 
members, 
Betty Greene, served as their first 
pilot, becoming the first woman to fly 
over the Andes in South America and 
the first female pilot in Sudan as she 
traveled the world on behalf of MAF. 
Betty also received a Congressional 
Gold Medal for her wartime service as 
a women Airforce service pilot, WASP. 
She piloted MAF’s very first flight 
from La Habra, CA, to Tuxpan, Mexico, 
and little did she know at the time 
that 
Mission 
Aviation 
Fellowship 
would eventually partner with over 500 
organizations in 13 countries, deliv-
ering medical services and vaccines, as-
sisting with disaster response, and of-
fering physical help and spiritual hope 
for those living in the farthest reaches 
of the world. 
Their work among the most isolated 
people on our planet often goes unno-
ticed, but in 1956, the world was cap-
tivated by the story of MAF pilot Nate 
Saint and four other missionaries who 
were martyred on the banks of the 
Curaray River in Ecuador at the hands 
of Waorani warriors. Undeterred, MAF 
continued to expand its operations 
around the world, and in 2006, they 
moved their headquarters to Nampa, 
ID, to provide their pilots with quality 
backcountry flight training, favorable 
weather, and lower cost of operations. 
The 
Nampa 
headquarters 
hosts 
MAF’s maintenance and training facil-
ity, along with all of the back-office 
functions for its programs around the 
world. The nearly 200 local employees 
and 300 volunteers support another 400 
staff members in foreign countries. 
MAF has a fleet of 47 airplanes that in-
cludes 13 Kodiaks that are made in 
Sandpoint, ID, and are especially well- 
suited for the short, rugged mountain 
top and jungle landing strips in the 
areas they serve. 
Throughout their 75-year history, 
MAF has brought physical help and 
spiritual hope to those living at the 
ends of the Earth—even in the midst of 
wars, disease, and natural disasters. 
They look to serve those that are for-
gotten by the rest of the world, and I 
congratulate them on their 75 years of 
service and thank them for being there 
to provide hope and deliver needed re-
sources in some of the world’s most 
challenging places to reach.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE VETO OF S.J. 
RES. 68, A JOINT RESOLUTION TO 
DIRECT 
THE 
REMOVAL 
OF 
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES 
FROM 
HOSTILITIES 
AGAINST 
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN 
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AUTHOR-
IZED BY CONGRESS—PM 54 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was ordered to be printed 
in the RECORD, spread in full upon the 
Journal, and held at the desk: 
To the Senate of the United States: 
I am returning herewith without my 
approval S.J. Res. 68, a joint resolution 
that purports to direct the President to 
terminate the use of United States 
Armed Forces in hostilities against 
Iran. This indefinite prohibition is un-
necessary and dangerous. It would 
weaken the President’s authority in 
violation of Article II of the Constitu-
tion, and endanger the lives of Amer-
ican citizens and brave service mem-
bers. 
This joint resolution is unnecessary 
because it rests upon a faulty premise. 
Due to my decisive actions and effec-
tive policies, the United States is not 
engaged in the use of force against 
Iran. As Commander in Chief, I will al-
ways defend our Nation against threats 
to our security. 
In response to an escalating series of 
attacks by Iran and Iranian-backed mi-
litias on United States forces and in-
terests in the Middle East, on January 
2, 2020, United States Armed Forces 
eliminated Qassem Soleimani, the head 
of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps-Qods Force as he was traveling 
in Iraq. The purposes of this strike 
were to protect United States per-
sonnel, deter Iran from conducting or 
supporting 
further 
attacks 
against

United States forces and interests, de-
grade the ability of Iran and Qods 
Force-backed militias to conduct at-
tacks, and end Iran’s strategic esca-
lation of attacks against and threats to 
United States interests. 
On January 7, 2020, Iran launched 16 
ballistic missiles against United States 
and coalition forces in Iraq. These at-
tacks resulted in no fatalities. The 
next day, in an address to the Nation, 
I noted that ‘‘Iran appears to be stand-
ing down’’ and emphasized that ‘‘the 
United States is ready to embrace 
peace with all who seek it.’’ 
One day later, this resolution was in-
troduced. Its apparent aim was to pre-
vent an escalation in hostilities be-
tween the United States and Iran. Yet 
no such escalation has occurred over 
the past 4 months, contrary to the 
often dire and confident predictions of 
many. 
S.J. Res. 68 is also unnecessary be-
cause it incorrectly implies that the 
military 
airstrike 
against 
Qassem 
Soleimani in Iraq was conducted with-
out statutory authority. The resolu-
tion states that ‘‘the 2001 Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force (Public 
Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) against 
the perpetrators of the 9/11 attack and 
the Authorization for Use of Military 
Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 
(Public Law 107–243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 
notes) do not serve as a specific statu-
tory authorization for use of force 
against 
Iran.’’ 
The 
strike 
against 
Soleimani, however, was fully author-
ized under both the Authorization for 
Use of Military Force Against Iraq Res-
olution of 2002 (‘‘2002 AUMF’’) and the 
President’s constitutional authorities 
as Commander in Chief and Chief Exec-
utive. 
The United States has long relied 
upon the 2002 AUMF to authorize the 
use of force for the purpose of estab-
lishing a stable, democratic Iraq and 
for addressing terrorist threats ema-
nating from Iraq. Such uses of force 
need not address only threats from the 
Iraqi Government apparatus, but may 
also address threats to the United 
States posed by militias, terrorist 
groups, or other armed groups in Iraq. 
This has been a consistent application 
of the statute across Administrations, 
including 
the 
last 
Administration, 
which relied upon it to conduct oper-
ations in response to attacks and 
threats by Iran-backed militias in Iraq. 
Moreover, under Article II, the Presi-
dent is empowered to direct the use of 
military force to protect the Nation 
from an attack or threat of imminent 
attack and to protect important na-
tional interests. 
In addition, S.J. Res. 68 is dangerous 
because it could hinder the President’s 
ability to protect United States forces, 
allies, and partners, including Israel, 
from the continued threat posed by 
Iran and Iranian-backed militias. The 
resolution states that it should not ‘‘be 
construed to prevent the United States 
from defending itself from imminent 
attack.’’ But this overlooks the Presi-
dent’s need to respond to threats be-
yond imminent attacks on the United 
States and its forces. 
Protecting the national security of 
the United States involves taking ac-
tions to de-escalate threats around the 
world, including threats posed by Iran 
and Iranian-backed militias. Iran and 
Iranian-backed militias have a long 
history of attacking United States and 
coalition forces. As demonstrated by 
the recent indirect fire attacks on Jan-
uary 26, 2020, on the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad and on March 11 and 14, 2020, 
on Camp Taji, Iraq, Iran and Iranian- 
backed militias continue to present a 
threat. This resolution would impede 
the President’s ability to counter ad-
versarial forces by anticipating their 
next moves and taking swift actions to 
address them decisively. 
For all of these reasons, I cannot sup-
port this joint resolution. My Adminis-
tration has taken strong actions, with-
in statutory authority, to help keep 
our Nation safe, and I will not approve 
this resolution, which would under-
mine my ability to protect American 
citizens, service members, and inter-
ests. Therefore, it is my duty to return 
S.J. Res. 68 to the Senate without my 
approval. 
DONALD J. TRUMP.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. REED: 
S. 3619. A bill to amend title II of di-
vision A of the CARES Act to modify 
certain provisions related to unemploy-
ment compensation, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, I 
am introducing the Strengthening UI 
for Coronavirus Impacted Workers and 
Students Act. For the 30 million Amer-
ican unemployed workers, the en-
hanced jobless benefits created in the 
CARES Act are a lifeline. However, the 
Federal 
Pandemic 
Unemployment 
Compensation, which provides a $600- 
per-week benefit on top of an individ-
ual’s regular unemployment insurance 
(UI) benefits are set to expire on July 
31, 2020. Arbitrarily cutting these bene-
fits off in the midst of an ongoing pan-
demic could make a desperate situa-
tion worse for individuals and harm the 
economy. Moreover, if these workers 
are prematurely pushed back into un-
safe work environments, it will ulti-
mately harm families, businesses, and 
communities. 
That is why my new legislation seeks 
to expand and enhance the unemploy-
ment insurance of the CARES Act. 
Specifically, this bill would continue 
to offer out-of-work Americans the 
$600-per-week 
additional 
benefit 
through the end of the year and make 
it retroactive to the date of the 
coronavirus pandemic disaster declara-
tion date. This legislation would also 
exempt these pandemic-specific bene-
fits from being factored into eligibility 
for means-tested programs, such as 
Section 8 housing, SNAP, TANF, and 
WIC. Furthermore, it would create a 
$300 Federal benefit for recent college 
graduates, students, and others who 
are willing and able to work absent 
COVID–19. but who do not have recent 
work history. Finally, this legislation 
would codify guidance by the Depart-
ment of Labor requiring employees 
who are participating in ‘‘work shar-
ing’’ programs to be able to receive the 
$600-per-work boost. I added provisions 
to the CARES Act to Federally finance 
these cost-effective and job saving 
‘‘work sharing’’ programs, which give 
struggling companies the flexibility to 
reduce hours instead of laying off their 
workforce, while allowing the employ-
ees to collect unemployment insurance 
on the days they are not working.

S. 3620. A bill to establish a Housing

JONES, SMITH, WARREN, SINEMA, WAR-
NER, MENENDEZ, VAN HOLLEN, CORTEZ 
MASTO, KAINE, UDALL, BOOKER, FEIN-
STEIN, DURBIN, MERKLEY, and WYDEN, I 
am introducing legislation that would 
create a $75 billion Housing Assistance 
Fund that builds on the success of the 
Hardest Hit Fund at the Treasury De-
partment that I championed in 2010. 
The Hardest Hit Fund provided funds 
to 18 State-level Housing Finance 
Agencies, 
directing 
targeted 
fore-
closure prevention assistance to house-
holds and neighborhoods in States like 
Rhode Island hit hard by the economic 
and housing market downturn. 
The Housing Assistance Fund ex-
pands this model to provide a flexible 
source Federal aid to all State-level 
Housing Finance Agencies. This Fed-
eral funding could then be used to help 
struggling households remain in their 
homes while they search for new em-
ployment or wait to get back to work. 
Financial assistance could go towards 
preventing eviction, mortgage delin-
quency, default, foreclosures, or loss of 
utility services, such as water, gas, and

electricity. Funds could also be used to 
keep the Internet connected and re-
main current with property taxes. 
In the midst of responding to the 
coronavirus, we clearly need to do ev-
erything we can to help our constitu-
ents. According to CNBC, 8.7 million 
jobs were lost in the Great Recession, 
and as of April 23, 2020, more than 26 
million Americans filed unemployment 
insurance claims in just five weeks. 
Just for comparative purposes, CNBC 
also reported that 22.4 million jobs 
were created since the Great Recession. 
This means we’re facing job losses at 
an unprecedented scale and pace. 
What this also means is that we 
could be facing a potential wave of 
evictions and foreclosures, so there is 
no time to waste. We should respond 
accordingly so that more families can 
make it to the other side of this public 
health emergency while staying safe in 
their homes. This is precisely the goal 
of this Housing Assistance Fund legis-
lation we are introducing today. 
I thank the National Council of State 
Housing Agencies; Habitat for Human-
ity; National Housing Conference; Na-
tional Community Reinvestment Coali-
tion; National Association of Afford-
able Housing Lenders; National Leased 
Housing Association; Americans for Fi-
nancial Reform; National Consumer 
Law Center, on behalf of its low-in-
come clients; Center for Responsible 
Lending; Rhode Island Housing; and 
the Rhode Island Association of Real-
tors for their support. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join in 
pressing for inclusion of the Housing 
Assistance Fund in our continued re-
sponse to the coronavirus pandemic.

AWARENESS 
AND 
PREVENTION 
MONTH 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. 
CORNYN, Mr. LEAHY, Ms. ERNST, Mrs. 
MURRAY, and Mr. GRASSLEY) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 560 
Whereas the Senate is committed to the 
awareness, prevention, and deterrence of sex-
ual violence affecting individuals in the 
United States; 
Whereas, according to the National Crime 
Victimization Survey, between 2008 and 2018, 
approximately— 
(1) 3,434,326 women were victims of rape 
and sexual assault; and 
(2) 523,895 men were victims of rape and 
sexual assault; 
Whereas, due to the unprecedented chal-
lenges presented by the COVID–19 pandemic, 
including mandatory stay-at-home orders, 
the needs of sexual assault victims have be-
come even more complex and challenging; 
Whereas, according to a March 2020 survey 
by the National Alliance to End Sexual Vio-
lence of more than 600 rape crisis programs, 
89 percent of those programs need emergency 
stimulus funding to respond to requests from 
survivors for support and emergency assist-
ance; 
Whereas, according to the March 2020 sur-
vey, since the onset of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, 40 percent of the programs surveyed 
have experienced an increased demand for 
services both in terms of new requests and 
more dire and complicated requests from ex-
isting clients, including requests relating to 
technology needs for virtual services and 
emergency needs of vulnerable survivors; 
Whereas, during the pandemic, many rape 
crisis centers have had to cancel signature 
fundraisers and have experienced overall de-
creases in private donations; 
Whereas, according to the 2018 Child Mal-
treatment Report of the Department of 
Health and Human Services, in 2018, child 
protective services agencies substantiated or 
found strong evidence to indicate that 47,124 
children under 18 years of age were victims 
of sexual abuse; 
Whereas, according to the National Crime 
Victimization Survey, between 2014 and 2018, 
an average of only 29 percent of rapes or sex-
ual assaults in the United States were re-
ported to law enforcement agencies; 
Whereas studies have suggested that the 
rate at which American Indians and Alaska 
Natives experience sexual violence is signifi-
cantly higher than for other populations in 
the United States; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, more than 1⁄2 of 
all female rape victims reported being raped 
by an intimate partner; 
Whereas sexual violence is a burden for 
many individuals who serve in the Armed 
Forces, and the Department of Defense esti-
mates that approximately 20,500 members of 
the Armed Forces, including approximately 
13,000 women and 7,500 men, experienced 
some form of contact or penetrative sexual 
assault during 2018; 
Whereas sexual assault does not discrimi-
nate on any basis and can affect any indi-
vidual in the United States; 
Whereas sexual violence may take many 
forms, 
including 
acquaintance, 
stranger, 
spousal, and gang rape, incest, child sexual 
abuse, elder sexual abuse, sexual abuse and 
exploitation of disabled persons, commercial 
sex trafficking, sexual harassment, and 
stalking; 
Whereas, according to the National Alli-
ance to End Sexual Violence, in addition to 
immediate physical and emotional costs, 
sexual assault can have numerous adverse 
consequences for the victim, which may in-
clude post-traumatic stress disorder, sub-
stance abuse, major depression, homeless-
ness, eating disorders, and suicide; 
Whereas, according to a 2019 survey of rape 
crisis centers by the National Alliance to 
End Sexual Violence, 1⁄2 of such centers have 
a waiting list, in some cases months long, for 
counseling services, 44 percent lack a thera-
pist on staff, and 84 percent have experienced 
an increased demand for services; 
Whereas many sexual assaults are not re-
ported to law enforcement agencies, and 
many States have restrictive criminal stat-
utes of limitations, which enable many per-
petrators to evade punishment for their 
crimes; 
Whereas advances in deoxyribonucleic acid 
(commonly known as ‘‘DNA’’) technology 
have enabled law enforcement agencies to 
identify and prosecute the perpetrators in 
tens of thousands of previously unsolved sex-
ual assault cases; 
Whereas incarceration of sexual assault 
perpetrators can prevent perpetrators from 
committing additional crimes; 
Whereas national, State, territorial, and 
Tribal coalitions, community-based rape cri-
sis centers, and other organizations across 
the United States are committed to— 
(1) increasing public awareness of sexual 
violence and the prevalence of sexual vio-
lence; and 
(2) eliminating sexual violence through 
prevention and education; 
Whereas important partnerships have been 
formed among criminal and juvenile justice 
agencies, health professionals, public health 
workers, educators, first responders, and vic-
tim service providers; 
Whereas thousands of volunteers and staff 
at rape crisis centers, State coalitions 
against sexual assault, and nonprofit organi-
zations across the United States play an im-
portant role in making crisis hotlines and 
other services available to survivors of sex-
ual assault; 
Whereas free, confidential help is available 
to all victims and survivors of sexual assault 
through— 
(1) the National Sexual Assault Hotline— 
(A) by telephone at 800–656–HOPE; and

Whereas the victim service programs of 
the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network 
(commonly known as ‘‘RAINN’’), including 
the National Sexual Assault Hotline— 
(1) in 2019, helped 304,275 survivors of sex-
ual assault and their loved ones, which rep-
resented the greatest number of people as-
sisted since the founding of the hotline in 
1994; and 
(2) continue to receive a record number of

offer support and help to members of the De-
partment of Defense community— 
(1) by telephone at 877–995–5247; and 
(2) online at https://safehelpline.org; 
Whereas individual and collective efforts 
reflect the dream of the people of the United 
States— 
(1) for individuals and organizations to ac-
tively work to prevent all forms of sexual vi-
olence; and 
(2) for no victim of sexual assault to be 
unserved or feel that there is no path to jus-
tice; and 
Whereas April 2020 is recognized as ‘‘Na-
tional Sexual Assault Awareness and Preven-
tion Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) it is the sense of the Senate that— 
(A) National Sexual Assault Awareness and 
Prevention Month provides a special oppor-
tunity to— 
(i) educate the people of the United States 
about sexual violence; and 
(ii) encourage— 
(I) the prevention of sexual assault; 
(II) improvement in the treatment of sur-
vivors of sexual assault; and 
(III) the prosecution of perpetrators of sex-
ual assault; 
(B) it is appropriate to properly acknowl-
edge survivors of sexual assault and to com-
mend the volunteers and professionals who 
assist those survivors in their efforts to heal; 
(C) national and community organizations 
and private sector supporters should be rec-
ognized and applauded for their work in— 
(i) promoting awareness about sexual as-

(ii) providing information and treatment 
to survivors of sexual assault; and 
(iii) increasing the number of successful 
prosecutions of perpetrators of sexual as-
sault; and 
(D) public safety, law enforcement, and 
health professionals should be recognized 
and applauded for their hard work and inno-
vative strategies to ensure perpetrators of 
sexual assault are held accountable; and

submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 561 
Whereas, 
beginning 
in 
1991, 
National 
Nurses Week is celebrated annually from 
May 6, also known as ‘‘National Recognition 
Day for Nurses’’, through May 12, the birth-
day of Florence Nightingale, the founder of 
modern nursing; 
Whereas, in 2020, National Nurses Week 
falls within the International Year of the 
Nurse and the Midwife, as designated by the 
World Health Organization; 
Whereas National Nurses Week is a time of 
year to reflect on the important contribu-
tions that nurses make to provide safe, high- 
quality health care; 
Whereas nurses serve on the front lines, 
risking their lives treating the injured and 
sick during wartime, natural disasters, and 
pandemics, including the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas nurses are known to be patient 
advocates, acting to protect the lives of indi-
viduals under their care; 
Whereas nurses represent the largest single 
component of the health care professions, 
with an estimated population of more than 
4,000,000 registered nurses in the United 
States; 
Whereas nurses are leading in the delivery 
of quality care in a transformed health care 
system that improves patient outcomes and 
safety; 
Whereas the Future of Nursing report of 
the Institute of Medicine has called for the 
nursing profession to meet the call for lead-
ership in a team-based delivery model; 
Whereas, when nurse staffing levels in-
crease, the risk of patient complications and 
lengthy hospital stays decreases, resulting in 
cost savings; 
Whereas nurses are experienced research-
ers, and the work of nurses encompasses a 
wide scope of scientific inquiry, including 
clinical research, health systems and out-
comes research, and nursing education re-
search; 
Whereas nurses provide care that is sen-
sitive to the cultures and customs of individ-
uals across the United States; 
Whereas nurses are well-positioned to pro-
vide leadership to eliminate health care dis-
parities that exist in the United States; 
Whereas nurses are the cornerstone of the 
public 
health 
infrastructure, 
promoting 
healthy lifestyles and educating commu-
nities on disease prevention and health pro-
motion; 
Whereas nurses help inform and educate, 
and work closely with, legislators to im-
prove— 
(1) the education, retention, recruitment, 
and practice of all nurses; and 
(2) the health and safety of the patients for 
whom the nurses care; 
Whereas there is a need— 
(1) to strengthen nursing workforce devel-
opment programs at all levels, including the 
number of doctorally prepared faculty mem-
bers; and 
(2) to provide education to the nurse re-
search scientists who can develop new nurs-
ing care models to improve the health status 
of the diverse population of the United 
States; 
Whereas nurses touch the lives of the peo-
ple of the United States through every stage 
of life; and 
Whereas nursing has been voted the most 
honest and ethical profession in the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Nurses Week, as founded by the Amer-
ican Nurses Association; 
(2) recognizes the significant contributions 
of nurses to the health care system in the 
United States; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe National Nurses Week with 
appropriate recognition, ceremonies, activi-
ties, and programs to demonstrate the im-
portance of nurses to the everyday lives of 
patients.

AWARENESS DAY’’ 
Mrs. LOEFFLER (for herself, Mr. 
CASEY, and Ms. HASSAN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 562 
Whereas cerebral palsy is a group of per-
manent disorders that impact movement and 
posture and is attributed to nonprogressive 
disturbances that occur in the developing 
brain; 
Whereas cerebral palsy, the most common 
motor disability in children, is caused by 
damage to 1 or more specific areas of the de-
veloping brain, which usually occurs during 
fetal development before, during, or after 
birth; 
Whereas the majority of children who have 
cerebral palsy are born with the condition, 
but it may be undetected for months or 
years; 
Whereas 75 percent of individuals with cer-
ebral palsy also have 1 or more develop-
mental disabilities, including epilepsy, an in-
tellectual disability, autism, a visual impair-
ment, or blindness; 
Whereas, according to information pub-
lished by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention— 
(1) the prevalence of cerebral palsy is not 
changing over time; and 
(2) an estimated 1 in 323 children has cere-
bral palsy; 
Whereas approximately 1,000,000 individ-
uals in the United States are affected by cer-
ebral palsy; 
Whereas, although there is no cure for cer-
ebral palsy, treatment often improves the 
capabilities of a child with the condition; 
Whereas scientists and researchers are 
hopeful for breakthroughs in cerebral palsy 
research; 
Whereas researchers across the United 
States conduct important studies involving 
cerebral palsy; and 
Whereas the Senate can raise awareness of 
cerebral palsy for the public and within the 
medical community: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 25, 2020, as ‘‘National 
Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day’’; and 
(2) encourages each individual in the 
United States to become better informed 
about and aware of cerebral palsy.

Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. WYDEN, Ms. COLLINS, 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, Mrs. BLACKBURN, 
Mrs. LOEFFLER, Mr. DURBIN, and Ms.

tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 563 
Whereas National Women’s History Month 
recognizes and spreads awareness of the im-
portance of women in the history of the 
United States; 
Whereas, throughout the history of the 
United States, whether in their homes, in 
their workplaces, in schools, in the courts, 
or during wartime, women have fought for 
themselves, their families, and all people of 
the United States; 
Whereas, in 1987, President Ronald Reagan 
issued a Presidential proclamation pro-
claiming March 1987 as ‘‘Women’s History 
Month’’; and 
Whereas, despite the advancements of 
women in the United States, much remains 
to be done to ensure that women realize 
their full potential as equal members of soci-
ety in the United States: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 2020 as ‘‘National 
Women’s History Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the celebration of National 
Women’s History Month as a time to reflect 
on the many notable contributions that 
women have made to the United States; and 
(3) urges the people of the United States to 
observe National Women’s History Month 
with appropriate programs and activities. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in honor of Women’s History 
Month to recognize the tremendous 
achievements women have made for 
the United States and pay tribute to 
the vital role they have played in the 
political, economic, and social develop-
ment of this Nation. 
What began as a local celebration of 
women in Santa Rosa, California more 
than 40 years ago, has grown to become 
a nationally observed month of reflec-
tion on the many accomplishments of 
American women. 
Women’s History Month gives us the 
opportunity to honor the many con-
tributions women have made, while 
also inspiring the next generation of 
women leaders. 
I look upon the courage our prede-
cessors displayed with great admira-
tion, and I continue to be inspired by 
those who blazed the trail for women 
like me. 
This year, the United States cele-
brates the 100th anniversary of the 
ratification of the 19th Amendment to 
the Constitution of the United States, 
which guarantees women the right to 
vote. I am inspired by the progress 
we’ve made over the past 100 years and 
hopeful we will continue to build on 
that momentum toward full equality. 
When I first came to Washington in 
1992, they called it the ‘‘Year of the 
Woman.’’ Only two other women were 
serving in the Senate, and four women 
had just been elected to the chamber, 
myself included. 
Today, 26 women serve in the Senate 
and 105 women serve in the House, in-
cluding the only woman to have served 
as Speaker. 
I’m proud to say that my home State 
of California has now sent 43 women to 
Congress and leads all other States in 
this regard. 
Even at these historic levels, the 
number of women in Congress falls far 
short of the 51 percent of women mem-
bers we should expect based on the 
country’s demographics. 
I have great confidence that future 
generations of women will continue to 
rise up and help lead the way in build-
ing a better California and United 
States. 
As with government, the business 
world has been transformed by power-
ful women at the table, as have the 
fields of science, music, film, athletics, 
literature, and many more. 
Women also serve in critical roles in 
the military, with more than 200,000 ac-
tive-duty servicewomen proudly serv-
ing with honor, courage, and distinc-
tion and a growing number of women 
veterans representing every branch of 
service. 
The gains this Nation has made in 
terms of social progress would not have 
been possible without the extraor-
dinary efforts of women. As women 
have fought for themselves, their fami-
lies, and their communities, so too 
have they fought for all Americans. 
As a senator proudly representing 
California, I ask you to join me in cele-
brating the stories and greatness of 
American women who accomplished so 
much by continuing to defend the 
rights they worked so hard to attain. 
Thank you Mr. President and I yield 
the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2296 
May 6, 2020 
To the Senate of the United States: 
I am returning herewith without my 
approval S.J. Res. 68, a joint resolution 
that purports to direct the President to 
terminate the use of United States 
Armed Forces in hostilities against 
Iran. This indefinite prohibition is un-
necessary and dangerous. It would 
weaken the President’s authority in 
violation of Article II of the Constitu-
tion, and endanger the lives of Amer-
ican citizens and brave service mem-
bers. 
This joint resolution is unnecessary 
because it rests upon a faulty premise. 
Due to my decisive actions and effec-
tive policies, the United States is not 
engaged in the use of force against 
Iran. As Commander in Chief, I will al-
ways defend our Nation against threats 
to our security. 
In response to an escalating series of 
attacks by Iran and Iranian-backed mi-
litias on United States forces and in-
terests in the Middle East, on January 
2, 2020, United States Armed Forces 
eliminated Qassem Soleimani, the head 
of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps-Qods Force as he was traveling 
in Iraq. The purposes of this strike 
were to protect United States per-
sonnel, deter Iran from conducting or 
supporting 
further 
attacks 
against 
United States forces and interests, de-
grade the ability of Iran and Qods 
Force-backed militias to conduct at-
tacks, and end Iran’s strategic esca-
lation of attacks against and threats to 
United States interests. 
On January 7, 2020, Iran launched 16 
ballistic missiles against United States 
and coalition forces in Iraq. These at-
tacks resulted in no fatalities. The 
next day, in an address to the Nation, 
I noted that ‘‘Iran appears to be stand-
ing down’’ and emphasized that ‘‘the 
United States is ready to embrace 
peace with all who seek it.’’ 
One day later, this resolution was in-
troduced. Its apparent aim was to pre-
vent an escalation in hostilities be-
tween the United States and Iran. Yet 
no such escalation has occurred over 
the past 4 months, contrary to the 
often dire and confident predictions of 
many. 
S.J. Res. 68 is also unnecessary be-
cause it incorrectly implies that the 
military 
airstrike 
against 
Qassem 
Soleimani in Iraq was conducted with-
out statutory authority. The resolu-
tion states that ‘‘the 2001 Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force (Public 
Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) against 
the perpetrators of the 9/11 attack and 
the Authorization for Use of Military 
Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 
(Public Law 107–243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 
notes) do not serve as a specific statu-
tory authorization for use of force 
against 
Iran.’’ 
The 
strike 
against 
Soleimani, however, was fully author-
ized under both the Authorization for 
Use of Military Force Against Iraq Res-
olution of 2002 (‘‘2002 AUMF’’) and the 
President’s constitutional authorities 
as Commander in Chief and Chief Exec-
utive. 
The United States has long relied 
upon the 2002 AUMF to authorize the 
use of force for the purpose of estab-
lishing a stable, democratic Iraq and 
for addressing terrorist threats ema-
nating from Iraq. Such uses of force 
need not address only threats from the 
Iraqi Government apparatus, but may 
also address threats to the United 
States posed by militias, terrorist 
groups, or other armed groups in Iraq. 
This has been a consistent application 
of the statute across Administrations, 
including 
the 
last 
Administration, 
which relied upon it to conduct oper-
ations in response to attacks and 
threats by Iran-backed militias in Iraq. 
Moreover, under Article II, the Presi-
dent is empowered to direct the use of 
military force to protect the Nation 
from an attack or threat of imminent 
attack and to protect important na-
tional interests. 
In addition, S.J. Res. 68 is dangerous 
because it could hinder the President’s 
ability to protect United States forces, 
allies, and partners, including Israel, 
from the continued threat posed by 
Iran and Iranian-backed militias. The 
resolution states that it should not ‘‘be 
construed to prevent the United States 
from defending itself from imminent 
attack.’’ But this overlooks the Presi-
dent’s need to respond to threats be-
yond imminent attacks on the United 
States and its forces. 
Protecting the national security of 
the United States involves taking ac-
tions to de-escalate threats around the 
world, including threats posed by Iran 
and Iranian-backed militias. Iran and 
Iranian-backed militias have a long 
history of attacking United States and 
coalition forces. As demonstrated by 
the recent indirect fire attacks on Jan-
uary 26, 2020, on the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad and on March 11 and 14, 2020, 
on Camp Taji, Iraq, Iran and Iranian- 
backed militias continue to present a 
threat. This resolution would impede 
the President’s ability to counter ad-
versarial forces by anticipating their 
next moves and taking swift actions to 
address them decisively. 
For all of these reasons, I cannot sup-
port this joint resolution. My adminis-
tration has taken strong actions, with-
in statutory authority, to help keep 
our Nation safe, and I will not approve 
this resolution, which would under-
mine my ability to protect American 
citizens, service members, and inter-
ests. Therefore, it is my duty to return 
S.J. Res. 68 to the Senate without my 
approval.
