PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
From before the beginning of time, 
God, You have been for us. In eternity 
past, You had Your hand in both our 
creation and in our redemption. 
May we appreciate the lives You have 
given us, and deliver us from our indul-
gence which squanders the opportuni-
ties You have provided. 
May we understand that You have 
given us dominion over the Earth, and 
disavow us of the prideful notion that 
we alone are masters of our own exist-
ence. 
May we see the perfect design You 
conceived at creation, and forgive us 
our destructive disregard for Your 
handiwork. 
Most important, may we receive the 
love You have shown us, and show us 
mercy when our lives reflect, instead, 
hate and indifference. 
Recreate us, O Lord, to live into 
Your prevenient plan. We stand in need 
of Your redemptive grace. 
In the strength of Your eternal name 
we pray. 
Amen.

IN SUPPORT OF THE FOR THE 
PEOPLE ACT 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act. 
Included in this important legisla-
tion is the Vote by Mail Tracking Act, 
legislation I introduced to ensure that 
all ballots in Federal elections have a 
Postal Service barcode. 
This would enable election officials 
and the public to track the status of a 
ballot from when it is put in the mail 
to when it is delivered, reducing anx-
iety, 
increasing 
accuracy, 
trans-
parency, and accountability for our 
ballots. 
After an election year with record- 
breaking numbers of Americans voting 
by mail, it has never been more critical 
to provide election officials and the 
public peace of mind that every vote 
matters and is counted accurately. 
I urge overwhelming support for H.R. 
1, which includes reforms across our 
Government that are critically impor-
tant, and it includes this important 
bill, too. 
HONORING THE SERVICE AND 
SACRIFICE OF K–9 OFFICER LUNA 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to mourn the 
tragic loss of K–9 Luna, a beloved mem-
ber of the Duluth Police Department, 
who was shot and killed in the line of 
duty last week. 
Luna was a 3-year-old Dutch Shep-
herd who joined the department’s K–9 
unit less than 2 years ago, after her 
handler, Officer Aaron Haller, lost his 
K–9 partner, Haas, in a similar inci-
dent. 
As a former Duluth police officer 
with the Duluth Police Department, I 
know firsthand that our K–9 partners 
perform their duties bravely and with 
great loyalty. 
To their handlers, a K–9 is more than 
a dog. They are a partner, protector, 
and a valued family member. K–9 offi-
cers go home with their handlers each 
night, so their dedication to their han-
dlers and their job does not end after 
each workday. 
K–9 Luna was a guardian of the Du-
luth community. She died a hero’s 
death, giving her life to protect her 
partner and fellow officers on the 
scene. 
My heart is with Luna’s handler, Of-
ficer Aaron Haller, the Haller family, 
and the entire Duluth Police Depart-
ment during this time of deep sorrow. 
I know it cannot be easy to say good-
bye to such a good and loving friend. I 
speak for the entire Duluth community 
when I say that we are eternally grate-
ful for Luna’s service and sacrifice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H886 
March 2, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 1, the For the People 
Act. 
I have said since day one on this job 
that if you want to do big and trans-
formational things in America, you 
first have to get rid of big money in 
politics. 
Whether you want to tackle the cli-
mate crisis, reform healthcare, address 
the gun violence epidemic, or level the 
playing field for American workers, it 
is all about shutting off the flow of big 
money, ending gerrymandering, bol-
stering our ethics laws, and expanding 
access to the ballot box. H.R. 1 will do 
all of these things. 
This transformational package in-
cludes my bill, the End Dark Money 
Act, to crack down on mega-donors 
who hide their political contributions 
through phony social welfare organiza-
tions. 
If we have learned anything in the 
past few years, it is that our democ-
racy is in need of reform. We can and 
must do big things again, and it begins 
by passing H.R. 1. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
this historic effort. 
f 
PRIORITIZE SAVE OUR STAGES 
FUNDING 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak for thou-
sands of music venues, movie theaters, 
and museums that are struggling to 
survive the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Over the past year, Congress has 
come together in a bipartisan manner 
to pass over $3.5 trillion in pandemic 
assistance. While much of this aid was 
necessary, 
government 
bureaucracy 
has routinely delayed getting this 
money into the hands of the American 
people. As of today, there are still $1.3 
trillion in unspent COVID–19 relief. 
In December, the House passed my 
bipartisan Save our Stages Act, which 
established the $15 billion Shuttered 
Venue Operators Grant, providing di-
rect relief for music venues, movie the-
aters, and museums devastated by the 
pandemic. These businesses were the 
first to close and will be some of the 
last to reopen. 
Nine weeks have passed since Presi-
dent Trump signed this into law, and 
the SBA still has not even produced 
the application for venue owners to 
apply. At this rate, some grants won’t 
be delivered until summer. 
This is unacceptable, and the SBA 
needs to get to work immediately. 
Every day we wait, there is another 
door that permanently closes. The bot-
tom line is: The shows must go on. 
In God we trust. 
f 
REMEMBERING 
UNITED 
STATES 
AIR FORCE COLONEL EXA FAY 
HOOTEN 
(Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember and honor a great 
West Texan, United States Air Force 
Colonel Exa Fay Hooten, of Abilene, 
Texas. She passed away on January 16 
at the age of 92. She was born on Au-
gust 27, 1928, in Floydada, Texas, to 
Maude Latham and Richard W. Hooten. 
After graduating high school, she at-
tended Texas Tech University, where 
she received a bachelor’s degree and 
then later received her Ph.D. from 
Texas Women’s University. 
Exa Fay believed travel was second 
in importance only to a college edu-
cation. She joined the Air Force and 
traveled the world working in military 
hospitals, taking care of our wounded 
warriors. After Active Duty, she en-
tered the Reserves and was the first 
U.S. Air Force Reserve dietician to ob-
tain the rank of full colonel. 
I thank Colonel Hooten for her serv-
ice and patriotism. I thank her for 
showing us that, like the West Texas 
horizon, the possibilities of life are 
limitless when you pursue your passion 
and put others first. 
God bless, and go West Texas. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CARTER SMITH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize and congratulate Carter Smith of 
Cresson, Pennsylvania. Carter has ac-
cepted a fully qualified appointment to 
the United States Military Academy at 
West Point. Carter is the son of Gary 
and Holly Lynne Smith. 
As a student at Penn Cambria High 
School, Carter was heavily involved in 
the speech club, theater, and the Na-
tional Honor Society, as well as both 
the football and basketball teams. 
In addition to having a long resume 
of extracurricular activities, Carter 
has excelled in the classroom as well, 
maintaining a 4.0 GPA. 
April 
Gergely, 
Carter’s 
English 
teacher, 
had 
nothing 
but 
positive 
things to say about him in her letter of 
recommendation. 
She said: ‘‘Carter stood out as an ex-
tremely hardworking, intelligent, per-
ceptive, detail-oriented, honest, reli-
able, and mature student.’’ 
I am confident Carter’s experience in 
and out of the classroom will serve him 
well as he looks forward to this excit-
ing new phase of life. 
I thank Carter for his commitment 
to our Nation, and I wish him the best 
of luck at West Point. 
f 
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN 
BURMA 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to raise awareness of the grave 
human rights violations taking place 
in Burma, also known as Myanmar. 
For decades, the country of Burma 
has been working diligently to estab-
lish credible elections, democratic ci-
vilian governance, and a peaceful tran-
sition of power. 
However, this progress came to a halt 
after the military violently seized con-
trol on February 1, 2021. The military 
has since used this unlawful control to 
violently oppress ethnic minorities, in-
cluding firing artillery into Burmese 
villages and displacing over 7,000 peo-
ple. 
Peaceful protests for freedom have 
been met with deadly force, killing 18 
and imprisoning nearly 700. One pro-
tester, a 16-year-old boy, was report-
edly shot in the head by an army snip-
er. 
Utica, New York, my hometown, is 
home to over 4,000 Burmese refugees 
and new Burmese-American citizens. 
Many fear for the lives of their friends 
and families in peril in Burma. 
In Utica, they have peacefully stood 
in solidarity with their home country, 
holding signs that say, ‘‘Save Democ-
racy, Save Burma.’’ 
I met recently with a group of these 
refugees to hear their grim accounts of 
the conditions in their native country. 
Their passion and courage are inspir-
ing. 
We must also condemn the cruelty 
and genocide against the Rohingya 
people, an ethnic minority who also 
desperately need our support and as-
sistance. 
The U.S. remains a symbol of democ-
racy to the world. I urge my colleagues 
to join me in supporting the Burmese 
people in their quest for freedom and 
democracy.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 179, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 1) to expand Americans’ 
access to the ballot box, reduce the in-
fluence of big money in politics,

ants, and implement other anti-corrup-
tion measures for the purpose of for-

purposes, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS OF GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL 
AUTHORITY. 
Congress finds that the Constitution of the 
United States grants explicit and broad author-
ity to protect the right to vote, to regulate elec-
tions for Federal office, to prevent and remedy 
discrimination in voting, and to defend the Na-
tion’s democratic process. Congress enacts the 
‘‘For the People Act of 2021’’ pursuant to this 
broad authority, including but not limited to the 
following: 
(1) Congress finds that it has broad authority 
to regulate the time, place, and manner of con-
gressional elections under the Elections Clause 
of the Constitution, article I, section 4, clause 1. 
The Supreme Court has affirmed that the ‘‘sub-
stantive scope’’ of the Elections Clause is 
‘‘broad’’; that ‘‘Times, Places, and Manner’’ are 
‘‘comprehensive words which embrace authority 
to provide for a complete code for congressional 
elections’’; and ‘‘[t]he power of Congress over 
the Times, Places and Manner of congressional 
elections is paramount, and may be exercised at 
any time, and to any extent which it deems ex-
pedient; and so far as it is exercised, and no far-
ther, the regulations effected supersede those of 
the State which are inconsistent therewith’’. Ar-
izona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 
U.S. 1, 8–9 (2013) (internal quotation marks and 
citations omitted). Indeed, ‘‘Congress has ple-
nary and paramount jurisdiction over the whole 
subject’’ of congressional elections, Ex parte 
Siebold, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 371, 388 (1879), and 
this power ‘‘may be exercised as and when Con-
gress sees fit’’, and ‘‘so far as it extends and 
conflicts with the regulations of the State, nec-
essarily supersedes them’’. Id. At 384. Among 
other things, Congress finds that the Elections 
Clause was intended to ‘‘vindicate the people’s 
right to equality of representation in the 
House’’. Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 16 
(1964), and to address partisan gerrymandering, 
Rucho v. Common Cause, 588 U. S. llll, 32- 
33 (2019). 
(2) Congress also finds that it has both the au-
thority and responsibility, as the legislative 
body for the United States, to fulfill the promise 
of article IV, section 4, of the Constitution, 
which states: ‘‘The United States shall guar-
antee to every State in this Union a Republican 
Form of Government[.]’’. Congress finds that its 
authority and responsibility to enforce the 
Guarantee Clause is particularly strong given 
that Federal courts have not enforced this 
clause because they understood that its enforce-
ment is committed to Congress by the Constitu-
tion. 
(3)(A) Congress also finds that it has broad 
authority pursuant to section 5 of the Four-
teenth Amendment to legislate to enforce the 
provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, in-
cluding its protections of the right to vote and 
the democratic process. 
(B) Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment 
protects the fundamental right to vote, which is 
‘‘of the most fundamental significance under 
our constitutional structure’’. Ill. Bd. of Elec-
tion v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 
(1979); see United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299 
(1941) (‘‘Obviously included within the right to 
choose, secured by the Constitution, is the right 
of qualified voters within a state to cast their 
ballots and have them counted . . .’’). As the Su-
preme Court has repeatedly affirmed, the right 
to vote is ‘‘preservative of all rights’’, Yick Wo 
v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886). Section 2 of 
the Fourteenth Amendment also protects the 
right to vote, granting Congress additional au-
thority to reduce a State’s representation in 
Congress when the right to vote is abridged or 
denied. 
(C) As a result, Congress finds that it has the 
authority pursuant to section 5 of the Four-
teenth Amendment to protect the right to vote. 
Congress also finds that States and localities 
have eroded access to the right to vote through 
restrictions on the right to vote including exces-
sively onerous voter identification requirements, 
burdensome voter registration procedures, voter 
purges, limited and unequal access to voting by 
mail, polling place closures, unequal distribu-
tion of election resources, and other impedi-
ments. 
(D) Congress also finds that ‘‘the right of suf-
frage can be denied by a debasement or dilution 
of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effec-
tively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise 
of the franchise’’. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 
533, 555 (1964). Congress finds that the right of 
suffrage has been so diluted and debased by 
means of gerrymandering of districts. Congress 
finds that it has authority pursuant to section 
5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to remedy this 
debasement. 
(4)(A) Congress also finds that it has author-
ity to legislate to eliminate racial discrimination 
in voting and the democratic process pursuant 
to both section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, 
which grants equal protection of the laws, and 
section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, which ex-
plicitly bars denial or abridgment of the right to 
vote on account of race, color, or previous con-
dition of servitude. 
(B) Congress finds that racial discrimination 
in access to voting and the political process per-
sists. Voting restrictions, redistricting, and other 
electoral practices and processes continue to dis-
proportionately impact communities of color in 
the United States and do so as a result of both 
intentional racial discrimination, structural rac-
ism, and the ongoing structural socioeconomic 
effects of historical racial discrimination. 
(C) Recent elections and studies have shown 
that minority communities wait longer in lines 
to vote, are more likely to have their mail ballots 
rejected, continue to face intimidation at the 
polls, are more likely to be disenfranchised by 
voter purges, and are disproportionately bur-
dened by voter identification and other voter re-
strictions. Research shows that communities of 
color are more likely to face nearly every barrier 
to voting than their white counterparts. 
(D) Congress finds that racial disparities in 
disenfranchisement due to past felony convic-
tions is particularly stark. In 2020, according to

than that of non-African Americans. In seven 
States–Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, 
Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming–more than 
one 
in 
seven 
African 
Americans 
is 
disenfranchised, twice the national average for 
African Americans. Congress finds that felony 
disenfranchisement was one of the tools of in-
tentional racial discrimination during the Jim 
Crow era. Congress further finds that current 
racial disparities in felony disenfranchisement 
are linked to this history of voter suppression, 
structural racism in the criminal justice system, 
and ongoing effects of historical discrimination. 
(5)(A) Congress finds that it further has the 
power to protect the right to vote from denial or 
abridgment on account of sex, age, or ability to 
pay a poll tax or other tax pursuant to the 
Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth 
Amendments. 
(B) Congress finds that electoral practices in-
cluding voting rights restoration conditions for 
people with convictions, voter identification re-
quirements, and other restrictions to the fran-
chise burden voters on account of their ability 
to pay. 
(C) Congress further finds that electoral prac-
tices including voting restrictions related to col-
lege campuses, age restrictions on mail voting, 
and similar practices burden the right to vote on 
account of age. 
SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—For any action brought for 
declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge, 
whether facially or as-applied, the constitu-

Act or any amendment made by this Act or any 
rule or regulation promulgated under this Act, 
the following rules shall apply: 
(1) The action shall be filed in the United 
States District Court for the District of Colum-
bia and an appeal from the decision of the dis-
trict court may be taken to the Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit. These 
courts, and the Supreme Court of the United 
States on a writ of certiorari (if such a writ is 
issued), shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear 
such actions. 
(2) The party filing the action shall concur-
rently deliver a copy the complaint to the Clerk 
of the House of Representatives and the Sec-
retary of the Senate. 
(3) It shall be the duty of the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia and 
the Court of Appeals for the District of Colum-
bia Circuit to advance on the docket and to ex-
pedite to the greatest possible extent the disposi-
tion of the action and appeal. 
(b) CLARIFYING SCOPE OF JURISDICTION.—If an 
action at the time of its commencement is not 
subject to subsection (a), but an amendment, 
counterclaim, cross-claim, affirmative defense, 
or any other pleading or motion is filed chal-
lenging, whether facially or as-applied, the con-
stitutionality or lawfulness of this Act or any 
amendment made by this Act or any rule or reg-
ulation promulgated under this Act, the district 
court shall transfer the action to the District 
Court for the District of Columbia, and the ac-
tion shall thereafter be conducted pursuant to 
subsection (a).

(including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner 
to the Congress) or Senate shall have the right 
to intervene either in support of or opposition to 
the position of a party to the case regarding the 
constitutionality of the provision. To avoid du-
plication of efforts and reduce the burdens 
placed on the parties to the action, the court in 
any such action may make such orders as it 
considers necessary, including orders to require 
interveners taking similar positions to file joint 
papers or to be represented by a single attorney 
at oral argument.

(A) the right to vote is a fundamental right of 
citizens of the United States; 
(B) it is the responsibility of the State and 
Federal Governments to ensure that every eligi-
ble citizen is registered to vote; 
(C) existing voter registration systems can be 
inaccurate, costly, inaccessible and confusing, 
with damaging effects on voter participation in 
elections for Federal office and disproportionate 
impacts on young people, persons with disabil-
ities, and racial and ethnic minorities; and 
(D) voter registration systems must be updated 
with 21st Century technologies and procedures 
to maintain their security. 
(2) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this part— 
(A) to establish that it is the responsibility of 
government at every level to ensure that all eli-
gible citizens are registered to vote in elections 
for Federal office;

ments to register all eligible citizens to vote with 
accurate, cost-efficient, and up-to-date proce-
dures;

curacy, efficiency, and accessibility of the elec-
toral process for all eligible citizens.

BLE INDIVIDUALS. 
(a) REQUIRING STATES TO ESTABLISH AND OP-
ERATE AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION SYSTEM.—

cial of each State shall establish and operate a 
system of automatic registration for the registra-
tion of eligible individuals to vote for elections

with the provisions of this part. 
(2) DEFINITION.—The term ‘‘automatic reg-
istration’’ means a system that registers an indi-
vidual to vote in elections for Federal office in 
a State, if eligible, by electronically transferring 
the information necessary for registration from 
government agencies to election officials of the 
State so that, unless the individual affirmatively 
declines to be registered, the individual will be 
registered to vote in such elections. 
(b) REGISTRATION OF VOTERS BASED ON NEW 
AGENCY RECORDS.—The chief State election offi-
cial shall— 
(1) not later than 15 days after a contributing 
agency has transmitted information with respect 
to an individual pursuant to section 1013, en-
sure that the individual is registered to vote in 
elections for Federal office in the State if the in-
dividual is eligible to be registered to vote in 
such elections; and 
(2) not later than 120 days after a contrib-
uting agency has transmitted such information 
with respect to the individual, send written no-
tice to the individual, in addition to other 
means of notice established by this part, of the 
individual’s voter registration status. 
(c) ONE-TIME REGISTRATION OF VOTERS BASED 
ON EXISTING CONTRIBUTING AGENCY RECORDS.— 
The chief State election official shall— 
(1) identify all individuals whose information 
is transmitted by a contributing agency pursu-
ant to section 1014 and who are eligible to be, 
but are not currently, registered to vote in that 
State; 
(2) promptly send each such individual writ-
ten notice, in addition to other means of notice 
established by this part, which shall not iden-
tify the contributing agency that transmitted 
the information but shall include— 
(A) an explanation that voter registration is 
voluntary, but if the individual does not decline 
registration, the individual will be registered to 
vote; 
(B) a statement offering the opportunity to 
decline voter registration through means con-
sistent with the requirements of this part; 
(C) in the case of a State in which affiliation 
or enrollment with a political party is required 
in order to participate in an election to select 
the party’s candidate in an election for Federal 
office, a statement offering the individual the 
opportunity to affiliate or enroll with a political 
party or to decline to affiliate or enroll with a 
political party, through means consistent with 
the requirements of this part; 
(D) the substantive qualifications of an elector 
in the State as listed in the mail voter registra-
tion application form for elections for Federal 
office prescribed pursuant to section 9 of the Na-
tional Voter Registration Act of 1993, the con-
sequences of false registration, and a statement 
that the individual should decline to register if 
the individual does not meet all those qualifica-
tions; 
(E) instructions for correcting any erroneous 
information; and

igible to register to vote in elections for Federal 
office in the State is promptly registered to vote 
not later than 45 days after the official sends 
the individual the written notice under para-
graph (2), unless, during the 30-day period 
which begins on the date the election official 
sends the individual such written notice, the in-
dividual 
declines 
registration 
in 
writing, 
through a communication made over the inter-
net, or by an officially logged telephone commu-
nication; and 
(4) send written notice to each such indi-
vidual, in addition to other means of notice es-
tablished by this part, of the individual’s voter 
registration status. 
(d) TREATMENT
OF
INDIVIDUALS
UNDER
18 
YEARS OF AGE.—A State may not refuse to treat 
an individual as an eligible individual for pur-
poses of this part on the grounds that the indi-
vidual is less than 18 years of age at the time a 
contributing agency receives information with 
respect to the individual, so long as the indi-
vidual is at least 16 years of age at such time. 
Nothing in the previous sentence may be con-

who is under 18 years of age at the time of an 
election for Federal office to vote in the election.

Subtitle E—Democracy Restoration 
SEC. 1401. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Democracy 
Restoration Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1402. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The right to vote is the most basic constitu-
tive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to 
vote reintegrates individuals with criminal con-
victions into free society, helping to enhance 
public safety. 
(2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution 
grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over 
Federal elections, an authority which has re-
peatedly been upheld by the Supreme Court. 
(3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness 
and equal protection require an equal oppor-
tunity for citizens of the United States to vote in 
Federal elections. The right to vote may not be 
abridged or denied by the United States or by 
any State on account of race, color, gender, or 
previous condition of servitude. The 13th, 14th, 
15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments to the 
Constitution empower Congress to enact meas-
ures to protect the right to vote in Federal elec-
tions. The 8th Amendment to the Constitution 
provides for no excessive bail to be required, nor 
excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual 
punishments inflicted. 
(4) There are 3 areas in which discrepancies in 
State laws regarding criminal convictions lead 
to unfairness in Federal elections: 
(A) The lack of a uniform standard for voting 
in Federal elections leads to an unfair disparity 
and unequal participation in Federal elections 
based solely on where a person lives. 
(B) Laws governing the restoration of voting 
rights after a criminal conviction vary through-
out the country, and persons in some States can 
easily regain their voting rights while in other 
States persons effectively lose their right to vote 
permanently. 
(C) State disenfranchisement laws dispropor-
tionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. 
(5) Two States (Maine and Vermont), the Dis-
trict of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico do not disenfranchise individuals 
with criminal convictions at all, but 48 States 
have laws that deny convicted individuals the 
right to vote while they are in prison. 
(6) In some States disenfranchisement results 
from varying State laws that restrict voting 
while individuals are under the supervision of 
the criminal justice system or after they have 
completed a criminal sentence. In 30 States, con-
victed individuals may not vote while they are 
on parole and 27 States disenfranchise individ-
uals on felony probation as well. In 11 States, a 
conviction can result in lifetime disenfranchise-
ment. 
(7) Several States deny the right to vote to in-
dividuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. 
(8) An estimated 5,200,000 citizens of the 
United States, or about 1 in 44 adults in the 
United States, currently cannot vote as a result 
of a felony conviction. Of the 5,200,000 citizens 
barred from voting, only 24 percent are in pris-
on. 
By 
contrast, 
75 
percent 
of 
the 
disenfranchised reside in their communities 
while on probation or parole or after having 
completed 
their 
sentences. 
Approximately 
2,200,000 citizens who have completed their sen-
tences remain disenfranchised due to restrictive 
State laws. In at least 6 States—Alabama, Flor-
ida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Vir-
ginia—more than 5 percent of the total voting- 
age population is disenfranchised. 
(9) In those States that disenfranchise individ-
uals post-sentence, the right to vote can be re-
gained in theory, but in practice this possibility 
is often granted in a non-uniform and poten-
tially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised 
individuals must either obtain a pardon or an 
order from the Governor or an action by the pa-
role or pardon board, depending on the offense 
and State. Individuals convicted of a Federal of-
fense often have additional barriers to regaining 
voting rights. 
(10) State disenfranchisement laws dispropor-
tionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. 
More than 6 percent of the African-American 
voting-age population, or 1,800,000 African 
Americans, are disenfranchised. Currently, 1 of 
every 16 voting-age African Americans are ren-
dered unable to vote because of felony dis-
enfranchisement, which is a rate more than 3.7 
times greater than non-African Americans. Over 
6 percent of African-American adults are 
disenfranchised whereas only 1.7 percent of 
non-African Americans are. In 7 States (Ala-
bama, 16 percent; Florida, 15 percent; Kentucky, 
15 percent; Mississippi, 16 percent; Tennessee, 21 
percent; Virginia, 16 percent; and Wyoming, 36 
percent), more than 1 in 7 African Americans 
are unable to vote because of prior convictions, 
twice the national average for African Ameri-
cans. 
(11) Latino citizens are disproportionately 
disenfranchised based upon their dispropor-
tionate representation in the criminal justice 
system. In recent years, Latinos have been im-
prisoned at 2.5 times the rate of Whites. More 
than 2 percent of the voting-age Latino popu-
lation, or 560,000 Latinos, are disenfranchised 
due to a felony conviction. In 34 states Latinos 
are disenfranchised at a higher rate than the 
general population. In 11 states 4 percent or 
more of Latino adults are disenfranchised due 
to a felony conviction (Alabama, 4 percent; Ari-
zona, 7 percent; Arkansas, 4 percent; Idaho, 4 
percent; Iowa, 4 percent; Kentucky, 6 percent; 
Minnesota, 4 percent; Mississippi, 5 percent; Ne-
braska, 6 percent; Tennessee, 11 percent, Wyo-
ming, 4 percent), twice the national average for 
Latinos. 
(12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been 
convicted of a criminal offense and who are liv-
ing and working in the community serves no 
compelling State interest and hinders their reha-
bilitation and reintegration into society. 
(13) State disenfranchisement laws can sup-
press electoral participation among eligible vot-
ers by discouraging voting among family and 
community members of disenfranchised persons. 
Future electoral participation by the children of 
disenfranchised parents may be impacted as 
well. 
(14) The United States is the only Western de-
mocracy that permits the permanent denial of 
voting rights for individuals with felony convic-
tions. 
SEC. 1403. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. 
The right of an individual who is a citizen of 
the United States to vote in any election for 
Federal office shall not be denied or abridged 
because that individual has been convicted of a 
criminal offense unless such individual is serv-
ing a felony sentence in a correctional institu-
tion or facility at the time of the election.

the date of an election for Federal office, the ag-
grieved person may, in a civil action, obtain de-
claratory or injunctive relief with respect to the 
violation. 
(3) EXCEPTION.—If the violation occurred 
within 30 days before the date of an election for 
Federal office, the aggrieved person need not 
provide notice to the chief election official of the 
State under paragraph (1) before bringing a civil 
action to obtain declaratory or injunctive relief 
with respect to the violation.

‘‘(II) The voting system shall provide the voter 
with an opportunity to correct any error on the 
paper ballot before the permanent voter-verified 
paper ballot is preserved in accordance with 
clause (ii). 
‘‘(III) The voting system shall not preserve the 
voter-verified paper ballots in any manner that 
makes it possible, at any time after the ballot 
has been cast, to associate a voter with the 
record of the voter’s vote without the voter’s 
consent. 
‘‘(ii) PRESERVATION AS OFFICIAL RECORD.—The 
individual, durable, voter-verified paper ballot 
used in accordance with clause (i) shall con-
stitute the official ballot and shall be preserved

COUNTING
REQUIREMENTS

used pursuant to clause (i) shall be suitable for 
a manual audit, and shall be counted by hand 
in any recount or audit conducted with respect 
to any election for Federal office. 
‘‘(II) In the event of any inconsistencies or 
irregularities between any electronic vote tallies 
and the vote tallies determined by counting by

rable, voter-verified paper ballots shall be the 
true and correct record of the votes cast. 
‘‘(iv) APPLICATION TO ALL BALLOTS.—The re-
quirements of this subparagraph shall apply to 
all ballots cast in elections for Federal office, in-
cluding ballots cast by absent uniformed services

electronic vote tallies and the vote tallies deter-
mined by counting by hand the individual, du-
rable, voter-verified paper ballots used pursuant

tion for Federal office; and 
‘‘(II) it is demonstrated by clear and con-
vincing evidence (as determined in accordance 
with the applicable standards in the jurisdiction 
involved) in any recount, audit, or contest of 
the result of the election that the paper ballots 
have been compromised (by damage or mischief 
or otherwise) and that a sufficient number of 
the ballots have been so compromised that the 
result of the election could be changed, 
the determination of the appropriate remedy 
with respect to the election shall be made in ac-
cordance with applicable State law, except that 
the electronic tally shall not be used as the ex-
clusive basis for determining the official cer-
tified result. 
‘‘(ii) RULE FOR CONSIDERATION OF BALLOTS AS-
SOCIATED WITH EACH VOTING MACHINE.—For pur-
poses of clause (i), only the paper ballots 
deemed compromised, if any, shall be considered 
in the calculation of whether or not the result of 
the election could be changed due to the com-
promised paper ballots.’’.

election at the polling place the opportunity to 
cast the vote using a blank pre-printed paper 
ballot which the individual may mark by hand 
and which is not produced by the direct record-
ing electronic voting machine or other such sys-
tem. The official shall provide the individual

mark the ballot, and shall ensure (to the great-
est extent practicable) that the waiting period

30 minutes or the average waiting period for an 
individual who does not agree to cast the vote 
using such a paper ballot under this clause. 
‘‘(II) TREATMENT OF BALLOT.—Any paper bal-
lot which is cast by an individual under this 
clause shall be counted and otherwise treated as

nently displayed at each polling place a notice 
that describes the obligation of the official to

chief State election official shall ensure that 
election officials at polling places in the State

an election official to fail to offer an individual 
the opportunity to cast a vote using a blank pre- 
printed paper ballot. 
‘‘(V) PERIOD OF APPLICABILITY.—The require-
ments of this clause apply only during the pe-
riod in which the delay is in effect under clause

automatically deposits the ballot into a privacy 
sleeve, subparagraph (A) shall apply to a voting 
system in the jurisdiction as if the reference in 
such subparagraph to ‘any election for Federal 
office held in 2022 or any succeeding year’ were 
a reference to ‘elections for Federal office occur-
ring held in 2024 or each succeeding year’, but

riod described in clause (i)(II), the individual 
provides the official with information to cure 
such discrepancy, either in person, by tele-
phone, or by electronic methods. 
‘‘(B) NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO CURE MISS-
ING SIGNATURE OR OTHER DEFECT.—If an indi-
vidual submits an absentee ballot without a sig-
nature or submits an absentee ballot with an-
other defect which, if left uncured, would cause 
the ballot to not be counted, the appropriate 
State or local election official, prior to making a 
final determination as to the validity of the bal-
lot, shall— 
‘‘(i) make a good faith effort to immediately 
notify the individual by mail, telephone, and (if 
available) text message and electronic mail 
that— 
‘‘(I) the ballot did not include a signature or 
has some other defect, and

missing signature or cure the other defect prior 
to the expiration of the 10-day period which be-
gins on the date the official notifies the indi-
vidual that the ballot did not include a signa-
ture or has some other defect, such ballot will 
not be counted; and

of the 10-day period described in clause (i)(II), 
the individual provides the official with the

ance of the ballot, as described in subsection (e).

or other document used by the State to verify 
the signatures of voters unless—

mination; 
‘‘(ii) each official who makes the determina-
tion has received training in procedures used to

subsection shall be construed— 
‘‘(A) to prohibit a State from rejecting a ballot 
attempted to be cast in an election for Federal 
office by an individual who is not eligible to 
vote in the election; or

for Federal office, the appropriate State or local 
election official shall transmit by mail an appli-
cation for an absentee ballot for the election to 
each individual who is registered to vote in the 
election, or, in the case of any State that does 
not register voters, all individuals who are in 
the State’s central voter file (or if the State does 
not keep a central voter file, all individuals who 
are eligible to vote in such election). 
‘‘(B) EXCEPTION
FOR
INDIVIDUALS
ALREADY 
RECEIVING APPLICATIONS AUTOMATICALLY.—Sub-
paragraph (A) does not apply with respect to an 
individual to whom the State is already required 
to transmit an application for an absentee ballot 
for the election because the individual exercised 
the option described in subparagraph (D) of 
paragraph (2) to treat an application for an ab-
sentee ballot in a previous election for Federal 
office in the State as an application for an ab-
sentee ballot in all subsequent elections for Fed-
eral office in the State. 
‘‘(C) EXCEPTION
FOR
STATES
TRANSMITTING 
BALLOTS WITHOUT APPLICATION.—Subparagraph 
(A) does not apply with respect to a State which 
transmits a ballot in an election for Federal of-
fice in the State to a voter prior to the date of 
the election without regard to whether or not 
the voter submitted an application for the ballot 
to the State. 
‘‘(D) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this 
paragraph may be construed to prohibit an indi-
vidual from submitting to the appropriate State 
or local election official an application for an 
absentee ballot in an election for Federal office, 
including through the methods described in 
paragraph (2). 
‘‘(2) OTHER METHODS FOR APPLYING FOR AB-
SENTEE BALLOT.—

methods as the State may establish for an indi-
vidual to apply for an absentee ballot, the State 
shall permit an individual—

ballot through the use of an automated tele-
phone-based system, subject to the same terms 
and conditions applicable under this paragraph 
to the services made available online. 
‘‘(B) TREATMENT
OF
WEBSITES.—The State 
shall be considered to meet the requirements of 
subparagraph (A)(i) if the website of the appro-
priate State or local election official allows an 
application for an absentee ballot to be com-
pleted and submitted online and if the website 
permits the individual— 
‘‘(i) to print the application so that the indi-
vidual may complete the application and return 
it to the official; or 
‘‘(ii) request that a paper copy of the applica-
tion be transmitted to the individual by mail or 
electronic mail so that the individual may com-
plete the application and return it to the offi-
cial. 
‘‘(C) ENSURING
DELIVERY
PRIOR
TO
ELEC-
TION.—If an individual who is eligible to vote in 
an election for Federal office submits an appli-
cation for an absentee ballot in the election, the 
appropriate State or local election official shall 
ensure that the ballot and relating voting mate-
rials are received by the individual prior to the 
date of the election so long as the individual’s 
application is received by the official not later 
than 5 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal public holidays) before the date of the 
election, except that nothing in this paragraph 
shall preclude a State or local jurisdiction from 
allowing for the acceptance and processing of 
absentee ballot applications submitted or re-
ceived after such required period. 
‘‘(D) APPLICATION
FOR
ALL
FUTURE
ELEC-
TIONS.—At the option of an individual, a State 
shall treat the individual’s application to vote 
by absentee ballot by mail in an election for 
Federal office as an application for an absentee 
ballot by mail in all subsequent Federal elec-
tions held in the State. 
‘‘(d) ACCESSIBILITY
FOR
INDIVIDUALS
WITH 
DISABILITIES.—The State shall ensure that all 
absentee ballot applications, absentee ballots, 
and related voting materials in elections for 
Federal office are accessible to individuals with 
disabilities in a manner that provides the same 
opportunity for access and participation (in-
cluding with privacy and independence) as for 
other voters. 
‘‘(e) UNIFORM DEADLINE FOR ACCEPTANCE OF 
MAILED BALLOTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A State may not refuse to 
accept or process a ballot submitted by an indi-
vidual by mail with respect to an election for

based on the number of ballots that the person 
has returned and no individual, group, or orga-
nization provides compensation on this basis;

SEC. 1904. ACCOMMODATIONS FOR VOTERS RE-
SIDING IN INDIAN LANDS. 
(a) ACCOMMODATIONS DESCRIBED.— 
(1) DESIGNATION OF BALLOT PICKUP AND COL-
LECTION LOCATIONS.—Given the widespread lack 
of residential mail delivery in Indian Country, 
an Indian Tribe may designate buildings as bal-
lot pickup and collection locations with respect 
to an election for Federal office at no cost to the 
Indian Tribe. An Indian Tribe may designate 
one building per precinct located within Indian 
lands. The applicable State or political subdivi-
sion shall collect ballots from those locations. 
The applicable State or political subdivision 
shall provide the Indian Tribe with accurate 
precinct maps for all precincts located within 
Indian lands 60 days before the election. 
(2) PROVISION OF MAIL-IN AND ABSENTEE BAL-
LOTS.—The State or political subdivision shall 
provide mail-in and absentee ballots with re-
spect to an election for Federal office to each in-
dividual who is registered to vote in the election 
who resides on Indian lands in the State or po-
litical subdivision involved without requiring a 
residential address or a mail-in or absentee bal-
lot request. 
(3) USE OF DESIGNATED BUILDING AS RESIDEN-
TIAL AND MAILING ADDRESS.—The address of a 
designated building that is a ballot pickup and 
collection location with respect to an election 
for Federal office may serve as the residential 
address and mailing address for voters living on 
Indian lands if the tribally designated building 
is in the same precinct as that voter. If there is 
no tribally designated building within a voter’s 
precinct, the voter may use another tribally des-
ignated building within the Indian lands where 
the voter is located. Voters using a tribally des-
ignated building outside of the voter’s precinct 
may use the tribally designated building as a 
mailing address and may separately designate 
the voter’s appropriate precinct through a de-
scription of the voter’s address, as specified in 
section 9428.4(a)(2) of title 11, Code of Federal 
Regulations. 
(4) LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY.—In the case of a

election voting assistance, and written trans-
lations of all voting materials in the language of 
the applicable minority group, as required by 
section 203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 
U.S.C. 10503), as amended by subsection (b).

available to all other voters in the State.

Subtitle A—Findings Reaffirming Commit-

Rights Act 
SEC. 2001. FINDINGS REAFFIRMING COMMITMENT 
OF CONGRESS TO RESTORE THE 
VOTING RIGHTS ACT. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) The right to vote for all Americans is a 
fundamental right guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution. 
(2) Federal, State, and local governments 
should protect the right to vote and promote 
voter participation across all demographics. 
(3) The Voting Rights Act has empowered the 
Department of Justice and Federal courts for 
nearly a half a century to block discriminatory 
voting practices before their implementation in 
States and localities with the most troubling his-
tories, ongoing records of racial discrimination, 
and demonstrations of lower participation rates 
for protected classes. 
(4) There continues to be an alarming move-
ment to erect barriers to make it more difficult 
for Americans to participate in our Nation’s 
democratic process. The Nation has witnessed 
unprecedented efforts to turn back the clock 
and enact suppressive laws that block access to 
the franchise for communities of color which 
have faced historic and continuing discrimina-
tion, as well as disabled, young, elderly, and 
low-income Americans. 
(5) The Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby 
County v. Holder (570 U.S. 529 (2013)), gutted 
decades-long Federal protections for commu-
nities of color and language-minority popu-
lations 
facing 
ongoing 
discrimination, 
emboldening States and local jurisdictions to 
pass voter suppression laws and implement pro-
cedures, like those requiring photo identifica-
tion, limiting early voting hours, eliminating 
same-day registration, purging voters from the 
rolls, and reducing the number of polling places. 
(6) Racial discrimination in voting is a clear 
and persistent problem. The actions of States 
and localities around the country post-Shelby 
County, including at least 10 findings by Fed-
eral courts of intentional discrimination, under-
scored the need for Congress to conduct inves-
tigatory and evidentiary hearings to determine 
the legislation necessary to restore the Voting 
Rights Act and combat continuing efforts in 
America that suppress the free exercise of the 
franchise in Black and other communities of 
color. 
(7) Evidence of discriminatory voting practice 
spans from decades ago through to the past sev-
eral election cycles. The 2018 midterm elections, 
for example, demonstrated ongoing discrimina-
tion in voting. 
(8) During the 116th Congress, congressional 
committees in the House of Representatives held 
numerous hearings, collecting substantial testi-
mony and other evidence which underscored the 
need to pass a restoration of the Voting Rights 
Act. 
(9) On December 6, 2019, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, which would restore 
and modernize the Voting Rights Act, in accord-
ance with language from the Shelby County de-
cision. Congress reaffirms that the barriers faced 
by too many voters across this Nation when try-
ing to cast their ballot necessitate reintroduction 
of many of the protections once afforded by the 
Voting Rights Act. 
(10) The 2020 primary and general elections 
provide further evidence that systemic voter dis-
crimination and intimidation continues to occur 
in communities of color across the country, mak-
ing it clear that full access to the franchise will 
not be achieved until Congress restores key pro-
visions of the Voting Rights Act. 
(11) As of late-February 2021, 43 States had 
introduced, prefiled, or carried over 253 bills to 
restrict voting access that, primarily, limit mail 
voting access, impose stricter voter ID require-
ments, slash voter registration opportunities, 
and/or enable more aggressive voter roll purges.

March 2, 2021 
(3) To enhance the integrity and security of 
our voting systems. 
(4) To ensure greater accountability for the 
administration of elections by States and local-
ities. 
(5) To restore protections for voters against 
practices in States and localities plagued by the 
persistence of voter disenfranchisement. 
(6) To ensure that Federal civil rights laws 
protect the rights of voters against discrimina-
tory and deceptive practices. 
Subtitle B—Findings Relating to Native 
American Voting Rights 
SEC. 2101. FINDINGS RELATING TO NATIVE AMER-
ICAN VOTING RIGHTS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The right to vote for all Americans is sa-
cred. Congress must fulfill the Federal Govern-
ment’s trust responsibility to protect and pro-
mote Native Americans’ exercise of their funda-
mental right to vote, including equal access to 
voter registration voting mechanisms and loca-
tions, and the ability to serve as election offi-
cials. 
(2) The Native American Voting Rights Coali-
tion’s four-State survey of voter discrimination 
(2016) and nine field hearings in Indian Country 
(2017–2018) revealed obstacles that Native Ameri-
cans must overcome, including a lack of acces-
sible and proximate registration and polling 
sites, nontraditional addresses for residents on 
Indian reservations, inadequate language assist-
ance for Tribal members, and voter identifica-
tion laws that discriminate against Native 
Americans. The Department of Justice and 
courts have recognized that some jurisdictions 
have been unresponsive to reasonable requests 
from federally recognized Indian Tribes for more 
accessible and proximate voter registration sites 
and in-person voting locations. 
(3) The 2018 midterm and 2020 general elec-
tions provide further evidence that systemic 
voter discrimination and intimidation continues 
to occur in communities of color and Tribal 
lands across the country, making it clear that 
democracy reform cannot be achieved until Con-
gress restores key provisions of the Voting 
Rights Act and passes additional protections. 
(4) Congress has broad, plenary authority to 
enact legislation to safeguard the voting rights 
of Native American voters. 
(5) Congress must conduct investigatory and 
evidentiary hearings to determine the necessary 
legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act and 
combat continuous efforts that suppress the 
voter franchise within Tribal lands, to include, 
but not to be limited to, the Native American 
Voting Rights Act (NAVRA) and the Voting 
Rights Advancement Act (VRAA). 
Subtitle C—Findings Relating to District of 
Columbia Statehood 
SEC. 2201. FINDINGS RELATING TO DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA STATEHOOD. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The 705,000 District of Columbia residents 
deserve voting representation in Congress and 
local self-government, which only statehood can 
provide. 
(2) The United States is the only democratic 
country that denies both voting representation 
in the national legislature and local self-govern-
ment to the residents of its Nation’s capital. 
(3) There are no constitutional, historical, fis-
cal, or economic reasons why the Americans 
who live in the District of Columbia should not 
be granted statehood. 
(4) Since the founding of the United States, 
the residents of the District of Columbia have 
always carried all of the obligations of citizen-
ship, including serving in all of the Nation’s 
wars and paying Federal taxes, but have been 
denied voting representation in Congress and 
freedom from congressional interference in pure-
ly local matters. 
(5) The District of Columbia pays more Fed-
eral taxes per capita than any State and more 
Federal taxes than 22 States. 
(6) The District of Columbia has a larger pop-
ulation than 2 States (Wyoming and Vermont), 
and 6 States have a population under one mil-
lion. 
(7) The District of Columbia has a larger 
budget than 12 States. 
(8) The Constitution of the United States gives 
Congress the authority to admit new States 
(clause 1, section 3, article IV) and reduce the 
size of the seat of the Government of the United 
States (clause 17, section 8, article I). All 37 new 
States have been admitted by an Act of Con-
gress, and Congress has previously reduced the 
size of the seat of the Government of the United 
States. 
(9) On June 26, 2020, by a vote of 232–180, the 
House of Representatives passed H.R. 51, the 
Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which would 
have admitted the State of Washington, Doug-
lass Commonwealth from the residential por-
tions of the District of Columbia and reduced 
the size of the seat of the Government of the 
United States to the United States Capitol, the 
White House, the United States Supreme Court, 
the National Mall, and the principal Federal 
monuments and buildings. 
Subtitle D—Territorial Voting Rights 
SEC. 2301. FINDINGS RELATING TO TERRITORIAL 
VOTING RIGHTS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The right to vote is one of the most power-
ful instruments residents of the territories of the 
United States have to ensure that their voices 
are heard. 
(2) These Americans have played an impor-
tant part in the American democracy for more 
than 120 years. 
(3) Political participation and the right to vote 
are among the highest concerns of territorial 
residents in part because they were not always 
afforded these rights. 
(4) Voter participation in the territories con-
sistently ranks higher than many communities 
on the mainland. 
(5) Territorial residents serve and die, on a per 
capita basis, at a higher rate in every United 
States war and conflict since WWI, as an ex-
pression of their commitment to American demo-
cratic principles and patriotism.

Subtitle E—Redistricting Reform 
SEC. 2400. SHORT TITLE; FINDING OF CONSTITU-
TIONAL AUTHORITY. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This subtitle may be cited 
as the ‘‘Redistricting Reform Act of 2021’’. 
(b) FINDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.— 
Congress finds that it has the authority to es-
tablish the terms and conditions States must fol-
low in carrying out congressional redistricting 
after an apportionment of Members of the House 
of Representatives because— 
(1) the authority granted to Congress under 
article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the 
United States gives Congress the power to enact 
laws governing the time, place, and manner of 
elections for Members of the House of Represent-
atives; and 
(2) the authority granted to Congress under 
section 5 of the fourteenth amendment to the 
Constitution gives Congress the power to enact 
laws to enforce section 2 of such amendment, 
which requires Representatives to be appor-
tioned among the several States according to 
their number. 
PART 1—REQUIREMENTS FOR 
CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING

acted into law by the independent redistricting 
commission established in the State, in accord-
ance with part 2; or

inserting: ‘‘in the manner provided by the Re-
districting Reform Act of 2021’’. 
(c) SPECIAL
RULE
FOR

screened through a process that excludes per-
sons with conflicts of interest from the pool of 
potential commissioners. 
(4) MULTI-PARTISAN
COMPOSITION.—Member-
ship on the commission represents those who are 
affiliated with the two political parties whose 
candidates received the most votes in the most

Agency with the assistance of a Temporary Re-
districting Advisory Commission, under law 
which was in effect for the most recent congres-
sional redistricting carried out in the State prior 
to the date of the enactment of this Act and 
which remains in effect continuously on and 
after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
SEC. 2402. BAN ON MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING. 
A State that has been redistricted in accord-
ance with this subtitle and a State described in 
section 2401(c) or section 2401(d) may not be re-
districted again until after the next apportion-
ment of Representatives under section 22(a) of 
the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to provide for the fif-
teenth and subsequent decennial censuses and 
to provide for an apportionment of Representa-
tives in Congress’’, approved June 18, 1929 (2 
U.S.C. 2a), unless a court requires the State to 
conduct such subsequent redistricting to comply 
with the Constitution of the United States, the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et 
seq.), the Constitution of the State, or the terms 
or conditions of this subtitle. 
SEC. 2403. CRITERIA FOR REDISTRICTING. 
(a) CRITERIA.—Under the redistricting plan of 
a State, there shall be established single-member 
congressional districts using the following cri-
teria as set forth in the following order of pri-
ority: 
(1) Districts shall comply with the United 
States Constitution, including the requirement 
that they equalize total population. 
(2) Districts shall comply with the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), in-
cluding by creating any districts where two or 
more politically cohesive groups protected by 
such Act are able to elect representatives of 
choice in coalition with one another, and all ap-
plicable Federal laws. 
(3) Districts shall be drawn, to the extent that 
the totality of the circumstances warrant, to en-
sure the practical ability of a group protected 
under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 
10301 et seq.) to participate in the political proc-
ess and to nominate candidates and to elect rep-
resentatives of choice is not diluted or dimin-
ished, regardless of whether or not such pro-
tected group constitutes a majority of a district’s 
citizen voting age population. 
(4) Districts shall respect communities of inter-
est, neighborhoods, and political subdivisions to 
the extent practicable and after compliance with 
the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (3). 
A community of interest is defined as an area 
with recognized similarities of interests, includ-
ing but not limited to ethnic, racial, economic, 
tribal, social, cultural, geographic or historic 
identities. The term communities of interest may, 
in certain circumstances, include political sub-
divisions such as counties, municipalities, tribal 
lands and reservations, or school districts, but 
shall not include common relationships with po-
litical parties or political candidates. 
(b) NO FAVORING OR DISFAVORING OF POLIT-
ICAL PARTIES.— 
(1) PROHIBITION.—The redistricting plan en-
acted by a State shall not, when considered on 
a Statewide basis, be drawn with the intent or 
the effect of unduly favoring or disfavoring any 
political party. 
(2) DETERMINATION OF EFFECT.— 
(A) TOTALITY
OF
CIRCUMSTANCES.—For pur-
poses of paragraph (1), the determination of 
whether a redistricting plan has the effect of 
unduly favoring or disfavoring a political party 
shall be based on the totality of circumstances, 
including evidence regarding the durability and 
severity of a plan’s partisan bias. 
(B) PLANS DEEMED TO HAVE EFFECT OF UN-
DULY
FAVORING
OR
DISFAVORING
A
POLITICAL 
PARTY.—Without limiting other ways in which a 
redistricting plan may be determined to have the 
effect of unduly favoring or disfavoring a polit-
ical party under the totality of circumstances 
under subparagraph (A), a redistricting plan 
shall be deemed to have the effect of unduly fa-
voring or disfavoring a political party if— 
(i) modeling based on relevant historical vot-
ing patterns shows that the plan is statistically 
likely to result in a partisan bias of more than 
one seat in States with 20 or fewer congressional 
districts or a partisan bias of more than 2 seats 
in States with more than 20 congressional dis-
tricts, as determined using quantitative meas-
ures of partisan fairness, which may include, 
but are not limited to, the seats-to-votes curve 
for an enacted plan, the efficiency gap, the dec-
lination, partisan asymmetry, and the mean-me-
dian difference, and 
(ii) alternative plans, which may include, but 
are not limited to, those generated by redis-
tricting algorithms, exist that could have com-
plied with the requirements of law and not been 
in violation of paragraph (1). 
(3) DETERMINATION OF INTENT.—For purposes 
of paragraph (A), a rebuttable presumption 
shall exist that a redistricting plan enacted by 
the legislature of a State was not enacted with 
the intent of unduly favoring or disfavoring a 
political party if the plan was enacted with the 
support of at least a third of the members of the 
second largest political party in each house of 
the legislature. 
(4) NO
VIOLATION
BASED
ON
CERTAIN
CRI-
TERIA.—No redistricting plan shall be found to 
be in violation of paragraph (1) because of par-
tisan bias attributable to the application of the 
criteria set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of 
subsection (a), unless one or more alternative 
plans could have complied with such para-
graphs without having the effect of unduly fa-
voring or disfavoring a political party.

any election. 
‘‘(B) The failure of the registrant to respond 
to any notice sent under section 8(d), unless the

a registrant. 
‘‘(b) NOTICE AFTER REMOVAL.— 
‘‘(1) NOTICE TO INDIVIDUAL REMOVED.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 48 hours 
after a State removes the name of a registrant 
from the official list of eligible voters for any 
reason (other than the death of the registrant), 
the State shall send notice of the removal to the 
former registrant, and shall include in the no-
tice the grounds for the removal and informa-
tion on how the former registrant may contest 
the removal or be reinstated, including a tele-
phone number for the appropriate election offi-
cial. 
‘‘(B) EXCEPTIONS.—Subparagraph (A) does 
not apply in the case of a registrant— 
‘‘(i) who sends written confirmation to the 
State that the registrant is no longer eligible to 
vote in the registrar’s jurisdiction in which the 
registrant was registered; or 
‘‘(ii) who is removed from the official list of el-
igible voters by reason of the death of the reg-
istrant. 
‘‘(2) PUBLIC NOTICE.—Not later than 48 hours

the names of ineligible voters from the official 
list of eligible voters (as described in section 
8(a)(4)), the State shall disseminate a public no-
tice through such methods as may be reasonable 
to reach the general public (including by pub-
lishing the notice in a newspaper of wide cir-
culation or posting the notice on the websites of 
the appropriate election officials) that list main-
tenance is taking place and that registrants 
should check their registration status to ensure 
no errors or mistakes have been made. The State

sonably convenient and accessible to voters with 
disabilities, including voters who have low vi-
sion or are blind.’’.

TIES FOR VOTING. 
Nothing in this title or the amendments made

State from enacting any law which provides 
greater opportunities for individuals to register 
to vote and to vote in elections for Federal office 
than are provided by this title and the amend-
ments made by this title. 
Subtitle H—Residence of Incarcerated 
Individuals 
SEC. 2701. RESIDENCE OF INCARCERATED INDI-
VIDUALS. 
Section 141 of title 13, United States Code, is 
amended 
(1) by redesignating subsection (g) as sub-
section (h); and 
(2) by inserting after subsection (f) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(g)(1) Effective beginning with the 2020 de-
cennial census of population, in taking any tab-
ulation of total population by States under sub-
section (a) for purposes of the apportionment of 
Representatives in Congress among the several 
States, the Secretary shall, with respect to an 
individual incarcerated in a State, Federal, 
county, or municipal correctional center as of 
the date on which such census is taken, at-
tribute such individual to such individual’s last 
place of residence before incarceration. 
‘‘(2) In carrying out this subsection, the Sec-
retary shall consult with each State department 
of corrections to collect the information nec-
essary to make the determination required under 
paragraph (1).’’. 
Subtitle I—Findings Relating to Youth Voting 
SEC. 2801. FINDINGS RELATING TO YOUTH VOT-
ING. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The right to vote is a fundamental right of 
citizens of the United States. 
(2) The twenty-sixth amendment of the United 
States Constitution guarantees that ‘‘The right 
of citizens of the United States, who are eight-
een years of age or older, to vote shall not be de-
nied or abridged by the United States or by any 
State on account of age.’’. 
(3) The twenty-sixth amendment of the United 
States Constitution grants Congress the power 
to enforce the amendment by appropriate legis-
lation. 
(4) The language of the twenty-sixth amend-
ment closely mirrors that of the fifteenth amend-
ment and the nineteenth amendment. Like those 
amendments, the twenty-sixth amendment not 
only prohibits denial of the right to vote but 
also prohibits any actions that abridge the right 
to vote. 
(5) Youth voter suppression undercuts partici-
pation in our democracy by introducing arduous 
obstacles to new voters and discouraging a cul-
ture of democratic engagement. 
(6) Voting is habit forming, and allowing 
youth voters unobstructed access to voting en-
sures that more Americans will start a life-long 
habit of voting as soon as possible. 
(7) Youth voter suppression is a clear, per-
sistent, and growing problem. The actions of 
States and political subdivisions resulting in at 
least four findings of twenty-sixth amendment 
violations as well as pending litigation dem-
onstrate the need for Congress to take action to 
enforce the twenty-sixth amendment. 
(8) In League of Women Voters of Florida, 
Inc. v. Detzner (2018), the United States District 
Court in the Northern District of Florida found 
that the Secretary of State’s actions that pre-
vented in-person early voting sites from being 
located on university property revealed a stark 
pattern 
of 
discrimination 
that 
was 
unexplainable on grounds other than age and 
thus violated university students’ twenty-sixth 
Amendment rights. 
(9) In 2019, Michigan agreed to a settlement to 
enhance college-age voters’ access after a twen-
ty-sixth amendment challenge was filed in fed-
eral court. The challenge prompted the removal 
of a Michigan voting law which required first 
time voters who registered by mail or through a 
third-party voter registration drive to vote in 
person for the first time, as well as the removal 
of another law which required the address listed 
on a voter’s driver license to match the address 
listed on their voter registration card. 
(10) Youth voter suppression tactics are often 
linked to other tactics aimed at minority voters. 
For example, students at Prairie View A&M 
University (PVAMU), a historically black uni-
versity in Texas, have been the targets of voter 
suppression tactics for decades. Before the 2018 
election, PVAMU students sued Waller County 
on the basis of both racial and age discrimina-
tion over the County’s failure to ensure equal 
early voting opportunities for students, spurring 
the County to reverse course and expand early 
voting access for students. 
(11) The more than 25 million United States 
citizens ages 18-24 deserve equal opportunity to 
participate in the electoral process as guaran-
teed by the twenty-sixth amendment. 
Subtitle J—Severability 
SEC. 2901. SEVERABILITY. 
If any provision of this title or amendment 
made by this title, or the application of a provi-
sion or amendment to any person or cir-
cumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the 
remainder of this title and amendments made by 
this title, and the application of the provisions 
and amendment to any person or circumstance, 
shall not be affected by the holding.

FINDINGS 
RELATING 
TO 
ILLICIT 
MONEY UNDERMINING OUR DEMOC-
RACY. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Criminals, terrorists, and corrupt govern-
ment officials frequently abuse anonymously 
held Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), also 
known as ‘‘shell companies,’’ to hide, move, and 
launder the dirty money derived from illicit ac-
tivities such as trafficking, bribery, exploitation, 
and embezzlement. Ownership and control of 
the finances that run through shell companies 
are obscured to regulators and law enforcement 
because little information is required and col-
lected when establishing these entities. 
(2) The public release of the ‘‘Panama Pa-
pers’’ in 2016 and the ‘‘Paradise Papers’’ in 2017 
revealed that these shell companies often pur-
chase and sell United States real estate. United 
States anti-money laundering laws do not apply 
to cash transactions involving real estate effec-
tively concealing the beneficiaries and trans-
actions from regulators and law enforcement. 
(3) Since the Supreme Court’s decisions in 
Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 
558 U.S. 310 (2010), millions of dollars have 
flowed into super PACs through LLCs whose 
funders are anonymous or intentionally ob-
scured. Criminal investigations have uncovered 
LLCs that were used to hide illegal campaign 
contributions from foreign criminal fugitives, to 
advance 
international 
influence-buying 
schemes, and to conceal contributions from do-
nors who were already under investigation for 
bribery and racketeering. Voters have no way to 
know the true sources of the money being routed 
through these LLCs to influence elections, in-
cluding whether any of the funds come from for-
eign or other illicit sources. 
(4) Congress should curb the use of anony-
mous shell companies for illicit purposes by re-
quiring United States companies to disclose their 
beneficial owners, strengthening anti-money 
laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws. 
(5) Congress should examine the money laun-
dering and terrorist financing risks in the real 
estate market, including the role of anonymous 
parties, and review legislation to address any 
vulnerabilities identified in this sector. 
(6) Congress should examine the methods by 
which corruption flourishes and the means to

REGARDING
TRANSFERS 
AMONG AFFILIATES.— 
‘‘(A) SPECIAL RULE.—A transfer of an amount 
by one covered organization to another covered

covered organization is equal to or greater than 
$50,000. 
‘‘(B) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF CERTAIN 
PAYMENTS
AMONG
AFFILIATES.—In determining

the transfer consists of funds attributable to 
dues, fees, or assessments which are paid by in-
dividuals on a regular, periodic basis in accord-
ance with a per-individual calculation which is

fees, or assessments and shall not be attributed 
to the covered organization. 
‘‘(C) DESCRIPTION OF TRANSFERS BETWEEN AF-
FILIATES.—A transfer of amounts from one cov-
ered organization to another covered organiza-
tion shall be treated as a transfer between affili-
ates if— 
‘‘(i) one of the organizations is an affiliate of 
the other organization; or 
‘‘(ii) each of the organizations is an affiliate 
of the same organization, 
except that the transfer shall not be treated as 
a transfer between affiliates if one of the orga-
nizations is established for the purpose of mak-
ing campaign-related disbursements. 
‘‘(D) DETERMINATION OF AFFILIATE STATUS.— 
For purposes of subparagraph (C), a covered or-
ganization is an affiliate of another covered or-
ganization if— 
‘‘(i) the governing instrument of the organiza-
tion requires it to be bound by decisions of the 
other organization; 
‘‘(ii) the governing board of the organization

facially or as-applied, the constitutionality or 
lawfulness of any provision of this Act or of

claratory or injunctive relief to challenge the 
constitutionality of a provision, the party filing

‘‘(3) It shall be the duty of the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia and

bia Circuit to advance on the docket and to ex-
pedite to the greatest possible extent the disposi-
tion of the action and appeal.

counterclaim, cross-claim, affirmative defense, 
or any other pleading or motion is filed chal-
lenging, whether facially or as-applied, the con-
stitutionality or lawfulness of this Act or of

Subtitle C—Strengthening Oversight of 
Online Political Advertising 
SEC. 4201. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Honest Ads 
Act’’. 
SEC. 4202. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this subtitle is to enhance the 
integrity of American democracy and national 
security by improving disclosure requirements 
for online political advertisements in order to 
uphold the Supreme Court’s well-established 
standard that the electorate bears the right to be 
fully informed. 
SEC. 4203. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Di-
rector of National Intelligence published a re-
port titled ‘‘Assessing Russian Activities and In-
tentions in Recent U.S. Elections’’, noting that 
‘‘Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an 
influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US 
presidential election * * *’’. Moscow’s influence 
campaign followed a Russian messaging strat-
egy that blends covert intelligence operation— 
such as cyber activity—with overt efforts by 
Russian 
Government 
agencies, 
state-funded 
media, third-party intermediaries, and paid so-
cial media users or ‘‘trolls’’. 
(2) On November 24, 2016, The Washington 
Post reported findings from 2 teams of inde-
pendent researchers that concluded Russians 
‘‘exploited American-made technology platforms 
to attack U.S. democracy at a particularly vul-
nerable moment * * * as part of a broadly effec-
tive strategy of sowing distrust in U.S. democ-
racy and its leaders.’’. 
(3) Findings from a 2017 study on the manipu-
lation of public opinion through social media 
conducted by the Computational Propaganda 
Research Project at the Oxford Internet Insti-
tute found that the Kremlin is using pro-Rus-
sian bots to manipulate public discourse to a 
highly targeted audience. With a sample of 
nearly 1,300,000 tweets, researchers found that 
in the 2016 election’s 3 decisive States, propa-
ganda constituted 40 percent of the sampled 
election-related tweets that went to Pennsylva-
nians, 34 percent to Michigan voters, and 30 
percent to those in Wisconsin. In other swing 
States, the figure reached 42 percent in Mis-
souri, 41 percent in Florida, 40 percent in North 
Carolina, 38 percent in Colorado, and 35 percent 
in Ohio. 
(4) On September 6, 2017, the Nation’s largest 
social media platform disclosed that between 
June 2015 and May 2017, Russian entities pur-
chased $100,000 in political advertisements, pub-
lishing roughly 3,000 ads linked to fake ac-
counts associated with the Internet Research 
Agency, a pro-Kremlin organization. According 
to the company, the ads purchased focused ‘‘on 
amplifying divisive social and political messages 
* * *’’. 
(5) In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform 
Act became law, establishing disclosure require-
ments for political advertisements distributed 
from a television or radio broadcast station or 
provider of cable or satellite television. In 2003, 
the Supreme Court upheld regulations on elec-
tioneering communications established under 
the Act, noting that such requirements ‘‘provide 
the electorate with information and insure that 
the voters are fully informed about the person or 
group who is speaking.’’. 
(6) According to a study from Borrell Associ-
ates, in 2016, $1,415,000,000 was spent on online 
advertising, more than quadruple the amount in 
2012. 
(7) The reach of a few large internet plat-
forms—larger than any broadcast, satellite, or 
cable provider—has greatly facilitated the scope 
and effectiveness of disinformation campaigns. 
For instance, the largest platform has over 
210,000,000 Americans users—over 160,000,000 of 
them on a daily basis. By contrast, the largest 
cable television provider has 22,430,000 sub-
scribers, while the largest satellite television 
provider has 21,000,000 subscribers. And the 
most-watched television broadcast in United 
States history had 118,000,000 viewers. 
(8) The public nature of broadcast television, 
radio, and satellite ensures a level of publicity 
for any political advertisement. These commu-
nications are accessible to the press, fact-check-
ers, and political opponents; this creates strong 
disincentives for a candidate to disseminate ma-
terially false, inflammatory, or contradictory 
messages to the public. Social media platforms, 
in contrast, can target portions of the electorate 
with direct, ephemeral advertisements often on 
the basis of private information the platform has 
on individuals, enabling political advertisements 
that are contradictory, racially or socially in-
flammatory, or materially false. 
(9) According to comScore, 2 companies own 8 
of the 10 most popular smart phone applications

March 2, 2021 
as of June 2017, including the most popular so-
cial media and email services—which deliver in-
formation and news to users without requiring 
proactivity by the user. Those same 2 companies 
accounted for 99 percent of revenue growth from 
digital advertising in 2016, including 77 percent 
of gross spending. 79 percent of online Ameri-
cans—representing 68 percent of all Americans— 
use the single largest social network, while 66 
percent of these users are most likely to get their 
news from that site. 
(10) In its 2006 rulemaking, the Federal Elec-
tion Commission noted that only 18 percent of 
all Americans cited the internet as their leading 
source of news about the 2004 Presidential elec-
tion; by contrast, the Pew Research Center 
found that 65 percent of Americans identified an 
internet-based source as their leading source of 
information for the 2016 election. 
(11) The Federal Election Commission, the 
independent Federal agency charged with pro-
tecting the integrity of the Federal campaign fi-
nance process by providing transparency and 
administering campaign finance laws, has failed 
to take action to address online political adver-
tisements. 
(12) In testimony before the Senate Select 
Committee 
on 
Intelligence 
titled, 
‘‘Disinformation: A Primer in Russian Active 
Measures and Influence Campaigns’’, multiple 
expert 
witnesses 
testified 
that 
while 
the 
disinformation tactics of foreign adversaries 
have not necessarily changed, social media serv-
ices now provide ‘‘platform[s] practically pur-
pose-built for active measures[.]’’ Similarly, as 
Gen. Keith B. Alexander (RET.), the former Di-
rector of the National Security Agency, testified, 
during the Cold War ‘‘if the Soviet Union 
sought to manipulate information flow, it would 
have to do so principally through its own propa-
ganda outlets or through active measures that 
would generate specific news: planting of leaf-
lets, inciting of violence, creation of other false 
materials and narratives. But the news itself 
was hard to manipulate because it would have 
required actual control of the organs of media, 
which took long-term efforts to penetrate. 
Today, however, because the clear majority of 
the 
information 
on 
social 
media 
sites 
is 
uncurated and there is a rapid proliferation of 
information sources and other sites that can re-
inforce information, there is an increasing like-
lihood that the information available to average 
consumers may be inaccurate (whether inten-
tionally or otherwise) and may be more easily 
manipulable than in prior eras.’’. 
(13) Current regulations on political advertise-
ments do not provide sufficient transparency to 
uphold the public’s right to be fully informed 
about political advertisements made online. 
SEC. 4204. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the dramatic increase in digital political 
advertisements, and the growing centrality of 
online platforms in the lives of Americans, re-
quires the Congress and the Federal Election 
Commission to take meaningful action to ensure 
that laws and regulations provide the account-
ability and transparency that is fundamental to 
our democracy; 
(2) free and fair elections require both trans-
parency and accountability which give the pub-
lic a right to know the true sources of funding 
for political advertisements in order to make in-
formed political choices and hold elected offi-
cials accountable; and 
(3) transparency of funding for political ad-
vertisements is essential to enforce other cam-
paign finance laws, including the prohibition on 
campaign spending by foreign nationals. 
SEC. 4205. EXPANSION OF DEFINITION OF PUBLIC

tion or to deceive a voter into voting for or

utes in length, interspersed within the audio at 
intervals of not greater than 2 minutes each.

spot coverage of bona fide news events, if the 
broadcast clearly acknowledges through content 
or a disclosure, in a manner that can be easily 
heard or read by the average listener or viewer, 
that there are questions about the authenticity 
of the materially deceptive audio or visual 
media. 
‘‘(2) A radio or television broadcasting station, 
including a cable or satellite television operator, 
programmer, or producer, when it is paid to 
broadcast materially deceptive audio or visual 
media.

lished newspaper, magazine, or other periodical 
of general circulation, including an internet or 
electronic publication, that routinely carries 
news and commentary of general interest, and

ual media prohibited by this section, if the pub-
lication clearly states that the materially decep-
tive audio or visual media does not accurately 
represent the speech or conduct of the can-
didate. 
‘‘(4) Materially deceptive audio or visual 
media that constitutes satire or parody. 
‘‘(d) CIVIL ACTION.— 
‘‘(1) INJUNCTIVE
OR
OTHER
EQUITABLE
RE-
LIEF.—A candidate for elective office whose 
voice or likeness appears in a materially decep-
tive audio or visual media distributed in viola-
tion of this section may seek injunctive or other

tion. An action under this paragraph shall be

whose voice or likeness appears in a materially 
deceptive audio or visual media distributed in 
violation of this section may bring an action for 
general or special damages against the person,

able attorney’s fees and costs. This paragraph 
shall not be construed to limit or preclude a 
plaintiff from securing or recovering any other 
available remedy. 
‘‘(3) BURDEN OF PROOF.—In any civil action 
alleging a violation of this section, the plaintiff 
shall bear the burden of establishing the viola-
tion through clear and convincing evidence.

shall not be construed to alter or negate any 
rights, obligations, or immunities of an inter-
active service provider under section 230 of title 
47, United States Code. 
‘‘(f) MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE AUDIO OR VISUAL 
MEDIA DEFINED.—In this section, the term ‘ma-
terially deceptive audio or visual media’ means 
an image or an audio or video recording of a 
candidate’s appearance, speech, or conduct that 
has been intentionally manipulated in a manner 
such that both of the following conditions are 
met:

would falsely appear to a reasonable person to 
be authentic.

would cause a reasonable person to have a fun-
damentally different understanding or impres-
sion of the expressive content of the image or 
audio or video recording than that person would 
have if the person were hearing or seeing the 
unaltered, original version of the image or audio 
or video recording.’’.

poses of an action for defamation, a violation of 
section 325 of the Federal Election Campaign

Subtitle A—Findings Relating to Citizens 
United Decision 
SEC. 5001. FINDINGS RELATING TO CITIZENS 
UNITED DECISION. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The American Republic was founded on 
the principle that all people are created equal, 
with rights and responsibilities as citizens to 
vote, be represented, speak, debate, and partici-
pate in self-government on equal terms regard-
less of wealth. To secure these rights and re-
sponsibilities, our Constitution not only protects 
the equal rights of all Americans but also pro-
vides checks and balances to prevent corruption 
and prevent concentrated power and wealth 
from undermining effective self-government. 
(2) The Founders designed the First Amend-
ment to help prevent tyranny by ensuring that 
the people have the tools they need to ensure 
self-government and to keep their elected leaders 
responsive to the public. The Amendment thus 
guarantees the right of everyone to speak, to pe-
tition the government for redress, to assemble to-
gether, and for a free press. If only the wealthi-
est individuals can participate meaningfully in 
our democracy, then these First Amendment 
principles become an illusion. 
(3) Campaign finance laws promote these First 
Amendment interests. They increase robust de-
bate from diverse voices, enhance the respon-
siveness of elected officeholders, and help pre-
vent corruption. They do not censor anyone’s 
speech but simply ensure that no one’s speech is 
drowned out. The Supreme Court has failed to 
recognize 
that 
these 
laws 
are 
essential, 
proactive rules that help guarantee true demo-
cratic self-government. 
(4) The Supreme Court’s decisions in Citizens 
United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 
310 (2010) and McCutcheon v. FEC, 572 U.S. 185 
(2014), as well as other court decisions, erro-
neously invalidated even-handed rules about 
the spending of money in local, State, and Fed-
eral elections. These rules do not prevent any-
one from speaking their mind, much less pick 
winners and losers of political debates. Al-
though the Court has upheld other content-neu-
tral laws like these, it has failed to apply to 
same logic to campaign finance laws. These 
flawed decisions have empowered large corpora-
tions, extremely wealthy individuals, and spe-
cial interests to dominate election spending, cor-
rupt our politics, and degrade our democracy 
through tidal waves of unlimited and anony-
mous spending. These decisions also stand in 
contrast to a long history of efforts by Congress 
and the States to regulate money in politics to 
protect democracy, and they illustrate a trou-
bling deregulatory trend in campaign finance- 
related court decisions. Additionally, an un-
known amount of foreign money continues to be 
spent in our political system as subsidiaries of 
foreign-based corporations and hostile foreign 
actors sometimes connected to nation-states 
work to influence our elections. 
(5) The Supreme Court’s misinterpretation of 
the Constitution to empower monied interests at 
the expense of the American people in elections 
has seriously eroded over 100 years of congres-
sional action to promote fairness and protect 
elections from the toxic influence of money. 
(6) In 1907, Congress passed the Tillman Act 
in response to the concentration of corporate 
power in the post-Civil War Gilded Age. The Act 
prohibited corporations from making contribu-
tions in connection with Federal elections, aim-
ing ‘‘not merely to prevent the subversion of the 
integrity of the electoral process [but] * * * to 
sustain the active, alert responsibility of the in-
dividual citizen in a democracy for the wise con-
duct of government’’. 
(7) By 1910, Congress began passing disclosure 
requirements and campaign expenditure limits, 
and dozens of States passed corrupt practices 
Acts to prohibit corporate spending in elections. 
States also enacted campaign spending limits, 
and some States limited the amount that people 
could contribute to campaigns. 
(8) In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited 
corporations and unions from making campaign 
contributions or other expenditures to influence 
elections. In 1962, a Presidential commission on 
election spending recommended spending limits 
and incentives to increase small contributions 
from more people. 
(9) The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 
(FECA), as amended in 1974, required disclosure 
of contributions and expenditures, imposed con-
tribution and expenditure limits for individuals 
and groups, set spending limits for campaigns, 
candidates, and groups, implemented a public 
funding system for Presidential campaigns, and 
created the Federal Election Commission to 
oversee and enforce the new rules. 
(10) In the wake of Citizens United and other 
damaging Federal court decisions, Americans 
have witnessed an explosion of outside spending 
in elections. Outside spending increased more 
than 700 percent between the 2008 and 2020 
Presidential election years. Spending by outside 
groups nearly doubled again from 2016 to 2020 
with super PACs, tax-exempt groups, and others 
spending more than $3,000,000,000. And as polit-
ical entities adapt to a post-Citizens United, 
post-McCutcheon landscape, these trends are 
getting worse, as evidenced by the record-setting 
2020 
elections 
which 
cost 
more 
than 
$14,000,000,000 in total. 
(11) Since the landmark Citizens United deci-
sion, 21 States and more than 800 municipalities, 
including large cities like New York, Los Ange-
les, Chicago, and Philadelphia, have gone on 
record supporting a constitutional amendment. 
Transcending political leanings and geographic 
location, voters in States and municipalities 
across the country that have placed amendment 
questions on the ballot have routinely supported 
these initiatives by considerably large margins. 
(12) The Court has tied the hands of Congress 
and the States, severely restricting them from 
setting reasonable limits on campaign spending. 
For example, the Court has held that only the 
Government’s interest in preventing quid pro 
quo corruption, like bribery, or the appearance 
of such corruption, can justify limits on cam-
paign contributions. More broadly, the Court 
has severely curtailed attempts to reduce the 
ability of the Nation’s wealthiest and most pow-
erful to skew our democracy in their favor by 
buying outsized influence in our elections. Be-
cause this distortion of the Constitution has pre-
vented other critical regulation or reform of the 
way we finance elections in America, a constitu-
tional amendment is needed to achieve a democ-
racy for all the people. 
(13) The torrent of money flowing into our po-
litical system has a profound effect on the demo-
cratic process for everyday Americans, whose 
voices and policy preferences are increasingly 
being drowned out by those of wealthy special 
interests. The more campaign cash from wealthy 
special interests can flood our elections, the 
more policies that favor those interests are re-
flected in the national political agenda. When it 
comes to policy preferences, our Nation’s 
wealthiest tend to have fundamentally different 
views than do average Americans when it comes 
to issues ranging from unemployment benefits to 
the minimum wage to health care coverage. 
(14) At the same time millions of Americans 
have signed petitions, marched, called their 
Members of Congress, written letters to the edi-
tor, and otherwise demonstrated their public 
support for a constitutional amendment to over-
turn Citizens United that will allow Congress to 
reign in the outsized influence of unchecked 
money in politics. Dozens of organizations, rep-
resenting tens of millions of individuals, have 
come together in a shared strategy of supporting 
such an amendment. 
(15) In order to protect the integrity of democ-
racy and the electoral process and to ensure po-
litical equality for all, the Constitution should 
be amended so that Congress and the States may 
regulate and set limits on the raising and spend-
ing of money to influence elections and may dis-
tinguish between natural persons and artificial 
entities, like corporations, that are created by 
law, including by prohibiting such artificial en-
tities from spending money to influence elec-
tions.

Campaign Act of 1971 (as added by section 5111), 
the amounts remaining in the Fund will be suf-
ficient to make payments to States under this 
part in the amounts provided under this sub-
section; and 
(ii) submit a report to Congress describing the 
results of the audit. 
(B) REDUCTIONS IN AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS.— 
(i) AUTOMATIC
REDUCTION
ON
PRO
RATA 
BASIS.—If, on the basis of the audit described in 
subparagraph (A), the Commission determines 
that the amount anticipated to be available in 
the Fund with respect to an election cycle in-
volved is not, or may not be, sufficient to make 
payments to States under this part in the full 
amount provided under this subsection, the 
Commission shall reduce each amount which 
would otherwise be paid to a State under this 
subsection by such pro rata amount as may be 
necessary to ensure that the aggregate amount 
of payments anticipated to be made with respect 
to the cycle will not exceed the amount antici-
pated to be available for such payments in the 
Fund with respect to such cycle. 
(ii) RESTORATION OF REDUCTIONS IN CASE OF 
AVAILABILITY
OF
SUFFICIENT
FUNDS
DURING 
ELECTION
CYCLE.—If, 
after 
reducing 
the 
amounts paid to States with respect to an elec-
tion cycle under clause (i), the Commission de-
termines that there are sufficient amounts in the 
Fund to restore the amount by which such pay-
ments were reduced (or any portion thereof), to 
the extent that such amounts are available, the 
Commission may make a payment on a pro rata 
basis to each such State with respect to the cycle 
in the amount by which such State’s payments 
were reduced under clause (i) (or any portion 
thereof, as the case may be). 
(iii) NO
USE
OF
AMOUNTS
FROM
OTHER 
SOURCES.—In any case in which the Commission 
determines that there are insufficient moneys in 
the Fund to make payments to States under this 
part, moneys shall not be made available from 
any other source for the purpose of making such 
payments. 
(4) CAP ON AMOUNT OF PAYMENT.—The aggre-
gate amount of payments made to any State 
with respect to any program operation period 
may not exceed $10,000,000. If the State deter-
mines that the maximum payment amount under 
this paragraph with respect to the program op-
eration period involved is not, or may not be, 
sufficient to cover the reasonable costs incurred 
by the State in operating the program under this 
part for such period, the State shall reduce the 
amount of the voucher provided to each quali-
fied individual by such pro rata amount as may 
be necessary to ensure that the reasonable costs 
incurred by the State in operating the program 
will not exceed the amount paid to the State 
with respect to such period.

tions: 
‘‘(A) Not later than 2 weeks after receiving the

tribution), the candidate may return an amount

Subtitle D—Personal Use Services as 
Authorized Campaign Expenditures 
SEC. 5301. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This subtitle may be cited 
as the ‘‘Help America Run Act’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) Everyday Americans experience barriers to 
entry before they can consider running for of-
fice to serve their communities. 
(2) Current law states that campaign funds 
cannot be spent on everyday expenses that 
would exist whether or not a candidate were 
running for office, like childcare and food. 
While the law seems neutral, its actual effect is 
to privilege the independently wealthy who 
want to run, because given the demands of run-
ning for office, candidates who must work to 
pay for childcare or to afford health insurance 
are effectively being left out of the process, even 
if they have sufficient support to mount a viable 
campaign. 
(3) Thus current practice favors those prospec-
tive candidates who do not need to rely on a 
regular paycheck to make ends meet. The con-
sequence is that everyday Americans who have 
firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable 
childcare, a safety net, or great public schools 
are less likely to get a seat at the table. This 
governance by the few is antithetical to the 
democratic experiment, but most importantly, 
when lawmakers do not share the concerns of 
everyday Americans, their policies reflect that. 
(4) These circumstances have contributed to a 
Congress that does not always reflect everyday 
Americans. The New York Times reported in 
2019 that fewer than 5 percent of representatives 
cite blue-collar or service jobs in their biog-
raphies. A 2015 survey by the Center for Respon-
sive Politics showed that the median net worth 
of lawmakers was just over $1 million in 2013, or 
18 times the wealth of the typical American 
household. 
(5) These circumstances have also contributed 
to a governing body that does not reflect the na-
tion it serves. For instance, women are 51 per-
cent of the American population. Yet even with 
a record number of women serving in the One 
Hundred Sixteenth Congress, the Pew Research 
Center notes that more than three out of four 
Members of this Congress are male. The Center 
for American Women And Politics found that 
one third of women legislators surveyed had 
been actively discouraged from running for of-
fice, often by political professionals. This type 
of discouragement, combined with the prohibi-
tions on using campaign funds for domestic 
needs like childcare, burdens that still fall dis-
proportionately on American women, particu-
larly disadvantages working mothers. These 
barriers may explain why only 10 women in his-
tory have given birth while serving in Congress, 
in spite of the prevalence of working parents in 
other professions. Yet working mothers and fa-
thers are best positioned to create policy that re-
flects the lived experience of most Americans. 
(6) Working mothers, those caring for their el-
derly parents, and young professionals who rely 
on their jobs for health insurance should have 
the freedom to run to serve the people of the 
United States. Their networks and net worth 
are simply not the best indicators of their 
strength as prospective public servants. In fact, 
helping ordinary Americans to run may create 
better policy for all Americans. 
(c) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this subtitle 
to ensure that all Americans who are otherwise 
qualified to serve this Nation are able to run for 
office, regardless of their economic status. By 
expanding permissible uses of campaign funds 
and providing modest assurance that testing a 
run for office will not cost one’s livelihood, the 
Help America Run Act will facilitate the can-
didacy of representatives who more accurately 
reflect the experiences, challenges, and ideals of 
everyday Americans.

‘‘(2)(A) The general counsel, upon receiving a 
complaint filed with the Commission under 
paragraph (1) or upon the basis of information 
ascertained by the Commission in the normal 
course of carrying out its supervisory respon-
sibilities, shall make a determination as to 
whether or not there is reason to believe that a 
person has committed, or is about to commit, a 
violation of this Act or chapter 95 or chapter 96 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and as to 
whether or not the Commission should either 
initiate an investigation of the matter or that 
the complaint should be dismissed. The general 
counsel shall promptly provide notification to 
the Commission of such determination and the 
reasons therefore, together with any written re-
sponse submitted under paragraph (1) by the 
person alleged to have committed the violation. 
Upon the expiration of the 30-day period which

such notification, the general counsel’s deter-
mination shall take effect, unless during such 
30-day period the Commission, by vote of a ma-
jority of the members of the Commission who are 
serving at the time, overrules the general coun-
sel’s determination. If the determination by the 
general counsel that the Commission should in-
vestigate the matter takes effect, or if the deter-
mination by the general counsel that the com-
plaint should be dismissed is overruled as pro-
vided under the previous sentence, the general 
counsel shall initiate an investigation of the 
matter on behalf of the Commission. 
‘‘(B) If the Commission initiates an investiga-
tion pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Commis-
sion, through the Chair, shall notify the subject 
of the investigation of the alleged violation. 
Such notification shall set forth the factual 
basis for such alleged violation. The Commission 
shall make an investigation of such alleged vio-
lation, which may include a field investigation 
or audit, in accordance with the provisions of 
this section. The general counsel shall provide 
notification to the Commission of any intent to 
issue a subpoena or conduct any other form of 
discovery pursuant to the investigation. Upon 
the expiration of the 15-day period which begins 
on the date the general counsel provides such 
notification, the general counsel may issue the 
subpoena or conduct the discovery, unless dur-
ing such 15-day period the Commission, by vote 
of a majority of the members of the Commission 
who are serving at the time, prohibits the gen-
eral counsel from issuing the subpoena or con-
ducting the discovery. 
‘‘(3)(A) Upon completion of an investigation 
under paragraph (2), the general counsel shall 
promptly submit to the Commission the general 
counsel’s recommendation that the Commission 
find either that there is probable cause or that 
there is not probable cause to believe that a per-
son has committed, or is about to commit, a vio-
lation of this Act or chapter 95 or chapter 96 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and shall in-
clude with the recommendation a brief stating 
the position of the general counsel on the legal 
and factual issues of the case. 
‘‘(B) At the time the general counsel submits 
to the Commission the recommendation under 
subparagraph (A), the general counsel shall si-
multaneously notify the respondent of such rec-
ommendation and the reasons therefore, shall 
provide the respondent with an opportunity to 
submit a brief within 30 days stating the posi-
tion of the respondent on the legal and factual 
issues of the case and replying to the brief of the 
general counsel. The general counsel shall 
promptly submit such brief to the Commission 
upon receipt. 
‘‘(C) Not later than 30 days after the general 
counsel submits the recommendation to the Com-
mission under subparagraph (A) (or, if the re-
spondent submits a brief under subparagraph 
(B), not later than 30 days after the general 
counsel submits the respondent’s brief to the 
Commission under such subparagraph), the 
Commission shall approve or disapprove the rec-
ommendation by vote of a majority of the mem-
bers of the Commission who are serving at the 
time.’’. 
(2) CONFORMING AMENDMENT RELATING TO INI-
TIAL RESPONSE TO FILING OF COMPLAINT.—Sec-
tion 309(a)(1) of such Act (52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(1))

(A) in the third sentence, by striking ‘‘the 
Commission’’ and inserting ‘‘the general coun-
sel’’; and 
(B) by amending the fourth sentence to read 
as follows: ‘‘Not later than 15 days after receiv-
ing notice from the general counsel under the 
previous sentence, the person may provide the 
general counsel with a written response that no 
action should be taken against such person on 
the basis of the complaint.’’.

BY COORDINATED SPENDERS 
FOR COVERED COMMUNICATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) PAYMENTS MADE IN COOPERATION, CON-
SULTATION, OR CONCERT WITH CANDIDATES.—For 
purposes of subsection (a)(1)(A), if the person 
who makes a payment for a covered communica-
tion, as defined in subsection (d), is a coordi-
nated spender under paragraph (2) with respect 
to the candidate as described in subsection 
(d)(1), the payment for the covered communica-
tion is made in cooperation, consultation, or 
concert with the candidate. 
‘‘(2) COORDINATED
SPENDER
DEFINED.—For 
purposes of this subsection, the term ‘coordi-
nated spender’ means, with respect to a can-
didate or an authorized committee of a can-
didate, a person (other than a political com-
mittee of a political party) for which any of the 
following applies: 
‘‘(A) During the 4-year period ending on the 
date on which the person makes the payment, 
the person was directly or indirectly formed or 
established by or at the request or suggestion of, 
or with the encouragement of, the candidate 
(including an individual who later becomes a 
candidate) or committee or agents of the can-
didate or committee, including with the ap-
proval of the candidate or committee or agents 
of the candidate or committee. 
‘‘(B) The candidate or committee or any agent 
of the candidate or committee solicits funds, ap-
pears at a fundraising event, or engages in 
other fundraising activity on the person’s behalf 
during the election cycle involved, including by 
providing the person with names of potential 
donors or other lists to be used by the person in 
engaging in fundraising activity, regardless of 
whether the person pays fair market value for 
the names or lists provided. For purposes of this 
subparagraph, the term ‘election cycle’ means, 
with respect to an election for Federal office, 
the period beginning on the day after the date 
of the most recent general election for that office 
(or, if the general election resulted in a runoff 
election, the date of the runoff election) and 
ending on the date of the next general election 
for that office (or, if the general election re-
sulted in a runoff election, the date of the run-
off election). 
‘‘(C) The person is established, directed, or 
managed by the candidate or committee or by 
any person who, during the 4-year period end-
ing on the date on which the person makes the 
payment, has been employed or retained as a 
political, campaign media, or fundraising ad-
viser or consultant for the candidate or com-
mittee or for any other entity directly or indi-
rectly controlled by the candidate or committee, 
or has held a formal position with the candidate 
or committee (including a position as an em-
ployee of the office of the candidate at any time 
the candidate held any Federal, State, or local 
public office during the 4-year period). 
‘‘(D) The person has retained the professional 
services of any person who, during the 2-year 
period ending on the date on which the person 
makes the payment, has provided or is providing 
professional services relating to the campaign to 
the candidate or committee, without regard to 
whether the person providing the professional 
services used a firewall. For purposes of this 
subparagraph, the term ‘professional services’ 
includes any services in support of the can-
didate’s or committee’s campaign activities, in-
cluding advertising, message, strategy, policy, 
polling, allocation of resources, fundraising, 
and campaign operations, but does not include 
accounting or legal services. 
‘‘(E) The person is established, directed, or 
managed by a member of the immediate family 
of the candidate, or the person or any officer or 
agent of the person has had more than inci-
dental discussions about the candidate’s cam-
paign with a member of the immediate family of 
the candidate. For purposes of this subpara-
graph, the term ‘immediate family’ has the 
meaning given such term in section 9004(e) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
‘‘(d) COVERED COMMUNICATION DEFINED.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sec-
tion, the term ‘covered communication’ means, 
with respect to a candidate or an authorized 
committee of a candidate, a public communica-
tion (as defined in section 301(22)) which— 
‘‘(A) expressly advocates the election of the 
candidate or the defeat of an opponent of the 
candidate (or contains the functional equivalent 
of express advocacy); 
‘‘(B) promotes or supports the election of the 
candidate, or attacks or opposes the election of 
an opponent of the candidate (regardless of 
whether the communication expressly advocates 
the election or defeat of a candidate or contains 
the functional equivalent of express advocacy); 
or 
‘‘(C) refers to the candidate or an opponent of 
the candidate but is not described in subpara-
graph (A) or subparagraph (B), but only if the 
communication is disseminated during the appli-
cable election period. 
‘‘(2) APPLICABLE ELECTION PERIOD.—In para-
graph (1)(C), the ‘applicable election period’ 
with respect to a communication means— 
‘‘(A) in the case of a communication which re-
fers to a candidate in a general, special, or run-
off election, the 120-day period which ends on 
the date of the election; or 
‘‘(B) in the case of a communication which re-
fers to a candidate in a primary or preference 
election, or convention or caucus of a political 
party that has authority to nominate a can-
didate, the 60-day period which ends on the 
date of the election or convention or caucus. 
‘‘(3) SPECIAL RULES FOR COMMUNICATIONS IN-
VOLVING CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES.—For pur-
poses of this subsection, a public communication 
shall not be considered to be a covered commu-
nication with respect to a candidate for election 
for an office other than the office of President 
or Vice President unless it is publicly dissemi-
nated or distributed in the jurisdiction of the of-
fice the candidate is seeking. 
‘‘(e) PENALTY.— 
‘‘(1) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT.—Any person 
who knowingly and willfully commits a viola-
tion of this Act by making a contribution which 
consists of a payment for a coordinated expendi-
ture shall be fined an amount equal to the 
greater of— 
‘‘(A) in the case of a person who makes a con-
tribution which consists of a payment for a co-
ordinated expenditure in an amount exceeding 
the applicable contribution limit under this Act, 
300 percent of the amount by which the amount 
of the payment made by the person exceeds such 
applicable contribution limit; or 
‘‘(B) in the case of a person who is prohibited 
under this Act from making a contribution in 
any amount, 300 percent of the amount of the 
payment made by the person for the coordinated 
expenditure.

rector, manager, or officer of a person who is 
subject to a penalty under paragraph (1) shall 
be jointly and severally liable for any amount of 
such penalty that is not paid by the person 
prior to the expiration of the 1-year period 
which begins on the date the Commission im-
poses the penalty or the 1-year period which be-
gins on the date of the final judgment following 
any judicial review of the Commission’s action, 
whichever is later.’’.

(1) REPEAL OF EXISTING REGULATIONS ON CO-
ORDINATION.—Effective upon the expiration of 
the 90-day period which begins on the date of 
the enactment of this Act—

nications adopted by the Federal Election Com-

mulgated regulations in accordance with para-

the extent that, the President or the President’s 
designee certifies (in writing) that, in light of all

tion outweighs the concern that a reasonable

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H973 
March 2, 2021 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to insert extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 1 into the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LOFGREN. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1, the For the 
People Act of 2021. Today, we can de-
liver this to the American people. We 
can deliver the gold standard of re-
forms to protect the right of Ameri-
cans to vote. We can take a huge step 
to fulfill that promise in our Constitu-
tion of a more perfect Union. 
More voters cast a ballot in the 2020 
election than in history, in an election 
that has been called the most secure in 
American history by election security 
experts. 
The last election, conducted during a 
once-in-a-generation 
pandemic, 
saw 
changes that made it easier for many 
Americans to vote, with reforms like 
absentee voting and early voting. It 
also put into stark focus what many of 
us already knew: deep inequities per-
sist in our democratic system. 
Now comes the backlash to the in-
crease in voter participation. That 
record turnout, with no credible in-
stances of election irregularity, stimu-
lated hundreds of bills in State legisla-
tures to make it harder for Americans 
to vote in the future. 
We should protect access to the bal-
lot, not restrict it. H.R. 1 gives voters 
choices for how to cast their ballot. 
They want and need that. 
The bill has a minimum of 15 days of 
early voting, minimum standards for 
the number and location of ballot drop 
boxes, and a national standard for no- 
excuse absentee voting. It improves ac-
cess for voters with disabilities, ad-
dresses challenges faced by Native 
American voters living on Tribal lands, 
and improves access for uniformed and 
overseas voters. 
H.R. 
1 
ends 
the 
practice 
of 
disenfranchising 
Americans 
with 
a 
prior felony conviction who are no 
longer incarcerated. It unrigs the draw-
ing of congressional district lines by 
requiring 
independent 
redistricting 
commissions, removing politics from 
the process and creating fairer maps. 
H.R. 1 begins to remove the advan-
tages of dark money and secret donors 
and lets our neighbors and commu-
nities regain their voice to fully par-
ticipate in our political system. 
H.R. 1 will amplify the voices of 
small donors with an alternative, vol-
untary matching system for financing 
campaigns by empowering small-dollar 
contributors, without any taxpayer 
funds. 
The bill will save money and bolster 
the integrity of election administra-
tion. It makes improvements to our 
election security and requires States to 
use individual, durable, voter-verified 
paper ballots, a simple safeguard from 
cybersecurity threats that ensures an 
auditable paper trail. 
H.R. 1 will also strengthen congres-
sional and executive branch ethical 
standards. 
Democracy is resilient, but the false-
hoods spread in the lead-up to and fol-
lowing the 2020 election, as well as the 
shocking events right here on January 
6, showed us all that democracy re-
quires us to defend it. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
H.R. 1 and ensure all Americans have 
an equal voice in our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, last week, this 
House voted on a bill that was sold as 
pandemic relief, yet less than 9 percent 
of that bill was for public health fund-
ing to combat COVID–19, and $140 mil-
lion of that bill is going to a failed rail 
project in Speaker PELOSI’s district. 
This week, the Democrats have put 
forth a bill titled ‘‘For the People,’’ but 
the bill has nearly 800 pages of provi-
sions that take election decisions away 
from State and local officials and put 
them in the hands of the Federal Gov-
ernment. It attacks Americans’ First 
Amendment right to free speech, and it 
publicly funds Members of Congress’ 
campaigns using corporate dollars. 
There is a pattern emerging. The 
Democrats are bringing bills to the 
floor under the guise of being for the 
people, but their bill actually benefits 
the politicians. 
As I said, I have many issues with 
H.R. 1, including the mandates this bill 
puts on States and provisions that at-
tack our First Amendment rights. But 
I want to focus on one particular provi-
sion in this bill right now, and that is 
how the Democrats’ number one pri-
ority is a bill that funds their own 
campaigns. 
H.R. 1 would launder corporate dol-
lars through the U.S. Treasury and use 
those dollars to publicly fund congres-
sional campaigns. Based on 2020 fund-
raising numbers, that creates access to 
more than $7 million in laundered cor-
porate dollar public funds to bolster 
my colleagues’ campaign coffers. This 
is the 6-to-1 match program that my 
colleague talked about for small-dollar 
donations. 
I know when I speak with my con-
stituents back home, establishing a 
program that helps me acquire more 
money for my campaign is not what 
they think the Federal Government 
should be working on. 
At the Rules Committee, because 
this bill did not go through regular 
order and did not receive a markup in 
the House Administration Committee, 
we submitted amendments to not only 
strike this program altogether and pre-
vent sitting Members of Congress from 
financially benefiting from this bill, 
but also requiring any increase in cor-
porate fines to be used to help the pan-
demic relief. 
I can think of a lot better ways to 
spend the $7 million that would be just 
for my district, like pandemic relief. 
We could maybe reopen our schools or 
rebuild a fund to help women’s shelters 
and rape crisis centers. Amazingly, 
Democrats wouldn’t even allow these 
amendments for a vote on the floor 
today. 
It is disappointing because I had 
hoped that we could all agree that 
helping our country through this pan-
demic or just simply focusing on the 
American people is more important 
than lining our own campaign coffers. 
Clearly, this bill is not for the benefit 
of the people, but it is for the politi-
cians’ campaign coffers. 
I also want to note that this bill is 
opposed by 16 secretaries of state, nine 
former FEC Commissioners, the Na-
tional Disability Rights Network, the 
Institute for Free Speech, and more 
than 130 other nonprofit organizations, 
but supported by Indivisible, a group 
whose sole purpose is to elect Demo-
crats. I think this speaks volumes as to 
why my friends on the other side of the 
aisle are rushing this bill through with 
little debate and next to no input from 
Republicans. 
Despite what my friends on the other 
side of the aisle continue to tell Ameri-
cans, this bill is not for the people. 
This bill is for the politicians. I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 1, the For 
the People Act, which would provide 
the most significant reform to our 
democratic system in decades. 
This 
landmark 
legislation 
will 
strengthen our democracy by expand-
ing access to the ballot, reducing the 
corrupting 
influence 
of 
corporate 
money in political campaigns, and re-
storing ethics and integrity to govern-
ment. 
H.R. 1 will make it easier for millions 
of Americans to vote and significantly 
increase the number of voters in this 
country by implementing initiatives 
like automatic voter registration. It 
will also implement reforms that will 
hold elected officials to a higher eth-
ical standard, such as requiring Presi-
dential candidates to disclose their tax 
returns. 
These are issues that I have intro-
duced legislation on in the previous 
Congress, and I am proud that they are 
included in H.R. 1. 
Finally, H.R. 1 will include the DIS-
CLOSE Act, which I introduced to 
shine a light on unlimited spending 
that has overrun our elections. With-
out fixing our broken system and tak-
ing power from the powerful special in-
terests and returning it to the people 
of this country, it will be almost im-
possible to make progress on the issues

that are important to the American 
people. 
The DISCLOSE Act will require orga-
nizations that spend money on our 
elections to promptly disclose donors 
who give $10,000 or more during an elec-
tion 
cycle, 
and 
prevent 
political 
operatives from actions meant to con-
ceal the identity of donors. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support the For the People 
Act, restore democracy, return power 
to the people of this country, and take 
it away from the powerful special in-
terests. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
LOUDERMILK), a great member of the 
House Administration Committee, and 
my good friend. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise, not only in opposition to this 
bill, but in strong opposition, espe-
cially to the attempt to nationalize our 
Federal elections, and the notion that 
people like Joseph Kirk, of Bartow 
County, Georgia, the elections super-
intendent, who has done a phenomenal 
job administering our elections, is not 
as qualified as people here in this room 
as to how to run an election. More im-
portantly, the idea that bureaucrats up 
here in Washington, D.C., can admin-
ister an election in Bartow County bet-
ter than our elections supervisor can 
and has is a notion beyond compare. 
In fact, this flies in the face of our 
Founders, especially those at the Con-
stitutional Convention. You see, there 
were arguments against Article I, Sec-
tion 4, the Elections Clause, because 
the fear that was stated was that those 
in power could use that power to ma-
nipulate elections to keep them in 
power, that one day someone would use 
this authority to manipulate the elec-
tions so they can maintain power. 
Madam Speaker, I believe we have ar-
rived at that. 
Now, Alexander Hamilton, he argued 
the opposite. He said it is important 
that institutions of government be able 
to preserve themselves, but this was a 
backup. It was a backup that the 
States had the priority to run their 
own elections. In fact, he said it should 
only be used when ‘‘extraordinary cir-
cumstances might render that inter-
position necessary to its safety.’’ 
We are not in that extraordinary cir-
cumstance. In fact, the extraordinary 
circumstance that will be stated over 
and over again is how we ran the elec-
tion in 2020 under COVID. 
Now, many of the provisions set out 
in this legislation, including universal 
mail-in ballots, a ban on voter ID laws, 
and mandated ballot harvesting, were 
changes that were made by States ille-
gally in 2020 that caused a lot of the 
problems that we saw. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
30 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
it may be a novel idea, but I stand 
firmly against Federal overreach in the 
constitutional responsibilities of State 
and local governments. Unfortunately, 
H.R. 1 flies in the face of our Gov-
ernors, our secretaries of state, our 
local election officials, and, more im-
portantly, the people of this Nation. 
If there is any other reason to be 
against it is why an 800-page bill went 
to 11 committees and could only re-
ceive 2 hours of a hearing in the small-
est committee in this body. The Amer-
ican people want to know what you are 
hiding when you continue to ramrod 
legislation through. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
would just note for the record that I 
am not worried about the administra-
tors in Georgia. I am worried about the 
legislature in Georgia that just passed 
restrictions cutting Sunday early vot-
ing and absentee voting and restricting 
the use of drop boxes to suppress the 
vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. 
MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the For the People 
Act, a bill that is critical to restoring 
elections as the heart of our democ-
racy. 
The For the People Act includes my 
bill, the Election Official Integrity 
Act, which would make it so election 
officials can’t have a direct stake in 
the outcome of the election that they 
are overseeing. Just like it would be 
wrong to have a player referee a game, 
it is wrong for election officials to par-
ticipate in Federal campaigns. 
As a representative of the great 
State of Georgia, I know the impact of 
our elections, and they are too impor-
tant and too valuable to the foundation 
of our democracy to risk even the ap-
pearance of impropriety. The Election 
Official Integrity Act is a common-
sense step toward restoring the Amer-
ican people’s confidence in our elec-
toral process. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand with me in supporting 
H.R. 1 and ensuring our Federal elec-
tion officials work for the people. 
b 0930 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
democracies die when one party seizes 
control of the elections process, elimi-
nates the safeguards that have pro-
tected the integrity of the ballot, 
places restrictions on free speech, and 
seizes the earnings of others to pro-
mote candidates they may abhor. That 
is the bill before us today. 
The most dangerous provision na-
tionalizes the mass mailing of ballots 
to voter rolls that contain untold num-
bers of people who have moved or died. 
It allows ballot harvesters to knock on 
doors and collect these ballots. There 
is no chain of custody from the time 
the ballot is mailed until the time it is 
returned. 
Ballots can be cast weeks before the 
election under the duress of family, 
friends, or precinct workers. Even if it 
doesn’t rob our elections of their ac-
tual legitimacy, it certainly robs them 
of their perceived legitimacy, destroy-
ing the trust that the loser of any elec-
tion must have to accept the winner 
was rightful. That is the bitter legacy 
of the last election under these prac-
tices. 
Why would anyone want to institu-
tionalize them? 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
am delighted to yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Ms. 
BOURDEAUX), a new member of our 
House. 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman LOFGREN for yield-
ing. 
After an election with record-break-
ing turnout in November, the Georgia 
General Assembly has recently intro-
duced a number of partisan bills to re-
strict voter registration and make it 
more difficult for Georgians to vote. 
Similar efforts are being made in 
States across the country. 
H.R. 1 would codify into law provi-
sions to protect voters from the sys-
temic efforts to suppress the vote, and 
I rise in strong support. Every voice 
must be heard and every vote must be 
counted. 
I would like to highlight my amend-
ment, cosponsored by a number of my 
Georgia colleagues. It would directly 
counter the threats posed by partisan 
voter suppression efforts across the 
country by ensuring that drop boxes 
are easily accessible to all Americans, 
no matter where they live. 
It would safeguard access to absentee 
ballots and promote voter registration 
efforts rather than trying to limit 
them. I urge my colleagues to pass 
H.R. 1 to protect the sacred right to 
vote. 
H.R. 1 will also end partisan gerry-
mandering, place people over special 
interests, and enable free and fair elec-
tions. I resolutely urge my colleagues 
to support the adoption of H.R. 1. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
TENNEY), the newest member of this 
Congress. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 1, the so- 
called For the People Act. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are touting this sweeping leg-
islation as a win for transparency and 
election integrity. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
This bill is an attempt to destroy de-
mocracy by federalizing aspects of U.S. 
elections constitutionally delegated to 
the States. It would prohibit common-
sense voter ID rules, encourage ballot 
harvesting, require no-excuse absentee 
and early voting, permit felons and 
noncitizens to vote, and make colleges 
and universities trusted voter registra-
tion agencies. 
I know firsthand the need for elec-
tion reform and the consequences of

March 2, 2021 
elections run without transparency and 
oversight. I was sworn into office over 
30 days late, after an exhaustive 100- 
day postelection count in the race for 
New York’s 22nd Congressional Dis-
trict. In the run-up to the 2020 election, 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 
rushed through a series of executive or-
ders that mirrored many of the policies 
the Democrats are now proposing in 
H.R. 1. The result was one of the most 
poorly run elections in the entire Na-
tion. It was a disgrace to our system of 
government. 
If H.R. 1 had become law, I can con-
fidently say it would have been vir-
tually impossible to conduct a fair and 
transparent race. New York’s election 
debacle reveals H.R. 1’s real-world con-
sequences. 
If this legislation had been adopted, 
the errors exposed in my race wouldn’t 
be the exception. It would have been 
bureaucratic chaos and that would 
have been the norm. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
30 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
New York. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, it is clear 
we need reforms to restore confidence 
in our elections, but what my Demo-
cratic colleagues are proposing would 
dramatically change election law. The 
American people are demanding a com-
monsense framework for election re-
form that strengthens security without 
compromising integrity. 
Congress should focus on delivering 
results to the American people, not 
perpetuating their own power at an ir-
reversible and grave cost to our demo-
cratic principles. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, this 
bill restores guardrails to our democ-
racy that almost went off the rails as 
Republicans pledged their loyalty to 
the cult of Donald Trump. Republicans 
have long found success creatively sup-
pressing the votes, restrictive voter ID 
laws, limiting voter hours, locations, 
and extreme gerrymandering. 
Having repressed votes for so long, it 
is hardly a surprise that their reaction 
to those voters who manage to over-
come the many obstacles placed in 
their way is now turned to throwing 
out and repressing the vote and ignor-
ing the will of the majority. 
Fearing 
voters, 
fearing 
account-
ability, in their opposition to this bill 
and in legislative efforts across the 
country in some 43 States, the Repub-
lican solution to losing power in the 
last election is to reduce the number of 
voters in the next election. 
Truth for them is not a matter of the 
facts. It is whatever Trump declares. 
Fraud is their description of any elec-
tion that they lose. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Texas an ad-
ditional 30 seconds. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Today’s bill favors 
turning out the votes, not throwing 
them out. Let’s protect American de-
mocracy which worships, above all, the 
voice of the people expressed through 
free and fair elections; not bowing be-
fore the golden idol of one who has be-
trayed our country. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
VALADAO), a refreshing sight to see 
back on the House floor. 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 1, the For the People 
Act. This piece of legislation under-
mines State authority over voter reg-
istration and election procedures while 
federally mandating practices we have 
seen fail in California during the 2018 
and 2020 election cycles. 
California’s motor voter law auto-
matically registers people to vote when 
registering their car or applying for a 
license with the DMV. This program 
was found to create over 120,000 errors, 
including registering at least 1,500 resi-
dents who were not eligible to vote. 
Senator PADILLA, while serving as 
California’s secretary of state at that 
time, stated these mistakes ‘‘threat-
ened to undermine public confidence in 
the program.’’ 
H.R. 1 exposes our elections to voter 
fraud and is especially dangerous at a 
time when so many Americans are 
questioning the validity of election re-
sults. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
voting ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, our democracy is in grave 
danger. We are seeing unrelenting ef-
forts across the country to suppress 
voters and limit access to the ballot 
box, particularly in communities of 
color. We are seeing record-breaking 
waves of dark money backing can-
didates and campaigns with no trans-
parency or accountability, and we are 
seeing efforts to increase partisan ger-
rymandering that allows politicians to 
pick and choose who they represent. 
It is wrong and it is undemocratic. 
We need to make it easier to vote for 
those who are legally eligible other-
wise to vote, not harder to do so. We 
need more transparency in our cam-
paigns, not less. We need to strengthen 
ethics rules, not weaken them, and we 
need to pass the For the People Act. 
This bill will transform our democ-
racy and return power to the people, 
where it belongs. It will ensure that 
every American who is eligible to vote 
can do so easily and securely. It will 
crack down on the culture of corrup-
tion that has defined Washington for 
far too long. It will finally end the era 
of dark money in our politics that has 
plagued this House for years. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to defend our democracy and to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
LUCAS), a very good friend. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 1. 
As 
the 
ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee, I am particularly concerned 
that H.R. 1 would adversely impact the 
work done by the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology on election 
security. 
NIST is responsible for conducting 
research on voting technologies, devel-
oping standards and best practices that 
help ensure the security of voting sys-
tems, and providing technical guidance 
to the Election Assistance Commis-
sion. In short, NIST’s work is critical 
to helping States and localities con-
duct safe, secure, and accessible elec-
tions. 
So why doesn’t this bill include any 
of the technical feedback provided by 
NIST last year? 
I am deeply concerned that we are 
limiting NIST’s ability to do their job. 
This is just one example of how this 
rushed 
attempt 
to 
score 
political 
points has given precedence over put-
ting forth meaningful legislation. This 
legislation would do more harm than 
good. I urge my colleagues to reject the 
bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
am honored to yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Ms. 
CRAIG). 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, across 
this country, people of all political per-
suasions are profoundly frustrated with 
the conflicts of interest and divisive 
politics practiced in this town. 
And who could blame them for their 
frustration? 
Their votes are being suppressed by 
power-hungry folks at all costs. The 
people are tired of the revolving door of 
lobbyists and special interests working 
to diminish their trust in this institu-
tion and in us. 
But maybe that is what some people 
want, for Americans to become so frus-
trated, bone tired of standing in long 
lines, that they just give up and go 
home. 
It is long past time that Congress 
brought a little more Minnesota com-
mon sense to America in clean and fair 
elections. That is exactly what this bill 
will accomplish by expanding voting 
rights, ending the dominance of dark 
money in our politics, and finally ad-
dressing partisan gerrymandering. 
We must reform if we are to hold on 
to this democracy. Madam Speaker, we 
must do it now. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. 
LESKO), my good friend. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I rise in opposition to this bill. 
H.R. 1 is for the politicians, not the 
people. The bill weaponizes the Federal 
Election 
Commission, 
infringes

States’ rights, and drastically limits 
freedom of speech. 
Arizona requires voter ID and pro-
hibits ballot harvesting. H.R. 1 will 
undo Arizona laws. 
This bill also puts people’s privacy 
and security at risk by requiring the 
disclosure of personal information for 
political advertisers. The bill is solely 
designed to benefit politicians from 
one particular political party. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to the time remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 19 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Illinois has 18 minutes remaining. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
am delighted to yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JONES), who is a new Member from New 
York and an expert in election law. 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, today, 
we legislate for the people. 
Our passage of H.R. 1 is deeply per-
sonal to me. Unlike many of the people 
we are used to seeing in our politics, I 
don’t come from money or from a polit-
ical family. I was raised by a young, 
single mother who worked multiple 
jobs to make ends meet, and we still 
needed Section 8 housing and food 
stamps to get by. 
Of course, my family struggles could 
be traced to one common cause, and 
that is our broken democracy. At the 
root of why housing, higher education, 
and healthcare are out of reach for so 
many millions of Americans is the fact 
that our democracy does not reflect 
the will of the American people. Inde-
pendent 
redistricting 
commissions 
would change that. 
When I ran for Congress, the first 
question political insiders asked me 
wasn’t what I would be campaigning on 
or how much support I had in my com-
munity, but, rather, how much money 
could I raise? 
Public campaign financing would 
change that. 
Many people were surprised that I de-
feated a billionaire who tried to pur-
chase this congressional seat. But my 
election should not be the exception to 
the rule; rather, it should be the norm. 
Once we pass H.R. 1, it will be. 
b 0945 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WOMACK), my good friend. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for the op-
portunity to speak. 
Madam Speaker, you don’t need to 
identify as a Republican or a Democrat 
to want free and fair elections. Frank-
ly, ask any American and I am pretty 
sure they will agree that the corner-
stone to any legitimate democracy is 
the ability to freely choose their lead-
ers. 
I am also pretty sure that they will 
agree that money has a way of cor-
rupting just about anything—including 
elections; which is why I shake my 
head at the language in this bill that 
provides a 6-to-1 match for donations 
up to $200. Last Congress, they tried to 
do it with taxpayer money. That didn’t 
go over so well, so now they try again; 
this time, with some crazy shell game 
to accomplish the same result. 
I also believe that most Americans 
will agree that the right to vote is 
among the most precious we have. It is 
more important than getting on an air-
line. It is more important than buying 
an adult beverage. It is more important 
than cashing a paycheck at your local 
bank. 
Why we would weaken our ability to 
prove certain the identities of people 
voting in our elections is a mystery to 
me. 
Trying to convince us that H.R. 1 is 
for the people is like saying, You are 
with the Federal Government and you 
are here to help us. 
No, thank you. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ). It is an honor to recognize 
her as a member of the Committee on 
House Administration and one of the 
newest Members in the House, but an 
accomplished attorney. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, increased voter participation 
should be the goal of every legislator, 
Republican or Democrat. Anything less 
is a betrayal of our democratic ideal. 
Madam Speaker, 4 million more 
Latino voters cast a ballot in 2020 than 
in 2016. Native Americans defied the 
devastation of COVID to come out and 
vote in higher numbers. And now, 
States across our country are trying to 
turn away these citizens. 
H.R. 1 is necessary, now more than 
ever, to protect the rights of every cit-
izen to register, to vote absentee, or by 
mail if you live on a reservation or just 
work on Tuesdays. 
We brought New Mexico’s experience 
to this bill to improve voting access for 
Native Americans, respect Tribal land 
boundaries during redistricting, and re-
duce wait times at the polls. 
Our democracy is the very founda-
tion on which we rest every American 
ideal. We love it, and we must protect 
it for the people. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from the great State of 
Minnesota 
(Mr. 
EMMER), 
my 
good 
friend. 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, for the second con-
secutive Congress, House Democrats 
have shown us what their priorities 
are. 
Is their top priority, H.R. 1, about 
improving roads and bridges? No. 
Is their top priority, H.R. 1, about 
improving access to healthcare? No. 
Is there top priority, H.R. 1, about 
ensuring that our communities are 
safe? Absolutely not. 
No, their number one priority is 
themselves and their elections. Instead 
of prioritizing these important issues, 
they have offered H.R. 1 to eliminate 
our State-based system of elections, to 
codify practices like ballot harvesting, 
and to establish a Federal match with 
taxpayer funds for campaign contribu-
tions. 
I guess Federalizing our elections be-
comes the only option when your ideas, 
the very thing our constituents should 
be judging us on, are defunding our po-
lice and promoting government-run 
healthcare. The American people have 
soundly rejected those ideas, but that 
hasn’t stopped our colleagues from 
finding a way to work around the will 
of the American people. 
Madam Speaker, the bill we are de-
bating 
today, 
H.R. 
1, 
is 
that 
workaround and, if adopted, will allow 
our colleagues to continue bypassing 
the issues most important to the peo-
ple while guaranteeing their reelection 
to Congress. 
The American people are smart, and 
they are going to remember when they 
step into the voting booths next No-
vember that the top priority for House 
Democrats was not to address the 
health or safety of the American peo-
ple, it was to undermine our Constitu-
tion in order to win elections. 
Madam Speaker, I urge everyone in 
this Chamber to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, it is 
interesting to listen to some of the 
comments that are made here this 
morning. We have talked a lot about 
Article I, Section 4, that says that the 
Congress may at any time regulate 
these elections. But what is the basis 
for that? It is really Article IV, Section 
4, which says, ‘‘The United States shall 
guarantee to every State in this Union 
a Republican Form of Government.’’ 
If a majority of voters vote and their 
votes are not powerful, they are not 
counted. Or if Americans are prohib-
ited from voting, even though they 
should be able to cast their vote, that 
is not a Republican form of govern-
ment. So what we are doing here is the 
most important thing we could do, 
which is to preserve our American de-
mocracy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER). 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding, 
and I thank JOHN SARBANES, my col-
league from Maryland, for all the work 
that he has done and the extraordinary 
leadership that ZOE LOFGREN has done 
in bringing this bill to the floor last 
year and bringing it back this year. It 
was passed with unanimous support on 
our side of the aisle because our Mem-
bers know that Americans are frus-
trated, and they feel somewhat shut 
out from their democracy. This is a bill 
for the people. 
I thank all of those who have worked 
for so long on making sure that Ameri-
cans have access to the ballot. 
Madam Speaker, last year, we lost an 
extraordinary giant in our country. His

March 2, 2021 
name was John Lewis, an acolyte of 
Martin Luther King Jr., and a servant 
for the people. 
This is a very, very important bill. 
One could say that everything else we 
do depends on this bill because, in our 
democracy, government only works if 
those it serves have faith that it is 
truly a government ‘‘of the people, by 
the people, and for the people.’’ 
Madam Speaker, of course, it was 
Abraham Lincoln who spoke those 
words, mourning those who gave their 
lives in a great struggle to preserve our 
Union as it faced the evils of slavery, 
sedition, and secession. 
That war was a war to not only give 
freedom to other human beings, but it 
was also a war, at its heart, which tried 
to live out the creed that all men are 
created equal; endowed by their cre-
ator—not by this Congress, not by the 
majority, not by the Constitution, not 
by the President, or any of us, but by 
their creator—with certain unalienable 
rights. And certainly, in a democracy, 
voting, knowing who you are voting 
for, knowing who you are supporting, 
who you are voting for are critical. 
Even in that dark moment of the 
Civil War, when so many were losing 
hope for the success of our great Amer-
ican experiment in democracy and con-
stitutional government, President Lin-
coln encouraged us to renew our faith 
as Americans in that project. 
Now, in 2021, though the crises we 
face are different than in 1863, our Na-
tion is clearly facing grave challenges. 
January 6 taught us that. January 6 
took us by the scruff of the neck and 
shook us and said, ‘‘Beware, lest you 
lose your democracy.’’ 
A pandemic has led to the deaths of 
more than half a million Americans. 
Its subsequent economic crisis has put 
more than 10 million out of work and 
millions of families and small busi-
nesses are struggling to get by. 
Deep racial and political divisions 
threaten to tear our country apart 
with misinformation and mistrust as 
dangerous to our Republic as any virus 
or recession. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple must have faith that their govern-
ment is truly theirs; their collective 
expression and will is heard; and that 
it can deliver results that improve 
their lives and offer them hope for a 
better future. That is what H.R. 1 does, 
the For the People Act: Reassure the 
American people that their govern-
ment will always work for them. 
First, it will protect the sacred right 
to vote—protect the sacred right to 
vote—by ensuring that every American 
can participate equally and without 
undue barriers to casting their ballots. 
No counting of jelly beans in a jar; no 
reciting verbatim the Constitution and 
Declaration of Independence; no poll 
tax; no effort to make it more difficult 
for people to register, more difficult to 
vote. 
Bloody Sunday, a stark example of 
how committed some people were and 
some people still are, to not permitting 
people 
who 
they 
think 
will 
vote 
against them to vote. 
H.R. 1 would be the most consequen-
tial piece of voting rights legislation 
enacted since we passed the Help Amer-
ica Vote Act, which I was proud to 
sponsor. 
Second, this bill roots out corruption 
in government by increasing ethical 
standards and limiting the corrosive ef-
fects of dark money in our political 
campaigns. 
My mother used to say: ‘‘Consider 
the source.’’ Consider who is talking to 
you. And if you don’t know who is con-
tributing, if you don’t know who is 
paying for those ads for Citizens for a 
Better America, who is against that. 
But you don’t know who it is. You 
don’t know what interest they have 
that they are paying out millions of 
dollars to promote. 
By forcing super-PACs to disclose 
their donors, H.R. 1 will ensure that 
American voters know exactly who is 
paying for the campaign ads they see 
or hear. And by requiring Presidential 
and Vice Presidential candidates to re-
lease 10 years’ worth of tax returns, as 
most have done—with one singular, 
stark exception—it will provide voters 
with information critical to ensuring 
that those seeking our highest offices 
are free from conflicts of interest. Are 
they representing themselves or are 
they representing the people? 
Third, H.R. 1 will end partisan redis-
tricting, whereby politicians choose 
their voters instead of the other way 
around. Too many voting districts are 
drawn in a way to limit voters’ voices 
in our democracy. 
So many times we saw the central 
city cut up into pies, where you had a 
sliver of the city here, a sliver of the 
city here. And all of you know that 
happened. What was it designed to do? 
To take away the voting power of those 
who the people in the State legislature 
did not like. 
Now, most of you are too young to 
remember Baker v. Carr and Reynolds 
v. Sims, when the Supreme Court said, 
‘‘Oh, no, we are not representing trees, 
we are representing people, and you are 
going to have to district.’’ 
And then we had subsequent legisla-
tion which said, you cannot make it 
impossible for certain constituencies 
to elect people who look like them, 
talk like them, think like them. That 
has to end, and the only way to do it is 
through a national approach that cre-
ates, as this bill does, a nonpartisan 
process in each State. 
Madam Speaker, lastly, H.R. 1 in-
cludes a number of provisions to in-
crease transparency and accountability 
so that the American people can see 
what their elected officials are doing 
and make sure they are doing their 
jobs properly. 
Through all of these steps, House 
Democrats will deliver on our pledge to 
renew Americans’ faith in government 
by making sure it works for the people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
legislation so consequential to our de-
mocracy and our ability to deliver re-
sults for our constituents. 
But I also ask the American people 
to join me in believing in what govern-
ment can achieve when we take steps 
to make it work in the way our Found-
ers intended. 
With the challenges we are facing, 
with the divisions and mistrust that 
abound, let us seize this moment, as 
Lincoln once did, to rededicate our-
selves to the work of ensuring that 
‘‘government of the people, by the peo-
ple, and for the people shall not perish 
from this Earth.’’ 
Let us do so with a strong—and my 
hope is bipartisan—vote to pass H.R. 1 
and send it to the Senate. 
Mr. ROY. Will the gentleman from 
Maryland yield? 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I would 
be glad to yield to my friend. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman yielding. 
Madam Speaker, as the gentleman 
knows, we have had a dialogue back 
and forth about the need for amend-
ment, the need for debate on the floor. 
And what I would ask the gentleman 
is, for example, if the gentleman would 
agree that in 2004 we had former Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter, Democrat, and 
James 
Baker, 
Republican—hardly 
ideologues from the standpoint of divi-
sion that we see today—agree that 
there are issues of bail and balance. 
And what I would ask is: Why don’t 
we have a debate here on the problems 
and concerns and potential fraud with 
mail-in ballots that is a nonpartisan 
concern? That is one example, and 
there are bunch. Why do we not have 
that debate robustly here on the floor 
for the American people to see, if we 
are talking about transparency? 
And I ask the question respectfully of 
the gentleman from Maryland. 
b 1000 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I think 
that is a legitimate debate to have. I 
think we have been having that debate. 
Very frankly, I tell my friend from 
Texas that I think we won that debate. 
We won it in the courts over and over 
and over again, but understand that 
does not mean we ought not to have 
the debate here. 
Madam Speaker, I would not be op-
posed to such a debate. This bill, I 
think, is a bill which has been debated 
over and over again in committee and 
on the floor and has passed through the 
Senate. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
Senate 
didn’t take it up. We didn’t have a con-
ference because they had a different 
perspective on the question the gen-
tleman raises. They chose not to de-
bate it. They chose not to address it. 
They chose to ignore the problems that 
clearly do exist. 
Madam Speaker, I think the gentle-
man’s point is well-taken. I think, at 
some point in time in the future, we 
ought to have that debate, either on 
legislation you introduce or others in-
troduce. I would support that effort.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H978 
March 2, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, just for the viewers 
on C-Span who wondered why time 
stopped here in the House for that 
minute the majority leader spoke, I 
want to remind them all that is what 
we call the majority leader’s magic 
minute. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
PFLUGER), my good friend and one of 
the newest Members. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, a 
twisted conglomerate of partisan poli-
cies meant to consolidate powers here 
in Washington, D.C., to fully cement 
the swamp. 
This bill bans voter ID requirements 
nationwide. It permanently expands 
mail-in voting and legalizes ballot har-
vesting. 
Madam Speaker, I am particularly 
disturbed by the fact that, if this bill 
passes, taxpayer dollars will be directly 
funneled to congressional candidates 
and campaigns. The folks in my dis-
trict, the 11th District of Texas, abso-
lutely do not approve of their hard- 
earned dollars paying for TV attack 
ads of any candidate, much less a can-
didate they don’t support. 
Madam Speaker, we need real, com-
monsense reforms to strengthen our 
election system. H.R. 1 does just the 
opposite. I urge my colleagues to have 
this debate, to have a transparent de-
bate, to talk about these issues, and to 
come to the table for a reasonable, 
thoughtful debate so that we can get to 
the real issues that the American peo-
ple deserve. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN), chairman of 
the Subcommittee on the Constitution, 
Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this is 
an important and good bill. It is a com-
prehensive bill that takes in a lot of 
issues that are important to giving 
people the opportunity to vote and the 
opportunity to elect their leaders in 
fair manners. The most important, I 
think, as Leader HOYER addressed all 
the points, is redistricting, to have 
nonpartisan redistricting commissions 
decide how the State legislatures and 
the congressional seats will be designed 
so that they are geographic, under-
standable, and done without the intent 
of electing a particular party to that 
position. 
Madam Speaker, right now, most of 
the districts are determined in the pri-
mary; that is why we don’t have com-
petitive districts and people coming 
closer to the center to try to work to-
gether. 
This bill also has the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Act. John Lewis was the 
conscience of the Congress. He almost 
gave his life in Selma, Alabama, to try 
to get the right to vote for people. No-
body should have to do that. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
BIGGS), my good friend. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, the ma-
jority leader just said: Everything we 
do depends on this bill. 
I guess he is right because the Demo-
crats are trying to tip the scales of 
elections to their party. Besides giving 
the uni-party in the swamp power, 
funding politicians with taxpayer dol-
lars, and preventing the use of voter 
identification laws, Democrats will 
prevent ballot harvesting and mandate 
nationwide mail-in balloting, which 
Jimmy Carter himself said is a recipe 
for fraud. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats are so 
enamored of power, it appears that 
they want to legalize cheating in elec-
tions. If that isn’t enough for you, they 
want 16-year-olds to be able to register 
to vote, as well as felons and illegal 
aliens to be able to vote. What could 
possibly go wrong? 
Madam Speaker, while most in the 
country have some doubt as to the in-
tegrity of our elections across both 
parties, my colleagues across the aisle 
want to ensure we never have an hon-
est election again. 
This bill is a dubious path on which 
to embark. If we do not stop it again, 
it will become increasingly difficult to 
depart to a better road that actually 
restores trust in America. 
Madam Speaker, when I hear the ar-
gument of voter suppression, I say we 
had more voters in the last election for 
President than ever—more than ever. 
This bill is a monstrosity. It is a waste. 
It is unnecessary. I urge people to vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 1, and I 
commend the Speaker, the majority 
leader, Chair LOFGREN, and Represent-
ative SARBANES for their unwavering 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, we live in a cynical 
age. Some of this is due to the fact 
that the wealthy and well-connected 
have been granted access and influence 
in the halls of power far beyond what is 
fair. The results speak for themselves— 
massive economic, health, and wealth 
disparities. It is also due to the fact 
that we have seemingly entered a post- 
truth era in which facts have less of a 
grip on public debate, particularly on 
our social media platforms. 
Madam Speaker, the race to the bot-
tom continues, whether it is the big lie 
about the election, or gaslighting the 
American people about the political 
leanings of insurrectionists, or the de-
nial of climate change. 
The roots of these problems cannot 
be solved unless we reform our govern-
ment, starting today. H.R. 1 is needed 
to help dissolve the cynicism and en-
sure that facts and honesty have a 
place at the table once again. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join us in passing H.R. 1. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, in spite of my hesi-
tance to trust this timing, can I get a 
time check to see how much we have 
left? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Each 
side has 121⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
STEIL), another member of the Com-
mittee on House Administration. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, we must 
protect voting integrity. The bill be-
fore us today, H.R. 1, nationalizes our 
elections. It imposes poorly drafted, 
unconstitutional mandates on States. 
The bill weakens critical voter integ-
rity provisions. Let me explain. 
Madam Speaker, first, the bill guts 
voter ID protections. For example, in 
Wisconsin, a State with strong voter 
ID laws, this law would allow an indi-
vidual to vote without an ID by simply 
providing a sworn statement. That is 
it. 
Are there other areas where we would 
allow individuals to avoid our laws so 
easily? Could you board an airplane by 
simply providing a statement as to who 
you are? The purpose of this provision 
is to weaken the integrity of our elec-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, wait, there is more. 
This bill legalizes ballot harvesting. In 
Wisconsin, we saw a clerk in Madison 
conduct ballot collections in broad 
daylight. This bill would legalize ballot 
harvesting nationwide. The purpose of 
this provision is to weaken the integ-
rity of our elections. 
Madam Speaker, if that is not bad 
enough, just wait. There is more. This 
bill will allow Federal funding of con-
gressional campaigns. It would give 
government money to fund politicians’ 
reelection campaigns. It would give 
government money to buy negative TV 
ads. I am not sure about all my col-
leagues in this House, but I can tell 
you that not once has an individual 
told me that the problem with our elec-
tions is there is just not enough 
money. 
Madam Speaker, we need to strength-
en our election system. We need to pro-
tect the integrity of our elections. This 
bill nationalizes our elections, weakens 
voter integrity, is an affront to the 
First Amendment, and is a poor use of 
government money. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in opposing this bill, 
H.R. 1. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
just received word that the legendary 
civil rights leader Vernon Jordan has 
passed. In addition to our beloved John 
Lewis, I feel we are considering this 
bill in his memory and also to honor 
those who came before us who worked 
so hard to preserve our American de-
mocracy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I join 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
LOFGREN) in her beautiful acknowledg-
ment of the passing of Vernon Jordan. 
Madam Speaker, I also commend her 
for her great leadership in honoring

March 2, 2021 
our Constitution with this For the Peo-
ple legislation. I am fond of saying of 
Chairwoman LOFGREN that she has so 
much experience, so much knowledge, 
such deep values about our Constitu-
tion and about our electoral system 
and how they are connected. I thank 
her for her tremendous leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank JOHN 
SARBANES for his long-term dedication 
to this For the People legislation so 
that we can have elections that enable 
people to participate more fully. That 
is what this is all about. Mr. SARBANES 
chaired the Democracy Reform Task 
Force. He is the godfather of this bill. 
His determination, his deliberation, 
and his dedication to democracy have 
brought us to this important moment 
for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I am especially 
pleased that this moment is happening 
in March when it is Women’s History 
Month because I am very fond of say-
ing that if we reduce the role of money 
in politics and increase the level of de-
cency and civility, we will be able to 
elect many more women, many more 
people of color, many more young peo-
ple into elective office. I am absolutely 
certain of that in terms of women, and 
this legislation does just that. 
Madam Speaker, ‘‘We the people,’’ 
the first words of the Preamble to the 
Constitution, how appropriate that 
that is what this legislation is called. 
I come to this conversation, not just 
as Speaker of the House, but as a per-
son who, for years, was a leader in the 
California Democratic Party. Our pur-
pose was to remove obstacles of par-
ticipation for Democrats or Repub-
licans. That is what the law requires. 
That was the right thing to do. Wheth-
er it was in registration or getting out 
the vote, we had to be nonpartisan. 
That is what this legislation does. 
Madam Speaker, it is very inter-
esting in the rules of the House that we 
can have people misrepresent the facts, 
but if we call them on it, our words are 
taken down for mistrusting the integ-
rity of Members. But let’s be very 
clear: There is no public funding use of 
taxpayer money for congressional races 
in this legislation, no matter what you 
hear someone else say. There will be an 
amendment on the floor. 
Madam Speaker, speaking of amend-
ments, there are 56 amendments. The 
list takes pages and pages and pages, so 
this will take a couple of days to deal 
with. This idea that we don’t have a 
full discussion and full amendment 
process, let’s not talk about process. 
Let’s talk about the policy and what 
we hope to achieve. 
The first 300 pages of this bill were 
written by John Lewis to eliminate 
voter suppression, which has become 
rampant in our country. How do we say 
to our Founders, ‘‘We salute you for 
what you have done, and we are going 
to do everything in our power to make 
sure we suppress the vote’’? It is so in-
consistent. We see even just in recent 
days a torrent of pieces of legislation 
to reduce voter participation. So, that 
is what we are going to do. 
Madam Speaker, another aspect of 
this that distorts our democracy is the 
partisan gerrymandering. That is why I 
salute the distinguished chairwoman 
for her leadership for a long time now 
in putting forth redistricting by way of 
commission. 
b 1015 
The people should choose their politi-
cians. Politicians should not be choos-
ing their voters by this political gerry-
mandering. This legislation does that. 
Part of voter suppression that people 
don’t always recognize is the suffo-
cation of the airways of big, dark, spe-
cial interest money. 
And one aspect of this bill that has 
such popular appeal is the fact that 
people will realize if we reduce the role 
of big, dark money in politics, we in-
crease the voices of the people. We will 
have a better chance to preserve our 
planet if big, dark money, special in-
terest money is not weighing in. 
We have a better chance of pro-
tecting our children from gun violence 
with background check legislation if 
big, dark money, in terms of our gun 
lobbies, is not weighing in. We have a 
chance 
to 
reduce 
the 
cost 
of 
healthcare. We have the chance to in-
crease paychecks. The list goes on and 
on. 
Big, dark money has been an obstacle 
to progress for America’s working fam-
ilies, suppressing the ability of people 
to bargain collectively, suppressing the 
rights of workers in our country. So, 
again, this is, as Mr. SARBANES says, 
this caffeinates all the other issues be-
cause it gives people confidence that it 
really can happen, that we really can 
pass legislation that is not dominated, 
and the debate of it is not suffocated. 
The 
airways 
suffocated 
big, 
dark 
money. 
Of course, we have to look at what is 
happening in terms of misinformation 
in the social media and the rest. And 
what we want to do is to clear the air; 
clear the air of that big, dark money; 
clear 
the 
air 
of 
political 
gerry-
mandering; and clear the air of the 
voter suppression that is out there. 
Just last night, the Georgia House 
passed a draconian new voter restric-
tion bill, which would end weekend 
voting, slash the number of mail ballot 
drop boxes, impose restrictive voter ID 
for mail ballots, among other actions. 
They know that their issues are los-
ers with the America people when they 
oppose some of the issues that are very 
popular in the public domain. They 
know that big money and voter sup-
pression is their path to victory, and 
that is why they are engaged in this. 
These voter suppression tactics are 
fundamentally discriminatory. 
In 2018, 70 percent of the Georgia vot-
ers purged from the rolls were African 
American. And nationwide, counties 
with larger minority populations had 
fewer polling places and poll workers 
per voter. In fact, 1 in 13 Black Ameri-
cans cannot vote due to disenfranchise-
ment laws nationwide. 
We must ensure that all voters have 
a voice in their democracy, particu-
larly in light of many grave challenges 
that our Nation faces today. Strong, 
clean, ethical leadership for the people 
is needed to tackle today’s crisis, rang-
ing from the pandemic and economic 
crisis to the national reckoning on ra-
cial equality and justice, and, as I men-
tioned earlier, the surging climate cri-
sis. 
The For The People Act will meet 
this moment. Again, the moment: re-
storing the public’s trust in govern-
ment, and re-empowering our leaders 
to fight in the people’s interest, not 
the special interest. It will combat big, 
dark money in politics, taking on the 
power of special interests, forcing dis-
closure, reining in the lobbyist influ-
ence and empowering small donors. 
I do believe that one of the most un-
democratic acts of the Supreme Court 
of the United States in its history was 
the so-called Citizens United decision. 
How could the Justices of the Su-
preme Court ever have made such a de-
cision? 
I don’t know if they examined their 
conscience in light of what has hap-
pened since then with big, dark money 
weighing in. And they gave very little 
opportunity—usually when the Court 
makes a decision, Congress can act, 
change the law, change the perspective, 
make it more constitutional, whatever 
the question is; but not with Citizens 
United. They went all out, closed every 
window to any opportunity to make 
change in the House of Representa-
tives, except one: Disclosure. 
Disclosure. They said, okay, you can 
pass a law that says you must disclose. 
When this decision was made, we tried 
to have a disclosure act. We had 59 
votes in the Senate, not 60. So we 
couldn’t pass it because the Repub-
licans in the Senate said, No, we can-
not insist on disclosure. 
When that happened, the Chamber of 
Commerce, it was reported that they 
said, oh, if we had to disclose, our 
members would not be giving of their 
chamber, would not be giving in the big 
amounts because they didn’t want the 
public, their employees, their cus-
tomers, their clients to know how 
much big money they were spending to 
suppress the vote and the discussion in 
our country. 
So the Republicans supported low 
disclosure. The money flowed and con-
tinues to flow. It must be stopped. 
Now, it would take a constitutional 
amendment 
to 
overturn 
Citizens 
United, and I think we should strive for 
that. However, in the meantime, it 
would take an act of Congress to say: 
You are proud of who you are sup-
porting in a big, dark money way? 
Disclose it. Let’s have disclosure. 
The public has a right to know, your 
employees have a right to know, your 
customers and your community has a 
right to know how you are weighing in 
against their interests, against clean 
air for their children, clean safety in

terms of water safety in their neigh-
borhoods in terms of gun violence pro-
tection, safety in terms of preserving 
the planet, safety in terms of issues 
that relate to the health. The list goes 
on and on. 
There is a direct connection between 
the suppression of the vote; the suffo-
cation of the airways with big, dark 
money; and the health and well-being 
of the American people. 
So this bill will combat big, dark 
money in politics. As I said, it will ex-
pand voting rights, ensuring secure and 
accurate elections, guarding elections 
from foreign interference. Let me say 
that again. 
Why would the Republicans oppose 
guarding the elections from foreign in-
terference? 
This is one of the most popular as-
pects of this legislation in the public. 
Again, the For the People Act would 
hold elected officials accountable, es-
tablishing tougher ethics, establishing 
conflict of interest rules for all govern-
ment officials to ensure that public of-
ficials are working for the public good. 
The For the People Act is unifying, 
supported by a majority of the Amer-
ican people across the country, Demo-
crats, Republicans, Independents, more 
than 170 civil rights groups, environ-
mental, faith-based, consumer protec-
tion, and gun safety groups, all of 
whom know this legislation is urgently 
needed. 
Two examples. Stacey Abrams of 
Fair Fight wrote yesterday: ‘‘The For 
the People Act understands the facets 
of free and fair elections: mitigating 
voter suppression, advancing a fair re-
districting process, and empowering 
small dollar donors to have a more 
prominent rule in our elections. To-
gether, this comprehensive bill signals 
a restoration of our Nation’s commit-
ment to the most durable democratic 
Republic.’’ 
I will say it again: Together, this 
comprehensive bill signals a restora-
tion of our Nation’s commitment to 
the world’s most durable democratic 
Republic, the United States of Amer-
ica. 
Passing and enacting H.R. 1 will put 
the American people back in charge of 
the Republic, paving the way for trans-
formative progress in terms of policy 
for our country, for the future, for our 
children. With this legislation, we can 
build back better for the people, ad-
vancing 
justice, 
opportunity, 
and 
progress for families in every ZIP Code. 
Madam Speaker, to restore our de-
mocracy and to advance progress for 
the people, I urge a strong vote for 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act. 
Again, I express my appreciation to 
Madam Chair ZOE LOFGREN, JOHN SAR-
BANES, and so many others; MONDAIRE 
JONES, speaking for the freshman class 
and what it means to young people to 
come into the process, not to be 
blocked by big, dark money and foreign 
influence in our elections. 
Vote against foreign influence in 
elections. Vote for H.R. 1. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, no matter how 
many times Speaker PELOSI and the 
Democrats continue to say that there 
is not a publicly funded program to put 
money directly into her Members’ con-
gressional campaigns, it doesn’t make 
her statement true. 
In this bill, it is the first-ever cor-
porate 
money 
since 
1907 
that 
is 
laundered through the Federal Govern-
ment, 
through 
the 
Department 
of 
Treasury, and goes right into our own 
congressional campaigns, up to $7 mil-
lion, using 2020 numbers. 
Madam Speaker, I am angry that the 
Speaker 
continues 
to 
talk 
about 
States, like Georgia, following the law 
to make sure that their voter rolls are 
complete and accurate when, in her 
own home State of California, the cor-
rupt secretary of state would not even 
commit to removing over 400,000 de-
ceased or moved voters from the voter 
rolls, and many of them, if not all of 
them, got live ballots. 
This bill would place the corruption 
that we see in California and export it 
nationwide. Let me tell you, that cor-
rupt secretary of state, huh, what a 
deal, we now call him a U.S. Senator. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I would 
point out that the Speaker of the 
House came to the floor and used her 
magic minute, but doesn’t stay on the 
floor and debate. There is no debate on 
this floor. 
And then the Speaker said that there 
were 
amendments, 
56 
amendments. 
Forty-nine of them are Democratic 
amendments, hand-selected by a small 
group in the Rules Committee. Forty- 
nine are Democratic amendments. 
So don’t buy into the Kabuki theater 
that you are seeing on the floor of the 
House of Representatives. 
You know what? 
I can’t ask to take down the words of 
the Speaker, even though the essence 
of her argument is that I am a bigot. 
Let’s be very clear. The arguments 
being distilled on the floor today is 
that Republicans, my colleagues and I, 
that we are bigots. 
Why? 
Because they use fancy words like 
‘‘voter suppression’’ to say that we are 
wanting to tamp down people’s access 
to polls. 
Nothing can be further from the 
truth. Heaven forbid we want to use 
voter identification. Heaven forbid we 
want to honor the will of the people 
through their legislature in the States 
passing rules to make sure that our 
system is actually working, using 
voter identification that the American 
people use to fly, that the American 
people use to do everything else. If I 
demand that, I am a bigot.

DECLARATION FOR AMERICAN 
DEMOCRACY, 
February 5, 2021. 
Re More than one hundred and fifty Groups 
urge support for the For the People Act 
(H.R. 1/S. 1). 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: On behalf of 
the below organizations representing tens of 
millions of Americans, we write in strong 
support of H.R. 1/S. 1, the For the People 
Act. This transformational democracy re-
form package would help return power to ev-
eryday American families and amplify the 
voices of communities that have historically 
been marginalized in our democracy. 
For far too long, special interests, wealthy 
donors, and vote suppressors have dominated 
our politics and attempted to silence the 
voices of everyday Americans, especially in 
Black and Brown communities. The For the 
People Act would help shift power away from 
bad actors and transfer it to ‘‘we the peo-
ple.’’ 
The 2020 election has underscored the ur-
gent need for transformational democracy 
reform. Across the nation, Americans experi-
enced unprecedented voter suppression, his-
toric levels of dark money spent to drown 
out the voices of everyday Americans, and 
rampant ethical abuses. One bill, the For the 
People Act, addresses many of these prob-
lems. Therefore, we are urging Congress to 
make this pro-voter, anti-corruption legisla-
tion a first priority in the 117th Congress. 
Common-sense reforms in the For the Peo-
ple Act, most of which are deeply popular 
across the political spectrum and have 
passed in many states and localities, aim to 
accomplish three overarching goals: (1) pro-
tecting and strengthening the sacred right to 
vote, (2) ending the dominance of big money 
in politics, and (3) implementing anti-cor-
ruption, pro-ethics measures to clean up gov-
ernment. 
Many of the critical issues that our nation 
faces—ensuring quality, affordable health 
care, creating good paying jobs, combating 
climate change, and achieving racial justice, 
to name just a few—cannot be fully solved 
until we fix our broken democracy. Wealthy 
special interests have too strong of a grip on 
the status quo, and we need to first unlock 
this stranglehold that they have on our po-
litical system. 
We therefore urge you to support and vote 
for H.R. 1/S. 1, the For the People Act, early 
in the 117th Congress to help put the people 
back in charge of our democracy.

Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
will include in the RECORD more letters 
in support of this legislation, H.R. 1. I 
also include letters from the Leader-
ship Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights and a letter from attorneys gen-
eral around the United States: the at-
torneys general of Maryland, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Delaware, the District of 
Columbia, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massa-
chusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Ne-
vada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New 
York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Is-
land, Vermont, Virginia, and Wash-
ington. The attorneys general of all of 
these States have written in support of 
H.R. 1. 
THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE 
ON CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS, 
January 19, 2021. 
SUPPORT H.R. 1, THE FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of The 
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights, a coalition of more than 220 national 
organizations committed to promoting and 
protecting the civil and human rights of all 
persons in the United States, and the 82 un-
dersigned organizations, we write in strong 
support of H.R. 1, the For the People Act. We 
are pleased that the incoming Senate leader-
ship has today announced it intends to intro-
duce this critical bill as S. 1. 
The For the People Act represents a trans-
formative vision for American democracy. It 
would create a democracy that welcomes 
every eligible voter’s chance to participate 
in civic life and a democracy that demands 
integrity, fairness, and transparency in our 
nation’s elections. For far too long, voter 
suppression has been a shameful reality in 
our country—undercutting the power and 
representation 
of 
African 
Americans, 
Latinos, Asian Americans and Pacific Island-
ers, Native Americans, people with disabil-
ities, Arab Americans, and other commu-
nities historically excluded from our polit-
ical process. The ability to meaningfully 
participate in our democracy is a racial jus-
tice issue. It is a civil rights issue. And the 
need for legislative action is urgent. The 
U.S. House of Representatives passed the For 
the People Act in March 20 I 9, and we are 
pleased that Speaker Pelosi has committed 
to making this bill a top priority in the new 
Congress. 
The recent and deadly attack on the U.S. 
Capitol by far-right extremists attempting 
to overturn the free, fair, and secure 2020 
presidential election was a catastrophic re-
minder of the fragility of our democracy. 
This violent insurrection did not happen in a 
vacuum. It was paired with numerous hur-
dles that voters faced during the pandemic- 
plagued 2020 election cycle and exacerbated 
by the relentless efforts by President Trump 
to undermine election integrity, impose bar-
riers to the ballot box, and discount the 
votes of communities of color. These experi-
ences reinforce the urgent need to repair our 
democratic system. The historic voter turn-
out in the November election despite these 
challenges demonstrated the determination 
and resilience of the American people. 
Not every flaw in our democracy can be 
easily fixed, but there are strong and ready 
solutions to many of the most significant 
voting rights problems. H.R. 1 would enhance 
and ensure democracy in America by estab-
lishing many critical reforms in federal elec-
tions, including: 
Ensuring early voting and polling place no-
tice: H.R. 1 would require at least 15 consecu-
tive days of in-person early voting including 
weekends, for a minimum of 10 hours each 
day, and ensure that early voting polling 
places are accessible by public transpor-
tation. The bill would also require that vot-
ers be given a minimum of seven days’ notice 
if their polling place location is changed. 
Safeguarding the right to vote by mail: 
Sixteen states require voters to provide an 
excuse as to why they are unable to vote in 
person on election day in order to receive an 
absentee ballot. This practice is designed to 
impede the vote and was particularly galling 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. H.R. I would 
eliminate such restrictions on the right to 
vote by mail. The bill would require the pre-
payment of postage by the government on 
return envelopes for absentee ballots or 
voter registration forms. 
Reforming voter registration: Nearly 20 
percent of people who are eligible but do not 
vote cite registration hurdles as the main 
reason for not voting. H.R. 1 would mod-
ernize America’s voter registration system 
and improve access to the ballot box by re-
quiring states to establish automatic voter 
registration (‘‘AVR’’), same day registration 
(‘‘SDR’’), and online voter registration for 
voters across the country, and by ensuring 
that all voter registration systems are inclu-
sive and accessible for people with disabil-
ities. A YR alone could add an estimated 50 
million people to the voter rolls, and SDR in-
creases voter turnout by roughly 10 percent. 
Ensuring reasonable wait times to vote: 
Voters in some states last year were forced 
to stand in line for more than 10 hours to 
vote, and recent studies have shown that 
such barriers occur more frequently in com-
munities of color. H.R. I would require states 
to ensure that voters do not have to wait 
longer than 30 minutes to cast their ballot at 
a polling place. 
Permitting voting without a photo ID: Be-
tween 2010 and 2020, 16 states enacted strict 
voter identification laws. H.R. I requires 
states to allow registered voters in states 
with a photo ID requirement to sign a sworn 
affidavit to vote if they lack a photo ID. 
Requiring access to drop boxes: During the 
2020 election cycle, some states politicized 
and limited the use of drop boxes. H.R. 1 
would require states to provide secure drop 
boxes as an option for voters casting absen-
tee ballots.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H982 
March 2, 2021 
Restoring voting rights for formerly incar-
cerated people: H.R. I would restore voting 
rights for people with felony convictions who 
have finished their sentence, a necessary re-
pudiation of our nation’s discriminatory and 
racially violent past. This would re-enfran-
chise approximately 4.7 million voters na-
tionwide. Reforming felony disenfranchise-
ment has strong bipartisan support; in 2018, 
65 percent of Florida voters cast their ballots 
to restore the right to vote for over 1.4 mil-
lion people. 
Combating voter purging: H.R. 1 would 
overturn the Supreme Court’s troubling 2018 
decision in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Insti-
tute that allowed Ohio to conduct massive 
purges from its voter rolls based on non-vot-
ing in past elections. Such practices dis-
proportionately target and remove tradition-
ally marginalized people from registration 
rolls. Voting should not be a ‘‘use it or lose 
it’’ right. 
Prohibiting deceptive practices and voter 
intimidation: H.R. 1 would ban the distribu-
tion of false information about elections to 
hinder or discourage voting. This provision 
is particularly important in an era in which 
Facebook, Twitter, and other digital plat-
forms have been readily manipulated to 
spread misinformation about elections and 
voting rights to vulnerable communities. 
The bill would also increase the criminal 
penalties for intimidating a voter for the 
purpose of interfering with their right to 
vote or causing them to vote for or against 
a candidate. 
Reforming redistricting: H.R. 1 would be a 
milestone in the battle against the extreme 
partisan gerrymandering our country has 
witnessed in recent years, by requiring 
states to draw congressional districts using 
independent redistricting commissions that 
are bipartisan and reflect the demographic 
diversity of the region. It would establish 
fair redistricting criteria and safeguard vot-
ing rights for communities of color. 
Modernizing election administration: H.R. 
1 would reauthorize the Election Assistance 
Commission—an 
independent, 
bipartisan 
commission that plays a vital role in ensur-
ing the reliability and security of voting 
equipment used in our nation’s elections. It 
would also promote election reliability and 
security by requiring voter-verified perma-
nent paper ballots and enhanced poll worker 
recruitment and training. And H.R. 1 would 
prohibit state election administrators from 
taking an active part in a political campaign 
over which they have supervisory authority. 
Committing to restoring the Voting Rights 
Act (‘‘VRA’’): H.R. 1 contains a commitment 
to restoring the landmark VRA and updating 
its preclearance provision, which is crucial 
to prevent racial discrimination in the vot-
ing process. VRA restoration is being pur-
sued on a separate legislative track that will 
involve investigatory and evidentiary hear-
ings, thus enabling Congress to update the 
preclearance coverage formula and develop a 
full record on the continuing problem of ra-
cial discrimination in voting. In 2006, the 
VRA was reauthorized on a unanimous vote 
in the Senate and a near-unanimous vote in 
the House. We need the same type of broad 
and bipartisan support for restoring the VRA 
today. 
H.R. 1 would also make significant ad-
vances in the areas of campaign finance and 
ethics reform. It would correct the rampant 
corruption flowing from the corrosive power 
of money in our elections. It would replace 
the current campaign finance system that 
empowers the super-rich and big corpora-
tions with one that relies on small donors 
and public matching funds. It would end se-
cret election spending and force disclosure of 
all election-related spending. And it would 
call for a constitutional amendment to over-
turn the disturbing Citizens United decision 
that made it impossible to restrict outside 
spending by corporations or billionaires. In 
addition, H.R. 1 addresses our government 
ethics crisis by, among other things, requir-
ing the development of a code of conduct for 
Supreme Court Justices to enhance account-
ability on ethics and recusal issues; over-
hauling the Office of Government Ethics to 
strengthen federal ethics oversight; estab-
lishing more robust conflict of interest re-
quirements for government officials; prohib-
iting members of Congress from using tax-
payer dollars to settle allegations of employ-
ment discrimination; and requiring presi-
dents to disclose their tax returns. 
The For the People Act provides a North 
Star for the democracy reform agenda. It is 
a bold, comprehensive reform package that 
offers solutions to a broken democracy. Re-
pairing and modernizing our voting system 
goes hand in hand with reforms that address 
the rampant corruption flowing from the 
corrosive power of money in our elections, 
and reforms that address the myriad ethical 
problems that plague all three branches of 
the federal government. The reforms in the 
For the People Act are necessary to advance 
racial justice and ensure that our govern-
ment works for all people, not just a power-
ful few. 
Congress must also pass two other essen-
tial racial justice and democracy reform 
bills: the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act—which would restore a crit-
ical provision of the Voting Rights Act gut-
ted by the Supreme Court’s infamous 2013 
Shelby County v. Holder decision—and the 
Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which 
would grant long overdue statehood status 
to the nation’s capital. 
Shortly before his death last year, Rep-
resentative Lewis remarked: ‘‘In our coun-
try, the right to vote is precious—almost sa-
cred. Countless people marched and pro-
tested for this right. Some gave a little 
blood, and far too many lost their lives. 
Around the globe, generations of U.S. offi-
cials boasted of this legacy and progress. 
Today, the world is horrified in watching 
Americans—especially people of color—once 
again stand in immovable lines and experi-
ence undeniable, targeted, systematic bar-
riers to democracy . . . . Time is of the es-
sence to preserve the integrity and promises 
of our democracy.’’ 
Congress and the Biden-Harris administra-
tion must heed this call. As the 2020 election 
cycle and the recent violent assault on the 
U.S. Capitol made abundantly clear, our de-
mocracy is vulnerable and is in dire need of 
protection. We must enact transformational 
change to build a democracy that works for 
everyone. The civil and human rights coali-
tion is strongly committed to expanding the 
franchise and fixing our democracy, and we 
urge both chambers of Congress to pass the 
For the People Act as early as possible in the 
117th Congress.

strengthen our democracy by making it easi-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H983 
March 2, 2021 
introduced to restrict voting access—four 
times the number of similar bills introduced 
last year. This new push for voter suppres-
sion follows the 2020 election, where a record 
number of Americans exercised their right to 
vote. Offering Americans new and convenient 
methods of voting, including expanded ab-
sentee and mail-in voting options, had the 
dual benefits of protecting the public health 
during the COVID–19 pandemic and enabling 
greater turnout. 
Despite confirmation by former Attorney 
General Barr and others that there was no 
evidence of widespread fraud or irregularity 
in the 2020 election, state legislators have 
seized upon former President Trump’s base-
less voter-fraud allegations to curtail mail- 
in voting options, impose stringent voter ID 
requirements, limit voter registration oppor-
tunities, and allow even more aggressive 
purging of voter rolls. In the wake of a safe 
and secure election, which enabled greater 
levels of voter participation than in over a 
century, we should be building on this 
progress, not dismantling it. 
The Act includes several measures that 
would neutralize these cynical efforts at 
voter suppression by improving access to the 
ballot. Voters in many states face the frus-
trations of antiquated, error-ridden voter 
registration systems; the Act would mod-
ernize voter registration by requiring states 
to implement online registration, establish 
automatic voter registration, and prohibit 
unnecessary purges of the voting rolls. The 
Act also addresses discriminatory voter iden-
tification laws by requiring states to permit 
voters in federal elections to submit a sworn 
statement to meet ID requirements. Early 
voting provisions contained in the Act would 
expand access to federal elections by pro-
viding for at least 15 days of early voting at 
accessible locations and making available 
the option to vote by mail to anyone eligible 
to cast a vote in an election for federal of-
fice. Although the States’ election laws vary, 
we have broad collective experience with the 
implementation of similar voting-access re-
forms and do not anticipate that the Act’s 
mandates would prove overly burdensome to 
implement. 
Critically, the Act would also confront the 
problem of partisan gerrymandering by put-
ting redistricting in the hands of inde-
pendent commissions. The threat of severe 
gerrymandering in the post-2020 redistricting 
process is especially acute given the Su-
preme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. 
Holder, which effectively eliminated the 
preclearance protections contained in Sec-
tion 5 of the Voting Rights Act (‘‘VRA’’). 
Without the preclearance restraints of the 
VRA and the corresponding oversight from 
the Department of Justice, there is a sub-
stantial risk that states with a history of ra-
cial discrimination will seek to minimize the 
political power of minority voters by draw-
ing aggressive congressional district lines. 
By divesting redistricting power from politi-
cians who manipulate the process to consoli-
date power, the Act will ensure that voters 
choose their representatives, not the other 
way around. 
As the chief law enforcement officers of 
our respective states, we are well-acquainted 
with schemes to discourage, impede, and pre-
vent our citizens from voting. In the lead up 
to November’s election, disinformation de-
signed to depress voter turnout was endemic, 
spread by bad actors through social media, 
robocalls, and texts. Thankfully, the fear of 
widespread, aimed intimidation at polling 
places did not materialize last year. That 
possibility, however, looms in future elec-
tions—especially once election day turnout 
is no longer diminished due to an ongoing 
pandemic. By prohibiting the knowing dis-
semination of materially false information 
about elections and stiffening penalties for 
voter intimidation, the Act will provide law 
enforcement officials with the tools needed 
to thwart and punish those who attempt to 
interfere with the exercise of the funda-
mental right to vote. 
The Act also contains important changes 
to campaign finance law designed to address 
the concerning rise of dark money in federal 
elections. Since the Supreme Court’s ruling 
in Citizens United v. FEC, dark money has 
flooded political campaigns at unprecedented 
levels. As a result, billionaires, corporations, 
and special interest groups—groups that al-
ready had outsized voices in our political 
process—now wield even more power, often 
exercising that power anonymously through 
opaque ‘‘non-profits’’ that are not required 
to disclose their donors. The Act would close 
dark-money loopholes by requiring disclo-
sure when wealthy donors give $10,000 or 
more to a group that spends money on elec-
tions. As the Supreme Court has explained, 
‘‘transparency enables the electorate to 
make informed decisions and give proper 
weight to different speakers and messages.’’ 
Bringing sunlight to political contributions 
is a crucial step to restoring faith in govern-
ment. 
Last but certainly not least, the Act seeks 
to close a number of legal loopholes—re-
vealed in striking and disturbing ways dur-
ing former President Trump’s term in of-
fice—that allow the President to evade ac-
countability for personally profiting from 
the Office. In particular, the Act heightens 
disclosure requirements applicable to the 
president, requires the holder of the Office of 
the President to divest from financial inter-
ests that pose a conflict of interest, and en-
sures accountability by providing the Office 
of Government Ethics with enhanced en-
forcement powers. Surprising gaps in the 
ethics laws affecting non-presidential public 
servants would also be closed. For instance, 
the Act would prohibit members of Congress 
from serving on the board of directors of for- 
profit entities during their terms in office 
and, for the first time, require the Judicial 
Conference to develop a code of ethics appli-
cable to Supreme Court Justices. Collec-
tively, the ethics reforms contained in the 
Act would ensure that our public servants 
are working on behalf of America’s best in-
terests, not just their own. 
American democracy needs repairing. The 
problems we face—outdated election infra-
structure, unjustified barriers to voting, ex-
treme gerrymandering, the polluting influ-
ence of dark money, and insufficient ethical 
constraints-urgently need addressing. We be-
lieve that the Act represents an important 
step toward addressing these problems and 
urge its swift passage.

Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES), who is the 
author of H.R. 1. 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank madam chair, ZOE LOFGREN, for 
her incredible work on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1, the For the People Act, 
a bill that was designed to respond to 
the deep cynicism so many Americans 
feel when they look at their democracy 
and wonder if their voice still matters 
in it. 
We heard many grievances from 
Americans across the country over the 
last few years, but they fall into three 
basic categories. The first was, they 
kept saying to us: We want to get to 
the ballot box every 2 years without 
having to run an obstacle course. 
We should be the gold standard 
among our peer nations when it comes 
to voting, but we haven’t reached that 
point yet. H.R. 1 creates that oppor-
tunity. 
By the way, let me thank the Repub-
lican voters across the country who, in 
the last election, used automatic voter 
registration where it existed, used 
early voting opportunities where that 
was afforded, and used a no-excuse ab-
sentee ballot to cast their ballot in the 
midst of a pandemic. To Republican 
voters, Independent voters, and Demo-
cratic voters this is not controversial. 
We are just trying to create some 
baseline, uniform standards and best 
practices so people can get to the bal-
lot box. When they get up in the morn-
ing and they have decided that is the 
day they are going to go vote, it 
shouldn’t be a trial to get to the voting 
booth and to the ballot box. That is all 
we are trying to do. That is not con-
troversial, and that is not partisan out 
in the country. Maybe here it is, but 
not out in the country. 
The second thing they said to us is: 
When you get to Washington, behave 
yourself, act right, act ethically, be 
transparent, and be accountable. 
So we have a whole set of reforms in 
here that are designed to do that. 
The third thing they have been plead-
ing with us about is: Don’t get tangled 
up in the money. Remember where you 
came from and remember who you 
work for. Lean towards the people and 
not towards the special interests, the 
deep-pocketed donors, the insider polit-
ical donor class, the big money, the 
PACs, the super-PACs, and the lobby-
ists. Work for us, the people. 
So we are trying to address that in 
H.R. 1. None of these things is con-
troversial. The only controversy is how 
it has taken us this long to address 
these grievances that people feel across 
the country. H.R. 1, the For the People 
Act, is our opportunity to do that. 
Why is it a whole package? 
Sometimes people say: Well, we are 
going to take this piece and take that 
piece. 
It is because the people told us—they 
were smart enough to know—if you fix 
one thing and you don’t fix the other 
thing, our voice still doesn’t matter. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H984 
March 2, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Maryland. 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, if 
you get fair elections in place but, 
when the Representatives get to Wash-
ington they get taken hostage by the 
special interests and still get influ-
enced by the big money, then you 
haven’t solved our problem as the 
American people who want our voice to 
be heard. So we have to do the whole 
package. 
Let me close with this. John Lewis, 
who is not with us anymore, fought for 
voting rights. He knew the vote was sa-
cred. He told us to keep our eyes on the 
prize. Today we do that. 
Elijah Cummings, whom I served 
with in Baltimore for many, many 
years, often told the story that on his 
mother’s deathbed she beckoned him 
close, and the last thing she said to 
him was: Don’t let them take the vote. 
We are not going to let them take 
the vote. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CREN-
SHAW). 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 1. I 
have always found it interesting that 
elections are the one thing my col-
leagues on the other side don’t want to 
strictly regulate. 
You see, Madam Speaker, there is 
this mythology amongst Democrats 
that commonsense rules in an election 
are synonymous with voter suppres-
sion. They make it sound as if you 
have to go through an obstacle course 
to go vote. This isn’t true. It is non-
sense, and everybody knows it. 
The truth is that four out of five 
Americans support voter ID laws, and 
countless Americans have expressed 
concern because they received mail-in 
ballots for other people addressed to 
their homes. They want this fixed, and 
they don’t want the problem to get 
worse. But this bill makes elections 
less trustworthy, not more. 
Trust is everything. When people can 
see the faults in the process, whether it 
is ballots at the wrong house or care-
less verification processes, they believe 
people are cheating. You can’t just dis-
miss that, Madam Speaker. We have to 
fix it. But instead this bill makes per-
manent the problematic election prac-
tices that cause distrust. 
For example, Madam Speaker, ballot 
harvesting creates serious chain of cus-
tody issues, and universal mail-in vot-
ing without safeguards creates the 
kind of chaos where your ballot ends 
up in someone else’s hands, as does 
forcing States to disregard their own 
voter ID laws and use sworn state-
ments instead of an ID. 
The integrity of our elections must 
be self-evident, wherein the mere possi-
bility of fraud is improbable because 
the process itself is airtight and secure. 
Many States today do not meet that 
standard. We should be working to-
gether to make elections more secure, 
not less. If that is indeed our mutual 
goal, and I pray that it is, then I im-
plore my colleagues to work with us. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may 
I ask how much time is remaining on 
each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 6 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Illinois has 7 minutes remaining. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), who 
is a member of the House Judiciary 
Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, over 
the last 30 years I have been a poll 
worker, an election judge, an election 
protection lawyer, and a civics educa-
tor working to protect the right to 
vote. 
I have seen firsthand the flaws in our 
system that prevent Americans from 
participating in our democracy. Voter 
suppression tactics, the influence of 
dark 
money, 
gerrymandering, 
and 
other anti-democratic practices have 
all disenfranchised voters. 
In my home State of Pennsylvania, 
voters have been victim of such tactics 
for years. But many Americans have 
made clear that we want a government 
for the people and by the people, and 
House Democrats are answering that 
call. 
I am particularly proud that my bills 
to increase access for voters with dis-
abilities, bring transparency to inau-
gural funds, and increase the avail-
ability of ballot drop boxes have all 
been included in this legislation. I am 
also hopeful that my amendment to in-
crease access to early voting for col-
lege students will also be included. 
H.R. 1 will strengthen our democracy 
and ensure that the power in our gov-
ernment rests with the people. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I do also have a stack 
of letters in opposition. I will include 
them in the RECORD. I won’t go 
through each of them. 
FRANK LAROSE, 
OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE, 
Columbus OH, 
For Immediate Release: 
Thursday, February 25, 2021. 
LAROSE CALLS ON CONGRESS TO REJECT 
FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF ELECTIONS 
House Resolution 1 Would Bring Sweeping, 
Unworkable and Unfunded Change Across 
the Nation’s 50 Unique Election Systems, 
Causing Chaos and Damaging Voter Con-
fidence 
COLUMBUS.—Today, 
Ohio 
Secretary 
of 
State Frank LaRose called on the United 
States Congress to vote against House Reso-
lution 1, a bill that would effectively take 
over control of how states conduct elections. 
HR 1 imposes significant changes that ignore 
both the United States Constitution and the 
unique election systems across the 50 states 
in an effort to standardize how states vote. 
‘‘Ohio’s November 2020 election was the 
most successful on record, but Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck 
Schumer want to wipe it all away with a 
massive power-grab,’’ said LaRose. ‘‘Remem-
ber, each state election system is unique— 
shaped by time and trusted by their respec-
tive voters. Forcing uniform standards, pro-
cedures, and expectations into state election 
systems, some far different than others and 
not built for those requirements, is like forc-
ing a square peg into a round hole. It won’t 
work.’’ 
Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution 
states that ‘‘[t]he Times, Places and Manner 
of holding Elections for Senators and Rep-
resentatives, shall be prescribed in each 
State by the Legislature thereof,’’ but that 
‘‘the Congress may at any time by Law make 
or alter such Regulations, except as to the 
Places of chusing Senators.’’ In Federalist 
Paper No. 59, Alexander Hamilton contended 
that such regulation was only necessary 
‘‘whenever 
extraordinary 
circumstances 
might render that interposition necessary to 
its safety’’. Moreso, state-level elections and 
the election of the president have remained 
outside of the purview of congress. 
However, the question of whether it’s even 
within the power of congress to take over 
how states run elections isn’t even the most 
important question. Instead, the better ques-
tion is ‘‘should they?’’ In the 59 presidential 
elections since 1789, each has resulted in the 
successful election of a President. Voting 
laws have evolved across the 50 states, pro-
viding more and more access, security, and 
accuracy. Over time, each of those same 50 
states have created their own unique elec-
tion systems. From who administers the 
elections, to how votes are cast, to how a 
vote is protected—each system was born of 
federalism. 
Like human beings, no voting system is 
perfect. Improvements and changes happen 
as the people, working through their respec-
tive state legislatures, see fit. In Ohio, a 
state whose elections have long been under 
the national spotlight, we’ve developed a 
system which has ensured voters have con-
fidence in the outcome of elections. As a re-
sult, voter turnout is at an all-time high, 
voter fraud and voter suppression are exceed-
ingly rare, and our efforts to strengthen the 
security of our elections have become a na-
tional model. Even as we faced enormous 
challenges, last year we in Ohio ran the most 
successful election in our state’s history. It’s 
no surprise that other states are now coming 
to us to learn our best election practices so 
they can mirror them back home. 
That’s how it’s supposed to work. One of 
the great motivations of federalism is the 
state role as a laboratory for democracy, 
with each state innovating to become a bet-
ter version of itself, and sharing those les-
sons with other states. That experiment has 
allowed our nation to become the best in the 
world. We need to keep that experiment 
going and encourage Ohio’s congressional 
delegation to vote against House Resolution 
1. 
Secretary LaRose will soon be sending a 
letter to congressional leadership and Ohio’s 
congressional delegation requesting a no 
vote on HR 1.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
MCCONNELL, MINORITY
LEADER
MCCARTHY, 
MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER, CHAIRMAN NAD-
LER, CHAIRMAN GRAHAM, RANKING MEMBER 
JORDAN, AND RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN: On 
behalf of the undersigned state Attorneys 
General, we write to respectfully urge Con-
gress to address the ongoing, declining bal-
ance of the Crime Victims Fund (‘‘the 
Fund’’). The Fund provides critical support 
and services to victims of crime across the 
country. As state Attorneys General, we are 
often the administrators of grant funding, 
through our state compensation programs or 
otherwise, financed directly from the Fund. 
In order to ensure the predictability and sus-
tainability of these critical funds, change 
must be enacted to support our states’ abil-
ity to effectively serve victims and survivors 
of crime for years to come. 
The Fund, established by the Victims of 
Crime Act of 1984 (‘‘VOCA’’), is the primary 
funding source for victim services in all 50 
states and six U.S. territories. Deposits to 
the Fund originate from criminal fines, for-
feited bail bonds, penalties and special as-
sessments collected by U.S. Attorneys’ Of-
fices, federal courts and the Federal Bureau 
of Prisons. Funding is derived from offenders 
convicted of federal crimes, and not from 
taxpayers. 
Since its creation, the Fund has covered 
the expenses of essential direct services and 
support for victims and survivors in the 
aftermath of crime, including medical care, 
mental health counseling, lost wages, court-
room advocacy and temporary housing. The 
Fund also provides support for initiatives 
that benefit victims of crime, including fed-
eral, state and tribal victim service pro-
grams, crime victim compensation, discre-
tionary grant awards, victim specialists in 
U.S. Attorneys’ and FBI offices and the fed-
eral victim notification system. Addition-
ally, grants through the Fund are the only 
funding source available for services to all 
victims of crime. 
The balance and financial health of the 
Fund is in jeopardy. As deposits have sharply 
decreased in recent years due to a decline in 
the fines and penalties recouped from federal 
criminal cases, withdrawals have increased 
at a rapid pace. In 2015, Congress increased 
the annual cap on distributions from the 
Fund, resulting in significant growth in the 
amount of services offered across the coun-
try. Nearly 2,500 new organizations received 
VOCA funding since 2015. In addition, more 
than 2.5 million new victims were served 
through VOCA assistance formula grants 
from 2015 to 2019. 
We applaud Congress for expanding access 
to victim services. Yet, these important ad-
vances are at risk given the current down-
ward trajectory of the Fund’s balance. Its 
balance is projected to reach a ten-year low 
by the end of 2021 unless specific changes are 
enacted to protect its bottom line. Any de-
crease in the funds available for distribution 
results in a decrease in the number of vic-
tims and survivors that are served as well as 
potential loss of essential staff for victim 
service programs. 
In order to stabilize and maintain the 
Fund for use in the future, we respectfully 
request Congress amend VOCA in the fol-
lowing three ways: 
Deposit all monetary penalties from de-
ferred and non-prosecution agreements into 
the Crime Victims Fund. 
Over the last decade, the Department of 
Justice has increasingly utilized deferred 
and non-prosecution agreements to resolve 
cases of corporate misconduct. These agree-
ments bypass a traditional prosecution proc-
ess and shift fines and penalties into the gen-
eral treasury rather than the Fund. In 2018 
and 2019, the total recoveries resulting from 
these agreements resulted in approximately 
$8 billion each year. Redirecting these depos-
its will provide increased funding to the 
Fund, which will allow for better predict-
ability of state awards. 
Increase the rate at which states are feder-
ally reimbursed for victim compensation 
programs to 75 percent. 
The Fund supports state compensation 
programs, which provide direct reimburse-
ment to or on behalf of crime victims for un-
expected and often catastrophic expenses 
caused by violent crime. In order to supple-
ment a state’s efforts to financially assist 
victims for crime-related out-of-pocket ex-
penses, the Fund reimburses states 60 per-
cent of spending in a fiscal year. Most states’ 
compensation programs are funded through 
fines and fees paid by offenders prosecuted in 
state courts. Recently, due to criminal jus-
tice reform initiatives along with court clo-
sures due to the COVID–19 pandemic, states 
are facing a significant decline in collections 
of these fines and fees, limiting their ability 
to support essential victim compensation el-
igible expenses. An increase in the reim-
bursement rate from the Fund to at least 75 
percent will ensure each state has more 
money accessible to serve victims and sur-
vivors with much needed financial support. 
Allow for additional years of spending or 
no-cost extensions for VOCA discretionary, 
assistance and compensation awards. 
Current statutory limitations require that 
recipients of VOCA funds spend annual 
grants in a four-year period. To reduce rever-
sions and provide better forecasting for pro-
gramming, the statute should allow for 
longer periods to spend down grants and 
allow the Office for Victims of Crime to per-
mit no-cost extensions to states. A longer 
award period allows administrators to better 
plan and predict funding awards and long- 
term services. In times of economic uncer-
tainty, such as the COVID–19 pandemic, this 
is especially important as state budgets and 
other funding sources are significantly im-
pacted. Additional time also allows for redi-
rection of funds for emergency assistance 
without the threat of compromising tradi-
tional services. 
Your support of the Crime Victims Fund is 
paramount to our responsibility as Attor-
neys General to protect the interests of vic-
tims. As such, we defer to you on the best ve-
hicle to introduce the above changes. We do 
ask, however, that Congress make them a 
key priority and act upon all three swiftly. 
Thank you for your attention and consid-
eration of this matter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H986 
March 2, 2021 
P&As were established by the United States 
Congress to protect the rights of people with 
disabilities and their families through legal 
support, advocacy, referral, and education. 
P&As are in all 50 states, the District of Co-
lumbia, Puerto Rico, and the US territories 
(American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana 
Islands, and the US Virgin Islands), and 
there is a P&A affiliated with the American 
Indian Consortium which serves Native 
Americans with disabilities in the Four Cor-
ners region of the Southwest. Collectively, 
the P&A Network is the largest provider of 
legally based advocacy services to people 
with disabilities in the United States. 
Through the Protection and Advocacy for 
Voter Access (PAVA) program, created by 
the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), the 
P&As have a federal mandate to ensure the 
full participation of individuals with disabil-
ities in the entire electoral process, includ-
ing registering to vote, casting a ballot, and 
accessing polling places. PAVA advocates 
are on the ground in communities and 
states, providing advice, technical assist-
ance, and training to election officials about 
voting accessibility for a wide array of dis-
abilities. They also provide outreach, train-
ing, and direct representation to individuals 
with disabilities, and the agencies and orga-
nizations that serve them. 
Voters with disabilities remain a large vot-
ing bloc in America’s elections. The United 
States Census Bureau has reported up to 56.7 
million people with disabilities live in the 
community, totaling approximately 19 per-
cent of the non-institutionalized US popu-
lation. The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) and Pew Research Center 
believe that number is closer to 25 percent, 
or one in four Americans. Further, the 
School of Management and Labor Relations 
at Rutgers University projected that there 
were 38.3 million people with disabilities eli-
gible to vote in the US, one-sixth of the total 
American electorate, during the 2020 elec-
tions. 
The disability community is diverse and 
people with disabilities are a part of every 
community. 
People 
who 
identify 
as 
LGBTQIA+ are more likely to have a dis-
ability. A quarter or more of American Indi-
ans/Alaska Natives and Black adults have a 
disability. People with disabilities are dis-
proportionately low-income, and are unem-
ployed, underemployed, or not participating 
in the workforce at a rate of approximately 
three-fourths of adults with disabilities, 
under the age of 65 living in the community. 
Despite the size and diversity of the dis-
ability community, America’s electoral sys-
tem remains largely inaccessible and has a 
long history of excluding people with disabil-
ities. Inaccessible polling places, voting sta-
tions and vote by mail systems are only 
some of the barriers voters with disabilities 
face while trying to exercise their right to 
vote in America every election cycle. In Feb-
ruary 2021, the Election Assistance Commis-
sion (EAC) and Rutgers University released 
their report, ‘‘Disability and Voting Accessi-
bility in the 2020 Elections’’, which summa-
rized their survey results from last year’s 
election cycle. The results found that ‘‘one 
in nine voters with disabilities encountered 
difficulties voting in 2020,’’ twice the rate of 
people without disabillties. The report also 
found that 18 percent of people with disabil-
ities who voted in person last year had dif-
ficulty with voting compared to 10 percent of 
people without disabilities, while five per-
cent of voters with disabilities had difficul-
ties using a mail ballot, compared to two 
percent of voters without disabilities. 
Despite the fact that the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law 
now almost 31 years ago, requiring America’s 
polling places be accessible to voters with 
disabilities, the majority of polling places 
remain inaccessible. The US Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) surveys of polling 
place accessibility span 20 years. In 2000, 
GAO data indicated that only 16 percent of 
polling places had an accessible path of trav-
el from the parking area to the voting booth. 
This percentage has slowly but steadily in-
creased to 27 percent in 2008 and to 40 percent 
in 2016. To be clear, 40 percent is an all-time 
high in architectural access, meaning that 
less than half of polling places were compli-
ant with federal law during the 2016 presi-
dential election. 
Worse, GAO began to investigate the acces-
sibility of voting stations within polling 
places starting with the 2008 study, during 
which only 54 percent of voting booths were 
determined to be accessible in 2016, the prev-
alence of accessible voting stations actually 
fell to a dismal 35 percent—a drop of 19 per-
centage points in just 2 presidential election 
cycles. GAO found that voting booths were 
less likely to be set up to ensure voter pri-
vacy, set up for wheelchair access, have 
headphones readily apparent for audio bal-
loting, or even be turned on for voters to use. 
In their 2016 findings, GAO combined archi-
tectural access data with voting booth data 
for the first time and reported an aston-
ishing 17 percent of polling places are com-
pliant with federal law and fully accessible 
for voters with disabilities—fewer than 1 in 
5. 
Along with inaccessible polling places and 
inaccessible voting stations, vote by mail 
systems are not, and have never been, acces-
sible to all voters with disabilities. People 
who are blind or low vision, have print dis-
abilities, limited literacy, limited manual 
dexterity, and other disabilities cannot pri-
vately and independently mark, verify, and 
cast a hand marked paper mail-in ballot. 
Federal law is clear that any option made 
available to voters must be accessible for 
people with disabilities, including vote by 
mail. 
As Congress continues to explore voting 
legislation to strengthen American democ-
racy, we urge you to protect the rights of 
voters with disabilities. Legislation cur-
rently being considered in the 117th Con-
gress, such as H.R. 1, the For the People Act, 
which includes several provisions that will 
positively impact voters with disabilities. 
However, it must be understood that the 
paper ballot mandate included in the bill is 
of great concern to many voters with disabil-
ities. 
Paper-based voting options have become 
the preferred voting system to many who be-
lieve mandating the use of paper ballots is 
necessary to ensure the security of our elec-
tions. However, it must be made abundantly 
clear, that the ability to mark, verify, and 
cast a paper ballot privately and independ-
ently is currently not an option for all vot-
ers. 
Given that paper ballots are already the 
predominant method of casting a ballot in 
America today with extremely few excep-
tions, mandating paper ballots is frankly un-
necessary. A federal mandate for paper bal-
lots that are already being used will not 
change how we currently administer elec-
tions in the United States or make our elec-
tions any more secure. Additionally, any 
mandate of a paper-based voting system will 
inevitably create barriers for voters with dis-
abilities. A paper ballot mandate would: 1.) 
end all voting system innovation and ad-
vancement to produce a fully accessible vot-
ing system that provides enhanced security 
without relying on archaic, inaccessible 
paper; 2.) limit voters with disabilities’ fed-
eral right to privately and independently 
verify and cast their ballots, and 3.) ulti-
mately segregate voters with disabilities. 
Further, any paper ballot mandate that en-
titles voters to a hand marked ballot threat-
ens the availability of Ballot-Marking De-
vices (BMDs) for voters who rely on them to 
mark their ballots by drastically limiting 
use of BMDs to voters with disabilities. This 
would result in segregating voters with dis-
abilities away from the entire pool of voters 
by making them the only group of people 
that use a particular type of voting machine. 
Federally mandated segregation is problem-
atic alone, but in practice, it also increases 
the likelihood that poll workers will not be 
properly trained on the machine, the ma-
chines will not be properly maintained or set 
up for use, and if the only available BMD is 
not functioning, there is no alternative op-
tion for voters who need it. Limits on BMD 
use will also saddle poll workers with deter-
mining who is ‘‘disabled enough’’ to use the 
BMD, a decision for which they have no 
qualifications or legal right. Finally, if the 
ballot produced by the BMD is not identical 
to the hand marked ballot or the BMD ballot 
cannot be scanned and stored with hand 
marked ballots, the voter’s right to cast a 
private ballot is violated. 
To be clear, no paper ballot voting system 
today, ready for widespread use, is fully ac-
cessible. Even BMDs require voters with dis-
abilities to verify and a cast a paper-based 
ballot, which does not ensure a private and 
independent vote. A fully accessible voting 
system by Federal law must ensure the voter 
can receive, mark, verify, and cast the ballot 
without having to directly visually inspect 
or handle paper. Most, if not all, market- 
ready voting systems cannot do this. Before 
paper-based voting systems become the law 
of the land, the concerns of voters with dis-
abilities must be addressed. 
Moving forward NDRN calls on Congress to 
continue to examine and pass legislation 
that protects the rights of all voters, includ-
ing voters with disabilities. This includes, 
but is not limited to, Congress accepting its 
role in providing a continual funding stream 
to state and local election officials for the 
purpose of making electoral processes fully 
accessible. Congress must invest in research 
and development and pilot projects, as well 
as funding to states for the purchase of new 
accessible voting equipment. Congress may 
also consider expanding the role of the U.S. 
Election Assistance Commission to address 
accessible remote voting in its creation of 
voting system guidelines and by adding full 
time staff and additional seats on its advi-
sory boards for experts in elections accessi-
bility with a focus on voters with disabil-
ities. Rather than overly prescriptive, blan-
ket mandates that create barriers for eligi-
ble voters, our focus must be on fostering in-
novative solutions that make our elections 
more accessible and more secure through re-
sponsible use of technology. 
NDRN thanks Congress for prioritizing 
strengthening American democracy and we 
look forward to working with you to ensure 
every voice, including the voice of the dis-
ability community, is heard on Election 
Day. 
Sincerely, 
CURTIS L. DECKER, 
Executive Director.

JOHN H. MERRILL, 
SECRETARY OF STATE, 
Montgomery, AL, February 22, 2021. 
Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL,

Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader of the House, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, MINOR-
ITY
LEADER
MCCONNELL, SPEAKER
PELOSI, 
AND HOUSE MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY: We 
are writing you today to urge you to reject 
the ‘‘For the People Act’’ otherwise known 
as H.R. 1 or S. 1, which is a dangerous over-
reach by the federal government into the ad-
ministration of elections. 
Each state legislature should have the 
freedom and flexibility to determine prac-
tices that best meet the needs of their re-
spective states. A one-size-fits-all approach 
mandated by Congress is not the solution to 
any of our problems. 
These bills intrude upon our constitutional 
rights, and further sacrifice the security and 
integrity of the elections process. We firmly 
believe the authority to legislate and regu-
late these changes should be left with the 
states. 
H.R. 1 and S. 1 blatantly undermine the ex-
tensive work we, as election officials, have 
completed in order to provide safe, accessible 
voting options for our constituencies. Many 
of the proposed practices would reverse the 
years of progress that has been made. We are 
strongly opposed to these bills and hope you 
will dismiss efforts to advance this legisla-
tion. 
Thank you for your consideration and at-
tention to this matter, 
John H. Merrill, Alabama Secretary of 
State; Kevin Meyer, Alaska Lieutenant Gov-
ernor; Brad Raffensperger, Georgia Secretary 
of State; Lawrence Denney, Idaho Secretary

OHIO HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
SCOTT
WIGGAM, 
STATE
REP-
RESENTATIVE, 
February 25, 2021. 
To: Ohio Federal Delegation 
From: Ohio Representative Scott Wiggam, 
District 1, Ohio House of Representatives 
TO
THE OHIO FEDERAL DELEGATION: As a 
state legislator elected to be a voice for the 
people of Ohio, I write to express my opposi-
tion to H.R. 1/S. 1, an unconstitutional take-
over of citizens’ right to free speech and as-
sociation. 
As elected officials, we both have a duty to 
represent our constituents best interests and 
a responsibility to defend the United States 
Constitution. Therefore, it is my obligation 
to urge you to oppose the deceptively named 
‘‘For the People Act.’’ The legislation is ill- 
considered and deeply unconstitutional, and 
I have seen firsthand the chilling effects of 
the donor disclosure provisions that it would 
enact. 
As a member of the American Legislative 
Exchange Council, a membership organiza-
tion of state legislators dedicated to prin-
ciples of limited government, free markets 
and federalism. In 2013, activists launched a 
campaign to reveal, then harass and shame, 
the ALEC donor base. Their goal was simple: 
Harassing ALEC donors and corporate mem-
bers would chill their participation with and 
support for the organization, ultimately cut-
ting off a funding source for ALEC. 
Worse, public elected officials used their 
platform to heighten this threat of donor 
disclosure in order to further intimidate 
ALEC supporters. In 2013, every company 
tangentially associated with ALEC received 
an official letter from US Senator Richard 
Durbin, demanding to know whether it had 
‘‘served as a member of ALEC or provided 
any funding to ALEC,’’ with the intent of in-
timidating them. Durbin wrote that he 
would read their responses into the official 
Congressional record, forever memorializing 
their support and creating a public target 
list for activists opposed to the organization. 
Even the Chicago Tribune, the Senator’s 
hometown newspaper that had endorsed his 
candidacy, rebuked Durbin’s attempt at cre-
ating an ‘‘enemies list’’ by using ‘‘his high 
federal office as a cudgel against his en-
emies.’’ 
H.R. 1/S. 1 would institutionalize this har-
assment and intimidation and extend it to 
all nonprofits, regardless of their issue area 
or political persuasion. Whatever issues you 
support or oppose, this should be of serious 
concern to you. If this legislation is enacted, 
passionate activists on both sides of the aisle 
would have access to a government-run data-
base of donors who give to every organiza-
tion from ALEC and the Family Research 
Council to the ACLU and Planned Parent-
hood. Does anyone doubt that the blunt in-
strument of donor disclosure in H.R. 1/S. 1 
would put millions of Americans’ peace and 
livelihoods at risk of significant, material 
harm? 
These tactics are flimsy bureaucratic 
structures designed to harass nonprofits and 
chill speech, despite fundamental violations 
of the First Amendment. In keeping with to-
day’s ‘‘cancel culture,’’ H.R. 1/S. 1 is a gov-
ernment-sanctioned attempt to chill speech 
and 
participation. 
‘‘Good 
governance’’ 
watchdogs argue this measure increases 
‘‘transparency.’’ Transparency is good when 
applied to government, but when it strips 
away Constitutionally protected privacy for 
individuals, it is exceedingly dangerous. For 
the federal government to expose our con-
stituents as supporters of any nonprofit’s 
cause would be an enormous overreach of 
centralized power. 
If passed, the donor disclosure provisions 
in H.R. 1/S. 1 would bludgeon our democratic 
institutions and threaten the safety and 
peace of our everyday constituents. It would 
further normalize the darkness of ‘‘cancel 
culture’’ and intimidation through overregu-
lation in American society. Therefore, we 
call on you to oppose H.R./S. 1. 
Sincerely, 
Representative SCOTT WIGGAM, 
District 1, Ohio House of Representatives, 
Ohio ALEC State Chair.

OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL, 
Washington, DC, August 10, 2020. 
Re Support for the Edith Shorougian Senior 
Victims of Fraud Compensation Act (S. 
3487/H.R. 7620).

DEAR
LEADER
MCCONNELL, 
SPEAKER 
PELOSI, LEADER SCHUMER, LEADER MCCAR-
THY, CHAIR GRAHAM, CHAIR NADLER, RANKING 
MEMBER FEINSTEIN, AND RANKING MEMBER 
JORDAN: As our jurisdictions’ chief legal offi-
cers, we are writing to request the inclusion 
of the Edith Shorougian Senior Victims of 
Fraud Compensation Act (S. 3487/H.R. 7620) 
in COVID–19 relief legislation. This bipar-
tisan legislation, also known as ‘‘Edith’s 
Bill,’’ would amend the Victims of Crime Act 
of 1984 (VOCA) to include victims of senior 
fraud as eligible for reimbursement by the 
Crime Victims Fund for states that provide 
compensation to victims. This bill will also 
amend VOCA so that penalties and fines 
from deferred prosecution and non-prosecu-
tion agreements, which can include white 
collar criminal conduct against seniors, are 
deposited into the Crime Victims Fund. We 
support inclusion of the full bill in COVID–19 
relief legislation. 
Scam artists know that seniors are espe-
cially at risk from COVID–19 and are exploit-
ing the anxiety around this pandemic. They 
are targeting seniors who are isolating at 
home and are separated from their families 
and support networks. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services Office of Inspector General has 
warned that fraudsters ‘‘are offering COVID– 
19 tests to Medicare beneficiaries in ex-
change for personal details, including Medi-
care information.’’ This is unfortunately just 
one of many COVID–19 scams targeting sen-
iors. 
Senior fraud scams can be devastating on a 
personal and financial level. The Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau estimated in 
2019 that elder financial exploitation cases 
resulted in an average loss of over $40,000 and 
7% of cases resulted in a senior losing over 
$100,000. Many seniors live on fixed incomes 
and savings earned over a lifetime of hard 
work. Older adults have contributed so much 
to our nation, and it is simply wrong that 
many are losing life savings to criminals. 
Tragically, it is rare for seniors to receive 
compensation 
even 
after 
fraudsters 
are 
caught and convicted. Edith’s Bill would 
take an important step in providing com-
pensation to defrauded seniors, and it would 
do so without using taxpayer funds. 
Throughout the country, attorneys general 
are fighting senior fraud and abuse. In 2019, 
several state attorneys general partnered 
with the U.S. Department of Justice and

other federal partners to conduct the larg-
est-ever 
nationwide 
elder 
fraud 
sweep 
against perpetrators who had repeatedly tar-
geted seniors, resulting in losses of over $750 
million. Though this initiative was a tre-
mendous success, the total annual financial 
loss by elder abuse victims is estimated to be 
well over $2.6 billion. 
Further, with 1 in 5 Americans expected to 
be over the age of 65 by 2030, an increase in 
scams and frauds targeting seniors is widely 
expected. In Wisconsin alone, the number of 
reported elder abuse cases has already more 
than tripled since 2001. Edith Shorougian 
was one of those Wisconsin victims. Edith 
was scammed out of more than $80,000 by her 
longtime financial adviser. By using this leg-
islation to add senior fraud as an eligible re-
imbursement expense under VOCA, states 
will be able to help victims like Edith re-
ceive the financial relief they deserve. States 
would be incentivized but not mandated by 
this legislation to provide compensation to 
victims of senior fraud.

FEBRUARY 9, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Republican Leader, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, REPUBLICAN LEADER 
MCCARTHY, MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, AND 
REPUBLICAN LEADER MCCONNELL: We write 
out of deep concern for the threat that the 
self-styled ‘‘For the People Act’’ (H.R. 1 and 
S. 1 in the current Congress, hereinafter the 
‘‘FPA’’) poses to the long-standing bipar-
tisan structure of the Federal Election Com-
mission (‘‘FEC’’)—a concern based on our 
many years of experience as commissioners 
of the FEC. The FEC is the federal agency 
entrusted with primary interpretation, civil 
enforcement, and administration of federal 
campaign finance laws. 
The threat to bipartisanship in this federal 
agency should be a concern for the public, 
but also for members of Congress, who are 
among the most visible subjects of FEC scru-
tiny. Candidates for federal office know that 
the FEC is an intrusive presence in virtually 
every aspect of their campaigns, requiring 
disclosure of detailed aspects of their con-
tributions and expenditures, initiating inves-
tigations, 
subpoenaing 
witnesses 
and 
records, imposing civil penalties for viola-
tions of its hundreds of pages of regulations, 
and conducting audits of campaign commit-
tees selected by the Commission to monitor 
compliance, among other actions. 
We are all former members of the FEC. 
Collectively, we have over six decades of 
service on the Commission. Most of us served 
as Chair of the FEC, and at least one of us 
was serving on the Commission at all times 
between 1998 and 2020. 
The FPA, as introduced in the House, is 791 
pages and addresses virtually every aspect of 
election rules and administration. Our com-
ments here are limited to Titles IV and VI in 
Division B of the Act. We address those pro-
visions because they concern the jurisdiction 
of the FEC, and our comments specifically 
represent our combined expertise and experi-
ence over decades of service on the Commis-
sion. Our decision not to address provisions 
of the FPA changing election administration 
outside of FEC jurisdiction, however, should 
not be viewed as support for or acquiescence 
in those proposals. 
Title VI would transform the FEC from a 
bipartisan, six-member body to a five-mem-
ber body subject to, and indeed designed for, 
partisan control. Proponents claim this rad-
ical change is necessary to prevent ‘‘dead-
lock’’ on the Commission and assure effi-
cient operations. This perception of per-
petual deadlock is incorrect. Empirically, 
even the most extreme study of FEC vote— 
that is, a vigorously contested, non-peer re-
viewed study, conducted during a short pe-
riod of relatively high disagreement within 
the Commission, and not transparent about 
its methodology or selection of votes—found 
a maximum of 30 percent of enforcement 
matters ending in 3–3 votes. But other stud-
ies, including peer-reviewed studies, have 
consistently found much lower rates of 
‘‘deadlock,’’ typically in the one to six per-
cent range. 
Moreover, the argument that the bipar-
tisan makeup of the Commission hinders its 
effectiveness is based on a misunderstanding 
of the FEC’s work and why deadlocks occa-
sionally occur. By definition, campaign fi-
nance law inserts the government into par-
tisan electoral disputes. In our experience, 
the 
agency’s 
bipartisan 
structure 
both 
assures that the laws are enforced with bi-
partisan support and equally important, that 
they are not perceived as a partisan tool of 
the majority party—an electoral weapon, if 
you will. ‘‘The indispensable ingredient in 
the FEC’s creation was its bipartisan make-
up,’’ with an equal number of members from 
each major party and a voting structure re-
quiring some minimal measure of bipartisan 
agreement before an enforcement action 
went forward or a rule was adopted. As Sen-
ator Alan Cranston (D–Calif.) explained dur-
ing post-Watergate Congressional debates 
about the agency’s creation: ‘‘We must not 
allow the FEC to become a tool for harass-
ment.’’ Political actors who violate cam-
paign finance laws, and their partisans, are 
often quick to denounce enforcement as a 
‘‘partisan witch hunt.’’ The FEC’s bipartisan 
makeup is a direct response to this claim 
and is fundamental to public confidence in 
the system. 
Further, a neutral examination of the rel-
atively few ‘‘deadlocks’’ that do occur re-
veals that a substantial portion of them con-
cern differences of opinion over the reach of 
the statutes the FEC enforces. One bloc of 
three commissioners has often reflected the 
views of activist organizations that advocate 
for even more extensive regulation, sup-
porting an expansive view of the statutes 
that goes beyond what Congress has enacted. 
In short, the complaints about ‘‘deadlocks’’ 
come from the regulatory activists who 
haven’t gotten their way. They now seek to 
change the bipartisan nature of the Commis-
sion, to smooth the path for agency adoption 
of the more expansive regulations they have 
unsuccessfully sought for years. Congress 
has consistently declined to adopt those ex-
pansive objectives. 
Similarly, in rule-making, the FEC’s bi-
partisan structure is a beneficial feature, not 
a defect. It demands that commissioners 
work to reach consensus and compromise on 
measures to achieve bipartisan support. If 
Congress wanted to destroy confidence in the 
fairness of American elections, it is hard to 
imagine a better first step than to eviscerate 
the FEC’s bipartisan structure. 
But Title VI goes further. First, it allows 
the Chair, who is appointed on a partisan 
basis by the President, to hire and fire the 
FEC’s General Counsel, a statutory position, 
with the support of just two commissioners. 
Thus, this crucial enforcement position can 
be filled with no bipartisan agreement, as 
the Chair, the other commissioner from that 
party, and an ‘‘independent’’ member ap-
pointed by a President of the Chair’s party, 
could make the decision. Further, it places 
sole authority to hire or fire the Commis-
sion’s Staff Director, also a statutory posi-
tion, in the hands of the FEC Chair, not even 
requiring the support of an independent com-
missioner. The Staff Director oversees the 
Commission’s Auditing, Reports Analysis, 
Administrative Fines, and Alternative Dis-
pute Resolution processes, which combined 
handle far more enforcement matters than 
the Office of General Counsel. Both the ap-
pearance and reality of bipartisanship in en-
forcement is fundamental to the FEC’s suc-
cess, and Title VI destroys both. 
The FPA also makes startling changes in 
the FEC’s enforcement processes, perhaps no 
more so than in § 6004 of Title VI. That sec-
tion provides that, in the event the Commis-
sion, after reviewing or investigating a com-
plaint, finds the respondent candidate, cam-
paign, or other entity did not violate the 
law, the complainant may sue in federal

court. There, the matter will be reviewed de 
novo, with no deference to the Commission’s 
findings of law or fact. If, however, the Com-
mission finds that the respondent did violate 
the law, and the respondent seeks to contest 
those findings in court, the Commission’s 
rulings will be afforded the traditional def-
erence given to administrative agencies by 
courts of law. In short, while the American 
justice system has traditionally erred in 
favor of the accused, so as to protect the in-
nocent and unjustly convicted, the FPA 
turns the formula on its head, explicitly 
biasing the judicial review process in favor 
of findings of guilt against candidates, cam-
paigns, and other defendants. 
Furthermore, Section 6004 allows for the 
appointed General Counsel to launch inves-
tigations and even determine matters of 
guilt or innocence without any majority 
vote of the Commission. It does this by 
sharply limiting the time the commissioners 
have to consider a matter, and then sub-
stituting the General Counsel’s verdict for a 
vote of the Commission. 
Other changes in Title VI to the Commis-
sion’s structure, enforcement, and regu-
latory processes are similarly ill-conceived. 
In addition to our concerns about Title VI, 
the FPA also includes a number of troubling, 
substantive changes to campaign finance 
law. Most notably, we reiterate the concerns 
previously expressed in 2010 by many of the 
signatories below regarding the ‘‘DISCLOSE 
Act,’’ included in Title IV, Subtitle B. The 
DISCLOSE Act is unnecessary, burdensome, 
and would stifle constitutionally protected 
political speech. 
Similarly, the ‘‘Stand by Every Ad Act’’ 
included in Title IV, Subtitle D would make 
disclaimer regulation more complex, have a 
chilling effect on speech, and provide little 
or no information that is not already avail-
able to the public under the Federal Election 
Campaign Act (‘‘FECA’’) and existing Com-
mission regulations. Indeed, in many cases, 
it would mislead the public as to the sources 
of an ad’s funding. 
Subtitles F and G of Title IV aim to af-
firmatively clear the way for the Internal 
Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) and the Securities 
and Exchange Commission to become in-
volved in campaign finance regulation. This 
is contrary to the design of the FECA, which 
gives the FEC primary civil enforcement re-
sponsibilities and exclusive authority for ad-
ministering and interpreting the Act. These 
other agencies do not have expertise in cam-
paign finance law. Attempting to use the 
IRS for campaign enforcement led to the 
scandal of 2013, which tarnished that agen-
cy’s reputation and public confidence in its 
operations. Inviting other non-expert agen-
cies into campaign finance enforcement 
would create a likelihood of inconsistent in-
terpretations and applications of the laws 
and increase the complexity of a regulatory 
system already famous for its intricacy. 
Based on our collective decades of experi-
ence at the FEC, we believe that these, and 
several other provisions of Titles IV and VI 
not specifically addressed here, would com-
plicate the law and hinder grassroots polit-
ical speech and activism, with little or no 
benefit 
to 
public 
accountability, 
trans-
parency, understanding of public policy, or 
reduction in corruption. 
Given these concerns, we are disturbed by 
recent news reports that House Leadership 
plans to bring H.R. 1 directly to the floor, 
bypassing committee consideration. We urge 
members of Congress in both chambers to de-
liberately and carefully consider this com-
plex, nearly 800-page legislation, with special 
attention paid to the bill’s harmful impact 
on First Amendment speech and association 
rights. 
Most importantly, we believe that Title 
VI, by shifting the Commission from a bipar-
tisan, six-member body to a five-member 
body subject to partisan control, would be 
highly detrimental to the agency’s credi-
bility. It would lead to more partisanship in 
enforcement and in regulatory matters, 
shattering public confidence in the decisions 
of the FEC. The Commission depends on bi-
partisan support and universal regard for the 
fairness of its actions. The FPA frustrates 
these goals with likely ruinous effect on our 
political system.

DECEMBER 1, 2020. 
CRISIS FOR THE VOCA CRIME VICTIMS FUND 
THE BASICS 
Fact: The Victim of Crime Act’s (VOCA) 
Crime Victims Fund (CVF) is a non-taxpayer 
source of funding that supports thousands of 
crime victims services providers serving mil-
lions of victims of crime annually and is 
funded by monetary penalties associated 
with federal criminal convictions. 
Fact: Deposits fluctuate annually based on 
the cases that the Department of Justice 
successfully prosecutes. 
Fact: Appropriators decide how much to 
release from the CVF every year. Statu-
torily, this money funds specific DOJ pro-
grams and state victim assistance grants and 
supplements 
state 
victim 
compensation 
funds. 
Fact: It is important to have money in the 
CVF to provide a buffer for lean years. Un-
fortunately, if there are too many lean years 
in a row, the CVF will not be able to provide 
that buffer. That is the situation we are cur-
rently facing. 
LOWER DEPOSITS LEAD TO CUTS IN GRANTS 
Fact: Deposits into the CVF are histori-
cally low. Deposits the last three years have 
been $445 million, $495 million and $503 mil-
lion respectively—deposits have not been 
this low since 2003. This decrease is caused in 
part by an increase in the use of deferred 
prosecution 
and 
non-prosecution 
agree-
ments, the monetary penalties associated 
with which are deposited into the General 
Treasury rather than the Crime Victims 
Fund. 
Fact: Lower deposits lead to lower re-
leases. Appropriators are justly cautious 
about depleting the CVF, and they are reluc-
tant to dip too deeply into the buffer the 
CVF provides, particularly if they do not see 
indications that the CVF will be replenished. 
Fact: The amount coming off the top for 
non-victim service grants is somewhat stat-
ic, which means that the cuts to the annual 
VOCA release disproportionately cut victim 
service grants. Thus, the percentage cut to 
victim service grants is larger than the per-
centage cut to the VOCA release. 
Fact: State grants decreased in both FY’19 
and FY’20, reflecting the decreased deposits. 
The Senate bill cuts these further. If the re-
lease was to reflect deposits without drawing 
down the balance in the CVF to dangerously 
low levels, assuming no transfers to fund 
other grants, victim assistance grants to the 
states could be cut to as little as approxi-
mately $200 million annually, only 10% of 
what went out in FY’20. 
THE IMPACT 
Fact: States are experiencing enormous 
cuts to their awards. See table below. 
Fact: Every state is at a different place in 
their grant cycles. Some subgrantees have 
already seen cuts (ex. Ohio), and some will 
see them in the next few years. 
Fact: CACs receive between $150 and $200 
million in VOCA dollars annually, which is 
the largest single source of funding for these 
programs. The cost of serving the more than 
371,000 children they helped last year was 
$614 million. If programs lose 70% of their 
funding, this would leave a $140 million def-
icit, equating to about 84,450 children. 
Fact: Victim services in Ohio lost $55 mil-
lion in 2020. Rape crisis programs specifically 
lost over $7.5 million, with individual pro-
grams losing between 32% and 57% (as well 
as three 100% cuts) of VOCA funds. This will 
essentially cut services in half, reducing sur-
vivor access to pre-2000 levels. 
THE SOLUTION 
Increase deposits into the Crime Victims 
Fund by depositing monetary penalties asso-
ciated with deferred prosecution and non- 
prosecution agreements into the CVF as well 
as monetary penalties associated with con-
victions. 
For more information about the problem 
and the solution, see this letter to Congress, 
signed by over 1,480 national, state, tribal, 
and local organizations and government 
agencies. The 56 State and Territorial Attor-
neys General also sent a letter to Congress, 
addressing some of these same issues. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCARTHY). Hopefully, he will soon be 
the majority leader or actually the 
Speaker of the House. He is not part of 
that California corruption I mentioned 
earlier. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
this week Democrats are pushing par-
tisan legislation that would change 
how we conduct elections and how we 
can speak about political issues. This 
legislation is the Democrats’ most 
pressing priority. Every single Demo-
crat is a cosponsor. 
Democrats made this bill H.R. 1, 
which is reserved for the bills the ma-
jority thinks are the very most impor-
tant. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
you 
know—and 
those who are watching and those 
across the country should understand— 
that when you become the majority, 
you reserve the first 10 numbers for 
whatever you want them to be. So this 
could have been H.R. 2, H.R. 3, H.R. 4, 
H.R. 5, H.R. 6, all the way up to 10 or 
go on to any other number. 
When I went out to talk to my con-
stituents in the world of COVID who 
are out of work and out of school, not 
one of them would think H.R. 1 would 
be something for politicians to protect 
themselves to get reelected. But every 
single Democrat believes that is the 
case. 
It wouldn’t just be in my district, but 
I would say that if you talk to any 
American, they would say: Back to 
work, back to school, and back to 
health. 
Madam Speaker, the priorities here 
are wrong. But it is not just because 
the Speaker thinks it so, because every 
single Democrat cosponsored this bill. 
It was bad when the Democrats intro-
duced it before COVID, and it is bad 
that they prioritize this over the chil-
dren going back to school, or people 
going back to work, or making sure 
every American who wants a vaccine

gets one. No. It shows the truth about 
what people think is the worst about 
people in Congress. They prioritize 
themselves over everything else. 
Let’s understand this bill. After a 
year of our country suffering through a 
pandemic, the Democrats’ first piece of 
legislation does not help the millions 
of students still out of school, and it 
does not help the 10 million Americans 
who are still unemployed. No. Demo-
crat legislation only helps themselves. 
Democrats want to use their razor-thin 
majority, not to pass bills to earn vot-
ers’ trust, but to ensure they don’t lose 
more seats in the next election. 
Madam Speaker, I know the leader-
ship on the other side predicted that 
they would win 20 seats. They only 
lost. I know that this is the most razor- 
thin majority the Democrats have seen 
in the last 100 years, so I guess that is 
why it is the top priority for every sin-
gle Democrat. 
Now, there are problems with this 
bill, so let’s understand it. 
First, H.R. 1 sends public dollars to 
fund political campaigns. Yes. 
Can you believe that, Madam Speak-
er? 
Madam Speaker, it is the number one 
priority you got elected to Congress to 
do. Forget everything else, I want to 
make sure I get more taxpayer money 
to fund my own campaign. I have to 
make sure I get reelected—not that the 
kids go back to school and not to dis-
tribute vaccines—to create a slush fund 
so that politicians can run for reelec-
tion. 
Let me explain it to you, Madam 
Speaker. It is in the fine print. Let’s 
say someone donates $200 to a preferred 
candidate. Under H.R. 1, taxpayers now 
must chip in not $200, but $1,200. 
Where in the world can you get that 
type of return on your investment? 
That is amazing. 
You talk somebody into giving you 
$200 for your campaign, Madam Speak-
er, so the taxpayers now have to give 
you $1,200. No wonder you made it the 
most important bill because it only fo-
cuses on you. 
Democrats want to raise this money 
through new fines on corporations 
which the government will use to pay 
for campaigns and political consult-
ants. I guess Democrats don’t actually 
believe corporate money is bad in poli-
tics. 
Today, corporations can’t give. I 
guess they found a loophole to help 
them. 
Second, H.R. 1 weakens the security 
of our elections by making it harder to 
protect against voter fraud. This bill 
automatically registers voters from 
the DMV and other government data-
bases such as food stamps. In most 
cases it would prevent officials from 
removing ineligible voters from the 
rolls and make it harder to verify the 
accuracy of voter information. Cur-
rently, an estimated 24 million voter 
records across the country appear to be 
inaccurate or invalid, and as we saw 
during the pandemic, this created 
chaos and confusion. 
It doesn’t matter if you are a Demo-
crat, Republican, or Independent. Ev-
eryone has a personal story of a friend, 
their family, or their neighbor receiv-
ing a ballot they shouldn’t have. Every 
one of those stories erodes trust in 
election integrity. Yet, under H.R. 1, 
future voters can be dead or illegal im-
migrants or maybe even registered two 
to three times. I guess Democrats just 
don’t care, as long as they get re-
elected. 
b 1045 
Third, H.R. 1 rewrites election laws 
and imposes one-size-fits-all partisan 
rules from Washington. 
Under the Constitution, we generally 
defer to States and counties to run 
elections. Democrats want to change 
that. First, they outlaw Dr. Seuss, and 
now they want to tell us what to say. 
They want to remove reasonable de-
bates about early voting, registration, 
and no-excuse mail-in balloting from 
the States and counties and resolve 
them with a single Federal solution de-
cided by the whims of Washington. It is 
not unusual, because I know the com-
mittee is also looking at, even though 
someone didn’t win an election, ap-
pointing somebody different in Con-
gress. 
They want to stop States from listen-
ing to their residents on the very best 
way to protect ballot integrity, wheth-
er it is passing voter I.D. laws or using 
basic safeguards like checking their 
voter rolls against the Post Office 
change-of-address system. 
They want to mandate no-excuse 
mail-in balloting and 15 days of early 
voting as the post-pandemic norm. 
Madam Speaker, in the last election, 
at least twice a week somebody would 
send me a picture of the ballots that 
were mailed to their home of people 
who had died or of people who had not 
lived there in 8 years. This would guar-
antee that continues. 
Fourth, H.R. 1 politicizes the Federal 
Election Commission by turning it 
from an evenly divided commission 
into a partisan one. But they are also 
going to create a speech czar. 
Can you imagine? The Federal Elec-
tion Commission has an even number 
of Republicans and an even number of 
Democrats. You have the smallest ma-
jority you have had in more than 100 
years, so your number one priority is 
to make sure you can’t keep that bi-
partisan. Let’s put our thumb on the 
scale and make sure we get one more 
Democrat than Republican. Then we 
can create a speech czar and tell people 
what to say and what they can’t say. 
So they can’t tell us in a bill we just 
passed that there is $140 million for a 
subway just outside the Speaker’s of-
fice. That would be wrong. But we also 
could get $200, but get $1,200 from the 
taxpayer. Who wouldn’t want this bill? 
Every single Democrat does. 
H.R. 1 weaponizes the IRS—can you 
imagine that—by allowing the IRS to 
consider an organization’s political 
views before granting tax exemptions. 
Now, they are going to pick and 
choose. You know, I thought this was 
unbelievable until I read this docu-
ment. 
If you live in China and you want to 
fly on an airline, you can walk up to 
the desk, you can have your money, 
but that doesn’t determine whether 
you get a ticket. You know what deter-
mines whether you get a ticket? Your 
score; what you have said. And if you 
said something that the government 
doesn’t like, you can’t fly on that 
plane. Unbelievable, right? That could 
never happen in America. 
Well, now we have a speech czar, we 
have made sure the Federal Election 
Commission is where they are, and now 
we weaponize the IRS to do exactly 
that. 
Remember, under President Obama’s 
IRS, this power was abused by Lois 
Lerner and other bureaucrats to target 
conservative nonprofits during the 2012 
election. It was a massive scandal, a 
clear and intolerable violation of pub-
lic trust, and a crime, which is why 
singling out groups for political views 
is banned. 
One hundred thirty nonprofits wrote 
to Congress to strongly object to H.R. 
1. Why would nonprofits object to this? 
They said America should be able to 
‘‘support causes we believe in without 
the fear of harassment or intimida-
tion.’’ Well, I guess they are right, be-
cause if this majority makes the num-
ber one issue—in a world of a pan-
demic, unemployment, and kids out of 
school—the protection of themselves, I 
would be afraid, too. 
If you are serious about restoring 
public trust in government, the ban 
must remain in place. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats call H.R. 
1 the For the People Act, but it really 
should be called the for the politicians 
act. It is not designed to protect Amer-
icans’ vote. It is designed to put a 
thumb on the scale in every election in 
America so that Democrats can turn a 
temporary majority into permanent 
control. It is an unparalleled political 
grab. I urge all my colleagues to oppose 
it. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN), 
my good friend and the ranking mem-
ber of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, which 
is it? For 3 months, the Democrats told 
us the 2020 election was fine. There was 
no need for an investigation. It was 
flawless. But, today, they tell us we 
need to change election law with an 
800-page bill. Think about it. We need 
all of this? 800 pages to fix a flawless 
election? Maybe something else is 
going on here. 
Last year, COVID was the pretext for 
making changes to election law. Par-
tisan courts and partisan secretaries of 
State went around State legislatures in 
an 
unconstitutional 
fashion 
and 
changed election law in some States,

and now they want to make sure those 
unconstitutional changes in a few 
States become the law in all States. 
That is what this is about. 
This isn’t the first time Democrats 
have tried to have it both ways, talked 
out of both sides of their mouth. Re-
member what they said. 
Democrats said: Republicans tried to 
overturn the will of the people on Jan-
uary 6, 2021, when we objected to six 
States. 
But on January 6, 2017, they objected 
to ten states. The Democrat chair of 
the Rules Committee objected to Ala-
bama, a State President Trump won by 
30 points. The lead impeachment man-
ager objected to Florida, and the chair-
woman of the Financial Services Com-
mittee objected to Wyoming. For good-
ness sake, a State that President 
Trump won by 40 points. They tried to 
overturn the will of the people in Wyo-
ming. 
We know what this is about. This is 
about raw politics, and we should all 
vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
PALMER), the chair of the Republican 
Policy Committee and my good friend. 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, if my 
Democrat 
colleagues 
were 
serious 
about making elections fair and hon-
est, they would start by enforcing a 
law they passed, the National Voter 
Registration Act of 1993. 
That law requires that every State 
and every county maintain accurate 
voter files. Yet, the Pew Research Cen-
ter reported that there are 24 million 
people improperly registered. 1.8 mil-
lion of them are dead. 2.7 million are 
registered in more than one State. The 
State of Michigan is 105 percent reg-
istered to vote, with 16 counties that 
are between 110 and 119 percent reg-
istered. Pennsylvania has over 800,000 
inactive voters still on the State’s 
voter registration files, and Los Ange-
les County has 1.6 million more people 
registered to vote than live in the 
county who are qualified to vote. 
There are 17 Democrat Members still 
serving in this Congress who voted for 
that law, including the Speaker and 
the majority leader. If you were serious 
about cleaning up our elections, you 
would enforce that law. 
As if the Federal takeover of elec-
tions isn’t enough, this bill would also 
force taxpayers to foot the bill for cam-
paigns. 
Just a few weeks ago, the majority 
stripped my colleague, MARJORIE TAY-
LOR GREENE, of her committee assign-
ments. This week, though, they seem 
to believe that even though she isn’t 
allowed to serve on any standing com-
mittees, she should receive taxpayer-fi-
nanced campaign contributions. 
Based on the formula in this bill and 
what Representative GREENE has raised 
already, this bill would give her over $7 
million. Every Democrat who voted to 
strip her of her committee assignments 
has cosponsored the bill that will send 
over $7 million of taxpayer money to 
fund her reelection. 
If this bill passes, it will create a rul-
ing class and tremendously undermine 
Americans’ right to self-government. 
In fact, this bill should be called for 
the permanent ruling class act. 
No one who truly wants fair and hon-
est elections, no one who wants people 
to have faith that their vote counts, 
will vote for this bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, you can tell we have 
got some dedicated Members of Con-
gress here to debate this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
GARBARINO), my great friend and one of 
the newest Members of Congress. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, 
we are facing a growing public mistrust 
of our electoral process. 
In my district alone, over 800 ballots 
in Nassau County were sent out in the 
wrong names and wrong addresses. In 
the school board election this year, I 
received three ballots at my house, one 
for me and two for the people who 
moved out 10 years ago. 
On election day, all over my district, 
in Ronkonkoma, Seaford, and Babylon, 
machines went down. Voters had to 
hand in their ballots, and then they 
were misplaced. 
I think all of us can agree that legis-
lative fixes are needed. But today, we 
are debating a bill, a partisan bill, 
whose sole aim is to secure a Demo-
cratic majority. 
This bill doubles down on problems 
that we saw during the 2020 election. 
Expanding mail-in voting—part of the 
problem. Legalizing ballot harvesting— 
part of the problem. Eliminating State 
ID—now you are just asking for a prob-
lem. Funding elections—I can think of 
a million things that can be done be-
fore we fund elections. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
STEEL), my good friend and another 
freshman Member of our historic fresh-
man class. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of free speech. 
I also rise today to protect our con-
stituents’ taxpayer dollars. 
This bill we are debating, H.R. 1, 
would federally mandate a 6-to-1 gov-
ernment match of contributions in con-
gressional or presidential campaigns. 
That means for every $200 donated to 
the campaign, the Federal Government 
would match $1,200. That is $1,200 of 
our constituents’ hard-earned tax dol-
lars sent to a campaign or candidate 
that they may not even agree with or 
believe in. 
In the upcoming 2022 election cycle, 
that means up to $7.2 million of public 
funds, per candidate, would be given to 
the candidates. This is not how the 
government should be spending our 
taxpayers’ money. 
H.R. 1 would also allow the IRS to in-
vestigate the political and policy back-
ground of organizations before grant-
ing tax-exempt status. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
15 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. STEEL). 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, this is 
a slippery slope towards discrimination 
against organizations. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to 
how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 30 seconds re-
maining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, vote ‘‘no’’ on this 
disastrous piece of legislation. Obvi-
ously, the timekeeper didn’t keep the 
time right; I should have more. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time is re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 5 min-
utes remaining. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, there have been a 
number of statements made on the 
floor today that were hair-on-fire inac-
curate, and 5 minutes would not be 
enough to actually correct the mis-
takes and the incorrect comments that 
have been made, but let me just ad-
dress a couple of them. 
I keep hearing ‘‘speech czar.’’ I must 
confess, when I first heard that, I 
thought, what the heck are they talk-
ing about? Then I looked at the rhet-
oric, and it appears that there is an ob-
jection to section 603 of the bill, which 
allows the chair of the FEC and other 
commissioners to take certain actions. 
Now, it has nothing to do with being 
a speech czar. There is no connection 
with that. To suggest that the FEC 
doing its job is somehow becoming a 
speech czar is just not correct. 
I have heard a lot of comments about 
the voucher program. People have ob-
jected to our tax dollars being spent. 
Well, here is the good news: There are 
no tax dollars being spent in this pro-
gram. It is a pilot project that allows 
for a matching system to see whether 
small donors can actually empower 
more diversity and empower the voices 
of ordinary Americans as compared to 
the big interests.

could be used for anything else in the 
government. It is an additional penalty 
to corporations that have done wrong 
and are fined. There will be an addi-
tional fine to fund this pilot project. 
I have heard that somehow H.R. 1 
would allow the IRS to go after con-
servative groups. That is not true. Sec-
tion 4501 simply repeals the prohibition 
that prevents the IRS from examining 
the meaning of social welfare in the 
context of 501(c)(4) organizations. That 
is about any group that misuses the 
Tax Code for politics, pretending to be 
a social welfare group, whatever their 
ideology. It never made sense to pre-
clude the IRS from doing this job. That 
would be like prohibiting the FEC from 
administering the Federal elections 
code. 
Voter ID: Members act as if that is 
just a piece of cake. Well, 11 percent of 
eligible voters in the United States 
don’t have an ID, and they can’t get it 
because they don’t have the money to 
pay for the underlying documents that 
would be necessary to get that ID. And 
those 11 percent are disproportionately 
senior citizens, young people, people 
with disabilities, low-income voters. So 
what is the alternative? They sign 
under penalty of perjury. They can be 
prosecuted for a felony if they are 
lying. 
Ballot harvesting: There is no such 
thing as harvesting ballots. It is about 
getting someone you trust to turn in 
your ballot for you if you can’t do it 
yourself. We have had that in Cali-
fornia for many years. I will note that 
Republican candidates used that exten-
sively in California this year. There 
was no evidence of fraud when they did 
it, and there was no evidence of fraud 
when Democrats did it. You give your 
ballot to your neighbor, if you wish. 
The neighbor has to sign, and they turn 
it in for you. That is not fraud, and it 
is not a problem. 
Finally, I just want to address the 
issue of so-called Federal overreach. 
The Constitution of the United States, 
Article I, Section 4 says this: ‘‘The 
times, places, and manner of holding 
elections for Senators and Representa-
tives shall be prescribed in each State 
by the legislature thereof,’’ but here is 
the important next section, ‘‘but the 
Congress may at any time by law make 
or alter such regulations.’’ And that is 
what we are doing in H.R. 1. 
I think it is interesting that earlier 
this year the Republican Study Com-
mittee endorsed the Save Democracy 
Act. That legislation would establish 
national 
standards 
for 
prohibiting 
automatic voter registration, to make 
it hard to cast a ballot, to impose re-
strictive rules on vote tabulation. So, I 
guess that overreach only matters to 
my colleagues if it empowers voters, 
not if it restricts voters. 
For too long, this Chamber has been 
silent, and this silence has harmed the 
people. We need to stop that silence 
and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
express my strong opposition to H.R. 1 and 
my great disappointment that the Majority re-
fused to allow my commonsense amendments 
to be offered to this bill. This bill was written 
behind closed doors and though Members of 
Congress offered over 180 amendments to im-
prove this bill only 56 were allowed to be of-
fered on the House floor. That is a travesty for 
Congress and the American people who want 
and deserve honest and transparent elections. 
While serving in the Florida Senate I was 
tasked with reforming Florida’s election laws 
following the 2000 election and chaos that en-
sued. Having tackled election reform in the 
aftermath of an uncertain election, I know first-
hand how important it is to restore confidence 
and eliminate existing grey areas that may 
lead to fraud or raise questions about fairness. 
Events surrounding the 2020 election raised 
questions from my constituents about the op-
eration and certification of voting machines 
used throughout our state and the nation. 
Chief among those concerns was whether our 
voting machines are connected to the internet 
and vulnerable to manipulation through hack-
ing. To answer these and other questions I 
contacted the U.S. Election Assistance Com-
mission which certifies voting hardware and 
software for use in our elections. 
In her letter to me, the Inspector General of 
the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ad-
dressed this topic stating that the ‘‘EAC be-
lieves Michigan may use modem transmission 
features in at least some of its Dominion vot-
ing systems.’’ This is in direct conflict with as-
sertions by the maker of the Dominion Voting 
System who stated, ‘‘. . . Voting systems are 
by design meant to be used as closed sys-
tems that are not networked meaning they are 
not connected to the Internet.’’ 
To end the confusion on this issue and re-
store confidence in our system, I filed an 
amendment that would prohibit voting systems 
from being connected to the Internet; specifi-
cally, stating that no system or device upon 
which ballots are programmed or votes are 
cast or tabulated shall be connected to the 
Internet at any time. That would ensure the in-
tegrity of voting machines. Unfortunately, that 
amendment was not allowed to be debated 
and voted on. 
My second amendment would ensure that 
election machines are fully auditable—no 
longer would election officials and election 
equipment providers deny full audits of elec-
tions due to proprietary software or hardware. 
The American people have a right to a full 
audit of any election to ensure the full integrity 
of elections. There is no good reason to op-
pose this amendment but, again, it was not al-
lowed to be debated and voted on. 
And, my third amendment would have pro-
hibited the use of voting systems produced by 
a foreign entity. It would also require all com-
ponents of the voting systems be manufac-
tured and maintained in the United States. 
Why should the votes of the American people 
be subject to counting using foreign equipment 
that cannot be audited and that may be con-
nected to the Internet? My amendments would 
ban all three of these things. 
By denying elected Members of Congress a 
vote on these amendments, Speaker PELOSI 
decided against providing full transparency 
and accountability in our federal elections. 
This partisan bill should be rejected. 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, if my Demo-
crat colleagues were serious about making 
elections fair and honest they would start by 
enforcing a law they passed—The National 
Voter Registration Act of 1993. That law re-
quires that every state and every county main-
tain accurate voter files. Yet the Pew Re-
search Center reported that there are 24 mil-
lion people improperly registered . . . 1.8 mil-
lion are dead, 2.7 million are registered to vote 
in more than one state. The state of Michigan 
is 105 percent registered to vote with sixteen 
counties with voter registration between 110– 
119 percent. 
Pennsylvania has over 800,000 inactive vot-
ers still on the state’s voter registration files 
and Los Angeles County had 1.6 million more 
people registered to vote than people living in 
the county who are qualified to vote. The fail-
ure to maintain accurate voter files is an invi-
tation for election fraud. If my Democrat col-
leagues are serious about restoring con-
fidence in our elections they should be push-
ing states to comply with the law. There are 
17 Democrat members still serving in this 
Congress who voted for the National Voter 
Registration Act including the Speaker and the 
Majority Leader. Why aren’t they pushing for 
cleaning up our voter registration files in every 
state? 
As if the federal takeover of elections wasn’t 
enough, this bill would also force taxpayers to 
foot the bill for campaigns. Just a few weeks 
ago the majority stripped my colleague MAR-
JORIE TAYLOR GREENE of her committee as-
signments. This week they seem to believe 
that though she isn’t allowed to serve on any 
standing committees she should receive tax-
payer financed campaign contributions. Based 
on the formula in this bill and what Rep. 
GREENE has raised already this bill would give 
her over $7 million. Every Democrat who 
voted to strip Rep. GREENE of her committees 
has also co-sponsored the bill that would send 
over 7 million dollars to fund her re-election. 
If this bill passes it will create a ruling class 
and tremendously undermine Americans’ right 
to self-government. In fact, this bill should be 
called the For The Permanent Ruling Class 
Act. No one who truly wants fair and honest 
elections, No one who wants the American 
people to trust our elections, to have faith that 
their vote counts, will vote for this bill. 
Ms. ESHOO. H.R. 1, For the People Act, is 
one of the most important bills Congress can 
consider because it strengthens and reforms 
our democracy at a time in history when it is 
especially fragile. This sweeping legislation is 
divided into three sections: voting, campaign 
finance, and ethics. Its numerous provisions 
expand voting rights, diminish the corrosive in-
fluence of money in politics, and bolster ethics 
and transparency to ensure government works 
for the people. 
Voting is a fundamental right in a democ-
racy, and H.R. 1 will expand voter rolls by re-
quiring every state to adopt automatic and 
same-day voter registration, just as California 
has. The bill ends partisan gerrymandering by 
requiring states to adopt independent redis-
tricting commissions and makes it easier to 
vote by expanding early voting and allowing 
every American to vote by mail, just as mil-
lions did last November during the pandemic. 
H.R. 1 reforms our campaign finance sys-
tem to address the disastrous Citizens United 
decision that opened the floodgates to unlim-
ited contributions from anonymous donors. 
The legislation establishes a public Fair Elec-
tions Fund to match small dollar donations,

strengthens 
Federal 
Election 
Commission 
(FEC) oversight of Super PACs, and requires 
‘‘dark money’’ independent expenditure groups 
to disclose their donors just as candidates and 
Super PACs must do. 
Lastly, the bill holds public officials account-
able by closing lobbyist registration loopholes, 
strengthens conflict of interest rules, and em-
powers the Office of Government Ethics to 
better enforce ethics laws. 
I’m very proud that H.R. 1 includes two 
major provisions I authored. The bill includes 
my Presidential Tax Transparency Act which 
requires the president and vice president to 
publicly release their tax returns annually. It 
also requires major party candidates for both 
offices to release ten prior years of tax returns 
within 15 days of accepting their party’s nomi-
nation. Tax returns contain vital information 
such as whether a candidate has paid any 
taxes; what assets they own; if they’ve bor-
rowed money and from whom; whether 
they’ve taken advantage of tax loopholes and 
offshore tax shelters; and whether they have 
foreign bank accounts. The disclosure of a 
presidential candidate ’s tax returns is particu-
larly important because the American people 
should be able to vet their finances before the 
election. 
For decades, presidents and presidential 
candidates voluntarily released their tax re-
turns. I introduced the Presidential Tax Trans-
parency Act in 2016 when this bipartisan tradi-
tion was abandoned and it became clear that 
we could no longer rely on voluntary disclo-
sure. Presidential candidates must be held to 
the highest standards of transparency to en-
sure confidence that they will work solely for 
the interests of the American people, not their 
own financial gain. 
I’m also pleased that H.R. 1 establishes 
Election Day as a federal holiday. I’ve intro-
duced similar legislation with Rep. DONALD 
MCEACHIN in the past three Congresses to 
give Americans the time off they need to vote 
and participate in our democracy. U.S. voter 
turnout in 2020 was the highest in over a cen-
tury, but it consistently lags behind turnout in 
other established democracies, many of which 
vote on a weekend or holiday. While there are 
many factors that influence voter turnout, mak-
ing Election Day a federal holiday will make 
voting easier and give Americans an oppor-
tunity to celebrate the importance of civic en-
gagement and participation in the proud Amer-
ican tradition of self-governance. 
H.R. 1 includes all of these important re-
forms and many others, and I’m proud to vote 
in favor of this critical legislation.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN) and the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) each will control 
10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. LOFGREN. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this bloc of amend-
ments provides important additions to 
H.R. 1 that strengthen the bill and en-
hance voter access. 
This bloc includes, for example, an 
amendment 
from 
the 
gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania that requires States 
to ensure that there are polling places 
during the early voting period on col-
lege campuses. This will help young 
people to engage in our elections and 
will likely help boost youth turnout. 
It also includes an amendment from 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
that will help ensure the timely deliv-
ery of absentee ballots by the Postal 
Service. It calls for the Postal Service 
to perform same-day processing of bal-
lots when they are received at a postal 
facility. 
Also included is an amendment from 
the gentlewoman from Georgia that 
supports access to the franchise. It im-
plements voter protections by ensuring 
that States cannot prohibit access to 
voting materials provided by third par-
ties, such as get-out-the-vote organiza-
tions. 
There is also an amendment from the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania that al-
lows for voter education information at 
naturalization ceremonies for newly 
sworn-in citizens. That will help edu-
cate and inform new citizens about the 
opportunities to register to vote. 
Finally, there is an amendment from 
the gentlewoman from Texas that ex-
empts cybersecurity assistance, includ-
ing assistance in responding to threats 
or harassment online, from limits on 
coordinated political party expendi-
tures. 
Madam Speaker, I support these 
amendments. I urge their adoption, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, we have so much op-
position on our side to this bill. I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER), my good friend, 
since we ran out of debate time on gen-
eral debate. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the underlying bill. This legislation 
masquerades as a fix to the country’s 
election 
concerns. 
However, 
that 
couldn’t be further from the truth. 
This bill relaxes ethics requirements 
with a change in administration. It 
forces taxpayers to subsidize elections 
and election outreach. It compromises

States’ rights and leaves Washington 
as the arbiter of managing elections, 
which runs against the Constitution. It 
would limit free speech and weaken the 
First Amendment protections that ev-
eryone here holds in such high regard. 
This legislation compromises State 
voter ID integrity laws and moves to 
roll back the important work that has 
been done in this space. It alters the 
Federal Election Commission’s makeup 
and effectively limits any bipartisan 
consensus or work that can be done. 
This isn’t a bipartisan bill intended 
to unite the country and mend con-
cerns about elections. No, this is an-
other partisan package that was rushed 
to the floor and, subsequently, could 
have serious consequences for our con-
stituents and our Nation. 
This bill will weaken what many 
States are doing to improve election 
security and establishes a dangerous 
precedent for the involvement of Fed-
eral agencies in election issues. 
For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose the un-
derlying bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS), a 
new member of the House who has two 
amendments encompassed in this en 
bloc amendment. 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the 
For the People Act, to restore integ-
rity and ethics in our electoral process. 
To strengthen the bill, I have offered 
two amendments to empower younger 
generations to work together to tackle 
the challenges that will define our life-
times. Climate change, gun violence, 
and reproductive rights energize and 
galvanize 
younger 
Americans. 
The 
right to vote is how they are heard and 
how they make change. My amend-
ments will expand and protect this 
right for young people. 
The For the People Act must live up 
to its name, and I am proud to offer 
these amendments that reinforce the 
importance of a democracy that brings 
all Americans, regardless of age, race, 
gender identity, or income, to the bal-
lot box to cast their votes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GON-
ZALEZ), my good friend, who, in spite of 
once being an Ohio State Buckeye and 
an Indianapolis Colt, it took him com-
ing to Congress to finally win a foot-
ball championship. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to this en 
bloc amendment and H.R. 1, the so- 
called For the People Act. 
It is hard to know exactly where to 
begin when considering how misguided 
this bill truly is. If this bill becomes 
law, we will have nationwide universal 
mail-in balloting, ballot harvesting, 
and taxpayer-funded elections where 
for every $1 of contribution from an in-
dividual, the Federal Government will 
kick in $6. Additionally, this bill elimi-
nates the voter ID laws in all 50 States 
and effectively eliminates signature 
matching. 
The sad truth is that there are things 
that we could be doing on a bipartisan 
basis to improve our election process. 
In the last Congress, many of my 
Democratic colleagues supported au-
diting of election results. I agree and 
believe we could find genuine com-
promise on that important point. 
It is for all these reasons and many, 
many more that I urge my colleagues 
to oppose H.R. 1. It is a bad bill. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to re-
mind my friend from Illinois that if it 
weren’t for my participation, I don’t 
know that we would have won that 
game. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. The 
gentleman is right. We really did enjoy 
having him on that bipartisan congres-
sional football championship team. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma 
(Mrs. BICE), another star member of 
this freshman class. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
package of en bloc amendments. These 
amendments continue to go down a 
path that is partisan and unnecessary. 
I also strongly oppose the underlying 
bill, H.R. 1, the so-called For the Peo-
ple Act. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1 would retract 
the hard work that States such as 
Oklahoma have done to improve our 
election laws. 
When I served in the Oklahoma State 
Legislature, we implemented require-
ments to ensure the security of our 
elections in our State. However, H.R. 1 
includes a Federal mandate that would 
take away the ability of States to over-
see and manage their own elections. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter from Paul Ziriax, the 
secretary of the Oklahoma State Elec-
tion Board, in which he raises serious 
concerns that H.R. 1 would supersede 
most of Oklahoma’s election laws. 
OKLAHOMA STATE ELECTION BOARD, 
Oklahoma City, OK, February 25, 2021. 
Hon. JIM INHOFE, United States Senator. 
Hon. JAMES LANKFORD, United States Sen-
ator. 
Hon. KEVIN HERN, United States Representa-
tive, District 1. 
Hon. MARKWAYNE
MULLIN, United States

Hon. STEPHANIE BICE, United States Rep-

TO THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE OKLA-
HOMA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION: As Okla-
homa’s chief election official, I am writing 
to make you aware of my concerns regarding 
H.R. 1, as introduced in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, and its U.S. Senate com-
panion, S. 1. 
H.R. 1’s election administration compo-
nent would result in an unnecessary federal 
takeover of election administration policy 
across the nation. One sponsor’s stated goal 
of this legislation is to ‘‘overcome rampant 
voter suppression’’—yet I have seen no evi-
dence of such rampant ‘‘suppression’’ here in 
our state. 
H.R. 1 would supersede most of Oklahoma’s 
election administration and election integ-
rity laws, making our elections less secure, 
more complicated to administer, and much 
more expensive to conduct. Although H.R. 1 
claims to only apply to ‘‘federal’’ elections, 
almost all elections here could be affected 
because Oklahoma’s state and county elec-
tions are held on the same dates as federal 
elections. 
Although the concerns with H.R. 1 are too 
numerous to provide an exhaustive list in 
this letter, there are some fairly amazing 
levels of micromanagement of elections in 
this legislation: from requiring ‘‘self-seal-
ing’’ return envelopes, to setting the number 
of days of ‘‘early’’ voting, to mandating that 
new state voting systems be capable of 
‘‘ranked choice’’ elections, to dictating how 
close voting locations must be to public 
transportation stops. 
H.R. 1 is incompatible with many of Okla-
homa’s existing state laws. For example, 
Oklahoma law requires that federal elections 
must be certified one week after the date of 
the election. But H.R. 1 disregards such 
deadlines, requiring absentee ballots to be 
accepted and counted 10 days after Election 
Day—which is three days after the state 
must certify the election results. 
This legislation takes direct aim at Okla-
homa’s existing election integrity laws, 
making it virtually impossible for election 
officials to verify the identity of in-person 
and mail absentee voters, requiring states to 
allow 
untrackable 
absentee 
ballot 
har-
vesting, mandating voter registration by 
telephone, and making it nearly impossible 
to prevent double voting by allowing voters 
to vote anywhere in the state whether they 
are registered to vote at that location or 
not. In an H.R. 1 world, Oklahoma election 
officials would have no means to reassure 
the electorate that an election is fraud-free. 
Other provisions will add great uncer-
tainty to elections in Oklahoma, such as the 
requirement that tribal leaders can deter-
mine certain voting locations on tribal 
land—which given the recent U.S. Supreme 
Court’s McGirt decision, might be inter-
preted as most of the State of Oklahoma. 
Finally, H.R. 1 does not include realistic 
timelines for implementing its election ad-
ministration changes. By our estimation, 
implementing even a few of its major provi-
sions might take years—yet H.R. 1 demands 
that dozens of major new election adminis-
tration policies and technologies be put in 
place in time for the 2022 elections. This is 
setting up election officials for failure, and I 
fear that many experienced election admin-
istrators in our state may quit or retire 
rather than attempting the near-impossible 
task of implementing the provisions of H.R. 
1 should it become law. 
There are legitimate disagreements about 
election policies. In fact, most states have 
very different election procedures. This is by 
design. Under the Constitution and our fed-
eral system of government, it is the respon-
sibility of State Legislatures to determine 
the time, manner and place of elections. 
Congress should not attempt to implement a 
one-size-fits-all set of election rules for the 
states. For this reason, it seems likely that 
the enactment of H.R. 1 would almost cer-
tainty lead to costly and lengthy litigation. 
If you or your staff would like to discuss 
this issue further, please feel free to contact 
me. Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
PAUL ZIRIAX, Secretary, 
Oklahoma State Election Board. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, the Constitution is clear that

March 2, 2021 
States prescribe the time, places, and 
manner of holding elections. 
While the majority claims that this 
is a bill to reform our political system, 
the reality is that the changes in this 
bill would likely lead to a greater inci-
dence of voter fraud and would deprive 
States of the right to oversee the ad-
ministration of their own elections. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. It is 
interesting that during this same de-
bate 2 years ago, we had many in the 
majority come talk about this bill. I 
would say they must feel a little bit 
different this time. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
FITZGERALD), 
another 
mediocre—I 
mean, a star freshman of our historic 
class and my good friend. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in objection to H.R. 1, the so- 
called For the People Act. 
Contrary to the title, the bill puts 
politicians ahead of the American peo-
ple and codifies nationwide election 
changes made last year that shook the 
faith of Americans in the integrity of 
our elections. 
When Americans vote, they put faith 
in the idea that our system of govern-
ment gives them a voice in our democ-
racy. If this faith is betrayed and 
Americans become skeptical of their 
vote, the trust our system is built upon 
collapses, and they do not want it to 
collapse. 
The bill would take us down this very 
path of losing trust by taking constitu-
tionally granted authority out of the 
hands of the States and local officials 
and destroying the safeguards of elec-
tion integrity. 
For example, not only would this bill 
do nothing to address ballot har-
vesting, but it would take the practice 
nationwide. We have seen the irreg-
ularities created by this practice and 
how ballot harvesting allows manipula-
tion and intimidation in several elec-
tions across this country. 
b 1115 
In the 2020 election, this happened in 
Wisconsin, where ballot harvesting is 
not supposed to be permitted. In those 
instances, voter registration and ab-
sentee ballots were completed and col-
lected in unsecured outdoor areas prior 
to the date allowed under State law. 
I am also proud to have implemented 
strong voter ID laws during my time in 
the Wisconsin Legislature. Unfortu-
nately, over the past year, I saw those 
protections 
steamrolled 
under 
the 
guise of the pandemic, allowing over 
200,000 voters to submit a ballot with-
out showing an ID. 
This bill would permanently open the 
floodgates by forcing States to allow 
individuals to vote without an ID sim-
ply by signing a statement, effectively 
banning State voter ID laws. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
15 seconds to the gentleman from Wis-
consin. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. As elected offi-
cials, we have a duty to maintain the 
faith of our voters in the integrity of 
our elections. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, here we are again 
with more Federal election mandates 
that the majority would impose on our 
States and localities. Article I, Section 
4 of the Constitution gives States the 
primary authority to set the ‘‘times, 
places, and manner of holding elections 
for Senators and Representatives.’’ 
Congress’ role in this space is purely 
secondary and reserved only for cor-
recting highly significant and substan-
tial deficiencies. We saw nothing in 
2020 that would rise to the level of a 
complete and total nationalization of 
our election system. 
To give you some sense of the level of 
control the majority feels it should 
exert over our elections, amendments 
in this en bloc would mandate even the 
positioning of ballot drop boxes and 
polling locations. It would also man-
date voters’ requests for absentee bal-
lots and the methods used for recruit-
ing poll workers. 
The underlying bill would require 
States to provide 15 days of early vot-
ing at 10 hours a day, even in States 
that 
conduct 
their 
elections 
com-
pletely by mail. 
The underlying bill would regulate 
the amount of time a voter could wait 
in line to vote. Here is the deal: No one 
wants any voter to wait in a long line 
to vote, but setting aside the constitu-
tional issues for a second, do we really 
think this body can make a one-size- 
fits-all decision that works for the 
unique people who live in each of our 
diverse 50 States? 
This provision, coupled with the 
bill’s private right of action, would 
simply set up a stopwatch stakeout at 
polling locations for ambulance-chas-
ing trial attorneys. 
States run elections in this country. 
I urge each of my colleagues to speak 
with their State’s secretary of state or 
chief election officials and local elec-
tion officials. Learn from the people 
who 
actually 
administer 
elections. 
State and local election administrators 
know best the needs of their voting 
population. 
I speak with secretaries of state from 
across the country regularly to keep up 
to date on election issues. Just last 
week, at the only hearing held in this 
Congress on the underlying bill, the 
minority called the only witness who 
had even ever administered an elec-
tion. So I know many of my colleagues 
could benefit from learning more about 
their State’s election processes. 
For these reasons, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on these amendments and the under-
lying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Missouri 
(Ms. 
BUSH), a new Member of Congress and a 
member of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee, who I serve with. 
Ms. 
BUSH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
St. 
Louis and I rise today in support of the 
en bloc amendment to H.R. 1, the For 
the People Act. 
Our country’s unhoused community 
members are criminalized, disregarded, 
and demonized. I have been unhoused 
and, in those bleak days, I felt as 
though my own government had for-
saken me. 
My amendment to expand voting ac-
cess to our unhoused community is 
rooted in love, a love that says you do 
not need an address for your vote to 
matter. 
We must ensure our unhoused com-
munity members and our neighbors are 
protected from States that want to 
suppress their votes. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I see we have a new 
clock watcher. How much time do we 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 11⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
California has 71⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we can’t say much 
more about how bad this bill is. Just 
the distortions, the mistruths, and just 
obvious malicious errors coming from 
the majority about what this bill does 
is frustrating. 
Last Congress, when this bill was in-
troduced, this bill started funding 
Members of Congress’ campaigns with 
taxpayer dollars. And back then, under 
the 2018 calculations, every Member of 
Congress was only eligible to get about 
$4 million added to their campaign ac-
counts. 
Now, if you look at the top 20, 11 
Democrats make up the top 20, and 9 
Republicans, in disbursements over the 
2020 cycle. Every single Member of this 
body is eligible through the 6-to-1 
matching program to get $7.2 million. 
No matter what Speaker PELOSI says, 
no matter what the majority says— 
they can tell you it is not true—read 
the bill. It is in the bill. 
They are going to say, well, it is not 
taxpayer dollars. Let me go through 
the process. It is corporate money, cor-
porate dollars that we cannot get in 
our campaigns right now that is then 
taken from corporations who, in their 
name, are bad actors. 
Remember, Congress sets the level of 
fines. And a lot of these fines already 
go to good causes, like crime victim 
funds, rape crisis centers. They are 
going to get shortchanged because that

money, taxpayer dollars, and then it is 
given directly to Members of Congress’ 
campaigns. 
Madam Speaker, a vote for this bill is 
a vote for you, yourself, $7.2 million in 
your own campaign. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Just a few points. As I am sure the 
gentleman from Illinois knows, we had 
a markup last year on H.R. 1, and one 
of the issues raised was the propriety 
of having taxpayer dollars fund the 
pilot program, the matching program. 
And we agreed—we agreed with that 
observation. So we changed it. We 
made an amendment to address that 
concern. 
It is not an additional—an existing 
fund. If a corporation does wrong and is 
assessed a fine, there is an additional 
fine hit on that bad-doing corporation 
that would fund the pilot project. And 
if there aren’t enough bad-doers to ac-
tually fully fund the program, the pro-
gram is scaled back. There is no tax-
payer money in this program. 
These amendments in this bill ad-
dress things that are important. And 
let me just reference the letter from 
the attorneys general that I included 
in the RECORD earlier. We are talking 
about what is happening right now, and 
this is what they state: 
‘‘. . . State legislators have seized 
upon former President Trump’s base-
less voter fraud allegations to curtail 
mail-in voting options, impose strin-
gent voter ID requirements, limit voter 
registration opportunities, and allow 
even more aggressive purging of voter 
rolls. In the wake of a safe and secure 
election, which enabled greater levels 
of voter participation than in over a 
century, we should be building on this 
progress, not dismantling it.’’ 
And that is what this act would do. 
They go on to say: 
‘‘The act includes several measures 
that would neutralize these cynical ef-
forts at voter suppression. . . .’’ 
Madam Speaker, I think we should 
recognize that what is going on in 
State legislatures around the United 
States right now is, in fact, what the 
attorneys general have said, a cynical 
effort to suppress the vote, because we 
have the greatest voter turnout in 
American history with the new tools 
that the pandemic actually led us to: a 
broader opportunity to cast your vote 
by absentee, a broader opportunity to 
vote early. 
We had great turnout. And I don’t 
know in the end which party will ben-
efit when more Americans vote. 
Could it be the Republicans? Could it 
be the Democrats? 
I don’t know. But I do know this: 
Who will win is America. America wins 
when all Americans have a chance to 
cast their vote. 
So, once again, I would like to thank 
the attorneys general of Maryland, Col-
orado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, 
Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Nevada, and Washington 
for standing up for the rule of law, for 
pointing out that H.R. 1 will lead to 
clean elections, and that American de-
mocracy needs repairing, and this bill 
will repair it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the en bloc amendments, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN) and the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. STEIL) each will control 10 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, my 
Republican colleagues are the authors 
of all of the amendments included in 
this en bloc, and I think these amend-
ments represent a number of thought-
ful amendments that will improve the 
bill. 
Included is an amendment that ex-
empts any State that does not utilize 
voter registration on the enactment 
date of this act and continuously 
thereafter from complying with voter 
registration requirements in the act. 
This is reasonable, as North Dakota 
does not have voter registration. As 
the State does not require voter reg-
istration, it is reasonable not to force 
them to begin doing so now. 
There is also an amendment in this 
en bloc that requires a report to Con-
gress on the impact of widespread 
mail-in voting on the suffrage of Ac-
tive Duty military servicemembers, 
how quickly their votes are counted 
and whether the high volumes of mail- 
in votes makes it harder for those indi-
viduals to vote. 
Republicans and Democrats alike, 
can agree that insights into how to 
better secure our election infrastruc-
ture are needed to protect our democ-
racy. 
Included in this en bloc is an amend-
ment to require a report to Congress on 
the data collection practices; the re-
quired necessary security resources; 
and the impact of a potential data 
breach of local, State, or Federal on-
line voter registration systems. 
Additionally, there is an amendment 
directing the Election Assistance Com-
mission to study the use of blockchain 
technology to enhance election secu-
rity. I hope that study will include the 
use of electricity in the creation of 
blockchain technology. 
b 1130 
Much of H.R. 1’s provisions are aimed 
at restoring the American public’s 
faith in the government by improving 
ethics standards imposed on public of-
ficials. 
An amendment included in this en 
bloc 
would 
require 
ethics 
waivers 
granted by Congress to the executive 
branch officials to be disclosed, and re-
quire members of the Presidential 
transition team to disclose nongovern-
mental positions they have held in the 
year prior to starting their service on 
the transition team. 
I thank my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle for putting forward 
these amendments, and I believe it will 
gather bipartisan support. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. COMER), my colleague. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I urge 
all Members, on a bipartisan basis, to 
support this amendment. 
When reviewing H.R. 1 as introduced 
this Congress, I noticed it was missing 
several ethics provisions that were in-
cluded in the bill last Congress when 
Donald Trump was President. But now 
that Joe Biden is President, those eth-
ics 
provisions 
conveniently 
dis-
appeared. 
What was missing from this updated 
version of H.R. 1 were the following 
provisions: 
Requirements that Presidential tran-
sition teams disclose a list of all posi-
tions each transition team member 
held outside the Federal Government 
for the previous 12-month period, in-
cluding paid and unpaid positions. 
Requirements that Presidential tran-
sition teams disclose sources of com-
pensation for each transition team 
member exceeding $5,000 a year for the 
previous 12-month period. 
And a requirement that the head of 
the Federal department or agency, or 
their designee, shall not permit access 
to the Federal department or agency, 
or employees of such department or 
agency, that would not be provided to 
a member of the public for any transi-
tion team member who does not make 
the required prior employment and 
conflicts of interest disclosures. 
It is clear the absence of these provi-
sions was pure politics, but my amend-
ment adds those provisions back since 
what is good for a Republican Presi-
dent is good for a Democrat President 
or his or her administration. 
Ethical principles are supposed to be 
universal. They are supposed to apply 
equally. And this bill, that so obvi-
ously exempts one political party from 
ethics rules, is not itself ethical. Many 
Democrats should vote for this amend-
ment since it restores what Democrats 
proposed in the last Congress. We took 
the exact language and included it in 
this bill. 
If this bill had gone through regular 
order and had been marked up in a 
committee, we could have addressed 
these discrepancies at the committee 
level instead of imposing this extended 
amendment 
process 
on 
the 
whole 
House. But this bill did not go through 
regular order, and so I offered this 
amendment 
at 
the 
Committee 
on 
Rules. This amendment restores to the 
bill ethics provisions that were origi-
nally intended to apply for President 
Trump and his advisers but were 
dropped from the bill for President 
Biden’s administration. 
Applying ethics rules to one political 
party but not another is wrong. The 
Committee on Rules, to their credit, 
took a step toward correcting this 
wrong by making this evenhanded 
amendment in order. Now, it remains 
for the full House to pass this amend-
ment and to show its agreement on a 
bipartisan 
basis 
that 
ethics 
rules 
should apply equally. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members 
to join me in supporting the Comer 
amendment No. 18 in en bloc No. 2. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG), my colleague 
and good friend. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle recognizing the unique na-
ture of the State of North Dakota. 
In 1993, the Voter Registration Act 
passed and there were six States that 
did not have voter registration. And so, 
rightfully so, under thoughtful and 
considered language, they exempted 
the States who didn’t have voter reg-
istration from the Voter Registration 
Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H999 
March 2, 2021 
Well, now we are in 2021, and the only 
State in the country that doesn’t have 
voter registration is the State of North 
Dakota. So as this process has been 
going on and the different fights that 
exists, which I agree with my col-
leagues on this side of the aisle on a lot 
of those issues, we find ourselves in a 
fairly unique position in that the in-
tent of what people are trying to do 
with this bill would have actually 
made it more difficult in a lot of cases 
in North Dakota for how we do things. 
We are proud of our quirky board of 
elections system. I will just tell you, 
when I served in the State legislature, 
I was the chair of the State Senate Ju-
diciary 
Committee, 
which 
was 
in 
charge of election law. And North Da-
kotans are very proud of it. I also 
served as the State party chair for 3 
years, so I was very frustrated by the 
fact that we didn’t have voter registra-
tion. So even in my own background, I 
had conflicting views on this. 
Madam Speaker, I just appreciate the 
ability of everybody working together 
because this is really important to my 
State, and it would fundamentally 
alter things, and not in a good way. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS), my colleague. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for the recogni-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer 
an amendment to H.R. 1, Burgess 
amendment No. 12, which would re-
quire the Attorney General of the 
United States to submit a report to 
Congress on the impact of widespread 
mail-in voting on the ability of Active 
Duty military servicemembers to vote, 
how quickly their votes could be count-
ed, and whether the higher volumes of 
mail-in votes makes it harder for those 
individuals to vote in national elec-
tions. 
America’s servicemembers put their 
lives on the line to protect our country 
and everything it stands for. We must 
ensure their voices are heard in our 
elections. If the majority has their way 
with the underlying bill in perma-
nently expanding mail-in voting, Con-
gress must first know that such poli-
cies won’t negatively impact those we 
rely on to ensure that our voices are 
heard in the first place. 
A 
second 
amendment, 
Burgess 
amendment No. 13, would require a re-
port on voter data collection efforts at 
local, State, and Federal levels, and 
make the resources necessary to defend 
such efforts from cyberattacks and the 
impact of potential data breaches of 
local, State, or Federal online voter 
registration systems. 
H.R. 1, the underlying bill, includes 
the Voter Registration Modernization 
Act, which requires that all Americans 
have access to online voter registra-
tion, a significant expansion of this 
service in many parts of the country. 
Voter online registration can be quick, 
easy, and convenient. It also poses sig-
nificant risks for those same citizens 
by increasing the cyber-infrastructure 
requirements at all levels of govern-
ment 
and 
introduces 
cybersecurity 
challenges in areas that have not pre-
viously had online registration. 
We are all familiar with the concept, 
if it goes on a network, it can be 
hacked. Data breaches pose a real 
threat to Americans’ privacy, to their 
financial security. We have seen time 
and again how poor digital hygiene, or 
insufficient cybersecurity, have cre-
ated new vulnerabilities to Americans’ 
personally identifiable information. 
Madam Speaker, Americans deserve 
to know how this mandate in the un-
derlying bill will impact their local 
voting systems and their personal pri-
vacy. Many areas of the United States 
have successfully implemented online 
voter registration, and that could be 
great for those voters. However, many 
election 
precincts, 
and 
even 
some 
States, do not have adequate infra-
structure or resources to ensure proper 
protection of the personally identifi-
able information that is required to be 
collected to register to vote. 
This amendment would provide our 
constituents information to either pro-
vide a sense of security that their voter 
data will be properly protected or will 
serve as a warning as to how this could 
impact their voting system. 
Madam Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ on 
both votes. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, al-
though I do not support the underlying 
bill, H.R. 1, these five amendments 
brought before us improve what is oth-
erwise a bad bill. I think these studies 
would be helpful, in particular, to our 
servicemembers. 
And we recognize the unique position 
the State of North Dakota has in our 
system. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on the en bloc, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, as I 
said in my opening remarks, we believe 
these amendments are reasonable ones. 
I support them, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The en bloc amendments were agreed

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
AMENDMENT NO. 14 OFFERED BY MS. BUSH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 14 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
9. 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 141, line 19, strike ‘‘unless such indi-
vidual is serving a felony sentence in a cor-
rectional institution or facility at the time 
of the election’’. 
Page 143, strike line 9 and all that follows 
through page 144, line 2 and insert the fol-
lowing: 
(2) DATE
OF
NOTIFICATION.—The notifica-
tion required under paragraph (1) shall be 
given on the date on which the individual is 
sentenced for the offense involved. 
Page 145, strike lines 1 through 8 and insert 
the following: 
(ii) in the case of any individual com-
mitted to the custody of the Bureau of Pris-
ons, by the Director of the Bureau of Pris-
ons, on the date in which the individual is 
sentenced. 
Page 145, strike lines 17 through 24 (and re-
designate the succeeding provisions accord-
ingly). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Ms. BUSH) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Missouri. 
Ms. 
BUSH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
St. 
Louis and I rise to offer an amendment 
to H.R. 1, the For the People Act, 
which would restore the right to vote 
to our community members serving 
sentences for felony convictions. 
I want to extend my deepest grati-
tude to Congressman JONES for this 
partnership. 
Madam Speaker, America does not 
love all of its people, and we see that. 
Right now, more than 5 million people 
are legally barred from participating in 
our elections as a result of criminal 
laws. That is, 1 in 44 Americans, 500,000 
Latinx Americans, 1.2 million women, 
and 1 in 6 Black folks. 
Madam Speaker, this cannot con-
tinue. Disenfranchising our own citi-
zens, it is not justice. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
LOFGREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Missouri 
(Ms. BUSH) for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I would just like to 
note that the underlying bill provides 
that once individuals are re-enfran-
chised, they may vote. And H.R. 1 also 
ends the practice of so-called prison 
gerrymandering, where persons who 
are incarcerated are counted where 
they are incarcerated not in their 
home districts, even though they can-
not vote there. 
Now, I know different people have 
different viewpoints on this amend-
ment. The committee Democrats have 
no official position, but speaking just 
personally, I feel there is merit to this 
amendment. If you are going to count 
the individuals for redistricting pur-
poses in their prisons, then I think 
they have to be allowed to vote there, 
or else that entire scheme is com-
pletely wrong. 
Madam Speaker, further, it occurs to 
me that those who oppose it think that 
denying a vote would somehow be a de-
terrent to criminal conduct. In fact,

empowering people to be full citizens 
encourages rehabilitation. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. TIFFANY), my colleague and 
good friend. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, there isn’t enough 
time to talk about all of the crazy 
things in this bill, so I am going to 
focus on the one provision I think 
takes the cake and something that 
should have been put in this bill. 
The bill before us today, which I am 
calling the politician enrichment act, 
will force American taxpayers to fund 
partisan political ads. 
You heard that right, Mr. and Mrs. 
America. All those negative, mud-
slinging campaign ads you see on TV 
every election cycle—the ones you 
can’t stand—well, now you have to pay 
for them, too. In fact, you get to chip 
in $6 of your money for every $1 the 
politicians raise. 
How is that for the swamp taking 
care of its own? 
But, wait, there is more: 
This 
new 
taxpayer-funded 
gravy 
train will expand a loophole in cam-
paign finance law that is already big 
enough to drive a fully-loaded Brinks 
truck through. 
Madam Speaker, thanks to a gen-
erous carve-out in Federal law, Mem-
bers of Congress are able to funnel 
campaign contributions into their per-
sonal bank accounts by simply hiring 
their spouses as campaign consultants. 
In fact, one high profile Member of 
the body—this body—exploited this 
loophole to the tune of $2.8 million in 
the last election cycle. 
You think it is bad now, Joe and 
Jane Taxpayer? Just wait until you see 
how bad it gets when you are paying 
for it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
filed an amendment with the Com-
mittee on Rules to close this loophole, 
one based on a bipartisan proposal in-
troduced by Mr. SCHIFF and supported 
by Mr. HOYER, Mr. CLYBURN, and 
Speaker PELOSI in the 110th Congress. 
But the Committee on Rules chose not 
to allow us to vote on that amendment 
today. 
I wonder why? 
b 1145 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
vindicate the right to vote as precisely 
that, a constitutional right, not a 
privilege, a right. 
It is a travesty that our Nation’s 
laws do not fully protect the right to 
vote. The reason, of course, is white su-
premacy. Over 150 years ago, during 
Reconstruction, we tried to build a 
multiracial democracy in this country. 
For the first time, Black people won 
seats in this very Chamber, but white 
supremacists were not having it. So, 
like today’s Republican Party, they de-
vised ways to deny Black people the 
right to vote. 
Madam Speaker, thanks to the 15th 
Amendment, they could not expressly 
prohibit Blacks from voting, so they 
barred prisoners from voting. Then 
they invented excuses to put Black 
people in those prisons. It took 70 years 
for a Black candidate to win a seat in 
this Congress from the South again. 
These Jim Crow laws remain on the 
books. They are why over 5 million in-
carcerated people are barred from vot-
ing. These people look like me. They 
are parents. They are children. They 
fall in love. They make mistakes just 
like we do. They are citizens of the 
United States of America just like we 
are, and they deserve the right to vote. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. MURPHY), who is my col-
league and good friend. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in ardent 
opposition to H.R. 1, the alleged For 
the People Act. 
Before I do that, I want to speak to 
the recent amendment submitted that 
would allow criminals, convicted fel-
ons, in this country to vote. I have 
traveled around the world. I don’t 
know any country in this world that 
allows criminals, convicted felons, to 
vote. That is not keeping them from 
committing their crime. It is called 
punishment. It is punishment for their 
crime. It is unconscionable to me we 
are actually debating some of these 
things that we debate on the floor now. 
Madam Speaker, the last election 
showed the Democrats’ true goals for 
reform, a way to permanently fed-
eralize the States’ elections away from 
Republicans. 
If someone would read the Constitu-
tion, it is a beautiful document. It 
talks about States making their own 
election law. This bill, if anything, 
should be referred to as the for the 
politicians act. 
Madam Speaker, let’s just look at 
the process before I lambast the policy. 
There were 183 amendments submitted, 
but only 56 were made in order. Of 
those 56, only eight were allowed by 
Republican Members. 
Thanks to the McGovern rule, Demo-
crats are continually able to submit 
rule bills on the floor without a com-
mittee markup—it is called the demo-
cratic process—without a markup or a 
hearing. 
Madam Speaker, policywise, things 
look even worse. This massive bill pro-
vides taxpayer money to finance in-
cumbents’ campaigns. It curbs free 
speech, significantly increases Federal 
bureaucracy and red tape, and creates 
a one-size-fits-all Federal election sys-
tem. 
Madam Speaker, our Founders pur-
posefully decentralized our election 
process to give States the authority to 
conduct a smooth and open election 
day. Get the Federal Government out 
of State and local affairs. Not every 
precinct is equal or is of the same com-
position. Eastern North Carolina is not 
the same, thank God, as California; 
Portland, Oregon; or Manhattan. 
Madam Speaker, furthermore, many 
of these changes were made without 
the input of State and local leaders 
who 
have 
the 
best 
on-the-ground 
knowledge. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, several organizations 
oppose this bill. I urge my colleagues 
on both sides to oppose H.R. 1 and sup-
port the Republican alternative, the 
Save Democracy Act. 
This is about our elections. This is 
what makes the United States different 
from everywhere. If we allow fraud in 
our electoral process, this Nation is 
lost. 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, may I 
ask how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 13⁄4 minutes remaining. 
The gentleman from Wisconsin has 1 
minute remaining. 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, let me 
just say, currently, Vermont, Maine, 
the District of Columbia, and the Com-
monwealth of Puerto Rico allow for in-
dividuals to vote who are incarcerated, 
just to be clear. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
because voting is a right that must be 
extended to all people, and, yes, that 
includes currently and formerly incar-
cerated individuals. 
Madam Speaker, in a country that 
has yet to fully make amends or pay 
restitution for its racist past, we must 
recognize that taking away the right 
to vote as punishment for a crime is di-
rectly tied to the racist, mass incarcer-
ation system that continues to wreak 
havoc on Black and Brown commu-
nities. 
The stripping of the right to vote of 
incarcerated people, especially Black 
folks, is directly connected to the rac-
ist past of our country, from slavery 
and Jim Crow laws to mass incarcer-
ation. It was done with intent, to dis-
enfranchise them for the most sacred 
right: to choose the people and policies 
that govern. 
Madam Speaker, people need to look 
it up. There are countries that allow 
formerly incarcerated people to vote. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. BOWMAN). 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, our 
friends, our neighbors, and our family

March 2, 2021 
members who are entangled in this in-
justice system did not lose their citi-
zenship, so they should not lose their 
right to vote. 
These are people from our commu-
nities, still connected strongly to our 
families, our schools, and our work-
places. As a result, they should not 
lose their right to vote. 
Their right to vote must be restored 
because these are individuals—people, 
not criminals—who can still think 
critically 
and 
creatively 
and 
con-
tribute to our democracy. Our democ-
racy will remain broken and sick and 
unhealthy until we heal by restoring 
the right to vote to our incarcerated 
individuals. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tive SARBANES and Representative LOF-
GREN, for their leadership on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, just to put it out 
there as a reminder, we are talking 
about actual people. We are talking 
about humanity. We are talking about 
access. We are talking about the right 
to vote. These are people. I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Bush-Jones Amend-
ment to H.R. 1, a critical amendment which 
clarifies that felony convictions do not bar any 
eligible individual from voting in federal elec-
tions, including individuals who are currently 
incarcerated. 
This amendment seeks to reverse discrimi-
natory voter restrictions that disproportionately 
affect the African American voting population, 
which continues to be targeted by mass incar-
ceration, police profiling, and a biased criminal 
justice system. 
Voting is a right of citizenship, not a privi-
lege any of us earns, and should not be con-
nected to punishment. 
Felon disenfranchisement laws were crafted 
with the intent to disenfranchise as many Afri-
can Americans as possible after the Civil War, 
and today, one in every 16 African Americans 
of voting age is disenfranchised, a rate 3.7 
times greater than that of non-African Ameri-
cans. 
According to PEW Research, over 10 per-
cent of the adult population in Texas was a 
felon as of 2010. 
Nearly 
5.2 
million 
Americans 
are 
disenfranchised while serving time behind 
bars. 
These Americans are full members of our 
civic life, and they have ties to their families 
and communities, engage in robust civic life, 
and many of them have been or will be re-
leased back into their communities. 
The white supremacists who championed 
such measures were very clear on their rea-
sons. 
Disenfranchising a specific group of people 
undermines democracy, and it does so with a 
particular impact on people of color. 
In many states, state disenfranchisement 
laws have explicitly racist origins, and it’s time 
to put this ghost of Jim Crow behind us. 
Many states have already begun to recog-
nize the right to vote for those serving time. 
Vermont and Maine are the only U.S. 
states, in addition to Puerto Rico, that allow all 
people with felony convictions, including those 
incarcerated, to vote. 
Alabama, Mississippi, and Alaska allow 
some people who are incarcerated to vote, de-
pending on their felony convictions. 
Additionally, Washington D.C. passed a 
measure just last year which allowed those in-
carcerated to vote in the November 2020 elec-
tion. 
This amendment is supported by a host of 
civil rights, racial justice, and criminal legal re-
form organizations, including the Leadership 
Conference, Demos, the Sentencing Project, 
the National Immigration Project, the National 
Council of Churches, and more. 
Madam Speaker, we must not allow our de-
mocracy to slide back into the worst elements 
of this country’s past, to stand idly by as our 
treasured values of democracy, progress, and 
equality are poisoned and dismantled. 
I urge all members to join me in supporting 
the Bush-Jones Amendment to H.R. 1. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
CHU). Pursuant to House Resolution 
179, the previous question is ordered on 
the amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Ms. BUSH). 
The question is on the amendment.

AMENDMENT NO. 19 OFFERED BY MR. RODNEY 
DAVIS OF ILLINOIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BLUMENAUER). It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 19 printed in part 
B of House Report 117–9. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I have an amendment at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Strike subtitle C of title III. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
need 
for 
this 
amendment is another example of this 
bill not being updated from last year. 
We have made huge efforts on cyber 
issues and successfully had an election 
year this year with no foreign inter-
ference. This is in large part due to the 
efforts of DHS and the Election Assist-
ance Commission. I even took part this 
summer in a tabletop exercise to pre-
pare for cyberattacks. 
Mr. Speaker, if we had considered 
this bill in committee, we could have 
talked about our success in this area 
during the last election. This is an-
other example of the Democrats not 
knowing what is in their legislation 
and rolling out their standard bill 
without a thoughtful review. 
Absolutely no one wants foreign in-
terference in our elections. 
Mr. Speaker, absolutely no one wants 
foreign interference in our elections, 
but the last thing we need to do is cre-
ate a commission with another layer of 
bureaucracy when we have programs in 
place that have been successful for our 
local election officials. It is because of 
some great work by CISA that we 
should be recognized. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, this amendment 
would violate separation of powers and 
attempt to control the judicial branch, 
threatening our independent courts. It 
is disappointing that this is the only 
amendment of mine and the other Re-
publican members of the committee 
that the majority Democrats allowed 
through. 
We submitted 25 amendments to re-
store the ability to run our elections to 
the States and localities that this bill 
takes away; eliminate the fund to pub-
licly finance campaigns using cor-
porate dollars and instead use that 
money for pandemic relief for the 
American people; prevent sitting Mem-
bers of Congress’ campaigns from bene-
fiting from this bill; protect Ameri-
cans’ First Amendment right, without 
fear of retaliation from the Federal 
Government; and the list goes on and 
on. 
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the ma-
jority did not allow these amendments 
to come to the floor. While I urge pas-
sage of this amendment, for those rea-
sons and many more, I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on the underlying legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment would 
strike subtitle C of title III, the elec-
tion security title in H.R. 1, which re-
quires the President to produce a na-
tional strategy for protecting U.S. 
democratic institutions. It also creates 
a 
national 
commission 
to 
protect 
United States democratic institutions 
to counter threats. 
In light of the evidence of foreign in-
terference in the 2016, 2018, and 2020 
Federal elections, the Federal Govern-
ment needs a coordinated approach to 
protect and secure our democracy. 
While our election infrastructure offi-
cials have said that the 2020 election 
was the most secure in history, we 
know it is not because our foreign ad-
versaries are no longer attempting to 
interfere in our elections. They will 
continue their efforts, and we must 
take steps to ensure our elections con-
tinue to be secure. 
This provision in H.R. 1 is important 
to that endeavor. The national strat-
egy will provide guidance on how to 
protect against cyberattacks, influence 
operations, disinformation campaigns, 
and other activities that could under-
mine the security and integrity of 
United States democratic institutions. 
The purpose of the national commis-
sion to protect the United States 
democratic institutions is to counter 
efforts to undermine democratic insti-
tutions within the United States. The 
national strategy and commission will 
be important to protecting the integ-
rity of our elections and preventing 
foreign interference in our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, we must stay vigilant. 
Our enemies are not resting, and nei-
ther are we. This provision is an impor-
tant part of the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment from the 
gentleman from Illinois. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. May 
I inquire as to how much time I have 
remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. There 
are 3 minutes remaining on each side. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the big problems 
that I see in this election arena is a bill 
that 2 years ago was written with the 
assistance of special interests before 
we were even sworn in to the 116th Con-
gress. It was announced and put for-
ward with every member of the major-
ity signing on as cosponsors the day we 
were all sworn in. 
That is not the process that the 
Democratic 
majority 
promised 
the 
American people when they gave my 
colleagues the privilege to serve in this 
majority. 
Mr. Speaker, here we go again. It is 
like Groundhog Day. Instead of intro-
ducing the same bill, they made some 
changes, which is great. Still, this is a 
problem of the nationalization of our 
elections. Also, it limits free speech. 
There was no negotiation with us, no 
markup in our committee, no ability 
for us to have a voice. 
Mr. Speaker, to top it off, none of us 
in the minority want any campaign 
dollars coming from corporations that 
are then laundered and then made into 
public funds through the Federal Gov-
ernment and then put in their own 
campaigns. We don’t want one dollar, 
let alone the limit now of $7.2 million 
that each and every person in this in-
stitution would be eligible to get into 
our own campaigns. That is not cam-
paign finance reform. That is not what 
my constituents want. That is the fur-
thest thing from what the minority 
wants. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
just note that I oppose this amend-
ment. I will wait until the next amend-
ment to go into the underlying bill. I 
think much of what has been said this 
morning and this afternoon is simply 
incorrect. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this 
amendment. 
It 
is 
a 
commonsense 
amendment that is going to protect the 
bipartisan work that our officials have 
done to protect Americans’ elections 
and address cybersecurity issues and 
foreign interference. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. The 
SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to 
section 3(s) of House Resolution 8, the 
yeas and nays are ordered.

PART

OF 
CONTRIBU-
TIONS TO POLITICAL COMMITTEES IM-
MEDIATELY PRIOR TO ELECTION 
SEC. 4131. DISCLOSURE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
POLITICAL 
COMMITTEES 
IMME-
DIATELY PRIOR TO ELECTION. 
(a) DISCLOSURE.—Section 304(a)(6) of the 
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 
U.S.C. 30104(a)(6)) is amended— 
(1) by redesignating subparagraphs (D) and 
(E) as subparagraphs (E) and (F); and 
(2) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the 
following new subparagraph: 
‘‘(D)(i) A political committee, including a 
super PAC, shall notify the Commission of 
any contribution or donation of more than 
$5,000 received by the committee during the 
period beginning on the 20th day before any 
election in connection with which the com-
mittee makes a contribution or expenditure 
and ending 48 hours before such an election. 
‘‘(ii) The committee shall make the notifi-
cation under clause (i) not later than 48 
hours after the receipt of the contribution or 
donation involved, and shall include the 
name of the committee, the name of the per-
son making the contribution or donation, 
and the date and amount of the contribution 
or donation. 
‘‘(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a 
pledge, promise, understanding, or agree-
ment to make a contribution or expenditure 
with respect to an election shall be treated 
as the making of a contribution or expendi-
ture with respect to the election. 
‘‘(iv) This subparagraph does not apply to 
an authorized committee of a candidate or 
any committee of a political party. 
‘‘(v) In this subparagraph, the term ‘super 
PAC’ means a political committee which ac-
cepts donations or contributions that do not 
comply with the limitations, prohibitions, 
and reporting requirements of this Act, and 
includes an account of such a committee 
which is established for the purpose of ac-
cepting such donations or contributions.’’. 
(b) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendment 
made by subsection (a) shall apply with re-
spect to elections occurring during 2022 or 
any succeeding year. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN) and the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) each will control 
10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bloc of amend-
ments provides important additions to 
the bill. 
Among the amendments in the bloc 
is an amendment from the gentleman 
from Arizona that promotes language 
accessibility for voting and ensures 
that notices at polling locations take 
into consideration factors including 
the languages spoken in the jurisdic-
tion. 
An amendment from the gentleman 
from Arizona and the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico improves voting ac-
cess for individuals with disabilities in 
the Four Corners region of Arizona, 
New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah by 
making technical fixes to the Protec-
tion and Advocacy for Voting Access 
provisions. 
An amendment from the gentlemen 
from Rhode Island and Wisconsin im-
plements a recommendation of the 
Cyberspace Solarium Commission to 
ensure the security of our elections and 
resilience of our democracy by creating 
the position of a senior cyber policy ad-
viser at the Election Assistance Com-
mission. 
An amendment from the gentle-
women from Virginia and Florida pro-
hibits taxpayer funds from being added 
into the freedom from influence fund. 
During the 2020 election, Postmaster 
General DeJoy implemented sudden 
operational 
changes 
that 
disrupted 
timely mail services and the delivery 
of absentee ballots. An amendment in 
this bloc from the gentlewoman from 
Michigan ensures that can never hap-
pen again by prohibiting operational 
changes at the Postal Service for 120 
days before a Federal election. 
This bloc of amendments also in-
cludes an amendment from the gen-
tleman and gentlewoman from Min-
nesota that requires State election of-
ficials to undertake accessible public 
education campaigns to inform voters 
of any changes to election processes 
made in response to public emer-
gencies. 
b 1345 
Finally, it includes four amendments 
from the gentlewoman from the Virgin 
Islands. One of these amendments ap-
plies Federal voter protection laws to 
the territories, including protection 
against 
voter 
intimidation, 
inter-
ference, and voting by aliens in Federal 
elections in the territory; that would 
be noncitizens. 
Another of these amendments per-
mits each of the territories to provide 
and furnish statues in Statuary Hall. 
That is an important amendment that 
allows each of the territories represen-
tation among the statues in the Halls 
of Congress. These amendments rep-
resent long, overdue recognition of im-
portant contributions of the terri-
tories. 
Mr. Speaker, I support these amend-
ments, and I urge their adoption, and I 
reserve the balance of my time, 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition at this 
point in time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON), 
another star of the historic diverse 
class of new freshmen. 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 1. 
The 2020 election and its aftermath 
were chaotic and harmful to our de-
mocracy. We should be working hard in 
this Chamber in a bipartisan way to re-
store faith in our electoral process. 
I have heard my colleagues across 
the aisle say that this bill would help 
to transform our elections. They are 
certainly right about that. H.R. 1 is the 
largest expansion of the Federal Gov-
ernment’s role in our elections, ever. 
It would take away States’ constitu-
tional authority to run their own elec-
tions. When I was in the Iowa State 
House, we worked hard to secure our 
election system, to safeguard against 
fraud, and to ensure that only legal 
votes were counted. Our goal in Iowa 
was to make it easy to vote and hard to 
cheat, and we succeeded in doing that. 
But H.R. 1 would overrule those ef-
forts, and it would force Washington’s 
one-size-fits-all policy and voting prac-
tices on Iowans. H.R. 1 would also send 
taxpayer dollars directly to political 
candidates. That is right. The Federal 
Government would send your money to 
fill the campaign coffers of a politician 
you might not even agree with. 
This bill would take authority away 
from Iowans to run their own elections 
while Democrats here in Congress are 
also laying the groundwork to overturn 
the official election results in Iowa’s 
Second Congressional District, where 
the votes have been counted, re-
counted, and certified for Congress-
woman MARIANNETTE MILLER-MEEKS. 
Our Constitution is clear, States de-
termine elections, not Congress. 
H.R. 1 will harm and it will not pro-
tect the integrity of our elections. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues in this 
body to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), my colleague 
in the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia, the chair of the Committee on 
House Administration, for the work 
that she has done. 
It is interesting to hear a speech by 
the former President, following in his 
tradition of denial of a fair election, 
but announcing that he believes that 
there should be only 1 day for an elec-
tion to take place, denying essential 
workers, not recognizing the disaster 
of COVID–19, denying rural voters and 
minority voters the opportunity in 
some stressful time to be able to vote. 
H.R. 1 considers all factors in ensur-
ing the empowerment of all voters in 
this Nation. The United Methodist 
Church offered these words, ‘‘We hold 
governments responsible for the pro-
tection of the rights of the people to 
free and fair elections . . . the form 
and the leaders of all governments 
should be determined by exercise of the 
right to vote guaranteed to all adult 
citizens.’’ 
This legislation recognizes that and 
recognizes that the dark days of 4 
years ago of voter suppression and op-
position to minorities voting, the lack 
of empowerment, are over with in H.R. 
1. And I want to support amendments 
22 and 23, to ensure that individuals 
with disabilities can vote. 
I want to make sure that young peo-
ple on college campuses are not dis-
criminated against, as they have been 
in my community with polling places 
that they have had to stand in long 
lines. 
I want to make sure as well that 
women are protected in privacy with 
making sure that their addresses are 
not printed so that they will not be 
subjected to assault, sexual assault, 
and violation of privacy. H.R. 1 pro-
vides an opportunity for justice and

the right way to vote, I ask for the rec-
ognition of that. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE), the 
subcommittee chair that has oversight 
of elections on the Oversight Com-
mittee. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
listen, the American people expect and 
deserve free and fair elections. They 
deserve to have one legal vote cast and 
one legal vote counted, but H.R. 1 turns 
all of our election process upside down. 
It upends our entire election system. 
Why are we doing this? 
As my friend mentioned, on the Over-
sight Committee, the entire year last 
year in Oversight, my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle tried to push 
H.R. 1 because of COVID, and we saw 
what that did in our elections this past 
year, it totally created chaos. But now 
we want to nationalize it. 
The worst thing in the world that can 
happen is for the Federal Government 
to nationalize our election system. 
Part of what is in here is universal 
mail-in ballots to everyone on the 
voter registration files. What a dis-
aster. We know those files are probably 
10 percent inaccurate. So we are going 
to have millions of illegal voters re-
ceive live ballots. Then there is zero 
voter ID associated with this. 
Why in the world would we want no 
voter ID, unless this is some sort of 
scheme to give illegal voters the oppor-
tunity to vote without any proof of 
who they are, that they are legal? 
This is an absolute disaster, and bal-
lot harvesting is a part of this, re-
stricting the right of States to run 
their own elections. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendments, 26 
and 27, to H.R. 1. The Postal Service 
has been an essential service for the 
American people for centuries, written 
into our Constitution. And as we take 
steps to expand voting by mail, we 
must ensure that the Postal Service is 
not weaponized to restrict its mission 
to promptly and effectively deliver 
mail. 
My first amendment would require 
the Postal Service to appoint an elec-
tion mail coordinator to assist election 
officials. My second amendment would 
prohibit the Postal Service from enact-
ing any new operational change that 
would restrict the prompt delivery of 
mail materials 4 months before the 
election; 
specifically, 
targeting 
re-
moval of the collection boxes and sort-
ing boxes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support these amendments as part of 
this en bloc. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, can I inquire again how much 
time is remaining? We have a lot of 
folks who want to talk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 61⁄2 minutes 
remaining and the gentlewoman from 
California has 5 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER), a member of this his-
toric freshman class. 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to H.R. 1 today. 
Despite its name, this act is not for 
the people. It is for the politicians 
seeking power. 
East 
Tennesseans 
and 
Americans 
want election reform that increases the 
security and integrity of our election, 
and they are demanding it. Instead, 
this bill erodes the public confidence in 
our elections. This bill picks D.C. bu-
reaucrats over State and local officials, 
and it uses hard-earned tax dollars to 
fund political campaigns by a 6-to-1 
fund-matching provision. Now, let me 
repeat that. It is a 6-to-1 fund-match-
ing provision. 
I am sure my fellow east Tennesseans 
agree this is a waste of money. 
Wouldn’t you rather have our tax 
dollars used to fund measures to safely 
open schools or to expand critical ac-
cess to rural broadband? 
These are the priorities we need to 
fund, not political power grabs and 
public financing of our own political 
campaigns. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose, and I urge my 
colleagues to oppose H.R. 1. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
Americans want to know that govern-
ment officials don’t have conflicts of 
interest swaying their decisions. 
For example, did they fundraise from 
an industry that they will regulate? 
Might they take it easy on that indus-
try as a result? 
H.R. 1 requires high-level officials to 
disclose if they have solicited or made 
political contributions to PACs, polit-
ical nonprofits, or industry trade asso-
ciations. I thank Congressman DEUTCH 
for authoring this provision. 
My amendment expands this piece to 
cover chiefs of mission to ensure that 
officials 
representing 
our 
country 
abroad, such as ambassadors, are free 
from conflicts of interest, too. We 
should feel confident that people en-
trusted to represent the United States 
are there not because of political dona-
tions, but because they are the best 
person for the job. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, the en bloc, 
and H.R. 1. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), I 
may live to regret it, but I will do it 
anyway, my good friend. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member. This bill that is 
supposed to be for the people, one of 
the things it is really supposed to do, 
we have been told, you know, this is 
going to eliminate foreign interference 
with our bill. They have been preach-
ing on it for years. There was the 
whole Russia hoax, all these other 
things. It turns out there hasn’t been 
foreign interference, but the friends 
across the aisle were not serious, and 
are not serious with this bill about 
eliminating all foreign interference. 
In fact, that is why I filed an amend-
ment that would have addressed that. 
They got loopholes big enough to drive 
several trucks through. So we took 
care of it in my amendment. My 
amendment says, ‘‘Each State shall en-
sure that no foreign entity carries out 
any role in the administration of elec-
tions for Federal office in the State, in-
cluding providing, maintaining, pro-
gramming, operating, storing, or com-
piling any of the equipment, software, 
supplies, or information used in the ad-
ministration of the election. 
‘‘A nonprofit organization may not 
carry out any activities related to vot-
ing or elections for public office in a 
State if the organization accepts any 
funds from a foreign entity.’’ 
And then it defines foreign entity, 
where it covers everybody and every-
thing that is not American. 
b 1400 
So we have got this amendment that 
would completely plug the loopholes 
that the Democrats have so that for-
eigners can’t continue to influence the 
election. 
And what do they do? 
They say: 
Your amendment, we don’t want it. 
It is not in order. We are not even 
going to give you a vote on it. 
They are not serious about elimi-
nating foreign interference, and that is 
a shame. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, may I 
ask how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 4 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Illinois has 31⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of my amendment, 
which would bolster the mandate that 
no voter be forced to wait longer than 
30 minutes to cast their ballot. 
In my home State of North Carolina, 
it is not uncommon for voters to wait 
in line for hours on election day to 
vote. Long wait times come at a cost. 
For people who work or have family 
obligations, it is challenging to stand 
in line for hours to exercise their con-
stitutional right to vote. 
Sadly, North Carolina is not alone. In 
recent elections, we have witnessed 
lengthy wait times at polling locations 
across the country. Research shows 
that people who live in poor and more 
diverse neighborhoods are more likely 
to wait over an hour or more to vote. 
Long wait times amount to voter 
suppression, plain and simple, by caus-
ing voters to leave before voting, by

discouraging people from voting in fu-
ture elections, and by decreasing con-
fidence in our democratic process. 
Mr. Speaker, we must end this tactic 
of voter suppression, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote for this amendment. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA), 
who was my fellow classmate in the 
113th Congress. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, Amer-
ican voters deserve to have confidence 
in their election process. This is not it. 
A few basic principles: voter ID so we 
know who is showing up and who is re-
ceiving ballots; a clean set of voting 
rolls so the people who are eligible—of 
all types, the people who are truly eli-
gible in this country—are voting from 
their proper domicile; we know they 
are citizens; and we know they are the 
right age. 
But somehow we find these things to 
be problematic and somehow this is 
going to be suppressing votes—what, 
for people being eligible to vote being 
the actual voters that they live in the 
right State, that they are the right 
age, and that they are citizens? 
It is ridiculous the lengths that the 
Democrats want to go to upset our 
election process and the confidence 
people have in it. It could be really 
quite simple. Have the election end on 
election night. In one place in my dis-
trict, they found a box 30-something 
days after the election. They had to 
open back up the certified election to 
take care of a box that had drop-off 
ballots in it. 
We are making a farce out of our 
elections in this country. And this, by 
nationalizing them, will make it that 
much worse. In the Constitution, the 
Congress established the States will 
run their elections. We only need to 
have very narrow guidelines for how 
our Federal ones are conducted. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. PHILLIPS). 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, Con-
gress should be making it easier for 
Americans to vote, not harder. That is 
why I am pleased to support H.R. 1, es-
pecially in the face of reprehensible ef-
forts all around the country to dis-
enfranchise legal American voters. 
I also believe that when a State 
changes its election procedures, they 
have a responsibility to ensure that 
voters are informed of those changes. 
That is why I wrote an amendment to 
H.R. 1 called the Voter NOTICE Act, 
which simply requires States to form 
public outreach to ensure that voters 
are proactively made aware of their 
voting rights. 
As we are too well aware, Mr. Speak-
er, bad actors are all too eager to ex-
ploit 
uncertainty 
and 
spread 
disinformation to mislead Americans 
and divert the will of the people. The 
antidote is truth, and the Voter NO-
TICE Act will deliver it. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I keep bringing up our his-
toric freshman class. I have got an-
other member of that historic fresh-
man class who, frankly, has made his-
tory, too, in her short time here. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1. 
While we are talking about voter sup-
pression and long lines, I would like to 
point out that there is real voter sup-
pression that happens right here in 
Congress. Many Members of Congress 
have to stand in long lines to enter the 
Chamber going through metal detec-
tors, emptying our pockets, and being 
treated very disrespectfully. That is 
real voter suppression, and it is a 
shame that it happens right here on 
the House floor. 
Standing in line to vote is not sup-
pression. It is just part of the voting 
process, just like people stand in line 
to buy groceries in the grocery store. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, may I ask how much time is 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
Two minutes to solve the problems of 
this bill clearly are not enough. 
Mr. Speaker, the amendments in this 
bloc continue the Democrats’ efforts to 
attack our constitutional system by 
nationalizing our elections and attack-
ing the First Amendment. Even the 
Speaker herself said earlier on the 
floor that this body should consider al-
tering the First Amendment. That is 
unbelievable. 
Mr. Speaker, as my friend, Mr. 
LOUDERMILK, highlighted earlier, any 
action by Congress in this space must 
be limited to correcting highly signifi-
cant and substantial deficiencies. 
I had teams out in the field working 
under our constitutional authority, as 
the House of Representatives, as offi-
cial election observers from October 
through February, to investigate and 
observe the last election. We saw that 
there were certainly many bumps in 
the road and policy changes that many 
States should consider to run better 
elections. That is without a doubt. But 
there was nothing in 2020 that rose to 
the level of nationalizing our election 
system. These are State issues, and 
Congress—this body—must not act un-
constitutionally in this space. 
Further, these amendments would 
also threaten free speech and punish 
those who work to comply with the law 
with even larger amounts of paperwork 
simply to provide information already 
required by law. I see absolutely no 
reason for duplication in the Federal 
Government. It is big enough as it is. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge 
rejection of these amendments, which 
would continue the majority’s push to 
nationalize our elections and centralize 
their administration in Washington, 
D.C., and they will continue to be al-
lowed to forward their full frontal at-
tack on the First Amendment, just as 
the Speaker offered earlier today on 
this floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that 
this amendment is worth supporting. It 
makes improvements to the underlying 
bill. I was really stunned to hear a 
comparison between Members of Con-
gress going through metal detectors— 
because some Members have, in viola-
tion of the rules, carried weapons on to 
the House floor—and voters having to 
wait 8 hours to get to the polling 
booth, which actually happened last 
November. 
It is important that American voters 
have access to the polls to cast their 
vote and to have that lawfully cast 
vote counted as cast. That is what this 
is about. 
I listened to my colleague and my 
friend, Mr. DAVIS, complain about the 
constitutional basis for H.R. 1. But he 
has also introduced bills like H.R. 6882, 
H.R. 3412, and H.R. 7905, which would 
all require States to do certain things 
with respect to how they conduct elec-
tions. 
I might disagree with the policies in 
those bills, but they all cite Article I, 
Section 4 of the Constitution as the 
basis for their legitimacy. So to say 
that we cannot improve the elections 
in America under Article I, Section 4 
simply is not correct. 
So we will have more debate as these 
proceedings on H.R. 1 conclude, but I 
will close with this: Please do support 
the en bloc amendments. It improves 
the bill, and we will, hopefully, be pass-
ing H.R. 1 to make America an even 
greater place in the near future. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of En Bloc Amendment No. 3 
to H.R. 1, which includes the Gallego Amend-
ment, an important contribution to H.R. 1 that 
makes a long overdue technical fix to the Help 
American Vote Act to ensure and to protect 
the right to vote for Native Americans and oth-
ers living with disabilities in the four corners 
region of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Col-
orado. 
Specifically, this amendment will extend 
funding under the Protection and Advocacy for 
Voting Access program to the Native Amer-
ican Disability Law Center to ensure people 
with disabilities in the region can fully partici-
pate in the electoral process. 
Too often, voters in this region drive hours 
to reach their nearest polling place, only to 
find that the ballot is not accessible to them 
due to inadequate disability training, ADA ac-
cessibility, or other impediments to the con-
stitutional right to vote. 
Voting is a right of citizenship, and every 
polling place should be adequately equipped 
to serve those with disabilities. 
Nearly 15 percent of those eligible to vote in 
Texas are persons with disabilities—almost 3

million 
people—and 
lack 
of 
accessibility 
causes people with disabilities to vote at lower 
rates than the general population. 
According to a study by the Government Ac-
countability Office, nearly two-thirds of the 137 
polling places inspected in 2016 had at least 
one impediment to people with disabilities. 
These impediments included: the accessible 
voting machine not being set up and powered 
on, malfunctioning earphones, lack of wheel-
chair accessibility, and less privacy than 
standard voting stations. 
Many people with disabilities cannot mark 
paper ballots without assistance, so they rely 
on special voting machines, but untrained poll 
workers have discouraged the use of acces-
sible voting machines, leaving voters with dis-
abilities behind. 
People with disabilities continue to report 
barriers including a lack of accessible election 
and registration materials prior to elections, 
lack of transportation to polling places, and 
problems securing specific forms of identifica-
tion required by some states. 
Mr. Speaker, it is long past time to keep our 
promise for a fully inclusive electoral process 
in Native and rural communities, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote for En Bloc Amendment 
No. 3 to H.R. 1. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time

March 2, 2021 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. RON ESTES 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I was not 
present for Roll Call vote No. 50 on agreeing 
to the Resolution (H. Res. 179) on H.R. 1 (For 
the People Act) and H.R. 1280 (George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Acting). Had I been 
present, I would have voted ‘‘no.’’

INTRODUCTION OF THE PUBLIC 
BUILDINGS RENEWAL ACT OF 2021 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Revitalizing Economies, Hous-
ing, and Businesses (REHAB) Act of 2021. 
This legislation incentivizes equitable transit- 
oriented development by providing a 15 per-
cent tax credit for expenses related to the re-
habilitation of buildings that are more than 50 
years old, including adjacent development on 
the same block, provided that the project is 
within a half-mile of an existing or planned 
public transportation center. The legislation 
also provides a bonus credit of 25 percent for 
expenses associated with the provision of af-
fordable housing and public infrastructure. 
While existing community development in-
centives do an excellent job at targeting their 
segment of the market, there is a noticeable 
gap in equitable transit-oriented development. 
As more Americans move to urban areas, 
communities face difficult decisions in accom-
modating increased congestion and afford-
ability concerns, all while seeking to keep their 
carbon footprint light. By focusing on the reha-
bilitation of existing assets that are near public 
transportation, projects are lighter on the land 
and residents can more easily access jobs 
and services via transit. Encouraging afford-
able housing investments in transit-rich areas 
will transform areas that are often some of the 
least affordable. Taken together, provisions in 
the REHAB Act encourage preservation, ac-
cessibility, and affordability and will create 
more livable communities. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to include this legis-
lation in an upcoming infrastructure investment 
package.

HONORING LORA MILES 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious woman of God, Pastor Lora Miles. 
Pastor Miles has shown what can be done 
through hard work, dedication and a desire to 
teach the word of God. 
Recently, Pastor Miles was recognized by 
the Yazoo County Regional Facility Chap-
laincy’s Department as its first African Amer-
ican female prison minister. 
Pastor Miles is a native of Elizabeth, Mis-
sissippi, and currently serves as the Pastor of 
the Everlasting Love Ministry in Leland, MS. 
She has been involved in ministry work for 
nearly 30 years. It was after the passing of her 
son in 2014 that she hit the ground running in 
prison ministry—a safe haven to encourage 
her heart. She started her prison ministry at 
the Washington County Correctional Facility of 
Greenville, where she gives messages of 
hope and faith to hundreds of female inmates. 
In 2019, Pastor Miles decided to expand her 
prison ministry to Yazoo County, where she 
now serves as the first female to minister at 
the Yazoo County Regional Correctional Facil-
ity, an all-male state facility. 
Through her services in Yazoo County, in-
mates continue to receive Christ and inspira-
tions through her messages of love. On Friday 
nights, at the Yazoo County Regional Correc-
tional Facility, there are not enough chairs to 
accommodate all the men who are eager to 
attend the church services led by Pastor 
Miles. She is making a significant impact at 
the facility, and the lives of many men are 
being transformed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Pastor Lora Miles for her 
dedication to serving others and giving back to 
her community.

IN RECOGNITION OF GREGORY J. 
WASHINGTON ON THE OCCASION 
OF HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to extend my personal congratula-
tions and best wishes to Mr. Gregory J. Wash-
ington, a New Orleans native, on the occasion 
of his retirement this year. 
Greg began his forty-year career in the en-
ergy sector as a ‘‘roughneck’’ in the fields of 
south Louisiana during his high school sum-
mer breaks. For those of us who know Greg, 
it seems obvious that he would find success in 
the industry that offered him his first job. After 
graduating from Southern Methodist University 
in 1978, Greg started with Texaco as a 
‘‘landman’’ in New Orleans and went on to be-
come the State Mineral Board Representative 
from 1986 to 1990. Greg was later promoted 
to be Texaco’s Senior Public and Government 
Affairs Representative for Louisiana and was 
eventually asked to transfer to Washington, 
D.C., for what he thought would be a short- 
term assignment. After many years with the 
Texaco and Chevron Washington offices, 
Greg has decided to hang up his hard hat for 
good and enter retirement. 
Throughout his career, Greg has shown his 
strong Louisiana work ethic and his ‘‘come 
early, stay late’’ attitude. He has always been 
eager to share his love of Louisiana and our 
culture with everyone he meets. He has con-
tinued to approach his work with an enthusi-
astic and positive outlook. As a result, he is 
well known and well liked, and his decision to 
retire certainly leaves a void that will be hard 
to fill. I know all his friends and colleagues will 
miss him dearly. 
Greg and Cassandra, his lovely wife of 40 
years, are looking forward to spending more 
time together in their well-earned retirement. I 
expect that this will surely include more time 
in his hometown of New Orleans. 
I wish Greg and Cassandra all the best.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 90TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL 
LIBRARY 
SERVICE 
FOR 
THE 
BLIND AND PRINT DISABLED 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to recognize a great ac-
complishment—the 90th anniversary of the 
National Library Service for the Blind and Print 
Disabled. In my role as ranking member of the 
Committee on House Administration, I’ve had 
the great opportunity to learn about the many 
services the Library of Congress provides— 
not only Congress, but to all Americans. One 
of its most notable and inspiring is the Na-
tional Library Service, or NLS, an institution 
committed to serving readers with disabilities 
with the mission of ensuring ‘‘that all may 
read’’. 
The history of the NLS began in 1897, with 
the seventh Librarian of Congress, John Rus-
sell Young, established a reading room for the 
blind that included more than 500 books and 
music items in raised characters. By 1913, 
Congress began to require that one copy of 
each book be made in raised characters and 
available at the Library of Congress for edu-
cational use, but the collection had its limits, 
as it was only available to visit in-person. 
In 1930, Representative Ruth Pratt of New 
York and Senator Reed Smoot of Utah led a 
movement to make the collection more acces-
sible across the country, leading to the pas-
sage of the Pratt-Smoot Act, which, on March 
3, 1931, created what we know today as the 
National Library Service. In the 90 years since 
then, the NLS has expanded its service to 
reach children and individuals with additional 
types of physical and reading disabilities 
through not only books, but the world’s largest 
accessible music materials collection. 
But this 90th anniversary isn’t only a cele-
bration of the NLS, it is a celebration of the

central role local libraries play in connecting 
constituents across our entire country to its 
collection. In my own state, NLS and the Illi-
nois State Library Talking Book and Braille 
Service provide service to nearly 10,000 indi-
viduals and institutions in Illinois. This includes 
more than 1,000 individual patrons and institu-
tions in my district. 
Madam Speaker, the National Library Serv-
ice for the Blind and Print Disabled is one of 
those magical programs that exemplify the 
good our government can do for all Ameri-
cans, especially our sisters and brothers with 
disabilities. Today, I give them my congratula-
tions on their 90th anniversary, my apprecia-
tion of their commitment to access and lit-
eracy, and my thanks for all they do.

HONORING ADAM POLITZER 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Adam Politzer upon his 
retirement from a distinguished 20 year career 
in service to the City of Sausalito. 
Adam was born and raised in Sausalito, and 
he graduated from Tamalpais High School. 
His career in local government began in 1987 
as a recreation manager in Palo Alto. He later 
joined the City of Sausalito in 2000 as a parks 
and recreation director and quickly moved up 
the ranks to become the City’s chief adminis-
trator. Upon his retirement Adam was the 
longest serving City Manager for Sausalito. 
During his tenure with the City Adam pro-
duced substantial improvements to the quality 
of life for the City’s residents and visitors. 
Among his numerous achievements, Adam 
successfully led efforts to revitalize Robin 
Sweeney Park, Dunphy Park, Martin Luther 
King Jr. Park, and Southview Park; oversaw 
the consolidation of the Sausalito Fire Depart-
ment with the Southern Marin Fire District; and 
managed development projects for new public 
safety buildings. Adam was also valued by the 
city council and staff for his skilled steward-
ship of taxpayer dollars and helping the City 
maintain financial stability throughout eco-
nomic challenges including the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Over the years Adam became a strong 
mentor for the next generation of municipal 
leaders, launching the Southern Marin Man-
agement Academy to help train aspiring public 
servants. Adam is well-known by Sausalito 
and Marin County residents, business owners, 
and colleagues for his thoughtful leadership 
and willingness to thoroughly explore and pur-
sue the best solutions to complex problems. 
Adam’s commitment to the community of 
Sausalito has been, and will continue to be, 
productive and enduring. Madam Speaker, I 
respectfully ask that you join me in expressing 
gratitude to Adam for his extensive public 
service and extending to him congratulations 
on his retirement and best wishes on his next 
endeavors. 
IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
NATIONAL 
SMALL 
BUSINESS 
WORKPLACE 
SOLUTIONS WEEK 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of designating the week of 
March 28, 2021, through April 3, 2021, as Na-
tional Small Business Workplace Solutions 
Week. While small businesses are always de-
serving of our support and recognition, this is 
particularly true during the current COVID–19 
pandemic. 
The workplace solutions industry is com-
prised of small businesses across all 50 
states. During the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
Department of Homeland Security deemed 
workplace solutions businesses essential as 
they 
assisted 
hospitals, 
nursing 
homes, 
schools, law enforcement, and local govern-
ments. Additionally, the workplace solutions in-
dustry provided critical support to businesses 
which were forced to move from in-person of-
fice to home offices. The industry’s work with 
both the public and private sectors proved to 
be crucial. 
Like other small businesses, the workplace 
solutions industry has struggled over the 
course of the pandemic. The industry is grate-
ful for PPP loans and the other federal assist-
ance it has received, but recovery is still slow. 
Many small businesses face the prospect of 
closing their doors for good unless the eco-
nomic picture continues to improve. Times 
have been tough for small businesses, but we 
can finally see a bright future beginning to 
peak over the horizon. The Congressional 
Budget Office projects over 4 percent GDP 
growth this year. In other words, our economy 
is ready to come roaring back as soon as we 
beat the pandemic. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in support of the workplace solu-
tions industry. The resolution to designate 
March 28, 2021 through April 3, 2021, as Na-
tional Small Business Workplace Solutions 
Week is a signal of support for this recovering 
industry and small businesses across the 
United States. Finally, I want to thank Amer-
ica’s small businesses for their dedication and 
sacrifice during the COVID–19 pandemic, and 
I wish them God’s blessings as they continue 
to serve the American people.

REMEMBERING BONNIE L. 
PITTMAN 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Bonnie L. Pittman, of Ra-
venna, Ohio, who passed away on February 
16, 2021 at the age of 82. 
Bonnie was born January 2, 1939, in 
Gassville, Arkansas, to parents Floyd and 
Florence (McFarlan) Chambers. She married 
the love of her life, John, on February 15, 
1958. 
Mrs. 
Pittman 
managed 
Tucaway 
Lake 
Campground with John, where she touched 
many lives and hearts. Bonnie was a member 
of the First Christian Church and enjoyed trav-
eling. Most of all, she was a people person 
who loved her family and friends. 
Bonnie is survived by her husband, John, as 
well as her children Sue (Patrick) Pittman, 
Laurie J. Pittman, Jamie (Keith) Fletcher, John 
(Vicki) Pittman Jr., Roger (Gail) Pittman, her 
five grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, 
her sisters Blanche Hart and Betty Bell, her 
sister-in-law Jill Chambers, along with many 
nieces, nephews, and countless friends who 
she considered family. She was preceded in 
death by her parents and her brother Floyd 
‘‘Butch’’ Chambers, Jr. 
I am proud to be friends with Bonnie’s 
daughter, Judge Laurie Pittman. My deepest 
condolences go out to Judge Pittman, Bon-
nie’s entire family, and to all whose lives she 
touched.

RECOGNIZING 
LINDA 
EIDINGER 
AND HER SERVICE TO THE FORT 
LAUDERDALE COMMUNITY 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor Linda Eidinger for her years of dedi-
cated service to the South Florida community. 
After twenty years as a union officer in Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania, Linda moved to South 
Florida where she has lived a life of commu-
nity service and activism. Linda is a proud 
mother and grandmother, and her roots in 
union work inspired her to continue to fight on 
behalf of working families everywhere. 
As president and an active member of many 
civic organizations, Linda engaged her com-
munity and brought people together to ad-
vance noble causes. As a leader in the Amer-
ican Association of University Women and the 
Organization for Rehabilitation through Train-
ing, Linda was a strong believer in the power 
of education and worked to ensure that every-
one has access to an education to enable 
them to succeed in life. 
Linda was also president of the Fort Lauder-
dale Democrats By The Sea Club where she 
fought for working families and other causes 
while making simple meetings enjoyable and 
memorable. Linda was an excellent moderator 
and brought a wide range of thoughtful speak-
ers to various events and meetings. Environ-
mental stewardship is also an important cause 
to Linda, who participated in and organized 
events such as recycling drives, beach clean-
ups, and other activities to protect the local 
environment. 
Linda has been a selfless, dedicated, and 
positive member of her family and her commu-
nity, fighting for important causes like edu-
cation, environmental protection, and so many 
others. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Linda Eidinger, and her 
service to Fort Lauderdale and Florida’s 22nd 
Congressional District.

HONORING DENISHA GRAY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious woman, Ms. Denisha Gray. Denisha 
has shown what can be done through hard 
work, dedication and a desire to educate War-
ren County youth. 
Denisha, a resident of Vicksburg, Mis-
sissippi, earned her bachelor’s degree in gen-
eral studies from Alcorn State in 2013. In 
2018, she earned her master’s degree from 
Louisiana Tech University. 
Denisha Gray, a second-grade teacher at 
Dana Road Elementary School, said it is im-
portant that, through her teaching, her stu-
dents are connected to the world around 
them, and that the lessons they learn connect 
them to that world. Before joining the staff at 
Dana Road Elementary, Gray taught one year 
at Vicksburg Intermediate School, her first with 
the Vicksburg Warren School District. Prior to 
that, she spent one year as a fourth-grade 
teacher and four years as a third-grade teach-
er at Wright Elementary School in Tallulah. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Denisha Gray for her 
passion and dedication to serving Warren 
County and her desire to make a difference in 
the community.

SUPPORTING 
THE 
CBC’S 
LIVING 
HISTORY 
EVENT 
AND 
CON-
DEMNING THE CAPITOL INSUR-
RECTION OF JANUARY 6, 2021 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
discuss Black History Month and the insurrec-
tion against our Capitol Building on January 6, 
2021. 
Since 1926, America has celebrated Black 
History in some form. It started as a week and 
now it is a month to honor the achievements 
of Black Americans throughout our nation’s 
history. Schools and organizations conduct 
seminars and events to highlight the month. It 
is a positive way to acknowledge the power of 
diversity in the growth of our country. 
But there are still those in America who dis-
agree with diversity. They want to return to a 
time when only a small minority of Americans 
were allowed to have rights and the full pro-
tections of the U.S. Government. They believe 
that ‘white is right’ and everything else is 
wrong. Luckily, their numbers have been de-
creasing across the country during the last few 
decades. 
Unfortunately, they are not going quietly. 
The forces of white supremacy were strength-
ened and emboldened by former President 
Trump. In the last few years, they have acted 
out in ways both public and private. They were 
the ones who attacked our nation’s Capitol 
Building on January 6th. They were the ones 
who wanted to ‘‘hang’’ former Vice President 
Mike Pence. They were the ones who brought 
a Confederate flag, one of the nation’s fore-
most symbols of hate and prejudice, into the 
Capitol Building. And they forced elected offi-
cials of both political parties, Republicans and 
Democrats, to flee for their lives on that fateful 
day. 
We know that white nationalists have be-
come empowered to commit acts of hate like 
this one nationwide because they had support 
in the White House. In 2019, the total number 
of hate crimes rose to 7,312 and marked the 
fourth increase in the past five years. We 
know that white supremacy-supporting domes-
tic terrorists pose a greater threat to our na-
tion’s peace and security than foreign terror-
ists. And we know how to fight and defeat 
white nationalism. The question is when are 
we going to defeat it for good?

HONORING 
THE 
36TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE ALAMEDA CONTRA 
COSTA LINKS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the Alameda Contra Costa 
Chapter of the Links (ACCL) for their 36 years 
of service throughout California’s 13th Con-
gressional District and the country. 
Based in Oakland, California, the Alameda 
Contra Costa Chapter of the Links supports 
local service agencies serving primarily low-in-
come, inner-city youth and their families in 
Contra Costa and Alameda counties through 
volunteer and fundraising efforts. 
The 
Links, 
Incorporated 
was 
originally 
founded in 1946 and national membership 
now consists of more than 15,000 professional 
women of color. These women are committed 
to serving as ‘‘volunteers to enriching, sus-
taining and ensuring the culture and economic 
survival of African Americans and other per-
sons of African ancestry.’’ 
The Alameda Contra Costa Chapter of the 
Links was founded in 1985. Its members and 
leaders have worked since its founding to help 
East Oakland and the youth who live there 
through community service programs. 
In 1996 ACCL established the Community 
Service Program called ‘‘Respect Yourself.’’ 
This program’s aims are to ‘‘Respect Your 
Health, Respect Your Knowledge, Respect 
Your Family and Community, and Respect 
Your Creativity and Intuitiveness.’’ Through an 
oral health initiative targeting children, a car-
diovascular health initiative with the American 
Heart Association targeting African American 
women, educational activities for young chil-
dren focused on STEAM, financial literacy, 
English literacy, international affairs, anti-bul-
lying, environmental stewardship, and the arts, 
the ‘‘Respect Yourself’’ program has bettered 
the health and education of many in our com-
munity. Over the years, ACCL has been able 
to serve over 2,800 young Oakland students. 
On February 26th, 2021, ACCL will hold its 
25th annual Respect Yourself Youth Sympo-
sium. The Symposium directly supports young 
students in Oakland and exposes the students 
to thought leaders and educational content in 
STEM and health studies. 
On behalf of California’s 13th Congressional 
District, I want to extend my sincere congratu-
lations on this important milestone of 25 years 
of the Respect Yourself Youth Symposium 
and 36 years of service. I thank the Alameda 
Contra Costa Chapter of the Links for dedica-
tion to excellence and to our community. I 
wish them continued success in working to 
better the lives of the children and women of 
color of California’s 13th Congressional Dis-
trict.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
RURAL 
WIND ENERGY MODERNIZATION 
AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2021 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Rural Wind Energy Mod-
ernization and Extension Act of 2021. This 
commonsense proposal builds on the success 
of the small wind investment tax credit by as-
sisting farmers, ranchers, and small busi-
nesses in offsetting the up-front costs of de-
veloping and owning distributed wind turbines. 
Small wind turbines are commonly installed 
on residential, agricultural, commercial, indus-
trial, and community sites and can range in 
size from a few-hundred-watt turbine at a re-
mote cabin to a 5-kilowatt turbine at a home 
to a multi-megawatt turbine at a manufacturing 
facility. These systems allow farmers, ranch-
ers, and other consumers to cut their energy 
bills and, at times, sell power back into the 
grid. 
While this technology has grown in the past 
decade, federal policy to promote deployment 
of distributed wind has failed to keep up. Cur-
rent law has constrained nameplate capacity 
in distributed wind projects and years of short- 
term extensions have created a significant 
amount of uncertainty in the distributed wind 
market. The Rural Wind Energy Modernization 
and Extension Act would increase the existing 
100-kilowatt limitation to 10 megawatts and 
provide long-term certainty for distributed wind 
projects for decades to come. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to include this legis-
lation in an infrastructure investment package.

HAPPY 
90TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
TO 
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY SERV-
ICE FOR THE BLIND AND PRINT 
DISABLED 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
acknowledge the 90th anniversary of the Na-
tional Library Service for the Blind and Print 
Disabled (‘‘NLS’’). Established by a 1931 Act 
of Congress, the NLS administers a free na-
tional library program that provides braille and 
recorded materials to people who cannot see 
or handle traditional print materials through a 
national network of cooperating libraries. Since 
its establishment, the NLS has remained a 
leading force in the national effort to increase 
the access of those with low vision, blindness, 
or other print disabilities to reading materials 
and a shining example for similar programs 
around the world. 
Initially established as a program to serve 
only blind adults, the NLS was expanded in 
1952 to include children, in 1966 to include in-
dividuals with other physical disabilities that 
prevent reading traditional print materials, and 
in 2016 to permit NLS to provide refreshable 
braille displays. Under a special provision of 
the U.S. Copyright Law, and with the permis-
sion of authors and publishers of works not 
covered by that provision, NLS selects books 
and magazines for full-length publication in 
braille, e-braille, and digital audio format. 
These materials (along with free playback 
equipment needed to ready audiobooks and 
magazines) are circulated to patrons within the 
United States and its territories and to Amer-
ican citizens living abroad. The program con-
tinues to expand in both its reach and capa-
bilities, 
now 
allowing 
for 
instantly 
downloadable digital audio and e-braille mate-
rials via the NLS mobile applications and al-
lowing patrons to request accessible materials 
in a wide range of languages from libraries 
around the world. 
The banner atop the NLS webpage an-
nounces the service’s noble mission: ‘‘That All 
May Read.’’ Over the past 90 years, the NLS, 
which updated its name from the National Li-
brary Service for the Blind and Physically 
Handicapped in 2019, has been steadfast in 
its efforts to accomplish this mission, ensuring 
that no person be denied the joy of literature 
and reading because of blindness or disability. 
The impact of the NLS over the past 90 years 
has been vast and far-reaching and I look for-
ward to witnessing what the NLS will accom-
plish with another 90 years. On behalf of all of 
us in this House, congratulations to the Na-
tional Library Service and to those who work 
tirelessly to make the NLS’s outstanding mis-
sion a reality. Many thanks for all their good 
work.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BARBARA 
ANSELMO CHIFICI 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of New Orleans restauranteur 
Barbara Anselmo Chifici who passed away on 
January 23, 2021. She is survived by her 
seven children, twelve grandchildren, and two 
brothers. 
Barbara 
reached 
national 
recognition 
throughout her successful career in the cul-
inary industry. For almost 40 years, she 
owned Deanie’s Seafood restaurants, which 
she operated with her late husband Frank 
Chifici. Known for their overflowing fried sea-
food platters, Deanie’s restaurants became a 
New Orleans staple and were featured on nu-
merous local and national news programs. 
Barbara was also well-known for giving back 
to her community. From creating a crawfish 
and music festival that benefited local charities 
and serving as president of a local philan-
thropic organization to her numerous positions

FOR COMMUNITY FOOD BANK 
HON. TOM MALINOWSKI 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor Ridge High School Thespian 
Troupe 7742. 
As part of New Jersey Thespians’ Trick or 
Treat so Kids Can Eat program, Troupe 7742 
collected close to 170 pounds of food for the 
Somerset County Food Bank. Their donation 
efforts came at a critical time for many New 
Jerseyans who are utilizing community food 
banks now more than ever before. 
Ridge High School Thespian Troupe 7742 is 
comprised of students who not only excel in 
the arts, but who also strive to make a dif-
ference in their own neighborhood. Their con-
tributions here demonstrate just that. Thank 
you to Troupe 7742 for the work they do to 
enrich and give back to the Somerset County 
community.

HONORING THE LATE FATHER 
JASSO 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the legacy of a pillar of our 
Fort Worth community—Father Jasso. Father 
Stephen Jasso was a Man of God who used 
his position to advocate for the city’s poor and 
powerless even during his last years when he 
fought a debilitating disease. 
Father Jasso served the North Side Catholic 
parish of All Saints in Fort Worth faithfully and 
tirelessly for 23 years before his retirement in 
2018. Born in Waco, Texas, Father Jasso was 
one of several children born to the late Do-
mingo and Leonor Jasso, who came to Texas 
from Mexico. Before entering the Franciscan 
order in 1957, he served in the U.S. Army dur-
ing the Korean War, earning the rank of ser-
geant first class. 
After completing his seminary studies in 
Mallorca, Spain, and Rome, Italy, he was or-
dained a Catholic priest in 1965. During his 
early years in the priesthood, he traveled to 
Peru where he spent four years as a mis-
sionary. His next assignment took Father 
Jasso to Mexico where he spent 24 years 
serving parishes. 
In 1994, at 62 years old, he was named 
pastor of All Saints Catholic Church in Fort 
Worth in 1994, where he also served on many 
local boards and commissions, including the 
United Way board and the Task Force on 
Racism. During this lifetime, Father Jasso also 
served as a vigilant advocate for immigrants 
and the disenfranchised in our North Texas 
community. 
Let us live up to Father Jasso’s legacy and 
ensure we spend every day living a selfless 
life devoted to those less fortunate.

HONORING MRS. PATRICIA 
JOHNSON LOVE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a business-
woman and community leader, Mrs. Patricia 
Johnson Love. 
Patricia Dale Johnson Love graced the 
earth in September of 1969. She is the third 
youngest of many siblings. She was born to 
the late Lucious and Jessie Mae Johnson. On 
a gloomy day, while she was only 3 years old, 
in March of 1972, the youngest of the siblings 
was born. After her mother gave birth to her 
little sister, she hemorrhaged and transitioned. 
Ten years later, when she was only 13 years 
old, her father passed away. Although Love 
was too young to understand, life for her was 
about to be a challenge. 
She spent her childhood in different homes. 
Not all of them were good, but she and her 
siblings made the best of them. She would 
often think about the mile walk to the well to 
carry water, with no shoes on, on a rock road. 
She and her siblings trusted God every step of 
the way. 
Love graduated from Quitman County High 
School in 1987. She attended Northwest Com-
munity College and graduated with an asso-
ciate degree in Basic Computer Programming. 
While at Northwest, she made her money by 
fixing young ladies’ hair in the dormitory. After 
a year of employment, she decided to save 
her money and attend Cosmetology school. 
Love began her career as a licensed cos-
metologist in 1993 at Lewis Beauty Salon in 
Marks, Mississippi. In 2002, she stepped out 
on faith and opened her own salon. She want-
ed to give new stylists a place to start their ca-
reer. Her favorite clients were the elderly. She 
would pick up those who needed a ride and 
take them home. She never gave it a thought 
because their children would be at work. 
Sometimes, she would even have to take 
them to the grocery store or the post office be-
fore driving them home. 
In 1994 during the ice storm, God gave her 
a gift. She named her gift, Altrevia Rashun

Jackson. Love became a single parent when 
her child was only four years old. During this 
time, she became ill. For three years, she suf-
fered with Crohn’s disease. She kept the faith 
and prayed that God will let her raise her 
child. After surgery in 1999, she was healed. 
In 2013, she married Donnie Ray Love. 
Donnie was also a businessman, who inspired 
her to pursue other avenues. Together, they 
have 4 children. 
After her daughter graduated from high 
school, she was hesitant on completing col-
lege. Love knew her daughter’s capabilities, 
and she knew she had become distracted. 
She challenged her to a bachelor’s degree. 
She attended Mississippi Valley State Univer-
sity and asked her daughter to attend. She 
knew that she had bitten off a bit much, but 
there was no turning back. The bond between 
the two grew even more, as they traveled to 
school together at night. 
In 2017, she graduated with a bachelor’s 
degree in Business Administration and a con-
centration in Occupational Management. She 
wanted a mother and daughter graduation, but 
her daughter was not quite ready. She fin-
ished the next year in 2018. 
Love’s professors thought it would be great 
for her to pursue a master’s degree. She knew 
it would be difficult, but not impossible. In 
2019 she received her master’s degree in 
Business Administration, with honors. 
Patricia understands the full phrase of ‘‘it 
takes a village to raise a child.’’ She sees 
guiding children as a community effort. She 
loves children and wishes she could save 
them all. Therefore, she enjoys spending her 
spare time volunteering and tutoring at the Vil-
lage in Marks, Mississippi. 
Love is the owner and operator of PJs 
Salon for 21 years and has served 28 years 
in the business. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Patricia Johnson Love 
for her dedication in serving her community.
