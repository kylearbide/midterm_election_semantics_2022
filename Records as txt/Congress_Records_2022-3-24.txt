Let us pray. 
Mighty 
God, 
in 
turbulent 
times 
throughout our history, You have an-
swered us. Answer us again. Save and 
strengthen the Ukrainian people. Lord, 
deliver them from their peril. Grant 
them the desires of their hearts, and 
make their plans succeed. May they 
shout for joy when they receive Your 
answers to their many prayers. 
Today, continue to provide our law-
makers with the wisdom to accomplish 
Your purposes on Earth. May they 
refuse to boast about their strength

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
well, it was another busy and produc-
tive evening here on the Senate floor. 
Yesterday, we confirmed another six 
judges to important positions on the 
Federal bench and all of them, I am 
happy to say, with bipartisan support. 
We now have confirmed 56—56—judges 
under this Democratic Senate major-
ity, and I thank my colleagues for 
their patience and for keeping the pace 
moving here on the floor last night. 
There are two judges I am especially 
proud to have confirmed. First, we con-
firmed Hector Gonzalez to serve as a 
district judge for the Eastern District 
of New York. Mr. Gonzalez is a most 
deserving, most qualified, and most in-
spiring individual to serve as a judge. 
Born in Cuba, raised in Queens, he is 
the 
embodiment 
of 
the 
American 
dream. 
We also finally confirmed a judge 
who has inspired me for more than a 
decade—Ali Nathan, now confirmed as 
circuit judge for the Second Circuit. 
When I first met her, I thought, ‘‘Here 
is someone who is truly special,’’ and I 
still believe that to this day. And, to 
boot, she increases the diversity of the 
court as only the second-ever openly

March 24, 2022 
lesbian to sit on the Second Circuit— 
open lesbian on the Second Circuit. I 
believe that is in the whole Federal ju-
diciary. We will check that. 
The Second Circuit is one of the most 
consequential courts in the entire 
country, calling for only the best of the 
best to sit on the bench, and Ali Na-
than fits the bill. 
I am glad both of these nominees 
were confirmed with bipartisan sup-
port. 
On the legislative front, the Senate is 
pressing ahead on bipartisan competi-
tion legislation to lower costs, boost 
American manufacturing, and fuel an-
other generation of American scientific 
ingenuity. 
For the information of all Senators, 
last night, I moved to file cloture on 
both the substitute amendment and 
the underlying legislation for our com-
petitiveness legislation. As I have said 
previously, our plan has been to take 
up the House-passed version of this leg-
islation and amend it with the exact 
same language the Senate approved 
last summer with bipartisan support, 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act. 
Once we pass this amended bill, it 
will go back to the House, and they 
will be able to request a conference 
committee. As convoluted as the Sen-
ate process often is, the bottom line is 
that the train is moving forward when 
it comes to this bill. 
A lot of Senators from both parties 
have worked for years to see legisla-
tion like this reach the President’s 
desk. If the United States is to thrive 
in the 21st century, we need to keep 
our competitive edge in science and in-
novation, and this bill would do just 
that. We must continue growing Amer-
ican jobs. We must continue to lower 
the price of critical technologies like 
semiconductors, and this bill would do 
just that as well. 
We have a few more steps to take be-
fore we reach a conference, but support 
of this bill is strong and bipartisan, 
and the process is moving forward. 
RUSSIA 
Madam President, on PNTR, negotia-
tions are continuing on passing bipar-
tisan legislation to strip Russia of per-
manent normal trade relations with 
the United States. This legislation is 
greatly needed and timely as President 
Biden continues meeting with Euro-
pean 
allies 
regarding 
Putin’s 
des-
picable war on Ukraine. 
The House passed PNTR by 424 to 8— 
424 to 8—and the Senate absolutely 
should pass it with equally strong bi-
partisan support. There is no justifica-
tion to delay a popular policy that 
would deal a heavy, heavy blow on 
Putin’s Russia, especially given that it 
got such strong Republican support, in-
cluding from Leader MCCARTHY in the 
House. 
Yesterday, I am happy to say, my 
team and I had a productive series of 
talks with Senators CRAPO, WYDEN, 
MANCHIN, and the White House. We 
reached an agreement with Senator 
CRAPO to move forward on PNTR as 
soon as we can, while addressing oil 
ban legislation separately. That way, 
the PNTR legislation can go right to 
the President’s desk. 
I hope the rest of my colleagues will 
get with the program quickly so we can 
send PNTR legislation to the Presi-
dent’s desk as soon as possible. We 
need a little more work, but we are 
close to passing this urgent legislation. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Madam 
President, 
finally, 
on 
SCOTUS, after 3 marathon days of 
speeches and questions and answers, 
Judge Jackson’s public testimony be-
fore the Senate Judiciary Committee 
has concluded. 
After watching the judge weather 3 
long days before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, my respect and my admi-
ration for her have never been higher. 
There is not a shred of doubt in my 
mind that she merits confirmation to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Once again, a handful of Members on 
the other side—not all, just a handful— 
tried to smear the judge with mis-
leading and downright false accusa-
tions. Once again, the judge remained 
poised, thoughtful, and strong in her 
answers. 
As Senator BOOKER said yesterday, 
no amount of cynicism and nastiness 
could overshadow that Judge Jackson’s 
nomination is a cause for celebration. 
She is not only a historic nominee; she 
is one of the most qualified nominees 
to ever come before the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Yesterday, 
Chairman 
DURBIN
an-
nounced that the Judiciary Committee 
will meet on Monday afternoon to 
begin the process of reporting Judge 
Jackson’s nomination out of com-
mittee. There is nothing in Judge 
Jackson’s record suggesting that the 
committee should have difficulty re-
porting her nomination out. Once the 
committee concludes its work, I will 
move to have her nomination come to 
the floor in short order. The Senate is 
on track to have Judge Jackson con-
firmed as Justice Jackson by the end of 
this work period. 
I commend Judge Jackson for her ex-
cellent testimony over the course of 
this week. It is not easy to endure 3 
days of testimony with the entire Na-
tion watching, but Judge Jackson has 
erased any doubt that she is brilliant, 
she is beloved, and she belongs—un-
questionably belongs—on the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday, I said I hoped the second 
day 
of 
Judge 
Jackson’s 
responses 
would provide more clarity on some 
vital 
questions. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
nominee’s answers trended the other 
way. Regarding the Court as an institu-
tion, the nominee continued to reject 
the examples of Justices Ginsburg and 
Breyer. She refused to denounce par-
tisan Court packing. On judicial philos-
ophy, the judge continued to deflect ac-
tually basic questions. 
The lack of candor is especially trou-
bling since the President sent us a 
nominee with no meaningful written 
record on constitutional matters. For 
more than 8 of Judge Jackson’s 9 years 
on the Federal bench, she was a trial 
judge on the district court. As the 
nominee herself explained on Tuesday, 
that role neither requires a particular 
talent for constitutional interpretation 
nor gives judges much of a chance to 
exhibit one. She deflected a question 
about judicial philosophy by explaining 
that such questions do not often occur 
to her on the lower court. 
District court records alone shed lit-
tle light on what kind of Supreme 
Court Justice someone might be. 
Now, Judge Jackson’s current post 
on the DC Circuit is a much closer ana-
log. The problem is, she has held that 
position for less than a year and has 
only published two opinions. Justice 
Gorsuch had authored 212 circuit court 
opinions before he was nominated to 
the Supreme Court. Justice Kavanaugh 
had written 306. Senators had an unbe-
lievable wealth of writings to examine. 
As to Justice Barrett, in just 3 years on 
the Seventh Circuit, she had already 
written 91 appellate opinions, not to 
mention her many academic writings 
on constitutional law. Judge Jackson 
has written a total of two circuit court 
opinions—just two. 
The only real body of evidence before 
the Senate is her record as a trial 
judge. Like I mentioned, those rulings 
communicate very little about the 
judge’s approach to big-picture ques-
tions of interpretation. But to make 
matters worse, Judge Jackson declined 
to answer basic questions about those 
rulings. Senators asked about clear 
patterns in the judge’s criminal sen-
tencing decisions. The nominee de-
flected by saying every case is unique. 
So Senators tried to examine one case 
at a time. Then the nominee said she 
couldn’t recall details. So Senators 
tried to supply the details. Then the 
nominee stonewalled and said no one 
case can fully capture a judge’s record. 
This made up an endless circle of eva-
sion. Judge Jackson wouldn’t address 
broad patterns in her rulings because 
she said it was unfair—unfair—for Sen-
ators to zoom out, and she wouldn’t 
discuss specific cases because she said 
it was unfair for Senators to zoom in. 
Since the only real body of evidence 
before the Senate is Judge Jackson’s 
trial records, Senators asked why she 
consistently opposed weak sentences 
for certain crimes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1759 
March 24, 2022 
The nominee then ducked the ques-
tion over and over. She blamed Con-
gress for giving her that discretion in 
the first place. Both the nominee and 
then Chairman DURBIN kept repeating 
that if Senators wanted to guarantee 
harsher penalties, we could mandate 
them. 
That is true, but it is a non sequitur. 
Senators wanted to know why Judge 
Jackson used the discretion she actu-
ally did have in the specific ways she 
chose to use it. The Senators were try-
ing to understand what this nominee 
does with discretion when she has it. 
But, again, the nominee would not 
answer. She kept blaming the mere ex-
istence of her discretion for her deci-
sions to go soft on criminals, when she 
could have just as easily used that dis-
cretion to be tough. We basically had a 
nominee saying that: If Senators want 
me to be tough on crime, you will have 
to change the laws to force me—force 
me—to do it. 
In several egregious instances, from 
child exploitation to fentanyl traf-
ficking, the nominee used especially 
unusual and creative legal moves that 
stretched the bounds of the judicial 
role. In the nominee’s own words, she 
simply has a ‘‘policy disagreement’’ 
with parts of the sentencing law. 
Evidently, the judge’s personal policy 
views change how she applies the law. 
Finally, I understand some Demo-
cratic Senators held a press conference 
yesterday to complain that Repub-
licans’ questions were too tough. 
Of course, nobody could have less 
credibility to police the fine details of 
confirmation hearings than our Demo-
cratic colleagues on the Judiciary 
Committee. The last 48 hours were a 
dry and friendly legal seminar com-
pared to the circus that Democrats in-
flicted on the country just a few years 
back. 
The American people know it is not 
asking too much to ask a Federal judge 
legal questions about her record. I just 
wish the Senate had gotten more an-
swers. 
UKRAINE 
Madam President, now on a different 
matter, today, President Biden is over-
seas meeting with America’s closest 
European allies as Vladimir Putin’s 
war in Ukraine enters its second 
month. 
He is engaging with a Europe that 
has been profoundly changed. NATO al-
lies have watched a neighbor invaded 
by an aggressive Russia. Some, like 
Germany, 
are 
ending 
30 
years—30 
years—of post-Cold War neglect for 
military modernization and energy se-
curity. 
I am glad that, as I urged last week, 
the President’s itinerary will include 
not just Western Europe, but also Po-
land. His presence on the eastern flank 
will send an important message. Of 
course, the most concrete way to sup-
port Ukraine is with greater commit-
ments of lethal aid. Ukrainian forces 
can win this fight. 
Let me say that again. Ukrainian 
forces can win this fight. But they need 
more weapons, more ammunition, more 
fuel, and they need it all as fast as pos-
sible. 
The allies and partners who are help-
ing equip Ukraine also need replen-
ishing their own arsenals. But the fight 
has highlighted shortcomings in both 
our current stockpiles of critical weap-
ons and munitions and our industrial 
capacity to produce more quickly. 
As other NATO members wake up to 
the importance of long-term invest-
ments in defense, America should lead 
by example. We have to meet the mili-
tary requirements that come from 
being a superpower facing growing 
threats to our global interests: sus-
tained increases in defense spending, 
deeper inventories of critical weapons 
systems and munitions, less redtape, 
work with industry to make our devel-
opment and production systems more 
nimble. 
This will not only help us meet the 
growing requirements of our military 
but also ensure we can be a reliable 
supplier of weapons and munitions to 
our allies and our partners. 
As the Washington Post reported just 
yesterday, recent events have caught 
our defense industrial base napping. 
Here is the quote from the Post: 
[W]eapons manufacturers weren’t geared 
up to make antitank and antiaircraft arms 
at a wartime pace. While the United States 
had 13,000 Stingers in its stockpile before the 
invasion, there were no plans to produce 
more en masse . . . Militaries in Europe that 
have given their Stingers and antitank mis-
siles to Ukraine now want to refill depleted 
stocks, creating competition for new units 
rolling off the assembly line. 
So President Biden already has real 
power to address this himself. The De-
fense Production Act was created dur-
ing a period of tense competition with 
Russia to bolster production of critical 
military 
supplies. 
The 
exact 
cir-
cumstance we are in right now. 
Ironically, the far left has demanded 
the President invoke the Defense Pro-
duction Act for everything but—every-
thing but—its central purpose. They 
don’t want to use the Defense Produc-
tion Act to bolster defenses, but, rath-
er, to force taxpayer money into re-
newable energy schemes that are not 
ready 
for 
prime 
time. 
Democrats 
should be using the Defense Production 
Act to literally produce more defenses, 
but they want, instead, to use it to spin 
up some more Solyndras. 
Of course, the real solution for global 
energy concerns is not throwing money 
into finicky technologies that them-
selves rely on Russian and Chinese sup-
ply chains. It is to unshackle U.S. en-
ergy producers. We can help meet Eu-
rope’s needs by increasing American 
crude and LNG exports, but our Euro-
pean friends will have to make nec-
essary sacrifices to wean themselves 
off of reliance on Russia. 
Putin’s war of aggression reminds us 
the so-called international order is not 
self-enforcing. The relative Pax Ameri-
cana that has lasted for the better part 
of a century does not—not—sustain 
itself automatically. American leader-
ship remains in very high demand. 
Putin’s unprovoked war has further 
discredited the small pockets in both 
of our political parties who want Amer-
ica to pull back from the world stage, 
who excuse the behavior of tyrants, 
who think it would be prudent and sen-
sible to cede vast spheres of influence 
to Russia and China. There is nothing 
remotely prudent or sensible about 
handing over entire regions of the 
world to these thugs. 
The national security interests of the 
United States have never stopped at 
our own borders, and they certainly do 
not today. We are a superpower with 
worldwide interests requiring a world-
wide presence and a worldwide network 
of allies and partners. American power 
will not preserve itself. American secu-
rity will not protect itself. American 
interests will not uphold themselves. 
And America’s partners will not lead 
themselves. 
This awesome responsibility falls on 
the shoulders of the President of the 
United States, the leader of the free 
world. President Biden has an oppor-
tunity as soon as he returns from Eu-
rope to begin charting the right course 
for America and the West. 
On Monday, his administration will 
submit his budget request for the next 
fiscal year. We will see if the President 
finally commits to investing in a fu-
ture of strong American leadership. 
Our global challenges are not par-
tisan issues; they are American issues. 
I sincerely hope that the Commander 
in Chief of our Armed Forces submits a 
defense budget request that reflects 
this reality. 
The world is dangerous and getting 
smaller. America must not shrink from 
the challenge, but rise and meet it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
Biden border crisis continues. 
In February, U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection encountered 164,973 indi-
viduals attempting to cross our south-
ern border illegally—a 63-percent in-
crease from a year ago and the highest 
February number in more than 20 
years. Border encounters in February 
over the past decade or so have gen-
erally been low, with numbers far 
under 100,000—but not since President 
Biden was inaugurated. Almost from 
the day the President took office, our 
Nation has been experiencing an un-
precedented border surge. 
In fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol 
encountered more than 1.7 million indi-
viduals attempting to cross our south-
ern border—the highest number ever 
recorded. We have had 12 straight 
months of border encounters in excess

March 24, 2022 
of 150,000. And these numbers only re-
flect individuals the Border Patrol has 
succeeded in apprehending. There is no 
question that many other illegal immi-
grants have crossed the border in the 
past year without being apprehended 
and have disappeared into the United 
States. 
The situation at our southern border 
is out of control—it is a security crisis, 
it is a humanitarian crisis, and it is an 
enforcement crisis. Our Border Patrol 
officers have done heroic work this 
past year, but they are stretched in-
credibly thin and are having to spend 
too much time caring for migrants and 
not enough time patrolling the border. 
This sharply increases the risk that 
dangerous individuals—from terrorists 
to drug smugglers to human traf-
fickers—will slip across our southern 
border and into the country unnoticed. 
And apart from the serious security 
concerns that go along with not know-
ing who is entering our country, allow-
ing this border crisis to continue also 
presents serious humanitarian con-
cerns. There is nothing compassionate 
about encouraging individuals to un-
dertake the dangerous journey to our 
southern border, to run the risk of ex-
ploitation and disease and exposure. 
Unfortunately, neither humanitarian 
nor security concerns have moved 
President Biden to meaningfully ad-
dress this border crisis. 
Every month, we see massive num-
bers of individuals attempting to cross 
our southern border, and every month, 
the White House just doesn’t seem to 
care. The President travels regularly, 
including regular weekends away from 
the White House, but he can’t seem to 
bring himself to visit the border and 
see the situation firsthand. 
It is a disturbing abdication of re-
sponsibility from the man charged with 
defending our Nation’s security. And 
let’s remember, the President isn’t just 
ignoring this border crisis; he is partly, 
if not largely, responsible for it. Imme-
diately upon taking office, the Presi-
dent took steps that weakened our Na-
tion’s border security. 
On his first day in office—very first 
day 
in 
office—President 
Biden 
re-
scinded the declaration of a national 
emergency at our southern border. He 
halted construction of the border wall. 
And he revoked a Trump administra-
tion order that called for the govern-
ment to faithfully execute our immi-
gration laws—all on the first day. 
And the President’s Department of 
Homeland Security also issued guide-
lines that same day pausing deporta-
tions except under certain conditions. 
The effect of all this was to declare 
to the world that the United States 
borders were effectively open. And Bor-
der Patrol numbers ticked up accord-
ingly, not surprisingly. 
And the President’s anti-border secu-
rity efforts didn’t end there. The Presi-
dent has significantly limited the abil-
ity of Immigration and Customs En-
forcement and Customs and Border 
Protection 
to 
enforce 
immigration 
laws. Deportations dropped precipi-
tously during fiscal year 2021, as did ar-
rests in the interior of the country. 
And earlier this week, the administra-
tion rescinded a 2019 rule expanding ex-
pedited removal for individuals here il-
legally. 
The administration is also, report-
edly, expected to end its title 42 
COVID–19 restrictions, which have pro-
vided for the immediate deportation of 
those who have crossed the border ille-
gally. The result is almost guaranteed 
to be an even larger surge at our south-
ern border, taking the situation from 
disaster to utter catastrophe. 
One media outlet reports that ‘‘De-
partment of Homeland Security intel-
ligence estimates that perhaps 25,000 
migrants already are waiting in Mexi-
can shelters just south of the border 
for Title 42 to end.’’ 
And there is no sign—no sign—that 
the administration has any substantive 
plan for how to deal with the resulting 
surge or how to deal with the enhanced 
criminal activity from drug smuggling 
to human trafficking that would likely 
accompany this influx. 
I get that President Biden would pre-
fer to pretend that this crisis at our 
southern border does not exist, but it 
does exist, and as President, he has the 
responsibility to address it. He needs to 
get serious about fulfilling that duty 
for the sake of our Nation’s security 
and for the sake of all those who are 
being encouraged by his lax immigra-
tion policies to undertake the dan-
gerous journey to our southern border.

UKRAINE 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I have 
lent my voice with my colleagues here 
in the U.S. Senate many times, here on 
the Senate floor, and elsewhere back 
home in Kansas in condemnation of 
Vladimir Putin’s attack, invasion, the 
death and destruction that his ac-
tions—his sole actions—have taken on 
the people of Ukraine. But those ac-
tions have consequences broader than 
just within the borders of the inde-
pendent country of Ukraine. I want 
today to bring awareness to a pressing 
consequence coming out of this inva-
sion, and that is hunger. 
A month ago, Russia, the world’s 
largest supplier of wheat, invaded 
Ukraine. Ukraine is the fifth largest

supplier of wheat. Together, they ac-
count for about 30 percent of global ex-
ports. This has exacerbated—tremen-
dously exacerbated—the already exist-
ing global food crisis, and it will only 
get worse. 
Coming from a State like Kansas, 
coming from Kansas, America’s largest 
supplier of wheat, I can tell you the ef-
fects this invasion will have on the sta-
bility of our ag markets here in the 
United States, and it should be alarm-
ing and could prove to be a cata-
strophic outcome for our global food 
supply. 
When there is a shortage of food, one 
of the things we can do is produce 
more. I would tell you that while the 
prices of agricultural commodities we 
grow in Kansas and across the United 
States have increased, I also would tell 
you that the input cost—the things 
that a farmer or a rancher has to pur-
chase in order to produce that crop, to 
produce that outcome—has increased 
even more dramatically. 
I would encourage the administration 
and this Congress to do more in regard 
to the cost of everything. The increas-
ing cost of food for the American con-
sumer and the absence of food for many 
around the world can be alleviated by 
increasing 
the 
supply—can 
be 
ad-
dressed at least in part by increasing 
the supply. 
To help do that, we need to make cer-
tain that we increase our own produc-
tion of oil and natural gas and of fer-
tilizer. The cost of fertilizer is a huge 
input cost for the Kansas farmer, and 
we still have tariffs on phosphates 
coming from Morocco. The Department 
of Commerce is contemplating tariffs 
on nutrients for fertilizer coming from 
Trinidad and Tobago. 
Increasing the cost of the inputs of 
producing food is a very damaging 
thing to occur and should stop. We 
need to reduce the price—slow the in-
crease in the price of diesel fuel and 
fertilizer. Natural gas is a major com-
ponent of producing fertilizer, and die-
sel fuel is hugely important. 
Again, we need to increase the sup-
plies of our fossil fuels to help the 
farmers survive during these times. 
Today, I wear on behalf of Kansans 
the sunflower pin. It is the State flower 
of our State, but it also is an impor-
tant symbol in Ukraine. It is a symbol 
of the resistance to Putin’s invasion. 
Just as Kansas is the breadbasket of 
America, Ukraine is the breadbasket of 
Europe. Ukraine, as I said earlier, is a 
large grain-producing country, not just 
in wheat but a top 10 global exporter of 
corn, sunflower oil, and other commod-
ities. It provides produce to markets 
not just in Europe but to some of the 
most vulnerable countries throughout 
the Middle East. 
According to the magazine The Econ-
omist, ‘‘The last time Egypt raised 
bread prices, the Soviet Union was still 
intact.’’ 
Food stability is essential to polit-
ical stability. We may recall that it 
was an increase in food prices that 
sparked mass protests throughout the 
Arab world a decade ago. 
As we have seen in the humanitarian 
disaster unfolding in Afghanistan and 
the developing crisis caused by the in-
vasion of Ukraine, it is critical to uti-
lize every tool at our disposal to meet 
these challenges. And it extends much 
further than the countries we see in 
the news each day. Currently, 45 mil-
lion people across 43 countries are on 
the brink of famine. Hunger isn’t an 
isolated issue; it affects each and every 
one of us. 
Prior to this assault, Afghanistan 
was facing a dire food shortage, with 23 
million people going hungry. This will 
worsen as Putin’s assault continues. 
In Sudan, 87 percent of the country’s 
wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. 
By the end of this year, an expected 20 
million people will be food insecure, 
one in two Sudanese. 
In Bangladesh, despite progress in re-
cent years, 11 million people are still 
suffering from acute hunger. 
In Ethiopia, 20 million people cur-
rently require food support, and this 
will worsen as Putin’s assault con-
tinues. 
According to the U.N. agency chiefs, 
Yemen is teetering on the edge of an 
outright catastrophe. 
The No. 1 driver of hunger on the 
planet is manmade conflict, according 
to the World Food Programme. As Rus-
sia’s tyranny continues—this Putin- 
made war—countries around the globe 
will teeter on the edge, falling further 
into widespread hunger. 
As the cochair of the Senate Hunger 
Caucus and a member of the Agri-
culture Appropriations Subcommittee, 
which funds Food for Peace and the 
McGovern-Dole Program—what I like 
to call Food for Peace and the Dole- 
McGovern Program—combatting any 
threat of hunger is not only the smart 
thing to do, it is the morally right 
thing to do to save the lives of not only 
those living in Ukraine but around the 
world. 
In January and, again, earlier this 
month, I called on USDA Secretary 
Vilsack 
and 
USAID 
Administrator 
Power to release the resources within 
the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, 
an emergency international food as-
sistance program to combat global 
hunger in times of ‘‘exceptional need.’’ 
The Emerson Trust was created in 1980 
for a moment just like this: when ex-
isting global hunger programs cannot— 
cannot—adequately address the pros-
pects of multiple looming famines. 
As both the immediate and long-term 
effects on Ukraine’s agriculture sector 
become clearer, the United States 
should work—the United States, with 
the rest of the world, should work to 
quickly provide the necessary commod-
ities through sale or donation to meet 
countries’ unsatisfied food and com-
modity needs. Doing so will help allevi-
ate a greater humanitarian crisis than 
has 
already 
been 
caused 
by 
the 
unprovoked invasion and will help fos-
ter political stability in food-insecure 
countries. 
We are seeing the worst of evil— 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine—and the 
tremendous cost—humanitarian cost, 
loss-of-freedom cost—by that invasion. 
We can also see the best in humanity: 
helping a starving world to be fed.

UNIVER-
SITY VIKINGS WOMEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to talk about supply 
chain issues, but before I do, I wanted 
to say a word about March Madness. 
I am pretty sure that most of my col-
leagues who know me think the next 
words out of my mouth are going to be 
something about a small Jesuit school 
in the eastern part of our State, but it 
is not. What I am going to talk about 
is congratulating the Western Wash-
ington University Vikings Women’s 
Basketball 
team 
Division 
II 
final 
championship game players. 
The Vikings will be playing in the 
NCAA Division II Championship after 
defeating North Georgia last night 
with a score of 74 to 68. It was an out-
standing 
performance 
by 
Brooke 
Walling, Emma Duff, and the entire 
team that represents people from all 
over our State—Everson, Tumwater, 
Monroe, 
Vancouver, 
Arlington, 
Marysville, Napavine, Ferndale, and 
various other places. 
I also want to congratulate Head 
Coach Carmen Dolfo, who is in, I think, 
her 31st season leading the Vikings, 
and the fact that this is such a great 
accomplishment for the women of 
Western Washington. 
I hope that we will continue to figure 
out ways to promote women’s basket-
ball 
in 
the 
NCAA 
tournament. 
I 
watched this game last night and saw a 
few people from our State who had 
made it there to cheer on the Vikings, 
but the actual pavilion looked pretty 
empty. Yet I guarantee you it was 
great basketball. 
We need to continue to encourage the 
NCAA to figure out ways to promote 
women’s NCAA March Madness. They 
are great players, they are great 
teams, and they deserve to have the 
same kind of attention. So we look for-
ward to cheering them on in that final 
NCAA tournament Division II game. 
H.R. 4521 
Now, Mr. President, I would like to 
come to the floor and talk about a con-
tinuation of our supply chain chal-
lenges that we are facing in the United 
States of America, particularly around 
the issues facing us in the high cost of 
cars, electronics, and appliances. Actu-
ally, you can say that our chip supply 
chain issues actually impact just about

S1762 
March 24, 2022 
everything because, yesterday, we had 
a hearing with major producers of chip 
semiconductors in the United States 
and also talked with one of the wit-
nesses who happens to be in the freight 
business, because they produce trucks 
that are moving freight throughout the 
United States of America. 
They said the fact that they can’t get 
these new generation trucks out the 
door because of the semiconductor 
shortage means that it is even impact-
ing the cost of freight of every product. 
So I implore my colleagues to come 
to the floor and support sending the 
bill back to the House, telling them 
that we want to go to conference, and 
get into conference as soon as possible. 
Those who want to delay this are just 
delaying the United States in our com-
petition with the world in producing 
and manufacturing great product. If 
you don’t have the best chips, if you 
don’t have the manufacturing, you are 
not going to lead. 
We already know that in 2021, we 
needed 1.2 trillion chips per year. In 
2031, that is going to be 2 trillion chips 
per year. So we know that this short-
age is going to continue far into the fu-
ture unless we act. 
Why is this so important? Obviously, 
there are sectors like energy, transpor-
tation, high-tech, communications, na-
tional security—they all depend on us 
acting. But believe it or not, there are 
companies all throughout the United 
States right now that are looking at 
this issue on supply chain and saying: 
Are we going to make moves to take 
the supply chain back into the United 
States right now? 
I am saying, they are making these 
decisions this month. They are making 
these decisions next month. But there 
are some here who think that we can 
dillydally 
along 
and 
maybe 
take 
months and months and months to rec-
oncile these two bills. They are abso-
lutely wrong. 
I guarantee you, the Europeans are 
not waiting. The Europeans have de-
cided they are going to fund this in-
vestment. They are going to continue 
to move faster than the United States 
of America to decide to do the next 
level of investment in semiconductors. 
So are we just basically saying to 
those U.S. manufacturers and other 
companies that have products: Well, if 
you want the next generation chips, 
maybe you should locate in Europe? 
Do not think this is an idle issue; it 
is not. There is great competition for 
the demand for these semiconductors, 
but some here want to wait months and 
months and months before we get to 
the resolution of this issue. 
We need to send a signal to the mar-
ket that the United States is deter-
mined to be a leader in this area, that 
we are determined for our national se-
curity and manufacturing competitive-
ness, and that we are going to build the 
best chips in the world. And for the 
supply chain, we want that supply 
chain here in the United States of 
America. 
But, again, some of our colleagues 
here would like to wait months and 
months and months to have that de-
bate. We have already waited 286 days 
since the Senate passed, in a bipartisan 
measure, this particular proposal. And 
now, again, people want to hold up this 
process because they don’t quite under-
stand the pain at the pump. 
This is the demand increase that we 
are going to see in semiconductors, as 
I said, by 2030. There is a demand in-
crease of 200 percent. There is a de-
mand increase in the wireless sector, 60 
percent by 2030; consumer electronics, 
80 percent by 2030. What are we waiting 
for? What are we waiting for? 
We know there is demand. We know 
that we can make these chips. We 
know, as one of my colleagues said, if 
something 
happened 
with 
Taiwan, 
where they are making a lot of the 
leading-edge chips, the table is going 
to be turned on the United States. 
What would we do then? It is not like 
a little situation, like we are talking 
about now with shortages and huge 
price increases. What would we do if 
the major supply coming out of Taiwan 
was affected? 
We have to get busy here and work 
on this legislation and start focusing 
on the fact that it is affecting our con-
sumers right now. 
The price increase for our consumers 
is a 41-percent increase in the cost of a 
car, for a used car today. If you think 
about it, we estimated that a used car 
or truck that cost $5,000 a year ago now 
costs $7,000—so a 41-percent increase. 
That is $2,000 that a young family that 
could be going on a vacation or taking 
care of something in the house or 
maybe making a downpayment on a 
home or buying groceries or taking 
care of rent, now, they have an extra 
$2,000 if they just want to get a car to 
get them to and from work. 
That is what we are talking about. 
We are talking about real impacts that 
are happening in real people’s lives 
today, and some here are cavalier 
about these costs. They think this is 
all about how long are they going to 
wait until they give the President of 
the United States another victory, and 
that is a wrong approach. The approach 
should be: What are we going to do to 
deal with the high cost of products 
that we now don’t have because of sup-
ply chain disruptions, and what are we 
going to do to resolve these issues? 
I will debate anybody on either side 
of the aisle who does not want to move 
forward on this bill because they don’t 
like the approach. Maybe they don’t 
like the concept of the United States 
making an investment here. But I will 
tell you, it is very clear that the 
United States has fallen behind. It is 
very clear that we went from 36 per-
cent of the market down to 12. And if 
we do nothing, we are going to fall 
even worse, and we won’t have any of 
the supply chain here. It will be lo-
cated in other places. 
I know the American people get this 
in an intuitive fashion. The informa-
tion age is run by semiconductors that 
increase their capacity to translate 
more, to translate in the automobile 
the voice-activated commands, to do 
the intricacies of communications, as I 
know the Presiding Officer knows, on 
the issues of communication and na-
tional security. We have to depend on 
these for our national security. 
We need to quit wasting our time 
here. These issues are, and my col-
leagues know well—come and make 
your vote. Make your vote, but quit 
holding up a bipartisan discussion by 
both Houses on facing a supply chain 
shortage that is affecting Americans 
every single day. 
If you do nothing, this demand is 
going to continue to increase, and we 
are going to continually be falling be-
hind. 
So I plead with my colleagues: Put 
this aside and vote the way you want 
to vote, but let’s get to conference. 
Let’s show the American people that 
we can collaborate on solving our sup-
ply chain problems, on trying to be se-
rious about sending signals to the 
automotive industry, to the commu-
nications sector, to the national secu-
rity sector. Bring the supply chain 
back, put it here in the United States 
of America, and let’s get busy doing 
what we know how to do best, and that 
is innovate and make America com-
petitive. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 6968 AND 
H.R. 7108 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as I 
have said all week long, there has been 
an imperative for the Senate to unite 
and quickly pass legislation stripping 
Russia of normal trade relation status 
with the United States. The House has 
acted; the White House supports it. 
As the President meets with our al-
lies in Europe, it is very important we 
send a message to the world that we 
are united in making sure Putin pays a 
heavy price for his war on Ukraine. 
After the House passed PNTR last 
week by 424 to 8, including the support 
from Leader MCCARTHY, it is unreason-
able and deadly wrong for the Senate 
not to do the same, especially while 
the President is abroad. So we are 
seeking consent to move this legisla-
tion forward ASAP. 
After a day of long negotiations yes-
terday, I reached an agreement with 
Senator CRAPO, with concurrence from 
Senators WYDEN and MANCHIN, to move 
forward on PNTR while also taking ac-
tion on oil ban legislation separately. 
Now, I understand that Senator PAUL 
has further objection and is demanding 
we amend this agreement with a major 
change to the legislation. Senator 
PAUL appears to be the lone Senator 
demanding this. I believe that all other 
99 Senators are in agreement to pro-
ceed. 
Look, all of us want to see this bill 
move quickly because it is so very 
much needed and it is so bipartisan. I

am willing to include, as part of our 
unanimous consent right now, that 
Senator PAUL be entitled to have his 
amendment 
with 
a 
majority 
vote 
threshold. 
The question before Senator PAUL is, 
even though the vote was 424 to 8 in the 
House and is very bipartisan here in 
the Senate, is he going to tank PNTR 
because his arcane interpretation is 
not forced into the bill? Can Senator 
PAUL take yes for an answer? Can he 
let us move forward today to hold 
Putin accountable? 
Every Senator would like his pro-
posal or her proposal put in the bill, 
but in the Senate, we vote; and we are 
willing to give the Senator a vote, even 
though we greatly disagree with his in-
terpretation of the law that is here. 
I truly, I earnestly, and I strongly 
hope that my Republican colleague 
does not object to bipartisan legisla-
tion that would deal a heavy, heavy 
blow on Putin’s Russia, especially after 
the House of Representatives acted 
with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
Many of our Republican colleagues 
have criticized the Biden administra-
tion for supposedly not acting quickly 
enough on Putin, but now, one Repub-
lican Senator is holding up this over-
whelmingly bipartisan bill. I strongly 
hope some of my other Republican col-
leagues can persuade Senator PAUL to 
accept our agreement here so that we 
can move forward. Let us be equally 
resolute in standing with Ukraine and 
fighting back against Putin’s brutal 
war by passing PNTR in the Senate 
right away. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that at a time to be determined by 
the majority leader, following con-
sultation with the Republican leader, 
the Senate proceed to the en bloc con-
sideration of H.R. 6968, the Russian Oil 
Ban, and H.R. 7108, Russia PNTR, both 
of which are at the desk; that there be 
2 hours for debate on the bills en bloc 
equally divided between the two lead-
ers or designees; that it be in order for 
Senator CRAPO, or a designee, to offer 
the Crapo-Wyden amendment at the 
desk to H.R. 6968; that there be 30 min-
utes for debate equally divided prior to 
the vote on the amendment; that it be 
in order for Senator PAUL to offer the 
amendment at the desk to H.R. 7108; 
that there be 2 hours for debate equally 
divided and controlled in the usual 
form prior to a vote on the Paul 
amendment, and that these be the only 
amendments in order to either bill; 
that upon the use or yielding back of 
time, the bills be considered read a 
third time en bloc and the Senate vote 
on passage of H.R. 7108, as amended, if 
amended, and H.R. 6968, as amended, if 
amended; finally, that the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table without further inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, Mr. President, I think it is incred-
ibly important that we read bills before 
we vote on them, that we have ade-
quate debate, and that we really under-
stand what we are doing. 
The Magnitsky Act was originally an 
act that sought to sanction people in 
Russia—still does—but was expanded 
beyond Russia, and now, this bill would 
expand it further. 
When you are going to sanction peo-
ple, there has to be an argument about 
whom you are going to sanction, so the 
original Magnitsky Act has in law that 
you would sanction people who have 
gross violations of internationally rec-
ognized 
human 
rights. 
Well, 
that 
sounds good, but the Magnitsky Act 
goes a step further and defines what 
these are. Gross violations of human 
rights include torture; cruel, inhu-
mane, or degrading treatment; punish-
ment 
or 
long 
detention 
without 
charges and trial; causing the dis-
appearance of persons by the abduction 
and clandestine detention of those per-
sons—a lot of this applies to, really, 
what happened to Magnitsky; this was 
named after him because of what hap-
pened to him—other flagrant denials of 
the right to life, liberty, and the secu-
rity of the person. 
What we are having happen right now 
is sort of—they are trying to pull a fast 
one, basically. We are going to get rid 
of all definitions of gross human rights, 
and we are going to replace them with 
not a list of things like torture and 
murder, indefinite detention; we are 
going to replace it with the words ‘‘se-
rious human rights abuse.’’ 
Well, it still sounds pretty good, but 
it is like, what does that mean? The 
problem is that many different people 
have different definitions of rights. The 
left, including the U.N., believes you 
have a right to an abortion, to a house, 
to the internet, to healthcare. So you 
can see how, if you have wide-open, 
vague, 
vastly 
ambiguous 
language, 
someone could be President and say: 
The leader of that country is denying 
the human right to abortion, so there-
fore, we must sanction them. Without 
any sort of tribunal, without any sort 
of due process, they would just simply 
sanction them. Or what if they are not 
providing the internet? 
So the thing is, words are important. 
You can’t have vacuous sort of defini-
tions. Where did this definition—it 
came from the Trump administration. 
So basically, what they are trying to 
do is mirror the Trump administration, 
which gave unlimited authority to the 
President. It is kind of surprising, for 
all the superficial rhetoric and opposi-
tion to President Trump, that they are 
trying to adopt his language now. But 
this language also comes from the 
Biden administration because the one 
thing Presidents have in common is 
they like unlimited power without 
checks and balances. 
If this language goes through, it will 
remove any checks and balances or any 
definitions as to what human rights 
abuses are. It is a terrible mistake. It 
is rash, and we shouldn’t do it. 
I have offered an amendment, and I 
will offer it here in a moment. My 
amendment simply includes the defini-
tion that I just read. Gross violation of 
human rights—torture, cruel and inhu-
mane treatment, indefinite detention. 
That is what we would put in the bill, 
is the actual definition. These aren’t 
my words; these are the words of the 
mostly Democrats who wrote the bill, 
the Magnitsky Act. 
What they are trying to do is take 
the Magnitsky Act and drive an enor-
mous hole in it that you can push any-
thing through and do sanctions on any-
body, anywhere in the world, based on 
a vague, ambiguous, and vast defini-
tion that is not specific. 
All I am asking is that you keep the 
Magnitsky Act. The irony here is the 
very authors of the Magnitsky Act are 
on the floor saying: We don’t want the 
Magnitsky Act anymore. We want a 
big, enormous hole, that the President 
can sanction anybody in the world any-
time. 
It is a terrible idea. It is ripe for 
abuse from a President. 
Many on the other side had argu-
ments with the previous President, and 
they worried about him having unlim-
ited power. So they want to give un-
limited power to their President be-
cause they like him better. Well, guess 
what? I am an equal opportunity, ecu-
menical kind of guy who says: No 
President should have vast powers. All 
Presidents’ 
powers 
should 
be 
cir-
cumspect. 
All 
Presidents’ 
powers 
should be controlled. 
All I am asking for is that we pass 
the original Magnitsky Act. So this is 
going to be forever. This isn’t a year or 
2. When we first started into the 
Magnitsky Act, we were going to do it 
for just a year or 2 and see how it is 
going. This is forever. It will never 
come back up again. And we are doing 
it with 5 minutes’ worth of debate, not 
going through a committee, and we are 
just simply going to say: Do whatever 
you want. Sanction anybody in the en-
tire world. 
It is a huge mistake, it is a huge ex-
pansion of government power, of Presi-
dential power, and it will lead to abuse. 
And I promise you, the moment there 
is a Republican President back in the 
White House, the other side will be 
squawking, saying: Why is he doing 
this? Why is he doing this? 
So I would say take a step back. We 
could talk about this over the next sev-
eral days. We could come to an agree-
ment. I have even said we could expand 
the definition. The definition of ‘‘gross 
violation 
of 
human 
rights’’ 
from 
Magnitsky should not be thrown away. 
And we could add to it. If there are 
other things, such as corruption, that 
you don’t think are included, give us 
some words, and we will talk about it 
and see if we can come to a com-
promise. That is what was offered, and 
what we get back is that, oh, every-
body else agrees on the other side, so I 
should be quiet. I am talking about 
something that is arcane. This is your

March 24, 2022 
language. This is the Magnitsky Act 
from the last 5 years, and you are call-
ing it arcane? 
This is a very reasonable request. It 
is a very unreasonable request to ram 
this down the throats of Americans, to 
expand Presidential power with no 
checks and balances, and I absolutely 
object to it. 
I will offer as a counter, though, a 
unanimous consent request that is at 
the desk to have my amendment pass 
immediately, and if my amendment is 
passed immediately, that the remain-
ing request from Senator SCHUMER be 
passed as well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Before I yield to my 
friend from the State of Maryland, the 
author of the Magnitsky Act, let me 
just say this to my good friend from 
Kentucky: Every Senator would like 
their amendment to be easily inserted 
into a bill, but in the Senate, we vote. 
I am offering the Senator a vote on his 
amendment. If each Senator said ‘‘my 
way or the highway,’’ we would have 
total paralysis even on an important 
piece of legislation like this. 
I yield to the Senator from Mary-
land. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. I reserve the right to 
object in regard to the Senator from 
Kentucky’s request. 
Mr. President, first, let me just cor-
rect some of the statements that were 
made. This bill went through the com-
mittee. It was voted on in the com-
mittee. Amendments were offered in 
the committee. The Senator from Ken-
tucky was present during the markup 
in the committee. That is the way leg-
islation should be considered in this 
body. 
We are talking about how the Senate 
can work the way it should? Let the 
committees function. And that is ex-
actly what we did in regard to the leg-
islation that is on the floor. It went 
through the regular process. And the 
Senator’s request is despite the fact 
that the majority leader has said he 
will allow a vote on the floor and let 
the Members of the Senate make the 
decision as to whether they agree or 
disagree with the arguments made by 
the author of the amendment. That is 
how a democracy should work. That is 
how the legislative process should 
work. 
So I am somewhat shocked that the 
Senator would object to the majority 
leader’s request that would allow the 
legislation to come to the floor and let 
the Senate work its will by majority 
vote. That is what the majority leader 
said. 
Let me give you a little bit more his-
tory on this. The original Magnitsky 
bill was originally attached to the 
PNTR for Russia, and it was aimed 
solely at the tragic death of Sergei 
Magnitsky. We wanted to hold those 
responsible for his death accountable. 
That is why the language the Senator 
is referring to was included in the 
original act. It was aimed at one epi-
sode and one set of abusers. 
It became such a successful tool for 
diplomacy that, working with Senator 
McCain, the two of us worked on mak-
ing it a global bill so that it would 
apply beyond just Russia and that we 
could use this to advance American 
foreign policy. 
And we worked—and quite frankly, 
we didn’t have the enthusiastic support 
of the administration because the Sen-
ator from Kentucky is right: Adminis-
trations like to have their own author-
ity; they don’t like Congress to inter-
cede. And on the Magnitsky, we can 
make recommendations as to who 
should be considered for sanctions. So 
it was a major step forward, and we 
were able to pass Global Magnitsky. 
In the meantime, President Trump 
worked with us on this. He was a sup-
porter of using this tool. And he passed 
an Executive order—signed an Execu-
tive order, that included provisions 
that we asked him to include in the Ex-
ecutive order because we recognized 
that corruption was the fuel for Mr. 
Putin and Russia and authoritarian re-
gimes. So we wanted to make sure that 
we could include corruption. We want-
ed to make sure that we could include 
the enablers—those who enabled these 
human rights abusers to do what they 
do, and that was included in the Execu-
tive order. 
And we worked with the Trump ad-
ministration. And we have worked with 
the Biden administration. And we now 
have a workable standard. And better 
than that, as a result of our leadership, 
we have gotten our countries around 
the world to conform to our tool. The 
European Union has passed Global 
Magnitsky. The UK has passed Global 
Magnitsky. Canada has passed Global 
Magnitsky. Japan is considering it as 
we speak. 
It is becoming the standard. So from 
a process point of view, what was 
passed out of our committee, what was 
passed out of the House committee, 
both 
authorizing 
committees 
have 
agreed on this language, which has 
been signed off by Treasury so they 
know they can use it, which has due 
process in it because we are dealing 
with property rights. 
So now let’s get to the substance of 
what 
the 
gentleman’s 
amendment 
would do. The substance of it is that it 
would not allow us to do what we need 
to do in regards to Mr. Putin and Rus-
sia as a result of his invasion of 
Ukraine. And the sponsor of this 
amendment is very clear what he is 
trying to do. He is trying to take back 
the current authority under the Execu-
tive order and would, therefore, not 
even be useful at all in regards to going 
after Mr. Putin. 
We would be taking a step back. It 
was just a few days ago that President 
Zelenskyy asked us to expand the indi-
vidual sanctions, and that is what is on 
the floor right now in the majority 
leader’s request, so we can expand it, 
we can give him the tools he needs, so 
that we can respond and help the peo-
ple of Ukraine. That is what is involved 
here. 
But with the amendment being of-
fered by the gentleman from Kentucky, 
we would be moving backwards. We 
would be doing just the opposite. It 
would weaken where we are today. So I 
am really puzzled as to why we can’t 
trust the judgment of the Members of 
the Senate to make this decision. Let’s 
argue over the 2 hours that the major-
ity leader will give us to argue this 
point. I look forward to that argument 
on the floor of the Senate. I already 
had that argument in our committee. 
Because the two—the gentleman from 
Kentucky and I, along with the Pre-
siding Officer, served on the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. We had 
this argument in committee. And if I 
am correct, I believe, the vote was all 
but one supporting my position. 
So we have already had this debate 
where it should take place among the 
experts. And the gentleman’s not satis-
fied with that. I am at a loss here be-
cause I know how important it is for us 
to move forward to help the people of 
Ukraine. 
Every day, we see the bodies on the 
ground. We see the horrific action by 
Mr. Putin, and we really want to do ev-
erything we can to help the people of 
Ukraine. The action the majority lead-
er is asking us to take will help the 
people of Ukraine. And as I understand 
it, one Senator is going to deny us the 
opportunity to take a very positive 
step, to stand up for democracy, and 
for standing up for the people of 
Ukraine. 
I object to the request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard to the modification. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon is recog-
nized. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am 
going to keep my remarks short and 
simple. America and the world need 
immediately 
the 
toughest 
possible 
sanctions 
against 
the 
Russian 
oligarchs, who are working constantly 
to devise Byzantine schemes to get 
around the kind of sanctions that are 
in this trade bill. 
We all understand what is at issue 
here, and that is that we need to move 
quickly. We need to move while the 
President is mobilizing the collective 
strength of our allies. 
And I am interested in working with 
all of my colleagues. With the majority 
leader’s leadership, we have been work-
ing for days on this. But what is impor-
tant—and our friend from Maryland 
has touched on it—is that we not just 
relitigate what came up in one com-
mittee or another, if it is going to hold 
up the essential task ahead, and that is 
that these oligarchs who are Putin’s

best allies and are working with him 
constantly to figure out ways to get 
money to fuel the Putin war machine— 
what they really don’t want is what 
the sanctions will do: rein them in and 
limit them as they continually try to 
devise these schemes. 
So I would just urge my colleagues— 
and we are here to continue to work on 
this—to get this done and get it done 
now because to do otherwise allows the 
oligarchs and all their lawyers and fi-
nancial managers to look at what is 
happening in the U.S. Senate. And 
those oligarchs say, ‘‘Doesn’t look like 
there is going to be anything right 
now—don’t 
have 
to 
worry 
imme-
diately.’’ 
The Senate is better than this. I urge 
my colleagues to pass this bill, which 
would impose the harshest economic 
consequences of a generation on the 
Russians, 
and 
particularly 
the 
oligarchs, who have done so much to 
prop Putin up against the odds. 
Pass this bill. Pass it now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today’s 
powerful new sanctions against hun-
dreds of Putin allies are another crit-
ical step in U.S. leadership, bringing 
our allies together to ratchet up pres-
sure on Russia to halt its brutal inva-
sion of Ukraine. 
I think Putin has been shocked by a 
couple things. Putin has been shocked 
that the Ukrainians have had such fu-
rious, effective, courageous resistance. 
He didn’t see that coming. 
The other thing that shocked Putin 
has been the skill with which President 
Biden assembled this coalition of coun-
tries to stand up to Putin, to provide 
assistance to refugees and assistance to 
Ukrainians in their country, to provide 
military assistance, and to put the 
squeeze on sanctions against Russia. 
He has assembled this coalition skill-
fully, including countries like Ger-
many and Sweden and Finland and 
Switzerland, 
even—countries 
that 
never really played here and nobody 
really expected. And Biden has brought 
them in, in a coalition, and extracted— 
and with the right kind of target on 
sanctions. 
In addition to sanctioning the banks 
and the oil companies, in addition to 
sanctioning the oligarchs and Putin 
himself, the President is announcing 
now sanctioning Russian parliamentar-
ians and the Parliament itself, the 
Russian Duma, a dozen more Russian 
arms merchants and defense firms that 
have enabled this war, and additional 
Putin cronies, including the CEO of 
Russia’s largest bank. 
I don’t understand opposition to what 
we are trying to do. I don’t know. Do 
we have Members of this Senate, per-
haps, that, for whatever reason, side 
with Putin or side with the oligarchs? 
I don’t know. But this is legislation we 
ought to be able to get moving quickly 
through this body as it did in the 
House. 
As long as Putin’s invasion goes on, 
we will continue to lead the world, 
turning up the heat and weakening 
Russia’s war machine. 
Today, I come to the floor to support 
the removal of permanent normal trade 
relations with Russia. It is not, as the 
Presiding 
Officer 
from 
Maryland 
knows—it is not the first time a num-
ber of us have been concerned about 
our government’s mistakes, in large 
part, because of corporate lobbying on 
permanent normal trade relations with 
countries around the world. 
One of worst decisions ever made in 
this body, or at least in recent history, 
and the damage it did to manufac-
turing in the industrial Midwest and 
elsewhere, was giving permanent nor-
mal trade relations to China and the 
advantages that gave them. 
American companies, always in pur-
suit of cheaper labor, if going south 
wasn’t good enough—they would go to 
Mexico and then they would go to 
China, close the plants in Ohio or West-
ern Maryland, move to China, open up 
plants there with cheap labor and with 
pretty 
much 
nonexistent 
environ-
mental regulations, and then ship 
those jobs back to the United States. 
That was permanent normal trade rela-
tions with China that we gave them 
some 20 years ago. It was a horrible 
mistake, but, today, this is about—for 
a different reason—permanent normal 
trade relations with Russia that we 
have granted. 
The President has already committed 
to ending permanent normal trade re-
lations with Russia, and the House has 
already passed a bill ending PNTR with 
Russia, so what are Senate Republicans 
waiting for? 
Russia should not have free and un-
limited access to America’s economy 
or to the global economy. There should 
be no place for Putin and his cronies to 
hide. 
We are trying to get this done in the 
Senate. I was on the floor yesterday 
hoping we could see this done then. 
Twenty-four hours more have passed; 
24 hours more of Putin attacking, as a 
war criminal, people in Ukraine, people 
who are innocent, people who should 
never have to deal with this; another 
night in Ukraine under fire from an 
unprovoked Russian advance on civil-
ian families; another day of destruc-
tion of civilian buildings in peaceful 
cities. 
So waiting every day hurts the 
Ukrainian people. We need to do our 
part to give the President immediate 
legal authority he needs to work with 
our allies on this to shut off access to 
favorable tariff treatment for Russia’s 
goods here and around the world. 
Senator PAUL, one Republican Sen-
ator, needs to relent to let us pass this. 
I mean, I know what LIZ CHENEY, a 
Member of the House, the daughter of 
Vice President Cheney under President 
Bush—I know what she said some time 
ago, and she is a Republican. She 
talked about the Putin wing of the Re-
publican Party. 
I have no idea who in this body is in 
the Putin wing of the Republican 
Party, but I do know that there is re-
sistance on the other side of the aisle 
to doing what we need to do to give 
President Biden even more tools to do 
even more than he has already done in 
this. 
The bill passed the House with a 
nearly unanimous vote. We need to fi-
nalize it in the Senate so we can ratch-
et up the pressure further, cut off Rus-
sia’s ability to finance its unprovoked 
invasion of another member country in 
the World Trade Organization. 
Even before this war, we knew that 
Russia, like China, games the rules. 
They cheat on trade. I said it yesterday 
on the floor: They subsidize their in-
dustries. They pollute the environment 
to gain that unfair advantage. It is 
cheaper to make something if you 
don’t dispose of waste or you put con-
taminants into the air instead of dis-
posing of them in another way. 
Ohioans know all too well about 
being forced to compete with countries 
that cheat. 
Why have we let another day go by 
with this still on the books? If we don’t 
remove it now, Russia will continue to 
use the status to position their indus-
tries in the global market, hurting 
American companies in the process. 
It is not a partisan issue. A couple 
weeks ago—almost a month ago—I in-
troduced the bicameral, bipartisan bill 
with Senator CASSIDY of Louisiana to 
remove Russia’s permanent normal 
trade relations status. There is bipar-
tisan support to do this quickly. 
I have worked with my colleague 
Senator CRAPO on many Russia sanc-
tions efforts over the years. I trust 
him. I know we share the same goals, 
but it is Senator PAUL, speaking for 
whomever on this, not letting this bill 
through. 
I am hopeful there is a path forward. 
I hope we can work out differences 
quickly. 
The 
majority—an 
over-
whelming majority of this body wants 
to move. We all—we should all stand 
together saying countries that invade a 
sovereign nation will not have free and 
unrestricted access to our economy, pe-
riod. 
Again, countries that invade another 
sovereign nation will not—should not— 
have free and unrestricted access to 
our economy. It is time to come to-
gether to end permanent normal trade 
relations with Russia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts is recognized. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, Vladi-
mir Putin has continued to wage hor-
rific war against Ukraine and the 
Ukrainian people. This invasion, waged 
upon the profits of Russia’s oil and gas 
empire, has caused destruction and 
devastation beyond measure. 
We must denounce Putin’s war of 
choice, and we must call out profit-
eering and the ricochet effects of that 
conflict that affect Americans and oth-
ers across the world. 
This connection to conflict is only 
possible as a result of the fallacy of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1766 
March 24, 2022 
American energy independence from 
oil and gas extraction—a lie that has 
been sold by the American Petroleum 
Institute or the ‘‘American Prevari-
cation Institute,’’ as they should be 
called. For years, the oil and gas indus-
try has sold Americans more snake oil 
than actual oil, promising security and 
safety in exchange for unlimited drill-
ing, unlimited exports, unlimited prof-
its for Big Oil and Big Gas in the 
United States. And after yet another 
year of price spikes caused by Putin 
and profiteering, it is time to say 
enough is enough with these false 
promises and crocodile tears from the 
American Petroleum Institute, from 
ExxonMobil, from Chevron, from all of 
these companies. 
President Biden was right to follow 
my SPIGOT Act and the bipartisan 
consensus in the House and Senate to 
ban all oil imports from Russia. The 
only way to end Putin’s oil- and gas- 
funded wars is to cut off his oil- and 
gas-funded piggy bank, which comes, 
unfortunately, 
historically, 
from 
American consumers at the pump buy-
ing Russian oil for their cars. That has 
to end. And, thankfully, President 
Biden has now made that decision. 
And it is because we have a moral 
moment here to provide all possible 
humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian 
people. We have a moral moment here 
to cut off the money pipeline that is 
funding the missiles and the tanks that 
are destroying the homes of innocent 
people in Ukraine. And we have a 
moral moment that ensures that we 
take the action to build a better world 
that is safe from the climate-change- 
fueled crisis. But our ability to meet 
this moral moment hinges on what we 
do next on the floor of the U.S. Senate, 
what action we take to respond to this 
obvious crisis that we have on the 
planet, all related to this oil- and gas- 
fueled military invasion of Ukraine— 
the tanks, the planes, the soldiers—all 
paid for by oil and gas money. 
We could fail to meet this moral mo-
ment by accepting the bad faith argu-
ments from Big Oil, which is using this 
horrifying invasion to push for more 
drilling and money to fossil fuel com-
panies with more lands and waters lost 
to extraction, more profit for Big Oil at 
the expense of American pocketbooks; 
or we can meet the moral moment that 
the United States is willing to lead 
with innovation, moving away from 
global oil chaos and closer to clean, 
cheap, 
domestic 
renewable 
energy 
sources—sources that will not fall vic-
tim to price hikes from despots, dic-
tators, and criminals overseas. 
Now, we have all heard the Big Lie 
from Big Oil, FOX News, and the GOP, 
the Gas and Oil Party. Their message 
is: All you need to do is give us a few 
more leases, cut a few more regula-
tions, provide us with a few more sub-
sidies, and then we will be on our way 
to energy independence. 
Trust the oil and gas companies, they 
say, and FOX News says, ‘‘Yes, trust 
the oil and gas industry,’’ but that ar-
gument is leakier than an old oil tank-
er, and it has been proven again and 
again. 
If Big Oil wanted to make us energy 
independent, they would have already 
done it. Instead, they resort to their 
Big Lie. 
So here are the facts: 
Big Oil is sitting on 11,000 unused oil 
and gas leases, and 9,000 of those leases 
are on Federal lands in the United 
States. They have already been pur-
chased by the oil and gas industry, 
mostly for $2 an acre, but they have 
got them; and 2,000 leases are offshore, 
in the waters of the United States, and 
they have all been already approved for 
drilling. 
Big Oil also has 6,000 partially drilled 
wells that they can use to drill right 
now. In other words, they have already 
done the drilling, and they are still not 
going there right now, on an emer-
gency basis, to produce that additional 
oil and gas. 
Why is that? 
Because rather than using the re-
sources they already have to drill, they 
are using this crisis as an excuse to get 
more leases, more wells, more profit 
for themselves while sitting on, squat-
ting on, the existing leases they al-
ready have that could produce the ad-
ditional oil and gas that they say they 
want to produce. Of course, they don’t 
want to produce that oil or else they 
would be doing it already. They just 
want more leases that they can sit on 
and profit from in the years ahead. 
In terms of solving this crisis that we 
have right now, they can do it if they 
want, but they don’t want to because it 
might actually drive down the price of 
oil or it might drive down the price of 
natural gas if they produce more here. 
So this is not a problem of govern-
mental overreach. If you don’t trust 
me on this, how about trusting the oil 
executives themselves. In a recent sur-
vey, 60 percent of oil executives said 
that investors are keeping them from 
drilling. Just 10 percent pointed to reg-
ulations. These are the oil company ex-
ecutives. They say it is the investors— 
the millionaires in their companies— 
who don’t want to drill, not Federal 
regulations. 
Remember the Keystone Pipeline— 
the 
pipeline 
that 
the 
Republicans 
wanted so they could be energy inde-
pendent? 
In 2015, every single Republican on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate voted 
against my amendments to ban the ex-
ports of that oil from the Keystone 
Pipeline. They kept saying then it 
would lead to energy independence, and 
when I said, ‘‘Fine. Let’s have an 
amendment that says it cannot be ex-
ported,’’ every single Republican voted 
no—allow it to be exported out of our 
country. 
These crocodile tears from the Re-
publican Party—from the GOP, Gas 
and Oil Party—are just so predictable, 
and it comes back every single time. 
Big Oil has kept up their export she-
nanigans. In 2021, we exported 8.6 mil-
lion barrels of oil a day while import-
ing 8.4 million barrels per day. Last 
year, we imported, on average, 600,000 
barrels of oil a day from Russia. At the 
same time, we exported the same 
amount to China. That is what the Re-
publican Party and the gas and oil in-
dustry got in 2015 when we lifted the 
ban on the export of American oil. 
That is not energy independence; it is 
profit dependence of the American peo-
ple on the agenda of Big Oil and Big 
Gas. 
The Gas and Oil Party doesn’t want 
to drill for oil here in America to pro-
tect Americans from economic harm; 
they want to do it for their own eco-
nomic benefit. Big Oil has a need for 
greed. The Republican Party, as we 
just heard in the confirmation hearing, 
kept 
talking 
about 
crime 
in 
the 
streets. No. The big problem is crime in 
the suites—crime in the oil and gas ex-
ecutive suites of our country—and the 
Republican Party’s inability to stand 
up to them so that we have true energy 
independence in our country. In 2021, 
while 
consumers 
sacrificed 
at 
the 
pump, with gas prices increasing by 50 
percent, Big Oil made over—get this 
number—$200 billion in profits. 
That is what is happening. That is 
why they don’t want to drill—because 
the price of oil might come down; 
therefore, their profits might come 
down, but they have built all the leases 
they need right now. This isn’t about 
energy supply for consumers; it is 
about Big Oil’s demand for profits for 
their shareholders and for their execu-
tives. That is what the agenda of the 
oil and gas industry in America is all 
about, not American security, not 
American consumers, not American en-
vironmental and healthcare issues, but 
the profits of their executives. 
We don’t need sacrifice in our coun-
try. We need innovation. We need a 
way to ensure that we unleash all of 
the potential, which we have, in our 
country in order to tap into all of our 
rich natural resources. Instead of sup-
porting energy independence and get-
ting out of the way of a real domestic, 
clean energy boom, Big Oil would rath-
er force consumers to sacrifice with 
high prices at the gas pump. 
We don’t need Americans to sacrifice 
by paying high gas prices. Instead, we 
need to innovate and install clean en-
ergy solutions. This is our short-term 
and our long-term solution to price dis-
ruptions, climate chaos, environmental 
injustice, and wars paid for with oil 
and gas profits—much of it war profit-
eering. 
Here are some more facts: 
An additional 16 million electric ve-
hicles on the road would replace all of 
the oil that we currently import from 
Russia. Let me say that again. If we 
would just deploy 16 million all-elec-
tric vehicles, we would back out all the 
oil from Russia. The next 16 million 
all-electric vehicles would back out all 
the Saudi oil that we import into the 
United States. ‘‘EVs’’ just doesn’t 
stand for ‘‘electric vehicles’’; it also

March 24, 2022 
stands for ‘‘ending violence’’—getting 
the United States tied up into situa-
tions around the world because of all of 
the money that these wealthy oil 
states get from the United States. 
Here is another way to break it down: 
We can put 5 million electric vehicles 
on the road, 5 million heat pumps in 
homes, and replace 75 percent of our 
public bus fleet with electric buses and 
still back out all the oil we import 
from Russia. In the time it would take 
to implement these measures, we can 
release the already congressionally 
mandated sales of the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to give consumers relief 
at the gas pump. 
We can accomplish all of this by 
passing my SAVE Consumers Act with 
Senator HEINRICH, which would grant 
the President additional authority to 
implement energy efficiency standards 
and release another 265 million barrels 
of oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve by the end of 2023. 
We can do this. We can deploy the 
Strategic Petroleum right now, invest 
in a renewable, clean energy agenda, 
and actually produce enough energy 
that substitutes for all the Russian oil 
and do so in a very brief period of time; 
but we have to commit to destroying 
the demand by Putin’s dirty energy 
business model by powering our own 
country with clean, American-made re-
newable energy. We can power our way 
to peace. We can power our way to 
stopping the most dangerous effects of 
greenhouse gases that are creating cli-
mate change on our planet. 
Putin banks on divisions in the West. 
What he found instead was our com-
plete solidarity with the people of 
Ukraine. Imagine if we were to channel 
that same spirit of unity to unlock a 
safe, healthy future and untether our-
selves from Putin’s dirty profits. We 
should agree that no country continues 
to have a veto on our energy security 
or of our friends and allies. 
The future lies not in the extracted 
fossil fuels of the Industrial Revolution 
but in technologies that will power the 
clean energy revolution. 
It is in our interest to build a well- 
trained, well-paid battalion of Amer-
ican union workers to lead countries to 
look to their energy needs from the 
red, white, and blue of the United 
States instead of Putin’s cronies who 
finance Russia’s repression at home 
and adventurism abroad. 
By passing a $555-billion investment 
in clean energy and climate justice, we 
can build a made-in-America clean 
economy that delivers real energy 
independence for our country, and we 
can export those technologies around 
the world. With tax credits and rebates 
in wind and solar, all-electric vehicles, 
offshore wind, battery storage tech-
nologies, heat pumps, and advanced do-
mestic manufacturing, we can cut 
costs at home while cutting off Putin’s 
money line from oil and natural gas. 
These investments would reduce our 
dependence on global oil markets and, 
instead, power our country through lo-
calized clean energy. 
The solar from our deserts, the solar 
power from those States that have near 
year-round Sun, the wind off of our 
coast from Massachusetts down to 
Maryland, which the Presiding Officer 
represents, the wind off of the west 
coast, the hydropower from our South-
east, the geothermal from our North-
west—all of it can be tapped, and we 
can end an era wherein our country is 
held hostage by the need to import 
more oil. 
Our Federal climate policies are ex-
actly what we need—this national se-
curity moment, this environmental 
moment, this healthcare moment, this 
moral moment for our country and for 
the planet. There is no quick solution 
to this quagmire that Big Oil has 
drilled the United States into. There 
are only better and worse solutions, 
moral and immoral solutions. We can 
innovate and install clean energy that 
produces all of the energy which we 
need and that protects us, protects our 
allies, and protects our planet at the 
very same time or we can continue 
down the pathway of false promises 
and profiteering. 
It is our moral moment. Let’s stand 
in solidarity with those affected by oil 
and gas wars and seize this chance for 
a cleaner, safer, more affordable future 
for Americans, for our allies, and for 
the world. 
There are doubters that we can make 
this transition, people who say: Well, 
wind and solar and all-electric vehicles 
and battery and storage technology— 
that sounds fine, but it just won’t solve 
the problem. They are the same people 
who said that we could not deploy the 
spectrum. 
I was the author of the bill that ac-
complished and that made it possible 
for everyone, by 1995, to have a flip 
phone in their pockets at 10 cents a 
minute. Then, in using that very same 
spectrum 10 years later, a young guy, 
Steve Jobs, invented a phone which is 
a computer that has the same power as 
the computers on the Apollo mission to 
the Moon. We innovated; we moved; 
and we can actually see the people, in 
their 
fleeing 
Ukraine, 
all 
holding 
smartphones invented in the United 
States because we put together the 
policies that changed us from black ro-
tary dial phones to these powerful com-
puters in everyone’s pockets. 
We can do the same thing with en-
ergy. We can create a revolution. We 
just have to get Big Oil and Big Gas 
out of the way and allow our young 
people to innovate, allow our entre-
preneurs to innovate, allow for the de-
ployment of all of these technologies, 
and then children will have to look to 
the history books to find if there ever 
was such a crisis that we are living 
through today. 
So my hope is that the Senate will 
respond and that they will understand 
how much of this conflict is created by 
the globe’s dependence upon oil and 
gas. Putin is proving that to us once 
again, and if we look at the Middle 
East, we can see that hole that we have 
dug for ourselves and our dependence 
upon that region. 
We have the solution. It is innova-
tion; it is optimism; it is unleashing 
the entrepreneurial spirit in our coun-
try. That will be the challenge of the 
U.S. Senate over the next 2 months. 
Will we have the same courage to re-
spond, to take on those energy titans, 
in the same way that the Ukrainian 
people, every day, are giving us the ex-
ample that we should be following? 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—H.R. 4521 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing rule XXII, the cloture mo-
tions on amendment No. 5002 and H.R. 
4521 ripen at 5:30 p.m., Monday, March 
28; that if cloture is invoked on the 
substitute, all postcloture time be con-
sidered expired; the remaining pending 
amendments be withdrawn; no further 
amendments be in order; the substitute 
amendment be agreed to; the cloture 
motion on the bill be withdrawn; the 
bill, H.R. 4521, be considered read a 
third time, and the Senate vote on pas-
sage of the bill, as amended, with 60 af-
firmative votes required for passage, 
all without further intervening action 
or debate. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there objection? 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator is recognized. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am 
requesting votes on two very impor-
tant issues regarding this competition 
bill: No. 1 to put the Senate on record 
in opposition to providing $53 billion in 
corporate welfare to the highly profit-
able microchip industry, with no pro-
tections for the American taxpayer; 
and two, to eliminate the $10 million 
bailout included in this bill for Blue 
Origin, a space company owned by Jeff 
Bezos, the second wealthiest person in 
this country who is now worth over 
$180 billion. 
So, Mr. President, I ask the majority 
leader: Will you now give me your com-
mitment to receive two rollcall votes 
next week on each of these motions to 
instruct at a simple majority thresh-
old? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes, I 
give the Senator from Vermont my 
firm commitment to do whatever I can 
to get an agreement to have votes on 
his two motions to instruct when the 
message comes back from the House on 
this measure.

March 24, 2022 
Having made that commitment, I ask 
the Senator from Vermont whether he 
might allow the Senate to agree to my 
original unanimous consent request? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate the commitment of the major-
ity leader to ensure that I will receive 
rollcall votes on these two issues. Hav-
ing received the majority leader’s firm 
commitment, I will not object. 
I ask unanimous consent to address 
the body for 10 minutes. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there an objection to the original re-
quest? 
Hearing none, it is so ordered. 
Without objection, the Senator from 
Vermont is recognized for up to 10 min-
utes. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me 
thank the majority leader for his will-
ingness to put my two motions to in-
struct on the floor next week for a 
vote. And I want to take a minute to 
explain to my colleagues and the 
American people what these amend-
ments are about. 
As I think most Americans under-
stand, half of the people in our country 
are living paycheck to paycheck. They 
cannot 
afford 
the 
high 
cost 
of 
healthcare. They are often spending 
more than they can afford for housing. 
If they are fortunate enough to be able 
to have gotten a higher education, it is 
more likely than not that they are 
struggling 
with 
significant 
student 
debt. If they are young parents, they 
are probably finding it hard to locate 
quality, affordable childcare or pre-K. 
If they are older Americans, it is likely 
they are having a hard time paying for 
the dental care, the hearing aids, the 
eyeglasses, or the home healthcare 
that they desperately need. 
Meanwhile, as many middle-class and 
working-class Americans fall further 
and further behind, there is another 
economic reality taking place in our 
country. 
We 
don’t 
talk 
about 
it 
enough—but we should—and that is 
that the people on top, the very 
wealthiest people in our country, are 
doing phenomenally well and, in fact, 
have never had it so good. 
Today in America, we have more in-
come and wealth inequality than ever 
before. We talk a lot about Russian oli-
garchy—and that is certainly true—but 
anybody who thinks that we don’t have 
an oligarchy in this country is surely 
mistaken. 
In our country today, we have two 
people who own more wealth than the 
bottom 40 percent of the American pop-
ulation, and the top 1 percent own 
more wealth than the bottom 92 per-
cent. 
And, unbelievably, during this ter-
rible pandemic—which has cost us al-
most 1 million lives—when thousands 
of essential workers died, they died be-
cause they had to go to their jobs, and 
going to their jobs, they contracted the 
virus. During that same period of time, 
the billionaire class became much, 
much wealthier. In fact, over 700 bil-
lionaires in America became nearly $2 
trillion richer during the pandemic. In 
other words, for the people on top, the 
pandemic has been a very, very good 
time economically. 
But it is not just the increased 
wealth of the very rich that we are see-
ing. Corporate profits are at an alltime 
high, and CEOs have seen huge in-
creases in their compensation pack-
ages. And a lot of this is happening be-
cause of the unprecedented level of cor-
porate greed—corporate greed that we 
are seeing. 
Let me just give you a few examples 
of the corporate greed that is taking 
place right now. Everybody knows that 
the price of gas is soaring. Last I saw, 
it is averaging about $4.25 a gallon. 
Meanwhile, ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, 
and Shell made nearly $30 billion in 
profit last quarter alone. The price of 
gas is soaring and major oil companies 
are making huge, huge profits. Amazon 
recently raised the price of its Prime 
membership by 16.8 percent. Mean-
while, it increased its profits by 75 per-
cent to a record-breaking $35 billion. 
In terms of food, everybody knows 
food prices are going up. The price of 
beef is up 32 percent, price of chicken is 
up 20 percent, price of pork is up 13 per-
cent. Meanwhile, Tyson Foods, a major 
producer of chicken, beef, and hot dogs, 
increased its profits by 140 percent last 
quarter to $1.1 billion. The price of food 
is soaring, and food companies are en-
joying huge profits. 
While Americans are finding it hard-
er and harder to pay for the outrageous 
costs of prescription drugs—we pay the 
highest prices in the world for our med-
icine—last year Pfizer, Johnson & 
Johnson, and AbbVie, three major 
pharmaceutical 
companies—increased 
their profits by over 90 percent to $54 
billion. People can’t afford the price of 
prescription drugs, but pharmaceutical 
industry profits are soaring. Again, all 
of which kind of takes me to the legis-
lation that is on the floor right now, 
the so-called Competitiveness Act. 
Do we need to increase computer chip 
production in the United States? Yes, 
we do. But we need to do it in a way 
that does not provide massive amounts 
of corporate welfare to an already 
enormously profitable industry. 
In my view, it makes zero sense to 
provide $53 billion in corporate welfare. 
That is a blank check: Here it is, 
microchip industry, no strings at-
tached, no protections for the Amer-
ican taxpayer to the microchip indus-
try. 
And as part of this legislation, in ad-
dition—I don’t know how many people 
know this—some may think I am actu-
ally kidding when I say this—but this 
legislation provides $10 billion in bail-
out to Jeff Bezos—the second wealthi-
est person in America who is worth 
over $180 billion—so that his company, 
Blue Origin, can launch a rocket ship 
to the Moon. 
A word about the microchip industry. 
We are talking about an industry that 
has shut down over 780 manufacturing 
plants in the United States and elimi-
nated 150,000 American jobs over the 
last 20 years, while moving most of its 
production overseas. Got that? So this 
is an industry that said: Hey, we are 
making money, but we can make even 
more money by going to low-wage 
countries. Let’s do that. Let’s throw 
150,000 American workers out on the 
street. We are going to go abroad. 
Now, in terms of this $53 billion bail-
out, nobody knows exactly who will be 
receiving that money. My guess is that 
the bulk of that money will go to five 
major semiconductor companies, and 
that is Intel, Texas Instruments, Mi-
cron Technology, Global Foundries, 
and Samsung. These five companies in 
line for tens of billions of dollars of 
corporate welfare made over $75 tril-
lion in profit last year. 
The American people are sick and 
tired of our government working for 
wealthy campaign contributors and for 
the Big Money interests. I know it is a 
radical 
concept 
to 
suggest, 
but 
maybe—just maybe—we might want to 
be working for ordinary working-class 
and middle-class Americans. 
Let me talk a little bit about what 
our amendments would do. Our amend-
ments are very simple. 
The 
first 
amendment, 
obviously, 
would prevent microchip companies 
from receiving taxpayer assistance un-
less they agree to issue warrants or eq-
uity stakes to the Federal Govern-
ment. If private companies are going to 
benefit from over $53 billion in tax-
payer subsidies, the financial gains 
made by these companies must be 
shared with the American people, not 
just wealthy shareholders. In other 
words, all this amendment says is that 
if these companies want taxpayer as-
sistance, we are not going to socialize 
all of the risks and privatize all of the 
profits. If these investments turn out 
to be profitable as a direct result of 
these Federal grants, the taxpayers of 
this country have a right to get a re-
turn on this investment. 
This is not a radical idea. These are 
exact conditions that were imposed on 
corporations that received taxpayer as-
sistance in the bipartisan CARES Act, 
which passed the Senate 96 to 0. It is 
not a radical idea. 
I believe in industrial policy. That 
means the government works with the 
private sector. It does not mean that 
the government simply gives the pri-
vate sector everything they want with 
no protection to the taxpayer. So if the 
result of these $53 billion in grants is 
these companies make money, that is 
good—that is good—but the taxpayers 
who helped invest in these new produc-
tion facilities should be able to enjoy 
some of those profits as well and get 
some of that money returned to them. 
The second amendment is really a 
very, very simple one. It asks: Why in 
God’s name would we be giving $10 bil-
lion to a company owned by the second 
wealthiest person in this country, Jeff 
Bezos? If Mr. Bezos wants to go to the

Moon, if he wants to go to Mars, he 
wants to go to Saturn, that is his busi-
ness. He has every right in the world to 
do that, but he does not have a right to 
ask the taxpayers of this country for 
$10 billion to help him make his trip to 
outer space. This second amendment 
simply eliminates that $10 billion grant 
that goes to Mr. Bezos. 
I look forward to winning the support 
for these two important amendments, 
which I think are strongly supported 
by the American people.

NOMINATION OF ERIC M. 
GARCETTI 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 2 
weeks ago, I introduced a statement 
into the RECORD which indicated my 
intent to object to any unanimous con-
sent request relating to the nomina-
tion of Mayor Eric Garcetti to be U.S. 
Ambassador to the Republic of India. I 
did so because I had received multiple 
whistleblower complaints that Mayor 
Garcetti witnessed and was aware that 
his deputy chief of staff, Rick Jacobs, 
sexually harassed city employees. In 
my statement, which I have copied 
below, I made clear that I needed to in-
vestigate the allegations being made 
by whistleblowers and that I needed to 
review the investigation that the city 
of 
Los 
Angeles 
had 
commissioned 
which 
supposedly 
cleared 
Mayor 
Garcetti of any wrongdoing. 
At the time, I instructed my staff to 
complete this investigation in no more 
than 2 weeks, since it is not my intent 
to drag this out. My staff spoke with 
additional whistleblowers and subse-
quently made three separate requests 
to representatives of the mayor to send 
us the city’s investigative report—on 
March 11, 18, and 21. The mayor’s staff 
provided me with a copy of the report 
on March 21. However, we were just no-
tified last night, March 23, that there 
was also an updated report, along with 
a summary that was completed several 
months after the original report that 
my office received on March 21. 
While I am still reviewing this re-
port, my staff informs me that the re-
port is focused exclusively on allega-
tions made that Mr. Jacobs sexually 
harassed an LAPD officer. It does not 
address other allegations made, includ-
ing allegations that Mr. Jacobs had 
sexually harassed the mayor’s senior 
staff and made racist comments toward 
staff in front of the mayor. 
Due to the extremely narrow scope of 
this report, the fact that many of the 
allegations brought to my office were 
not investigated in that report, and the 
fact that we only received the updated 
report last night, I have instructed my 
staff to continue investigating these 
allegations. 
As I said earlier, it is not my intent 
to drag this out and I anticipate that 
my investigation will be concluded in 
the near future. 
[Prior Statement] 
Mr. President, I intend to object to any 
unanimous consent request at the present 
time relating to the nomination of Mayor 
Eric Garcetti, of California, to be the U.S. 
Ambassador to the Republic of India. 
I will object because I have received nu-
merous credible allegations from multiple 
whistleblowers alleging that Mr. Garcetti, 
while Mayor of Los Angeles, had knowledge 
of sexual harassment and assaults allegedly 
committed against multiple city employees 
and their associates by his close advisor, and 
that he ignored the misconduct. The allega-
tions involving the mayor’s office have been 
the subject of public reporting and a purport-
edly independent investigation. However, se-
rious questions remain regarding the alleged 
misconduct, as well as the mayor’s knowl-
edge of that misconduct. 
First, whistleblowers who have spoken 
with my office have not previously spoken to 
the Foreign Relations Committee, and are 
presenting new allegations that must be 
fully investigated. 
Second, the investigation of the Los Ange-
les mayor’s office reportedly found no wrong-
doing by the mayor or his staff. However, in-
formation provided by multiple whistle-
blowers strongly suggests that this inves-
tigation was incomplete at best. The extent 
to which the investigation was truly inde-
pendent is also not clear, and the report has 
not been made public. 
The United States owes it to the Republic 
of India to send them a qualified Ambassador 
that will represent the values of the United 
States. Mayor Garcetti may very well be 
fully qualified, but at this time, the Senate 
needs to look into these allegations further. 
So until my staff and I have conducted a 
thorough investigation and are able to speak 
with everyone involved I cannot vote to con-
firm Mr. Garcetti.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Bahrain—M270 Multiple Launch Rocket 
Systems (MLRS) Upgrade. 
The Government of Bahrain has requested 
to buy upgrades to nine (9) M270 Multiple 
Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to a M270 
A1 minimum configuration. The upgrade will 
include: the Common Fire Control System 
(CFCS); Improved Launcher Mechanical Sys-
tem (ILMS); 600h Engine and associated en-
gine compartment modifications; Improved 
Electronics Distribution Box (IEDB); fan 
speed control valve; cables and mounting 
hardware, Power Take Off (PTO) and BOO se-
ries transmission; the Digital Communica-
tion Systems (DCOMMS); and Vehicular 
Intercom System (AN/VIC–3). In addition, 
the effort will include two (2) years spare 
parts; Operator and Maintenance Training 
Course’ Contractor Logistics Support; U.S. 
Government engineering support; support 
and test equipment; integration and test 
support, software delivery and support; pub-
lications and technical documentation; tech-
nical and logistics support services; storage; 
and other related elements of logistical and 
program support. The estimated total cost is 
$175.98 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a Major Non-NATO Ally that is an important 
force for political stability and economic 
progress in the Middle East. 
The proposed sale will improve Bahrain’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by enhancing Bahrain’s ability to de-
fend itself against regional malign actors 
and improve interoperability with systems 
operated by U.S. forces and other Gulf coun-
tries. Bahrain’s continued investment in its 
defensive capabilities is crucial to protecting 
its borders, energy infrastructure, and its 
residents, including over 15,000 U.S. citizens 
and Naval personnel living and working in 
the country. Bahrain will have no difficulty 
absorbing these upgraded MLRSs into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be the Lock-
heed Martin Corporation, Bethesda, MD. 
There are no known offset agreements pro-
posed in connection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Bahrain. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Multiple Launch Rocket System 
(MLRS) is a high-mobility automatic system 
based on an M270 weapons platform. The 
MLRS fires surface-to-surface rockets: the 
Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) 
and the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Sys-
tem (GMLRS). Without leaving the cab, the 
crew of three (driver, gunner and section 
chief) can fire up to 12 MLRS rockets in 
fewer than 60 seconds. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
Government of Bahrain can provide substan-
tially the same degree of protection for the 
sensitive technology being released as the 
U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in 
furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Bah-
rain.

RECOGNIZING UTAH’S GOLD STAR 
FAMILIES 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today 
on behalf of a grateful nation to pay 
tribute to the unparalleled sacrifices of 
Utah’s Gold Star families. Thank you 
for your commitment to defending the 
Constitution 
of 
our 
great 
Nation. 
Thank you for your selfless service to 
others. And thank you for your love of 
our country, the United States of 
America. It is essential to our Nation’s 
survival that we recognize and remem-
ber the sacrifices you have made. 
Given the extraordinary nature of 
your sacrifices, the duty of recognizing 
and remembering them is of utmost 
importance. Furthermore, in a time 
when our Nation’s cardinal values are 
more regularly attacked, this work 
mends the fraying fabric of freedom. 
My purpose today is to honor all that 
you, the Gold Star families of Utah, 
have done for our Nation and its citi-
zens. 
On August 1, 2020, a group of Utahns 
gathered at the North Ogden City Hall. 
There, in the heat of summer, the fami-
lies, friends, and neighbors of fallen 
soldiers came together with business 
leaders and government officials to 
dedicate the North Ogden City Gold 
Star Families Memorial Monument. 
This monument, the first of its kind in 
Utah, but not the last, recognizes and 
remembers the sacrifices of Utah’s 
Gold Star families. A similar monu-
ment has been built in St. George and 
will soon be dedicated. The monuments 
stand as beacons of light and hope, 
tributes to those who have been lost. 
The idea for these monuments was 
inspired by the work of the Woody Wil-
liams Foundation whose mission is ‘‘to 
honor, recognize, and serve Gold Star 
Families and the legacy of their Loved 
Ones who have paid the ultimate sac-
rifice.’’ Their work, which focuses on 
the philosophical pillars of homeland, 
family, patriot, sacrifice, and legacy, 
gave North Ogden City and St. George 
a vision of what was possible. 
After seeing the monument in North 
Ogden City, stakeholders in St. George 
decided they would raise funds, find 
land, and construct a monument of 
their own. St. George City, with the 
help of numerous residents and busi-
nesses began the work of designating 
space, securing over $100,000 of funding, 
and planning construction for the 
monument. The committee worked 
tirelessly to unify, educate, heal, and 
inspire others. Months of work led to a 
beautiful monument which now stands 
to honor Gold Star families and the 
losses they have endured. 
Eight feet tall and 13 feet wide, the 
monuments made of solid black granite 
are two-sided tributes to the fallen. 
One side of each monument bears the 
words: ‘‘Gold Star Families Memorial 
Monument, a tribute to Gold Star 
Families and Relatives who sacrificed 
a Loved One for our Freedom.’’ The 
other side tells a story across four 
granite panels highlighting the themes 
of homeland, family, patriot, and sac-
rifice. The most significant component 
of each monument is a gaping hole at 
the center of the solid granite slabs. 
The empty space, a silhouette of a sa-
luting servicemember, represents the 
legacy of the loved ones of the Gold 
Star families who paid the ultimate 
sacrifice for our freedom. Together, 
these features tell each community’s 
unique story of sacrifice. 
On the day of the dedication of the 
North Ogden monument, powerful sto-
ries and memories were shared. I want 
to highlight just a few. 
Kirk Chugg, the director of Follow 
the Flag North Ogden, said there could 
be ‘‘no better place [for the tribute]. As 
people go about their day, we hope 
they see the monument and teach their 
children what it means. It publicly pro-
claims to families that we have not for-
gotten them.’’ 
‘‘This will help us remember what 
America is all about,’’ said Debbie 
Allen, mother of the late Lt. Kenneth 
‘‘Kage’’ Allen. ‘‘I think too many peo-
ple forget what we stand for.’’ 
James Laselute, of Layton, was there 
representing 
his 
stepson, 
the 
late 
Lance Cpl. Quinn Keith. He said: ‘‘For 
our family, things like this help us 
through the grieving process and re-
mind us that our loved one’s legacy en-
dures.’’ He continued: ‘‘Monuments 
like this are what keeps their name 
alive.’’ 
Neal Berube, the mayor of North 
Ogden City at the time of the monu-
ment’s dedication shared: ‘‘The Gold 
Star designation dates back to World 
War I, when military families dis-
played service flags featuring a blue 
star for every immediate family mem-
ber serving in the Armed Forces. The 
star’s color would change to gold if a 
loved one died so the community would 
know the price the family had paid for 
freedom.’’ 
Mayor Berube then concluded: ‘‘The 
strength of our nation is our military. 
The strength of our military is our sol-
diers. And the strength of our soldiers 
are our families.’’ 
As the people of St. George set out to 
dedicate their Gold Star Families Me-
morial Monument, similar sentiments 
have been shared. Jennifer Moxon, 
Bronwyn Mount, and Mayor Michele 
Randall—who, with the help of the St. 
George City Council, staff, and in part-
nership with the Major Brent Taylor 
Foundation, have helped lead the de-
velopment of the St. George monu-
ment—have made powerful statements 
of gratitude and hope.

Sgt. Douglas Lee Moxon, recently

wrote: ‘‘We are a family military. The 
very freedoms that we sometimes take 
for granted are what our sons and 
daughters fight for every day.’’ She 
continued: ‘‘When we lost our son, my 
perspective changed. The sacrifices 
these servicemembers and their fami-
lies make every day are deserving of 
respect and honor. This monument al-
lows us to pay tribute to the family 
members who lost loved ones. It is a 
place where we can come, feel peace, 
and hopefully recognize their sacrifice 
will never be forgotten.’’ 
Gold Star Mother Bronwyn Mount, 
mother of the late Sgt. Bryan Cooper 
Mount, recently shared: ‘‘I am con-
stantly surprised by the realization 
that so many people all over the coun-
try are remembering and honoring Coo-
per. To have so many people working 
towards this dedication, for the last 20 
months, has been humbling to our fam-
ily. To have multiple friends and fami-
lies be willing to donate to the cost of 
the memorial has touched us deeply. 
We are so grateful to be able to visit 
the memorial and think of Cooper’s, 
and others’, sacrifices. We are grateful 
for a community that cares about the 
sacrifice.’’ 
Mayor Michele Randall shared: ‘‘On 
August 6th, 2020, Sgt. Cooper Mount’s 
flag-draped casket arrived at the St. 
George airport. Moved by the emotion 
and patriotism of the procession from 
the airport to the mortuary, the City 
of St. George chose to be the second 
city in Utah to install a Gold Star 
Families Memorial Monument in the 
heart of the city at historic Town 
Square. Saturday, March 26th, 2022, 
will be the dedication of the memorial 
and the culmination of many hours of 
work and over $100,000 dollars raised by 
our residents. I cannot wait for our 
community to see this breathtaking 
monument in remembrance of our Gold 
Star families.’’ 
I am honored to have the opportunity 
to highlight the great work that so 
many people freely participated in to 
make this memorial, which recognizes 
and remembers the sacrifices of Utah’s 
Gold Star families, possible. These 
monuments are not the last of their 
kind in Utah or in the United States. 
More monuments are being discussed, 
planned, and constructed. The move-
ment to honor Gold Star families 
across America has taken hold of many 
communities throughout the country. 
Let us not allow this movement to 
rise in relevance for a moment and 
then fade. Let us recognize and remem-
ber, forever, the sacrifices of our Na-
tion’s Gold Star families.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING OUR BEST 
RESTAURANT 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Our Best 
Restaurant of Smithfield, KY, as the 
Senate Small Business of the Week. 
In 1990, the late Kenneth Way and his 
wife Kay embarked on a new adventure 
in the autumn of their lives. After re-
tiring from a career in the retail indus-
try, Kenneth bought an old wheat mill 
in Smithfield, KY, population 100. 
Joined by his wife Kay who had just re-
tired from her career serving the Ken-
tucky 
State 
government, 
the 
two 
opened Our Best Restaurant. Kenneth’s 
son Kenny Way will tell you himself 
that his father was not in the res-
taurant business; he was in the ‘‘people 
business.’’ Kenneth’s motto was that if 
you treat people well, your business 
will succeed no matter what you do. 
Clearly, Kenneth was on to something 
as his restaurant and legacy continue 
to thrive for the past 32 years. 
Kenneth’s son Kenny Way now owns 
and operates the business, carrying on 
his father’s mission of providing top 
quality service to everyone who walks 
in the door. Though Our Best Res-
taurant consistently serves delicious 
country cooking, it is the warm and 
friendly atmosphere that keeps people 
coming back time and time again. 
With a population as small as Smith-
field’s, the restaurant cannot depend 
on the typical walk-in customer that 
other Main Street businesses often see; 
their bread and butter are the locals— 
and even visitors, who keep coming 
back. A change in ownership never 
stopped their ‘‘regulars’’ from choosing 
Our Best Restaurant because Kenny 
learned from his late father that a 
loyal customer will only come back if 
you treat them right. That is why the 
staff of Our Best Restaurant put in 
such an effort to get to know their cus-
tomers, to meet their families and 
their children, to ask them about their 
day, and to show that they care about 
the customer’s experience beyond just 
the meal. 
Such high-quality customer service 
and food have allowed Our Best Res-
taurant to grow and expand. Since 1990, 
they have expanded their dining space 
and have branched out to offer catering 
services asides from their dine-in oper-
ations. The catering business became a 
crucial stream of revenue for the res-
taurant as the COVID–19 pandemic put 
a temporary end to in-person dining. 
Local energy and utility companies 
turned to Our Best Restaurant to safe-
ly serve meals to their employees dur-
ing the height of the pandemic. Our 
Best 
Restaurant 
has 
consistently 
proved to be a steadfast member of the 
small community of Smithfield. The 
restaurant maintains great relation-
ships with the local high school, look-
ing out for the local students and al-
ways feeding them a hearty meal of 
Kentucky country cooking. 
The reputation of the feel-good-food 
and friendly atmosphere of Our Best 
Restaurant has allowed them to be a 
destination in themselves. They often 
have folks drive in from Jefferson 
County and Franklin County to enjoy 
their famous cooking. And of course, 
any and all visitors receive the same 
smalltown welcome as any Smithfield 
local would. Our Best Restaurant is the 
entrepreneurial embodiment of the late 
Kenneth and Kay’s dream come true 
and a wonderful example of a father’s 
mission carried on by his son. All 
across the country are little towns like 
Smithfield, areas that contain little 
more than a post office and a church, 
and it is businesses like Our Best Res-
taurant that keep those small commu-
nities 
thriving. 
Congratulations 
to 
Kenny, his son Aric, and the entire Our 
Best Restaurant team. I wish them the 
best of luck and look forward to watch-
ing their continued growth and success 
in Kentucky.∑

INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND

The following bills and joint resolu-
tions were introduced, read the first

By Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. CRAPO, 
and Mr. SCOTT of Florida): 
S. 3912. A bill to amend the National Labor

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Ms. 
BALDWIN, Ms. SMITH, and Mr. 
MURPHY): 
S. 3913. A bill to amend the Public 
Health Service Act with respect to pub-
lic health data accessibility, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. 
KAINE. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic has caused ex-
traordinary challenges for our Nation’s 
public health system and put a spot-
light on longstanding gaps in public 
health preparedness. Our Nation’s pub-
lic health system needs accurate, time-
ly, and high-quality data to protect the 
public from emerging health threats 
and to respond to existing public 
health emergencies. 
For far too long, gaps in data infra-
structure have prevented policymakers 
and public health officials from quick-
ly translating public health data into 
their decisionmaking. Outdated and in-
consistent public health data systems 
have made it hard for Federal, State, 
local, Tribal, and territorial public 
health departments to get a full pic-
ture of the COVID–19 crisis. In turn, 
these data gaps have made it difficult 
for public health departments to tailor 
their responses. Specifically, incon-
sistent definitions of data, ambiguous 
reporting requirements, and data ac-
cessibility issues have hindered the 
U.S. response to the COVID–19 pan-
demic and prevented the timely com-
munication of public health data. 
We know that effective pandemic 
prevention and response requires co-
ordinated efforts between public health

S1776 
March 24, 2022 
officials across all levels of govern-
ment. Today, I am pleased to introduce 
with my colleagues, Senators BALDWIN, 
SMITH, and MURPHY, the Improving 
Data Accessibility Through Advance-
ments in Public Health Act, or the Im-
proving DATA in Public Health Act, to 
use the lessons learned from the 
COVID–19 pandemic to ensure that our 
Nation’s public health system has the 
data capabilities to address and pre-
vent future pandemics. 
The 
Improving 
DATA 
in 
Public 
Health Act amends public health data 
systems’ modernization provisions in 
current law by establishing a timeline 
for the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention to disseminate data stand-
ards to improve the exchange of elec-
tronic public health data. The bill also 
directs the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services to 
expand the access, exchange, and use of 
public health data by improving data 
sharing between Federal Agencies and 
State and local public health systems 
when preparing for, identifying, moni-
toring, and responding to public health 
emergencies. 
The 
Improving 
DATA 
in 
Public 
Health Act also expands upon existing 
data modernization efforts by commis-
sioning a study on improving elec-
tronic data standards and reporting be-
tween laboratories and public health 
data systems. Finally, the legislation 
calls for the development of best prac-
tices to improve the quality and com-
pleteness of demographic data to sup-
port equitable public health responses. 
The 
Improving 
DATA 
in 
Public 
Health Act will strengthen our public 
health data systems and take common-
sense steps to improve our ability to 
prevent 
and 
respond 
to 
future 
pandemics. 
By Mr. HEINRICH (for himself 
and Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 3918. A bill to establish programs 
to improve family economic security 
by 
breaking 
the 
cycle 
of 
multigenerational 
poverty, 
and 
for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleague from New 
Mexico, Senator HEINRICH, in intro-
ducing the Two-Generation Economic 
Empowerment Act. Our bipartisan bill 
would support an innovative approach 
to fighting poverty, one that focuses on 
addressing the needs of children and 
their parents or other primary care-
giver—two-generations 
together—in 
order to help break the cycle of inter-
generational poverty. 
Far too many American families are 
living below the poverty line, and the 
prolonged public health and economic 
crisis has exacerbated this problem. In 
2020, when COVID–19 shut down our 
communities and economy, we unfortu-
nately saw the first increase in poverty 
after 5 consecutive years of decline. 
Nearly 38 million people, or about 1 in 
10 Americans, lived below the poverty 
line in 2020. Sadly, this includes nearly 
11 million children, 35,000 of whom live 
in Maine. Despite recent progress, 
Maine’s child poverty rate is still high-
er than all of the other New England 
States except Rhode Island. 
While Federal programs have helped 
many of those living in poverty man-
age day-to-day hardships, they are fall-
ing short of breaking the cycle of pov-
erty that has trapped too many fami-
lies. As Tomas Philipson, an economist 
who served previously as the Acting 
Chairman of the Council of Economic 
Advisers, recently wrote in the Wall 
Street Journal, ‘‘you don’t cut poverty 
by increasing reliance on government. 
You do it by making them self-reli-
ant.’’ 
Our legislation marks an important 
first step toward reevaluating our ap-
proach to poverty-reducing programs 
and encouraging innovative, more ef-
fective uses of taxpayer dollars. We 
support an approach aimed at equip-
ping both parents and their children 
with the tools they need to have oppor-
tunities to succeed and become self- 
sufficient. Oftentimes, Federal pro-
grams intended to help low-income in-
dividuals address challenges in silos, 
over looking the fact that the needs of 
family members are usually inter-
connected. Our bill seeks to change 
that. For example, helping a mother 
secure safe, high-quality childcare can 
have a positive impact on her ability to 
succeed in the workforce, as well as im-
proving her child’s ability to be ready 
for school. While that child receives 
care and an education, her mother can 
connect with skills training that could 
lead to a better paying job. Connecting 
various Federal programs that target 
both parents and children with sup-
ports aimed at increasing economic se-
curity, educational success, social cap-
ital, and health and well-being has the 
potential to lift whole families out of 
poverty. 
Listen to the story of Kaytlyn Rob-
bins, a mother of four who recently re-
located to Windham, ME, from Aroos-
took County, where a two-generation, 
or whole family, approach to economic 
mobility helped her turn her life 
around. I had the privilege of meeting 
Kaytlyn in August 2020 at a roundtable 
hosted by the Aroostook County Com-
munity Action Program, ACAP. 
When Kaytlyn first connected with 
ACAP, she was living in a homeless 
shelter, battling with substance use, 
and had just lost custody of her young 
daughter. 
With 
the 
assistance 
of 
ACAP’s Whole Family Program, she 
worked with a career counselor to set 
new goals for herself and created a cus-
tomized plan to refocus and transform 
her life. 
ACAP established a work experience 
for Kaytlyn at a local recovery center 
in Caribou, which later became a full- 
time job. She was able to secure safe 
housing and was reunited with her 
daughter, whom the team assisted with 
childcare placement. Kaytlyn is now 
thriving and told me she is ‘‘healing as 
a family unit.’’ She is married and has 
a new baby who just turned 1. Profes-
sionally, she is now a registered recov-
ery coach and recently started up a 
nonprofit dedicated to substance use 
disorder 
recovery 
coaching, 
peer 
groups, 
and 
community 
education. 
Kaytlyn and her family are just one ex-
ample of how the two-generation ap-
proach can truly transform a family 
and put them on a path towards eco-
nomic independence. With legislation 
like 
the 
Two-Generation 
Economic 
Empowerment Act, I am confident we 
can recreate thousands of success sto-
ries like Kaytlyn’s and expand upon 
successful programming like that of-
fered by ACAP. 
Specifically, the bill we are intro-
ducing would codify an Interagency 
Council on Economic Mobility to bet-
ter coordinate Federal efforts that are 
aimed at supporting vulnerable fami-
lies and moving them out of poverty. 
The council would also make rec-
ommendations to Congress about ways 
to improve coordination of anti-pov-
erty programs and to identify best 
practices. While I applaud ongoing ef-
forts across the Federal Government to 
implement two-generation strategies, 
this 
council 
is 
needed 
to 
tackle 
logistical challenges, such as lack of 
coordination 
and 
communication 
across Agencies—and in some cases dif-
ferent entities within a single Depart-
ment—and to improve the dissemina-
tion of information and best practices. 
In fact, a recent nonpartisan Govern-
ment Accountability Office, GAO, re-
port that Senator Heinrich and I re-
quested confirmed that more coordina-
tion at the Federal level would provide 
the critical assistance and flexibility 
States and localities need to develop 
and implement two-gen policies to im-
prove family well-being. This report 
from 2020 underscores why adoption of 
our legislation, particularly its empha-
sis on increasing the coordination of 
services, is critical to a robust two-gen 
approach. 
Our bill would also authorize a per-
formance pilot program that would 
provide additional flexibility for States 
and local governments to improve the 
administration 
of 
poverty-reducing 
programs. To-Generation Performance 
Partnerships would be piloted in five 
States, which would be able to blend 
similarly purposed funds across mul-
tiple Federal programs. Two-genera-
tion 
approaches 
are 
often 
created 
‘‘from the bottom up,’’ meaning local 
organizations and States are at the 
forefront of responding to local or re-
gional needs. The Federal Government 
should be empowering States and local 
organizations with the flexibility to be 
creative problem solvers. For this rea-
son, our legislation would reduce dupli-
cative reporting and application re-
quirements that may deter local agen-
cies and organizations from making 
the most effective use of taxpayer dol-
lars. To ensure accountability, the bill 
would require that these pilot pro-
grams be targeted at specific, poverty- 
reducing outcomes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1777 
March 24, 2022 
With the Two-Generation Economic 
Empowerment Act, we have the chance 
to make a permanent difference in the 
lives of families and to break the 
multigenerational cycle of poverty. 
Just as a child’s ZIP Code should not 
determine his or her future success, the 
current bureaucratic, siloed approach 
to aid should not stand in the way of 
helping families escape poverty. As As-
cend at the Aspen Institute—a key 
partner on this legislation—recently 
observed, ‘‘Today’s economic and pub-
lic health crisis demands the innova-
tion, inclusiveness, collaboration, co-
ordination, and flexibility that the 
2Gen approach provides.’’ 
In addition to strong support from 
national organizations like Ascend at 
the Aspen Institute and National Com-
munity Action Partnership, the Maine 
Community Action Partnership and 
the Maine Head Start Directors’ Asso-
ciation have endorsed this important 
legislation. I very much appreciate 
their support. 
I urge my colleagues to join in sup-
porting this innovative approach to 
moving families out of poverty by giv-
ing them the tools they need to suc-
ceed. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ, 
and 
Mr. 
WARNOCK): 
S. 3929. A bill to provide for disadvan-
taged business enterprise supportive 
services programs at modal adminis-
trations of the Department of Trans-
portation, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Environment and 
Public Works. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Disadvan-
taged Business Enterprise Supportive 
Services Expansion Act and the Accel-
erating Small Business Growth Act, 
which I introduced today. 
The unprecedented investment in 
American infrastructure over the next 
decade provides a major opportunity to 
strengthen our most underserved busi-
nesses and communities. Providing re-
sources to help develop women-owned, 
minority-owned, 
and 
disadvantaged 
businesses will uplift our entire econ-
omy, and it is how we truly build back 
better. 
Last year, President Biden set a goal 
of increasing the share of Federal con-
tracts going to small, disadvantaged 
businesses by 50 percent by 2025, which 
would translate to an additional $100 
billion for these businesses. 
To help accomplish this ambitious 
goal, we should empower Federal, 
State, and local agencies to deliver re-
sources to underserved businesses to 
help them become self-sufficient and 
grow. 
Established in 1970, the Federal High-
way Administration’s Disadvantaged 
Business Enterprise Supportive Serv-
ices Program already provides train-
ing, 
assistance, 
and 
services 
to 
minority- and women-owned businesses 
to help them develop into self-suffi-
cient organizations that viably com-
pete for federally assisted highway 
project contracts. Unfortunately, Con-
gress has not allowed this program to 
keep up with the needs of our under-
served businesses. 
The Disadvantaged Business Enter-
prise Supportive Services Expansion 
Act would increase this program’s an-
nual funding cap for the first time in 
nearly 50 years from $10 million to $25 
million. Additionally, the bill would 
create similar programs at the Federal 
Aviation Administration and the Fed-
eral Transit Administration. 
Local, regional, and State agencies 
have also been leaders in developing in-
novative programs to prioritize dis-
advantaged businesses, invest in efforts 
to create equitable competition, and 
promote diverse economic development 
initiatives. 
The 
Accelerating 
Small 
Business 
Growth Act would create a new grant 
program to help transportation agen-
cies across our Nation carry out these 
innovative programs to help under-
served businesses grow and achieve 
proficiency to compete, on an equal 
basis, for contracts and subcontracts in 
federally 
funded 
transportation 
projects. Agencies that receive funding 
through this grant program would be 
required to submit reports to the De-
partment of Transportation evaluating 
the effectiveness of their activities, 
which would help inform future Fed-
eral procurement policymaking. 
I want to thank Representatives 
PETE AGUILAR and JIMMY GOMEZ for co- 
leading these bills with me, and I hope 
colleagues will join us in support of 
this legislation to minority-owned, 
women-owned, and disadvantaged busi-
nesses compete for contracts to develop 
and 
build 
Federal 
infrastructure 
projects funded by the bipartisan infra-
structure law.

THROUGH 
MARCH 
26, 
2022 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL POISON PREVENTION 
WEEK’’ AND ENCOURAGING COM-
MUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED 
STATES TO RAISE AWARENESS 
OF THE DANGERS OF POISONING 
AND PROMOTE POISON PREVEN-
TION 
Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. SCOTT 
of 
South 
Carolina, 
and 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 557 
Whereas the designation of National Poi-
son Prevention Week was first authorized by 
Congress and President Kennedy in 1961 in 
Public Law 87–319 (75 Stat. 681); 
Whereas National Poison Prevention Week 
occurs during the third full week of March 
each year; 
Whereas, as of January 31, 2022, poison cen-
ters have handled more than 1,019,000 cases 
related to the COVID–19 pandemic alone and 
have seen dramatic increases in cases relat-
ing to hand sanitizer and household cleaning 
products; 
Whereas poison control centers responded 
to COVID–19 related surges by conducting 
poison safety and poisoning prevention out-
reach in a virtual format during the COVID– 
19 pandemic; 
Whereas the American Association of Poi-
son Control Centers (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘AAPCC’’) works with the 55 
poison control centers in the United States 
to track— 
(1) more than 1,000 commonly used house-
hold and workplace products that can cause 
poisoning; and 
(2) poisonings and the sources of those 
poisonings; 
Whereas the National Poison Data System 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘NPDS’’) 
database contains over 456,000 products, 
ranging from viral and bacterial agents to 
commercial chemical and drug products; 
Whereas, in 2020, 2,128,198 people called the 
poison help line to reach a poison control 
center; 
Whereas, in 2020, as reported to the 
AAPCC, 93 percent of poison exposures re-
ported to local poison control centers oc-
curred in the home; 
Whereas local poison control centers save 
the people of the United States $1,800,000,000 
in medical costs annually; 
Whereas the AAPCC and poison control 
centers partner with the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug 
Administration, and State, local, Tribal, and 
territorial health departments to monitor 
occurrences of environmental, biological, 
and emerging threats in communities across 
the United States, including food poisoning, 
botulism, and vaping-associated lung injury; 
Whereas, in the United States, more than 
420 children 19 years of age and younger are 
treated in emergency departments for poi-
soning every day, and more than 135 children 
19 years of age and younger die as a result of 
being poisoned each year; 
Whereas, in 2020, children younger than 6 
years of age constituted 42 percent of all poi-
son exposures; 
Whereas, from 2010 to 2021, data from poi-
son control centers revealed a significant in-
crease of an average of 18.8 percent per year 
in the number of intentional suicide patients 
who were adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, 
and that increase disproportionately oc-
curred among female adolescents; 
Whereas, in 2021, poison control centers 
have seen an increase in suspected suicides 
among adolescents 11 to 14 years of age; 
Whereas, in 2020, more than 90,000 children 
19 years of age and younger were treated in 
an emergency room due to unintended pedi-
atric poisoning, and more than 90 percent of 
those incidents occurred in the home, most 
often 
with 
blood 
pressure 
medications, 
ibuprofen, acetaminophen, laundry packets, 
bleach, or sedatives or anti-anxiety medica-
tion; 
Whereas, based on an analysis of the 
NPDS, from 2018 to 2019, there was a 444 per-
cent increase in pediatric magnet ingestion 
cases reported to poison control centers in 
the United States, following the reintroduc-
tion of high-powered magnets to the market; 
Whereas, an analysis of the National Elec-
tronic Injury Surveillance System shows— 
(1) an increased incidence of ingestion of 
dangerous foreign bodies like button bat-
teries and high-powered magnets during the 
COVID–19 pandemic; and 
(2) evidence that parents and caregivers 
sought care for foreign body ingestions ei-
ther because they knew the relative danger 
of the object ingested or because they sought 
advice from available resources like the poi-
son control centers; 
Whereas 70,630 cases of death due to drug 
overdose were reported in the United States 
in 2019, and the majority of those cases, ap-
proximately 71 percent, involved an opioid; 
Whereas, in 2020, the most common medi-
cations that adults called the poison help 
line about were prescription and non-pre-
scription pain relievers, household cleaning 
substances, cosmetics and personal care 
products, and antidepressants; 
Whereas pain medications lead the list of 
the most common substances implicated in 
adult poison exposures, and are the single 
most frequent cause of pediatric fatalities 
reported to the AAPCC; 
Whereas poison control centers issue guid-
ance and provide support to individuals, in-
cluding individuals who experience medica-
tion and dosing errors; 
Whereas more than 35 percent of calls to 
the poison help line are from individuals 20 
years of age or older, with more than 25 per-
cent of those calls involving patients older 
than 50 years of age, and a common reason 
for those calls is therapeutic errors, includ-
ing questions regarding drug interactions, 
incorrect dosing route, timing of doses, and 
double doses; 
Whereas normal, curious children younger 
than 6 years of age are in stages of growth 
and development in which they are con-
stantly exploring and investigating the 
world around them, and are often unable to 
read or recognize warning labels; 
Whereas the AAPCC engages in community 
outreach by educating the public on poison 
safety and poisoning prevention, and pro-
vides educational resources, materials, and 
guidelines to educate the public on poisoning 
prevention; 
Whereas individuals can reach a poison 
control center from anywhere in the United 
States by calling the poison help line at 1- 
800-222-1222 or accessing PoisonHelp.org; 
Whereas, despite regulations of the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission requiring 
that a child-resistant package be designed or 
constructed to be significantly difficult for 
children under 5 years of age to open, or ob-
tain a harmful amount of the contents, with-
in a reasonable time, children can still open 
child-resistant packages; and 
Whereas, each year during National Poison 
Prevention Week, the Federal Government 
assesses the progress made by the Federal 
Government in saving lives and reaffirms the 
national commitment of the Federal Govern-
ment to preventing injuries and deaths from 
poisoning: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the week of March 20 
through March 26, 2022, as ‘‘National Poison 
Prevention Week’’; 
(2) expresses gratitude for the people who 
operate or support poison control centers in 
their local communities; 
(3) expresses gratitude for frontline work-
ers supporting poison prevention during the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
(4) supports efforts and resources to pro-
vide poison prevention guidance or emer-
gency assistance in response to poisonings; 
and 
(5) encourages— 
(A) the people of the United States to edu-
cate their communities and families about 
poison safety and poisoning prevention; and 
(B) health care providers to practice and 
promote poison safety and poisoning preven-
tion.

NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Judiciary Committee has completed its 
hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jack-
son. I enjoyed meeting the nominee. I 
went into the Senate’s process with an 
open mind. 
But after studying the nominee’s 
record and watching her performance 
this week, I cannot and will not sup-
port Judge Jackson for a lifetime ap-
pointment to the Supreme Court. 
First, Judge Jackson refuses to re-
ject the fringe position that Democrats 
should try to pack the Supreme Court. 
Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer 
had no problem denouncing this un-
popular view and defending their insti-
tution. I assumed this would be an easy 
softball for Judge Jackson, but it 
wasn’t. The nominee suggested there 
are two legitimate sides to the issue. 
She testified she has a view on the 
matter but would not share it. She in-
accurately compared her nonanswer to 
a different, narrower question that a 
prior nominee was asked. But Judge 
Jackson, seemingly, actually tipped 
her hand. She said she would be 
‘‘thrilled to be one of however many.’’ 
‘‘However many.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1785 
March 24, 2022 
The 
opposite 
of 
Ginsburg 
and 
Breyer’s sentiment. The most radical 
pro-court-packing fringe groups badly 
wanted this nominee for this vacancy. 
Judge Jackson was the court-packer’s 
pick, and she testified like it. 
Second, for decades, activist judges 
have hurt the country by trying to 
make policy from the bench. This has 
made judicial philosophy a key quali-
fication that Senators must consider. 
President Biden stated he would only 
appoint a Supreme Court Justice with 
a specific approach that is neither 
textualist nor originalist. That is the 
President’s litmus test: No strict con-
structionists need apply. And that 
President picked Judge Jackson. 
If the nominee had a paper trail on 
constitutional issues, perhaps it could 
reassure us, but she doesn’t. When Jus-
tice Gorsuch was nominated to the Su-
preme Court, he had written more than 
200 circuit court opinions that Sen-
ators could actually study. Justice 
Kavanaugh had written more than 300. 
Justice Barrett outpaced them both. 
She wrote almost 100 appellate opin-
ions in just 3 years, plus years of schol-
arship as a star professor that Senators 
could actually examine. 
Judge Jackson has been on the DC 
Circuit for less than a year. She has 
published only two opinions. Before-
hand, Judge Jackson served as a trial 
judge on the district court. She testi-
fied on Tuesday that that role did not 
provide many opportunities to think 
about constitutional interpretation. 
Yet when Senators tried to dig in on 
judicial philosophy, the judge deflected 
and pointed back to the same record 
she acknowledged would not shed much 
light. One Senator simply asked the 
judge to summarize—summarize—well- 
known differences between the ap-
proaches of some current Justices. The 
nominee replied that 2 weeks’ notice 
had not been enough time to prepare 
an answer. 
President Biden said he would only 
nominate a judicial activist. Unfortu-
nately, we saw no reason to suspect 
that he accidentally did the opposite. 
Third, and relatedly, we are in the 
midst of a national violent crime wave 
and exploding illegal immigration. Un-
believably, the Biden administration 
has nevertheless launched a national 
campaign to make the Federal bench 
systemically softer on crime. The New 
York Times calls this a ‘‘sea change.’’ 
Is it more likely the administration 
chose a Supreme Court nominee who 
would push against their big campaign 
or somebody who would be its crowning 
jewel? 
This is one area where Judge Jack-
son’s trial court records provide a 
wealth of information, and it is trou-
bling, indeed. 
The judge regularly gave certain ter-
rible kinds of criminals light sentences 
that 
were 
beneath 
the 
sentencing 
guidelines and beneath the prosecutor’s 
request. 
The judge herself, this week, used the 
phrase ‘‘policy disagreement’’ to de-
scribe this subject. The issue isn’t just 
the sentences. It is also the judge’s 
rhetoric and trial transcript and the 
creative ways she actually bent the 
law. 
In one instance, Judge Jackson used 
COVID as a pretext to essentially re-
write—rewrite—a criminal justice re-
form law from the bench and make it 
retroactive, which Congress, of course, 
had declined to do. She did so to cut 
the sentence of a fentanyl trafficker 
while Americans died in huge numbers 
from overdoses. 
Judge Jackson declined to walk Sen-
ators through the merits of her rea-
soning in specific cases. She just kept 
repeating that it was her discretion 
and if Congress didn’t like it, it was 
our fault for giving her the discretion. 
That is hardly an explanation as to 
why she uses her discretion the way 
she does. 
It was not reassuring to hear Judge 
Jackson essentially say that if Sen-
ators want her to be tough on crime, 
we need to change the law, take away 
her discretion, and force her to do it. 
That response seems to confirm that 
deeply held personal policy views seep 
into her jurisprudence, and that is ex-
actly what the record suggests. 
I will conclude with this. Late on 
Tuesday, after hours of questioning, I 
believe we may have witnessed a tell-
ing moment. Under questioning about 
judicial 
activism, 
Judge 
Jackson 
bluntly said this: 
Well, any time the Supreme Court has five 
votes, then they have a majority for what-
ever opinion they determine. 
That isn’t just a factual observation. 
It is a clear echo of a famous quotation 
from perhaps the most famous judicial 
activist of all time, the archliberal 
William Brennan. 
The late Justice Brennan told people 
the most important rule in constitu-
tional law was ‘‘the Rule of Five.’’ 
With five votes, a majority can do 
whatever it wants. 
That is a perfect summary of judicial 
activism. It is a recipe for courts to 
wander into policymaking and prevent 
healthy democratic compromise. 
This is the misunderstanding of the 
separation of powers that I have spent 
my entire career fighting against. But 
President Biden made that misunder-
standing his litmus test. 
And nothing we saw this week con-
vinced me that either President Biden 
or Judge Jackson’s deeply invested, 
far-left fan club have misjudged her. 
I will vote against this nominee on 
the Senate floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was 
disappointed but not surprised that 
Senator MCCONNELL came to the floor 
and announced that he would not sup-
port the nomination of Ketanji Brown 
Jackson, by President Biden, to fill the 
vacancy of Stephen Breyer on the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
Just this morning, or early after-
noon, we wrapped up the 4-day process 
in the Senate Judiciary Committee to 
consider her nomination, and that is 
why some of the statements which the 
Senator made in justifying his opposi-
tion, I believe, need to be addressed. I 
will be brief in doing so, but I wanted 
to make a record of it quickly. 
It seems that he is concerned, as 
many Republicans are, with the notion 
of packing of the Court. The notion be-
hind that is that the Democrats are in-
spired to appoint some number of new 
Justices to that Court—maybe four— 
and, thereby, tip the balance back to-
ward the Democratic side. 
The question, obviously, before us is, 
Where does that idea come from? 
I will be honest with you, even as 
chairman of the committee, I don’t 
know. I suppose there are some aca-
demics and theorists and researchers 
who believe that is well worthy of con-
versation, but let’s be honest about 
this issue which seems to consume the 
Republicans in the Senate. 
There is only one U.S. Senator who 
has had a direct impact on the com-
position of the U.S. Supreme Court in 
modern memory. Who was that Sen-
ator? It was Senator MITCH MCCON-
NELL, of Kentucky, because he decided 
to keep the Court at eight Justices for 
almost a year after the death of 
Antonin Scalia. He refused to give 
President Obama his constitutional 
and legal option of filling the vacancy 
from the Scalia departure on the 
Court, and for a year, MITCH MCCON-
NELL, for his own political purposes, 
kept the Court’s composition at eight. 
So, when it comes to moving the num-
bers of Justices, he has retired the tro-
phy in modern times because he was 
the one who did it. 
When he starts speculating about the 
possibility of, ‘‘Well, maybe they will 
add one, two, three, or four more Jus-
tices if the Democrats get an oppor-
tunity,’’ I happen to know—and the 
Presiding Officer does as well—that 
nothing is going to happen in changing 
the composition of the Court unless it 
passes the U.S. Senate, which, under 
current rules, requires 60 votes. There 
are currently 50 Democrats and 50 Re-
publicans. So the likelihood of ‘‘pack-
ing the Court’’ is very unlikely in the 
near future unless some decision is 
made by the electorate that dramati-
cally changes that. 
In the meantime, we are in a situa-
tion wherein we have a vacancy on the 
Court which we are trying to fill with 
a very competent person, and this no-
tion of packing the Court being the No. 
1 issue in deciding is beyond me. There

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1786 
March 24, 2022 
is no sinister conspiracy that I am even 
aware of that suggests that this is an 
agenda item for the Democrats. Of 
course, we would like to see the Court 
be more sympathetic to our point of 
view, but there is no grand plan for 
this to happen. 
Incidentally, the Constitution of the 
United States—I usually keep a copy in 
my desk here—does not mandate the 
number of Supreme Court Justices. We 
have had various numbers over the 
years, and we arrived at the number of 
nine in 1869. I believe that was the 
year. So it has been a tradition on the 
Court since that time. 
The answer by Ketanji Brown Jack-
son—a Federal judge, a DC Circuit 
judge—was the obvious answer when 
asked about whether she wanted to 
pack the Court. She said: Senator, that 
is not my job. I would be a judge. You 
are a legislator, and you would have 
the power, if you wished, to change the 
composition of the Court. I, as a judge, 
don’t have that authority. 
So to make that the No. 1 reason you 
can’t support her nomination is less 
than compelling. 
The second thing he raised was one 
we heard over and over again. Judge 
Jackson, what is your philosophy? Tell 
us your philosophy when it comes to 
the Court. What is your judicial philos-
ophy? We want to make sure we know. 
Well, there are different schools of 
thought when it comes to the Constitu-
tion. Antonin Scalia was a so-called 
originalist, and Supreme Court Justice 
Kavanaugh is a textualist, I believe, 
and there may be many other schools 
of thought. 
The bottom line is, she has said: I 
have published 578 written opinions. If 
you want to know what I think about 
the law, here is my body of work—take 
a look at it—on almost every topic 
under the Sun. 
So, if you want to know how she 
rules and what she thinks, she can rep-
resent whatever she wishes, but her 
words already speak for themselves. 
She has been very open and has pro-
vided 12,000 pages from her time on the 
Sentencing Commission that also re-
flect her views on very important top-
ics. 
There is also the old saw. We knew it 
was coming. The Republicans are test-
ing their messages for the November 
election, and I will bet you have heard 
some of them. 
One of them is that Democrats are 
soft on crime. They said that about 
Judge Jackson, but they have got a 
problem. Judge Jackson has been en-
dorsed by the Fraternal Order of Po-
lice, the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police, and NOBLE, the Na-
tional Organization of Black Law En-
forcement Executives, in addition to 
other law enforcement leaders. 
She has a history in her family of 
brothers and other members, uncles, 
who have been in law enforcement, 
risking their lives for the safety of 
their communities over and over. One 
of her uncles is the chief of police of 
Miami, FL. 
This woman is no stranger to law en-
forcement. It is part of her family; it is 
part of what she grew up in. To argue 
that she is ‘‘soft on crime’’ ignores the 
obvious. She has got it in her blood. 
She is going to be fair, I am sure, when 
she is on the Supreme Court, but she 
has no prejudice against police groups. 
It is part of her family history. 
There is also the question about giv-
ing light sentences. We spent more 
time on this than one can imagine. 
Three or four Republican Senators 
were dwelling on her sentencing in a 
handful of cases and wouldn’t let go of 
it, day after day for 2 straight days. 
They refused to acknowledge—and the 
reality is—that her choice of sen-
tencing guidelines was within the same 
limits and boundaries of 70 percent of 
current Federal judges; in some re-
gions, 80 percent. She was not out of 
the mainstream; she was directly in 
the mainstream when it came to sen-
tencing. You would think the opposite 
was true. 
When you look at these facts and re-
alize that here is our opportunity to 
put the first African-American woman 
on the U.S. Supreme Court and that 
these are the best arguments they 
could come up with against her, it real-
ly troubles me. 
I sincerely hope—I really hope and 
not just because I want to make sure 
she is on the Court—that we will have 
bipartisan support for her nomination. 
If this turns out to be a strictly par-
tisan vote with this historic oppor-
tunity, it will be sad, sad for our coun-
try and sad as a commentary on where 
the parties are today. 
I am hoping—I am still hoping—that 
several Republicans and, I hope, many 
more will step forward and support her 
nomination. I am disappointed in Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s decision, but I am 
not surprised.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
RETIRING 
SUPER-
INTENDENT HENDERSON LEWIS, 
JR., PHD 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
Dr. Henderson Lewis, Jr. has served as the 
Superintendent of NOLA Public Schools since 
March 18, 2015, becoming one of the young-
est and longest tenured leaders in the 180- 
year history of public education in New Orle-
ans. With over 25 years of educational experi-
ence as a teacher, mentor, assistant principal, 
instructional coach, curriculum expert, prin-
cipal, and school district leader, Super-
intendent Lewis brings a unique, classroom fo-
cused perspective to the table. 
Dr. Lewis first worked for the Algiers Charter 
Schools Association for six years, serving as 
the founding principal at Algiers Technology 
Academy. He taught for seven years at neigh-
boring St. Bernard Parish Public Schools and 
represented District 9 on the St. Bernard Par-
ish Public School Board for 11 years. Dr. 
Lewis then went on to become a celebrated 
superintendent for East Feliciana Parish, 
which is just north of Baton Rouge. Under his 
leadership, the district was recognized by the 
Louisiana Department of Education as second 
in the state for elementary student academic 
growth. Throughout his tenure at New Orleans 
Public Schools, he has not wavered from his 
mission as a citywide regulator of schools, a 
protector of family and student rights, and a 
thoughtful steward of public resources. 
Superintendent Lewis has been at the helm 
of NOLA–PS during a pivotal time in the 
school system’s history. He oversaw the 2018 
unification of public schools in New Orleans 
with those schools run by the state of Lou-
isiana. NOLA–PS now has 76 schools under 
the oversight of the Orleans Parish School 
Board. 
Thanks to his team and his leadership, New 
Orleans community of schools is better struc-
tured today than ever before. NOLA–PS es-
tablished an accountability framework that 
holds charter schools to high standards. Dur-
ing his tenure, Dr. Lewis has worked to add 
strong school options to the portfolio, including 
new and innovative school models, trans-
formations, 
and 
replication 
of 
successful 
school models to provide the best possible op-
tions for students. 
During his time as Superintendent, he faced 
the challenges brought on by the COVID–19 
pandemic. He helped NOLA–PS lead the way 
nationally by building partnerships, using data 
to drive decisions, and leading NOLA Public 
Schools through the COVID–19 pandemic. 
That work has helped NOLA–PS lead the way 
nationally when it came to reopening schools 
with adequate technology, gaining access to 
COVID testing, and securing access to vac-
cines. Dr. Lewis also coordinated the district- 
wide commitment to add the COVID–19 vac-
cine to the list of required vaccinations for stu-
dents five years and up. 
His dedication to promoting equality and eq-
uity led to the renaming of 21 school buildings 
in 2021 to separate the school system of 
today from the dubious honors bestowed in 
the past to slaveholders and segregation sym-
pathizers. He also implemented an equity ini-
tiative within the school district to continue to 
advance public education as a right for all chil-
dren, no matter their race, gender, or eco-
nomic position. 
At the heart of Dr. Lewis’ work remains his 
unwavering commitment to the well-being and 
high-quality education of every child, every 
day.

IN RECOGNITION OF LEROY AR-
THUR 
PETRY 
FOR 
NATIONAL 
MEDAL OF HONOR DAY 2022 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor Mr. Leroy Arthur Petry of 
Santa Fe, New Mexico for his life of service to 
our nation and in recognition of tomorrow’s 
National Medal of Honor Day. 
Just one year after graduating high school, 
Mr. Petry joined the United States Army in 
1999. 
Mr. Petry was deployed eight times. which 
included deployments to support Operation 
Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Free-
dom. 
On May 26, 2008, Mr. Petry and his regi-
ment came under fire from Taliban forces in 
Afghanistan. During this skirmish, he was 
wounded by a round that pierced both of his 
legs. 
Although wounded, Mr. Petry led another 
Ranger to cover. 
When a Taliban fighter threw a grenade that 
landed just a few feet from him and his fellow 
soldiers, Mr. Petry selflessly lunged forward, 
picked up the grenade, and threw it back in 
the direction of the Taliban fighters as it ex-
ploded. 
At great personal cost, Mr. Petry saved the 
lives of his fellow soldiers. 
For his courageous actions in Afghanistan, 
Mr. Petry was awarded the Congressional 
Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama 
on July 12, 2011. He is the second living re-
cipient of the medal after the Vietnam War. 
Mr. Petry continues to serve his fellow vet-
erans and his community. I am thankful to Mr. 
Petry for his service and tremendous sacrifice 
for our nation. It is an honor to represent him 
in Congress.

OF 
COLE EVANS FOR WINNING THE 
DIVISION I WRESTLING STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
wrestler in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Cole Evans, a freshman at Perrysburg High 
School, has represented his school ably on his 
way to achieving the Division I State Wrestling 
Title. Cole overcame the challenges posed by 
intense competition in his effort to win the Di-
vision I State Wrestling Championship. 
In pursuing the State Championship, Cole 
Evans defeated his opponent in the finals of 
the 106-pound classification. His hard work 
and dedication, both on and off the mat, in 
achieving this accomplishment is truly out-
standing. Cole led his team to rank second 
place overall in the championship. He has 
achieved an impressive season record bring-
ing pride to his school and community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to Cole Evans of 
Perrysburg High School. On behalf of the peo-
ple of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to 
recognize this great achievement.

HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember Marvis LaVerne Kneeland Jones, 
a renowned Memphis educator and one of the 
courageous Memphis State Eight who inte-
grated then-Memphis State University in 1959 
following the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 
Brown v. Board of Education ruling (1954) de-
claring segregation of public schools unconsti-
tutional. Mrs. Jones was born in Chicago in 
1941 and was raised in Memphis where she 
graduated from Hamilton High School. She 
obtained a master’s degree from what is now 
the University of Memphis and taught in the 
Memphis City Schools for 25 years. As a civil 
rights trailblazer, her heroic integration of 
Memphis State opened the doors of oppor-
tunity to thousands. In 2006, the University 
honored the Memphis State Eight by recog-
nizing their pioneering work desegregating the 
campus, and Mrs. Jones was among the re-
maining five who returned to the University in 
2019 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of their 
achievement. Mrs. Jones was a marvelous 
singer and piano player and tickled the ivories 
to the delight of audiences. She was married

RECOGNIZING THE 120TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PECARD LEATHER 
CARE COMPANY 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Pecard Leather 
Care Company as they celebrate their 120th 
anniversary. 
The company came from humble beginnings 
when Phil Pecard, resident of Lena, WI, began 
to experiment with formulas to protect, restore, 
and seal leather goods in 1902. Mr. Pecard’s 
mission was to provide the lumbermen of Wis-
consin with the resources they needed to pro-
tect their expensive leather boots in the cold 
and wet environment that was the north 
woods. 
The business continued to grow and shortly 
after World War Two, Mr. Pecard constructed 
a small factory in the Green Bay area and 
later sold his business to a local businessman, 
Arthur Wadzinski. Over the next 20 years, the 
business continued to grow as original for-
mulas were refined and legally patented. The 
company was formally incorporated in 1964 
and a new manufacturing plant was built in 
1975 to accommodate their rapid growth and 
overwhelming success. I commend the Pecard 
Leather Care Company for its service and 
dedication to the craft. 
120 years later, it is more than fitting to take 
time to recognize the company’s pledge in 
continuing the authentic craftsmanship and 
high-quality traditions that began with Mr. 
Pecard. A small idea that began in Lena, WI, 
has grown to serve customers worldwide for 
over a century. I applaud the Pecard Leather 
Care Company for its exceptional work, con-
tinued growth, and success for the past 120 
years. 
I invite all Members of this body to join me 
in celebrating the 120th anniversary of Pecard 
Leather Care Company. I extend my sincerest 
congratulations to the Pecard Leather team on 
this remarkable milestone and wish them suc-
cess for many more years to follow.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
ORIANNE 
& 
PHIL COLLINS’ LITTLE DREAMS 
FOUNDATION 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize The Orianne & Phil Collins’ Little 
Dreams Foundation (LDF). The LDF was 
founded in 2000 and has been headquartered 
in Miami since 2013. The foundation’s goals 
are to provide training and advice for aspiring 
young artists, athletes, and musicians by pair-
ing them with a mentor who is a professional 
in their respective area. 
Being able to extract creative talent out of 
students in Miami is important to Lourdes and 
I. Studies show that when students are intro-
duced to music and the arts at a young age, 
it helps improve cognitive ability particularly in 
the math and sciences. In a world that is rap-
idly evolving and growing technologically, it is 
crucial that students at a young age have the 
ability to compete on a global stage in STEM 
courses. Organizations like The Orianne & 
Phil Collins’ Little Dreams Foundation are cru-
cial for giving students skills that they may not 
necessarily learn inside the classroom. 
Now more than ever are LDF’S contribu-
tions and mission critical to the surrounding 
community. I congratulate The Orianne & Phil 
Collins’ Little Dreams Foundation. I look for-
ward to their continued success and prosperity 
in the future.

IN HONOR OF KRISTI SHREVE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Kristi Shreve who is receiving the 
2020 Hillsborough Schools’ Community Care 
Award. Every year, the Associated Parents’ 
Group of Hillsborough selects a non-resident 
employee who has made sustained, significant 
and lasting contributions that have touched the 
lives of our children and benefited the commu-
nity as a whole. 
Mrs. Shreve is an outstanding educator who 
has dedicated her life to teaching and uplifting 
the next generation. She began teaching in 
Hillsborough 24 years ago as a teacher at 
South Preschool. She became a student- 
teacher at South School and was hired by 
Hillsborough School District in 2002 as a 2nd- 
grade teacher at South. A year later, she 
transferred to West School where she has 
been a 1st through 3rd-grade teacher ever 
since. Mrs. Shreve is a member of the Leader-
ship Team at West, a Data Advisor, a New 
Teacher Mentor, a Teacher in Charge, a 
Technology Mentor, an HTA Site Representa-
tive, HTA Negotiator, and HTA President, 
among the many leadership roles she is hold-
ing. Her work ethic and compassion have 
earned her the respect and adoration of her 
colleagues, students and their parents. 
An essential quality of an outstanding teach-
er is the ability to meet students where they 
are. Mrs. Shreve gets to know each student 
and his or her unique needs. She becomes a 
true advocate and will always go the extra 
mile. With parents, she forms partnerships that 
are characterized by flawless communication, 
strong and trusting relationships, and joint ad-
vocacy for the students. These relationships 
live on beyond their time at the school. 
Mrs. Shreve led the first Tyler Yamagishi 
Walk-a-Thon at West School raising money for 
the Tyler Yamagishi Scholarship Fund and the 
Riekes Center in Menlo Park. Tyler Yamagishi 
was a West student who succumbed to 
osteosarcoma at the young age of 14. The 
Riekes Center is a non-profit community 
space that offers character-building programs 
in art, music, nature awareness, sports train-
ing, and other life skill areas. Mrs. Shreve also 
worked with the Hillsborough Beautification 
Committee and the West Parent Group on the 
memorial tree project in Tyler’s memory. An-
other project that showcased her inexhaustible 
empathy was the ‘‘Love Notes for Montecito.’’ 
All students at West made valentines for stu-
dents and staff at Montecito Union Elementary 
School in Santa Barbara County after dev-
astating fires and mud slides in 2018. 
When not at school, Mrs. Shreve loves to 
spend time with her husband, John, their own 
children, Alyssa and Brendan, and their two 
cats, Snowy and Cookies. They reside in Daly 
City. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in commending Kristi Shreve for being an 
exemplary teacher, one of the most influential 
and noble vocations in shaping our common 
future. She is a role model and an inspiration 
to us all.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
CHIEF 
MELANIE 
MONTROLL, 
ORLEANS 
PARISH 
HARBOR POLICE 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
‘‘Law enforcement is my existence; I have 
strived to make this world a better place for all 
of us. Service to humankind is the only way to 
show appreciation for being chosen by God to 
live this life.’’ 
Those words are Chief Montroll’s mantra 
every day. Born the youngest child to a doting 
police officer father and a loving mother who 
worked in accounting, her parents knew at a 
very early age that she would live a trans-
formative life. 
Chief Montroll was born on New Orleans’ 
Eastbank and was a rambunctious youth filled 
with vigor and determination. She was always 
known to be the life of the classroom, filled 
with jokes and playfulness. Academics came 
easy to her also. Chief Montroll is a graduate 
of Oliver Perry Walker High School in New Or-
leans’ Algiers area and graduated with a 4.0 
average. After her high school graduation, she 
attended community college and concurrently 
made the decision to follow in the footsteps of 
her father and become a police officer. After 
graduating from the Harbor Police Academy, 
Melanie was full steam ahead in her career 
serving the community.

March 24, 2022 
Chief Montroll, while holding a full-time law 
enforcement job at Harbor Police Department, 
enrolled in Southern University at New Orle-
ans and obtained a Bachelor of Science De-
gree in Business Administration. Soon there-
after, she secured her Master’s Degree in 
Business Administration from the University of 
New Orleans. ‘‘Education is the key to doors 
that cannot be opened normally.’’ 
Within two years of her being employed by 
the Harbor Police Department, she was pro-
moted to Corporal, which gave her officer su-
pervisory responsibilities within the depart-
ment. After many awards and accommoda-
tions, she was promoted to Sergeant, which 
included being the Director of Training and the 
Commander of the Marine division. This posi-
tion prepared her to, once again, be promoted. 
This time to Lieutenant, and those responsibil-
ities made her the Commander of the Criminal 
Investigations and Internal Affairs Division. 
As a reward for Chief Montroll’s hard work 
and dedication, she was promoted to Assistant 
Chief of the Harbor Police Department in 2017 
with the rank of Captain. The job included 
Captain of all Platoons, Communications and 
Surveillance Center, Criminal Investigations 
and Internal Affairs, Maritime Security Oper-
ations Center, Bicycle Division, Training Divi-
sion, and the day-to-day operations of the 
Harbor Police Department. She supervised se-
curity guards working under the purview of the 
Harbor Police Department. She was respon-
sible for ensuring adequate and efficient de-
ployment of patrol officers to various sections 
of the Port of New Orleans as well as over-
seeing the Port of New Orleans Fireboat Boat 
and 9-member crew. She was responsible for 
three civilian staff in charge of emergency op-
erations and homeland security. She was re-
sponsible for the fiscal budget for the depart-
ment and responsible for the Port of New Or-
leans remaining compliant with MTSA (Coast 
Guard Regulations) and Commander of Har-
bor Police Department’s Marine Division. She 
served as the liaison for personnel and time 
management for subordinate officers between 
the Harbor Police Department and the Port of 
New Orleans’ Human Relations Division. She 
coordinated working relationships with outside 
law enforcement agencies, including local, 
state, and federal. 
Under the tutelage of Chief Robert Hecker, 
she learned the ins and outs of being the 
Chief of Police. She credits Chief Hecker for 
being an outstanding mentor and role model in 
policing. On Monday, February 28, 2022, after 
a long interview process, Melanie received the 
call that she was selected to be the next Chief 
of Police for the Harbor Police Department. 
Chief Montroll is the first African American fe-
male Chief of Police for the Harbor Police De-
partment and one of the first in the State of 
Louisiana. Chief Montroll is married to Danyell 
Montroll and has a son Daniel and live in the 
Greater New Orleans Metropolitan area. She 
is an inspiring member of our community and 
I congratulate her on this incredible achieve-
ment. 
SUPPORTING H.R. 5001, THE UPPER 
COLORADO 
AND 
SAN 
JUAN 
RIVER BASINS RECOVERY ACT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 5001, the Upper Colorado 
and San Juan River Basins Recovery Act. 
This bipartisan bill would reauthorize and ex-
tend critical endangered fish recovery pro-
grams in the Upper Colorado and San Juan 
River Basins in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, 
and Wyoming. 
The Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish 
Recovery Program was first established in the 
1980s to help bring four species of endan-
gered fish back from the brink of extinction, 
while continuing existing water development 
and ensuring compliance with the Endangered 
Species Act. 
The San Juan River Basin Recovery Imple-
mentation Program was established in 1992, 
and similarly works to protect these endan-
gered fish in the San Juan River sub-basin, a 
part of the larger Upper Colorado River Basin. 
These programs are unique collaborative ef-
forts between local, state and Tribal officials, 
federal agencies, water and power interests, 
and environmental groups—all working to-
gether to recover these endangered species, 
preserve ecosystems, and maintain water de-
velopment. 
These four species of fish are only found in 
the Colorado River Basin—making the work of 
the recovery partners crucial to their recovery. 
Both programs work collaboratively for the re-
covery of these species, and have become 
models for their collaborative conservation ef-
forts to protect endangered species. 
Last year, one of the endangered species in 
the Upper Colorado River Basin—the hump-
back chub—was moved from endangered to 
threatened status due to the many years of ef-
fort from this partnership. Another species— 
the razorback sucker—was also proposed for 
delisting last summer, resulting from the ac-
tions of the recovery programs and their part-
ners over the past 30 years. 
My bill would reauthorize these critical pro-
grams through 2024 and extend current re-
porting deadlines for the Recovery Programs. 
Extending the program authorization an ad-
ditional year allows federal partners to include 
funding for the programs in their three-year 
budgetary planning cycle, and does not raise 
the cost ceiling for the current programs. 
The bill also provides an extension of re-
porting requirements for the recovery pro-
grams—as requested by the program part-
ners—to account for challenges and delays 
due to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I am glad to have the support of several of 
my colleagues from these states as cospon-
sors on this effort, along with the support of 
local and state officials across the Upper Colo-
rado River Basin. 
The technical amendments my bill makes 
are necessary to preserve the functioning of 
these successful programs, and ensure the 
programs are able to continue to operate 
smoothly for an additional year. 
CELEBRATING THE ONE YEAR 
ANNIVERSARY OF NATIVO 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Nativo restaurant in the com-
munity of Highland Park on its one-year anni-
versary. 
Nativo first opened for business in Novem-
ber 2020, but temporarily closed its doors 
amid the rising COVID–19 case count. In Feb-
ruary 2021, the colorful Guadalajara-inspired 
restaurant began to welcome guests again. 
Nativo has been a local, family-owned oper-
ation from day one. Gabriel Paredes, a High-
land Park native, draws inspiration from his 
family roots in the neighborhood and Guadala-
jara, Jalisco. He remembers walking up and 
down York and Figueroa with his grandfather 
selling boots from a beat up old white truck. 
‘‘One of my dreams has always been to come 
back to the neighborhood that has meant so 
much to me,’’ says Paredes. Corissa Her-
nandez, co-owner and wife, is Nativo’s cultural 
liaison. ‘‘We want to create a platform for peo-
ple of color, for women,’’ says Hernandez. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Gabriel Paredes, Corissa 
Hernandez, and Nativo on their one-year anni-
versary. I also extend to all of them my best 
wishes for many more years of success ahead 
and I invite my colleagues to stop by Nativos 
the next time they’re in Los Angeles.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF PERVIS SPANN, ALSO KNOWN 
AS ‘‘THE BLUES MAN’’ 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and celebrate the life and legacy of an 
extraordinary man and broadcast radio icon, 
an on-air personality, and a radio station 
owner: Mr. Pervis Spann. 
Pervis Spann was born in Itta Bean, Mis-
sissippi on August 16, 1932. Growing up, he 
picked cotton and cared for his family when 
his mother fell ill. At age 14, he managed the 
Dixie Theater, a local Black theater. His family 
uprooted from Mississippi and migrated to Bat-
tle Creek, Michigan in search of jobs, edu-
cation, housing, and the right to vote. Spann 
joined the military and fought for our Nation 
during the Korean War. 
In the 1950s, his love for music would lead 
him to his first disc jockey job at WOPA in 
Oak Park, Illinois. In 1960, he organized his 
first concert, which showcased B.B. King and 
Junior Parker. In 1963, Phil and Leonard 
Chess bought a radio station that later be-
came known as WVON. Shortly afterwards, 
Spann was hired by the Chess brothers as a 
disc jockey for their 24-hour blues station. 
Spann became known as the ‘‘The Blues 
Man’’, gaining notoriety with an 87–hour sleep-
less ‘‘sit-in’’ raising money for Civil Rights 
leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 1, 
1963, Spann and his business partner, Wesley 
South, would purchase the radio station and 
create the mantra, ‘‘The Voice of the Negro.’’

tion played a pivotal role in creating a platform 
for community, business, and political leaders. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. could be heard reg-
ularly on the Wesley South Show, Malcolm X 
and Elijah Muhammad were part of the 
evening format, and Mayor Harold Washington 
favored WVON for his public service an-
nouncements. In 1968, WVON was the first 
station in the country to announce the death of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. when Reverend 
Jesse Jackson called from Memphis with the 
news on April 4, 1968. 
In 1975, WVON was sold and changed fre-
quency. Spann formed a business partnership 
with Vernon Jarrett and Wesley South and 
bought the license to the original frequency in 
1979. The new radio station, WXOL, was an 
all-blues format where musicians such as 
Johnny Taylor, Buddy Guy, KoKo Taylor, 
Howlin’ Wolf, Otis Clay, and many others 
could be heard. In 1983, the station reclaimed 
the old call letters of WVON. 
In 2012, Pervis Spann was inducted in the 
Blues Hall of Fame for his contributions in 
media, production, and business. He joined 
legendary musical luminaries such as B.B. 
King, Etta James, Mavis Staples, and Willie 
Dixon. 
Spann was the epitome of the American 
dream—he 
went 
from 
‘sharecropping 
to 
shareholding’. Throughout his life, Spann used 
the radio station as an outlet to cultivate new 
aspiring radio personalities. He was always 
willing to give a helping hand to those who 
needed work and support, and he both recog-
nized talent and encouraged young people to 
pursue a college education. 
Spann, along with his wife, Mrs. Lovie 
Spann, and four children, Melody, Darrell, 
Latrice, and Chante, continued to call the 
South Side of Chicago home for the rest of his 
life. Pervis Spann’s loss is deeply felt across 
Chicago, the nation, and even the world. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily—Lovie, 
Melody, 
Darrell, 
Latrice, 
and 
Chante—and with all who loved and were im-
pacted by this truly great man. 
RECOGNIZING ARLINGTON 
COUNTY’S FIRST RESPONDERS 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of our first responders for their her-
oism during the COVID–19 pandemic and 
every day for their bravery and selflessness. 
Arlington County’s first responders have been 
on the frontlines, making more than 300 trips 
in 2021 to Culpepper Garden, consistently 
risking their own well-being to protect and 
serve our community members. 
I share my colleagues’ enthusiasm in the 
General Assembly and on the Arlington Coun-
ty Board in dedicating the Arlington County 
First Responders Bench at Culpepper Garden 
to recognize and celebrate all first responders 
on this day, March 25, 2022. 
I urge all residents to join the Arlington Net-
work for Community Readiness and help us all 
prepare for and respond to an emergency and 
to sign up for the Disaster Volunteer Registry 
to be a volunteer resource for our area during 
an emergency. 
I also commend the staff and residents of 
Culpepper Garden for enhancing our commu-
nity in so many ways. As a nonprofit retire-
ment community that is home to 450 low-in-
come seniors who live in 346 independent liv-
ing and assisted living apartments, they help 
make our community dynamic and vibrant. 
Please join me in commemorating these he-
roic first responders.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CAREER 
OF MICHAEL LAVOIE 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Fire Chief Michael J. Lavoie, a 
dedicated public servant whose commitment 
to protecting the safety of the people of 
Worcester, Massachusetts has saved count-
less lives over the last three decades. 
Joining the Worcester Fire Department in 
1987, Chief Lavoie served for 14 years as a 
firefighter. He was promoted to lieutenant in 
2001, captain in 2008, and then Worcester 
Fire Safety Division District Chief and North 
End District Chief in 2009 and 2011, respec-
tively. Finally, Chief Lavoie was named chief 
of the Worcester Fire Department in 2017. 
During his tenure, Chief Lavoie led the depart-
ment and the City of Worcester through chal-
lenging times with grace and strength. 
Throughout his career, Chief Lavoie facili-
tated great improvements. He helped imple-
ment training workshops and instituted a Self- 
Contained Breathing Apparatus, which uses 
safety features like a thermal imager and en-
hanced communication capabilities to protect 
the health of firefighters. Chief Lavoie also 
worked tirelessly with Worcester City Manager 
Ed Augustus to bring new vehicles to the de-
partment and to make sure every firetruck was 
always fully staffed. 
Madam Speaker, the impact Chief Lavoie 
had on the Worcester Fire Department cannot 
be understated. He has shown, time and time 
again, incredible leadership and commitment 
to the people of Worcester. 
Chief Lavoie is a public servant, through 
and through. Over the course of his 35–year 
long career, he gave so much to the City of 
Worcester and improved the working condi-
tions of firefighters along the way. I also have 
to thank Chief Lavoie’s family for supporting 
him in his service to our city. Their sacrifice 
has allowed all of us to have a safer place to 
call home. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress and all the people in whose 
lives Chief Lavoie has made a difference, it is 
my great privilege to thank and recognize 
Chief Michael J. Lavoie for his service to the 
people of Massachusetts and his unwavering 
commitment to making a safer world.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF TAFT COLLEGE 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 100th anniversary 
of Taft College and recognize the profound 
contribution the school has made to our com-
munity over the last century. 
Established on August 30, 1922, Taft Col-
lege emerged from humble beginnings. Shar-
ing a campus with Taft Union High School at 
the time, Taft College enrolled 10 students in 
its first year of operation. As one of only 15 
community colleges in California in the early 
1920s, the Taft Union High School District 
Board—the founders of Taft College—envi-
sioned that the school would transform the re-
gion by offering local students unprecedented 
access to higher education. Since then, the 
school has done just that, producing leaders in 
business, law, nursing, education, athletics, 
and public service. 
Today, Taft College is bustling, operating its 
own independent campus of nearly 40 acres 
and its enrollment has grown to 2,400 stu-
dents. With an average class size of 18 stu-
dents, students may enroll in any of the 43 de-
gree and 30 certificate programs offered at 
Taft College and receive high-quality instruc-
tion in fields of study ranging from Liberal Arts 
to Engineering in small group settings. 
Throughout the past century, Taft has prov-
en itself as a leader among community col-
leges. In 1995, the school created the Transi-
tion to Independent Living (TIL) Program and 
in 1997, pioneered a distance learning pro-
gram. The TIL Program is a two-year, post- 
secondary educational program that provides 
training and support for students with develop-
mental or intellectual disabilities and helps 
prepare them to lead confident, self-sufficient 
lives. Taft College’s innovative, first-of-its-kind 
distance learning program offers greater flexi-
bility to students pursuing a degree while bal-
ancing additional priorities at work and in life. 
Both programs have garnered respect and ac-
colades from educational leaders within and 
beyond the Taft community. 
Taft College’s success and the critical role 
that it plays in uplifting individuals throughout 
California’s Central Valley are undeniable. I 
am confident that Taft College will continue to

centennial anniversary, and commemorate its 
enduring contributions to our community.

HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Cao Minh Hung (aka, An-
thony Hung Cao), who co-founded the Cau 
Lac Bo Tinh Nghe Si (Vietnamese Artists 
Friendship Club) in 2010, a non-profit organi-
zation with members from across the United 
States and is well-known among Vietnamese 
community overseas for its activities and con-
tributions in cultural and social events. The 
purpose of the organization is to preserve Vi-
etnamese culture, as well as encouraging and 
promoting new talents in music, art, and lit-
erature. The organization includes a choir of 
more than 50 members and participates in 
many community events throughout the years. 
Dr. Cao Minh Hung practices dentistry in 
Costa Mesa and Long Beach, California. Be-
sides working as a dentist, he spends most of 
his time serving the community through his or-
ganization. He currently serves as a volunteer 
producer and host for television talk shows, 
music programs, and children educational 
shows such as Hat Mam Viet Nam (Seeds of 
Vietnam) on Little Saigon TV and IBC TV. In 
the past 10 years, he has hosted more than 
400 television talk shows to promote music. 
culture, and bring important news to the com-
munity. 
Most importantly, Dr. Anthony Cao Minh 
Hung founded the Youth Talent Development 
Program, which has trained and educated 
nearly 100 young students in the past 6 years. 
The program includes many aspects from 
teaching Vietnamese language through music 
and dance, as well as educating students Viet-
namese culture and history through the Trivia 
Contest Show (aka Do Vui De Hoc), which 
broadcasts weekly on Little Saigon TV. 
The Youth Talent Development Program 
serves youth from 5 to 18 years old with vocal 
and dance classes every Saturday. This free 
program educates students about their cultural 
heritage 
through 
Vietnamese 
songs 
and 
dances, as well as guides them to become fu-
ture leader for the community. In addition, per-
formances on stage help students build con-
fidence in their personal life. 
During the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Cao Minh 
Hung remained active and managed his time 
to produce many virtual shows via Zoom. He 
also advocated for the community’s well-being 
and actively involved in the American Dental 
Society and the California Dental Society. Be-
sides composing nearly 60 songs related to 
Vietnamese culture and history, Dr. Anthony 
Cao Minh Hung has also authored the book 
‘‘My Life and Many Other Short Stories’’, 
which tells his story of hardship and his path 
to success since arrival in America at the age 
of 19. The book has inspired many youths. 
With his passionate, tremendous dedication, 
hardworking, and extraordinary leadership, Dr. 
Anthony Cao Minh Hung has made great im-
pacts in the Vietnamese American community. 
He is known among his peers and members 
as a great leader in many aspects, particularly 
on preserving the Vietnamese American herit-
age and building leadership in the younger 
generation.

RECOGNIZING 
ANGOLA’S 
AMBAS-
SADOR TO THE U.S., JOAQUIM DO 
ESPIRITO SANTO, FOR HIS VISIT 
TO ATLANTA 
HON. NIKEMA WILLIAMS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I want to thank Angola’s Ambassador to 
the United States, Joaquim do Espirito Santo, 
for coming to the City of Atlanta to celebrate 
our native son, Reverend Martin Luther King, 
Jr. 
Angolans arrived in the American South 400 
years ago as the first African slaves brought to 
the colonies that would become the United 
States. Atlanta was incorporated in 1845, and 
by 1850, Atlanta’s population was roughly 20 
percent African slaves, mostly from Western 
Africa and what is now Angola. Angola and 
the City of Atlanta have a long shared history, 
and Ambassador Joaquim do Espirito Santo’s 
recent visit honors the relationship between 
Angola and Atlanta. 
While in Atlanta, Ambassador Joaquim do 
Espirito Santo joined the Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Day service alongside me at Ebenezer 
Baptist Church, one of the most powerful mod-
ern institutions of the Civil Rights movement. 
A guest of Dr. Bernice King, Ambassador 
Joaquim do Espirito Santo attended the serv-
ice on behalf of Angolan President Joa˜o 
Lourenc¸o, 
While in town, Ambassador Espirito Santo 
further built ties with Atlanta’s thriving busi-
nesses and organizations. By meeting with At-
lanta’s Mayor, City Council, the Metro Atlanta 
Chamber of Commerce, and the Georgia De-
partment of Economic Development, Ambas-
sador Espirito Santo has laid the groundwork 
for continued cooperation and partnership be-
tween Atlanta and Angola. Similarly, the Am-
bassador met with the Atlanta-based Carter 
Center to thank them for their excellent work 
eliminating Guinea Worm Disease in Angola. 
Recognizing Atlanta’s shared past and excit-
ing future with Angola, the Atlanta City Council 
officially proclaimed January 17, MLK Day, as 
‘‘Angola Day’’ in Atlanta. In the words of the 
City Council, ‘‘this growing partnership be-
tween Atlanta and Angola is a story that has 
come nearly full circle, from tragedy and injus-
tice to opportunity and hope.’’ 
I join the City of Atlanta in congratulating the 
Ambassador on his timely visit and look for-
ward to the blossoming cultural and economic 
relationship between Atlanta and Angola. 
HONORING U.S. PARALYMPIAN 
OKSANA MASTERS 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of my constituent, Oksana 
Masters, who is now the most decorated U.S. 
Winter Paralympian of all time. 
Born in Ukraine in the wake of the 
Chernobyl disaster, Ms. Masters faced chal-
lenges early on in life due to the serious im-
pacts of radiation exposure. But, like most 
things in her life, she overcame these obsta-
cles with unyielding courage. Knowing the se-
rious medical attention that would be needed, 
Ms. Masters was placed up for adoption and 
spent the first seven and a half years of her 
life in orphanages. After being adopted, Ms. 
Masters’ family moved to Louisville when she 
was 13 years old, where she excelled in 
sports and graduated from my alma mater, 
Atherton High School. During her impressive 
career, Ms. Masters has established herself as 
a world-class athlete who continues to inspire 
young people in Louisville and beyond to pur-
sue their dreams in the face of adversity. 
With a gold medal in the cross-country ski-
ing 
mixed 
relay 
at 
the 
2022 
Beijing 
Paralympics, Ms. Masters now holds 14 Win-
ter Paralympic medals in cross country skiing 
and biathlon, along with three more Summer 
Paralympic medals in cycling and rowing. In 
addition to her athletic accomplishments, Ms. 
Masters is an outspoken activist on behalf of 
her home country, where she advocates to im-
prove medical services for children with dis-
abilities in Ukraine. 
On behalf of the people of Kentucky’s Third 
Congressional District and the city of Louis-
ville, I thank Ms. Masters, for her leadership 
and for representing the United States with 
such distinction. She is an incredible role 
model both on and off the slopes, and I have 
no doubt that she will continue to be a source 
of pride for her friends and family, the people 
of Louisville and our entire nation.

OF 
HIROSHI 
MIYAMURA 
FOR 
NATIONAL 
MEDAL OF HONOR DAY 2022 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor Hiroshi H. ‘‘Hershey’’ 
Miyamura of Gallup, New Mexico for his in-
credible life of service to our nation and in 
honor of tomorrow’s National Medal of Honor 
Day. 
At a time when Japanese Americans faced 
widespread persecution, Mr. Miyamura bravely 
volunteered to serve in the 100th Infantry Bat-
talion, 442nd Infantry Regiment, during World 
War II. 
Mr. Miyamura answered the call to service 
again during the Korean War and proved him-
self to be a model of leadership as a Corporal 
in Company H, 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry 
Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. 
On the night of April 24, 1951, Company H 
was ambushed by enemy forces. Aware of the 
imminent danger to him and his men, Mr. 
Miyamura ordered the squad to fall back while 
he remained to cover their movement. 
Courageously fighting off more than 50 
enemy combatants by himself, Mr. Miyamura 
gave his squad enough time to escape and 
was captured as a Prisoner of War (POW). 
As a POW, Mr. Miyamura was forced to 
march 300 miles over five weeks. He then en-
dured 28 months in a POW camp with little 
food or water. 
Following his release in 1953, Mr. Miyamura 
was presented with the Congressional Medal 
of Honor by President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
for his tremendous display of fortitude and 
heroism. 
Since his discharge from the military serv-
ice, Mr. Miyamura remains a staunch advo-
cate for his fellow veterans and his commu-
nity. 
I’m proud to serve Mr. Miyamura in Con-
gress and recognize him for his invaluable 
service, both as a wartime hero and peace-
time mentor, to the State of New Mexico and 
to the United States of America.

HONORING 
VIVIAN 
RODRIGUEZ 
FOR HER LIFELONG CAREER IN 
PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, as Outreach 
Director for Florida’s 9th Congressional Dis-
trict, Vivian Rodriguez served as a Federal li-
aison to Central Florida constituents and com-
munity leaders. Her dedication to underserved 
communities helped to elevate their voices 
and concerns. During her tenure, Ms. Rodri-
guez organized hundreds of outreach meet-
ings and community events. She proudly rec-
ognized community leaders who selflessly 
gave their time to benefit Central Florida at 
multiple cultural events each year. 
Ms. Rodriguez worked to support our of-
fice’s belief in combatting social injustice by 
organizing advisory committee panels to iden-
tify areas within our community that needed 
improvement from criminal justice, Hispanic, 
and LGBTQ+ priorities. Following the devasta-
tion from Hurricane Maria, Ms. Rodriguez 
united community leaders to help thousands of 
people transition into our Central Florida com-
munity from Puerto Rico. 
One of Ms. Rodriguez’s greatest accom-
plishments was working with the LGBTQ+ 
community to designate Pulse as a National 
Memorial. Her efforts will honor the victims’ 
families, survivors, and Central Florida com-
munity forever. She also drafted letters of sup-
port to increase our community’s resources 
during the global health pandemic. Her actions 
helped boost our community vaccination num-
bers and improve COVID–19 testing avail-
ability. 
Today, we celebrate her lifelong career in 
public service, which began at the New York 
City Police Department where she was com-
mitted to protecting her community, especially 
following the 9/11 attack. She later worked as 
a consultant to the Department of Homeland 
Security before serving Central Florida as Out-
reach Director for Florida’s 9th Congressional 
District. We are grateful for Vivian’s commit-
ment to serving our community and wish her 
the best in her retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE H.E.A.R.T.S. MU-
SEUM AND THEIR EFFORTS TO 
PRESERVE VETERAN MEMORIES 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
congratulate the H.E.A.R.T.S. Veterans Mu-
seum in Huntsville, Texas, as it dedicates its 
replica of the Vietnam Wall Memorial. This 
wall is a powerful and emotional reminder of 
our fallen soldiers who made the ultimate sac-
rifice valiantly defending human life and free-
dom in the Vietnam War. 
The H.E.A.R.T.S. Veterans Museum rep-
resents a three-decade commemorative com-
munity effort born from a humble window front 
display. Who knew that a single patriotic ges-
ture would result in a permanent museum pre-
serving the names and memories of the men 
and women who did not make it home from 
the battlefields of Vietnam. 
The museum began as a traveling student 
education 
program, 
but 
the 
mission 
of 
H.E.A.R.T.S. quickly brought the community 
together. The permanent location in Huntsville 
opened its doors on Veteran’s Day in 2009. 
Spurred by one respectful and reflective ges-
ture, this effort by the Huntsville community 
truly exemplifies the H.E.A.R.T.S. mission to 
Help Every American Remember Through 
Serving. 
Today, the H.E.A.R.T.S. Veterans Museum 
is a living time capsule that showcases, sa-
lutes, and immortalizes our nation’s heroes 
and their contributions. Veterans are the heart-
beat of freedom, and this addition will serve as 
a powerful reminder that our freedom is not 
free. 
I am proud to congratulate the H.E.A.R.T.S. 
museum on the completion of their replica of 
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Wash-
ington, D.C. This 370-foot-long, eight-foot-tall 
replica serves to honor our veterans who 
stepped up to the call of duty and gave their 
lives for the sake of liberty and justice for all. 
Their names, forever carved in stone, rep-
resent a small token of our gratitude and deep 
appreciation for their sacrifice. Families and 
veterans from across Texas and neighboring 
states can visit this wall to honor the 
2,700,000 men and women who served in the 
Vietnam War. 
I am proud to join my community to recog-
nize the dedication of this deeply moving me-
morial and congratulate the H.E.A.R.T.S. Vet-
erans Museum on all the work they have done 
to honor the brave service members, living 
and deceased, who fought in the Vietnam 
War.

REMEMBERING DR. DONALD 
PINKEL 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay a respectful tribute to Dr. Donald P. 
Pinkel, a pediatric oncologist whose aggres-
sive treatment of childhood cancer at St. Jude 
Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, and 
elsewhere, has saved thousands of lives. Dr. 
Pinkel died last week in California at the age 
of 95. Already an established childhood can-
cer specialist in his native Buffalo, Dr. Pinkel 
was lured to St. Jude in 1961 by its founder, 
Danny Thomas, before the physical structure 
had been built. He was instrumental in its de-
velopment and staffing as its first chief execu-
tive and medical director. In segregated Mem-
phis, he insisted that all facets of St. Jude be 
integrated and that the malnutrition of his pa-
tients, many of them Black, be addressed by 
a nutritional assistance program that became 
the model for the federal government’s Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants and Children, known as W.I.C. With 
other top researchers, he developed chemo-
therapy protocols for treating almost always 
fatal acute lymphocytic leukemia that were 
considered radical and dangerous, but which 
proved over time to transform the illness into 
a treatable disease which now has a 94 per-
cent five-year survival rate. As Danny Thomas’ 
daughter Marlo said in a statement last week, 
her father and Dr. Pinkel ‘‘had the same 
unyielding hope and were equally audacious 
in their determination that childhood leukemia 
could be vanquished.’’ Memphis and the na-
tion can be grateful this man of science de-
voted his life to saving vulnerable children. I 
send my condolences to his wife, children, 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His 
was a life well-lived.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RED 
ARROW 
SNOWMOBILE-ATV CLUB RECEIV-
ING 
NATIONAL 
SNOWMOBILE 
CLUB OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the Red Arrow Snowmobile- 
ATV Club for receiving the prestigious Na-
tional Snowmobile Club of the Year award. 
Since 1968, the Red Arrow Snowmobile 
Club has served as a place for its members to 
gather and enjoy the more than 60 miles of 
trails that it maintains. Over the years, the Red 
Arrow Snowmobile-ATV Club has grown to 
have over 500 members, from Wisconsin, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, and even Ten-
nessee. Throughout the years, the hard work 
and dedication of past and present board 
leaders, members, and community volunteers 
has resulted in Red Arrow being honored by 
the American Council of Snowmobile Associa-
tions as the 2021 Snowmobile Club of the 
Year. I commend the close relationship be-
tween the Club and the Townsend Community 
that has contributed to their overwhelming and 
lasting success. 
In the Red Arrow Snowmobile-ATV Club, 
each member plays a vital role in its success. 
Specifically, the dedicated maintenance crews 
that spend multiple hours and late nights to 
ensure that their trails are of the highest qual-
ity. This crew enables individuals to travel 
across the State of Wisconsin and into Town-
send, where they enjoy local restaurants, mo-
tels, and gas stations, resulting in a flourishing 
economy. The Club has shown that they will 
continue to live by the idea of keeping the 
club’s future success as a top priority. The 
Red Arrow Club has consistently shown its 
commitment to not only to the snowmobiling 
community but to the Townsend Community. 
The Red Arrow Snowmobile-ATV Club is a 
true credit to Northeast Wisconsin. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating the Red Arrow Snowmobile Club 
for being recognized as the 2021 Snowmobile 
Club of the Year. The Red Arrow Snowmobile 
Club is an outstanding organization and is de-
serving of the highest degree of recognition.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF BERNICE FERNANDES 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to wish a very happy birthday to Bernice 
Jerves Fernandes, upon turning 100 years of 
age on March 25, 2022. She was born on the 
island of Kauai before Hawaii was admitted to 
the Union. She has made a wonderful dif-
ference in many lives, including serving as a 
teacher for 26 years at Holy Cross parish 
school, and hosting many foster children. Yet 
she has made time to also become a success-
ful businesswoman and farm owner. Her late 
husband, Frank Fernandes, served the cause 
of freedom in World War II. Bernice is a long-
time friend, and her daughter Bernadine has 
been my close friend since childhood. Bernice 
has five grandchildren and 18 great grand-
children. 
I want to congratulate Bernice on this mile-
stone and assure her of my love and appre-
ciation. Her 100th birthday deserves our honor 
and acclaim, as it represents a wise lifetime of 
being a joy to those of us who know her and 
making the world a better place. The Scripture 
places great blessing upon a long life that is 
‘‘full of days,’’ and emphasizes deep respect 
to age as a ‘‘crown of glory.’’ I trust Bernice 
feels the special affection from her many loved 
ones, and congratulations all to her family and 
friends as they celebrate Bernice where she 
lives in Hawaii. I thank Bernice and Soifua.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the inauguration of Dr. 
Anne Prisco as the sixth president of Holy 
Family University. After achieving a bachelor’s 
degree from the University of Arizona, a mas-
ter’s degree from Fordham University, and a 
Ph.D. from Columbia University, Dr. Prisco 
has gone on to faithfully serve a number of 
higher education institutions in a variety of 
roles. Over the course of her impressive ca-
reer, she has worked as an administrator, fac-
ulty member, researcher, and consultant. Prior 
to her new post at Holy Family. Dr. Prisco was 
President of Felician University in New Jersey 
from 2012 to 2020, leading the school through 
a transformational period. Under her leader-
ship there, the university grew and is now 
thriving with record-breaking increases in en-
rollment, growing net revenue, continued facili-
ties enhancements, and a focus on inclusive 
excellence and shared governance. Dr. Prisco 
was appointed as the next President of Holy 
Family University in July 2021 and will be offi-
cially installed in that on April 8, 2022. We 
have no doubt that she will bring the same 
commitment that she brought to her previous 
academic posts to Holy Family University. As 
Dr. Prisco fully begins this new journey, we 
are incredibly grateful for the positive impact 
that she has already had community and wish 
her well in her new role.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
DANIELLE 
BISHOP WHO IS ASSUMING RE-
SPONSIBILITY AS THE COMMAND 
SERGEANT MAJOR OF THE U.S. 
ARMY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
DIVISION 
HON. BRYAN STEIL 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Danielle Bishop, a Burlington, 
Wisconsin, native serving our nation in the 
United States Army. Danielle enlisted in the 
United States Army after graduating from Bur-
lington High School in 2001. Since joining the 
Armed Forces, she has served our nation 
proudly for over 20 years. 
Danielle began her career of service as a 
military police officer, protecting her fellow sol-
diers. She joined the United States Army 
Criminal Investigation Division in 2007, where 
she furthered her experience and expertise in 
both law enforcement and military service. 
When Danielle first joined the Army, she 
was unsure where her career path would lead. 
But she found something she excelled at, 
where she could serve and protect the country 
while doing the same for her fellow soldiers. 
Danielle has devoted her life to service for 
over two decades. Now, she will assume re-
sponsibility as the Command Sergeant Major 
of the United States Army Criminal Investiga-
tion Division. This is a tremendous honor, and 
one which demonstrates Danielle’s accom-
plishments and dedication. 
On, March 25, 2022, Danielle will be hon-
ored at Quantico for her outstanding achieve-
ments and commitment to service. On behalf 
of Wisconsin’s First Congressional District, I 
want to thank Danielle for her leadership and 
service to our nation. We are safer because of 
Danielle’s service.

HONORING GORDON C. BAXTER 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor Gordon C. Baxter, a World War II Vet-
eran and Career Fireman of Geneva, New 
York. Gordon passed away on March 17, 
2022, at the age of 95, and it is only fitting 
that today we remember him for his enduring 
dedication to his country and community. 
Gordon was a lifelong resident of Geneva, 
New York. He graduated from Geneva High 
School in 1944 and joined the Army on May 
1, 1944. In August of 1945, Gordon was as-
signed to the Philippine Islands and returned 
to the United States in January of 1946. Gor-
don was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, 
Asiatic Pacific Theater Ribbon, and World War 
II Victory Ribbon in recognition of his service 
to our country. He was Honorably Discharged 
in May of 1946 and went on to study at the 
Rochester Institute of Technology for two 
years. 
Gordon’s commitment to the community was 
an inspiration. He worked for the City of Gene-
va as a Career Fireman from which he retired 
after 25 years of dedicated service. Gordon 
was a proud member of the Hydrant Hose 
Company Number 1, where he held several 
offices over his tenure. He was also a member 
of the American Legion Post 396 and the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars. 
Above all, Gordon was a family man. I have 
always been inspired by the hard work and 
kindness of the Baxter family and I appreciate 
Gordon’s service to our country and to our 
community. He will always be remembered, as 
his legacy will live on forever through his fam-
ily and friends. 
Given the above, I ask that this legislative 
body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
honor Gordon C. Baxter for his lifelong com-
mitment to service.

Mr.

Madam 
Speaker, 
today l congratulate the Washington High

tunity, and I could not be prouder to represent 
them. Missouri is lucky to be represented by 
the WHS Choir. 
COMMEMORATING THE 200TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF KEY WEST 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Key 
West, Florida. The island’s rich history and 
culture has made it an exquisite destination for 
millions around the world and in our great na-
tion. Throughout the last 200 years, Key West 
has remained resilient and has always taken 
pride in its early entrepreneurship, labor force, 
and culture. 
What is now Key West was originally incor-
porated as Thompson’s Island. Early on, Key 
West was designated a Port of Entry. Within 
a few years, it transformed into an active city, 
attracting merchants, shipbuilders, politicians, 
and others from all over that were in pursuit of 
success. In the 1830s the wrecking industry 
expanded and became the main trade for the 
island. 
During the mid-nineteenth century migration 
on the island also increased. Many Bahamians 
relocated to Key West and specialized in ship-
building, fishing, sponging, and other maritime 
industries that were expanding at the time. 
Due to the expansion of these industries, Key 
West’s success remained steadfast. 
Today, the island is known for its biodiver-
sity, historic sites, beaches, tourism, and rich 
culture. l commemorate the contributions 
many over the course of the last two centuries 
have made to propel and expand Key West. 
Exploration, entrepreneurship, and hard work 
have allowed the island to be what it is 
today—a unique treasure in our state. 
It is an honor to join the South Florida and 
Conch community in celebrating this grand 
milestone. Key West has played a significant 
role in our nation’s history and continues to 
exemplify the best of our great state today. 
Happy 200th anniversary Key West. Congratu-
lations to all of those who have contributed to 
our island and have made it what it is today.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF HILTON GUAM RESORT 
& SPA 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Hilton Guam Resort & 
Spa as they celebrate their 50th anniversary. 
I extend my sincere congratulations for their 
decades of outstanding service and commend 
them for their contributions as a leader in 
Guam’s tourism industry. 
Having opened its doors in February of 
1972, Hilton Guam Resort & Spa was the first 
international 5-star hotel that arrived on our 
shores. As a pioneering force in the island’s 
tourism history, the Guam Hilton meaningfully 
elevated the industry and catalyzed its emer-
gence as one of this day’s leading economic 
drivers. The growth they have accomplished 
over the years has directly improved the qual-
ity of life for the people of Guam, providing 
thousands of job opportunities, significantly re-
ducing resident household taxes, and facili-
tating greater connections with a diverse glob-
al population. The hotel group has further 
demonstrated their steadfast commitment to 
our community with stay offerings and employ-
ment prospects uniquely available to residents 
amid the challenges of the ongoing COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Now a major tourist destination and melting 
pot of cultures, Guam proudly shares our Ha˚fa 
Adai spirit and island hospitality with visitors 
from Japan, Korea, and other countries across 
the world. Madam Speaker, I express my 
deepest gratitude to the Hilton Guam Resort & 
Spa for their dedication to supporting the local 
public while fostering the island’s relationships 
with international communities. Once again, I 
would like to congratulate them for over five 
decades of excellence in service, and may the 
future ahead be filled with continued success 
for both the Guam Hilton and our island as a 
whole.

IN HONOR OF HARINI KRISHNAN 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Harini Krishnan who is being 
honored as the 2020 Hillsborough Schools’ 
Citizen of the Year. Every year, the Associ-
ated Parents’ Group of Hillsborough selects an 
individual who has made sustained and signifi-
cant contributions to the Hillsborough commu-
nity, especially to education and to the well- 
being of children. I couldn’t think of a more de-
serving 
recipient 
than 
my 
friend 
Harini 
Krishnan. I have known her for many years 
and seen first-hand her tireless advocacy for 
others. With a big smile on her face, she takes 
on problems she identifies and any task hand-
ed to her. If you want to get something done, 
ask Harini. 
Somehow, she finds enough hours in the 
day to serve a long list of organizations. In ad-
dition to being a parent volunteer for the 
Hillsborough City School District, she was the 
Parent Group President at West School and 
Crocker School, served on the board of the 
Associated Parents’ Group, was the Commu-
nity Campaign Co-Chair for the Hillsborough 
Schools 
Foundation, 
co-chaired 
the 
Hillsborough Family Fun Day Carnival, and 
continues to be the Neighborhood Lead for the 
Hillsborough Neighborhood Network. Harini is 
a champion for public schools and has also 
taken a leadership role in the San Mateo High 
School parent community. She has served as 
the Co-President of the Foundation Board for 
five years, is the Mock Trial Parent Liaison, 
and is a member of Music, Drama and Dance 
Boosters. 
A resident of Hillsborough for 20 years, 
Harini is a true global citizen and applies her 
spirit and empathy to anything she does. She 
is an acclaimed Indian classical vocalist and 
lecturer. At Crocker, she taught a class on In-
dian history, culture and arts and she hosted 
Hillsborough Schools Foundation Pay-to-Play 
parties at her home where she taught people 
how to cook traditional Indian food and adorn 
saris. Her goal is not only to make people 
knowledgeable about Indian culture, but to in-
spire them to be global citizens and lifelong

learners. She believes that the best way for 
our children to have empathy and to be peo-
ple of good character is by walking in other 
people’s shoes and by exploring the world be-
yond their backyards. 
Harini also was instrumental in organizing 
the now annual trips for Crocker’s 8th graders 
to Washington, D.C. It’s a great opportunity for 
the students to learn about congressional his-
tory and to see democracy in action. 
Additionally, Harini applies her love for the 
arts to her work as vice chair of the San 
Mateo County Arts Commission and on the 
2020 California Arts Council State Local Part-
ners Grant Panel. She is a champion for so-
cial justice and gender equality and serves on 
the boards of Equal Access International and 
FUND HER. In her never-ending pursuit of 
growing and learning, she is currently enrolled 
in a program in public leadership at Harvard 
Kennedy School. As you can surmise from 
this long list of public service and engage-
ment, Harini is an exemplary community lead-
er. 
She is also a devoted wife and mother. She 
and her husband, Vika Jha, a startup entre-
preneur, have raised two remarkable children, 
Janani and Abhaya, who are college students 
pursuing their own dreams. They are talented 
and extraordinarily gifted. I have been in awe 
of their accomplishments. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in commending Harini Krishnan for her 
countless contributions to our community and 
for her determination to recruit more global 
citizens to make the world a better place.

HONORING 150 YEARS OF THE VAL-
LEY VIEW, TEXAS POST OFFICE 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, today I am 
proud to recognize the City of Valley View, 
Texas, as residents come together to cele-
brate the Valley View Post Office’s 150th birth-
day on Saturday, March 26, 2022. 
Located in Cooke County, the town was first 
settled by the Lee family in 1870. By 1872, 
L.W. Lee had plotted a beautiful new town on 
his land and named it Valley View, presum-
ably for the view offered at the site of Spring 
Valley. With the grand opening of the Valley 
View Post Office that same year, the commu-
nity would start with 18 families and prosper 
tremendously over the next 150 years. 
The community’s first school, hotel, steam 
gristmills, cotton gins, churches, and general 
stores tell an important part of Valley View’s 
history, but I believe it is the fine people of 
Valley View who represent the best aspects of 
the town. This community has reached its 
150th birthday through the generations of hard 
work and love for their community. Today, the 
United States Congress honors them. 
I am honored to represent the residents of 
Valley View here in Congress. This community 
is rich in history and its people are rooted in 
our shared Texas values. I wish them a joyous 
celebration of the past 150 years. Here’s to 
150 more. 
IN HONOR OF JACOB (JACK) 
BLANTON 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a patriotic American, Jacob (Jack) 
Blanton, on the occasion of his 102nd birth-
day. His life story exemplifies true American 
spirit, determination, and love for our country. 
Mr. Blanton was born on March 25, 1920, in 
Brooklyn, New York. His father, Silas Blanton, 
a native Kentuckian, had been serving in the 
US coastal defense in New York before WWI 
where he met a young German immigrant 
working as a nanny. They married and eventu-
ally moved their family to Kentucky when the 
burgeoning coal mines in Eastern Kentucky 
began aggressively recruiting miners. Jack 
grew up during the depression and the tumul-
tuous years of union conflict in Harlan County. 
Mr. Blanton was in high school when WWII 
broke out. He volunteered for the Army Air 
Corp to become an airplane mechanic. He 
went to school at Long Beach, CA, for Doug-
las Aircraft A–20 planes. After his training he 
was sent to Asia, where he served in the 
348th Night Fighters and also worked on 
Cargo Transport planes C54 and C47 that 
flew personnel and supplies over the Hump, 
the Himalayan Mountains. He was promoted 
to Tech Sergeant and became Crew Chief for 
the Douglas A–20. 
Following the war, Mr. Blanton married his 
high school sweetheart, who had gone to 
Washington, D.C., after high school where she 
worked for the FBI. They went on to raise four 
children in Lynch, KY where Jack was a Boy 
Scout master, Sunday School teacher at the 
Lynch Methodist Church, little league baseball 
coach, and a member of the Masonic Lodge. 
He retired from United States Steel as a mine 
foreman in 1980. He and his wife then moved 
to London, KY, to be with his elderly mother. 
He lost the love of his life to a heart attack 
three days before 9/11. 
Mr. Blanton continues to live independently 
in London where he still raises a garden and 
takes care of his home and property, even at 
102 years old. He takes tremendous pride in 
having all four of his children pursue college, 
with two earning advanced degrees. He is a 
Christian and attended Liberty Baptist Church 
in London. He is also an unabashed patriot 
with an undeterred determination to vote in the 
next Presidential election. 
It is my honor to recognize Mr. Blanton, cel-
ebrate his 102nd birthday and thank him for 
his service and sacrifice to our nation during 
World War II. As a part of The Greatest Gen-
eration, Mr. Blanton and his fellow soldiers 
fought to preserve the freedoms that we enjoy 
today, and we can never thank them enough. 
I am forever grateful for Americans like Jack 
Blanton. 
TRIBUTE TO ELIAS PARONG 
SABLAN (1899–1968) 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. 
SABLAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Elias 
Jacobo Parong Sablan was a visionary, lin-
guist, and pioneering leader of the people of 
Saipan, guiding them out from under the 400- 
year rule of foreign powers to the beginnings 
of our self-government under the trusteeship 
of the United States after World War II. 
Born on November 8, 1899, to Felix Delos 
Reyes Sablan and Luisa Malug Parong, Elias 
was the fourth child in a family of six. He 
learned our native languages at home: 
Chamorro from his father Felix and Carolinian 
from his mother Luisa. 
Felix also taught his son to speak, read, and 
write the English language. In his own youth, 
Felix served as a cabin boy aboard the 
Charles W. Morgan, an American whaling ship 
out of New Bedford, Massachusetts. From his 
crewmates he learned English and about life 
in the United States of America. He also col-
lected English textbooks on navigation, United 
States history, and other subjects, books he 
shared with his son Elias as the boy grew. 
The year before Elias’ birth, Germany pur-
chased the Northern Mariana Islands from 
Spain, which had ruled the islands for some 
377 years. Elias attended the German school 
on Saipan, and then was sent to the island of 
Yap, also under German control, to be edu-
cated in communications. By the time he was 
15, Elias had learned the international Morse 
code and added Yapese and German to his 
linguistic skills. 
Japan seized control of the Northern Mar-
iana Islands from Germany at the outset of 
World War I and after the war was granted a 
mandate to govern by the League of Nations. 
This occupation provided Elias the opportunity 
to learn one more language, Japanese, while 
working at the Japanese sugar mill. He also 
married during this Japanese period, wedding 
Carmen Romolor Mangarero on January 23, 
1921. Together they would have 13 children. 
Elias’ heritage, his upbringing, his edu-
cation, and experience all prepared him well 
for the life-threatening events of World War II 
and what came after. In fact, Elias’ knowledge 
of English would save his life and the lives of 
his family. 
World War II came to the Mariana Islands 
on June 10, 1944, when the United States at-
tacked the Japanese military forces on 
Saipan. After a brutal and destructive battle, 
killing tens of thousands of Japanese and 
American soldiers, as well as non-combatant 
civilians, the United States took control of the 
island on July 9, 1944. 
Throughout the battle, Elias and his family 
hid in a cave in the hills, listening as bombs 
dropped on the island and watching as Japa-
nese and American airplanes fought in the 
skies overhead. One day, spotting movement 
near the cave’s entrance, U.S. battleships just 
outside the island’s reef aimed their fire at the 
family’s hiding place. 
When the shelling subsided, those sheltered 
in the cave could hear voices outside speak-
ing a foreign language. It was U.S. Marines 
talking in English and combing the area for

Japanese. Suddenly, a baby started crying 
within the cave and the entrance was discov-
ered. The Marines yelled into the cave, and 
Elias immediately came out with his hands up 
and said in English, I surrender. If he had not 
responded as he did, the Marines were ready 
to toss grenades into the cave rather than risk 
Japanese soldiers were hiding there. 
Because he spoke English, the Marines 
asked if he was Elias Sablan. They had been 
on the look-out for him because they were told 
Elias was one of only two Chamorros who 
knew English and could help translate for the 
U.S. military forces. Everyone in the cave was 
escorted down the hill to the camp where 
other survivors had been gathered and were 
being fed, clothed, and treated for injuries. 
When the battles in the Marianas had 
ended, the American Military Government 
wanted to put the islanders on the road to 
independence and self-government. In De-
cember 1944, they held the first election for a 
Head Chief, the forerunner of today’s Mayor. 
Barely five months into office, however, that 
first elected official passed away. 
The military then appointed Elias to be in-
terim Head Chief, until a new election could 
be held. Elias was working as the leader of 
the police force and continued in that position 
until being elected in his own right at head 
chief/mayor on July 4, 1945. Women voted in 
that July election, although they had not been 
able to vote the previous December. 
Elias was an excellent representative of his 
constituents. He embodied Saipan’s history 
and culture, because by blood he was both 
Chamorro and Carolinian, the two local com-
munities of the island. He spoke those two 
languages, as well as the languages of all the 
foreign powers that had ruled and were now 
ruling Saipan: Spanish, German, Japanese, 
and English. Bringing this background and lin-
guistic ability to his work as Mayor, Elias could 
understand and be understood by everyone 
on Saipan. 
In coordination with the U.S. military the 
new Mayor went about the business of bring-
ing life on the island back to normalcy. He ap-
pointed a building supervisor, a sanitation 
commissioner, an Educational Officer, and a 
replacement Police Chief. The infrastructure 
for the new island government was now start-
ed. 
Every person living in the camps set up 
after the battle of Saipan was identified and 
accounted for. Repairs were made to the 
classrooms of the Chalan Kanoa school, so 
children could have a place to study. And 
working with the U.S. military, Elias helped in-
terested families return to work farming. 
In 1947, the United Nations created the 
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The 
United States was charged with governing the 
TTPI and with helping its people transition 
from being colonies to being sovereign na-
tions. As Mayor, Elias worked with the TTPI 
administration. He even traveled to New York 
City in 1955, along with delegates from the 
other Micronesian islands in the Trust Territory 
to report on the status of that transition. 
Elias wanted to model self-government in 
the islands after American democracy, which 
he had read about in the textbooks his father 
gave him. There had been no political parties, 
when he was first elected, and no specific 
candidates. Each voter simply wrote in the 
name of his or her choice on a printed ballot. 
So, to foster competitive elections after the 
American practice, Elias, together with other 
community leaders, started the islands’ first 
political party: the Territorial Party. 
Elias served for three consecutive terms 
(twelve years) as the Mayor of Saipan, from 
1945 through 1956. Even after stepping down 
as Mayor, though, he continued serving the 
people in various other government and civic 
positions until his death on October 29, 1968. 
Sadly, his passing came too soon for him to 
witness the realization of his vision of a happy 
and prosperous life for his people as members 
of the American political family. Saipan and 
the other Northern Mariana Islands became a 
Commonwealth of the United States in 1978.

HONORING JJ GERTLER FOR HIS 
PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I wish to honor the achievements of Jeremiah 
‘‘JJ’’ Gertler, Specialist in Military Aviation, 
Congressional Research Service, on the occa-
sion of his retirement from the Service on Feb-
ruary 28, 2022. 
JJ Gertler served Congress with distinction 
for more than 22 years at the Library of Con-
gress as a Specialist in Military Aviation for 
the Congressional Research Service, as a 
professional staff member of the House Armed 
Services Committee, and as a Defense Legis-
lative Assistant for then-Senator Chuck Robb 
of Virginia. He earned a bachelor’s degree 
from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachu-
setts, a master’s degree in international secu-
rity policy from the Elliott School of Inter-
national Affairs at the George Washington Uni-
versity in Washington, D.C., as well as grad-
uating with distinction from the U.S. Naval War 
College in Newport, Rhode Island. 
JJ is recognized throughout Congress, the 
military Services, the defense community, and 
the military aviation community as an expert in 
U.S. military aviation programs, capabilities, 
and strategy. He authored numerous reports 
and products pertaining to important military 
aircraft programs across the military services, 
ranging from the F–35 fighter to the Marine 
Corps Osprey to privatized adversary air com-
bat training. He also is an expert in the stra-
tegic use of military aviation, writing exten-
sively on no-fly zones, possible air strikes in 
numerous conflicts, and on the strategic impli-
cations of the Air Force’s long-term budget pri-
orities. He excelled at consultative work for 
Members of Congress and staffers, developing 
and maintaining long-term relationships with 
offices and committees of jurisdiction. 
JJ also exercised true leadership at CRS. 
He was chosen, based on his outstanding 
skills as an analyst and public speaker, to 
moderate numerous high-profile panels orga-
nized by the Service, most notably the plenary 
session for the 2019 New Members’ Seminar 
in Williamsburg, Virginia. His skills at presen-
tation are well noted by both members and 
peers, and a House Armed Services sub-
committee chairman once told him, ‘‘I have 
been here 10 years, and I have never heard 
a better presentation.’’ He created the first 
podcast for CRS aimed at Congressional cli-
ents, served a year in a rotation as a Senior 
Advisor to the Director of CRS, and piloted 
multiple new written CRS products during his 
tenure. 
During his tenure as a professional staff 
member on the House Armed Services Com-
mittee from 2000 through 2004, Mr. Gertler 
oversaw the defense procurement and missile 
defense budgets, including all classified pro-
grams, during the Fiscal Year 2000 through 
2005 budgets. Prior to serving on the com-
mittee, he was a defense legislative assistant 
from 1990 to 1995 for Senator Robb who was 
simultaneously serving on the Armed Serv-
ices, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence com-
mittees. 
JJ Gertler, in addition to his tremendous 
work and professionalism, is notable for his 
love of automobiles and his sense of humor. 
While working on Senator Robb’s staff, JJ’s 
sports car team finished third in the country. 
He plans to retire to the Maryland shore and 
continue those pursuits. On behalf of the 
House Armed Services Committee and all 
those who JJ has worked with during his 22 
years on Capitol Hill, we thank him for his 
public service and wish him well.

RECOGNIZING THE 200TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
BIRTH 
OF 
FRANCIS VINCENT 
HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER 
OF DELAWARE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speak-
er, I include in the RECORD this article in rec-
ognition of the 200th anniversary of the birth 
of Francis Vincent. 
[From the Delaware Genealogical Society, 
May 2021] 
FRANCIS VINCENT: EDITOR, PUBLIC SERVANT 
(By Mary Anne Vincent) 
March 17, 2022 will be the 200th anniversary 
of the birth of one or Delaware’s most illus-
trious citizens, Francis Vincent. 
Francis Vincent was only 23 when he co- 
founded the Blue Hen’s Chicken, a newspaper 
which would greatly influence events in 
Delaware and Maryland within the next few 
years. Local papers in his day borrowed 
heavily from large city paper but they print-
ed little news about either Wilmington or 
Delaware. Vincent, who knew the state from 
end to end, devoted most of his paper to 
state and local news. Within three months 
his paper had the largest circulation in the 
state. 
Vincent used the Blue Hen’s Chicken to ad-
vocate for major changes in his home state. 
He called for proportional representation in 
the state legislature, ratification of more 
important laws by popular ballot, and elec-
tion of state officers instead of their appoint-
ment by the governor. 
Politicians, especially Whigs who con-
trolled the state government, were sharply 
opposed to such changed. Vincent persist-
ently called for a state convention to change 
the state constitution. Other newspapers fol-
lowed his lead by addressing the same issue. 
In 1846, the Whigs were turned out of office. 
In 1848, Vincent published an article on the 
‘‘Moral Effects of Hanging’’. Shortly there-
after, the state legislature abolished public 
hangings. He also called for abolishing public 
whipping of women. Known to his contem-
poraries as a courteous, gentle man, this 
treatment of women was abhorrent to him. 
Vincent showed his concern for other seg-
ments of society by calling for a 10-hour

work day (an act of courage in those days), 
the exemption of a portion of a citizen’s 
goods from forcd seizure for debt, the estab-
lishment of life-saving service and coastal 
patrol on the Delaware River, and free uni-
versal education. All of these proposals were 
adopted. Indeed, the school system of Wil-
mington at the time of his death in 1884 was 
substantially what he proposed in 1850. 
After the Civil War, Vincent gained fame 
for his ‘‘Essay Recommending the Union of 
Great Britain and her Colonies and the 
United States and the Final Union of the 
World into One Great Nation’’. He explored 
the topic further in a subsequent essay ad-
dressed to the International and Permanent 
League of Peace in December 1869. His plan, 
which ante-dated Wilson’s League of Nations 
by almost five decades, never came to fru-
ition.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF MIKE 
BUCKLES 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to my friend Mike 
Buckles upon his retirement from the Daniel 
Boone Community Action Agency, where he 
has served as Executive Director for nearly 25 
years. 
Mike has dedicated his career to assisting 
individuals and families most-in-need. He 
turned an agency facing financial hardships 
into a thriving, successful resource to combat 
poverty. Mike is a visionary leader, always 
working to expand services to help as many 
people as possible in Clay, Jackson and Lee 
counties. As Executive Director, he increased 
employment from 40 to 135 employees, added 
two certified Kentucky Career Centers and in-
creased the budget to over $16 million. 
He worked diligently to lift the Daniel Boone 
CAA out of debt and increased programs for 
transportation, weatherization, low-income en-
ergy assistance, workforce development, child 
care, housing and emergency services. 
As a result of his achievements, Mike was 
selected to lead Community Action Kentucky 
as President for two terms. In 2015, he was 
inducted into the Transportation Hall of Fame 
and he received the ‘‘Jesse Amburgey Award 
of Excellence in Community Action’’ in 2019. 
In 2020, he was named a ‘‘SOAR Hero’’ by 
the non-profit SOAR organization—Shaping 
Our Appalachian Region. Under his leader-
ship, Daniel Boone CAA has also earned 
many accolades, including the Statewide 
Transportation Award, Eastern Kentucky Sec-
tion 531 Award, Vehicle Maintenance Award, 
Statewide Transportation Award, and the 
Weatherization Leadership Award, among oth-
ers. 
Thanks to Mike’s lifetime of perseverance 
and due diligence, countless families in our 
rural region have received assistance when 
they needed it the most—getting a ride to the 
doctor’s office, getting the training necessary 
for a new job, keeping warm in the winter, ac-
cessing childcare during work hours, and 
much more. Without a doubt, Mike Buckles 
has made a resounding difference in south-
eastern Kentucky and I appreciate his sincere 
friendship and partnership over the years. I 
wish Mike a happy and peaceful retirement 
with his wife Sharon and their beautiful family. 
ORDER OF THE ARROW 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Boy Scouts of 
America, Order of the Arrow program. 
The Order of the Arrow was founded on the 
highest ideals of the Boy Scouts of America 
as Scouting’s national camping honor society. 
It recognizes Scouts who best exemplify the 
Scout Oath and Law in their daily lives. 
Members of the Order of the Arrow are 
known for maintaining camping traditions and 
spirit, promoting year-round outdoor activities, 
and providing cheerful service to others. 
Each spring, the eleven Order of the Arrow 
Lodges in Georgia and Alabama come to-
gether for an annual conclave. The 2022 Con-
clave will be hosted at Camp Benjamin Haw-
kins in Byron, Georgia on the weekend of April 
1. 
The weekend, steeped in tradition, will in-
clude fun, fellowship, and service. I extend my 
best wishes to the Scouts and Advisors par-
ticipating in this Conclave, and I hope their ex-
perience will be memorable and enjoyable.

RECOGNIZING CARL PIERSON 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and honor Carl Pierson, a hus-
band, father, teacher, coach, City Council 
member, and resident of Minnesota’s Sixth 
Congressional District. Carl has served the 
City of Waconia for more than twenty years, 
enriching the lives of countless students and 
community members around him. He leads by 
example, and we are fortunate to have some-
one like Carl in the Sixth District who puts oth-
ers first and demonstrates what ‘‘Selfless 
Service’’ truly means. 
Carl is a staple in the Waconia Community, 
teaching high school government for the last 
two decades. In addition to educating future 
generations of Minnesotans in the classroom, 
he is cultivating the next generation of stu-
dent-athletes as coach of the Waconia High 
School basketball, baseball, and football 
teams. If that weren’t enough, Carl is the Ex-
ecutive Director of the Minnesota Girls Basket-
ball Coaches Association and author of the 
book ‘‘The Politics of Coaching,’’ a must-read 
for coaches looking to navigate the politics of 
youth sports. As someone who coached youth 
hockey for many years, I’ve learned some val-
uable lessons in negotiation and diplomacy 
while working with the parents of my players, 
but Carl literally wrote the book on it. 
In November 2020, Carl was elected to the 
Waconia City Council, representing Ward 2. 
This was not his first stint in public service, as 
Carl had previously served on the Waconia 
Park Board and the Carver County Sheriffs 
Citizen Advisory Council. Where Carl finds 
time to accomplish all these things and con-
tinue to be a loving husband to his wife and 
father to his two sons remains a mystery, 
however, Carl remains a leader and mentor 
for the residents and students in Waconia. 
Earlier this year, Carl was diagnosed with 
an aggressive form of cancer. While this news 
is never easy to receive, I have no doubt that 
he will approach this new challenge with the 
same optimism and determination be has 
shown time and time again on the basketball 
court and win this fight. 
I cannot thank Carl enough for his leader-
ship and dedication to the residents of 
Waconia. Our community, our district, and our 
state are in a better place because of his work 
and perseverance. I thank Carl, and may God 
Bless him and his wonderful family.

THE 
DIVISION 
I 
WRESTLING 
STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
wrestler in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Marcus Blaze, a freshman at Perrysburg High 
School, has represented his school ably on his 
way to achieving the Division I State Wrestling 
Title. Marcus overcame the challenges posed 
by intense competition in his effort to win the 
Division I State Wrestling Championship. 
In pursuing the State Championship, Marcus 
Blaze defeated his opponent in the finals of 
the 113-pound classification. His hard work 
and dedication, both on and off the mat, in 
achieving this accomplishment is truly out-
standing. Marcus led his team to rank second 
place overall in the championship. He has 
achieved an impressive season record bring-
ing pride to his school and community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to Marcus Blaze 
of Perrysburg High School. On behalf of the 
people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud 
to recognize this great achievement.

SUPERINTENDENT 
GLENN SCHLENDER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the distinguished career of retir-
ing Luxemburg-Casco Superintendent, Glenn 
Schlender. 
During his 37-and-a-half year career in edu-
cation, Mr. Schlender has held numerous 
leadership roles in our education system. He 
has undoubtedly made a lasting impact at 
each stop during his distinguished career. Mr. 
Schlender began his career in 1985 as a 
science teacher in the Green Bay School Dis-
trict, which was followed by taking the role of 
assistant principal at Green Bay Preble High 
School. He then joined the Pulaski School Dis-
trict as the principal at Pulaski High School for 
7 years before moving to the Palmyra-Eagle 
Area School District and assuming the role of

superintendent 
in 
2009. 
In 
2014, 
Mr. 
Schlender moved to his final stop at the Lux-
emburg-Casco School District. 
During his time at Luxemburg-Casco, Mr. 
Schlender added to his already lengthy list of 
accomplishments from his time in education. 
Mr. Schlender’s leadership and knowledge 
lead to the expansion and implementation of 
not only the physical spaces within the Luxem-
burg-Casco School District but also countless 
learning opportunities for students. Since as-
suming his role at Luxemburg-Casco, the 
school district has been recognized as a top 
10 high school academically within the Green 
Bay metro area. Mr. Schlender’s commitment 
and 
dedication 
to 
the 
Luxemburg-Casco 
school district is truly remarkable. 
In addition to academics, Ms. Schlender 
played a critical role in developing partner-
ships with community members and local busi-
nesses such as Bellin Health, D&S Machine 
Service, and the Northeast Wisconsin Manu-
facturing Alliance. These partnerships lead to 
the institution of career-readiness programs, 
including the Ahnapee Regional Youth Ap-
prenticeship Program, which has offered stu-
dents the opportunity to gain on-the-job work 
experience in the classroom. Mr. Schlender 
spent his entire career ensuring that students 
throughout Northeast Wisconsin have the re-
sources 
they 
needed 
to 
succeed. 
Mr. 
Schlender’s expertise and knowledge will 
surely be missed by his peers and the entire 
Luxemburg-Casco community. 
Mr. Schlender is leaving behind a notable 
legacy that will be admired by educators for 
years to come. After retirement, Mr. Schlender 
and his wife plan to stay in the Luxemburg- 
Casco community and I am confident that he 
will continue to be a valuable member to the 
Northeast 
Wisconsin 
community. 
Mr. 
Schlender’s distinguished career is deserving 
of the highest degree of recognition. 
IN HONOR OF THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE OPENING OF JEF-
FERSON HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 24, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate Jefferson High School in Daly City 
on the occasion of its 100th birthday. Home of 
the Jefferson Grizzlies, Jefferson High School 
has been educating children since its inception 
in 1922, staring with 50 students. Previously, 
all high school students in Daly City attended 
school in San Francisco. 
Courses offered in the original school were 
mathematics, science, English, Spanish, dra-
matics, commercial arithmetic, typing, book-
keeping, spelling, penmanship, PE for girls 
and boys, civics, vocational guidance, free 
hand drawing, and music. The original three 
teachers were Gilda Belloni, Gladys Lukes, 
and Barto Molineux. Mr. Neal O. Best was 
Chief Administrator but also taught mathe-
matics, science and boys’ athletics. 
From the start, it was evident that a perma-
nent and larger school would be needed. A 
$180,000 bond measure was approved, but 
there was disagreement about the best site for 
the new building. Some wanted it located on 
Hillside Boulevard in Edgewood Terrace, while 
others wanted it near the greyhound racing 
track at Union Coursing Park between Mission 
and Railroad Avenue. The voters settled the 
matter in March 1923. The building was built 
near the racetrack, and the first class of fresh-
men entered in 1925. 
On May 26, 1926, Jefferson High School 
graduated its first class from the new school 
site, 13 seniors. The following year, the Uni-
versity of California accredited Jefferson High 
School on July 26th, and a month later an 
alumni association was formed. A significant 
modernization of the high school occurred in 
1963 and 2017. Legendary NFL Hall of Fame 
coach and award-winning broadcaster John 
Madden, a proud Jefferson High School alum, 
contributed lights for the school’s stadium. 
From its founding to our present day, Jeffer-
son has graduated a number of other distin-
guished alums. These students include Edwin 
Mulitalo. 
Super 
Bowl 
Champion, 
Floyd 
Gonella, former district superintendent and 
San Mateo County Superintendent of Schools, 
and Justice Teri L. Jackson, currently serving 
on the California Court of Appeal. 
Jefferson High School takes pride in its di-
verse student body, and its outstanding cur-
riculum. The school meets every student 
where they are in their learning to ensure that 
all students are able to demonstrate mastery 
of essential skills and content upon gradua-
tion. AP classes are open to all students. The 
school offers a competitive robotics and engi-
neering program and dual enrollment for ca-
reer technical education is available under an 
agreement with Skyline College. Students 
graduate with both college and high school 
credits. 
In addition to its strong curriculum, Jefferson 
High School received the 2019 San Mateo 
County School Board Association Kent Award 
recognizing 
schools 
with 
innovative 
and 
replicable programs, and a 2019 Daly City 
Sustainability Award. Its community and club 
involvement are substantial. The Grizzly Go 
Club, sponsored by the local public utility, 
made portable solar power ‘‘suitcases’’ that 
were then sent to Ecuador for use in schools 
that have no electricity. Jefferson High School 
partners with Second Harvest Food Bank to 
distribute food to over 1200 families, monthly. 
Thirty clubs, including but not limited to Social 
Justice and Activism, Anime and Mock Trial, 
offer students many opportunities to become 
involved further in their school and education. 
The 11th and 12th graders are partnered with 
9th graders to ensure a smooth transition into 
the school. At the senior level, Jefferson part-
ners with the Japanese Community Youth 
Council (JCYC) to help first generation stu-
dents navigate the college entrance process. 
Madam Speaker, America is at her best 
when it offers free public education to its chil-
dren. Jefferson High School has long offered 
a high-quality education to all comers. The 
shaping of young minds through science, his-
tory, athletics and other wonderful courses of-
fered at this school builds our country as 
much as the creation of any work of public en-
gineering. America and Daly City succeed be-
cause we invest in students, invest in their 
success, and celebrate their coming of age as 
adults within our community. I thank Jefferson 
High School, and congratulate them on their 
birthday.
