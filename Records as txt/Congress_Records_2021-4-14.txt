IN RECOGNITION OF RICHARD 
BUCHANAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
former city of Bloomington council 
member, mayor, and McLean County 
board member, Mr. Richard Buchanan. 
He was a clearly dedicated public serv-
ant who dedicated more than four dec-
ades of his life to serving the tax-
payers. Sadly, Rich passed away on 
March 30. 
Rich grew up in Clinton, and grad-
uated from Northern Illinois Univer-
sity, where he met the love of his life, 
Judy. After graduation, Richard spent 
6 years serving his country in the U.S. 
Army Reserve. Outside of public serv-
ice, he had an enduring career spanning 
30 years at State Farm and raised three 
children alongside Judy. His leadership 
to Bloomington and McClean County 
will truly be missed. 
My prayers are with his wife, Judy, 
his children, and all those who called 
Richard a friend. 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF PATRICIA EVERHART 
REESE 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to remember Pa-
tricia Everhart Reese of Taylorville, a 
teacher and beloved community mem-
ber, and my friend, who passed away on 
November 3, 2020. 
Pat taught with the Taylorville 
School District for many years and was 
influential with the development of the 
Lincoln Land Literacy Program. She 
also 
spent 
time 
teaching 
at 
the 
Taylorville Correctional Center. 
Pat, of course, took on many other 
roles in the community. One, being 
mentor to me, and also, she was the 
First Lady of Taylorville for 16 years 
and the Republican County chair-
woman for 25 years, but her service 
never stopped. 
Pat leaves a lasting impact on the 
Taylorville community and will be re-
membered as a great friend to so many. 
My prayers are with her husband, 
Dan, and their entire family at this 
time. 
RECOGNIZING PATTY HORNBUCKLE 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Patty Hornbuckle for her leadership 
and service to Taylorville and Chris-
tian County, Illinois. 
I had the privilege to work with 
Patty in her role as the CEO of the 
Greater Taylorville Chamber of Com-
merce. The chamber is the driving 
force to attract new businesses, resi-
dents, and tourists in our hometown. 
During Patty’s tenure, the chamber 
experienced 
significant 
growth 
in 
membership and increase in revenue 
through fundraising and the expansion 
of the chamber’s signature event, ‘‘The 
Taylorville Chilifest.’’ 
Patty is certainly going to be missed. 
While we will miss her, her leadership 
has set up the chamber to continue its 
successful service to our community 
for years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to send my 
heartfelt congrats to my friend, Patty, 
her husband, Greg, and also her family. 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOHN CURTIN 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to remember 
John Curtin of Taylorville. 
John was my neighbor, a farmer, and 
active community member, who was 
our longtime county board chair, and 
he passed away on March 10 of 2021. 
John began farming in Christian 
County in 1957. He served 12 years as 
the cattle superintendent at the Illi-
nois State Fair and president of the Il-
linois Angus Association. In 1984, he 
was designated master farmer by Prai-
rie Farmer. 
John was a dedicated servant and 
leader to his community. And as I men-
tioned, he served on the county board 
as chair, but he was on the board for 40 
years. The Taylorville Chamber of 
Commerce awarded him with a lifetime 
achievement award in recognition of 
his community service. 
John was a fellow parishioner within 
the Holy Trinity Catholic parish as 
part of St. Mary’s in Stonington, in 
Taylorville, and his legacy will be re-
membered forever. 
My prayers are with his brothers, six 
children, 
grandchildren, 
and 
great 
grandchildren. 
HONORING TODD HANNEKEN

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1740 
April 14, 2021 
State Trooper, Todd Hanneken, of De-
catur, Illinois, who lost his life on 
March 25. 
Todd fulfilled his lifelong dream of 
becoming a state trooper. He was a 20- 
year veteran of the Illinois State Po-
lice and always went above and beyond 
the call of duty. 
In 2018, Todd was awarded the Illinois 
State Police Medal of Honor for heroic 
actions he took to rescue a man out of 
a burning car, ultimately saving that 
man’s life. 
For so many, Todd was more than a 
state trooper. He was a husband, fa-
ther, son, brother, and beloved friend. 
Those that knew Todd will remember 
him for his kindness and compassion. 
Todd cared deeply about his commu-
nity, always wanting to help others in 
need. 
A tragic accident took Todd’s life, 
and my prayers are with his friends 
and family, both at home and with the 
State Police, and particularly his wife, 
Shelley; and sons, Ben and Nick. Todd 
was a hero in every sense of the word 
and will truly be missed. 
f 
RECOGNIZING U.S. CAPITOL 
POLICE FORCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, in March, 
the House passed legislation to award a 
Congressional Gold Medal to the men 
and women of the U.S. Capitol Police 
for their heroism on January 6 and for 
their daily efforts to protect the insti-
tutions of our democracy. 
On April 3, once again, we saw an ex-
ample, of not only the dangers in which 
they place themselves through their 
service, but also the courage they bring 
to that service. 
In the short span of fewer than 100 
days, the U.S. Capitol force lost three 
members as a result of attacks on the 
Capitol complex. Yesterday, we hon-
ored one of those Capitol policemen, 
Billy Evans. But in a real sense, we 
honored every member of the United 
States Capitol Police. 
Some years ago, I lost a member of 
the Capitol Police who lived in my dis-
trict, J.J. Chestnut. Wendy, his wife, 
was at the ceremony yesterday for 
Billy Evans. That was in 1998. He and 
Officer Gibson lost their lives in de-
fending this Capitol on that date. And 
while a Congressional Gold Medal is a 
very fitting tribute, it can neither less-
en the grief felt by their fellow officers 
nor reduce the sense of unease that so 
many of them must still be feeling 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, this has been a chal-
lenging time for the Congress and for 
all of us, but it certainly has been a 
time of challenge for the Capitol Police 
force. And surely the force will be 
going through a period of change and 
adaptation for some time to come, as 
will all of us who serve here in the Cap-
itol complex. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a mo-
ment on this floor to say thank you for 
those who still stand watch at the 
doors and the vehicle barriers, who pa-
trol the neighborhoods and the office 
buildings, who sit ready to respond 
quickly and courageously to any emer-
gency, never knowing what the next 
alarm might bring. 
Mr. Speaker, in particular, I thank 
the men and women who have served 
on the security detail that the Capitol 
Police have assigned to me in my role 
as majority leader. You get to know 
them as friends, as protectors, and as 
family. 
Since being elected to House leader-
ship, I have been privileged to know 
some of the best of the force. They are 
representative 
of 
an 
extraordinary 
group of people. In order to protect 
their safety and privacy, I will not 
share their names, but they know who 
they are. Each and every one of them 
not only have my immense gratitude 
and respect, but they have the admira-
tion of my entire staff, whom they 
have gotten to know very well. 
Mr. Speaker, again, as I know them, 
I know that they are representative of 
an extraordinary group of people that 
we call the United States Capitol Po-
lice. 
On January 6, when the rioters first 
breached the Capitol’s defenses, these 
officers acted without delay, according 
to their training, to get me quickly to 
a safe location, but they couldn’t get 
everybody. And so many were still in 
this Chamber as the insurrectionists 
cried for the lives of Members of Con-
gress. 
Capitol Police checked in with staff 
and did their best to get us information 
in a situation that was chaotic and 
rapidly changing for us, but more im-
portantly, for them on the front lines. 
My security detail until the last Con-
gress had been led by an officer, who 
now serves in the force in a more sen-
ior capacity. He was by my side almost 
every day for nearly two decades. I 
came to know him and his family well, 
just as I have other members of my de-
tail. As I said, they are like family to 
all of us in the majority leader’s office. 
I know that is true of the minority 
leader’s office and the whip’s office and 
the Speaker’s office and the Demo-
cratic whip’s office, and our Senate 
counterparts. 
The senior officer on my detail for-
merly was present at the Capitol on 
January 6, and he acted heroically, and 
he was the one that tried to save the 
life of the woman who was shot—who 
was 
an 
insurrectionist—because 
he 
stood next to her, unarmed, when that 
incident occurred. He acted heroically 
in trying to keep the rioters away from 
the House Chamber and in responding 
when one of them was shot in the hall-
way, as I just pointed out. 
I know that the events of that day 
still weigh very heavily on him and on 
each of us—on his colleagues, on all of 
us. And I hope that he and his col-
leagues know that their grief weighs 
heavily on all of us whom they protect 
and serve. 
President Joseph Biden, in speaking 
yesterday to the family of Officer 
Evans, showed empathy. He showed 
that he felt their pain, their concerns, 
their trauma. And I would urge all my 
colleagues, when you see members of 
the United States Capitol Police, uni-
formed or in plain clothes, that you 
thank them. 
Mr. Speaker, I talked about Officer 
Chestnut. Wendy, his wife, as I said, 
was here yesterday. He was shot in the 
back by the assailant, who then shot 
Officer Gibson in the office that I now 
occupy. It was Tom DeLay’s office at 
that point in time. 
Mr. Speaker, we thank them, we 
honor them, but the way we really 
need to respond to them is to make 
sure they have the resources, the train-
ing, the equipment, and the authority 
to respond to those who confront them 
with violence and fatal force. 
We lost Officer Sicknick. This Cap-
itol was invaded because there were re-
straints, frankly, on the United States 
Capitol Police. We need to make sure 
that they have the authority to re-
spond, to protect this Capitol, this de-
mocracy, our Members, our staff, the 
visitors to this Capitol, but also, im-
portantly, themselves. 
We know that this is a difficult mo-
ment and the Capitol Police force is 
facing challenges like never before in 
its 193-year history. 
In the early 1960s, I worked here as 
an intern in a United States Senator’s 
office, and I had a number of friends 
who also were in law school or some 
other school, who were ‘‘Capitol cops’’ 
we called them. Thankfully, the risks 
were minimal. That is not true today. 
And as the risks are great, we must re-
spond robustly to ensure that we have 
the capacity and the will to meet those 
risks. 
Mr. Speaker, may God bless and pro-
tect our U.S. Capitol Police officers.

PROTECTING AMERICANS’ 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, the Second Amendment is a 
fundamental piece of the U.S. Constitu-
tion. The right to keep and bear arms 
is one of Americans’ inalienable free-
doms. This has been true for centuries, 
and despite what the White House 
would like you to think, this is still 
true. 
Right now, the left is advancing un-
precedented threats to Americans’ Sec-
ond Amendment rights. Just last week, 
the President rolled out two executive 
orders that would restrict the rights of 
law-abiding citizens. The President 
proudly announced that he is willing to 
undercut our core constitutional lib-
erties. With his pen and, I might add, 
without Congress, the President can 
singlehandedly unravel our rights.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1741 
April 14, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I fear that we are em-
barking on a perilous path. Now, more 
than ever, we must recommit to pro-
tecting this vital freedom. 
Instead of stripping away Americans’ 
constitutional rights, the U.S. Govern-
ment should be focused on enforcing 
law and order. Instead of stripping 
away Americans’ constitutional rights, 
the U.S. Government should be focused 
on securing our southern border. In-
stead of stripping away Americans’ 
constitutional rights, the U.S. Govern-
ment should be focused on protecting 
our citizens from gang violence, stop-
ping human trafficking, and stopping 
the illicit drugs that cross our porous 
southern border. 
The President is correct that we have 
a public health crisis. We have a public 
health crisis on the southern border. 
While the Commander in Chief spends 
time plotting ways to subvert the U.S. 
Constitution, 
the 
brave 
men 
and 
women of U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection are encountering record 
numbers of migrants attempting to 
cross the border unlawfully. 
Last month alone, border agents en-
countered more than 170,000 migrants, 
a colossal 400 percent increase from the 
same time last year. Yes, this is indeed 
a crisis. But the problem is not with 
the law-abiding citizens. The problem 
is not with the Second Amendment. 
Here in Washington, our leaders need 
to get their priorities in order. We need 
to uphold our oath to defend the U.S. 
Constitution. We need to defend the 
American people from foreign threats. 
And we need to protect our funda-
mental freedoms. 
f 
COMMITTING TO RECONCILIATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise because I love my coun-
try. 
And, Mr. Speaker, I rise today under-
standing that we are in mourning. Our 
country is grieving. There are many 
reasons for this, but we still haven’t 
acknowledged that there is something 
we can do to eliminate some of the 
mourning and grieving. 
We are mourning because police offi-
cers are being murdered. Many have 
been murdered across the length and 
breadth of the country. We are mourn-
ing because persons are losing their 
lives at the hand of the police. Many 
have lost their lives. We are in a state 
of mourning, but it goes back far be-
yond George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, 
Sandra Bland. It goes back to really 
the founding of the country because we 
have not atoned for some of our trans-
gressions. Literally, we have com-
mitted crimes against humanity for 
which we have not atoned. 
Slavery was a crime against human-
ity; we have not atoned. What we did 
to the indigenous population was a 
crime against humanity; we have not 
atoned. The internment of the Japa-
nese, based upon our xenophobia, we 
have not atoned. Banning Chinese from 
the country, we have not atoned. What 
we did to Muslims, banning them from 
the country, we have not atoned. 
There must be atonement. We have 
to reconcile. We did not do so in 1868, 
as it relates to slavery. We should 
have, but we had a President who was 
antithetical to it, Andrew Johnson. 
So, I am going to offer a resolution, 
a resolution to create a department of 
reconciliation such that we can accom-
plish our atonement, get out of this 
grieving, and bring our country to-
gether. 
When we had a systemic need for 
dealing with agriculture, we created a 
Department of Agriculture. When com-
merce was in need of some help, we cre-
ated a Department of Commerce. We 
have a Department of Labor because 
labor needs the kinds of legislation and 
the kinds of benefits that a Congress 
can accord labor, the persons who actu-
ally work for a living. When we needed 
defense, we created a Department of 
Defense and a Department of Homeland 
Security. 
So, I am proposing that we have a de-
partment of reconciliation so we can 
deal with the issues that have haunted 
this country for centuries. A depart-
ment of reconciliation with a secretary 
of reconciliation, a department of rec-
onciliation with a budget, a depart-
ment of reconciliation with under sec-
retaries so that we can accomplish our 
atonement with a department of rec-
onciliation. It can be done. 
I am not asking for a commission. 
This is about a commitment. A depart-
ment indicates that you are committed 
to a cause. We were committed to 
labor; that is why we have a Depart-
ment of Labor. We were committed to 
education; that is why we have a De-
partment of Education. We now need a 
department of reconciliation, a com-
mitment to ending this long, sorrowful 
grieving that we have suffered over the 
years so that we can understand each 
other better and work together better 
with each other. 
If we fail to do this, if we fail to rec-
oncile, Dr. King’s words will become 
our greatest nightmare. He indicated 
that we must learn to live together as 
brothers and, I would add, sisters, or 
we will perish together as fools. We 
need a department of reconciliation. I 
will introduce a resolution for such. 
f 
KEEPING FOOD ON AMERICANS’ 
TABLES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, last month, the House 
Agriculture Committee hosted its first, 
or at least more fulsome, attempt at 
publicly reviewing the pandemic and 
Congress’ response. 
This pandemic has infiltrated our 
lives in every sense possible. Unfortu-
nately, the brunt of it was borne by our 
communities and, in particular, fami-
lies already living paycheck to pay-
check. In too many instances, arrogant 
career politicians issued statewide, in-
discriminate edicts, forcing businesses 
and schools to shut their doors, plum-
meting our communities into a deep 
recession. 
As the end of the pandemic nears, I 
hope we can use what we learned in 
that hearing to provide these families 
with more holistic services, particu-
larly as they engage in a postpandemic 
economy that will look wildly dif-
ferent. 
The Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program, or SNAP, currently pro-
vides nutrition assistance to 43 million 
individuals, with an average individual 
benefit of $183. Total SNAP-related 
spending in fiscal year 2020 was $78.9 
billion, which includes benefits, admin-
istration, nutrition education, employ-
ment and training, and program integ-
rity. Of that $78.9 billion, $74.2 billion 
was solely for benefits. 
By 
way 
of 
the 
Families 
First 
Coronavirus 
Response 
Act, 
the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act, and the Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act of 2021, more than 
$37.8 billion has been appropriated to 
respond to the supplemental nutrition 
assistance needs of our communities. 
This monumental response is in addi-
tion to the more than $7.7 billion per 
month in standard SNAP benefits. Be-
yond direct funding from Congress, the 
former and current administrations 
have issued more than 4,000 adminis-
trative waivers to States. These waiv-
ers impact operations related to pro-
gram eligibility, distribution of bene-
fits, employment and training, and 
more. 
These facts are startling. Combined 
with myriad social service policies, in-
cluding those found in the short-
sighted, outrageously naive American 
Rescue Plan, we are in the midst of our 
Nation’s second-largest expansion of 
entitlements. 
Unsurprisingly, leading economists 
and Wall Street analysts have said key 
parts of that bill are poorly targeted to 
the specific needs of the crisis. As a 
friend in southwest Missouri recently 
said, unnecessary rescue diminishes a 
person’s 
dignity 
and, 
if 
repeated 
enough, gives way to debilitating de-
pendency. 
The witnesses who joined us for the 
hearing are our everyday heroes. They 
are the folks who responded without 
hesitation to the needs of their com-
munities infested by a pandemic that 
took the lives of hundreds of thousands 
of our friends, neighbors, and family 
members. Whether it be the farmer 
who chose to donate their crop or the 
food bank that opened additional sites 
to be more accommodating, the wit-
nesses 
who 
testified 
deserve 
our 
thanks. 
I must also applaud the Department, 
particularly the former administra-
tion. Like it or lump it, the bulk of the

April 14, 2021 
response originated in the last Con-
gress under President Trump. Quick- 
thinking folks implemented Pandemic- 
EBT and the Farmers to Families Food 
Box Program, two projects that remain 
remarkably beneficial to families in 
need. 
The latter, apparently terminating 
this morning, as I found out through 
the press, fell victim to inconceivable 
criticism. There is always room for 
more solutions to the needs of our Na-
tion. 
The Farmers to Families Food Box 
Program had open eligibility, making 
certain anyone and everyone in need, 
regardless of status, income, or house-
hold size, has supplementary access to 
meat, dairy, and produce in an unprec-
edented time of crisis. This program 
provided more than 156 million boxes 
to households across the United States. 
With this program, farmers were able 
to redirect their products, and Amer-
ican workers were able to sustain their 
employment or join new ventures, all 
to ensure fresh foods found their way 
into the homes of millions in need. 
Regardless of the cherry-picked hic-
cups this committee and USDA’s lis-
tening sessions were made aware of, 
the program worked exactly as in-
tended. Shamefully, and because this 
was the brainchild of President Trump, 
the Biden administration has decided 
again to ignore rural America and con-
tinue to fund programs that favor bil-
lion-dollar organizations in the cities 
that they serve. 
f 
CALLING FOR RECOGNITION OF 
THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
GREEN of Texas). The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to mark the 106th anniversary of the 
Armenian genocide. 
The first genocide of the 20th cen-
tury, the atrocity saw the massacre of 
more than 1.5 million men, women, and 
children at the hands of the Ottoman 
Empire. 
As a young boy in Fresno, my Arme-
nian friends told me the stories of the 
horrors that their parents and grand-
parents witnessed. They never forgot 
the tragedy, and neither will I. 
After decades of inaction, both the 
House and the Senate passed resolu-
tions in 2019, calling for the recogni-
tion of the Armenian genocide. It is my 
hope that the Biden administration 
will officially recognize these crimes 
against humanity. 
b 1030 
Just this past year, we witnessed an-
other atrocity against the Armenian 
people in Artsakh. There is no denying 
the attacks made by Azerbaijan and 
Turkey were premeditated and coordi-
nated in an effort to eliminate the in-
digenous 
Armenian 
population 
of 
Artsakh. 
No words on our part can undo the 
terror and brutality suffered by Arme-
nians, but actions can. We can learn 
from these atrocities and commit our-
selves to ensuring that something like 
this never happens again, for starters, 
by requiring that Azerbaijan and Tur-
key comply with their agreement to re-
lease prisoners of war and civilians 
held captive by Azerbaijan. 
It is time the United States reestab-
lish its presence in this part of the 
world by standing up for human rights. 
CRITICAL NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address also a critical need for infra-
structure in America. It is time that 
we build new transportation systems 
and rehabilitate structures to support 
a modern economy and a way of life in 
the 21st century. President Biden’s 
American jobs plan is an attempt to do 
just that with historic investments in 
improving infrastructure and putting 
millions of people to work. We need 
that. 
The goals of this plan is to help all 
Americans. I urge my Republican col-
leagues to help forge a bipartisan pack-
age to invest in America. 
When it comes to transportation, 
California is leading the way by build-
ing the Nation’s first sustainable, true 
state-of-the-art high-speed rail project. 
It will deliver a fast, reliable, and eco- 
friendly way to connect to Los Ange-
les, to the bay area, and ultimately 80 
percent of the State’s population, get-
ting cars off the roads and cleaning our 
air. 
It will spur an investment in the 
economy that will deal with the eco-
nomic fallout of the pandemic, cre-
ating reliable, good paying jobs; sup-
porting small businesses; and investing 
in socially disadvantaged communities. 
In my home of California’s San Joa-
quin Valley, we are already seeing the 
benefits of high-speed rail. 
My legislation, the High Speed Rail 
Corridor Development Act of 2021, will 
help fund this forward-thinking project 
and other rail corridors across the Na-
tion. 
Big projects we know are hard. They 
always have been. So bold action, if we 
are serious about improving our future, 
is necessary. Since I first came to Con-
gress, it has been one of my highest 
priorities to invest in America’s infra-
structure. 
What do I mean by this? 
Investing in our Nation’s water infra-
structure, a 21st century system of 
transportation, nationwide broadband, 
and our schools are all investments 
that the majority of Americans want 
to see us make. 
The debate we are engaged in now is 
how we define and what we can agree 
on in terms of infrastructure and how 
we pay for it because we must. 
So let’s show the American people 
that their government can work to-
gether and make important invest-
ments that are long overdue that will 
benefit America and regain our lead. 
Today, we rank 13th in the world in 
terms of infrastructure. That is not the 
place America ought to be. We need to 
make these investments in our people 
and in our country, which are good in-
vestments that will pay dividends for 
future Americans and future genera-
tions to come.

HONORING MATTHEW GRUDA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in honor and recognition of 
Matt Gruda, my senior adviser and 
someone who has become both a friend 
and a confidant. 
Matt will be departing our team and 
beginning a new and exciting chapter 
in his home State of Florida, and I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
pay tribute to Matt and the remark-
able work he has done for our team 
over the past 2 years. 
Matt joined our team in 2019, and 
quickly became an asset to both our 
team and our district. His expertise, 
sincerity, thoughtfulness, quick wit, 
and always pleasant demeanor made 
him fast friends with so many in our 
community with a wide range of per-
sonalities for sure. He has touched so 
many lives, and he has made more of 
an impact than he realizes. 
Mr. Speaker, I could rattle off a list 
of wins and crucial behind-the-scenes 
tasks attributed to Matt, but we would 
be standing here for quite a while. So 
to be brief, I want to thank him from 
the bottom of my heart for his many 
incredible efforts not just for Team 
FITZPATRICK, but for so many organiza-
tions, schools, businesses, local govern-
ment officials, municipalities, and the 
people 
across 
Pennsylvania’s 
First 
Congressional District. 
Matt does all things with passion, 
and he has given so much of his heart 
to our community. So much of what 
has been accomplished over the past 2 
years would not have been possible 
without Matt’s contributions. 
Matt’s drive, determination, posi-
tivity, and compassion are a winning 
combination and truly a rarity in this 
world. I believe this is why he has been 
and will continue to be so successful in 
all walks of life. He recognizes the im-
portance and value in differing opin-
ions and how we can learn from those 
who think differently from us; and to 
produce success, we often need to think 
outside the box; and to best serve our 
community and our country, we must 
give everything we have and never give 
up. He has led our team for over 2 years 
in this manner, inspiring creativity, 
collaboration, and passion throughout 
the ranks. 
Matt’s most admirable quality is his 
resiliency. I have spoken to Matt’s 
mom, Zena, who talked about the fact 
that his road to get here was full of 
challenges, bumps, twists, and turns; 
yet he faces each one of them with an 
open mind and looks at them as an op-
portunity to learn and to improve and 
grow better.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1743 
April 14, 2021 
From an early age, Matt’s love of 
baseball was apparent. He would spend 
hours and hours practicing and throw-
ing a ball against a wall; and once on 
the field, his eyes and smile reflected 
his unbridled enthusiasm and deep- 
rooted passion for the game. On the 
field, he was in complete control and 
nothing else mattered. Simply to be 
there in uniform along with his team-
mates was a great feeling for him. 
Then, in seventh grade, he developed 
a tumor on his spine. After three ex-
tensive surgeries, Mr. Speaker, he was 
told he could not play the game any-
more. For most kids, that heart- 
wrenching gut punch would be a piv-
otal moment in their life, one in which 
they would give up in defeat. But not 
Matt Gruda. Faced with a challenge 
and the unknown, he decided to seize 
on the opportunity, becoming the 
youngest assistant coach and umpire in 
the history of the league. He con-
fronted his adversity, not viewing it as 
a stumbling block, but as a stepping 
stone to success. He has continued to 
build stepping stones to success with 
every challenge he has faced. 
In speaking with the people who 
know Matt best, they described him as 
someone who does not hold a grudge; 
someone who is always looking on the 
bright side of things; someone who is 
kind, considerate, and is always eager 
to make you smile; someone who is a 
good friend, a caring brother, and a 
wonderful son; and someone whom you 
would always want on your team. 
I know that I am grateful to have 
had Matt on our team for the past 2 
years. He will always have an honorary 
spot on our bench. As a mentor, Mr. 
Speaker, I stand here today very proud 
of what Matt has accomplished and so 
excited for him to take this next chap-
ter by storm. He is a bright, talented, 
and determined young man, and I look 
forward to seeing all that he will ac-
complish in life. 
On behalf of our entire team and our 
entire community, we thank Matt. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COSTA). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. 
PLASKETT) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, during 
times of crisis and upheaval, societies 
have a unique opportunity to re-
imagine themselves, to fix wrongs, and 
to make themselves better than they 
were previously. The pandemic of 1917 
created the Roaring Twenties. The 
aftermath of the Civil War brought 
railroads, canals, and bridges to con-
nect us. The Great Depression gave us 
the New Deal. 
After the devastation of the COVID 
pandemic and the truth reveal of our 
systemic problems of racism, economic 
inequality, wealth and healthcare dis-
parities, we must use this time and 
this opportunity to not only forge for-
ward, but to correct wrongs. While the 
American Rescue Plan is changing the 
course of the pandemic and delivering 
relief for working families, this is not 
the time to build back the way things 
were. This is a moment to reimagine 
and rebuild a new economy. 
The American jobs plan is an invest-
ment in America that will create mil-
lions of good jobs, rebuild our coun-
try’s infrastructure, and position this 
United States to outcompete China and 
other nations. The American jobs plan 
will invest in America in a way that we 
have not invested since we built the 
interstate highways and won the space 
race. 
The United States of America is the 
wealthiest country in the world, yet we 
rank 13th when it comes to overall 
quality of our infrastructure. Public 
domestic investment as a share of the 
economy has fallen more than 40 per-
cent since the 1960s. After decades of 
disinvestment, our roads, bridges, and 
water systems are crumbling. Our elec-
tric grid is vulnerable to catastrophic 
outages. Too many lack access to af-
fordable high-speed internet and to 
quality housing. 
The past year has led to job losses 
and 
threatened 
economic 
security, 
eroding more than 30 years of progress 
in women’s labor force participation. It 
has unmasked the fragility of our care-
givers’ infrastructure. It has never 
been more important for us to invest in 
strengthening our infrastructure and 
our competitiveness, and in creating 
good paying union jobs of the future. 
This must include a 21st century in-
frastructure—deployment of broadband 
and closing the digital divide in this 
country—creating the modern bridge 
that will unite and create more eco-
nomic and opportunity equity in our 
country. 
Unlike 
past 
major 
investments, 
President Biden’s plan also prioritizes 
addressing longstanding and persistent 
racial injustice. The plan targets 40 
percent of the benefit of climate and 
clean infrastructure investments to 
disadvantaged communities. The in-
vestment of $100 billion in broadband 
internet will be the component that 
will make America a leader, an inno-
vator, once again. 
Broadband internet is the new elec-
tricity. It is necessary for Americans 
to do their jobs; to create jobs; to par-
ticipate equally in school learning, 
healthcare, and to stay connected. It is 
estimated, however, that 10 percent— 
over 30 million Americans—live in 
areas where there is inadequate or no 
broadband infrastructure. Americans 
living in rural areas, on Tribal lands, 
and in the territories particularly lack 
adequate access. Even in our urban 
areas, many have stark differences in 
access to internet and to jobs. 
President Biden’s American jobs plan 
is visionary and exactly what people 
across this country have been asking 
from our Nation’s leaders for years, 
even decades. Representing the Virgin 
Islands, I am especially excited about 
his focus on building infrastructure 
that is resilient to our changing cli-
mate, electrifying our highway system, 
investing heavily in transit and other 
cleaner mobility options, and working 
to eliminate the digital divide. 
In announcing his plan, the President 
has taken our voices—the voices in 
Congress—and has put those words into 
action. The American jobs plan will 
not only make bold transformational 
investment in our Nation’s transpor-
tation infrastructure, it will do so with 
an emphasis on creating good paying 
jobs, supporting American manufac-
turing, and investing in rural and 
urban communities alike. 
Earlier this year, the New Democrat 
Coalition unveiled our agenda for the 
first 100 days of the 117th Congress. The 
New Dems share the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration’s vision to build back bet-
ter, and we will work together to move 
our country forward. 
We must rebuild our communities 
and our economy better than before 
with the American jobs plan. Now is 
the time to think boldly with a once- 
in-a-century investment to create mil-
lions of good–paying jobs. 
f 
40TH ANNIVERSARY OF RC–135S 
CRASH IN ALASKA 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the anniver-
sary of the tragic loss of a 55th Wing 
RC–135 Cobra Ball aircraft on the re-
mote island of Shemya, Alaska. 
Forty years ago last month, Cobra 
Ball tail number 2664 crashed on ap-
proach to Shemya Air Force Base, a 
rugged outpost on the far western tip 
of the Aleutian Islands. Six brave 
American airmen perished in the fiery 
crash that day, an eternal reminder of 
the cost of the Cold War and the price 
of vigilance we too often take for 
granted. 
The RC–135 reconnaissance aircraft— 
designated Cobra Ball—is designed to 
rapidly collect telemetry and special 
intelligence on ballistic missiles in 
flight. Throughout the Cold War and to 
the present day, reconnaissance crews 
from the 55th Wing are dispatched on 
short notice around the world to fly 
the RC–135 to gather technical intel-
ligence on weapons tests that cannot 
be obtained by any other method. This 
information is used to verify treaty 
compliance and to support the contin-
uous development of America’s stra-
tegic and theater missile defense capa-
bilities. 
Throughout the Cold War, the Stra-
tegic Air Command kept the Cobra Ball 
on a continuous 24-hour alert status on 
Shemya Island in the northern Pacific, 
affectionately known as The Rock. 
Their job was to launch at a moment’s 
notice to keep a watchful eye on Soviet 
ballistic missile tests conducted from 
the Kamchatka Peninsula. 
On March 15, 1981, the 24 crew-
members on board the RC–135 tail num-
ber 61–2664 were en route to Shemya

from Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, 
where they had been waiting for the 
weather at Shemya to clear. Blizzard 
conditions 
and 
extreme 
crosswinds 
were ravaging the small exposed island. 
This weather was not uncommon, just 
another day at the office for 55th Wing 
aircrew. However, after receiving clear-
ance to land, weather conditions dete-
riorated rapidly. 
b 1045 
Firsthand 
accounts 
from 
crew-
members onboard describe the violent 
buffeting they experienced on descent 
as like being on the end of a yo-yo. The 
belly of the aircraft struck the edge of 
a cliff on the approach end of the run-
way, shearing off the landing gear. As 
the damaged aircraft slammed into the 
runway, engines three and four ex-
ploded and the fuselage broke in half. 
Flames engulfed the crew compart-
ment as the disintegrating aircraft slid 
2,000 feet, eventually careening off the 
runway and down a hill. 
The scene was chaotic as crew-
members worked to free themselves 
and their teammates from the burning 
wreckage while the blizzard raged. Mi-
raculously, 18 crewmembers escaped 
from the flames that day. Their bodies 
burned and broken, they worked fever-
ishly to extract their fellow airmen 
from the fiery wreckage. 
In the end, six men died on that lone-
ly airfield that day. Their names were: 
Major William Bennett, 
Captain Larry Mayfield, 
First Lieutenant Loren Ginter, 
Master Sergeant Stephen Kish, 
Staff Sergeant Steven Balcer, and 
Staff Sergeant Harry Parsons, III. 
We honor their service and their sac-
rifice and commend their spirit to the 
Creator. We pray for their families and 
loved ones who cherish their memory. 
We also honor the survivors of this 
tragic crash who will forever bear the 
scars of their service and the memory 
of that day. May we never forget what 
they gave to the cause of freedom, and 
that it was the dedication of warriors 
like these that won the Cold War. And 
may we pledge to honor their sacrifice 
by recommitting ourselves to eternal 
vigilance in the defense of freedom. 
f 
PROTECTING QUALITY OF LIFE OF 
VETERANS IS A TOP PRIORITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Mrs. LURIA) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2368, the COV-
ENANT Act, legislation to ensure our 
Nation’s veterans can receive the bene-
fits they deserve after being exposed to 
toxic substances in the course of their 
service. 
Mr. Speaker, protecting the quality 
of life of our veterans is a top priority 
of this Congress, and particularly for 
my colleagues on the House Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee, where I chair the 
Disability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee. 
One such veteran I have the privilege 
of representing, Master Sergeant Brian 
Graves of Virginia Beach, flew missions 
over the Middle East for the United 
States Air Force. Today, he lives with 
breathing problems after inhaling jet 
fumes and being exposed to other tox-
ins during his time of service. 
The COVENANT Act will dramati-
cally streamline the VA benefits proc-
ess for thousands of veterans like Mas-
ter Sergeant Graves. 
Between June 2007 and February 2021, 
we know that 13,900 veterans filed a 
disability benefit claim related to toxic 
exposure. Mr. Speaker, of those nearly 
14,000 veterans, only 4,000 claims were 
granted. That is simply unacceptable. 
We cannot allow history to repeat 
itself. Veterans like myself watched 
our peers who served in Vietnam wait 
decades for the benefits they deserve. 
The recent veterans who served in 
the Middle East, southwest Asia, east 
Africa, and the Philippines need our 
help today. Mr. Speaker, they are hurt-
ing and, in some cases, dying. Congress 
must not neglect them in their time of 
need. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the COVENANT 
Act, a comprehensive approach to se-
curing benefits for veterans exposed to 
toxic substances overseas.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF COR-
PUS 
CHRISTI 
POLICE 
CHIEF 
MIKE MARKLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Corpus Christi, Texas 
Police Chief Mike Markle on his career 
of public service, and to congratulate 
him on his upcoming retirement. 
From his service in the United States 
Navy as a hospital corpsman to his 31- 
year career service at the Corpus Chris-
ti Police Department, Chief Markle has 
consistently placed the needs of others 
before himself. Enlisting in the police 
academy in 1989, he protected the 
streets for many years with courage 
and determination. He has served as a 
field training officer, on the Honor 
Guard, and on the SWAT team. 
Corpus Christi turned to him to lead 
during the Police Department’s transi-
tion in 2015. As head of the Corpus 
Christi PD, he pursued excellence in 
leadership and a commitment to learn-
ing. His priority was to improve com-
munity outreach and address the mod-
ern challenges of policing. 
His legacy of helping others stretches 
beyond his police work, as he currently 
serves on the board of directors for the 
Wesley Community Center. There is no 
question that Chief Markle left a last-
ing impact on the Coastal Bend region, 
and he will be sorely missed. 
I thank him for his commitment to 
protecting the citizens of Corpus Chris-
ti, and I wish him well in his future en-
deavors. 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

Gracious God, we earnestly pray 
today to walk in Your presence. With 
You beside us, may Your nearness both 
inspire and compel us to take steps in 
response to Your divine mercy, in obe-
dience to Your divine guidance, and in 
gratitude for Your divine compassion 
for us. 
May each thought that comes to our 
minds be of Your will. 
May each aspiration our souls con-
jure be worthy of Your blessing. 
May every action we take reveal 
Your love to those who need it so des-
perately. 
May every word we speak give honor 
to You. 
It is our humble prayer that in every-
thing we do today, we would be instru-
ments of Your transcendent love in 
this place, of Your sacrificial love for 
all of creation, and of Your redeeming 
love for this world and for each of Your 
children. 
We offer ourselves to You in the hope 
of Your mercy and in the strength of 
Your name. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
JULIA LETLOW TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
SCALISE) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great honor that on behalf of the 
entire Louisiana delegation and on be-
half of all of my colleagues, we wel-
come JULIA LETLOW to Congress. 
It has been quite a journey, and it is 
not a journey that she walks alone. 
This 
has 
been 
JULIA
and 
Luke 
LETLOW’s journey for over a year, and 
we all still grieve for the loss of Luke, 
who tragically died just days before he 
would have been sworn into Congress. 
But JULIA never backed down, never 
looked back. She moved forward, and 
she said we are going to continue this 
journey with her beautiful family. 
Madam Speaker, up in the balcony, 
we have her 3-year-old son, Jeremiah, 
and 
her 
1-year-old 
daughter, 
Jac-
queline. We welcome them, as well as 
both JULIA’s and Luke’s families, who 
are in the balcony. 
There are so many great attributes 
that JULIA is going to bring to this 
Congress. She graduated from the Uni-
versity of Louisiana Monroe. She has 
been in higher education her entire life 
and truly dedicated her life to serving 
others. She will be serving on the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, as well as 
on the Agriculture Committee, two im-
portant committees that enrich this 
country, as well as her district. 
She has a great record of service. We 
are so excited to have her in our dele-
gation. We are especially proud that 
JULIA becomes, today, the first Repub-
lican woman ever elected to Congress 
from Louisiana. 
Madam Speaker, let me welcome our 
newest Member of Congress, JULIA 
LETLOW. 
Ms. LETLOW. Madam Speaker, it is 
an honor and a privilege to stand here 
today as the first Republican woman 
elected to Congress from Louisiana. 
Representing the people of the Fifth 
Congressional District is a great re-
sponsibility, and I pledge to work hard 
for you in Congress. 
My district is blessed with some of 
the best resources in the Nation, and 
no one knew that better than my hus-
band, Luke, who was elected to this 
very seat but who we lost to COVID 
just days before he was set to take of-
fice. 
Luke and I were a team with a goal 
to better our State and our country. I 
want to thank him for paving the way 
for me. I am here today to carry that 
torch forward, to be a voice for our 
farmers, to champion education, to 
help bring broadband to our rural com-
munities, and to ensure our economy is 
thriving again. 
The last year has not been easy for 
our country. Too many families, like 
mine, have experienced tragedy be-
cause of this pandemic. To those fami-
lies, I see you, I hear you, and most im-
portantly, I pray with you. 
I want to thank my family, both the 
Letlows and the Barnhills, for being 
the rock-solid, godly people you are in 
my life. 
I also cannot thank my staff, the 
Louisiana delegation, and my congres-
sional colleagues enough for guiding 
me and welcoming me so fully. And I 
thank everyone who has reached out 
and prayed for my family these past 
few months. 
Today, as I start my journey in Con-
gress, I choose hope. I want to be part 
of a revival of honesty, integrity, and 
hard work within these hallowed Halls. 
I will stand up for what is right and 
true, bringing hope of a better tomor-
row for my children and for yours.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1746 
April 14, 2021 
CONGRATULATING 
JAMES 
BISH, 
CONGRESSIONAL 
APP 
CHAL-
LENGE WINNER 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to congratulate the winner of the 
Ohio Ninth Congressional District’s 
second annual Congressional App Chal-
lenge, James Bish, of Bay High School 
in Bay Village, Ohio. 
James’ app, called Anonymous FRQ 
Grading, is an impressive tool for 
teachers and students to submit re-
sponses to essay questions free of bias 
in evaluation. James’ application re-
ceived strong scores in each phase, 
from concept to design to the skills 
shown to produce it. 
The judges for this year’s competi-
tion included computer science profes-
sionals and scholars from across the 
district, such as Max Herzog from the 
Cleveland Water Alliance and Kelly 
Zelesnik from Lorain County Commu-
nity College. 
I am amazed by the strong showing 
of submissions and participation from 
across the district that we received 
this year. Developing STEM education 
must be a priority not only within our 
community but across our Nation as 
well, and the Congressional App Chal-
lenge is an opportunity to foster such 
critical skills. 
I offer my sincerest congratulations 
to James Bish on his win and thank 
him for the impressive and important 
work that went into creating this app. 
And I thank James’ teacher at Bay 
High, Rob Grossman, who provided 
guidance and mentorship to James dur-
ing this challenge. 
f 
PROTECTING INFANTS WHO 
SURVIVE ABORTIONS 
(Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to implore my colleagues to join 
me in the fight to protect the most vul-
nerable in our society, infants who sur-
vive abortions. 
Again and again, more than 75 times, 
Democrats have refused to even allow a 
vote on my legislation, the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act. 
This, Mr. Speaker, is shameful. 
Every child should be welcomed with 
joy and wonder, no matter the cir-
cumstances of their birth. I will not 
stop working until this legislation is 
passed and signed into law, so all 
newborns have a chance at life. 
Just 2 hours ago, Representative KAT 
CAMMACK filed a discharge petition so 
that Democrats can’t continue to block 
the Born-Alive Act. It is my sincerest 
hope that every Member of Congress, 
Democrat or Republican, finds the 
courage to add their name to this peti-
tion. This is the simplest decision that 
any of us can make. Do you support ba-
bies receiving lifesaving care after they 
are born, or would you deny these chil-
dren that care and murder them or 
leave them to die in front of you? 
I am challenging Congress to stand 
up and do the right thing. I urge my 
colleagues to sign the discharge peti-
tion to ensure no American child is de-
nied medical care. 
f 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, last week, some of my Doc-
tors Caucus colleagues and I took a 
trip to the southern border to observe 
the ongoing humanitarian crisis. What 
we saw was nothing short of tragic. 
The bottom line is that the situation 
stems from several key Biden policies 
that have created an incentive for mi-
grants to cross the border illegally. 
President Biden abolished the Remain 
in Mexico policy despite the fact that 
it helped migrants avoid numerous 
dangers. The policy was accompanied 
by his administration’s moratorium on 
deportations, not abiding by title 42’s 
expressed purpose. 
Let there be no mistake, no one gets 
into this country without the ex-
pressed permission of drug cartels at 
our southern border. Not only are ille-
gal immigrants coming in, but drugs, 
weapons, and human trafficking are 
coming now in record numbers. 
Even worse, this crisis falls on terri-
fied unaccompanied children. I will 
never forget seeing a 4-year-old with 
nothing on her back except her clothes 
and a telephone number written in 
Sharpie upon her chest. 
Only securing our border will end 
this crisis. I ask the Biden administra-
tion to return to the previous adminis-
tration’s border policies. 
f 
b 1215 
HOUSE CHINA TASK FORCE 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, last year, 
I was proud to serve on the House 
China Task Force with a number of my 
Republican colleagues. Over six months 
through engagement and consultation 
with national security and trade offi-
cials, foreign policy experts, the busi-
ness community, and government offi-
cials, we compiled and unveiled a com-
prehensive report with more than 400 
policy recommendations for how to ad-
dress the existential challenges posed 
by China. 
Addressing the challenges posed by 
China will be one of the greatest issues 
Congress and our country face in the 
decades to come. As we confront these 
issues, bipartisan work is needed. The 
China Task Force report provides a 
roadmap with specific policy ideas and 
goals regarding how the U.S. can better 
combat the threat of the Chinese Com-
munist Party. Two-thirds of the legis-
lative recommendations are bipartisan; 
and, overall, more than one-quarter of 
the recommendations have already be-
come law or have been implemented by 
the prior Trump administration. 
As members of the Ways and Means 
Committee, we authored important 
provisions of the report that will help 
return American intellectual property 
and critical supply chains to the 
United States. We also included legis-
lation to reform and strengthen the 
World Trade Organization to level the 
playing field for American trade. 
Mr. Speaker, to preserve and grow 
national economic security, we need to 
act. I ask everyone to read the report 
and work with us to get this done in a 
bipartisan way.

CELEBRATING 100TH BIRTHDAY OF 
RALPH 
JOHNSON 
FROM 
CHER-
OKEE, IOWA 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the birthday of 
Ralph Johnson from Cherokee, Iowa, 
who turned 100 years old on Monday. 
Ralph is a member of the Greatest 
Generation, serving in the Navy during 
World War II. He truly embodies the 
bravery, courage, and selfless sacrifice 
of an American patriot, working as a 
head mechanic in the Pacific theater. 
If you talk with Ralph, he will tell 
you harrowing stories about his serv-
ice, like the time the Japanese flew so 
low over his ship, he could see the pi-
lot’s face. 
On behalf of a grateful nation, we 
thank Ralph for his service and sac-
rifice. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to 
take a moment to recognize Linda 
Sommerfeld and David Scott, who 
made Ralph’s special day great. 
Happy birthday, Ralph. We wish you 
many blessings.

DEMPSEY WAGNER IS KEEPING 
LEE COUNTY, IOWA, SAFE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to thank a young girl in 
my district for her charitable actions 
this year. 
For their birthday, most 6-year-olds 
ask their parents for gifts—a dollhouse, 
a puppy, or a trip to Disney World. But 
Dempsey Wagner of Lee County has de-
cided to use her special day to raise 
funds to help keep Iowans safe. 
Dempsey, who tragically lost two rel-
atives to drowning in 2017, is using her 
sixth birthday to help raise money for 
the Lee County Rescue Boat. The res-
cue boat, along with a trained dive

team, have the capability to save many 
lives on the Mississippi and Des Moines 
Rivers and surrounding Lee County 
lakes. 
Last year, Dempsey used her fifth 
birthday to raise $3,000 for Lee County 
Crime Stoppers Police Puppies. But 
this year, Dempsey has used her sixth 
birthday to more than double her 
record, raising over $13,610 for the Lee 
County Rescue Boat. My husband, 
Curt, and I were proud to contribute to 
this worthy cause. 
It is ‘‘Iowa nice’’ stories like this 
that make me more proud to represent 
Iowa and the Second District. 
Keep up the good work, Dempsey, 
and thank you for making both Lee 
County and Iowa safer. 
f 
BORDER CZAR KAMALA 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, weeks 
ago, the Biden administration made 
Vice President KAMALA HARRIS the bor-
der czar. 
The question I have is: Which border? 
We learned today that Czar Kamala 
is traveling to Guatemala. While we do 
need cooperation from Guatemala in 
halting the flow of illegal entrants 
from Central America, it defies logic 
that weeks after her appointment, Czar 
KAMALA
HARRIS
has not visited the 
very border—our border—with Mexico 
that she has been tasked with pro-
tecting. 
It seems as if the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration has gone out of its way to 
ignore the seriousness of the border 
crisis it has created. Even as the num-
ber of illegal border crossers and unac-
companied 
minors 
shatter 
records, 
Democrats have declared that every-
thing under the sun is infrastructure 
except a border wall. In fact, a wall 
protecting our border might be the 
only thing Democrats do not want to 
throw money at right now. 
To the Biden administration and 
Czar Kamala: Border security is na-
tional security, and the American peo-
ple are pleading for you to take steps 
to end this crisis you created. It is 
time to answer their call. 
f 
SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, over the 
last few months, the situation at our 
border has evolved into a serious crisis 
caused by policy changes from the 
Biden 
administration 
that 
have 
incentivized illegal immigration. This 
is not my opinion; this is the informa-
tion I received firsthand on my recent 
trip to the border. 
These policy changes include: ending 
the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy; imple-
menting catch and release; and suspen-
sion of the portion of title 42, which al-
lowed for expelling unaccompanied mi-
nors. 
I 
witnessed 
massively 
over-
crowded rooms, or pods, where many 
children are being held for weeks at a 
time. 
The enormous influx of illegals has 
given the drug cartels the insidious op-
portunity to ship drugs into our coun-
try, leading to an increase in fentanyl 
smuggling by more than 2,000 percent 
and illegal weapons by more than 100 
percent. 
Of grave concern to those I spoke 
with is the rumor that title 42 will be 
fully rescinded by the White House, 
which would lead, Mr. Speaker, to an 
unmitigated disaster at our border. 
We ask President Biden and Vice 
President Harris to actually visit the 
border, speak with the agents on the 
ground, and learn what is going on. 
This is not a Republican or a Democrat 
issue; this is a humanitarian and na-
tional security crisis that can be 
solved. 
f 
HONORING DOROTHY WILLIAMS 
MOORE ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today, I rise to honor Dorothy 
Williams Moore on the occasion of her 
100th birthday. 
Dorothy was born in Hamptonville, 
North Carolina. She graduated from 
Catawba College, class of 1942, major-
ing in home economics. On March 20, 
1946, she married Thomas Moore and 
moved 
to 
Charlotte. 
Dorothy 
and 
Thomas had four children: Luther, 
Louanna, Neil, and Cynthia. 
Dorothy has proudly served as a 
mother, homemaker, and substitute 
teacher. 
She 
also 
taught 
Sunday 
school. 
Thomas passed away in 1986, after 
nearly 40 years of marriage. 
Dorothy still lives in Charlotte. She 
has five grandchildren and eight great- 
grandchildren. A double cancer sur-
vivor, she loves music and sang in her 
church’s choir until the onset of 
COVID–19. She also enjoys sweets, es-
pecially chocolate ice cream. 
It is an honor to pay tribute to Doro-
thy on her 100th birthday. She has led 
an amazing life, and her family is over-
joyed to celebrate with her. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
SERGEANT JIM SMITH 
(Mrs. HINSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Sergeant Jim 
Smith, who died tragically in the line 
of duty this past Friday night in Iowa. 
Sergeant Smith honorably served as 
an Iowa State trooper for 27 years. He 
was an incredible man who loved his 
family, his State, God, his fellow troop-
ers, and his community in Independ-
ence, Iowa. 
My heart goes out to his wife, Kathy, 
and their two children. I hope that the 
family can find some comfort in know-
ing that he died a hero protecting his 
community, as he did every day for 
well over two decades. 
Sergeant Smith and his service and 
sacrifice for Iowans will never be for-
gotten. 
f 
BE THE MATCH PROGRAM 
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, many 
families, including my own, have been 
impacted by cancer. For more than 
178,000 Americans diagnosed with a 
blood cancer like leukemia, lymphoma, 
or myeloma, the Be The Match pro-
gram represents hope. 
Founded in Minnesota, Be The Match 
runs the world’s largest registry de-
signed to connect patients in need of 
lifesaving blood or marrow transplants 
with a donor. In 2019, Be The Match fa-
cilitated over 6,500 transplants, giving 
hope to countless families around the 
world. Minnesota has long been a hub 
for this kind of medical innovation. 
As a co-chair of the Personalized 
Medicine Caucus, I urge all of my col-
leagues today to support the TRANS-
PLANT Act and reauthorize Federal 
partnerships like Be The Match, which 
have impacted the lives of millions. 
Connecting patients with donors and 
developing the next generation of re-
generative medicine truly represents 
the best of who we are as a society. 
I thank Representative MATSUI and 
the other sponsors of this legislation 
for their hard work. I encourage every-
one to help keep hope alive by sup-
porting this bill.

UNITED 
STATES 
ANTI-DOPING 
AGENCY REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 172) to reauthorize the United 
States Anti-Doping Agency, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 172 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United 
States Anti-Doping Agency Reauthorization 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The United States Anti-Doping Agen-
cy— 
(A) is the independent national anti-doping 
organization of the United States; and 
(B) manages the anti-doping program, re-
sults management processes, drug reference 
resources, and athlete education for all 
United States Olympic Committee-recog-
nized national governing bodies and the ath-
letes and events of such national governing 
bodies. 
(2) The United States Anti-Doping Agency 
contributes to the advancement of clean 
sport 
through 
scientific 
research, 
anti- 
doping education, and outreach programs, 
and the mission of the United States Anti- 
Doping Agency is to preserve the integrity of 
competition and protect the rights of ath-
letes. 
(3) Participation in youth sports has the 
potential to equip young athletes with im-
portant skills and values necessary for suc-
cess in life, and it is essential that the cul-
ture of youth sports emphasizes such skills 
and values. 
(4) The TrueSport program of the United 
States Anti-Doping Agency partners with 
youth sport organizations across the United 
States to promote sportsmanship, character 
building, and healthy performance through 
the use of targeted educational materials de-
signed to promote a positive youth sport ex-
perience. 
(5) In modifying the authority of the 
United States Anti-Doping Agency to in-
clude the promotion of the positive values of 
youth sport, Congress sends a strong signal 
that the goals of youth sport should include 
instilling in young athletes the values of in-
tegrity, respect, teamwork, courage, and re-
sponsibility. 
(6) Due to the unique leadership position of 
the United States in the global community, 
adequate funding of the anti-doping and 
clean sport programs of the United States 
Anti-Doping Agency is imperative to the 
preparation for the 2028 Summer Olympic 
Games, which will be held in Los Angeles, 
California. 
(7) Increased appropriations for fiscal years 
2022 through 2030 would enable the United 
States Anti-Doping Agency to directly affect 
the integrity and well-being of sport, both 
domestically and internationally. 
SEC. 3. MODIFICATIONS OF AUTHORITY. 
Section 701 of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 
(21 U.S.C. 2001) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (b)— 
(A) by amending paragraph (1) to read as 
follows: 
‘‘(1)(A) serve as the independent anti- 
doping organization for the amateur athletic 
competitions

United 
States Olympic and Paralympic Committee; 
‘‘(B) be responsible for certifying in ad-
vance any testing conducted by inter-
national organizations under the World Anti- 
Doping Code for international amateur ath-
letes and athletic competitions occurring 
within the jurisdiction of the United States; 
and 
‘‘(C) be recognized worldwide as the inde-
pendent national anti-doping organization 
for the United States;’’; 
(B) in paragraph (4), by striking the period 
at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and 
(C) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(5) promote a positive youth sport experi-
ence by using a portion of the funding of the 
United States Anti-Doping Agency to pro-
vide educational materials on sportsman-
ship, character building, and healthy per-
formance for the athletes, parents, and 
coaches who participate in youth sports.’’; 
and 
(2) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(c) DUE
PROCESS
IN
ARBITRATION
PRO-
CEEDINGS.—Any action taken by the United 
States Anti-Doping Agency to enforce a pol-
icy, procedure, or requirement of the United 
States Anti-Doping Agency against a person 
with respect to a violation of Federal law, 
including an investigation, a disciplinary ac-
tion, a sanction, or any other administrative 
action, shall be carried out in a manner that 
provides due process protection to the per-
son.’’. 
SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
Section 703 of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 
(21 U.S.C. 2003) is amended to read as follows:

of Food and Drugs shall provide to the 
United States Anti-Doping Agency any rel-
evant information relating to the prevention 
of the use of performance-enhancing drugs or 
the prohibition of performance-enhancing 
methods. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from

tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS) each will control 20 minutes.

from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 172. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 172, 
the United States Anti-Doping Agency 
Reauthorization Act of 2021. 
For two decades, Mr. Speaker, the 
United States Anti-Doping Agency, or 
USADA, has worked to ensure integ-
rity in our American Olympic and 
Paralympic sporting activities through 
the promotion and support of drug-free 
competition. 
Recommended by an Olympic com-
mittee task force, this independent or-
ganization was established to manage a 
comprehensive anti-doping program in 
the United States. And since its au-
thorization in 2000, USADA has helped 
to advance clean sports through sci-
entific research, anti-doping education, 
and outreach programs. 
To ensure USADA can continue this 
good work, H.R. 172 would extend and 
increase 
the 
authorization 
level 
through fiscal year 2030. Further, this 
bill would empower USADA to encour-
age a positive sporting environment for 
young 
athletes 
by 
providing 
edu-
cational materials on sportsmanship, 
character building, and healthy per-
formance. 
The bill also improves anti-doping ef-
forts in the U.S. by encouraging Fed-
eral agencies to coordinate and share 
information with USADA to prevent 
the 
use 
of 
performance-enhancing 
drugs and methods. 
Taken together, these actions will 
make positive improvements to the 
good work that USADA is already 
doing and provide critical support as

April 14, 2021 
we lead up to the 2028 Summer Olympic 
and Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives MIKE
THOMPSON, DIANA 
DEGETTE, and BILL JOHNSON for leading 
this important bipartisan legislation. I 
would also like to thank Ranking 
Member RODGERS and all the members 
and staff of our committee for their ef-
forts to move this legislation forward 
in a bipartisan manner. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in 
support of H.R. 172, the United States 
Anti-Doping Agency Reauthorization 
Act, 
sponsored 
by 
Representatives 
MIKE
THOMPSON, BILL
JOHNSON, and 
DIANA DEGETTE. 
This bill will reauthorize the U.S. 
Anti-Doping Agency, USADA, which is 
the national entity charged with ad-
ministering anti-doping programs in 
the 
United 
States 
for 
Olympic, 
Paralympic, 
Pan 
American, 
and 
Parapan American sports. 
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency han-
dles in-competition and out-of-com-
petition testing, results management 
processes, drug reference resources, 
and athlete education for all U.S. 
Olympic and Paralympic Committee- 
recognized sport national governing 
bodies, their athletes, and events. 
USADA is also the administrator for 
the Ultimate Fighting Championship 
Anti-Doping Program. 
Reauthorizing this important agency 
will further the advancement of clean 
sports, fair games, and positive sports-
manship. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill. We will be hearing from one of my 
colleagues here in a moment, a col-
league on the committee, BILL JOHN-
SON. 
I also want to thank the chairman 
for working together to get this done 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON) who is the lead 
sponsor of the legislation. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H.R. 172, bipartisan legislation reau-
thorizing 
the 
United 
States 
Anti- 
Doping Agency, USADA. 
Since 2001, USADA has been recog-
nized by Congress as the official anti- 
doping 
agency 
for 
Olympic, 
Paralympic, and other sporting com-
petitions in the United States. 
The organization conducts drug test-
ing for athletes, manages test results, 
and pursues bad actors who seek to un-
dermine the principles of clean and fair 
support through the use of illicit or 
banned substances. 
This important legislation reauthor-
izes USADA through fiscal year 2030 
and provides a slight funding boost to 
allow USADA to prepare for the 2028 
Olympics in Los Angeles, California. 
In addition, this legislation requires 
USADA to devote a portion of its fund-
ing to clean sport initiatives for young 
athletes and authorizes the Depart-
ment of Justice and other Federal 
agencies to cooperate with USADA in 
the course of its investigations. 
I am grateful to my colleagues on the 
Energy and Commerce Committee for 
advancing this legislation to the floor, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to yield such 
time as he may consume to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON), a col-
league and leader on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of the U.S. Anti- 
Doping Agency Reauthorization Act. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
THOMPSON, for his hard work to get 
this important legislation across the 
finish line; and I thank Ranking Mem-
ber MCMORRIS
RODGERS
for yielding 
time. 
The United States Anti-Doping Agen-
cy, or USADA, has worked hard to en-
sure that our athletic programs are the 
best in the world, and also the clean-
est. Critical to maintaining that suc-
cess is ensuring our athletes are com-
peting fairly, without the use of per-
formance-enhancing drugs, which is 
why I have introduced the U.S. Anti- 
Doping Agency Reauthorization Act. 
USADA must have the resources it 
needs to ensure the integrity of its pro-
grams and advance the American val-
ues of sportsmanship and playing by 
the rules on the global stage. 
In addition to funding the agency, 
this legislation adds a special focus on 
clean sport training for young athletes 
and their coaches, and enables USADA 
to better coordinate with Federal law 
enforcement. 
With the Olympics and other inter-
national sporting events just around 
the corner, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers. I urge support 
for the legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no additional speakers. 
I urge support, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 172. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 578. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, 
Education, and Research Act, also 
known as the FASTER Act. 
An estimated 32 million Americans, 
including approximately one in every 
13 children, are affected by food aller-
gies. These allergies can pose signifi-
cant risks, particularly when inac-
curate food labels fail to warn con-
sumers about the presence of some of 
these allergens. 
Under current law, eight allergens 
are considered major food allergens. 
These allergens include milk, eggs, 
shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, 
and soybeans. Due to their status as 
major food allergens, manufacturers 
must clearly state the presence of any 
of these ingredients on labels. 
Notably missing from this list of al-
lergens is sesame. Sesame is considered 
an allergen of growing concern. While 
its prevalence has more than doubled 
over the last decade, it is not required 
to be listed as an allergen on food 
packaging. In fact, in some cases, a 
food may contain sesame, but the in-
gredient won’t be listed at all on the 
labels, 
instead 
being 
referred 
to 
through nonspecific terms such as 
‘‘spices’’ or words that may not be eas-
ily recognized by consumers as con-
taining sesame, such as tahini. 
While many may not recognize the 
significance of a simple ingredients 
label, for many families, a lack of clar-
ity on ingredients could mean life or 
death for those who are allergic to ses-
ame. Clearly, this information should 
be prominently featured on all pack-
aged food labels. 
This is an issue we have been work-
ing on for quite some time. I previously 
introduced a bill several years ago that 
would list sesame as a major food aller-
gen, and although the Food and Drug 
Administration opened a docket to so-
licit feedback about sesame labeling, 
the agency has not been able to require 
the listing of sesame due to overly long 
regulatory processes. 
So today, Mr. Speaker, we are by-
passing these regulatory delays and 
taking 
action. 
The 
appropriately- 
named FASTER Act would quickly 
move this process along by recognizing 
sesame as a major food allergen and re-
quiring its listing on new food labels 
after a phase-in process. 
The bill will also require FDA to re-
port recommendations on how we can 
make additional improvements to pro-
tect individuals with food allergies, in-
cluding ways to add additional major 
food allergens. 
So I want to thank Representative 
MATSUI for her tireless work on this 
bill. She is the prime sponsor. We came 
so close to getting this over the finish 
line in the last Congress, and I am glad 
that today we are sending this bill to 
President Biden for his signature. I am 
proud to support the legislation. I en-
courage all Members to vote for it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 578, the Food Allergy Safety, 
Treatment, Education, and Research 
Act. This legislation is bipartisan, a 
companion of H.R. 1202, that was led by 
Representatives MCHENRY, GONZALEZ, 
and MATSUI. 
S. 578 will designate sesame as a 
major food allergen. This means that, 
with the enactment of this legislation, 
manufacturers would have to list this 
ingredient on the food packaging label 
of products containing sesame. 
Recent studies indicate that sesame 
allergies are of growing concern in the 
United States, with a prevalence rate 
on par with allergies to soy and fish, 
which are both listed as major aller-
gens under the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act. 
This commonsense legislation will 
provide consumers with the informa-
tion they need to protect themselves 
and their families from certain dan-
gerous and life-threatening allergic re-
actions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
MATSUI) who is the House sponsor of 
the legislation. 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of two of my bills 
being 
considered 
under 
suspension 
today, the FASTER Act and the 
TRANSPLANT Act. 
The Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, 
Education, and Research Act, FAST-
ER—which wasn’t as fast as I wanted it 
to be, but this act will help to improve 
the safety of more than 32 million 
Americans, including 5.6 million chil-
dren, 
living 
with 
potentially 
life- 
threatening food allergies. 
Under current law, mandatory label-
ing is required for major food allergens 
recognized by the FDA like milk, eggs, 
and peanuts. 
My grandson, Robby, has a peanut al-
lergy, and for families like mine, accu-
rate food ingredient labels are vital to 
making safe and healthy choices. The 
time we have spent reading the labels 
and having discussions about whether 
he can go to a birthday party or not, or 
go to camp or not, and having friends 
over, it was just heartbreaking. We 
need to have those labels be clear. 
Critically, the FASTER Act extends 
these labeling protections to nearly 1.6 
million Americans allergic to sesame 
by requiring sesame to be included as 
an ingredient on a packaged food label. 
The bill also expands the research 
necessary to find new treatments and 
is an important step in the right direc-
tion to finding an eventual cure for 
food allergies. 
Today is a testament to the hard 
work of thousands of grassroots advo-
cates who sent emails, made calls, and 
visited Members of Congress and staff 
to build support and make sesame the 
ninth allergen to be labeled under law. 
The outpouring of support was in-
credible. The FASTER Act will truly 
make a difference for those living with 
potentially life-threatening food aller-
gies, and we are proud that it can now 
be sent to President Biden’s desk. 
b 1245 
I also rise today in support of H.R. 
941, the TRANSPLANT Act, my legis-
lation to reauthorize the C.W. Bill 
Young Cell Transplantation Program 
and the National Cord Blood Inventory 
for another 5 years. 
Every 3 minutes, someone is diag-
nosed with blood cancer. For patients 
and families facing these fatal diseases, 
a bone marrow or cord blood transplant 
may be the best treatment or only po-
tential for a cure. 
Congress has long recognized the 
need to coordinate lifesaving trans-
plants between patients and unrelated 
donors at the national level and has 
shown strong bipartisan support over 
the years for the program. 
We must continue to encourage do-
nors and give these patients with oth-
erwise fatal blood cancers a second 
chance at life. That is why I joined 
with Representative BILIRAKIS to intro-
duce the TRANSPLANT Act. 
This past year, there has been a new 
sense of urgency for this timely reau-
thorization. We have seen how Be The 
Match’s status, as the designated oper-
ator of the national program, has 
helped bone marrow couriers continue 
to facilitate transplants during the 
pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1751 
April 14, 2021 
We must act swiftly to preserve this 
critical designation and ensure pa-
tients with otherwise fatal blood can-
cers continue to have access to trans-
plants, both during and after the cur-
rent public health crisis. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation today so we may further 
prevent any lapse in funding. I support 
both bills. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
MCHENRY), one of the leaders of this 
legislation and the leader of the Finan-
cial Services Committee. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mrs. RODGERS, my classmate and a 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee for yielding. It is an amaz-
ing thing to be with you here today, 
and it is an amazing thing to be here 
today to talk about this important bill. 
As the lead Republican cosponsor of 
the House companion to S. 578, I rise in 
support of the FASTER Act. 
Millions of Americans suffer from 
life-threatening food allergies. More 
than 1.5 million Americans are allergic 
to sesame, in particular, yet there is no 
current requirement to include the in-
gredient on product labels. This legis-
lation would declare it the ninth major 
allergen to be recognized by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration and up-
date laws to require the labeling of ses-
ame. 
This bill would also require the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to regularly review promising food al-
lergy treatments and research. This is 
a major bipartisan priority. These ef-
forts will help slow this rapidly grow-
ing disease and ultimately find and 
fund a cure. 
Finally, the FASTER Act establishes 
a scientific process and framework for 
establishing additional allergens cov-
ered by the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act. 
I am proud to serve as cofounder and 
co-chair of the newly formed Congres-
sional Food Allergy Research Caucus, 
along with Congresswoman DORIS MAT-
SUI. We recognize there is more we can 
do to help those 32 million Americans, 
including many who are children who 
suffer from food allergies. 
We can and we should do more to in-
crease funding into research, therapies, 
and 
treatments 
for 
food 
allergies. 
Sending this legislation to the Presi-
dent’s desk would be a major first step 
to achieving our goal of improving 
treatment opportunities. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill, S. 
578, the FASTER Act, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.

eligibility, we will once again help 
these institutions conduct critical re-
search into minority health disparities. 
COVID–19, Mr. Speaker, has further 
exacerbated many of the inequities 
that minority communities experience 
when interacting with the healthcare 
system, inequities that we know ex-
isted long before the pandemic. In 
order to address the inequities in our 
healthcare system and in our society, 
we must confront them head-on and 
work together to eliminate them. 
By supporting NIMHD and the aca-
demic institutions funded through it, 
we are helping to advance minority 
health disparity research and strength-
en the diversity of the scientific work-
force by recruiting and retaining indi-
viduals 
underrepresented 
in 
these 
fields. 
This bill is a step toward progress 
and an equitable public health system. 
This bill is named after our former col-
league, the late and great Congressman 
John Lewis from Georgia, who intro-
duced this legislation last Congress. He 
was a dear friend and a longtime cham-
pion of eliminating disparities across 
the board, and he is certainly missed. 
I want to thank my colleagues, the 
two 
sponsors, 
Representatives 
Barragan and Carter, for leading the ef-
fort on this legislation this year. This 
is truly bipartisan. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 189, the John Lewis NIMHD Re-
search Endowment Revitalization Act, 
which was introduced by my col-
leagues, 
Representatives 
Barragan, 
Carter, and Taylor. 
This bill will authorize the National 
Institute 
on 
Minority 
Health 
and 
Health Disparities to award research 
grants to current and former centers of 
excellence that conduct research on 
minority health disparities. 
Health inequities are disproportion-
ately experienced by minority popu-
lations, and these disparities can have 
adverse impacts on health outcomes, 
economic opportunities, and overall 
quality of life. The current COVID–19 
pandemic has only underscored these 
disparities, which is why this bill is so 
important. 
Continued support of these centers of 
excellence is critical in advancing mi-
nority health, addressing health in-
equities, and expanding educational 
and training opportunities for those in-
terested in further advancing research 
in this space. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
and especially my colleague on the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee on the

Republican side, Representative BUDDY 
CARTER, for leading this initiative. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BARRAGA´ N), a member of our com-
mittee and the lead sponsor of the bill. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 189, the John 
Lewis National Institute on Minority 
Health and Health Disparities Research 
Endowment Revitalization Act. This is 
a bipartisan bill that I introduced with 
my colleague from Georgia, Congress-
man CARTER. 
It is fitting that this bill comes be-
fore 
us 
during 
National 
Minority 
Health Month because this legislation 
moves us closer to ending the public 
health disparities facing communities 
of color. We need to understand why 
people of color are more likely to get 
certain illnesses. 
It is a tragic reality, but solutions 
are out there. H.R. 189 will fund the re-
search that will help us find solutions 
and save lives. 
This bill would, once again, allow for 
current and former NIMHD or Health 
Resources and Services Administration 
centers of excellence to receive re-
search endowment funding, money that 
is critical in the fight to reduce minor-
ity health disparities. 
The Research Endowment Program 
at the National Institute on Minority 
Health and Health Disparities provides 
funding to the endowments of academic 
institutions across the country, such as 
Charles R. Drew University in my dis-
trict, Morehouse School of Medicine, 
University of Puerto Rico School of 
Dental Medicine, University of New 
Mexico School of Medicine, Howard 
University College of Pharmacy, and so 
many others. 
The goal of the program includes pro-
moting minority health and health dis-
parities research capacity and infra-
structure, increasing the diversity and 
strength of the scientific workforce, 
and enhancing the recruitment and re-
tention of individuals from health dis-
parity populations that are underrep-
resented in the scientific workforce. 
This is critical legislation that is 
going to play a huge role in addressing 
and researching disparities. 
During the COVID–19 health emer-
gency, communities of color were once 
again disproportionately affected. Re-
search into health disparities is more 
crucial than ever. 
I want to thank my cosponsors, and I 
want to thank Chairman PALLONE for 
working to help me get this important 
bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues 
to support this bill. Let’s get this done 
and across the finish line. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER), an important leader 
on this legislation as well as on the 
committee. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, 
thank 
you 
to 
Congresswoman 
BARRAGA´ N for being a champion of this 
issue, and she truly is a champion of 
this issue. 
The coronavirus has wreaked havoc 
on our communities, especially minor-
ity communities. Now more than ever, 
we must support minority academic in-
stitutions and the critical research 
they conduct. 
Minority academic institutions can 
play a big role in helping to address the 
systemic health disparities minority 
communities are feeling. 
We must ensure schools, including 
Morehouse College in my home State 
of Georgia, are able to conduct their 
research without disruption. Without a 
reauthorization of this program, health 
research will have to be paused or 
abandoned altogether. We must not let 
this happen. The efforts of these re-
searchers will help better prepare all of 
us to respond to the coronavirus and 
other health inequities more effec-
tively. 
I urge passage of this very important 
legislation. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 189. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 941. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the C.W. Bill Young 
Transplant Program and the National 
Cord Blood Inventory Program facili-
tate lifesaving bone marrow and umbil-
ical cord blood donations to help pa-
tients suffering from blood cancers, 
disorders, and diseases. 
These critical programs assist trans-
plant patients by providing additional 
information about bone marrow and 
cord blood transplants, maintaining an 
efficient process for identifying donor 
matches, and increasing the number of 
unrelated donors available for trans-
plant. The programs also collect data 
and expand research to improve patient 
outcomes. 
I thank my colleagues—Representa-
tives MATSUI, BILIRAKIS, and PINGREE— 
for their bipartisan leadership on this 
bill, and I would urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 941. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 941, the Timely Reauthoriza-
tion of Necessary Stem-Cell Programs 
Lends Access to Needed Therapies Act, 
or the TRANSPLANT Act. 
As co-chair of the Blood Cancers Cau-
cus, I urge my colleagues to support 
the TRANSPLANT Act. This bill is 
about providing hope to those who are 
struggling with life-threatening ill-
nesses. The TRANSPLANT Act reau-
thorizes the C.W. Bill Young Trans-
plant Program, in addition to the Na-
tional Cord Blood Inventory Program. 
I remember Bill Young, Chairman 
Young, a great friend of ours, and he 
said that this was one of his greatest 
accomplishments. I also know that 
CHRIS
SMITH, who will be speaking 
later, was also involved in this. He has 
been a champion on this issue, Mr. 
Speaker. So I appreciate both of them. 
This Federal program provides crit-
ical support in the advancement of re-
search for better treatments and the 
infrastructure necessary to organize 
registries, 
which 
will 
help 
ensure 
transplant patients have access to life-
saving procedures. Simply put, its con-
tinued reauthorization is vital for pa-
tients with diseases like blood cancer, 
sickle cell anemia, and inherited meta-
bolic or immune system disorders. 
I sincerely appreciate the work of my 
friend and colleague and fellow Blood 
Cancers Caucus co-chair, Congress-
woman MATSUI, in addition to the leg-
acy of bipartisan leadership and sup-
port of these programs by Members 
like, as I said, CHRIS SMITH. 
I thank the chairman, as well and the 
ranking member, for placing this par-
ticular bill on the agenda. I know it 
will get through the Senate this time. 
Additionally, I appreciate the crit-
ical daily work of the National Marrow 
Donor Program, operating the Be the 
Match national registry, connecting 
patients in search of a cure with life-
saving bone marrow donors, even in the 
midst of this historic pandemic. 
I would also like to take a moment 
to recognize the great work of Dr. Jo-
anne Kurtzberg, the president of the 
Cord Blood Association. She also serves 
in multiple roles at Duke University, 
including the director of Carolinas 
Cord Blood Bank. Dr. Kurtzberg has 
dedicated her professional career to 
cord blood research, banking, and 
transplantation; and she is an inter-
nationally recognized umbilical cord 
blood transplanter. She advised Con-
gress on the creation of the public cord 
blood banking program, which was part 
of the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Re-
search Act of 2005. Dr. Kurtzberg con-
tinues to be a trusted adviser to Con-
gress on this important program. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to join us in expediting passage of this 
lifesaving bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, but I think my 
colleague does, so I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, today, the House of 
Representatives will vote to reauthor-
ize the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Re-
search Act, a law that I authored in 
2005. This was an original idea of mine 
20 years ago. 
My good friend from Florida just 
mentioned 
Dr. 
Kurtzberg. 
Dr. 
Kurtzberg was in the meetings that we 
held in drafting this legislation, and 
she provided incredible insights as to 
what we should do, what path we 
should follow. So I appreciate him rec-
ognizing her. 
I also thank Artur Davis, who was 
my Democratic colleague and the prin-
cipal Democratic cosponsor of the bill 
during those several years. It took 5 
long years of hard work and numerous 
setbacks, but the bill was finally 
signed into law on December 20, 2005. 
The new law created a nationwide 
umbilical cord blood stem cell program 
designed to collect, derive, type, and 
freeze cord blood units for transplan-
tation into patients to mitigate and 
even cure serious disease. Pursuant to 
the law, it also provided stem cells for 
research. The new cord blood program 
was combined with an expanded bone 
marrow initiative, which was crafted 
over several years by our distinguished 
colleague, Congressman Bill Young. 
Umbilical cord blood stem cells, Mr. 
Speaker, obtained after the birth of a 
child have proved to be highly effica-
cious in treating some 70 diseases, in-
cluding sickle cell disease, lymphoma, 
leukemia, and in treating metabolic 
and immune deficiencies. Scientists 
are continuing to study and better un-
derstand the regenerative effects of 
cord blood cell therapies for other dis-
eases and disabilities, including au-
tism. I would say in like manner, bone 
marrow donations are also providing 
lifesaving transplants for some of those 
very same diseases. So we have great 
regenerative initiatives that will be 
continued. 
The National Cord Blood Inventory, 
NCBI, provides funding to public cord 
blood banks participating in the pro-
gram to allow them to expand the na-
tional inventory of cord blood units 
available for transplant. These units 
are then listed on the registry by the 
Be the Match program. The funds ap-
propriated thus far have led to an im-
portant increase in the overall number 
of high-quality cord blood units avail-
able through the national registry, now 
totaling 111,000 NCBI units. Within the 
Be the Match Registry, there are now 
more than 800,000 worldwide. 
The program registry, Mr. Speaker, 
allows patients and physicians to lo-
cate matching cord blood units, as well 
as adult donors for marrow and periph-
eral blood stem cells. The program is 
the world’s largest, most diverse donor 
registry, with more than 23 million vol-
unteers. To date, the National Marrow 
Donor Program/Be the Match, through 
its operation of the program, has facili-
tated more than 105,000 transplants.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1754 
April 14, 2021 
According to Be the Match, more than 
40,000 patients have received cord blood 
transplants. 
The reauthorization before us au-
thorizes $23 million each year for 5 
years for the cord blood side and, 
again, some $30 million each year for 
the bone marrow program. 
Mr. Speaker, each year, nearly 4 mil-
lion babies are born in America. In the 
past, virtually every placenta and um-
bilical cord was tossed as medical 
waste. Today, doctors have turned this 
medical waste into medical miracles. 
Not only has God, in His wisdom and 
goodness, created a placenta and an 
umbilical cord to nurture and protect 
the precious life of an unborn child, but 
now we know that another gift awaits 
immediately after birth. Something 
very special is left behind: Cord blood 
that is teeming with lifesaving stem 
cells. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, this is 
a very important bill and needs to pass 
as soon as possible. I really appreciate 
the chairman placing the bill on the 
agenda. I urge the Senate to pass it as 
soon as possible, and, of course, my col-
leagues today, if we can pass this bill 
immediately so we can get it to the 
Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 941. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-

each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 164. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the rising cost of pre-
scription drugs continues to be a major 
issue for families all across the coun-
try. 
These 
costs 
are 
particularly 
daunting at a time when we are facing 
a severe economic downturn and the 
ongoing pandemic. 
We are committed to continuing to 
find solutions to make prescription 
drugs more affordable for the American 
people. One important way to help fam-
ilies out is to ensure they are aware of 
more 
affordable 
options, 
like 
biosimilars and generics. These are 
both cheaper options, but, unfortu-
nately, utilization of these products 
continues to be too low here in the 
United States. 
The 
Advancing 
Education 
on 
Biosimilars Act of 2021 is commonsense 
legislation that will help provide pa-
tients and healthcare providers with 
greater information about biologics 
and biosimilars. To do this, the bill re-
quires the FDA to establish a public 
website with educational materials, in-
cluding what products are interchange-
able, as well as how to report any ad-
verse events. 
In addition, the bill would support 
the development of continuing edu-
cation programs for healthcare pro-
viders about biologics. It is critical 
that healthcare providers and patients 
are aware of all of their options, and 
this legislation will certainly help do 
that. 
I am pleased to work with my col-
leagues in the Senate on this legisla-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 164, the Advancing Education on 
Biosimilars Act. 
This bill is a bipartisan companion to 
H.R. 1873, championed in the House by 
Dr. BUCSHON and Congressman PETERS. 
This bill would require the FDA to 
maintain 
and 
operate 
an 
internet 
website to provide educational mate-
rials for healthcare providers, patients, 
and caregivers on biological products, 
including 
biosimilar 
products 
and 
interchangeable biosimilar products. 
It also would require the Department 
of Health and Human Services, HHS, to 
develop continuing education programs 
or to improve existing programs for 
healthcare providers, such as doctors 
and nurses, to promote a better under-
standing of biosimilar interchangeable 
products. 
By increasing awareness about avail-
able biosimilar products and providing 
educational resources for physicians

and patients about their benefits, we 
can increase adoption of these lower 
cost alternative therapies when appro-
priate and drive down drug costs for 
Americans across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bipartisan effort to lower drug costs 
through the uptake of biosimilar prod-
ucts, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON), 
a great member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee and a great re-
source for us nonphysicians. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak in support of S. 164, the 
Advancing Education on Biosimilars 
Act of 2021, which is the Senate com-
panion of H.R. 1873, a bill that I intro-
duced with my friend and colleague, 
Congressman SCOTT PETERS from Cali-
fornia. 
This bipartisan, bicameral bill will 
require FDA to create a public website 
to 
educate 
patients 
and 
providers 
about biological and biosimilar prod-
ucts. 
As new biological and biosimilar 
products become available, it is impor-
tant that physicians have current in-
formation on these therapies in order 
to choose the best treatment for their 
patients. 
Availability of information and edu-
cation on these new and complex treat-
ments for providers and patients will 
lead to healthy competition in the bio-
logic and biosimilar product space and 
ultimately help to lower the cost of 
these important drugs for patients. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I look forward to the Presi-
dent signing it into law. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
everyone to vote to pass this bill so we 
can quickly make this law and get it to 
the President. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 164. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 415. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, rising prescription drug 
costs are a concern for so many Ameri-
cans. Skyrocketing costs can result in 
some people postponing or altering 
treatment because the necessary drugs 
are simply priced out of reach. 
One way to help reduce drug costs is 
to provide early access to generic 
drugs. This legislation we are consid-
ering today will help to do that by en-
suring that exclusivity, which can 
delay generics from entering the mar-
ket, is only made available to truly in-
novative products. This will ensure 
that drug manufacturers cannot game 
the system by simply making small 
tweaks to old drugs as a way to block 
or delay competition. The legislation 
will also codify the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration’s 
current 
approach 
to 
awarding exclusivity. 
I thank Representatives SCHRADER 
and GUTHRIE for their bipartisan work 
on this legislation with Senators CAS-
SIDY, SMITH, and MARSHALL. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
415, the Ensuring Innovation Act. This 
legislation is the bipartisan companion 
to H.R. 1857 led by Representatives 
GUTHRIE and SCHRADER. 
This legislation would ensure that 
only the most innovative products are 
eligible 
for 
certain 
market 
exclusivities and would increase the 
availability 
of 
lower-cost 
generic 
drugs. Great work by these Representa-
tives. 
Currently, the FDA grants 5 years of 
marketing exclusivity to drug products 
determined to be a new chemical enti-
ty. Clarifying what qualifies as a new 
chemical entity will prevent drug man-
ufacturers from receiving exclusivity 
by making minor changes to existing 
drugs, which would block generic com-
petition from the market. 
This important bipartisan legislation 
will help lower prescription drug prices 
while preserving incentives to inno-
vate. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRA-
DER), a member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of S. 415, a 
bill that has the same policy as my 
own and Mr. GUTHRIE’s here in the 
House, H.R. 1857, the Protecting Access 
to Safe and Effective Medicines Act. 
This bill is a simple fix, providing 
clarity around the drug approval proc-
ess by increasing the specificity of the 
language companies may use when sub-
mitting 
these 
complex 
and 
often 
lengthy applications. Simply put, uti-
lizing the term ‘‘active ingredient’’ 
opens the unintended opportunity for 
pharmaceutical companies to make 
minor, relatively nonpharmacological 
changes to the same chemical and pre-
vent generic alternatives from coming 
to the marketplace. By changing this 
language, as this bill does, to ‘‘active 
moiety,’’ we will be able to close an-
other loophole that can be exploited by 
companies to inappropriately obtain 
exclusivity and hold back competition 
in the marketplace, the key mecha-
nism for lowering drug prices. 
While this is good policy, it is one 
small piece of the larger drug-pricing 
conversation that we need to have. It 
demonstrates, yet again, that the poli-
cies to lower drug prices are bipartisan 
and bicameral. In fact, there are many 
such policies that did not get done in 
the last Congress that offer a starting 
point for a comprehensive approach ad-
dressing drug pricing, and now is the 
time to continue this important work. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for the help in supporting 
this important bill before us today, and 
I urge its passage. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to pass this great bill. I 
commend my colleagues for focusing 
on this particular issue, which is just 
so 
important 
to 
our 
constituents. 
Again, let’s pass this bill as soon as 
possible and get it to the President. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 415. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1215. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 1215, the Fraud and Scam 
Reduction Act. This bipartisan bill was 
introduced by Representatives BLUNT 
ROCHESTER and WALBERG with strong 
bipartisan support of 16 other Mem-
bers. It also incorporates a bill origi-
nally introduced by Representatives 
DEUTCH, BUCHANAN, and WELCH. 
Reducing scams and fraud is an issue 
of utmost importance in every commu-
nity and especially so during these un-
certain and unprecedented times. Right 
now, we are seeing the best of human-
ity, but unscrupulous scammers and 
fraudsters still abound, seeking to cap-
italize on the confusion and fear that is 
out there. 
Seniors are especially vulnerable. Ac-
cording to the most recent report from 
the Federal Trade Commission, older 
adults reported nearly $400 million in 
losses from fraud in 2018. It is rare to 
recover these losses. We all need to 
work together to protect senior citi-
zens from scams before they fall victim 
and suffer monetary losses. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill establishes a 
new senior scams prevention advisory 
group composed of relevant govern-
ment agencies and industry representa-
tives to collect and implement best 
practices that stop scammers before 
they can cause harm. It will also estab-
lish new programs to prevent fraud 
that targets seniors. The legislation 
will also improve educational mate-
rials on senior scams and make sure 
that they are publicly available. 
This legislation also establishes an 
office at the FTC dedicated to pre-
venting fraud targeting seniors and 
monitoring the market for such fraud. 
This office will also assist the FTC in 
monitoring the market for mail, tele-
vision, internet, and telemarketing 
fraud targeting seniors. The office will 
also help with consumer education on 
fraud targeting seniors. 
The bill will help reinforce the ef-
forts of the FTC to prevent fraud and 
mitigate the massive losses from fraud 
targeting seniors. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 1215, the Fraud and 
Scam Reduction Act. I want to thank 
Representative BLUNT ROCHESTER, my 
good friend Representative WALBERG, 
and the other members of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee for their 
tireless work on this important bill. 
H.R. 1215 would establish a senior 
scams prevention advisory council, 
which will create model educational 
materials to inform employees of retail 
companies and financial institutions 
on how to identify and prevent scams.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1758 
April 14, 2021 
This bill would work in concert with 
other recently enacted legislation to 
provide Americans with the tools they 
need to educate and protect themselves 
against these bad actors. It is a very 
good bill, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Delaware 
(Ms. 
BLUNT ROCHESTER), who is also a mem-
ber of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Ms. 
BLUNT 
ROCHESTER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Chairman PALLONE 
for his tireless work to advance this 
important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support 
of my bill, H.R. 1215, the Fraud and 
Scam Reduction Act. Bad actors prey-
ing on older Americans is unfortu-
nately nothing new, but in the midst of 
a global pandemic, cracking down on 
those scams must be a priority of the 
Federal Government. 
That is why I proudly introduced the 
bipartisan Fraud and Scam Reduction 
Act with my colleagues Mr. WALBERG, 
DEUTCH, BUCHANAN, and WELCH. 
The bill, as its name suggests, was 
aimed at cracking down on these scams 
by doing two main things. It would cre-
ate an advisory group under the Fed-
eral Trade Commission made up of gov-
ernment agencies, consumer advocates, 
and industry representatives, such as 
financial services and retail, to help 
identify potential sources of fraud and 
create educational materials for our 
Nation’s seniors to protect them from 
these dangerous schemes. It would also 
establish the senior fraud advisory of-
fice, which would give seniors hope in 
recovering 
their 
assets 
stolen 
by 
fraudsters and improve our under-
standing of senior fraud by encour-
aging seniors to report this activity. 
We are proud to say that the bill has 
broad support, including AARP, the 
Retail Industry Leaders Association, 
Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and West-
ern Union, as well as many more. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the most funda-
mental obligations of government is to 
protect our citizens. The least we can 
do is protect already vulnerable seniors 
from being taken advantage of by bad 
actors. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
Democrats and Republicans, for their 
work in strengthening the bill, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to vote in 
favor of the measure. 
b 1330 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from the great State of 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG), my good 
friend. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Florida for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1215, Fraud and Scam Reduction Act, 
and thank my colleague and friend, 
Representative BLUNT ROCHESTER, as 
well as the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce staff for their hard work in 
bringing the bill to the floor today. 
Sadly, in today’s digital age, scams 
targeting seniors and their hard-earned 
money are growing in number and so-
phistication. 
Every year, scammers steal billions 
of 
dollars 
from 
unsuspecting 
con-
sumers. The effect on victims can be fi-
nancially and emotionally devastating, 
and the COVID–19 pandemic has only 
made things worse. Safeguarding sen-
iors in Michigan and across the coun-
try needs to be a top priority. 
Retailers have diligently worked to 
combat these crimes. Their ability to 
educate their employees with best 
practices and training to recognize the 
signs of a scam can make a huge dif-
ference in stopping criminals. 
Our bipartisan bill builds upon the 
work retailers are doing by creating a 
Federal advisory council at the FTC to 
create a unified front against criminals 
who target our most vulnerable citi-
zens and stop this fraud before it is too 
late. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass 
H.R. 1215 so we can help stop scammers 
from perpetrating a fraud and taking 
advantage of our loved ones and our 
neighbors. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
Congress to pass this bill and get it to 
the President—actually, before that, 
we have to get it to the Senate and 
pass it immediately to protect our sen-
iors, particularly during this very dif-
ficult time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1215, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1460) to encourage States to re-
quire the installation of residential 
carbon monoxide detectors in homes, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1460. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 1460, the Nicholas and Zachary 
Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide Poi-
soning Prevention Act of 2021. 
This important bipartisan bill was 
introduced again this Congress by Rep-
resentatives ANN KUSTER and BUDDY 
CARTER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
carbon 
monoxide— 
colorless, odorless, tasteless—is a si-
lent killer. More than 400 people die, 
and approximately 50,000 people visit 
emergency rooms each year in the U.S. 
from carbon monoxide poisoning. 
The tragedy is that these deaths and 
injuries are preventable with the in-
stallation of carbon monoxide detec-
tors. However, many people are un-
aware of the importance of carbon 
monoxide detectors or don’t know how 
to install or maintain them properly. 
This bill will change that. It will as-
sist States in educating the public on 
the dangers of carbon monoxide poi-
soning and the proper use of carbon 
monoxide detectors. It will also pro-
vide States with grants so they can 
purchase and install carbon monoxide 
detectors in the homes of the elderly 
and low-income citizens, as well as in 
educational facilities. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues 
to support this measure, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1460, the Nicholas and Zachary 
Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide Poi-
soning Prevention Act of 2021. 
I thank Representatives CARTER and 
KUSTER, two great members of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce. I 
thank them for their work on this im-
portant piece of legislation and for the 
many years they have served and 
worked to protect consumers. 
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odor-
less gas produced by burning fuel, and 
most people know that. Exposure to 
unhealthy levels of carbon monoxide 
can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, 
a serious health condition that could 
result in death, unfortunately. 
Mr. Speaker, unintentional carbon 
monoxide poisoning from motor vehi-
cles and the abnormal operation of 
fuel-burning appliances, such as fur-
naces, water heaters, portable genera-
tors, and stoves kills more than 400 
people each year and sends more than 
15,000 to hospital emergency rooms for 
treatment. 
This legislation would protect Ameri-
cans from an otherwise undetectable 
harm. This bipartisan bill represents a 
longstanding commitment of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce to 
protect America’s consumers, families, 
and children. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
pass this particular bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
New 
Hampshire 
(Ms. KUSTER), who is the lead sponsor 
of the bill. 
Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding.

and now a great aunt—to a dozen little

ones, I know there is nothing more im-
portant than keeping our children and 
loved ones safe. From a young age, we 
tell our children to wear their seatbelts 
in the car, a helmet while riding a bike 
or skiing, and to handle sharp objects 
with care. We go to great lengths to 
protect our children from the dangers 
we can see, but there are threats to our 
children’s and loved ones’ well-being 
that oftentimes go undetected. 
Among the most dangerous of these 
is carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide 
is a stealthy killer. You cannot see it, 
hear it, taste it, or smell it. This dead-
ly gas claims the lives of over 400 
Americans every year and results in 
over 20,000 emergency room visits. 
Two of my constituents, John and 
April Courtney in Lyman, New Hamp-
shire, tragically lost their lives to car-
bon monoxide poisoning just this past 
year. If people know about the dangers 
of carbon monoxide and have alarms 
properly installed in their homes, trag-
edies like the one in my district, can be 
prevented. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I am so 
proud to join my good friend, Rep-
resentative CARTER, in introducing in 
the House, H.R. 1460, the Nicholas and 
Zachary Burt Memorial Carbon Mon-
oxide Poisoning Prevention Act that 
we will be voting on this evening. 
This legislation provides funding for 
States to prevent future carbon mon-
oxide-related deaths by educating the 
public about the dangers of carbon 
monoxide poisoning and installing de-
tectors in housing for the elderly and 
low-income individuals and high-traffic 
public buildings like schools. This bi-
partisan legislation will save lives. 
At a time when Congress so often 
seems divided, this legislation is proof 
that we can work together to find com-
mon ground and get things done to 
help our constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CARTER, 
and I thank our chairman, and I en-
courage all of my colleagues to vote in 
favor of this legislation. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), 
my good friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate his 
perspective on the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce as the only phar-
macist on the committee. I thank him 
for sponsoring this legislation. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1460. The bill, the Nicholas and 
Zachary Burt Memorial Carbon Mon-
oxide Poisoning Prevention Act is a 
piece of legislation that can save lives. 
It would direct the Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission to award grants 
to install carbon monoxide alarms in 
buildings and facilities that house vul-
nerable members of the population. 
According to the CDC, at least 430 
people die in the United States from 
accidental CO poisoning every year. On 
top of that, nearly 50,000 people visit 
the ER every year because of acci-
dental CO poisoning. On a higher note, 
we can curb this statistic. 
Better monitoring systems will en-
sure that people can prepare and pro-
tect themselves. This bipartisan legis-
lation, which I was proud to cosponsor 
with my good friend, Representative 
KUSTER from New Hampshire, helps us 
move the needle on this important sub-
ject. Many of us have heard stories of 
families being impacted by this tragic 
and preventable outcome. Whether it is 
seniors or children, this bill can help 
save lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for her hard work on this bill, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to pass this bill. It is a 
great bill, a good consumer protection 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1460. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

PROTECTING SENIORS FROM 
EMERGENCY SCAMS ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 446) to require the Federal Trade 
Commission to submit a report to Con-
gress on scams targeting seniors, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 446 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting 
Seniors from Emergency Scams Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FTC REPORT ON SCAMS TARGETING SEN-
IORS DURING EMERGENCIES. 
Not later than 30 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Federal Trade Com-
mission (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘Com-
mission’’) shall submit a report to Congress 
including— 
(1) a description of the number and types of 
scams identified by the Commission as being 
targeted at senior citizens; and 
(2) policy recommendations to prevent 
such scams, especially as such scams relate 
to future national emergencies. 
SEC. 3. INCREASING AWARENESS OF SCAMS TAR-
GETING SENIORS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—As soon as practicable 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Commission shall update its web portal to 
include the latest information, searchable by 
region and type of scam, on scams targeting 
seniors, including contacts for relevant law 
enforcement and adult protective service 
agencies. 
(b) COORDINATION WITH MEDIA OUTLETS AND 
LAW ENFORCEMENT.—The Commission shall 
work with media outlets and law enforce-
ment to distribute the information included 
in the web portal of the Commission pursu-
ant to subsection (a) to senior citizens and 
their families and caregivers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 446. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 446, the Protecting Seniors 
from Emergency Scams Act. Rep-
resentatives KELLY and BALDERSON in-
troduced this bipartisan legislation to 
further efforts by the FTC to stop 
fraud targeting seniors. 
This bill streamlines efforts to pro-
tect seniors from falling prey to scams 
during national emergencies, such as 
the COVID–19 pandemic, by estab-
lishing a searchable database of scams 
targeting seniors. 
In the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, we have held multiple hear-
ings exploring the rise in fraud and 
scams that have come with the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
Unfortunately, scammers often take 
advantage of the fear and uncertainty 
that results from emergency situa-
tions. And since the beginning of the 
COVID pandemic, consumers have re-
ported losing more than $300 million in 
just pandemic-related fraud. 
After Hurricane Sandy ravaged the 
East Coast, including my own district 
in New Jersey, scammers preyed on 
people who lost their homes and liveli-
hoods. We saw contracting scammers 
promising to rebuild people’s homes 
but who took the money and ran. One 
man was in prison for using fake titles 
to sell Sandy-damaged cars. 
Unfortunately, older Americans are 
targeted disproportionately and af-
fected by this fraud. Older Americans 
reported significantly bigger monetary 
losses from fraud than younger adults. 
According to a recent FTC report, 
phone scams result in the highest re-
ported losses by older adults, particu-
larly adults over 80. Phone-based scams 
can be especially problematic in emer-
gency situations like the pandemic 
when people are spending more time at 
home and seniors may be more iso-
lated.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1761 
April 14, 2021 
Representatives 
KELLY
and 
BALDERSON’s bill will help address 
these scams. It directs the FTC to issue 
a report on fraud targeting seniors dur-
ing the pandemic and how to improve 
efforts against senior scams during fu-
ture emergencies. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1345 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 446, the Protecting Seniors 
from Emergency Scams Act. I would 
like to thank Representative ROBIN 
KELLY of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee for her bipartisan work 
with Representative TROY BALDERSON 
to protect our constituents. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has turned 
the lives of millions of Americans up-
side down, unfortunately. We were all 
forced to isolate, sometimes even away 
from our families and friends, to stay 
safe. Unfortunately, it is during these 
times when bad actors aim to exploit 
the most vulnerable. Promising fake 
lifesaving medication and stimulus 
checks, scammers will stop at nothing 
to take advantage of others. 
H.R. 446 would protect Americans, es-
pecially seniors, from malicious and 
deceptive scams by augmenting the 
tools included in other recently en-
acted legislation. As they have worked 
on legislation to fight scammers, I 
have supported my colleagues’ efforts 
to incorporate provisions that encour-
age cooperation with law enforcement. 
I am pleased to see such efforts con-
tinue in this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, of course, I urge my col-
leagues to pass this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Illinois 
(Ms. 
KELLY), the lead sponsor of the bill who 
has worked so hard, particularly dur-
ing the pandemic, to address dispari-
ties in healthcare. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
the past year has been tough for many 
of us but especially difficult for sen-
iors. Many have lost friends and loved 
ones from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Increased isolation and dependence 
on digital resources have put extra bur-
dens on millions of Americans. 
From frantic calls of, ‘‘Grandma, I 
am in the hospital sick with COVID. 
Please wire money right away,’’ to 
calls from supposed Good Samaritans 
offering to run errands and then pock-
eting the money, scammers are using 
the pandemic to take advantage of vul-
nerable populations. They are preying 
on fear and uncertainty to steal money 
and personal information or sell fraud-
ulent services or products. 
One of the best ways to prevent sen-
iors from falling victim to scams is to 
supply them with the information they 
need. That is why H.R. 446 requires the 
FTC to report on the number and type 
of scams that target older adults. It 
also will have the Commission’s web 
portal updated with current informa-
tion about such scams and coordina-
tion with media outlets and law en-
forcement to disseminate scam infor-
mation. Seniors need to know what 
scams are happening in their areas so 
they can protect themselves. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
BALDERSON for joining me in leading 
this legislation and Chairman PALLONE 
for his support in advancing legislation 
to protect our seniors. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON), 
the cosponsor of the legislation. 
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 446, legislation 
aimed that at protecting older Ameri-
cans from falling victim to scammers. 
Throughout the pandemic, uncer-
tainty has led to many Americans fall-
ing victim to scam callers, especially 
vulnerable populations like seniors. We 
have a responsibility to stop bad actors 
like these scam artists in their tracks. 
That 
starts 
with 
empowering 
the 
American people with information to 
better protect themselves and their 
loved ones from falling victim. 
H.R. 446 would direct the Federal 
Trade 
Commission 
to 
identify 
scammers and make such information 
publicly available. This legislation also 
equips the FTC to more proactively 
alert the public about known scams, 
specifically in their region. 
Mr. Speaker, our seniors have suf-
fered enough. It is time to better sup-
ply them and their loved ones with the 
information needed to protect them-
selves against scammers who shame-
lessly prey on the most vulnerable. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 446, the Pro-
tecting Seniors from Emergency Scams 
Act. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port this legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote for it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 446. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

PROTECTING INDIAN TRIBES

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1762) to direct the Federal Trade 
Commission to submit to Congress a 
report on unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices targeted at Indian Tribes or 
members of Indian Tribes, and for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1762 
April 14, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 1762, the Protecting Indian 
Tribes from Scams Act. The often-over-
looked area in Federal fraud preven-
tion efforts is scams targeting Indian 
Tribes and Tribal members. The scope 
and scale of scams affecting Indian 
Tribes have not been well documented, 
hindering efforts to prevent them. 
This bipartisan bill, reintroduced 
this 
Congress 
by 
Representatives 
MULLIN and O’HALLERAN, will help get 
the needed information about fraud 
and scams targeting Tribes and mem-
bers of Tribes. This bill directs the FTC 
to consult with Indian Tribes about 
these scams and then issue a report to 
Congress that will be made public. It 
also requires the FTC to update its 
website to include information on 
these scams. 
Mr. Speaker, as this pandemic con-
tinues, scammers are taking advantage 
of people’s fear and uncertainty to 
steal 
people’s 
money 
and 
commit 
fraud. American Indians are not ex-
empt from these unfair and deceptive 
practices and may even be specifically 
targeted with certain kinds of scams. 
But there is not much information 
about it. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Representa-
tives MULLIN and O’HALLERAN for in-
troducing this bill, an important step 
in helping prevent fraud and scams tar-
geting Tribes and members of Tribes. I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1762, the Protecting Indian 
Tribes from Scams Act. I want to 
thank Representative MULLIN and Rep-
resentative O’HALLERAN for their work 
on this particular issue. This bipar-
tisan piece of legislation will help our 
Native nations. 
One area that can be overlooked in 
Federal fraud prevention efforts, Mr. 
Speaker, is scams targeting Indian 
Tribal members. The scope and scale of 
scams that target Indian Tribes have 
not been well documented, hindering 
efforts to prevent them. 
This legislation would direct the 
FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, to 
submit to Congress a report on unfair 
or deceptive acts or practices targeting 
Indian Tribes. 
Simply put, these scammers ruin 
lives, unfortunately. To address these 
scams properly, we must educate all 
Americans on how to avoid malicious 
scammers. 
This legislation passed the House last 
Congress, and I am hopeful we can 
again pass it today and get this legisla-
tion to become law as soon as possible. 
I can’t think of a better person to spon-
sor this than my good friend, Mr. 
MULLIN. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. 
MULLIN). 
Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in full support of my bill, H.R. 
1762, the Protecting Indian Tribes from 
Scams Act. The bill will help protect 
our Tribes and Tribal members from 
predatorial scams. 
Tribal communities have long been 
targets of fraud. Scammers often tar-
get vulnerable communities who re-
ceive trust or settlement payments, 
like many Tribes do. FTC data says 
that Tribe members are more likely to 
be the victims of scams and are less 
likely to report scams than any other 
group. 
H.R. 1762 will direct the FTC to study 
the types of scams that target Tribes 
and find the best ways to combat them. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
from Arizona for working with me on 
these issues, as well as many other 
issues important to Indian County. I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to pass this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1762. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

unfair and deceptive practices, and for 
other purposes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1763 
April 14, 2021 
The bill will help reinforce the impor-
tant relationship between the FTC and 
State attorneys general. 
Our State attorneys general play a 
critical role in enforcing and comple-
menting Federal consumer protection 
laws. The FTC is a relatively small law 
enforcement agency charged with pro-
tecting consumers across the country. 
By partnering with State attorneys 
general, the reach of Federal consumer 
protection efforts is expanded. Strong-
er enforcement actions can be taken 
against unscrupulous companies and 
those engaging in unfair and deceptive 
practices hurting consumers. 
When Americans are harmed by fraud 
and scams, they often turn to their 
State attorneys general for help, but 
these scammers may be targeting peo-
ple across the country. By working to-
gether, State AGs and the FTC can 
pool their resources and protect con-
sumers across the country. 
This bill will help the FTC optimize 
its collaboration with State attorneys 
general by studying the matter and 
issuing a report on how to further pro-
mote collaboration. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1766, the FTC Collabora-
tion Act. 
As bad actors and scammers continue 
their efforts to take advantage of 
American consumers, we must not 
back down when it comes to ensuring 
the safety of our constituents and au-
thenticity of consumer products. The 
FTC Collaboration Act directs the Fed-
eral Trade Commission to examine how 
it can work better with State attor-
neys general to prevent, publicize, and 
penalize scams in the United States. 
This legislation would require the 
FTC to submit a report to Congress on 
how to enhance collaboration with 
State law enforcement. I remain con-
fident this can help in other agenda 
items we can work together on in this 
particular session. It is so important 
that we work together with our col-
leagues on the State level. 
I am proud of the important steps 
this bill takes to keep consumers safe 
and, importantly, prioritize our most 
vulnerable during COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers. In closing, I ask my col-
leagues to support this very important 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers. I urge 
support for the bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1766. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

DEBARMENT 
ENFORCEMENT 
OF 
BAD ACTOR REGISTRANTS ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1002) to amend the Controlled 
Substances Act to authorize the debar-
ment of certain registrants, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1002 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Debarment 
Enforcement of Bad Actor Registrants Act of 
2021’’ or the ‘‘DEBAR Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. DEBARMENT OF CERTAIN REGISTRANTS. 
Section 304 of the Controlled Substances 
Act (21 U.S.C. 824) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(h) The Attorney General may issue an 
order to prohibit, conditionally or uncondi-
tionally, and permanently or for such period 
as the Attorney General may determine, any 
person from being registered under this title 
to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a 
controlled substance or a list I chemical, if 
the Attorney General finds that— 
‘‘(1) such person meets or has met any of 
the conditions for suspension or revocation 
of registration under subsection (a); and 
‘‘(2) such person has a history of prior sus-
pensions or revocations of registration.’’. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1002. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1002, the Debarment En-
forcement of Bad Actor Registrants 
Act of 2021, or the DEBAR Act of 2021. 
One of the critical missions of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration is 
enforcing and implementing the Con-
trolled Substances Act in order to pre-
vent drug diversion and limit access to 
substances that may pose a risk if used 
incorrectly. 
One important lever the DEA has at 
its disposal to manage diversion or 
noncompliance with the law is the abil-
ity to revoke or surrender an individ-
ual’s controlled substance registration, 
which is needed to handle controlled 
substances. 
A recent report by the Department of 
Justice Office of the Inspector General 
found weaknesses in the DEA’s current 
registration processes and instances 
where the agency did not fully utilize 
its regulatory authorities to address 
noncompliance. Specifically, the in-
spector general found cases where enti-
ties whose registration were revoked 
were later able to obtain a new license. 
For example, the report included one 
case where a doctor who had their reg-
istration 
revoked 
for 
serious 
mis-
conduct then moved to another State 
under the authority of a different DEA 
field division and was granted a con-
trolled substances registration after re-
applying. 
Another example in the report in-
cluded a dentist who had voluntarily 
surrendered his medical license and 
DEA registration on two separate occa-
sions. The dentist had also been con-
victed of a felony, which is grounds for 
suspension or revocation of an individ-
ual’s registration under the Controlled 
Substances Act. However, this dentist 
was still able to obtain another DEA 
registration. 
Amid rising substance abuse and 
tragic drug overdoses, errors like these 
can be tragic and simply should not be 
happening. H.R. 1002 would address 
these errors by authorizing the debar-
ment of any registrant who either 
meets the criteria for temporary or 
permanent suspension or revocation or 
has a history of prior suspensions or 
revocations. 
I thank my committee colleagues— 
Representative LATTA, in particular— 
for leading this legislation, and also 
Ranking Member RODGERS
for her 
work on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1002, the Debarment En-
forcement of Bad Actor Registrants, or 
the DEBAR Act, which was introduced 
by my very good friend, Mr. LATTA. 
This provision would give the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, DEA, de-
barment authority to prohibit a person 
who has repeatedly violated the Con-
trolled Substances Act from receiving 
a registration to manufacture, dis-
tribute, or dispense a controlled sub-
stance. 
It makes a lot of sense. A recent De-
partment of Justice Office of the In-
spector General report found that when

certain bad actor registrants have 
their registration revoked, they can re-
apply for registration the very next 
day. Registrants who pose a significant 
risk of diverting drugs could be given 
the opportunity to do so once again. 
We have to stop this. That is why 
this legislation is so vital. 
Repeat offenders should not be al-
lowed to get a new registration from 
the DEA just days after their previous 
registration was revoked because they 
broke the law. Limited debarment au-
thority is a commonsense and effective 
administrative tool to address diver-
sion, fraud, and misconduct. 
I strongly support this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. LATTA). 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate my good friend from Florida 
for yielding. I also thank the chairman 
of the committee for bringing this bill 
before us today on the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1002, the Debarment En-
forcement of Bad Actor Registrants 
Act of 2021, or the DEBAR Act. 
In the 116th Congress, we worked vig-
orously to tackle the coronavirus and 
address the needs of those who were 
suffering. One of the hardest issues fac-
ing Americans during this time was 
substance abuse, which, on average, 
takes nearly 130 lives each day in our 
Nation. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention reported that more than 
88,000 drug overdoses occurred in a 1- 
year period ending in August of 2020, 
making it the deadliest year for U.S. 
overdoses. 
In 
Ohio 
alone, 
opioid 
overdoses 
reached record levels, rising 16 percent 
in the second quarter of 2020. Prior to 
the pandemic, these rates were, thank-
fully, declining over a 24-month period. 
We need to act immediately to put an 
end to this crisis. The DEBAR Act pro-
vides the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration, DEA, debarment authority to 
permanently prohibit a person or enti-
ty that has violated the Controlled 
Substances Act from being able to re-
ceive a registration to manufacture, 
distribute or dispense a controlled sub-
stance. 
This legislation would also close 
loopholes and reduce the circulation of 
illegal substances across our Nation 
and keep bad actors from reapplying 
for new licenses once revoked. There is 
no silver bullet when it comes to fight-
ing the opioid epidemic; however, the 
DEBAR Act will help address what is 
needed to combat this crisis, save lives, 
and stop bad actors from contributing 
to addiction. 
Again, I thank the chairman, my 
friend from New Jersey, for bringing 
the bill to the floor. I also thank our 
ranking member from Washington for 
her help on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
urge passage of this good bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
also urge support for the legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1002, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

Speaker, on that I demand the yeas

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

ENSURING COMPLIANCE AGAINST 
DRUG DIVERSION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1899) to amend the Controlled 
Substances Act to provide for the 
modification, transfer, and termination 
of a registration to manufacture, dis-
tribute, or dispense controlled sub-
stances or list I chemicals, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1899 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring 
Compliance Against Drug Diversion Act of 
2021’’. 
SEC. 2. MODIFICATION, TRANSFER, AND TERMI-
NATION OF REGISTRATION TO MAN-
UFACTURE, 
DISTRIBUTE, 
OR 
DIS-
PENSE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. 
Subsection (a) of section 302 of the Con-
trolled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 822) is 
amended by adding at the end the following 
new paragraph: 
‘‘(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph 
(C), the registration of any registrant under 
this title to manufacture, distribute, or dis-
pense controlled substances or list I chemi-
cals terminates if and when such reg-
istrant— 
‘‘(i) dies; 
‘‘(ii) ceases legal existence; 
‘‘(iii) discontinues business or professional 
practice; or 
‘‘(iv) surrenders such registration. 
‘‘(B) In the case of such a registrant who 
ceases legal existence or discontinues busi-
ness or professional practice, such registrant 
shall promptly notify the Attorney General 
in writing of such fact. 
‘‘(C) No registration under this title to 
manufacture, distribute, or dispense con-
trolled substances or list I chemicals, and no 
authority conferred thereby, may be as-
signed or otherwise transferred except upon 
such conditions as the Attorney General 
may specify and then only pursuant to writ-
ten consent. A registrant to whom a reg-
istration is assigned or transferred pursuant 
to the preceding sentence may not manufac-
ture, distribute, or dispense controlled sub-
stances or list I chemicals pursuant to such 
registration until the Attorney General re-
ceives such written consent. 
‘‘(D) In the case of a registrant under this 
title to manufacture, distribute, or dispense 
controlled substances or list I chemicals de-
siring to discontinue business or professional 
practice altogether or with respect to con-
trolled substances and list I chemicals (with-
out assigning or transferring such business 
or professional practice to another entity), 
such registrant shall return to the Attorney 
General for cancellation— 
‘‘(i) the registrant’s certificate of registra-
tion; 
‘‘(ii) any unexecuted order forms in the 
registrant’s possession; and 
‘‘(iii) any other documentation that the 
Attorney General may require.’’.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1899. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1899, the Ensuring Compli-
ance Against Drug Diversion Act. 
The Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion is charged with regulating con-
trolled substances and manages access 
to these substances through a registra-
tion system. This system is meant to 
identify entities that manufacture, dis-
tribute, and dispense controlled sub-
stances, such as opioids; as well as to 
prevent diversion of these substances. 
We rely on the DEA to maintain the in-
tegrity of this system as one way to 
stop illicit diversion before it starts. 
However, a 2018 Government Ac-
countability Office report found over 
700 registrants in the DEA’s system 
may have been ineligible for registra-
tion under the Controlled Substances 
Act. In fact, the GAO found that some 
of these registrants were reportedly de-
ceased, did not possess State-level au-
thority, or were incarcerated for of-
fenses related to controlled substances. 
If we are to curb rising substance 
abuse in the U.S., we must ensure, 
Madam Speaker, that bad actors are 
prevented from having access to these 
substances. The legislation we are con-
sidering today would terminate the

controlled substance registration of 
any registrant if the registrant dies, 
ceases legal existence, discontinues 
business or professional practice, or 
surrenders their registration. This bill 
also codifies DEA authority to ensure 
accuracy of registrations and limit the 
transfer of such registrations. 
I thank the lead sponsor of this bill, 
Representative GRIFFITH, for his lead-
ership on this issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of this legislation, which was in-
troduced by Representative GRIFFITH. 
In order to prevent people who have 
not been vetted by authorities in dis-
pensing controlled substances, this bill 
would clarify that the transfer of any 
controlled substance registration with-
out written consent from the Drug En-
forcement 
Administration, 
DEA, 
is 
prohibited. 
A 2018 Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee report, which summarized the 
committee’s bipartisan investigation 
into the distribution of prescription 
opioids by wholesale drug distributors, 
and the DEA’s subsequent enforcement 
practices found that an opioid dis-
tributor and its pharmacy customer 
did not go through the appropriate 
process of transferring a registration 
to a new pharmacy owner. 
Failing to contact the DEA appro-
priately and to verify whether the 
agency approved the transfer of a reg-
istration to dispense controlled sub-
stances creates a serious risk that 
could lead to drug diversion. 
Madam Speaker, of course, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH). 
b 1415 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 1899, the 
Ensuring Compliance Against Drug Di-
version Act. This is a small but very 
important step that could play a key 
role in helping contain the opioid epi-
demic. 
License to distribute opioids is not a 
commodity to be freely bought and 
sold. We must ensure that those who 
wish to engage in opioid distribution 
earn the ability to do so. 
An investigation, as the Speaker has 
heard, published by the Energy and 
Commerce Oversight and Investiga-
tions Subcommittee in 2018 found that 
the current procedures for transferring 
the licenses to distribute controlled 
substances lacked sufficient account-
ability. 
In one instance, a distributor and its 
pharmacy customer did not go through 
the appropriate process of transferring 
registration to a new pharmacy owner, 
but the mistake wasn’t caught until 
long, long afterward. As a result, there 
was a period of time during which the 
DEA was unaware that a particular 
pharmacy was distributing controlled 
substances. 
Failing to properly verify whether a 
transfer has been approved creates a 
serious risk of drug diversion. This bill 
amends the Controlled Substances Act 
to prohibit the transfer of any DEA 
registration without consent from the 
agency. 
By requiring written approval from 
the DEA before the transfer of registra-
tion, we decrease the risk of controlled 
substances falling into the hands of 
those who have not been vetted by ap-
propriate regulatory authorities. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
urge passage of this very good bill. I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
also urge support for the bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1899. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

er, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the bill before us today, H.R. 1502, the 
Microloan Improvement Act of 2021. 
Today, we are considering four bipar-
tisan bills that were approved by the 
Small Business Committee and the full 
House of Representatives last year. I 
am proud of the committee’s work on 
behalf of small businesses and pleased 
that we worked together to get things 
done. Our small businesses deserve 
nothing less. 
I would like to thank the chair-
woman, Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ, for giving me 
the opportunity to manage time today 
on these four important small business 
bills. 
I would also like to thank the rank-
ing member, Mr. LUETKEMEYER, who 
will be handling the floor proceedings 
today with me. 
Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
Subcommittee on Economic Growth, 
Tax, and Capital Access, under the 
leadership of Mr. KIM, held a hearing 
on the microloan program, where we 
heard from a panel of intermediaries 
who reported that many of the pro-
gram’s rules, largely unchanged since 
1991, are outdated and restrict them 
from meeting today’s demand for start- 
up financing and providing more tech-
nical assistance. 
In response, Mr. KIM
crafted the 
Microloan Improvement Act of 2020, a 
series of proposals designed to update 
the program’s rules and, ultimately, 
help microloan intermediaries extend 
more affordable capital to first-time 
entrepreneurs. 
I was proud to support the Microloan 
Improvement Act last Congress and 
was pleased to see some of its provi-
sions become law as part of the Eco-
nomic Aid Act last December. 
Today’s bill, the Microloan Improve-
ment Act of 2021, is virtually the same 
as last Congress’ version without the 
policies we have already enacted into 
law. 
Madam Speaker, we have heard time 
and again many entrepreneurs lack the 
experience needed to demonstrate their 
creditworthiness to conventional lend-
ers. The COVID–19 pandemic has high-
lighted these gaps in financing, show-
ing the smallest of small businesses, 
especially those owned by women and 
minorities, struggle the most to afford 
access to capital. 
The microloan program is uniquely 
suited to address this problem, and to-
day’s bill strengthens the program and 
is long overdue. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume, and I rise in support of H.R. 
1502, the Microloan Improvement Act 
of 2021. 
Before I begin, I would like to thank 
the chairwoman for working in a bipar-
tisan manner on behalf of our Nation’s 
small businesses. 
The bills before us today were devel-
oped in the 116th Congress and have 
been updated and reintroduced in this 
Congress. They focus on the Small 
Business 
Administration’s 
existing 
government guaranteed loan programs. 
These programs are important re-
sources and tools for the Nation’s 
smallest businesses as they seek out fi-
nancing. 
Now, more than ever, these programs 
need to be ready for small businesses as 
they begin and continue to recover 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. As rank-
ing member of the Committee on Small 
Business, I want to make sure we 
focus, or continue to focus on these 
programs 
that 
assist 
the 
Nation’s 
small businesses, entrepreneurs, and 
start-ups. 
The first bill is the Microloan Im-
provement Act. This legislation en-
hances and expands SBA’s microloan 
program which provides loans of $50,000 
or less. This program, which is deliv-
ered to small businesses through a 
partnership 
with 
microloan 
inter-
mediaries, concentrates on low-dollar 
loans and technical assistance. 
When a small business is starting 
out, counseling and capital assistance 
are true drivers of continued and pro-
longed success. H.R. 1502 further en-
hances the program for micro-bor-
rowers by expanding the repayment 
terms of the program and providing ad-
ditional tools in their toolbox. 
Additionally, the bill removes the 
burdensome 1/55th rule that delays dol-
lars from flowing to microloan inter-
mediaries within the first two fiscal 
quarters of the year and replaces it 
with an allocation mechanism that will 
provide more equitable access to all 
States across the Nation. 
I would like to thank Mr. KIM, Mr. 
GARBARINO, 
Ms. 
NEWMAN, 
and 
Mr. 
BURCHETT for concentrating their ef-
forts on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1502, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. NEW-
MAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today, excitedly, on behalf of the 
millions of small businesses across our 
Nation that are truly suffering from 
the pandemic and struggling to keep 
their doors open because support is 
simply not reaching them. 
As a former small business owner, I 
know firsthand how loans can make an 
absolutely life-changing difference for 
an entrepreneur. 
However, the reality is that too 
many 
small 
businesses, 
especially 
those led by women, or minorities, or 
those in rural communities, don’t have 
access to the primary lending programs 
offered by the Small Business Adminis-
tration or private sector. 
Microloans 
are 
designed 
to 
help 
start-ups and new small businesses 
that don’t have banking relationships 
with access to larger capital. But for 
too many businesses, these microloans 
have been unreachable. 
That is why I am proud to co-lead the 
Microloan Improvement Act to ensure 
that, regardless of background or loca-
tion, every business has equitable ac-
cess to capital. 
With this legislation, we are expand-
ing the number of community-based 
lenders eligible for the lowest interest 
rates on loans. That means these lend-
ers can offer lines of credit to more 
small businesses. 
Now more than ever, we have an obli-
gation to remove barriers that prevent 
small 
businesses 
from 
receiving 
microloans. With this legislation, we 
are cutting bureaucratic red tape that 
has restricted growth and job creation. 
From mom-and-pop shops, to family- 
owned stores, to every small business, 
they will all benefit. That is why this 
legislation is supported by Democrats 
and Republicans, and I am so glad to 
partner today with my Republican col-
leagues. I am happy to work in a bipar-
tisan 
fashion 
to 
help 
our 
inter-
mediaries provide assistance to our 
local entrepreneurs. 
Let’s pass this legislation so we can 
support the smallest of the small busi-
nesses in all of our communities. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Tennessee 
(Mr. BURCHETT), who has been a leader 
in small business issues. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing. 
I rise in support of Representative 
KIM’s Microloan Improvement Act. I 
am proud to be an original cosponsor of 
this important legislation. 
Access to financial capital is essen-
tial to the success of America’s small 
businesses and their entrepreneurs. 
This bipartisan bill is straightforward 
and effective. It increases the number 
of nonprofit community-based lenders 
that can offer loans through the SBA’s 
microloan program. 
Representative KIM’s bill works in 
tandem with the Microloan Trans-
parency and Accountability Act, my 
small business legislation that we will 
debate shortly, to expand access to fi-
nancial resources that will help our as-
piring small business owners and entre-
preneurs chase down the American 
Dream.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1767 
April 14, 2021 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this important bipartisan legislation. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers and I am prepared 
to close. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Madam Speaker, 2020 was a difficult 
year for small businesses. The COVID– 
19 pandemic hit small businesses hard. 
This is especially true for small busi-
nesses that were just starting out. 
As our country continues to recover, 
the SBA’s programs and resources 
must be ready to assist the Nation’s 
job creators along the way. 
The microloan program is a key tool 
for many small business owners. The 
reforms in H.R. 1502 are commonsense 
improvements that will continue to 
provide assistance and resources to 
America’s Main Street businesses. 
Madam Speaker, I urge and rec-
ommend my colleagues to support H.R. 
1502, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
b 1430 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
As the small business economy starts 
to recover from the COVID–19 pan-
demic, entrepreneurs will need as many 
affordable capital options as possible. 
That is why the Economic Aid Act in-
cluded PPP updates, grants for hard- 
hit venues, and other enhancements to 
SBA’s business loan programs, includ-
ing the microloan program. 
Today’s bill takes the next step after 
that relief effort toward fully modern-
izing and optimizing SBA’s microloan 
program. For nearly 30 years, this pro-
gram has had a strong track record of 
success and has helped to launch many 
successful small businesses, especially 
those owned by women and minority 
entrepreneurs. The record is full of suc-
cess stories as the program has grown 
from a simple pilot program to a vital 
lending tool with strong stakeholder 
and congressional support. 
The legislation before us today re-
news our commitment to startups by 
easing access to the program for even 
more aspiring entrepreneurs and mak-
ing the program nimbler for inter-
mediaries and borrowers alike. 
Passing this bill will be another step 
to help lead our Nation out of this pan-
demic and build back the economy by 
embracing America’s entrepreneurial 
spirit. 
I applaud the work by Mr. KIM and 
Mr. GARBARINO
for their bipartisan 
work on the microloan program. I en-
courage all of my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. 
CRAIG) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1502. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the bill before us today, H.R. 1487, the 
Microloan Transparency and Account-
ability Act, which will improve SBA’s 
data reporting with respect to the 
microloan program. 
Specifically, the bill would have SBA 
and microlenders report on the num-
ber, 
amount, 
and 
percentage 
of 
microloans that went into default in 
the previous year; the extent to which 
microloans are provided to small busi-
nesses in rural areas; and the average 
size, interest rate, and amount of fees 
charged for each microloan. 
These metrics will help Congress and 
the public better evaluate the program 
and its impact on underserved commu-
nities and make improvements as need-
ed. 
This program is vital in helping 
women and minorities obtain much- 
needed capital. In fiscal year 2020, 47 
percent of microloans were made to 
women-owned small businesses, and 
more than 51 percent of microloans 
were made to minority-owned small 
businesses. 
This language was approved unani-
mously last Congress by both the 
Small Business Committee and the full 
House, and I look forward to a similar 
vote here today. 
The version of the bill from last Con-
gress also included a provision that 
would increase the amount of technical 
assistance grant funding a rural-serv-
ing microlender would receive. I am

pleased that language was included as 
part of the Economic Aid Act and is 
now law. 
However, our work on the microloan 
program is not done. H.R. 1487 con-
tinues the work to keep strengthening 
the program, and I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support it. 
I applaud the bipartisanship shown 
by the sponsors of these bills, espe-
cially the leads, Mr. BURCHETT and Mr. 
KIM. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1487, the Microloan Transparency 
and Accountability Act of 2021. 
I thank the chair for moving these 
bills quickly to the House floor. I also 
want to commend the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT), the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD), the gentleman from New Jer-
sey (Mr. KIM), and the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN) for working 
diligently and in a bipartisan fashion 
on behalf of America’s small busi-
nesses. 
It is important to note that once 
Congress creates a Federal Government 
program, tool, or resource, the work is 
not done. Members of Congress must 
examine and determine the effective-
ness and efficiency of the programs in 
practice to ensure that they are meet-
ing congressional intent. 
H.R. 1487 does just this for the 
microloan program, which delivers cap-
ital assistance and counseling to our 
Nation’s smallest businesses. Often-
times, businesses that are just starting 
out and taking their first steps as a 
company 
are 
participants 
in 
the 
microloan program. 
On an annual basis, the Small Busi-
ness Administration will be required to 
report to Congress on the microloan 
program’s default rates, an analysis of 
credit requirements, the extent and 
reach of the program in rural areas, 
and so on. 
H.R. 1487 will also increase trans-
parency and provide Congress with 
tools to ensure it is working on behalf 
of small businesses across the Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
commonsense and straightforward leg-
islation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield as much time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Tennessee 
(Mr. BURCHETT), a distinguished gen-
tleman who has worked hard on a lot of 
small business issues. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
the Microloan Transparency and Ac-
countability Act is important bipar-
tisan legislation that gives all entre-
preneurs fair access to the Small Busi-
ness Administration’s microloan pro-
gram. 
As a former small business owner, I 
know accessible financial resources are 
important for growth, innovation, and 
success. Working folks have to jump on 
the first horse that comes down the 
pike, as my dad used to say, or need to 
dip into personal savings, like I did. 
Wealthy folks have family assets. Inner 
cities and rural Appalachia don’t have 
those 
same 
opportunities, 
Madam 
Speaker. These are hardworking Amer-
icans just looking to get their foot in 
the door and to have a fair shot. 
This legislation aims to boost rural 
small business participation in the 
SBA microloan program by requiring 
the Small Business Administration to 
submit to Congress a financial analysis 
of the microloan program. This ensures 
Federal microloans are targeted to-
ward rural areas, not just large urban 
centers, and creates important over-
sight that reduces fraud and govern-
ment waste. 
These fixes will allow America’s en-
trepreneurs, regardless of background 
or location, to have easier access to 
capital that helps them reach their 
goals. 
I am proud to partner with Rep-
resentatives ANDY
KIM, SCOTT
FITZ-
GERALD, and MARIE NEWMAN on this 
legislation that will make a difference 
for 
east 
Tennessee’s 
mom-and-pop 
shops and small businesses across our 
great country. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield as much time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Wisconsin 
(Mr. FITZGERALD), a huge supporter of 
small businesses and all their issues. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 1487. 
Unlike large businesses with access 
to debt and equity markets, small busi-
nesses rely on commercial banking to 
fund their operations. Should a credit-
worthy small business be unable to ob-
tain a conventional business loan, the 
Small Business Administration can 
help the small business by offering ac-
cess to capital through the microloan 
program. The microloan program al-
lows nonprofit intermediaries to make 
loans of up to $50,000 to small busi-
nesses, along with technical assistance. 
The program has grown from approv-
ing $52 million in loans in 2015 to over 
$80 million in 2019. Despite this growth, 
the SBA produces minimal statistics 
that are needed to evaluate a govern-
ment guarantee loan program. 
This commonsense legislation will 
require the SBA to produce an annual 
report detailing additional information 
about microloans that have defaulted 
and the number of loans provided to 
rural areas. 
We owe it to Americans to conduct 
basic oversight to protect their tax-
payer dollars while expanding opportu-
nities for rural small businesses to 
grow and innovate. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill to en-
sure small businesses hit hard by the 
pandemic have robust access to capital, 
regardless of their size and location. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared 
to close. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
The microloan program, which deliv-
ers capital assistance to the Nation’s 
smallest businesses, is an important 
lending tool at the SBA. H.R. 1487, the 
Microloan Transparency and Account-
ability Act of 2021, will deliver com-
prehensive data and information on the 
effectiveness of the program. 
I applaud all of the Members working 
on this important legislation in an ef-
fort to shine more light on how well 
the program is working. 
From my State of Missouri to both of 
the Nation’s coasts, accessing capital 
remains a top challenge facing all 
small businesses. Tools and resources 
like the microloan program can make 
a huge difference to small business 
owners in the early stages of their 
businesses. We must ensure these pro-
grams and tools are operating at a high 
level and delivering on the goals that 
Congress set for them. That is why this 
bill is so important. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
1487, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
It is often said that information is 
power. H.R. 1487 will greatly increase 
the 
information 
publicly 
available 
about the microloan program’s per-
formance and impact. 
If we intend to continue to support 
the smallest of small businesses, we 
need to make sure the programs tar-
geting them are operating at their 
best. That starts with improving the 
data and information available about 
where the loans are going, how afford-
able they are, and where the gaps in 
coverage are. 
With more data, the public can assess 
the impact these loans have in our 
communities, and Congress will be able 
to monitor the program and identify 
areas for improvement. 
I thank the gentlemen from Ten-
nessee and New Jersey for their hard 
work and collaboration in bringing this 
bill to the floor today. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Kansas (Ms. DAVIDS) and the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Kansas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Kansas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the bill before us today, H.R. 1490, the 
504 Modernization and Small Manufac-
turer Enhancement Act of 2021. 
504 loans are an important SBA cap-
ital access product, allowing small 
businesses to affordably purchase ma-
chinery and equipment, acquire real es-
tate, or take on other fixed asset costs. 
The loan has a three-party structure 
where an SBA-backed 504 lender pro-
vides 40 percent of the financing, a 
third-party lender provides 50 percent 
of the financing, and a small business 
borrower provides 10 percent. This 
unique structure has helped thousands 
of entrepreneurs expand their busi-
nesses and hire more employees, espe-
cially businesses with significant fixed 
costs. 
Last Congress, the Committee on 
Small 
Business’s 
Subcommittee 
on 
Oversight, Investigations, and Regula-
tions held a hearing to review the cur-
rent status of the 504 loan program. We 
heard from a panel of 504 lenders who 
reported concerns with the loan closing 
process, specifically that closing delays 
have caused loans to fall through and 
businesses to lose out on affordable fi-
nancing. 
To that end, Ms. CRAIG put forth a 
strong proposal to streamline the 504 
loan closing process and make compli-
ance easier for CDCs, borrowers, and 
third-party lenders, who are essential 
to the 504 loan structure. 
Two of the provisions of that bill, 
which passed unanimously through our 
committee and the House, were also in-
cluded in the Economic Aid Act that 
was enacted in December.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1771 
April 14, 2021 
The version of the bill before us 
today is identical to the version we 
passed last Congress, but for those pro-
visions included in the Economic Aid 
Act. 
The 
changes 
under 
consideration 
today continue to address the issues we 
have heard in our engagement with 504 
lenders and their borrowers in our dis-
tricts, and I am pleased we are taking 
a vote on them today. 
b 1445 
These include increasing the max-
imum loan size for small manufactur-
ers from $5.5 million to $6.5 million and 
easing the job retention or creation re-
quirement for them, which helps make 
504 loans easier to access. 
We should be doing everything that 
we can to make navigating and uti-
lizing this program as simple as pos-
sible. As a member of the Small Busi-
ness Committee, I am committed to 
helping our small businesses and manu-
facturers weather this current crisis 
and to helping Main Street come back 
even stronger. 
It is why I fought to secure $10 bil-
lion for the Defense Production Act in 
the American Rescue Plan Act to ramp 
up domestic production of PPE and 
other critical supplies. It is also why I 
introduced the SUPPLIES Act, which 
would promote the manufacturing of 
PPE and medical supplies by small 
businesses here in the U.S. I am proud 
to be a cosponsor of the bill to help 
small businesses and manufacturers so 
they can help us. 
I want to thank the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota and the gentlewoman 
from California for their hard work, 
and I applaud their efforts to make bi-
partisan improvements to this valuable 
program. 
I recommend a ‘‘yes’’ vote to all my 
colleagues in the House. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1490, the 504 Modernization and 
Small Manufacturer Enhancement Act 
of 2021. 
When capital options are limited for 
a small business, the SBA offers nu-
merous lending programs, including 
the 504/Certified Development Com-
pany Loan Program. Also known as a 
504/CDC loan, the program provides 
long-term and fixed-rate financing that 
primarily supports purchases of real es-
tate and machinery. 
Due to the program’s unique cost 
structure that includes a small busi-
ness, a lender, and a certified develop-
ment company, the process is often 
lengthy and cumbersome. H.R. 1490 
takes important steps to streamline 
the closing process and ensures the Na-
tion’s job creators move through the 
program in a smooth and efficient 
manner. 
Additionally, H.R. 1490 enhances the 
504/CDC loan program for America’s 
small manufacturers. By increasing the 
maximum loan amount for small man-
ufacturers, H.R. 1490 ensures these 
small businesses have the capital to ex-
pand and create jobs in Missouri and 
beyond. 
Enhancements to lending resources 
and tools, such as those outlined in 
H.R. 1490, is exactly what our small 
businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups 
need. 
I want to highlight the work of Ms. 
CRAIG from Minnesota, Mrs. KIM from 
California, Mr. CHABOT from Ohio, and 
Ms. DAVIDS from Kansas on this impor-
tant matter. I would also like to thank 
the chairwoman for her efforts as well. 
The changes in H.R. 1490 will improve 
delivery of the 504/CDC loan program 
for all of America’s small businesses. I 
urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
1490. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG). 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, for over 
a year now, small businesses in my dis-
trict and across the country have 
struggled to make it through this pub-
lic health and economic crisis. As a re-
sult of this pandemic, prospective 
small business owners face a steeper 
climb than ever before. 
We must do more to make it easy to 
start, operate, and expand a small busi-
ness in our communities. One of the 
most important ways that we can do 
this is by ensuring that the Small 
Business Administration’s loan pro-
grams are operating as effectively and 
efficiently as possible. 
Today, we have two bills that would 
do exactly that, including my bipar-
tisan bill, the 504 Modernization and 
Small Manufacturer Enhancement Act. 
These crucial bipartisan pieces of legis-
lation will not only increase the 
amount of capital available to manu-
facturers, but will actually ease the 
process of getting a loan because, in 
the midst of a severe economic crisis, 
our businessowners simply cannot be 
bogged down in red tape and legalese. 
Taken together, these bills will help 
to promote the economic development 
of small manufacturers, creating good 
paying jobs in growing industries all 
across this country. 
To demonstrate just how impactful 
these loans can be, I want to tell you 
about Nate Bry, a lifelong resident of 
Rosemount, Minnesota. Thirteen years 
ago, Nate founded a sports apparel 
company called Custom Apparel Inc. in 
the basement of his home. After years 
of hard work, Nate felt that it was fi-
nally time to reach a turning point, 
but he didn’t have the resources he 
needed to take his business to the next 
level. When Nate received a 504 loan, he 
was immediately able to invest in his 
company, building a facility to manu-
facture his products right in his home-
town, creating good–paying jobs in the 
very same community where he grew 
up. 
Nate’s story, like so many others, is 
proof that the 504 loan program can 
change the lives of small business own-
ers in this country. This program en-
sures that small businesses like Nate’s 
are able to succeed, bringing home the 
job growth and economic stability that 
our communities are striving for, espe-
cially as we emerge from this dev-
astating economic crisis. 
Because these are not simply busi-
nesses. These are livelihoods, family 
traditions, and priceless contributions 
to our communities, and we have an 
opportunity to support them on a bi-
partisan basis by taking action today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to come together and join me 
in supporting these bills and businesses 
across our Nation. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM), someone who be-
lieves in cutting red tape to help ease 
the regulatory burden on all our small 
businesses. 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
LUETKEMEYER for his leadership in the 
House Small Business Committee. I 
would also like to extend my special 
thanks to Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ for 
putting forward these very important 
bills. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1490, the 504 Modernization 
and Small Manufacturer Enhancement 
Act of 2021. 
I was proud to join my colleagues, 
Representatives CRAIG, DAVIDS, and 
CHABOT, to introduce this bipartisan 
bill to modernize the SBA’s 504 loan 
program. The program was established 
with the mission to incentivize eco-
nomic growth and job creation by pro-
viding small businesses with affordable 
long-term financing. 
Our bill will provide the SBA with 
the tools to assist small businesses as 
they recover during COVID–19. H.R. 
1490 would expand eligibility of 504 
loans for small businesses that have fo-
cused on workforce development, revi-
talized areas hit hard by the pandemic 
or disaster areas, and implemented en-
ergy-efficient products, or have 10 or 
fewer employees. These additions will 
strengthen the 504 loan program for the 
long run and help small businesses in 
my community access much-needed 
capital. 
The bill will also streamline the clos-
ing process of 504 loans. Specifically, 
H.R. 1490 allows Certified Development 
Companies to rectify documentation 
without the implicit approval of the 
SBA. These corrections will allow 
small businesses to make investments 
in their community or hire more work-
ers without delay. 
Lastly, the bill would support our 
small manufacturers to ensure that our 
community’s manufacturing base re-
mains strong and competitive during 
these difficult times. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support H.R. 1490.

April 14, 2021 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. TENNEY), a small business 
owner herself who knows the impor-
tance of cutting red tape and how it 
can be linked to success of a small 
business. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
and 
Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER
for 
bringing forth this great bipartisan 
bill. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 1490, 
the 504 Modernization and Small Manu-
facturer Enhancement Act. I am proud 
to cosponsor this bill with my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle. 
This bipartisan legislation improves 
the loan guaranty program and helps 
small manufacturers access capital by 
streamlining the loan process and pro-
viding support to manufacturers who 
apply for the loan from local Small 
Business Administration district of-
fices. 
As small businesses across the coun-
try and throughout New York’s 22nd 
District continue to struggle with the 
devastating impacts of COVID–19, we 
must provide targeted support to our 
small businesses and manufacturers, 
and H.R. 1490 does just that. 
This legislation increases the max-
imum loan amount to $6.5 million and 
requires SBA district offices to partner 
with SBA resource partners to provide 
entrepreneurial 
development 
assist-
ance to small manufacturers, which are 
abundant in central New York. 
This bill will also work to lower costs 
and streamline numerous administra-
tive processes for small manufacturers, 
giving these businesses the tools and 
support they need to keep their doors 
open, something that has been said to 
me repeatedly through numerous town-
halls with the small business commu-
nity around the region. 
As a member of the House Small 
Business Committee and, as the rank-
ing member indicated, the owner of a 
small manufacturing facility that is in 
its 75th year in central New York, I am 
pleased to cosponsor H.R. 1490 and the 
other three small business bills on the 
floor today. These four bills will pro-
vide targeted relief to small businesses 
across New York’s 22nd District and 
throughout the Nation. At a time when 
Americans seek true bipartisanship 
from its elected officials, I am honored 
to be part of that effort. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive CRAIG from Minnesota and Rep-
resentative KIM
from California for 
their leadership on this issue. I look 
forward to continuing to work with 
them on this matter. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, we have one more gentleman com-
ing, but there is a long path between 
his office and here. Apparently he is 
not here on time, so I am prepared to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, as our economy con-
tinues to recover and as our small busi-
nesses rebuild, existing Federal Gov-
ernment programs, tools, and resources 
need to be ready to provide assistance. 
Processes that are slow and unwieldy 
must be examined and retooled to en-
sure they are working on behalf of 
small businesses and the American 
public. 
H.R. 1490, the 504 Modernization and 
Small Manufacturer Enhancement Act 
of 2021, takes these steps to streamline 
the program while ensuring it is a via-
ble option for small businesses as they 
recover and grow. 
Additionally, H.R. 1490 places a di-
rect focus on our Nation’s small manu-
facturers. We must continue to work in 
a bipartisan manner to ensure these 
programs are ready for recovery. 
With that, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 1490. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the SBA’s 504 loan 
program has made a significant impact 
on our Main Streets in its 62-year his-
tory. 
In addition to partnering with banks 
to extend affordable fixed-asset capital, 
most CDCs in the program are also ac-
tively involved in promoting local eco-
nomic development, especially for un-
derserved business communities. 
I am proud of the opportunity we 
have today to continue supporting the 
work of CDCs. I want to applaud the 
work by the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota, the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia, and their bipartisan effort on 
the 504 program. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. DA-
VIDS) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 1490. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

504 CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2021 
Ms. 
DAVIDS

the Small Business Act to enhance the

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the bill before us today, H.R. 1482, the 
504 Credit Risk Management Improve-
ment Act, which clarifies the oversight 
role of the SBA’s Office of Credit Risk 
Management in respect to CDCs. 
To improve oversight of the SBA 
business loan programs, including the 
7(a) and 504 loan programs, the agency 
established the Office of Credit Risk 
Management—OCRM—within the Of-
fice of Capital Access. OCRM conducts 
periodic reviews of SBA lenders to en-
sure they are complying with program 
requirements. 
In 2018, Congress passed bipartisan 
legislation to codify the office and gave 
it the tools it needs to conduct proper 
oversight and hold noncompliant lend-
ers accountable. 
It was our intent to boost the office’s 
enforcement powers to help minimize 
the likelihood that business loan pro-
grams would face losses and reduce the 
need for Congress to appropriate funds. 
I should point out that these pro-
grams are designed to operate at zero 
subsidy, meaning they come at no cost 
to the taxpayer, and we intend to keep 
it that way. 
I am pleased that the gentleman 
from North Carolina, along with the 
gentlewoman from Minnesota, worked 
together to bring this bill to life last 
Congress. This bill clarifies OCRM’s 
oversight role and shifts loan closing 
file review responsibilities to the office 
and, in turn, keeps the program run-
ning at a zero subsidy. I applaud their 
bipartisanship and, more importantly, 
their commitment to America’s small 
businesses. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 1482, the 504 
Credit Risk Management Improvement 
Act of 2021. 
I thank the chair again for advancing 
all these bills that are meant to assist 
small businesses across the Nation. I 
also thank the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP), the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. KIM), the 
gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. DA-
VIDS), the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. CRAIG), as well as the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) for 
working in a bipartisan manner to 
strengthen the 504/CDC loan program. 
Government 
programs, 
especially 
government guaranteed loan programs, 
are only as strong as the oversight that 
is required. 
In order to protect and safeguard 
American tax dollars, executive branch 
agencies must have a watchful eye fo-
cused on these programs. 
The Office of Credit Risk Manage-
ment is a division at the Small Busi-
ness Administration that is charged 
with overseeing many of the govern-
ment 
guaranteed 
lending 
programs 
that the SBA offers to small busi-
nesses. H.R. 1482 ensures the Office of 
Credit Risk Management has a trained 
eye focused on the 504/CDC loan pro-
gram. 
Specifically, the legislation outlines 
how the office should conduct reviews 
under the lending program. 
Additionally, H.R. 1482 details the en-
forcement authority of the Office of 
Credit Risk Management. These en-
hancements will ensure the program 
operates effectively and efficiently into 
the future. 
Lastly, the bill requires the SBA to 
clearly and concisely define how the 
504/CDC loan program operates in con-
junction with the Nation’s environ-
mental laws and rules. Unfortunately, 
this process currently lacks certainty 
by the SBA. 
Simply put, Federal Government pro-
grams require robust oversight and the

programs must have clear rules for 
small businesses. H.R. 1482 addresses 
both of these issues head on. 
Madam Speaker, I urge and rec-
ommend all my colleagues to support 
H.R. 1482, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
CHABOT), the former chairman of the 
Small Business Committee. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1482. 
I thank my colleague from Min-
nesota, Representative ANGIE
CRAIG, 
for working with me on this bipartisan 
bill. 
I also thank the other cosponsors, 
Representatives SHARICE
DAVIDS
and 
YOUNG KIM, for their work; as well as 
the full chair of the committee, Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, who I worked with many 
years either with myself as chair and 
she as ranking, or her as chair and my-
self as ranking. 
I thank Mr. LUETKEMEYER for the 
great job he is doing. At this point he 
is the ranking member of the com-
mittee. Hopefully he will be chair next 
time, depending on what the American 
people think a year and a half down the 
road. 
So what does this legislation do? 
A number of things. It streamlines 
the 504 loan closing process, clarifies 
the loan closing and oversight process, 
and enhances the program for small 
manufacturers. And small manufactur-
ers are absolutely critical in the econ-
omy nowadays. And we were actually 
making great strides in bringing back 
more and more jobs there until COVID 
hit. So that is why programs like this 
are so important to give them the as-
sistance that they need to get those 
jobs growing once again in that sector 
of the economy. 
The 504 program has been one of the 
more successful of the SBA—the Small 
Business 
Administration—loan 
pro-
grams over the years, and it is really 
crucial as we recover from COVID- 
caused hardships of the past year. 
The SBA CDC/504 loan program pro-
vides the Nation’s smallest businesses 
with long-term and fixed-rate financ-
ing. Importantly, it requires that cer-
tain economic development criteria are 
in place to qualify for the program. 
And job creation and job retention are 
critical goals of the program. 
This bill passed the House last De-
cember in the previous Congress, and I 
am happy to see it on the floor again 
this Congress. Hopefully we will get 
this bill signed into law this time and 
help provide small businesses with the 
support they need to recover from the 
pandemic, and hopefully we will be 
looking at the pandemic in the rear-
view mirror sooner rather than later. 
I thank the Small Business Com-
mittee for the great work they are 
doing on behalf of America’s small 
businesses. It is one of those commit-
tees that really does work in a bipar-
tisan manner, Republicans and Demo-
crats working together, and that is ab-
solutely critical if we are going to get 
anything done. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM), a really hard worker 
and a big supporter of small businesses 
around this country. 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
LUETKEMEYER for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 1482, 
the 504 Credit Risk Management Im-
provement Act of 2021. 
I am proud to have joined my col-
leagues, Representatives ANGIE CRAIG, 
DAN BISHOP, and SHARICE DAVIDS, to in-
troduce this important bipartisan bill. 
The Small Business Administration’s 
504 loan program provides small busi-
nesses with affordable long-term fi-
nancing to purchase major fixed assets, 
such as machinery and real estate. 
This bill would ensure that our tax-
payers’ hard-earned dollars are spent 
effectively by enhancing oversight re-
sponsibilities of the SBA Office of 
Credit Risk Management. 
Our bill will provide the SBA with 
the tools to enforce penalties for any 
violation of rules and regulations. By 
providing the SBA with these tools, we 
look to strengthen the 504 loan pro-
gram for many years to come. 
Additionally, this bill provides con-
sistent and clear guidance when requir-
ing 
certain 
environmental 
certifi-
cations. This change will provide small 
businesses with certainty about re-
quirements and uniform regulations 
across the country. 
For any Federal program to be suc-
cessful, Congress and the executive 
branch must work together to ensure 
that we have a regulatory framework 
that is efficient and able to prevent 
fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. I 
commend my colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle for their leadership on 
this important issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support H.R. 1482. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
I rise in support of my legislation, 
the 504 Credit Risk Management Im-
provement Act of 2021. 
As you may remember, this exact bill 
passed unanimously last December, 
and I hope the commonsense measure 
can pass overwhelmingly again. 
For those who do not know about the 
504 program, this was one of the first 
programs established at the Small 
Business Administration and has been 
a key tool for economic development. 
To receive financing, 504 loan recipi-
ents must create jobs or meet public 
policy goals, like aiding rural develop-
ment or revitalizing a business district. 
In its economic development role, 
the 504 program has provided access to 
capital and helped build communities 
across the country for over six decades. 
To ensure the program’s continued 
success and viability for years to come, 
I partnered with Representative ANGIE 
CRAIG to craft a bill that provides the 
SBA with the tools necessary to main-
tain the long-term health of the 504 
program. 
This bill codifies the SBA’s oversight 
responsibilities for the 504 program and 
provides the Office of Credit Risk Man-
agement with full control of the review 
process for certified development com-
panies, known as CDCs, that deliver 
this program. 
The legislation also establishes a for-
mal process of communication between 
the Office of Credit Risk Management 
and CDCs to facilitate reviews to make 
sure the SBA is providing timely feed-
back to CDCs. 
Additionally, 
this 
legislation 
re-
quires the SBA to provide clear direc-
tion to certified development compa-
nies as they navigate environmental 
rules and regulations. 
Finally, this bill will help ensure 
that the program continues to operate 
on the fees built into the program. 
SBA programs, including the 504 pro-
gram, have been at the forefront of eco-
nomic aid to businesses struggling as a 
result of the COVID–19 pandemic. The 
SBA core lending programs will con-
tinue to play a key role in business re-
covery. 
I am proud to do my part to ensure 
the 504 program continues to be a life-
line to businesses and communities 
today and into the future. 
I thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ and 
Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER
for 
their leadership. I thank my colleague, 
Ms. CRAIG, for her partnership on this 
important bill. I also thank Mrs. 
YOUNG KIM, Ms. DAVIDS, Ms. TENNEY, 
and Mr. COHEN for their support of this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers at 
this time, and I am prepared to close. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Oversight of Federal Government 
programs 
is 
paramount 
to 
ensure 
American taxpayer dollars are used 
wisely. H.R. 1482 not only increases the 
oversight capabilities of the SBA over 
the 504/CDC loan program, but also re-
quires clear and concise guidance for 
small business owners moving forward. 
There are sound changes that will im-
prove the program for future 504/CDC 
borrowers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1775 
April 14, 2021 
I applaud all Members for working on 
this legislation and all of the small 
business bills before us today. We must 
continue to put our Nation’s job cre-
ators at the forefront of this economic 
recovery. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to take 
a few moments to make a couple com-
ments here with regard to all the bills 
that we have offered here today. All 
these bills dealt with things that deal 
with oversight. 
We, as legislators in this body, have 
two jobs. One is to provide legislation 
to improve the lives of our businesses 
and the people in this country, protect 
our country. Second is to provide over-
sight over all of the activities that go 
on within the executive branch, as well 
as the judicial branch, to whatever ex-
tent we can. 
In our committee, we oversee the leg-
islation with regard to the Small Busi-
ness Administration, as well as over-
sight of their activities. We have come 
to find over the last several weeks here 
that the inspector general reports that 
the SBA is not being run as well as it 
should. There is fraud rampant in some 
of the programs, which is verified by 
the AG reports. We have a new Admin-
istrator who has got her hands full be-
cause of the lack of knowledge of what 
goes on with all the brand-new things 
going on. 
So we have got a real problem and 
we, as legislators, have got to step up. 
These bills today are just one step in 
the process of providing the kind of 
oversight that it takes. We will con-
tinue to provide oversight, I can assure 
you. And those listening and watching 
today need to take heart in the fact 
that we are going to continue to pro-
vide the kind of oversight over the 
Small Business Administration and all 
of its programs that we have been 
tasked with and are responsible for. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1482, the last 
bill we will discuss today, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, in its 62-year history, the 
SBA’s 504 loan program has helped 
thousands of entrepreneurs acquire 
heavy machinery and equipment, ex-
pand to more locations, and hire work-
ers. It has long been a strong-per-
forming SBA program and has enjoyed 
consistent bipartisanship support. 
We must continue to take all steps 
needed to preserve the integrity of the 
504 program and ensure it will be an op-
tion for the next generation of entre-
preneurs. Passing the bill before us 
today will help us do so. 
I thank Mr. BISHOP and Ms. CRAIG for 
their hard work and collaboration in 
bringing this bill to the floor today. I 
also thank Mr. LUETKEMEYER for his 
leadership today and his unwavering 
commitment to our Nation’s 30 million 
small businesses. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. DA-
VIDS) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 1482. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

the customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday the Committee on Rules met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
303, providing for consideration of H.R. 
7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, under a 
structured rule. It provides 1 hour of 
debate, equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. It self-executes a 
manager’s amendment from Chairman 
SCOTT and makes in order six amend-
ments to H.R. 7. It also provides for 
one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 1195, the Workplace Vio-
lence Prevention for Health Care and 
Social Service Workers Act, under a 
structured rule. It provides 1 hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor and makes in order 
six amendments to H.R. 1195. It also 
provides for one motion to recommit. 
Finally, the rule provides for an en 
bloc authority to Chairman SCOTT or 
his designee for both bills. 
Madam Speaker, before I begin, I just 
wanted to take a moment—this is the 
first time I have been on the floor since 
we lost Congressman Hastings—to say 
for myself, personally, how much grati-
tude I have for having known him and 
been able to serve with him. I regret 
that I won’t see his smiling face, at 
least in this body, again. 
Madam Speaker, the two bills we are 
talking about today have the potential 
to drastically improve the working 
lives of millions of Americans. 
In 2019, nearly 1 in 9 women in the 
United States lived in poverty, with 
even higher rates for women of color. 
More than 1 in 3 families, headed by 
unmarried mothers, lived in poverty. 
And 60 percent of all poor children 
lived in families headed by unmarried 
mothers. 
The coronavirus pandemic has only 
deepened the divides that already ex-
isted in this country. Women are espe-
cially likely to be on the front lines of 
the pandemic. At the same time, they 
are also being paid less than their male 
counterparts. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
93 
percent 
of 
childcare workers, 66 percent of gro-
cery store cashiers, 70 percent of food 
servers, and 77 percent of clothing, 
shoe stores, and retail salespeople are 
women. 
Women—disproportionately 
Black women and Latinas—make up 
more than 8 in 10 of those working as 
home health aides, personal care aides, 
and nursing assistants. They are also 
at great risk for contracting COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, 6 months ago, deep 
into the pandemic, 1 in 6 Latinas and 1 
in 5 Black women reported not having 
enough food in the previous week, and 
many reported being behind on rent or 
mortgage payments. Even before the 
pandemic, women typically lost more 
than $10,000 every year to the gender 
wage gap, with even higher losses for 
women of color. 
More than five decades after the pas-
sage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, a 
woman in America still makes only 82 
cents on average for every dollar 
earned by her male counterpart. Com-
pared to White men, Black women are 
paid 63 cents. Native Hawaiian and Pa-
cific Islander women are paid 63 cents, 
American Indian or Alaska Native 
women are paid 60 cents and Hispanic 
women are paid 55 cents. 
Based on today’s wage gap, a woman 
who works full time year-round stands 
to lose over $400,000 over a 40-year ca-
reer because of this disparity. This is 
not the United States that Frances 
Perkins, the first woman Secretary, 
envisioned, and we have an opportunity 
today to make a real change. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have 
joined with my very dear friend, Chair-
woman DELAURO, to introduce the Pay-
check Fairness Act, which is an impor-
tant step towards ending gender-based 
wage discrimination and ensuring that 
all women receive equal pay for equal 
work. It is time to make equal pay for 
equal work more than just a slogan and 
turn it into a reality. 
Madam Speaker, we are also here to 
talk about the epidemic of violence 
against healthcare and social service 
workers. Last year, Department of 
Labor statistics show that they were 
nearly five times as likely to suffer a 
serious workplace violence injury than 
workers in other industries. 
The General Accounting Office found 
that 
rates 
of 
violence 
against 
healthcare workers in hospitals, nurs-
ing homes, and residential care facili-
ties is 5 to 12 times higher than the es-
timated rates for workers overall. Be-
tween 2011 and 2016, 58 hospital workers 
died as a result of workplace violence. 
Madam Speaker, for me, this matter 
strikes close to home. In 2010, Napa 
State Hospital technician Donna K. 
Gross was killed outside of Napa State 
Hospital by a patient under psychiatric 
care. Donna was a constituent. She en-
tered the profession to honor her moth-
er, who battled mental illness and was 
a patient at this very same hospital. 
She was the mother of three grown 
children and was raising her grand-
daughter. Her colleagues described her 
by saying: ‘‘First and foremost, Donna 
was a human service-type person and 
loved being with people and working 
with people.’’ 
Donna’s life was cut short when a pa-
tient brutally murdered her to steal 
jewelry and cash. This story is just one 
of thousands, and incidents are on the 
rise. Sadly, violence has become so 
commonplace for healthcare workers 
that they think it is part of their job, 
resulting in only 30 percent of violent 
incidents actually being reported. 
Some States have stepped up to 
enact laws to require employers to es-
tablish a plan to protect against work-
place violence. Donna’s story, for ex-
ample, inspired action in California 
that I was proud to be part of. That ac-
tion in California served as the basis 
for the bill before us tomorrow. 
These workers deserve national ac-
tion, and they deserve it now. At the 
Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration, these workers are not re-
ceiving the urgent attention they need. 
OSHA takes at least 7 years to put 
out a standard. But in some instances, 
it can take more than 20 years. People 
like Donna Kay Gross cannot wait any 
longer. 
To protect the people who dedicate 
their lives to caring for us, we need to 
move now. In truth, we needed to move 
years ago. The longer we wait, the 
more people are suffering. The longer 
we wait, the more people like Donna 
will die. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1530 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Mr. DESAULNIER from 
California for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I first want to ac-
knowledge, 
along 
with 
Mr. 
DESAULNIER, the poignant loss that we 
all feel here in the House with the de-
parture of our friend, Alcee Hastings. 
He was a fixture in the Rules Com-
mittee for all the years I have been on 
the committee. Certainly, while yes-
terday we acknowledged that we feel 
his absence, we also feel his presence. 
He was truly larger than life on the 
committee. 
Today’s rule provides for consider-
ation of two bills that are meant to im-
prove working conditions and com-
pensation. The House actually consid-
ered these same bills last Congress. 
They did not receive consideration in 
the Senate, and I do not believe any 
substance has changed in the under-
lying bills. 
The first bill, H.R. 7, the Paycheck 
Fairness Act, seeks to prevent wage 
discrimination on the basis of sex, a 
fact that is already prohibited under 
current law. This legislation will help 
trial lawyers but offers no new protec-
tions against pay discrimination. 
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits 
all discrimination in pay based upon 
sex or any other non-job-performance- 
related issue. Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act protects against discrimi-
nation based on race, color, national 
origin, religion, and sex. Sex-based 
wage disparity is in direct violation of 
not one but two Federal laws. 
It is important to acknowledge that 
bad actors engage in gender pay dis-
crimination. Their actions are illegal,

and they leave employers vulnerable to 
burdensome lawsuits and heavy fines. 
I could not agree more that such dis-
crimination has no place in any busi-
ness or in society in general. However, 
those who perpetrate these illegal acts 
are the exception and not the rule. 
Congress must not forget the positive 
economic trends that this Nation en-
joyed before the arrival of the novel 
coronavirus in the United States. The 
Trump 
administration 
made 
great 
strides reining in Federal overreach, 
which quickly improved opportunities 
for all Americans. Unemployment was 
at the lowest level in nearly half a cen-
tury, and median wages across all de-
mographic groups rose faster than at 
any other time in American history. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
majority 
has 
crafted legislation that would place 
greater burdens on employers, reduce 
the privacy of employees, and increase 
Federal spending. H.R. 7 does little to 
protect the wages of American workers 
who are experiencing gender pay dis-
crimination. In fact, it makes it harder 
for employers to defend legitimate dif-
ferentials in pay based on factors other 
than sex. 
Currently, employers may pay dif-
ferential wages due to factors other 
than sex, like education, training, or 
experience. This means that all other 
things being equal, a woman cannot be 
paid differently than a man. When an 
employee brings different qualifica-
tions to the job, such as she has an ad-
vanced degree or more experience, the 
factors used to evaluate employee pay 
are no longer equal. This preserves the 
flexibility for employers to make the 
best decision for their businesses, in-
cluding hiring the most qualified indi-
viduals, regardless of sex. 
H.R. 7 would now require that non- 
sex reasons for any wage disparity have 
a business necessity, a term which is 
not defined in the bill. Providing a gen-
der-based business necessity that ac-
counts for the entire differential in pay 
is nearly an impossible standard to de-
fend against. 
This change to a bona fide factor de-
fense does not consider the reality of 
the labor market. Employees are often 
willing to accept lower pay for greater 
control 
over 
their 
work 
location, 
schedule, and vacation time. Studies 
have shown that this is particularly 
true for women. 
With the threat of lawsuits hanging 
over the heads of employers, they are 
less likely to allow for flexibility in 
the workplace. Instead of allowing em-
ployees to negotiate their own pay and 
work arrangements, employers will be 
incentivized to transform jobs that 
were once negotiable and flexible into 
jobs that are much more rigid. 
H.R. 7 also limits an employer’s abil-
ity to pay its employees based on per-
formance. If a woman were to earn a 
performance-based bonus or salary in-
crease that her male coworker did not 
receive, then that man could file suit 
against the employer on the basis that 
the bonus is not a business necessity 
due to the vagueness in terms in H.R. 7. 
With this threat in mind, employers 
are much less likely to use perform-
ance-based pay and bonuses, despite 
studies showing that such pay models 
actually do increase employee produc-
tivity. 
While legitimate claims do exist, and 
I hope that all employees who have ex-
perienced discrimination do seek legal 
remedy, the changes in H.R. 7 would 
significantly increase the size and prof-
itability of lawsuits, making nonmeri-
torious claims even more likely for 
trial lawyers looking for new cash 
flows. That is the inherent danger. 
H.R. 7 also requires employers to pro-
vide disaggregated employee informa-
tion to the Department of Labor with-
out delineating mechanisms to keep 
that information safe. Have we ever 
heard that the Federal Government has 
lost employee data or that the Federal 
Government may not be the best stew-
ard of citizens’ private information? 
Maybe we should limit the data re-
ceived until those capabilities are, in 
fact, improved and verified. 
The second bill included in this rule, 
H.R. 1195, requires that the Secretary 
of Labor issue a rule on workplace vio-
lence prevention in the healthcare and 
social service sectors. Some may be 
surprised to hear that acts of violence 
are the third leading cause of fatal oc-
cupational injuries. Of these incidents, 
approximately 8 percent were inten-
tionally caused by another person. 
When Americans go to work each 
day, they do not expect to face violence 
or other harm. This risk is especially 
high for healthcare providers and so-
cial workers. These caregivers can be 
subject to patients who may not be in 
control when under the influence of 
medication or may have some other 
mental stress, upset family members, 
ongoing domestic disputes, and, unfor-
tunately, even gang violence. 
The rate of workplace violence re-
sulting in days away from work for 
healthcare providers is, on average, 
four times higher than for other profes-
sions. In addition, healthcare providers 
and social workers are less likely to re-
port incidents. This may be partly due 
to the pledge to do no harm and the in-
clination to forgive patient-caused in-
juries as accidental. Regardless of the 
situation, all workers deserve a safe 
workplace. 
Currently, there is no mandatory 
standard on workplace violence preven-
tion. However, in 2015, the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administra-
tion 
published 
guidelines 
for 
pre-
venting 
workplace 
violence 
for 
healthcare and social service workers 
and is currently working on a rule for 
workplace violence prevention. 
H.R. 1195 would require the Secretary 
of Labor to issue a rule on workplace 
violence prevention based upon OSHA’s 
2015 guidelines. An interim standard is 
required within 1 year, and a final rule 
must be issued within 2 years. 
While the goal of this legislation is 
very important, the timeframe im-
posed on the Department of Labor and 
OSHA does exceed the norm. While no 
one believes that we should continue to 
delay worker protections, OSHA has al-
ready begun the rulemaking process 
and is gathering stakeholder input. 
Perhaps, rather than pass a bill to re-
quire the issuance of a rule, we should 
be considering reforms to the entire 
OSHA rulemaking process. In other 
words, let’s improve the bureaucracy 
rather than simply flogging it. 
While an OSHA rulemaking would 
ensure enforcement of workplace vio-
lence prevention policies, according to 
a 2018 American Hospital Association 
survey, 97 percent of respondents re-
ported they already have a workplace 
violence prevention policy in place. In 
2019, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention stated that additional 
research was required to identify effec-
tive strategies to prevent violence, par-
ticularly in healthcare settings. 
We can all agree that there is a need 
for OSHA to do its work to issue a 
workplace violence prevention regula-
tion to protect healthcare providers 
and social service workers. I hope we 
are able to accomplish this goal, but I 
do worry that we are placing another 
costly burden on entities through what 
is supposed to be an expedited process 
that may require modification in the 
future to ensure an effective and safe 
workplace for all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the 
distinguished chair of the Rules Com-
mittee and representative of the beau-
tiful city of Worcester, Massachusetts. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from California, a 
distinguished member of the Rules 
Committee and also a graduate of the 
College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, 
for yielding me the time. 
Madam Speaker, I support this rule 
and the underlying legislation, and I 
urge my colleagues on both sides to do 
the same. I hope they all will vote for 
the rule. 
The two bills that we are bringing to 
the floor are the product of regular 
order. They went through the com-
mittee process, hearings and markups. 
We, in the Rules Committee, made 
the Republican substitutes in order so 
they can try to defend their ideas, 
which I don’t agree with. Nonetheless, 
other 
Republican 
amendments 
are 
made in order as well. But then again, 
I guess there is not much we can do to 
make some of my friends happy. 
Madam Speaker, I rise for a more 
somber purpose, and that is to honor 
my friend and colleague, Congressman 
ALCEE HASTINGS, who we lost last week 
after a courageous battle with cancer. I 
am proud to have sat side-by-side with 
him in the Rules Committee for many 
years. 
I often say that the Rules Committee 
is like a family. To those outsiders who

are observing the Rules Committee, we 
can sometimes look a little bit like a 
dysfunctional family, but nonetheless, 
we are a family. Today, our family is in 
mourning. 
This House is already a little less 
joyful and a little less purpose-driven 
without him here. That was the thing 
about ALCEE HASTINGS. Whether he was 
in the majority or the minority, or 
whether he liked what we were consid-
ering on this floor or not, he relished 
his service in this institution. He used 
every day here to wage worthy fights 
on behalf of justice. 
His election marked the first time an 
African American was elected from 
Florida since the Civil War era. He 
went on to become the first Black 
chairman of the Helsinki Commission, 
a respected voice on the world stage. 
There was not a barrier he was afraid 
to break. He was steadfast in providing 
a voice to all those who needed an ally, 
including minorities, children, immi-
grants, and people struggling in pov-
erty. 
Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if 
I didn’t acknowledge that he could do 
more with the simple turn of a phrase 
than many of us could do with 100 
words or more. As he was yielding back 
his time in the committee or here on 
the floor, especially if he felt that we 
were considering a bill that somehow 
was disadvantaging vulnerable people 
in this country, he would get up and 
give a stern and passionate and suc-
cinct lecture to this body. Then he 
would conclude by saying: That is my 
story, and I am sticking to it. And if I 
offended any of you by what I said, 
that was intentional. 
It was pure Alcee Hastings. He chose 
his words carefully, and he meant 
every one of them. Now I have lost a 
dear friend, this Congress has lost a 
giant, and those who all too often go 
unseen in America have lost a cham-
pion. 
We send our prayers and our condo-
lences to his family, to his dedicated 
and wonderful staff, and to his con-
stituents, knowing that these Halls 
will never see someone quite like him 
again. 
May he rest in peace.

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will amend 
the rule immediately to consider H.R. 
2430, the Temporary Reauthorization 
and Study of the Emergency Sched-
uling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. This 
critical bill would extend the Drug En-
forcement Administration’s authority 
to temporarily schedule fentanyl ana-
logues for another year. 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Biden’s 
open border policy is encouraging drug 
trafficking of substances like fentanyl. 
So it is imperative that the Drug En-
forcement Administration retain this 
authority to keep those dangerous sub-
stances out of our communities. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this 
is a critical reauthorization and it is 
imperative to maintaining our Nation’s 
efforts to address the opiate epidemic. 
In February of 2018, the Drug En-
forcement Administration used its au-
thority to place nonscheduled fentanyl- 
like substances temporarily into sched-
ule I for a period of 2 years. It is impor-
tant that we do not let this authoriza-
tion lapse, as it listed fentanyl is still 
an eminent threat to Americans. 
The Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion testified that the positive impacts 
since implementing this temporary 
schedule are significant, stating that 
prior to this action, the DEA observed 
a rapid and continuous emergence of a 
new fentanyl-like substance each time 
it is scheduled to remove a fentanyl- 
like substance. In other words, you 
take one out and one would pop up. 
We simply cannot return to that re-
ality because of the deadly nature of 
this substance. 
Just last month, two north Texas 
teenagers died from counterfeit pills 
containing fentanyl. Last year, the 
Dallas DEA found over 16 kilograms of 
fentanyl targeting the region. It con-
tained over 8 million lethal doses—one 
for every north Texas resident. 
Unfortunately, throughout this pan-
demic, the opiate crisis has continued, 
and it has gotten worse. Exacerbating 
this problem is the ease with which 
fentanyl is being smuggled across our 
southern border. The changes in border 
security enforcement that have oc-
curred have sent a message to the car-
tels and the drug smugglers that secur-
ing our sovereignty is no longer an ad-
ministration priority. What is worse is 
that some adults and children are 
forced to carry these drugs into the 
United States by smugglers. Some-
times 
innocent 
individuals 
traffic 
drugs into the United States in their 
vehicles without even knowing that 
the cartels have placed it there with-
out their knowledge. 
The only way to limit the exploi-
tation of innocent individuals and to 
protect our American communities is 
to limit the market for these vile prod-
ucts. 
During the past year, this country 
has suffered over half a million deaths 
to an unforeseen disease. We should do 
everything we can to trample the mar-
ket of a known killer: fentanyl. We 
must equip our communities to address 
this issue at its very source. 
The temporary emergency resched-
uling of fentanyl analogues to schedule 
I is a necessary tool for the Drug En-
forcement 
Administration 
to 
work 
with other agencies and law enforce-
ment officials to address the threat of 
illicit fentanyl. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
this bill, and I strongly urge fellow 
Members to defeat the previous ques-
tion and support H.R. 2430. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CAR-
TER) to speak on the amendment. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I am here today to ask my 
colleagues across the aisle to support 
the efforts outlined in H.R. 2430 to ex-
tend 
the 
emergency 
scheduling 
of 
fentanyl analogues. 
This is an opportunity for us to work 
together to help stem the flow of dead-
ly fentanyl and its analogues into our 
country. This is also an issue that im-
pacts every one of us and the commu-
nities that we call home. 
We all know someone who has been 
the victim of an addictive or illegal 
opioid. Just last week in my home 
State of Georgia, the Georgia attorney 
general announced that he is inves-
tigating fatal drug overdoses blamed 
on counterfeit medications—medica-
tions laced with fentanyl. Those indi-
viduals bought illegal products they 
believed to be Xanax, Percocet, and 
Roxicodone. 
These 
clusters 
of 
overdoses were spread across my State, 
and I know we are not alone. It con-
tinues to take the lives of our fellow 
Americans, and more must be done to 
fight this. 
Fentanyl is an extremely dangerous 
substance. Three milligrams is enough 
to be fatal. It is 50 times more potent 
than heroin. First responders just 
touching or accidentally inhaling the 
substance can experience severe com-
plications and possible death. 
So where is this coming from? 
Across the border with Mexico. 
The GAO even reports that seizures 
of fentanyl from Mexico increased by 
more than 200 percent from 2018 to 2020. 
Every 
year, 
U.S. 
Border 
Patrol 
agents intercept enough fentanyl to 
kill every single American several 
times over. In fact, the CBP announced 
in 2019 that they had enough seized 
fentanyl to kill 800 million people. 
I visited the border last week to see 
this crisis firsthand. I was surprised. It 
wasn’t a crisis. It was a disaster. It is 
a disaster on the border. Border Patrol 
agents are so overwhelmed with a 20- 
year record high number of illegal im-
migrants that smugglers and cartels 
are using this as an opportunity to 
traffic more fentanyl. 
If the President and Vice President 
would visit the border like I did, then 
they would be able to talk to the 
agents firsthand and see for themselves 
how serious this issue is. Instead, they 
have elected to leave our border wide 
open. 
We are inviting drug traffickers to 
bring fentanyl into the country and 
distribute 
it 
into 
our 
streets—my 
streets 
and 
your 
streets, 
Madam 
Speaker. 
Madam Speaker, if we don’t look at 
long-term scheduling options for all

last line of defense to provide a deter-
rent to illegal distribution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Our commu-
nities are at risk, Madam Speaker, 
your community and my community— 
all of our communities. They don’t 
care if it is a Democratic community 
or a Republican community. They are 
at risk. 
It is time for us to work together as 
a Congress to pass good legislation. We 
started to address the opioid epidemic 
in a bipartisan fashion when Repub-
licans were in the majority with the 
passage of the SUPPORT Act—a bipar-
tisan product—and the Comprehensive 
Addiction and Recovery Act. We should 
get back to working together, and this 
is a great opportunity to do so. 
Madam Speaker, as you know, profes-
sionally I am a pharmacist. I have wit-
nessed this. It does not discriminate. 
Opioid addiction doesn’t care if you are 
a Republican, a Democrat, a male, a fe-
male, African American, Caucasian, or 
Hispanic. It does not care. It is an ad-
diction that is paralyzing our country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the 
previous question so that we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 2430. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, just to follow Chair-
man MCGOVERN, I thank him for his 
very kind words on my friend and 
neighbor, Alcee Hastings, who was a 
brilliant and forceful advocate for jus-
tice and the great senior leader of the 
Florida delegation. We miss him dear-
ly. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
a letter from the National 
Urban League in support of the Pay-
check Fairness Act. 
NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE, 
April 14, 2021. 
Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) 
and vote no on harmful amendments. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
National Urban League, with 90 local affili-
ates in 36 states and the District of Colum-
bia, I strongly urge you to pass the Paycheck 
Fairness Act, H.R. 7, without amendments 
that limit its scope or undermine its critical 
protections. 
The National Urban League is a civil 
rights organization dedicated to the eco-
nomic empowerment of African Americans 
and other underserved populations. The Na-
tional Urban League and our affiliate move-
ment have a strong interest in ensuring eq-
uity in the workplace, including payment. 
Despite federal and state equal pay laws, 
gender pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to 
these gaps are exacerbating the financial ef-
fects of COVID–19, falling particularly heav-
ily on women of color and the families who 
depend on their income. The Paycheck Fair-
ness Act, which has been passed three pre-
vious times by the House of Representatives, 
mostly recently in the 116th Congress, offers 
a much-needed update to the Equal Pay Act 
of 1963 by providing new tools to battle per-
vasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimina-
tion. 
Women are increasingly the primary or co- 
breadwinner in their families and cannot af-
ford to be shortchanged any longer. Women 
working full-time, year-round are typically 
paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to 
men, adding up to a loss of more than 
$400,000 over a lifetime. This wage gap varies 
by race and is often larger for women of 
color: Black women working full time, year- 
round typically make only 63 cents, Native 
American women only 60 cents, and Latinas 
only 55 cents, for every dollar paid to their 
white, non-Hispanic male counterparts. Over 
the course of a 40-year career, Black women 
lose nearly $1 million in earnings and 
Latinas lose more than $1 million. While 
Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) 
women make 85 cents for every dollar paid to 
white, non-Hispanic men, many AAPI com-
munities experience drastically wider pay 
gaps. Moms are paid less than dads. And even 
when controlling for factors like education 
and experience, pay gaps persist and start 
early in women’s careers and contribute to a 
wealth gap that follows them throughout 
their lifetimes. Persistent pay discrimina-
tion, often cloaked by employer-imposed pay 
secrecy policies, is one factor driving these 
wage gaps. 
These pay gaps can be addressed only if 
workers have the legal tools necessary to 
challenge discrimination and employers are 
provided with effective incentives and tech-
nical assistance to comply with the law. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and 
strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to en-
sure that it provides robust protection 
against sex-based pay discrimination. Among 
other provisions, this comprehensive bill: 
ends secrecy around pay by barring retalia-
tion against workers who voluntarily discuss 
or disclose their wages, and requiring em-
ployers to report pay data to the EEOC; 
prohibits employers from relying on salary 
history in determining future pay, so that 
pay discrimination does not follow women 
from job to job; 
closes loopholes that have allowed employ-
ers to pay women less than men for the same 
work without any important business jus-
tification related to the job; 
ensures women can receive the same ro-
bust remedies for sex-based pay discrimina-
tion that are currently available to those 
subjected to discrimination based on race 
and ethnicity; and provides much needed 
training and technical assistance, as well as 
data collection and research. 
The COVID–19 pandemic and systemic rac-
ism have exposed how the work performed 
primarily by women, and particularly Black 
and brown women, has long been and con-
tinues to be undervalued and underpaid, even 
as the rest of the country is newly recog-
nizing the essential nature of this work. We 
cannot build back an economy that works 
for everyone without ensuring that all 
women can work with equality, safety, and 
dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing 
the Paycheck Fairness Act would mark a vi-
tally important step toward ensuring this 
becomes reality. 
We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness 
Act 
without 
harmful 
amendments 
that 
weaken its critical protections. If you have 
any questions, please do not hesitate to con-
tact Joi Chaney at the National Urban 
League. 
Thank you for your consideration, 
MARC H. MORIAL, 
President & CEO. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support the 
passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
I have some important questions and 
simple answers. 
First, do rent and food cost less for 
women than men? 
The answer is no. 
Do women work less hard than men? 
Absolutely not. 
Do children depend on the financial 
support of their mothers? 
That answer is yes. 
So should women make less money 
than men for doing equal work? 
Obviously not. 
Yet, for many reasons, women are 
paid an average of just 82 cents for 
every dollar paid to men—it is even 
lower for women of color—causing 
struggling 
families 
and 
eventually 
lower Social Security benefits and re-
tirement savings for our grandmothers. 
No wonder it is women and their chil-
dren who are the majority of poor in 
this country. 
As we emerge from a pandemic that 
has hit women workers the hardest, 
isn’t it time for an economy that com-
pensates women fairly for their work? 
Of course it is. 
This requires numerous actions, in-
cluding making sure that women and 
girls have full access to healthcare, 
education, 
and 
financial 
resources; 
family-friendly workplaces; combating 
on-the-job sexual harassment and vio-
lence; making child and adult care 
more affordable; and raising the pay 
for minimum wage workers, two-thirds 
of whom are women. 
Today, we can take a giant step to-
ward this moral and legal imperative 
of closing the gender wage gap by pass-
ing the Paycheck Fairness Act and giv-
ing workers the tools to enforce the 
Equal Pay Act of 1963, that requires 
pay equity. 
Isn’t it time, Madam Speaker, that 
our mothers, daughters, and sisters get 
paid fairly for their hard day’s work? 
Of course. 
That is my final question and final 
answer for today. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. MEIJER) to speak on the 
amendment. 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 2430 to extend the 
DEA’s temporary authority to schedule 
fentanyl-related substances for 1 year. 
Fentanyl is a deadly opioid that kills 
thousands 
of 
Americans 
annually. 
When the chemical formula of fentanyl 
is even slightly modified, creating a 
fentanyl analogue, these substances 
can become exponentially more lethal. 
These analogues have been a driving 
force behind the opioid epidemic that 
continues to plague our local commu-
nities. 
The authority for the DEA to classify 
these analogues as schedule I sub-
stances is critical to law enforcement’s 
ability to keep these drugs off our 
streets. 
As a member of the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, I recently joined my 
colleagues on a trip to assess the ongo-
ing crisis on our southern border.

H1780 
April 14, 2021 
Fentanyl has continued to move into 
our country through our ports of entry, 
mainly through our border with Mex-
ico. On the trip, we spoke with law en-
forcement officials who detailed the 
challenges 
posed 
by 
transnational 
criminal organizations, including drug 
traffickers, who are attempting to take 
advantage of the current crisis. 
With already limited border security 
resources being diverted to deal with 
the humanitarian crisis, drug smug-
glers are continuing their attempts to 
push dangerous substances, including 
fentanyl, into the United States. In the 
first quarter of 2021, the seizure of 
fentanyl at our southwestern border by 
CBP has increased by a staggering 233 
percent from the first quarter of 2020. 
At a time when our country is experi-
encing a border crisis and an opioid cri-
sis, we need to be enacting policies 
that strengthen law enforcement and 
enhance public safety instead of em-
powering bad actors who are con-
tinuing to put our communities at 
risk. 
If we fail to act on this commonsense 
extension before the upcoming May 6 
deadline, we will be taking away a 
major tool that law enforcement needs 
to keep our communities safe. 
With fentanyl analogues no longer 
properly scheduled, drug smugglers 
will continue and remain emboldened 
and even expand their attempts to 
move fentanyl into the United States. 
This would exacerbate two already 
unsustainable crises: the ongoing surge 
at our southern border and the opioid 
epidemic that has devastated lives of 
Americans across the country. 
Madam Speaker, for that reason, I 
urge defeat of the previous question. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers, so I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1600 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
And just to speak a little further on 
the amendment that has been offered if 
the previous question is defeated, H.R. 
2430; like so many Members, I too have 
traveled down to the border. The dif-
ference is I have done that many times 
over the last 12 years. 
It has never been this bad; and I need 
to emphasize that. I encourage the 
President and the Vice President to 
visit the southern border, come to the 
Lower Rio Grande Valley and see for 
themselves, firsthand, just how bad 
this crisis is. 
And then back to the business at 
hand. I want to be very clear about the 
two bills included in today’s rule. Wage 
discrimination has no place in any so-
ciety, and it is currently illegal in the 
United States of America. 
The path Congress must take is to 
not increase opportunities for trial 
lawyers, but to continue its focus on 
strong economic policy that actually 
expands opportunities for all Ameri-
cans. 
Prior to the pandemic, nearly 75 mil-
lion women participated in the work-
force, more than at any other time in 
history. A robust and resilient econ-
omy will provide the jobs, provide the 
wages and the wage gains that Ameri-
cans expect and deserve. 
Also, workplace violence is a threat 
that no American should have to face. 
The threat is particularly high for 
healthcare workers and social service 
workers. These workers dedicate their 
lives to taking care of others, and they 
deserve to be taken care of in return. 
While I support the goal of H.R. 1195, 
I believe it would benefit from further 
discussion to ensure that the timeline 
for issuing a rule and developing work-
place violence prevention will produce 
the most effective and safe outcome for 
American workers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the 
underlying measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I include in the RECORD a March 
25 New York Times article entitled ‘‘ In 
25 Years, the Pay Gap Has Shrunk by 
Just 8 Cents.’’

Megan Rapinoe is a two-time World Cup 
champion who has played to sold-out sta-
diums around the globe; what she has in 
common with nearly every American woman 
is that she’s underpaid. 
On Wednesday, Ms. Rapinoe testified dur-
ing a hearing held by Representative Carolyn 
B. Maloney to examine economic harm 
caused by gender inequalities, particularly 
for women of color. 
Today is All Women’s Equal Pay Day, Ms. 
Maloney said. But it’s not Equal Pay Day for 
all women. 
Black women would have to work until 
Aug. 3, 2021, to earn what men made in 2020. 
For Latina women, the date doesn’t come 
until Oct. 21. 
‘‘This is a disgrace,’’ Ms. Maloney said. 
‘‘And it has long-term consequences for 
women and families.’’ 
Wage discrimination isn’t limited to any 
one sector or income level. 
Take Ms. Rapinoe, whose fight for equal 
pay has become something of a calling card 
for the U.S. women’s team, and who played a 
central role in the team’s lawsuit on unequal 
pay filed in 2019. 
‘‘One cannot simply outperform inequal-
ity,’’ she said. ‘‘Or be excellent enough to es-
cape discrimination.’’ 
If it can happen to me, she said, ‘‘it can— 
and 
it 
does—happen 
to 
every 
person 
marginalized by gender.’’ 
In Her Words looked at the history of 
Equal Pay Day, the reasons for the wage gap 
and what can be done to close it. 
It’s a symbolic day that illustrates how far 
into the current year American women 
would need to work to earn what their male 
counterparts earned last year. Put another 
way, because there is a disparity in what 
women and men are paid, women would need 
to work around 448 days to earn what men 
earn in just 365 days. 
Race plays a part, too: For Black and His-
panic women, the numbers are worse. For 
Asian women, the numbers skew a bit better. 
Estimates vary on how much the wage gap 
will cost an American woman over the 
course of her career. The National Women’s 
Law Center puts it at $406,280 in lost income 
on average, but that number can top $1 mil-
lion for Hispanic women and is just shy of $1 
million for Black and Native American 
women. 
How did it become a thing? 
Equal Pay Day was established in 1996 by 
the National Committee on Pay Equity. 
Today marks the 25th. But debates around 
pay equity date back much further than 
that. 
Carolyn York, secretary-treasurer of the 
National Committee on Pay Equity, pointed 
out in an email that in 1942, as huge numbers 
of women began replacing men in the work 
force, the National War Labor Board urged 
employers to make ‘‘adjustments which 
equalize wage or salary rates paid to females 
with the rates paid to males for comparable 
quality and quantity of work on the same or 
similar operations.’’ But two decades on, in 
the 1960s, women were still earning only 
around 59 cents for every dollar a man made. 
Do other countries have a gender wage 
gap? 
Of course they do. According to this 
O.E.C.D. study, the United States falls be-
hind Canada and ahead of Mexico. In addi-
tion to Canada, other countries that have a 
smaller pay gap than the United States are 
Romania, Colombia, Belgium, Costa Rica, 
Denmark, Norway . . . the list goes on. And 
on. 
Has the pay gap narrowed over time? 
Yes, but not by much. We’re talking pen-
nies. This year, it’s estimated that American 
women will earn around 82 cents for every 
dollar that a man earns. A decade ago in 
2011, it was 77 cents. In 1996, the first ‘‘offi-
cial’’ Equal Pay Day, it was around 74 cents. 
And this top-line number doesn’t account for 
differences in earnings among different ra-
cial groups. 
How is the wage gap number calculated? 
The pay gap refers to the ratio of female to 
male median annual earnings for full-time 
workers. Think of it as a fraction: The nu-
merator is the difference between male and 
female median earnings, and the denomi-
nator is male median earnings. The actual 
number might look different depending on 
the source it’s coming from, because some 
sources factor in characteristics like age, 
family size, education level and industry. 
‘‘We treat this issue as if you could sum-
marize it in one number,’’ said Claudia 
Goldin, an economics professor at Harvard 
University. ‘‘It’s the headline,’’ not really 
the full picture. 
Are there jobs where women are better 
paid than men? 
Not according to C. Nicole Mason, presi-
dent of the Institute for Women’s Policy Re-
search. When men enter female-dominated 
sectors like nursing or education, the job be-
gins paying more, she explained. But the in-
verse is not true: ‘‘When women enter male- 
dominated spaces, they don’t get paid more 
than men.’’ 
How long will it take to close the pay gap 
if we do nothing about it? 
Mark your calendars for 2059; if current 
trends continue, the gender wage gap is ex-
pected to close in a mere 38 years. For Black 
and Hispanic women, the deadline is a whole 
century away. If we do nothing, ‘‘my daugh-
ter, and daughter’s daughter, will not see 
pay equity in their lives,’’ Dr. Mason said. 
So what exactly explains the gap? 
There are many factors at play, according 
to the American Association of University 
Women. One of them is that the fields in 
which women dominate tend to pay less than 
fields dominated by men. This is irrespective 
of education or skill required. 
The 
‘‘motherhood 
penalty’’ 
also 
com-
plicates the wage gap. Moms are less likely

to be hired, they receive lower salaries when 
they are, and are less likely to be tapped on 
the shoulder for promotion. (Ironic given re-
search suggests moms are some of the most 
productive employees.) 
And women work around two-thirds of the 
low-paying jobs in the United States; jobs 
that not only put workers at an economic 
disadvantage, but also tend to be more un-
stable. 
There is also ‘‘invisible labor’’—things like 
caregiving responsibilities and household 
chores—that women do in addition to their 
full-time work. ‘‘Women perform up to 30 
percent more unpaid labor,’’ Dr. Mason said. 
Not to put too fine a point upon it, but ‘‘un-
paid labor is unpaid.’’ And it’s very hard—if 
not impossible—to do both your job and take 
care of the household at the same time. 
There’s also good old-fashioned sexism at 
play: Even when men and women are per-
forming the exact same jobs, women tend to 
receive less compensation thanks to overt or 
unconscious biases, as well as stereotypes 
that make it more difficult for women to ne-
gotiate. 
The pay gap is caused by a ‘‘layering ef-
fect’’ of all of these things, said Kimberly 
Churches, the CEO of the American Associa-
tion of University Women. Ultimately, ‘‘this 
really is how we value women and how we 
value women of color in our society,’’ she 
said. 
Did Covid make it worse? 
In a year of devastating job loss, especially 
for women—hence the talk of a ‘‘she-ces-
sion’’—the Institute for Women’s Policy Re-
search released a piece of research that 
seemed, on its face, like good news. In 2020, 
it found the weekly gender wage gap for full- 
time workers shrunk to 17.7 percent from 
18.5 percent. Seems positive, right? Not so 
fast. 
As Ms. Goldin of Harvard explained, if the 
female labor force is reduced, but most of 
those reductions are from the bottom part of 
distribution (restaurant servers and retail 
workers, for instance), then women’s wages 
relative to men’s will rise. 
This manifests as an overall rise in wom-
en’s wages. And that’s what happened here. 
But underneath the top-line number, Dr. 
Mason pointed out, many, many lower-paid 
female workers are struggling. 
What should companies do about it? 
Closing the wage gap demands an invest-
ment of time and resources. 
First, companies can audit workers’ pay 
and collect data to determine the levels of 
disparity between their male and female 
workers, said Serena Fong, a vice president 
at Catalyst. Salesforce, for example, com-
mitted to reviewing all its workers’ salaries 
in 2015, and over the following years spent 
more than $9 million on adjustments to give 
women equal pay. 
Salary bands, which give the range of pay 
for a given role, can also help level the play-
ing field between male and female workers in 
salary negotiations. (Though broadly speak-
ing, a wide salary band can provide ‘‘too 
much range to pay people unequally,’’ Dr. 
Mason said.) 
And governments? 
The Equal Pay Act, passed nearly 60 years 
ago, made it illegal to discriminate by sex in 
setting wages. But in practice, it can be hard 
for women to know whether they’re actually 
being paid equally. It’s not common to ask 
your colleagues what they make while 
you’re chatting by the water cooler. 
In the last decade, more than a dozen 
states and the District of Columbia have 
adopted legislation prohibiting pay secrecy 
in the workplace. Still, a 2017–18 survey 
found that nearly half of fulltime workers 
were discouraged or prohibited from talking 
about their pay, meaning more legislation 
and enforcement is needed. 
Ms. Churches also supports passing the 
Paycheck Fairness Act at a federal level, ‘‘so 
we can ban the use of salary history ques-
tions in the hiring process.’’ Such questions 
‘‘just compound women’s lack of earnings 
going forward as they negotiate their sala-
ries.’’ 
And individuals? 
Ask your colleagues how much they make, 
as awkward as that may sound. 
Negotiation is also key. Research shows 
that women who consistently negotiate their 
salaries make more than $1 million more 
over the course of their lifetimes, compared 
with those who don’t. But of course, Covid 
hasn’t helped: A new survey from Ann Eliza-
beth Konkel of Indeed suggests women feel 
even more uncomfortable asking for a raise 
or promotion than they did prepandemic. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, on 
the anniversary of Women’s Equal Pay 
Day, U.S. women’s soccer player Megan 
Rapinoe, in a congressional hearing 
said: ‘‘One cannot simply outperform 
inequality.’’ 
Wage discrimination isn’t limited to 
any one sector or income level, and 
Congress must act to stop it. 
Mr. Speaker, the importance of this 
issue is really about the proper en-
forcement of a bill that was first en-
acted in 1963. We generally agree on the 
importance of that legislation. 
Where we disagree is enforcement. 
And we have had years to see what the 
proper disincentives are and incentives 
for proper behavior when it comes to 
protecting women in the workforce, 
and on the second bill—predominantly 
women—but people who work in vul-
nerable positions where they are sub-
ject to greater violence. 
On pay equity, we look at States like 
California where I am from, and we can 
see that our laws, our aggressive laws 
have worked, at least to help with the 
pay equity situation. Who can deny, in 
our lifetimes, the benefit to the U.S. 
economy, to all of us, for having 
women in the workforce? We should be 
able to compensate that benefit that 
we have all gotten. 
As a survivor of cancer, I have been 
taken by how many young women went 
into the medical profession, and they 
helped to develop the medicine that 
has saved my life, a disease that, 15 
years ago, at stage IV, when I was diag-
nosed, there was little that could be 
done to extend people’s lives. That re-
search came from brilliant people, 
many of them women. Why would I 
want to inhibit or disincentivize any 
young person, any woman, any young 
woman from going into that field? 
I know that my friend from Texas 
knows this, we want the best and the 
brightest to help with our medical 
challenges, irrespective of what their 
background is or what their sex is. 
Mr. Speaker, every day we wait to 
pass these bills, healthcare workers are 
being harmed and families are going 
deeper and deeper into poverty. Our in-
equality issues get worse, not better. 
We should not waste another moment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 303 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
2430) to amend the Temporary Reauthoriza-
tion and Study of the Emergency Scheduling 
of Fentanyl Analogues Act to extend for one 
year the temporary order for fentanyl-re-
lated substances. All points of order against 
consideration of the bill are waived. The bill 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Energy & Commerce; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 2430. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BLUMENAUER). The question is on or-
dering the previous question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

HONORING THE LIFE OF ALCEE 
HASTINGS 
(Mr. DIAZ-BALART asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
it is my solemn duty to rise today on 
behalf of the Florida delegation as we 
continue to grieve the passing of our 
colleague and our friend, Alcee Has-
tings of Florida. 
Congressman 
Alcee 
Hastings 
was 
more than a colleague; he was a dear 
friend to me and to my family. Madam 
Speaker, 
my 
brother, 
Congressman 
Lincoln Diaz-Balart, served with Alcee 
Hastings on the Rules Committee; and, 
through him, I also developed a very 
special relationship. 
Along with Congresswomen Carrie 
Meek and Corrine Brown, Alcee Has-
tings was the first African American 
from Florida to serve in Congress after 
more than 100 years. 
Alcee Hastings dedicated his life to 
serving others and to fighting for 
human rights. You know, Alcee lived 
by Dr. Martin Luther King’s phrase, 
‘‘An injustice anywhere is an affront to 
justice everywhere.’’ 
Alcee Hastings’ brilliance, his perse-
verance, and his charisma, along with 
his ceaseless fight for human rights, 
built a lasting and meaningful legacy. 
And even during that last battle of his, 
the one that ultimately took his life, 
he continued to serve with passion, 
with great heart, and always with that 
special spark that he had, that smile of 
his that he always had. 
We are truly heartbroken by his pass-
ing, and we offer our deepest condo-
lences and prayers to his family and all 
of those who knew and loved him. 
Florida and Congress really lost a 
trailblazer. 
Madam Speaker, I would also like to 
thank one very special person, Lale 
Morrison, Alcee’s longtime chief of 
staff, for her service to the people of 
Florida and equally as important, her 
dedication and her friendship to Alcee 
Hastings. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR). 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend from 
Florida for yielding. 
It is with great sadness that I rise on 
behalf of the Florida delegation, and 
you can see we have many new Florid-
ians in our delegation today because 
we had such great love, respect, and ad-
miration for our colleague Congress-
man Hastings. 
Congressman Hastings was a tow-
ering figure who always stood up for 
the little guy. He fought for civil 
rights. He fought for voting rights. He 
fought for affordable healthcare. He 
was tireless. 
Now, Alcee did not suffer fools or ma-
larky, and he was unafraid to point it 
out. And he did so with relish. And let 
that be a great example to all of us 
who have this tremendous responsi-
bility to stand up every day for the 
people who send us here, especially the 
voiceless and the vulnerable. 
But Alcee served with great intellect, 
with passion, with flare. He loved the 
House of Representatives. He loved the 
State of Florida. He wanted it to be 
better, and he worked on that every 
single day. But I think we are all bet-
ter for his service and his example. 
Madam Speaker, I think Alcee would 
have appreciated the fact that you are 
in bright orange today, the color of his 
beloved Florida A&M University. Go 
Rattlers. 
On behalf of the great State of Flor-
ida, we also send our love, prayers, and 
condolences to Lale, his chief of staff, 
his entire team, his family, his devoted 
friends, and I would respectfully ask 
that we recognize his life with a mo-
ment of silence, but ask and invite you

PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 117th CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION
∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.
.
S1907 
Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 14, 2021 
No. 64 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
God, our God, we honor Your Name. 
You have been our help in ages past; 
you are our hope for the years to come. 
Continue to guide our Senators with 
Your love. Answer them when they cry 
to You for assistance. Be for them a 
shade by day and a defense by night. 
May they exercise sound judgment as 
they listen closely to the whisper of 
Your wisdom that will keep them on 
the path that leads to life. May they 
trust in Your unfailing love to make 
the crooked places straight. Lord, give 
them the wisdom to permit godliness 
to fill their lives with light and joy. 
We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIAN 
AMERICANS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we 
live in partisan times, but there are 
moments when we can break through 
the typical divisions and work together 
on matters of real urgency. The anti- 
Asian hate crimes legislation this week 
is such a matter. It is a very straight-
forward and relatively modest bill to 
address a pressing and important issue 
in the country. It would designate a 
point person at the Justice Department 
to identify hate crimes towards Asian 
Americans related to COVID–19—tell-
ing Federal law enforcement to make 
these hate crimes a top priority during 
the pandemic. 
Just as important, it would send a 
strong message to two groups: to the 
Asian-American community that the 
country is paying attention to them 
and to all of America that this kind of 
bigotry cannot be tolerated. 
I was gratified to hear the Repub-
lican leader yesterday say that the 
Senate Republican conference wanted 
to move forward on the bill. 
This bill was never intended to be 
some kind of ‘‘gotcha’’ legislation. It is 
led 
by 
Senators 
HIRONO
and 
DUCKWORTH, two outstanding Asian- 
American 
Senators 
who 
rightfully 
want to respond to the rising tide of 
anti-Asian violence over the past year. 
When they asked me to move the bill 
quickly, I thought that was exactly the 
right thing to do, and here it is on the 
floor. 
The fact that Leader MCCONNELL said 
yesterday he believes discrimination 
against Asian Americans is a real prob-
lem and wants to move forward and be 
constructive is a very good thing, and 
I salute him for it. The entire Senate 
ought to stand up against the recent 
surge of anti-Asian violence. We can 
take the first step later today by vot-
ing to proceed to the legislation. 
As I said yesterday, my intention is 
to have a bipartisan amendment proc-
ess, beginning with the amendment of-
fered 
by 
Senators 
MORAN
and 
BLUMENTHAL—one a Republican and 
one a Democrat. In consultation with 
the Republican leader, we can work out 
an agreement on other germane, non- 
″gotcha’’ amendments to the bill if 
Senators have them. We should be able 
and should really try in earnest to 
reach a final resolution and pass the 
bill through the Senate very, very 
soon. 
f 
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, tak-
ing a step back for a moment, this is 
how the process should work in a close-
ly divided Senate. If the Republican 
minority allows the Senate to move 
forward with a bill where we have 
shared priorities, the Democratic ma-
jority will work to set up a process for 
the Senate to consider germane amend-
ments from both sides. 
That is the essence of the organizing 
resolution we all agreed to earlier this 
year, and hopefully it is a process we 
can repeat. In fact, we will test that 
proposition on the very next piece of 
legislation. If we are able to finish the 
anti-Asian hate crimes bill in a timely 
manner, I will move next to consider a 
bipartisan water infrastructure bill. 
The bill, the Drinking Water Infra-
structure Act, was advanced by the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee on a unanimous—unanimous— 
vote. It will authorize tens of billions 
of dollars to make sure American fami-
lies, especially low-income families, 
have access to safe and clean drinking 
water. I salute Senator CARPER, the 
chair of the committee, as well as Sen-
ator CAPITO, the ranking Republican on 
the committee, for coming together on 
such an important and necessary bill. 
So, in addition to further nomina-
tions, it is my intention to move the 
bipartisan water infrastructure bill 
next week. 
As the country turns the corner from 
COVID–19, our focus will soon shift to

how we can cement our economic re-
covery and create the jobs of the fu-
ture. President Biden’s Build Back Bet-
ter agenda—a big, bold investment in 
infrastructure and jobs—is extremely 
important to that effort. It has wide 
support among Democrats and wide 
support among the American people. 
Many, many Republicans out there in 
the country support this bill and this 
concept. The water infrastructure bill 
is a small but important part of that 
overall effort. 
We hope our Republican colleagues 
join us in advancing these proposals to 
repair and reimagine our Nation’s in-
frastructure for a new century. Just 
like the anti-Asian hate crimes bill, if 
Republicans let us get on the bill, we 
can work out a process to have bipar-
tisan debate and amendments, but if 
the Republican minority prevents the 
Senate from even debating some of 
these commonsense proposals, we will 
have to try to move forward without 
them. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday President Biden announced that 
American forces will come home from 
Afghanistan by September 11, 2021. It 
has been 20 years since that fateful day 
when the Towers fell and the Pentagon 
was hit. We in New York live particu-
larly hard with that. I still think of the 
people I knew who perished: a guy I 
played basketball with in high school; 
a businessman who helped me on the 
way up; a brave firefighter who used to 
go around the city urging people to do-
nate blood together. But in that time 
since then, America’s Armed Forces, 
thank God, have become extremely 
successful in deterring and rooting out 
terrorist networks around the globe. 
President Obama authorized the mis-
sion that took out Osama bin Laden, 
the architect of the 9/11 attacks. Our 
intelligence 
agencies 
have 
assessed 
that 
al-Qaida 
and 
other 
terrorist 
groups do not pose an immediate 
threat to strike the United States from 
Afghanistan because of the brave work 
of our Armed Forces and intelligence 
organizations. So after sinking two 
decades of blood and treasure into wars 
in the Middle East, it is time to bring 
our troops home. America does not 
need to fight forever wars. 
I applaud President Biden’s decision. 
Unlike President Trump, President 
Biden and Secretary Austin have devel-
oped a careful and thought-out plan. 
This isn’t President Trump waking up 
one morning and announcing a random 
new policy on Twitter while our gen-
erals scramble to catch up. This will be 
a careful and thought-out plan with a 
real timetable and a firm end date. 
Whenever we talk about American 
troops in the Middle East, one of the 
concerns is missions creep and the 
enormous pressure to kick the can 
down the road and delay final deci-
sions. We should and must stick to the 
date the President has proposed as the 
last day our troops will be there. I have 
been assured by the White House that 
the September 11 date will stick and 
that President Biden will not kick the 
can down the road. 
I know many Senators have ques-
tions, so I am happy to let my col-
leagues know that the administration 
has agreed to brief all Senators on this 
important decision. The briefing will 
take place soon. It will be in the SCIF, 
and everyone’s questions can be asked 
and answered. The President himself 
will address the Nation later today and 
explain the reasons for his decision. 
In my view, President Biden’s plan to 
bring American troops home from Af-
ghanistan is a very wise one. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
‘‘Biden takes the easy way out of Af-
ghanistan. The likely result is dis-
aster.’’ This is the morning’s lead edi-
torial from one of the Nation’s most 
liberal newspapers. 
The administration has decided to 
abandon U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, 
which have helped keep radical Islamic 
terrorism in check, and bizarrely, they 
decided to do so by September 11. Ap-
parently, we are to help our adver-
saries ring in the anniversary of the 
9/11 attacks by giftwrapping the coun-
try and handing it right back to them. 
Here is what this administration’s 
own national intelligence threat as-
sessment says will happen: 
The Taliban is likely to make gains on the 
battlefield, and the Afghan government will 
struggle to hold the Taliban at bay if the co-
alition withdraws support. 
This is a quote from this administra-
tion. 
In 2019, the Democratic leader and 
the now chairman of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee expressed outrage 
that the previous administration con-
sidered hosting Taliban officials for 
discussions around the date of Sep-
tember 11. 
But now a Democratic administra-
tion is going to skip the negotiations 
and just surrender an entire country 
back to the Taliban on the very same 
date? Our President should remember 
what happened when the Obama admin-
istration let political considerations 
rush a retreat from Iraq—total chaos 
and bloodshed and ISIS. 
Two years ago, I wrote a bipartisan 
amendment that warned a Republican 
administration 
against 
recklessly 
withdrawing 
from 
Afghanistan 
or 
Syria. A supermajority of Senators 
right here voted for it. A supermajority 
of Senators voted for it, warning that 
the terrorist threat had not abated. 
Where 
are 
the 
Democratic 
voices 
today? I hope we will hear from some 
of them. 
Unfortunately, this mistake in Af-
ghanistan is one of several instances of 
this new administration’s surrendering 
leverage without making America, our 
allies, or our interests more secure. 
In January, President Biden extended 
the New START agreement with Rus-
sia by Executive order for 5 years—no 
strings attached, no concessions se-
cured, not even a shorter term exten-
sion to keep up pressure on Russia to 
cooperate on a better agreement. Just 
a gift—a gift. 
And then there is Iran. Senior admin-
istration officials have gone from deni-
grating the former administration’s 
‘‘maximum pressure’’ strategy to sim-
ply begging for direct talks with Iran, 
to proactively offering to remove sanc-
tions that are ‘‘inconsistent with the 
JCPOA.’’ So which sanctions exactly 
are inconsistent with the JCPOA? Our 
sanctions on Iran’s terrorist organiza-
tions or its ballistic missile program? 
Most Republicans would be thrilled if 
President Biden could actually secure a 
better deal that holds Iran account-
able. Giving up the leverage of sanc-
tions before we even get to the table— 
before we even get to the table—or just 
return to a bad deal is certainly not a 
good sign. 
It would be hard to support any deal 
that isn’t part of a broader strategy 
that also confronts the nonnuclear 
threats Iran poses to America and to 
the region. 
On China, the administration’s tough 
talk has been welcome, but its proposal 
to cut defense spending after inflation 
suggests there is less interest in walk-
ing the walk. We will not keep pace 
with China and Russia by cutting de-
fense spending to placate fringe parts 
of the far left. 
The American people need and they 
deserve a foreign policy that puts our 
security, our partners, and our inter-
ests ahead of the reflexive desire to 
break with the last 4 years at any 
cost—at any cost. 
If this administration wants a suc-
cessful legacy on the world stage, if 
they want accomplishments that will 
endure, they need to put American 
strength back at the center and come 
back to a bipartisan mainstream. 
f 
THE FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a completely different matter, 
we know Democrats are desperate to 
create a national controversy over vot-
ing regulations, but the facts and the 
truth keep getting in the way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1909 
April 14, 2021 
American institution that occasionally 
frustrates liberal activists an evil relic 
of Jim Crow. Let me say that again. 
For more than a year, we have seen a 
coordinated 
campaign 
to 
call 
any 
American institution that occasionally 
frustrates liberal activists an evil relic 
of Jim Crow. 
When these talking points came into 
circulation last summer, their focus 
was the legislative filibuster here in 
the Senate, except it was Senate Demo-
crats who had just used the legislative 
filibuster to kill Senator TIM SCOTT’s 
police reform, body camera, and anti- 
lynching legislation. 
Two days ago, our colleague the as-
sistant Democratic leader suggested he 
now opposes the filibuster because it 
was used back in the 1920s to block an 
anti-lynching bill. To be clear, our col-
league from Illinois was a loud and 
proud defender of the current Senate 
rules as recently at 2018. This isn’t 
about the 1920s. It is not about the 
1920s. It is about Democrats wanting 
different sets of rules, depending on 
whether or not they happen to be in 
the majority. 
Our colleague didn’t need to go back 
nine decades to find instances of Demo-
crats’ filibustering a Republican anti- 
lynching bill. He only needed to go 
back 9 months. He didn’t have to go 
back to the 1920s but just go back 9 
months to find an example of Demo-
crats filibustering an anti-lynching 
bill. 
Last summer, 44 Senate Democrats 
locked 
arms 
and 
filibustered 
TIM 
SCOTT’s police reform, body camera, 
and anti-lynching legislation because 
it was not far left enough or anti-police 
enough. That is the irony here. If any 
recent Senate filibusters have been 
reminiscent of the 1920s, it was when 
Democrats killed a Republican anti- 
lynching bill just last summer. 
Here is the truth. Our colleagues 
can’t defend any of the details of their 
radical policies. So they want to 
change the subject—change the sub-
ject—by any means necessary. 
Look at voting regulations. The re-
cent bill passed in the State of Georgia 
mandates more days of early voting 
than plenty of Democratic-run States 
allow. It continues no-excuse absentee 
voting, which some blue States do not 
allow. There is no factual standard by 
which its overall approach is radically 
more restrictive than the rules in place 
in many other States, blue or red. 
The Washington Post has given the 
White House its worst rating, four— 
four 
Pinocchios—for 
repeated 
lies 
about Georgia and the election law. 
But the President and his staff just 
keep on doubling down. 
One of our colleagues who represents 
Georgia put his name to a public state-
ment—to a public statement—with in-
accurate information about the bill. 
In the Rules Committee, the Demo-
cratic leader shouted angry attacks at 
things the Georgia law simply doesn’t 
do. 
Why the fake narratives? Why the 
falsehoods? We all know why. For more 
than 2 years, Washington Democrats 
have been desperate to pass a sweeping 
partisan takeover of our democracy. It 
is 
packed—packed—with 
shameless 
provisions that have nothing to do 
with ballot access. 
They want to take the bipartisan 
Federal Election Commission, make it 
a partisan body, and give Democrats 
the majority. They want to send tax-
payers’ money to political campaigns. 
They want to expand Washington’s po-
licing of Americans’ speech. They want 
to neuter voter ID and mandate ballot 
harvesting in all 50 States. Strangely 
enough, for multiple years now, this 
exact same power grab has been their 
answer 
to 
every 
changing 
cir-
cumstance. When they didn’t like the 
outcome of the 2016 election, Demo-
crats said our democracy was broken 
and only this takeover could fix it. 
Then, in 2020, they got the result they 
liked. Suddenly, this same bill became 
the way to simply preserve a system 
that functioned well. 
There seems to be no situation where 
this attempted power grab is not the 
Democrats’ answer. I think we can 
learn tomorrow that an asteroid was 
hurtling toward Earth, and Democrats 
would say our only hope was to pass 
H.R. 1. 
This isn’t about responding to recent 
State laws. It is not about justice or 
equity. Washington Democrats want to 
rewrite all 50 States’ election laws. 
They want to take over the Federal 
Election Commission. And they have 
been trying out different justifications 
for multiple years straight to get what 
they want. 
Any 
Federal 
law 
addressing 
the 
ground rules of our democracy has a 
special obligation to be sober, to be 
factual, and to be bipartisan. The Sen-
ate has done just that in the past. We 
have passed reasonable laws by huge, 
bipartisan margins making it easier to 
vote but harder to cheat. 
So ask yourself: Why won’t Demo-
crats today deal in truth and facts? 
Why do they keep using the same 
smears to distract from their policies? 
Why are they hell-bent on a bill that 
passed the House with purely partisan 
support 
but 
bipartisan 
opposition? 
Talk about tipping your hand.

MAIDEN SPEECH 
Mr. 
MARSHALL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I am honored to stand on this 
hallowed Senate floor and share my 
gratitude for and the priorities of the 
people of Kansas. 
I want to start by thanking the peo-
ple of Kansas who believed in me and 
sent me here to represent them. It is 
an honor of a lifetime to follow in the 
steps of heroic Kansans who preceded 
me in this legislative body. That in-
cludes sharing this tour of duty with 
my long-time friend whom I have ad-
mired for decades and now my senior 
Senator, JERRY MORAN, as well as leg-
ends of this Chamber, my mentors Bob 
Dole and Pat Roberts. 
But before I continue, I want to say 
a special word of gratitude to my fam-
ily for all of their support. I would not 
be here today without the support of 
my wife of 37 years now, Laina, our 
four children and their spouses, our 
three grandchildren, as well as my par-
ents, brother, sister, and extended fam-
ily, who in so many ways have contrib-
uted to our campaigns and the work we 
have done in Congress. I am grateful 
for their understanding, their unwaver-
ing support, and sacrifice of privacy 
and family time, but, mostly, I am 
grateful for the values they passed on 
to me. 
I am grateful for the many teachers, 
coaches, pastors, and personal friends 
who inspired me and gave me a solid 
foundation of values that have seen us 
through tough times. These values pro-
vided the foundation for me, a fifth- 
generation farm kid, to become a first- 
generation college student and live my 
American dream as a physician in rural 
America. 
And these values have become pil-
lars, the sturdiest of which in my life 
are faith, family, community, edu-
cation, and hard work—a faith that 
you live in your heart, not wear on 
your shirt sleeves; a family that loves 
and stands beside you no matter what; 
a community where everyone looks out 
for each other; an education that is the 
great equalizer, leveling the playing 
field for all; and, finally, a belief in 
hard work that paves the way to 
achieve your American dream. 
As I traveled Kansas this past year, I 
carried these pillars with me while I 
heard from people all over the State, 
and they gave three very clear prior-
ities: No. 1, provide for their safety, 
health, and security; No. 2, to bring 
back our jobs and economy; and, No. 3, 
to protect our values and our God- 
given, inalienable rights. 
I am here in the Senate to do just 
that, to fight for the people of Kansas,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1910 
April 14, 2021 
for all Americans. But more than any-
one else, I am here to fight for our chil-
dren and grandchildren. And like an-
other great Kansan, the 34th President 
of the United States, Dwight David Ei-
senhower, the decisions I make will be 
most guided by the impact they will 
have on future generations, not by to-
night’s news or the simultaneous tweet 
that goes out as I raise my thumb up or 
down. History will be the judge of my 
decisions, not social media. 
The motto of the 1st Infantry Divi-
sion of the U.S. Army, the Big Red One, 
housed in my home State of Kansas is 
‘‘No Mission Too Difficult. No Sacrifice 
Too Great. Duty First!’’ 
It is with this fighting attitude I in-
tend to fully fund our military; secure 
our borders; as the son and brother of 
veterans, and as a veteran myself, 
honor our commitment to those who 
protected our freedoms and values; and 
as the son of a police chief, fully sup-
port our law enforcement. 
I am so grateful for all law enforce-
ment officers, including those here at 
the U.S. Capitol. They put their lives 
on the line every day, and we join the 
entire Nation in mourning those heroic 
officers who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice keeping us safe. 
While we too often hear calls to 
defund the police and weaken our mili-
tary readiness, we are still a nation of 
law and order, and we must advance 
President Reagan’s philosophy of peace 
through strength. 
Pre-COVID, we had the strongest 
economy in my lifetime, thanks to Re-
publican-led policies put into place 
over the last 4 years. Lower taxes and 
deregulation resulted in historically 
low unemployment rates, as well as 
American energy independence and af-
fordable energy costs. With agriculture 
being responsible for 40 percent of the 
Kansas economy, these policies, along 
with strong trade agreements, provided 
the tools necessary to ensure our farm-
ers, ranchers, and producers remain 
profitable and our rural communities 
prosperous. 
But here is what concerns me today. 
Like my grandma often told me at the 
family supper table, there are three 
things you can count on from the cur-
rent majority party: They will spend a 
lot of your money. They will raise your 
taxes. And they will increase regula-
tions. Just like my grandma warned, 
within the first 3 months of this new 
administration, we have seen an on-
slaught of harmful redtape, proposed 
tax increases, and an unprecedented 
spending spree. 
Fighting government redtape and 
working to ensure Kansans keep more 
of their hard-earned money as a means 
to harness job growth and help our 
economy recover will be what I work 
for each day. 
Lastly and most importantly, as this 
is what is keeping me up late at night, 
I was sent here to protect the Kansas 
values I was raised on. These values are 
still held by the majority of Ameri-
cans, and many of us are tired of being 
canceled, censured, and lectured to. 
I acknowledge we all need to be woke 
up sometimes—woke up for church on 
Sundays, woke as a child to help milk 
the cows on my grandparents’ farm— 
but we certainly don’t need the woke 
mob to shake us out of bed every day. 
Like all nations of people, we make 
plenty of mistakes and we have room 
to grow, but we Kansans are still proud 
of our American history. Rather than 
cancel it, we should embrace it. Amer-
ica has accomplished incredible things 
and defeated enemies of freedom. We 
should be proud of our history, hang 
onto it, and learn from it. 
God has given our Nation enormous 
bounty and blessings to help feed the 
world, maintain peace, and protect 
human rights. America has been called 
upon to be the salt of the Earth and re-
main a bright, burning candle, not hid-
den under a bushel. 
I believe our country will not fall 
from another military giant, nor will it 
succumb to economic failure created 
from foreign lands. Our greatest risk of 
failure comes from falling under our 
own weight if we continue to ignore 
the self-evident values our forefathers 
taught us. 
Indeed, if we continue paying too 
much attention to silly hyperbole, so-
cial media hype, and political correct-
ness, this Nation will struggle and not 
be the leader of the free world we were 
intended to be. 
Before I leave the subject of values, I 
want to share how important and per-
sonal the sanctity of life is to me. I had 
the honor, as an obstetrician, to de-
liver over 5,000 babies, and I promise I 
will work as hard in this Chamber to 
protect the lives of the unborn and our 
children as I did in the delivery room 
all those years. I will always lead on 
this issue and protect our values. 
Leadership is the quality I most re-
member my dad looking for and prais-
ing in others, and I have always tried 
to study and emulate great leaders. To 
this end, as I sometimes wander the 
Capitol looking for solitude and inspi-
ration, I am struck by one of my favor-
ite paintings hanging in the Capitol 
Rotunda. 
In this portrait, the artist depicts 
General George Washington, shortly 
after the Revolutionary War, surren-
dering his commission as an officer. 
And behind Washington, resting on an 
otherwise empty King’s throne, are the 
robes of a King, the robes he declined. 
The leadership lesson is that great 
leaders don’t seize more power when 
they 
see 
the 
opportunity. 
Three 
months into this 117th Congress, it ap-
pears that the power grab General 
Washington declined is now the major-
ity’s primary modus operandi. We have 
seen a record number of Executive or-
ders, the first partisan COVID relief 
bill, steps to grant DC statehood to tip 
the scales of power, an attempt to fed-
eralize elections and destroy election 
integrity with H.R. 1, and now a com-
mission to study expanding the Su-
preme Court. 
Like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz 
watching the grains of sand dropping 
through the hourglass, additional par-
tisan priorities remain on standby 
while the timing of dropping the ulti-
mate power grab—the elimination of 
the filibuster—is carefully weighed. 
The filibuster is meant to force both 
parties to work together to come up 
with long-lasting policies which help 
Americans. Without it, we will see tax 
laws and many other policies go up and 
down like a roller coaster, creating un-
certainty and making it impossible for 
long-term planning. 
We are witnessing what may be the 
most 
blatantly 
hypocritical 
policy 
switch we have ever seen, as most all 
Senators and the President have been 
on record previously in support of the 
filibuster. This flip-flop appears to be 
all in the name of greed and power. 
So while I come to the Senate intent 
on fighting against efforts to weaken 
our security, harm our economy, and 
diminish our American values, I also 
want to discuss what I am for. 
My favorite memories of growing up 
were spent in the great outdoors with 
the people I love the most: my friends 
and family. Make no mistake, I will do 
everything in my power to leave this 
world cleaner, safer, and healthier than 
I found it, and this can be accom-
plished while at the same time main-
taining affordable energy. 
Whether it is environmental policy 
or economic policy, we need to level 
the playing field, both at home and 
abroad. We must prioritize jobs for 
Americans, secure our supply chains, 
and continue to develop fair and recip-
rocal trade agreements. We must lower 
the cost of quality healthcare for all 
Americans. We must stop intellectual 
property theft, along with economic 
coercion, forced technology transfer, 
and cyber espionage. 
We must stop counterfeit products 
and illicit drugs from entering our Na-
tion. In addition, we must stop all cen-
sorship, especially the censorship of 
conservative thought that is under at-
tack. 
For our grandchildren’s sake, we 
must 
modernize 
our 
policies 
sur-
rounding Big Tech and social media be-
fore they engulf our society. 
So this Nation, still very young in 
the scheme of world history, we have 
our challenges, but as long as we stay 
true to our American values, we will 
get more right than we get wrong. But 
we have to learn to forgive our pasts 
and forgive each other. 
Over this Easter break, one of my 
sons told me something that made my 
heart go pitter-patter. He said: 
Dad, capitalism keeps America at the tip 
of the spear. 
Capitalism keeps America at the tip 
of the spear. You know, he was spot on. 
American innovation, our pioneer spir-
it, and hard work will always lead the 
way and bring victory over totali-
tarianism and singular thought and 
rule. 
Each and every American youth and 
young adult has their own story to

their shot at their American dream. 
While we cannot guarantee happiness 
for any of them, those of us in this 
Chamber can pave the way with an 
abundance of opportunity. 
As the dreams and stories of so many 
Americans are interweaved, this Amer-
ican portrait—this tapestry of blues 
and grays, of pastels and earth tones— 
will keep this Republic in good shape. 
It is our diversity that makes us great. 
As long as we pass on our American 
values that have seen this Nation 
through so many dark nights, we will 
succeed through current and future 
trials and conflicts. 
May God bless this great Republic. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, shortly 
before Easter, I joined a number of my 
colleagues on a visit to the border to 
get a firsthand look at the crisis that 
we are facing. And make no mistake, 
this is a crisis. Customs and Border 
Protection apprehensions at our south-
ern border last month were at their 
highest level in nearly 20 years—20 
years. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
reported more than 172,000 encounters 
with individuals attempting to cross 
our southern border in March alone. 
And that is just the individuals they 
encountered. We don’t know how many 
individuals came across without being 
identified and are currently residing il-
legally in our country. 
Nearly 19,000 unaccompanied children 
crossed our southern border in March 
alone, the largest number ever re-
corded in a single month. That is 19,000 
children making an incredibly dan-
gerous journey without their parents, 
at the mercy of smugglers, human traf-
fickers, or any other dangerous indi-
vidual that they might encounter. 
Needless to say, the surge at our bor-
der is having very serious effects. Bor-
der Patrol agents have been pulled off 
the border to deal with the influx of 
migrants and unaccompanied children, 
leaving the borders undermanned. And 
the government is straining to deal 
with processing the massive number of 
people who have come across the bor-
der. One facility that we visited was at 
16 times its allotted capacity. 
The administration has had to deploy 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency—that is right, our govern-
ment’s disaster recovery Agency—to 
help deal with the influx of unaccom-
panied children. And the Department 
of Health and Human Services has been 
forced to open emergency shelters and 
ask the Department of Defense for tem-
porary housing on bases. 
Despite 
the 
pandemic, 
adequate 
COVID safety measures have been un-
able to be maintained because the 
numbers needing to be housed have 
been so great. 
While the administration would like 
to attribute this crisis to the previous 
administration or anything but the 
current President’s policies, the truth 
is, President Biden bears a lot of the 
responsibility for the situation. His 
Presidential campaign made it clear 
that border security was not going to 
be one of his priorities. 
And since taking office, what signals 
have he and his administration sent? 
On his very first day in office, Presi-
dent Biden rescinded the declaration of 
a national emergency at our southern 
border; he halted construction on the 
border wall; and he rescinded a Trump 
administration order that called for 
the government to faithfully execute 
our immigration laws, including re-
movals for visa overstays and limiting 
funding to sanctuary cities—all on his 
first day. 
And that is not all. The President’s 
Department of Homeland Security also 
issued guidelines that same day paus-
ing deportations, except under certain 
conditions. The effect of President 
Biden’s actions was to declare to the 
world that the U.S. borders are effec-
tively open. 
That may or may not have been what 
President Biden and his administration 
intended, but it certainly has been the 
effect. The message received by pro-
spective migrants has been, if you can 
make it to the U.S. border and claim 
asylum, whether legitimate or not, 
even if you illegally cross the border, 
you are in. 
Trump administration policies like 
‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ and the third 
country asylum rule relieved pressure 
on our overburdened immigration case-
work and enforcement efforts at the 
southern border. They allowed for asy-
lum claims to be vetted long before in-
dividuals reached the U.S. border, re-
moving the need for people to uproot 
themselves and attempt a dangerous 
border crossing only to be sent back 
home again. 
But in his rush to distance himself 
from President Trump and appease the 
open borders wing of the Democratic 
Party, 
President 
Biden 
eliminated 
these policies, which has helped create 
the humanitarian crisis we are cur-
rently facing. 
Under 
the 
Biden 
administration, 
there is little deterrent or fear of pun-
ishment for those who seek to enter 
the country illegally, knowing that 
they can claim asylum and join the 
backlog of roughly 1.3 million cases 
while they wait in the United States. 
And the humanitarian crisis that we 
are seeing at the border is the result. 
President 
Biden 
and 
Democrats 
would like to present themselves as the 
compassionate 
alternative 
to 
the 
Trump administration, but there is 
nothing compassionate about policies 
that invite illegal immigration, that 
encourage people to attempt the dan-
gerous border crossing, to run the risk 
of death or injury or exploitation or 
disease. 
Inviting the surge at the border also 
shows a significant lack of compassion 
or consideration for Americans, par-
ticularly those in border communities. 
While many of those trying to cross 
our borders illegally are simply look-
ing for a better life, which is not an ex-
cuse for going outside our established 
legal pathways, there are also a lot of 
dangerous people—dangerous people at-
tempting illegal border crossings: drug 
traffickers, 
weapons 
traffickers, 
human traffickers, gang members. And 
when Border Patrol agents have been 
pulled off the border to help manage 
the immigration influx, it is not going 
to be too surprising if we discover that 
more of these dangerous individuals 
have made their way into our country. 
And that represents a real danger to 
Americans. 
Americans living in towns and cities 
along our southern border are at the 
greatest risk of having their commu-
nities 
disrupted 
by 
border-related 
criminal activity, but the effects of 
drug trafficking and other criminal ac-
tivity across our southern border are 
felt throughout our entire country. 
President Biden helped cause this cri-
sis. There are no ifs, ands, or buts 
about it. And he could start ending this 
crisis today by making it clear that his 
administration will enforce immigra-
tion laws and that the way to come to 
this country is to come legally. He 
could also help by recommitting our 
country to serious border security 
along our southern border, including 
construction, continued construction 
of the border wall. 
For the sake of the unaccompanied 
children and all those trying to cross 
our borders and for the sake of the 
Americans who have been endangered 
by his policies, I hope—I hope that 
President Biden will take action. 
I yield the floor.

to be a Member of the Council on Envi-

NOMINATION OF BRENDA MALLORY 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate has now invoked cloture on the 
nomination of Brenda Mallory, Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee to serve as the 
Chair of the White House Council on 
Environmental Quality. First, let me 
just say thank you. I want to express 
my thanks to—and I am sure, on behalf 
of Brenda Mallory—53 Senators who 
voted in favor of cloture so that we can 
move forward and now debate her nom-
ination. We thank each Senator who 
cast that supporting vote. But I rise in 
support of Ms. Mallory’s nomination to 
this important position. This is a posi-
tion a lot of folks have never heard of, 
but it is a hugely important one. And I 
urge our colleagues to now join me in 
supporting, in confirmation, a highly, 
highly qualified nominee as well. 
The Chair of the White House Council 
on Environmental Quality—or CEQ, as 
we call it—may not be the first posi-
tion many Americans think about 
when they consider consequential Pres-
idential appointments. But it is a cru-
cial body—critical body—with consid-
erable sway over our Nation’s health 
and environment. 
One of my mentors was a Republican 
named Russ Peterson, a great leader of 
the DuPont company for many years, 
Governor of Delaware, and later served 
as Chair of the White House Council on 
Environmental Quality during the ad-
ministrations of both Richard Nixon 
and Gerald Ford. 
Governor Peterson used to refer to 
his role as Chair at the Council on En-
vironmental Quality as similar to that 
of an orchestra leader, an orchestra 
conductor. He said: You don’t play the 
instruments as the Chair of the CEQ, 
but you try hard to ensure that every-
one in the orchestra is playing in har-
mony. The CEQ Chair coordinates ac-
tion across the entire government in 
order to ensure that Federal Agencies 
are working in harmony and that every 
Federal decision advances the objec-
tives of economic growth, of better 
public health, and of stronger environ-
mental quality. 
While CEQ Chairs do work much like 
an orchestra leader, a conductor, to 
achieve harmony across Federal Agen-
cies, they must also pursue balance. 
That balance includes at least three 
components: one, growing our econ-
omy; two, ensuring a just and healthy 
society; and, three, protecting our en-
vironment for current and future gen-
erations. Those are the clear objectives 
of CEQ as laid out in the National En-
vironmental Policy Act of 1969, known 
as NEPA, the landmark law that cre-
ated CEQ, often referred to as ‘‘the 
Magna Carta of environmental laws.’’ 
According to its six pages of statute, 
NEPA’s purpose includes—and I am 
going to quote—‘‘efforts which will pre-
vent or eliminate damage to the envi-
ronment and biosphere and stimulate 
the health and welfare of man.’’ I 
would add ‘‘and woman.’’ NEPA en-
shrines democracy by giving the Amer-
ican people a voice to help decide the 
fate of Federal decisions. For 50 years, 
NEPA has sought to ensure environ-
mental protection, public health, and 
the notion that the American people 
should have a say in the Federal deci-
sion-making process that affects their 
lives. 
Like our Constitution, NEPA is one 
of our Nation’s most enduring and rep-
licated laws. The same principles of de-
mocracy and citizen participation en-
shrined in our Constitution are also en-
shrined in NEPA. 
Sadly, the Trump administration’s 
CEQ largely walked away from the te-
nets of this 50-year-old law, issuing 
drastic rollbacks that undermine much 
of its very mission. Instead of advanc-
ing the CEQ’s three objectives—one, a 
more 
productive 
economy; 
two, 
a 
healthier society; and three, a cleaner 
environment—the previous administra-
tion 
sadly 
repeatedly 
compromised 
public health and environmental qual-
ity for the sake of less redtape. 
So one of the many tasks ahead for 
the next CEQ Chair will be to get us 
back on track—to harmonize our ef-
forts to address the climate crisis, safe-
guard public health, and ensure that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1913 
April 14, 2021 
we are treating others the way we want 
to be treated. If that sounds familiar, 
it should because that is the Golden 
Rule, which is found in every major re-
ligion on this planet. 
There are few people as well qualified 
to tackle this challenge as Brenda Mal-
lory. I believe that she is the kind of 
experienced, dedicated public servant 
that we need to lead CEQ at this crit-
ical time, not just for the Agency but 
for our Nation. 
Ms. Mallory is a deeply committed 
public servant with extensive experi-
ence under both Democratic and Re-
publican administrations. No stranger 
to CEQ, Ms. Mallory served there for a 
number of years after an impressive 
tenure of more than a decade at EPA, 
including under President George W. 
Bush. She has earned respect from both 
sides of the aisle, and, as the former 
General Counsel for CEQ, she already 
knows the Agency inside and out. 
Her experience and her reputation as 
a collaborative, pragmatic leader help 
to explain why she has garnered broad 
bipartisan 
support 
among 
environ-
mental leaders who have served before 
her. Get this—13 past Republican CEQ 
and 
EPA 
appointees, 
including 
a 
former CEQ Chair, and 4 different Re-
publican 
EPA 
Administrators 
have 
publicly praised Ms. Mallory and urged 
her confirmation. Now, that doesn’t 
happen every day, as the Presiding Of-
ficer knows. But among those former 
Republican EPA Administrators who 
have urged her confirmation are these: 
Bill Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman, 
Michael Leavitt, Stephen Johnson, and 
James Connaughton. 
Ms. Mallory has also earned the sup-
port of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
I will say that again. Ms. Mallory also 
earned the support of the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce—and a whole bushel of 
environmental groups across this land. 
She has represented business inter-
ests in the past as an attorney in pri-
vate practice, so she understands the 
importance of timely and well-coordi-
nated environmental reviews, which 
are crucial for getting investments in 
telecommunications and in infrastruc-
ture off the ground. 
Ms. Mallory’s expertise will be crit-
ical to the task that lies ahead. In ad-
dition to restoring balance at CEQ and 
its mission, the next Chair at CEQ will 
address a number of pressing crises fac-
ing our Nation today. Let me mention 
some of them. They include the ongo-
ing COVID–19 pandemic, and they in-
clude the worst economy since the 
Great Depression, as well as the endur-
ing problem and challenge of racial in-
justice. All three—all three of these 
crises are compounded by a fourth, and 
that is the climate crisis. 
We have no time to waste. We must 
tackle the climate crisis with convic-
tion and with urgency. My home State 
of Delaware, which I am privileged to 
represent, certainly cannot wait any 
longer. We happen to be the lowest 
lying State in America. Our State is 
sinking, and the seas around us are ris-
ing. 
This is felt by other States across the 
country too. Climate change is an issue 
that hits red States and blue States 
alike. Our colleagues JOHN NEELY KEN-
NEDY
and BILL
CASSIDY, from Lou-
isiana, tell me that Louisiana loses— 
get this—a football field of wetlands to 
rising sea levels every 100 minutes. 
Let me mention that again. Lou-
isiana loses a football field of wetlands 
to rising sea levels every 100 minutes. 
In another part of the country, the 
midwestern part of the country, last 
year, hurricane-force winds flattened 
over half—over half of the corn and 
soybean crop in Iowa, literally in the 
span of about a week, maybe even in a 
span of about a day. 
Out on the west coast, wildfires raged 
across California as big as the size of 
Rhode Island, while floods in Florida 
damaged homes, and roads and deadly 
ice storms a month or two ago left mil-
lions in Texas stranded without power 
or water. 
Natural disasters and extreme weath-
er don’t discriminate; they impact all 
of us. Brenda Mallory knows this. She 
understands the gravity of the situa-
tion and the immense challenge she 
has ahead of her, should she be con-
firmed. I know she is ready to seize the 
opportunity ahead of her in this role. 
She also knows that the laws we 
write and decisions we make can affect 
who faces the brunt of the con-
sequences. For too long, communities 
of color have disproportionately suf-
fered from our environmental policies. 
From chemical contaminants in drink-
ing water to toxic air pollution from 
our roads and our factories, our most 
marginalized citizens are too often ex-
posed to environmental public health 
risks and left behind by our invest-
ments and policies. 
We need to work to improve environ-
mental outcomes for all Americans— 
all Americans. Brenda Mallory at the 
helm of CEQ can play the leadership 
role that is needed in addressing envi-
ronmental justice and meeting the 
challenges of climate change in a way 
that will lift up all communities and 
achieve a brighter, more equitable fu-
ture for each one of them. 
As we address the crises we face, we 
have an opportunity to improve peo-
ple’s lives today and for future genera-
tions. To do that, we need principled, 
enlightened leaders. We need leaders 
who are humble, not haughty; leaders 
who have the heart of a servant and un-
derstand that their job is to serve, not 
be served; leaders who unite, not di-
vide; leaders who build bridges, not 
walls. 
I am confident that Brenda Mallory 
is just that kind of leader. She will 
bring integrity. She will bring honor 
and humility to her role just as she has 
done in her decades of service to this 
country. As Chair of the Council on En-
vironmental Quality, she will be a lead-
er who brings people together to form 
lasting solutions to the challenges that 
we face today. 
With that in mind, I strongly urge 
each of our colleagues to join me in 
supporting her confirmation. I thank 
again those who voted for cloture a few 
minutes ago. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it 
has been just over 2 months since we 
transferred majority rule to President 
Biden and the Democrats, and they 
have made it very clear that not even 
their most radical policy proposals are 
up for debate. They just want to push 
things through. In fact, based on what 
we have seen, I am willing to go on the 
record as saying that they see any pos-
sibility of defeat as an impermissible 
challenge to their hold on power, and 
they have got quite a long enemies’ 
list. 
You will recall that, back in 2016, 
after Donald Trump won the election, 
liberal activists blamed the electoral 
college for their many campaign fail-
ures. 
In 2020, even as the count came down 
in their favor, the attacks continued. 
Faced with the possibility of constitu-
tionalist, conservative judicial nomi-
nees, the Supreme Court also became a 
source of righteous panic. In the wake 
of the 2020 election, activists were 
quick to demand that their new major-
ity break the structure of the Court 
and transform it into a rubberstamp 
for radical policies that don’t stand a 
chance 
of 
surviving 
this 
Chamber 
under regular order. 
Just this year, when faced with a 
much slimmer majority than, I am 
sure, they expected, many of my Demo-
cratic colleagues reversed their posi-
tions on the filibuster. Suddenly, the 
procedural backstop so many of them 
had once vowed to protect—this was an 
important check against the tyranny 
of the majority—was, all of a sudden, 
nothing more than a racist relic of Jim 
Crow America. So we are left to as-
sume, I suppose, that tyranny started 
to look pretty good in the face of such 
a slim majority. 
Yet the filibuster isn’t the only Sen-
ate institution that came under fire. 
Debate over a Federal minimum wage 
increase grew so unhinged that many 
Democrats suggested firing the Parlia-
mentarian and replacing her with 
someone who was willing to deploy his 
or her own rubberstamp. Just this 
week, news broke that Senate Demo-
crats are now toying with the idea of 
firing the Director of the Congressional 
Budget Office. For what? For the 
unpardonable sin of doing his job. 
If you don’t like the score, fire the 
scorekeeper. If you don’t like the 
standard, wipe it off the books. If you 
don’t like the institution, just burn it 
to the ground. 
It is a familiar curriculum now re-
flected in the Democrats’ latest effort 
to demolish and rebuild the country in 
their own radical image. They call it 
the For the People Act, but the basic 
premise of S. 1 is that, in order to se-
cure our elections, we have no choice

April 14, 2021 
but to take electoral power away from 
the people and put it in the hands of 
politicians and bureaucrats. It is a top- 
down approach that, if implemented, 
would centralize control over elections 
in direct contravention to the Con-
stitution, destroy barriers to voter 
fraud, and enable radical activists to 
harass and intimidate their political 
opponents. It is the sort of power grab 
you would expect a cartoon villain to 
conduct, but here we are, debating this 
in the U.S. Senate. 
When you dive into the specifics, it 
really gets worse. Here are some things 
that it would do. 
The bill would, indeed, ban voter ID 
requirements and force States to allow 
ballot harvesting schemes. 
The Federal Election Commission, 
which for the moment is a balanced, bi-
partisan Agency, would morph into a 
partisan, prosecutorial body, ready to 
be weaponized against the political mi-
nority. 
Instead of living or dying by the sup-
port of loyal donors, under this new 
scheme, political campaigns would re-
ceive public money payouts, which 
they could then use to promote what-
ever message they pleased no matter 
how objectionable it might be to the 
taxpayers, who would be funding those 
campaigns. 
Speaking of those donors, if you have 
ever wondered who was behind a par-
ticular campaign, this bill has you cov-
ered. It includes new restrictions on 
political speech in the form of a donor 
disclosure mandate. Say goodbye to 
anonymous political activity in the 
tradition of the Federalist Papers and 
the civil rights movement. This is can-
cel culture on steroids, and if the 
Democrats have their way, this is what 
is coming to a precinct near you. 
Of course, the centralization of power 
on this scale will require a laundry list 
of regulations, and on that front, S. 1 
does not disappoint. The requirements 
shoveled onto local and State officials 
are so burdensome and impractical 
that I refuse to believe anyone involved 
in the drafting has ever staffed a poll-
ing place. Certainly, they have never 
served as volunteers on a county elec-
tion commission. That is something I 
had the honor of doing a couple of dec-
ades ago. 
If they get their way, the same auto-
matic 
registration 
procedures 
that 
failed voters in California and in Illi-
nois are coming to a county elections 
office in your neighborhood. 
Felons will regain their right to vote 
in Federal elections, but no one seems 
willing to explain how they expect 
State officials to prevent them from 
voting in down-ballot races. 
Elections 
officials will have the 
pleasure of purchasing new paper- 
backed voting machines just as soon as 
those machines come into existence. 
That is right. This bill mandates the 
use of technology that hasn’t hit the 
marketplace. 
Speaking of theoretical technology, 
for some reason, the drafters of this 
bill also thought it would be a good 
idea to force States to invent new tech-
nology to support automated voter reg-
istration by phone. 
Elections are not easy events to 
stand up. County officials and volun-
teers work year-round to ensure that 
polling places are staffed and safe, that 
machines are functional, and that vol-
unteers are well trained to recognize il-
legal electioneering and fraud. Over 
the years, State and local authorities 
have found their own solutions to these 
challenges. When those solutions fail, 
we have the ability to implement Fed-
eral backstops against voter suppres-
sion and election mishandling. 
Everyone has his own role to play. 
These roles are outlined in the Con-
stitution for a reason—because the 
Founders knew that any detached Fed-
eral bureaucracy would lack the com-
petence to solve the unique logistical 
challenges my Democratic colleagues 
are trying to use as proof that Congress 
must step in to burn down yet another 
institution of our democracy. That is 
the constitutional imperative of the 
States to set the time, place, and man-
ner of elections. 
If we continue to go down this road, 
this partisan fever dream will become 
codified chaos that will trickle all the 
way down to the precinct level and ir-
reparably erode confidence in the elec-
toral process. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President and my 
colleagues, there is a saying about Af-
ghanistan: that we have turned the 
corner toward victory so many times 
that we are spinning in circles. 
During the beginning of my time in 
Congress, I went to Afghanistan to 
visit our troops and military leadership 
about every 2 years. Each time I went, 
I was met by a new, capable, impres-
sive general who had just started his 
yearlong tour, who told me that the 
last general did it wrong and that, this 
time, everything was going to be dif-
ferent. I remember coming back from 
my third trip to Afghanistan—I think 
it was in 2011—convinced that it was 
time to leave. The primary mission had 
been accomplished. Within a few years 
of our invasion, al-Qaida in Afghani-
stan had been reduced to a shell of its 
former self, and we had really shifted 
to a new mission: nation-building. At 
the outset, there was reason for us to 
stay and engage in that mission and to 
work with the new Afghan Government 
to help get it on its own feet, but, by 
2011, that mission had, for all intents 
and purposes, become a permanent one. 
Now, after 20 years of war and 
handwringing about when the right 
time is to leave, we have to acknowl-
edge some basic truths: Our military 
presence in Afghanistan is not creating 
the conditions necessary to eradicate 
the Taliban or the conditions necessary 
to create a fully functional Afghan 
military or government. 
In fact, the facts on the ground would 
tell you the opposite is true: The 
longer we stay, the more powerful the 
Taliban becomes and the less willing 
the Afghan Government appears to be 
to make the hard choices to stand on 
its own. 
We can pretend that another year is 
going to change this, but it won’t. 
‘‘Just a little bit more time’’ has be-
come the rinse-and-repeat phrase of the 
Afghanistan hawks, but to stay any 
longer is really—let’s be honest—a de-
cision to stay forever, and that is 
something the American people do not 
support. 
I want to tell you one story from my 
trip to Afghanistan in 2011 that helped 
to confirm my belief that something 
was very wrong about our policy there. 
I went with a bipartisan delegation. I 
was in the House at the time. We vis-
ited a far-off Province in western Af-
ghanistan—a 
small 
town 
called 
Parmakan—and we were there to visit 
a group of Army commandos who 
toured us around this village. They 
were protecting the farmers in this vil-
lage from Taliban attack. They at-
tested to us that the attacks had large-
ly stopped, and in the place of those at-
tacks had matured a commerce be-
tween the Taliban forces that sur-
rounded the village and the farmers of 
the village. As we walked around this 
village, we made our way through 
fields of these beautiful, beautiful, 
colorful flowers. 
I turned to my colleague next to me, 
and I asked him if he had a sense as to 
what this crop was. 
He said: I think I do, but let’s con-
firm. 
So we asked one of the village elders 
what they were harvesting in these 
fields. 
Poppy, he told us. 
Our U.S. military forces were pro-
tecting the poppy trade in this western 
Province of Afghanistan—in fact, pro-
tecting the ability of the Taliban to 
come in and purchase that poppy in 
order to fuel the insurgency that we 
were fighting. Our troops were literally 
being utilized to protect the revenue 
source of our enemy. And so no wonder 
our policy in Afghanistan appears cir-
cular. In many ways, it is and it has 
been for a very long time. 
But even for those who disagree with 
me and contest that our presence there 
has actually helped facilitate the sur-
vival of the Taliban, what evidence is 
there that staying for another few 
years is going to make the key dif-
ference? 
The American war in Afghanistan is 
nearly 20 years old. It is the longest 
war in U.S. history, outlasting the 
Civil War, the Spanish-American War, 
World War I, World War II, and the Ko-
rean war combined. 
The United States and other inter-
national donors have invested an ex-
traordinary amount of money and ef-
fort and blood to help stand up a func-
tioning Afghan Government and civil 
society. And yet that government has

April 14, 2021 
failed to get widespread support from 
the Afghan people. There are many rea-
sons for this, but there is one big one: 
corruption. And the billions upon bil-
lions of dollars that are pumped into 
the Afghan economy by U.S. taxpayers 
often never find their way to actually 
helping the people of that country. Too 
much of our aid has been syphoned off 
by local leaders and unintentionally we 
have helped establish a system of cor-
ruption that has become so pervasive 
and so predatory that people have, 
frankly, 
become 
less 
resistant 
to 
Taliban inroads. 
Without a functioning police force, 
local Governors establish their own mi-
litias, and the mafia-style system that 
has developed has led to this vast drug 
trafficking network, fueled by corrup-
tion and that poppy production I 
talked about. 
This 
has 
distorted 
Afghanistan’s 
economy, and it has, frankly, neutral-
ized a lot of our economic aid. And yet 
the United States often, over the 
course of the last 20 years, has toler-
ated these warlords, these drug traf-
fickers, and these corrupt defense con-
tractors inside Afghanistan because we 
consider the enemy of our enemy to be 
our friend. Our entire mission there 
has often been built on a self-defeating 
strategy. 
In fact, what began as a vital mission 
to eliminate the threat of those who 
attacked us on September 11 has now, 
in some ways, become a symbol of 
nearly everything that is wrong with 
American foreign policy. Our armed 
presence in Afghanistan epitomizes 
this hubristic myth around the power 
of U.S. troops abroad; that they can 
completely dismantle terrorist net-
works by force, install and cultivate a 
stable democratic government, and 
eliminate rampant corruption and ille-
gal drug cultivation. 
Two decades and nearly $2 trillion 
dollars of spending later, we have seen 
the limitations of those fantastical as-
sumptions. Our generals have offered 
PowerPoint 
presentation 
after 
PowerPoint presentation on how this 
time it is going to be different, but it 
never is because the failure really isn’t 
in the execution. The failure has been 
in the design. 
A few thousand troops—and that is 
what we have there today—cannot de-
liver security and political stability to 
a complex, multicultural, multilingual 
nation, long resistant to centralized 
rule, on the other side of the world. 
We were right to pursue the al-Qaida 
terrorists who attacked us on Sep-
tember 11, but that mission is com-
pleted, and it is time to face facts 
about the limitations of American 
military power in Afghanistan and 
bring our troops home. 
Now, let’s be clear, al-Qaida still 
wants to harm the United States, but 
the threat that they pose today is no-
where near what it was 20 years ago 
when they attacked our Embassies in 
Kenya and Tanzania, bombed the USS 
Cole, and killed thousands of Ameri-
cans on September 11. 
Intelligence estimates tell us that in 
Afghanistan, there may be only 200, 
300, maybe 400 al-Qaida members total. 
The organization is no longer capable 
of planning large-scale attacks against 
the United States. That is what our in-
telligence 
estimates 
tell 
us. 
And, 
frankly, there are far more al-Qaida 
members today in other countries, like 
Yemen, for instance. Does that mean 
that we should also plant huge num-
bers of U.S. troops in every place where 
there are security vacuums to elimi-
nate the terrorist threat from those 
countries? Of course not. 
After two decades of the War on Ter-
ror, we have made a ton of mistakes, 
but we have also gotten a lot better in 
terms of our intelligence capabilities 
and our ability to strike against a ter-
rorist threat absent a huge in-country 
presence. Why not apply that lesson 
learned to Afghanistan? 
To their credit, the Trump adminis-
tration was right to finally call it like 
it is and state that the U.S. presence in 
Afghanistan couldn’t and shouldn’t 
continue forever. 
But as usual, the Trump team didn’t 
put in the work to ensure that we could 
do this responsibly by their deadline of 
May 1. So a 4-month extension, an-
nounced by President Biden, will give 
us the space needed, not to magically 
accomplish what we haven’t been able 
to do in 20 years but to realistically 
chart out the operational plans for 
pulling out the 2,500 troops whom we 
still have there. 
Now, finally, I want to be honest. 
When we withdraw, there is a real pos-
sibility the situation in Afghanistan is 
going to get worse. It is likely that 
fighting between the Afghan Govern-
ment and the Taliban escalates. At 
that point, either the Afghan Govern-
ment will have to lead the fight with-
out the crutch of American support or 
the government could collapse. 
But this is the key point: That has 
been the dynamic for the last 15 years, 
and it is going to continue to be the 
dynamic for the next 15 years. It 
wouldn’t be any different if we had 
stayed for another 5 years, another 20 
years, or another year. There is simply 
no evidence to suggest that things are 
going to change. After 20 years and bil-
lions of dollars of investment in the Af-
ghan Government, the onus has to be 
on them to get their act together and 
to earn the support of the people. 
And one last point, being in Afghani-
stan is a choice, a choice to not focus 
on other theaters that present more se-
rious threats to international norms, 
global stability, and American secu-
rity. It bogs America down having 2,500 
troops there and thousands more con-
tractors and billions of dollars. It bogs 
us down in a theater that, frankly, just 
matters less to us today than it did 
years ago. 
Just within the last few days, China 
has leveled new threats to the terri-
torial integrity of its neighbors; Russia 
is amassing thousands of troops on the 
border of Ukraine; and there are new 
worries about a potential attack on 
NATO member states. 
And remember, counterterrorism of-
ficials and our daily newsfeed remind 
us that the most serious threat to 
America today is actually not from for-
eign terrorist organizations but from 
domestic groups. 
We spend more money than any other 
nation in the world on security, but 
even given the gargantuan size of our 
global military footprint, we cannot 
and should not be everywhere. We need 
to make choices every now and again, 
and right now it is fantasy, not reality, 
that undergirds an argument to stay in 
Afghanistan for another 10 years or 5 
years or even another year. 
A big part of being President is mak-
ing tough choices, and today President 
Biden has made the right one to end 
this war. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the new 
power dynamic in Washington has 
brought about a frenzy of proposed in-
stitutional changes by our friends 
across the aisle. 
The American people elected a Demo-
cratic President, that is true; they re-
duced the Democratic majority in the 
House; and elected a 50–50 Senate. In 
all of Congress, there are seven more 
Democrats than Republicans. That is 
all—7 out of 535 Members. 
Despite these tight margins, our 
friends on the other side have tried to 
characterize this new power dynamic 
as a mandate, and they have floated a 
tsunami of rule changes to go along 
with it. First came the push to elimi-
nate the filibuster. 
Just a few years ago, the idea of such 
a radical change terrified our Demo-
cratic colleagues. We certainly didn’t 
do it when we were in a position to do 
it, notwithstanding the encouragement 
of President Trump. 
When Republicans held control of the 
Senate, the House, and the White 
House, as our Democratic colleagues do 
now, our friends on the other side of 
the aisle feared the filibuster would 
come tumbling down. They were so 
concerned, in fact, that 33 of our col-
leagues signed on to a letter insisting 
that the filibuster be preserved. Leader 
MCCONNELL agreed. He never wavered 
to pressure from anyone, even the 
President, to eliminate the filibuster. 
He has been around this Chamber and 
this Senate a long time, and he knows 
that what goes around comes around. 
As the leader correctly noted, Demo-
crats didn’t just spend the last 4 years 
supporting the filibuster, they took 
every advantage of the opportunity for

the minority to stop legislation they 
disagreed with. They spent 4 years 
using it. 
Our Democratic colleagues employed 
the filibuster to kill quite a number of 
Republican bills on pandemic relief, 
government funding, pro-life legisla-
tion, police reform, and the list goes on 
and on. 
Despite the fact our friends on the 
other side of the aisle consistently 
praised and utilized the filibuster in re-
cent years, now, after the election of 
2020, they seem to have reversed 
course. Since the political tides have 
changed, so, too, have the views of 
many Senate Democrats. 
In recent months, one of our col-
leagues referred to the filibuster as 
making a mockery of American democ-
racy. 
I happen to remember at John Lew-
is’s funeral—the great civil rights 
icon—even former President Obama 
called it a ‘‘relic of Jim Crow,’’ argu-
ably giving permission to Democrats to 
call the filibuster a racist obstacle to 
making progress in the country. 
Another Senator said that the fili-
buster had deep roots in racism, even 
though last summer Democrats used 
this tool to block an anti-lynching bill. 
The entire debate has ballooned be-
yond reason, and the past few months 
have been a game of ‘‘will they or 
won’t they’’ when it comes to elimi-
nating the filibuster. 
You know, the filibuster has very 
sound origins. It forces us to do what I 
think the American people would want 
us to do anyway, and that is to work 
together. It forces us to do that. And 
building consensus is hard, as we all 
know. 
Well, we now have confirmation that 
our Democratic colleagues do not have 
the votes. Last week, Senator MANCHIN 
of West Virginia took to the pages of 
the Washington Post and said he will 
not support eliminating or weakening 
the filibuster. He has been here long 
enough to know that what you can do 
in the majority will have consequences 
when you are in the minority, as you 
eventually will be if you are here long 
enough. 
I was appreciative of what Senator 
MANCHIN said in those pages. I am sure 
it wasn’t easy. I am sure there is a lot 
of pressure on him to be expedient, to 
jam things through on a partisan basis, 
and I appreciate his willingness to 
stand up. 
I agree with the Senator from Ari-
zona, who said: We don’t have a rule 
problem. We have a people problem. We 
have a behavior problem. 
We need to restore bipartisan co-
operation. There is no chance that will 
happen if everything in the Senate is 
jammed through along party lines. 
The filibuster is designed to protect 
our country from the continual change 
of who is in the majority and who is in 
the minority and to provide the Amer-
ican people a chance to plan their 
lives. If anything that can be done in 
one election can be undone in the next 
election, that is an invitation to chaos. 
Unfortunately, the list of proposed 
institutional changes doesn’t end with 
the filibuster. Over the last few years, 
our friends on the other side of the 
aisle have also set their sights on the 
Supreme Court. 
We all remember the day a sitting 
Member of this body threatened two 
Supreme Court Justices by name. As 
the Justices were debating a case, the 
current majority leader said, on the 
steps of the Supreme Court: 
You have released the whirlwind and you 
will pay the price. 
Well, I think he realized the error in 
making that statement because he 
then followed up with—well, this isn’t 
the point where he realized the error 
because he doubled down on it. He said: 
You won’t know what hit you if you go for-
ward with these awful decisions. 
Well, we know this wasn’t an isolated 
incident. It is true that the majority 
leader tried to walk back his words 
later after he realized how intemperate 
and inappropriate they were when di-
rected at two sitting members of the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
We don’t have to remember too far in 
the past to know how the words we 
speak here in Congress and as public 
officials—the impact they can have on 
other people’s minds and perceptions, 
especially those who are not particu-
larly stable in the first place. 
Well, several of our Democratic col-
leagues filed an amicus brief in which 
they threatened the Supreme Court 
with retribution unless they got the 
outcome that they wanted. 
Thank goodness our Founders de-
signed the Federal Government with 
three separate but equal branches. 
Through this system of checks and bal-
ances, they sought to prevent any one 
branch of government from forcing its 
will on the other two. Standing up on 
the steps of the Supreme Court and 
issuing threats to the Justices that 
they must do what you want or else is 
certainly 
not 
consistent 
with 
the 
Founders’ vision. 
Let me be clear. An independent judi-
ciary is the crown jewel of our Con-
stitution and our constitutional Re-
public—an independent judiciary. In 
the words of Supreme Court Justice 
John Roberts, ‘‘We should celebrate 
our strong and independent judiciary 
as a source of national unity and sta-
bility.’’ But now, even this hallowed in-
stitution is being attacked by our 
Democratic colleagues unless they get 
the result they want. They are trying 
to intimidate the members of the Su-
preme Court. 
Then there is the most recent discus-
sion—threat, really—about packing the 
Supreme Court with additional mem-
bers. The push to pack the Supreme 
Court has been a mainstay of the far 
left for years, but it has now made its 
way into the Biden administration. 
Previously, 
throughout 
his 
cam-
paign, President Biden refused to weigh 
in on this topic. He knew how explosive 
this was, this threat to pack the Court, 
to make it a political body, to elimi-
nate its role as an independent judici-
ary. Well, he refused to weigh in on it 
during the campaign, and I have no 
doubt this was an important strategic 
decision. He realized how offensive that 
would be to the voters he hoped would 
vote for him in 2020. A poll last fall 
found that less than one-third of Amer-
icans support increasing the number of 
Justices on the Supreme Court. 
The President previously said he is 
‘‘not a fan of court packing.’’ In fact, 
he called it a ‘‘bonehead idea.’’ He re-
ferred to President Roosevelt’s pro-
posal to pack the Court as a ‘‘terrible, 
terrible mistake.’’ But now President 
Biden has appeared to have embraced 
this ‘‘bonehead idea’’ and this ‘‘ter-
rible, terrible mistake’’ that he con-
demned previously. 
The first step was last week when he 
created a Commission to examine add-
ing members to the Supreme Court of 
the United States above the current 
nine. This decision and announcement 
came despite the fact that Justices on 
both sides appointed by Presidents on 
both sides of the aisle have affirmed 
the integrity of the Supreme Court 
with just nine members. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who 
was an icon for the liberals on the 
Court and many people in America, 
said: ‘‘Nine seems to be a good num-
ber.’’ 
Just last week, Justice Breyer said 
that the Court’s authority depends on 
‘‘a trust that the court is guided by 
legal principle, not politics.’’ He said 
that these types of changes would 
erode the trust that the American peo-
ple must have in the highest Court in 
the land. 
The American people simply won’t 
have faith in an independent judiciary 
if one side is adding names to the ros-
ter so that they can game the outcome. 
They need to get involved in the legis-
lative process if they want to make 
policy, 
not 
try 
to 
make 
politics 
through the judiciary, through the Su-
preme Court. 
So I would urge President Biden to 
heed his own words that he delivered 
with such conviction during his time 
on the Judiciary Committee when he 
said that President Roosevelt’s deci-
sion ‘‘put in question for an entire dec-
ade the independence of the most sig-
nificant body . . . in this country.’’ 
Well, unfortunately, the power grab 
doesn’t stop there. The single biggest 
legislative goal of our friends on the 
other side of the aisle is an attempted 
takeover of State election laws. That is 
in spite of the fact that article I of the 
Constitution explicitly gives the States 
the power to regulate the ‘‘times, 
places, and manner of holding elec-
tions.’’ Yet this massive bill creates a 
one-size-fits-all mandate that every 
State must follow. It preempts State 
law, but I doubt it would ultimately be 
held up as constitutional because of 
the explicit guarantee that the States 
will regulate the time, manner, and 
place of holding elections. 
But there are also other changes that 
our Democratic colleagues—where they

seek to reap the benefit of a politicized 
Supreme Court and Federal Agencies. 
In this instance, the Federal Election 
Commission has six members, three 
from 
each 
party—intentionally 
de-
signed to be a tie vote if they vote 
along party lines, to protect the Com-
mission from partisan politics. 
We have learned that a fair and bal-
anced Commission, which has been the 
standard for many years, isn’t the gold 
standard for Democrats when they are 
in control of Congress and the White 
House. The election takeover bill in-
troduced by our Democratic colleagues 
would remove one of the seats held by 
a Republican member of the Commis-
sion and turn the FEC into a partisan 
body. No more equal representation. 
No more consensus building. Why both-
er with that if you can steamroll an 
agenda with no opposition? 
Then there is the taxpayer funding of 
political campaigns. Instead of can-
didates working to gain the support, 
the vote, the activism and contribu-
tions from their preferred candidate, 
our Democratic colleagues want the 
taxpayer to pay for those campaigns. 
And it is not even a dollar-for-dollar 
match. The American taxpayer would 
pay $6 dollars for every $1 dollar that 
was donated to a candidate. That 
means if someone donates 200 bucks to 
their preferred candidate, the Federal 
Government would match that with up 
to $1,200. Those are taxpayer dollars. 
That is money coming out of your 
pocket whether you support that can-
didate’s policies or not. 
On top of that, there are campaign 
vouchers proposed which would provide 
eligible voters with a $25 voucher to do-
nate to the campaign of their choosing. 
I would rather this funding support the 
people and organizations that really 
need it: crime victims, unaccompanied 
children on our border, domestic vio-
lence, shelters. There are far more ur-
gent needs for this money than our 
Democratic colleagues’ campaign ac-
count. 
Of course, this effort comes at a time 
when the House Democrats are already 
trying to overturn the results of an 
Iowa congressional election in order to 
boost their own numbers. 
This 
confluence 
of 
institutional 
changes isn’t about repairing a broken 
system; it is revolutionary. It is a revo-
lution. You can’t win every case before 
the Supreme Court? Well, just add 
some more liberal Justices. You can’t 
build support for legislation? Well, 
eliminate the filibuster and the need to 
build consensus and to work together 
on a bipartisan basis. You can’t win an 
election? Overturn the results and se-
cure government funding or taxpayer 
funding for your candidates. And to ce-
ment these changes for a generation, 
better throw in a complete partisan 
takeover of our election laws. 
Our Democratic friends are taking 
the saying ‘‘If you can’t win the game, 
change the rules’’ to a whole new level. 
This has been branded by propaganda, 
really, as a way to fix the system. Well, 
the system is not broken, and to the 
extent it needs reforms, it can be re-
formed at the State level, where the 
Constitution provides the authority for 
the States to run their elections. 
Well, I think it is important for the 
American people to understand exactly 
what is going on here. You can’t under-
stand what is going on here by just 
reading social media or watching cable 
news shows that reinforce your own 
bias. Unfortunately, our news these 
days seems to be like ships passing in 
the night, and people pick the channel 
that reaffirms their previous bias and 
doesn’t challenge people with ideas 
that perhaps they are not familiar with 
or don’t agree with, which is the way 
we ought to be dealing with each other. 
It is OK to disagree, but we ought to 
engage each other in a civil and re-
spectful manner and to work those out 
in the crucible of our democracy 
known as the Congress. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Ohio. 
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.’S LETTER FROM 
THE BIRMINGHAM JAIL 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, it is 
an honor to join my colleagues of both 
parties, 
starting 
with 
Reverend 
Warnock and five—two other Demo-
crats and three other Republicans on 
the floor today to read one of the great 
pieces of writing of the 20th century, 
Dr. King’s letter from the Birmingham 
jail. 
I thank Senator WARNOCK and Sen-
ators 
MURKOWSKI, 
Republican 
from 
Alaska; 
TOOMEY, 
Republican 
from 
Pennsylvania; PADILLA, our new col-
league from California, a Democrat; 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO, in her fifth 
year in the Senate, a Democrat from 
the Presiding Officer’s home State of 
Nevada; and Senator CASSIDY
from 
Louisiana, a Republican. They will be 
joining me today for this annual tradi-
tion. 
Our former colleague, Doug Jones 
from Alabama, began this reading 3 
years ago. I joined him on the floor. He 
asked me last year after his election to 
carry on this tradition in the years 
ahead. I am honored to take that re-
sponsibility because Dr. King’s words 
are as powerful, as beautiful, and as 
relevant as ever. 
One of many, many, many incisive 
things that Dr. King said was that we 
live in a 10-day world where people for-
get about public events 10 days later. 
Not so for him, not so for his words, 
and certainly not so from the letter 
from the Birmingham jail. 
Twelve years after Dr. King’s assas-
sination, 
when 
Cesar 
Chavez 
was 
thrown in jail, Dr. King’s widow, 
Coretta Scott King, said: 
You cannot keep truth in . . . jail. . . . 
Truth and justice leap barriers, and in their 
own way, reach the conscience of the people. 
She said that is what Dr. King said, 
were his words. 
In April 1963, Dr. King was detained 
at the Birmingham jail for leading a 
series of peaceful protests and boy-
cotts. The goal was to put pressure on 
the business community to end dis-
crimination in hiring for local jobs. 
Some White ministers from Alabama 
had taken issues with his boycotts. 
They supported civil rights, they said. 
They told him to slow down, don’t 
move too fast, and don’t demand too 
much all at once. Dr. King, of course, 
as we know, rejected that premise. 
That is what this letter is all about. 
It is about demanding justice now. We 
can’t wait around and hope the prob-
lems in families’ lives will solve them-
selves. It is up to all of us as citizens, 
as leaders, as members of our churches 
and our communities to get to work. 
Dr. King made that point more elo-
quently and more persuasively, cer-
tainly, than I can, but we will read this 
note—we will read his words. Senator 
WARNOCK will begin, followed by Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI and four other Sen-
ators. 
Senator WARNOCK. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague, Senator 
BROWN, for bringing us together in this 
way, reading from a letter from a Bir-
mingham jail by Dr. King, April 16, 
1963. Dr. King writes: 
MY DEAR FELLOW CLERGYMEN: 
While confined here in the Birmingham 
city jail, I came across your recent state-
ment calling my present activities ‘‘unwise 
and untimely.’’ 
Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of 
my working ideas. If I sought to answer all 
of the criticisms that cross my desk, my sec-
retaries would have little time for anything 
other than such correspondence in the course 
of a day, and I would have no time for con-
structive work. But since I feel you are men 
of genuine good will and that your criticisms 
are sincerely set forth, I will try to answer 
your statement in what I hope will be pa-
tient and reasonable terms. 
I think I should indicate why I am here in 
Birmingham, since you have been influenced 
by the view which argues against ‘‘outsiders 
coming in.’’ I have the honor of serving as 
president of the Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference, an organization operating 
in every southern state, with headquarters 
in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty- 
five 
affiliated 
organizations 
across 
the 
South, and one of them is the Alabama 
Christian Movement for Human Rights. Fre-
quently we share staff, educational and fi-
nancial resources with our affiliates. Several 
months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham 
asked us to be on call to engage in a non-
violent direct action program if such were 
deemed necessary. We readily consented, and 
when the hour came we lived up to our prom-
ise. So I, along with several members of my 
staff, am here because I was invited here. I 
am here because I have organizational ties 
here. 
But more basically, I am in Birmingham 
because injustice is here. Just as the proph-
ets of the eighth century B.C. left their vil-
lages and carried their ‘‘thus saith the Lord’’ 
far beyond the boundaries of their home 
towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his 
village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of 
Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco 
Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the 
gospel of freedom beyond my home town. 
Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the 
Macedonian call for aid.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1918 
April 14, 2021 
Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelat-
edness of all communities and states. I can-
not sit idly by in Atlanta and not be con-
cerned about what happens in Birmingham. 
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice ev-
erywhere. We are caught in an inescapable 
network of mutuality, tied in a single gar-
ment of destiny. Whatever affects one di-
rectly, affects all indirectly. Never again can 
we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 
‘‘outside agitator’’ idea. Anyone who lives 
inside the United States can never be consid-
ered an outsider anywhere within its bounds. 
You deplore the demonstrations taking 
place in Birmingham. But your statement, I 
am sorry to say, fails to express a similar 
concern for the conditions that brought 
about the demonstrations. I am sure that 
none of you would want to rest content with 
the superficial kind of social analysis that 
deals merely with effects and does not grap-
ple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate 
that demonstrations are taking place in Bir-
mingham, but it is even more unfortunate 
that the city’s white power structure left the 
Negro community with no alternative. 
In any nonviolent campaign there are four 
basic steps: collection of the facts to deter-
mine whether injustices exist; negotiation; 
self purification; and direct action. We have 
gone through all these steps in Birmingham. 
There can be no gainsaying the fact that ra-
cial injustice engulfs this community. Bir-
mingham is probably the most thoroughly 
segregated city in the United States. Its ugly 
record of brutality is widely known. Negroes 
have experienced grossly unjust treatment in 
the courts. There have been more unsolved 
bombings of Negro homes and churches in 
Birmingham than in any other city in the 
nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of 
the case. On the basis of these conditions, 
Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the 
city fathers. But the latter consistently re-
fused to engage in good faith negotiation. 
Then, last September, came the oppor-
tunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham’s 
economic community. In the course of the 
negotiations, certain promises were made by 
the merchants—for example, to remove the 
stores’ humiliating racial signs. On the basis 
of 
these 
promises, 
the 
Reverend 
Fred 
Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Ala-
bama Christian Movement for Human Rights 
agreed to a moratorium on all demonstra-
tions. As the weeks and months went by, we 
realized that we were the victims of a broken 
promise. A few signs, briefly removed, re-
turned; the others remained. As in so many 
past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, 
and the shadow of deep disappointment set-
tled upon us. We had no alternative except to 
prepare for direct action, whereby we would 
present our very bodies as a means of laying 
our case before the conscience of the local 
and the national community. Mindful of the 
difficulties involved, we decided to under-
take a process of self purification. We began 
a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we 
repeatedly asked ourselves: ‘‘Are you able to 
accept the blows without retaliating?’’ ‘‘Are 
you able to endure the ordeal of jail?’’ 
We decided to schedule our direct action 
program for the Easter season, realizing that 
except for Christmas, this is the main shop-
ping period of the year. Knowing that a 
strong economic-withdrawal program would 
be the by product of direct action, we felt 
that this would be the best time to bring 
pressure to bear on the merchants for the 
needed change. 
Then it occurred to us that Birmingham’s 
mayoral election was coming up in March, 
and we speedily decided to postpone action 
until after election day. When we discovered 
that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eu-
gene ‘‘Bull’’ Connor, had piled up enough 
votes to be in the run off, we decided again 
to postpone action until the day after the 
run off so that the demonstrations could not 
be used to cloud the issues. Like many oth-
ers, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, 
and to this end, we endured postponement 
after postponement. Having aided in this 
community need, we felt our direct action 
program could be delayed no longer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I continue the reading of the letter 
from Birmingham jail: 
You may well ask: ‘‘Why direct action? 
Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn’t ne-
gotiation a better path?’’ You are quite right 
in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the 
very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent di-
rect action seeks to create such a crisis and 
foster such a tension that a community 
which has constantly refused to negotiate is 
forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to 
dramatize the issue that it can no longer be 
ignored. My citing the creation of tension as 
part of the work of the nonviolent resister 
may sound rather shocking. But I must con-
fess that I am not afraid of the word ‘‘ten-
sion.’’ I have earnestly opposed violent ten-
sion, but there is a type of constructive, non-
violent 
tension 
which 
is 
necessary 
for 
growth. Such as Socrates felt that it was 
necessary to create a tension in the mind so 
that individuals could rise from the bondage 
of myths and half truths to the unfettered 
realm of creative analysis and objective ap-
praisal, so must we see the need for non-
violent gadflies to create the kind of tension 
in society that will help men rise from the 
dark depths of prejudice and racism to the 
majestic heights of understanding and broth-
erhood. The purpose of our direct action pro-
gram is to create a situation so crisis packed 
that it will inevitably open the door to nego-
tiation. I therefore concur with you in your 
call for negotiation. Too long has our be-
loved Southland been bogged down in a trag-
ic effort to live in a monologue rather than 
dialogue. 
One of the basic points in your statement 
is that the action that I and my associates 
have taken in Birmingham is untimely. 
Some have asked: ‘‘Why didn’t you give the 
new city administration time to act?’’ The 
only answer that I can give to this query is 
that the new Birmingham administration 
must be prodded about as much as the out-
going one, before it will act. We are sadly 
mistaken if we feel that the election of Al-
bert Boutwell as mayor will bring the mil-
lennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell 
is a much more gentle person than Mr. Con-
nor, they are both segregationists, dedicated 
to the maintenance of the status quo. I have 
hoped that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable 
enough to see the futility of massive resist-
ance to desegregation. But he will not see 
this without pressure from devotees of civil 
rights. My friends, I must say to you that we 
have not made a single gain in civil rights 
without determined legal and nonviolent 
pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact 
that privileged groups seldom give up their 
privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see 
the moral light and voluntarily give up their 
unjust posture; but as Reinhold Niebuhr has 
reminded us, groups tend to be more im-
moral than individuals. 
We know through painful experience that 
freedom is never voluntarily given by the op-
pressor; it must be demanded by the op-
pressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a 
direct action campaign that was ‘‘well 
timed’’ in the view of those who have not 
suffered unduly from the disease of segrega-
tion. For years now I have heard the word 
‘‘Wait!’’ It rings in the ear of every Negro 
with piercing familiarity. This ‘‘Wait’’ has 
almost always meant ‘‘Never.’’ We must 
come to see, with one of our distinguished 
jurists, that ‘‘justice too long delayed is just 
denied.’’ 
We have waited for more than 340 years for 
our constitutional and God given rights. The 
nations of Asia and Africa are moving with 
jetlike speed toward gaining political inde-
pendence, but we still creep at horse and 
buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at 
a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those 
who have never felt the stinging darts of seg-
regation to say, ‘‘Wait.’’ But when you have 
seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and 
fathers at will and drown your sisters and 
brothers at whim; when you have seen hate 
filled policeman curse, kick and even kill 
your black brothers and sisters; when you 
see the vast majority of your twenty million 
Negro brothers smothering in an airtight 
cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent 
society . . . when you take a cross country 
drive and find it necessary to sleep, night 
after night, in the uncomfortable corners of 
your automobile because no motel will ac-
cept you; when you are humiliated day in 
and day out by nagging signs reading 
‘‘white’’ and ‘‘colored’’; when your first 
name becomes [an expletive], your middle 
named becomes ‘‘boy’’ (however old you are) 
and your last name becomes ‘‘John,’’ and 
your wife and mother are never given the re-
spected title ‘‘Mrs.’’; when you are harried 
by day and haunted by night by the fact that 
you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe 
stance, never quite knowing what to expect 
next, and are plagued with inner fears and 
outer resentments; when you are forever 
fighting 
a 
degenerating 
sense 
of 
‘‘nobodiness’’—then you will understand why 
we find it difficult to wait. 
There comes a time when the cup of endur-
ance runs over, and men are no longer will-
ing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I will continue the reading of 
Martin Luther King’s letter from the 
Birmingham jail. 
I hope, sirs, you can understand our legiti-
mate and unavoidable impatience. You ex-
press a great deal of anxiety over our will-
ingness to break laws. This is certainly a le-
gitimate concern. Since we so diligently 
urge people to obey the Supreme Court’s de-
cision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the 
public schools, at first glance it may seem 
rather paradoxical for us consciously to 
break laws. One may well ask: ‘‘How can you 
advocate breaking some laws and obeying 
others?’’ The answer lies in the fact that 
there are two types of laws: Just and unjust. 
I would be the first to advocate obeying just 
laws. One has not only a legal but a moral 
responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, 
one has a moral responsibility to disobey un-
just laws. I would agree with St. Augustine 
that ‘‘an unjust law is no law at all.’’ 
Now, what is the difference between the 
two? How does one determine whether a law 
is just or unjust? A just law is a man made 
code that squares with the moral law or the 
law of God. An unjust law is a code that is 
out of harmony with the moral law. To put 
it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An 
unjust law is a human law that is not rooted 
in eternal law and natural law. Any law that 
uplifts human personality is just. Any law 
that degrades human personality is unjust. 
All segregation statutes are unjust because 
segregation distorts the soul and damages 
the personality. It gives the segregator a 
false sense of superiority and the segregated 
a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to 
use the terminology of the Jewish philoso-
pher Martin Buber, substitutes an ‘‘I it’’ re-
lationship for an ‘‘I though’’ relationship and

April 14, 2021 
ends up relegating persons to the status of 
things. Hence, segregation is not only politi-
cally, economically and sociologically un-
sound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul 
Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not 
segregation an existential expression of 
man’s tragic separation, his awful estrange-
ment, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that 
I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of 
the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; 
and I can urge them to disobey segregation 
ordinances, for they are morally wrong. 
Let us consider a more concrete example of 
just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code 
that a numerical or a power majority group 
compels a minority group to obey but does 
not make binding on itself. This is difference 
made legal. By the same token, a just law is 
a code that a majority compels a minority to 
follow and that it is willing to follow itself. 
This is sameness made legal. Let me give an-
other explanation. A law is unjust if it is in-
flicted on a minority that, as a result of 
being denied the right to vote, had no part in 
enacting or devising the law. Who can say 
that the legislature of Alabama which set up 
that State’s segregation laws was democrat-
ically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts 
of devious methods are used to prevent Ne-
groes from becoming registered voters, and 
there are some counties in which, even 
though Negroes constitute a majority of the 
population, not a single Negro is registered. 
Can 
any 
law 
enacted 
under 
such 
cir-
cumstances be considered democratically 
structured? 
Sometimes a law is just on its face and un-
just in its application. For instance, I have 
been arrested on a charge of parading with-
out a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in 
having an ordinance which requires a permit 
for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes 
unjust when it is used to maintain segrega-
tion and to deny citizens the First Amend-
ment privilege of peaceful assembly and pro-
test. 
I hope you are able to see the distinction I 
am trying to point out. In no sense do I advo-
cate evading or defying the law, as would the 
rabid segregationist. That would lead to an-
archy. One who breaks an unjust law must 
do so openly, lovingly, and with a willing-
ness to accept the penalty. I submit that an 
individual who breaks a law that conscience 
tells him is unjust, and who willingly ac-
cepts the penalty of imprisonment in order 
to arouse the conscience of the community 
over its injustice, is in reality expressing the 
highest respect for the law. 
Of course, there is nothing new about this 
kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced 
sublimely 
in 
the 
refusal 
of 
Shadrach, 
Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of 
Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher 
moral law was at stake. It was practiced su-
perbly by the early Christians, who were 
willing to face hungry lions and the excru-
ciating pain of chopping blocks rather than 
submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman 
Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a 
reality today because Socrates practiced 
civil disobedience. In our own nation, the 
Boston Tea Party represented a massive act 
of civil disobedience. 
We should never forget that everything 
Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ‘‘legal’’ and 
everything the Hungarian freedom fighters 
did in Hungary was ‘‘illegal.’’ It was ‘‘ille-
gal’’ to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s 
Germany. Even so, I am sure that had I lived 
in Germany at the time, I would have aided 
and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today 
I lived in a Communist country where cer-
tain principles dear to the Christian faith 
are suppressed, I would openly advocate dis-
obeying that country’s antireligious laws. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, con-
tinuing the reading of the letter from 
the Birmingham jail. 
I must make two honest confessions to 
you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. 
First, I must confess that over the past few 
years I have been gravely disappointed with 
the white moderate. 
I have almost reached the regrettable con-
clusion that the Negro’s great stumbling 
block in his stride toward freedom is not the 
White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux 
Klanner, but the white moderate, who is 
more devoted to ‘‘order’’ than to justice; who 
prefers a negative peace which is the absence 
of tension to a positive peace which is the 
presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘‘I 
agree with you in the goal you seek, but I 
cannot agree with your methods of direct ac-
tion’’; who paternalistically believes he can 
set the timetable for another man’s freedom; 
who lives by a mythical concept of time and 
who constantly advises the Negro to wait for 
a ‘‘more convenient season.’’ Shallow under-
standing from people of goodwill is more 
frustrating than absolute misunderstanding 
from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance 
is much more bewildering than outright re-
jection. 
I had hoped that the white moderate would 
understand that law and order exist for the 
purpose of establishing justice and that when 
they fail in this purpose they become the 
dangerously structured dams that block the 
flow of social progress. 
I had hoped that the white moderate would 
understand that the present tension in the 
South is a necessary phase of the transition 
from an obnoxious negative peace, in which 
the Negro passively accepted his unjust 
plight, to a substantive and positive peace, 
in which all men will respect the dignity and 
worth of human personality. Actually, we 
who engage in nonviolent direct action are 
not the creators of tension. We merely bring 
to the surface the hidden tension that is al-
ready alive. We bring it out in the open, 
where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a 
boil that can never be cured so long as it is 
covered up but must be opened with all its 
ugliness for the natural medicines of air and 
light, injustice must be exposed, with all the 
tension its exposure creates, to the light of 
human conscience and the air of national 
opinion before it can be cured. 
In your statement you assert that our ac-
tions, even though peaceful, must be con-
demned because they precipitate violence. 
But is this a logical assertion? Isn’t this like 
condemning a robbed man because his pos-
session of money precipitated the evil act of 
robbery? Isn’t this like condemning Socrates 
because his unswerving commitment to 
truth and his philosophical inquiries precip-
itated the act by the misguided populace in 
which they made him drink hemlock? Isn’t 
this like condemning Jesus because his 
unique God consciousness and never ceasing 
devotion to God’s will precipitated the evil 
act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, 
as the federal courts have consistently af-
firmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to 
cease his efforts to gain his basic constitu-
tional rights because the quest may precipi-
tate violence. Society must protect the 
robbed and punish the robber. I had also 
hoped that the white moderate would reject 
the myth concerning time in relation to the 
struggle for freedom. I have just received a 
letter from a white brother in Texas. He 
writes: ‘‘All Christians know that the col-
ored people will receive equal rights eventu-
ally, but it is possible that you are in too 
great a religious hurry. It has taken Christi-
anity almost two thousand years to accom-
plish what it has. The teachings of Christ 
take time to come to earth.’’ Such an atti-
tude stems from a tragic misconception of 
time, from the strangely irrational notion 
that there is something in the very flow of 
time that will inevitably cure all ills. 
Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be 
used either destructively or constructively. 
More and more I feel that the people of ill 
will have used time much more effectively 
than have the people of good will. We will 
have to repent in this generation not merely 
for the hateful words and actions of the bad 
people but for the appalling silence of the 
good people. Human progress never rolls in 
on wheels of inevitability; it comes through 
the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-
workers with God, and without this hard 
work, time itself becomes an ally of the 
forces of social stagnation. We must use time 
creatively, in the knowledge that the time is 
always ripe to do right. Now is the time to 
make real the promise of democracy and 
transform our pending national elegy into a 
creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the 
time to lift our national policy from the 
quicksand of racial injustice to the solid 
rock of human dignity. 
You speak of our activity in Birmingham 
as extreme. At first I was rather dis-
appointed that fellow clergymen would see 
my nonviolent efforts as those of an extrem-
ist. I began thinking about the fact that I 
stand in the middle of two opposing forces in 
the Negro community. One is a force of com-
placency, made up in part of Negroes who, as 
a result of long years of oppression, are so 
drained of self respect in the sense of 
‘‘somebodiness’’ that they have adjusted to 
segregation; and in part of a few middle-class 
Negroes who, because of a degree of aca-
demic and economic security and because in 
some ways they profit by segregation, have 
become insensitive to the problems of the 
masses. The other force is one of bitterness 
and hatred, and it comes perilously close to 
advocating violence. It is expressed in the 
various black nationalist groups that are 
springing up across the nation, the largest 
and best known being Elijah Muhammad’s 
Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro’s 
frustration over the continued existence of 
racial discrimination, this movement is 
made up of people who have lost faith in 
America, who have absolutely repudiated 
Christianity, and who have concluded that 
the white man is an incorrigible ‘‘devil.’’ 
I have tried to stand between these two 
forces, saying that we need emulate neither 
the ‘‘do nothingism’’ of the complacent nor 
the hatred and despair of the black nation-
alist. For there is the more excellent way of 
love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to 
God that, through the influence of the Negro 
church, the way of nonviolence became an 
integral part of our struggle. If this philos-
ophy had not emerged, by now many streets 
of the South would, I am convinced, be flow-
ing with blood. And I am further convinced 
that if our white brothers dismiss as ‘‘rabble 
rousers’’ and ‘‘outside agitators’’ those of us 
who employ nonviolent direct action, and if 
they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, 
millions of Negroes will, out of frustration 
and despair, seek solace and security in 
black nationalist ideologies—a development 
that would inevitably lead to a frightening 
racial nightmare. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. 
Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed 
forever. The yearning for freedom eventually 
manifests itself, and that is what has hap-
pened to the American Negro. Something 
within has reminded him of his birthright of 
freedom, and something without has re-
minded him that it can be gained. Con-
sciously or unconsciously, he has been

S1920 
April 14, 2021 
caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his 
black brothers of Africa and his brown and 
yellow brothers of Asia, South America and 
the Caribbean, the United States Negro is 
moving with a sense of great urgency toward 
the promised land of racial justice. If one 
recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed 
the Negro community, one should readily 
understand why public demonstrations are 
taking place. The Negro has many pent up 
resentments and latent frustrations, and he 
must release them. So let him march; let 
him make prayer pilgrimages to the city 
hall; let him go on freedom rides—and try to 
understand why he must do so. If his re-
pressed emotions are not released in non-
violent ways, they will seek expression 
through violence; this is not a threat but a 
fact of history. 
So I have not said to my people: ‘‘Get rid 
of your discontent.’’ Rather, I have tried to 
say that this normal and healthy discontent 
can be channeled through into the creative 
outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now 
this approach is being termed extremist. But 
though I was initially disappointed at being 
categorized as an extremist, as I continued 
to think about the matter I gradually gained 
a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was 
not Jesus an extremist for love: ‘‘Love your 
enemies, bless them that curse you, do good 
to them that hate you, and pray for them 
which despitefully use you, and persecute 
you.’’ Was not Amos an extremist for justice: 
‘‘Let justice roll down like waters and right-
eousness like an ever flowing stream.’’ Was 
not Paul an extremist for the Christian gos-
pel: ‘‘I bear in my body the marks of the 
Lord Jesus.’’ Was not Martin Luther an ex-
tremist: ‘‘Here I stand; I cannot do other-
wise, so help me God.’’ And John Bunyan: ‘‘I 
will stay in jail to the end of my days before 
I make a butchery of my conscience.’’ And 
Abraham Lincoln: ‘‘This nation cannot sur-
vive half slave and half free.’’ And Thomas 
Jefferson: ‘‘We hold these truths to be self 
evident, that all men are created equal . . .’’ 
So the question is not whether we will be ex-
tremists, but what kind of extremists we will 
be. Will we be extremists for hate or for 
love? Will we be extremists for the preserva-
tion of injustice or for the extension of jus-
tice? 
In that dramatic scene on Calvary’s hill 
three men were crucified. We must never for-
get that all three were crucified for the same 
crime—the crime of extremism. Two were 
extremists for immorality, and thus fell 
below their environment. The other, Jesus 
Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and 
goodness, and thereby rose above his envi-
ronment. 
Perhaps the South, the nation and the 
world are in dire need of creative extremists. 
I had hoped the white moderate would see 
this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; per-
haps I expected too much. I suppose I should 
have realized that few members of the op-
pressor race can understand the deep groans 
and passionate yearnings of the oppressed 
race, and still fewer have the vision to see 
that injustice must be rooted out by strong, 
persistent and determined action. I am 
thankful, however, that some of our white 
brothers in the South have grasped the 
meaning of this social revolution and com-
mitted themselves to it. They are still all 
too few in quantity, but they are big in qual-
ity. Some—such as Ralph McGill, Lillian 
Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, 
Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle—have 
written about our struggle in eloquent and 
prophetic terms. Others have marched with 
us down nameless streets of the South. They 
have languished in filthy, roach infested 
jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of po-
licemen 
who 
view 
them 
as 
‘‘dirty 
niggerlovers.’’ Unlike so many of their mod-
erate brothers and sisters, they have recog-
nized the urgency of the moment and sensed 
the need for powerful ‘‘action’’ antidotes to 
combat the disease of segregation. Let me 
take note of my other major disappointment. 
I have been so greatly disappointed with 
the white church and its leadership. Of 
course, there are some notable exceptions. I 
am not unmindful of the fact that each of 
you has taken some significant stands on 
this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stal-
lings, for your Christian stand on this past 
Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your wor-
ship service on a nonsegregated basis. I com-
mend the Catholic leaders of this state for 
integrating Spring Hill College several years 
ago. 
But despite these notable exceptions, I 
must honestly reiterate that I have been dis-
appointed with the church. I do not say this 
as one of those negative critics who can al-
ways find something wrong with the church. 
I say this as a minister of the gospel, who 
loves the church; who was nurtured in its 
bosom; who has been sustained by its spir-
itual blessings and who will remain true to it 
as long as the cord of life shall lengthen. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
thank Senator BROWN for including me 
on this reading. It is a tremendous 
honor. I will continue. 
When I was suddenly catapulted into the 
leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, 
Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be 
supported by the white church. I felt that 
the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the 
South would be among our strongest allies. 
Instead, some have been outright oppo-
nents, refusing to understand the freedom 
movement and misrepresenting its leaders; 
all too many others have been more cautious 
than courageous and have remained silent 
behind the anesthetizing security of stained 
glass windows. In spite of my shattered 
dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope 
that the white religious leadership of this 
community would see the justice of our 
cause and, with deep moral concern, would 
serve as the channel through which our just 
grievances could reach the power structure. I 
had hoped that each of you would under-
stand. But again I have been disappointed. 
I have heard numerous southern religious 
leaders admonish their worshipers to comply 
with a desegregation decision because it is 
the law, but I have longed to hear white min-
isters declare: ‘‘Follow this decree because 
integration is morally right and because the 
Negro is your brother.’’ In the midst of bla-
tant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I 
have watched white churchmen stand on the 
sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and 
sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a 
mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial 
and economic injustice, I have heard many 
ministers say: ‘‘Those are social issues, with 
which the gospel has no real concern.’’ And I 
have watched many churches commit them-
selves to a completely other worldly religion 
which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinc-
tion between body and soul, between the sa-
cred and the secular. 
I have traveled the length and breadth of 
Alabama, Mississippi and all the other 
southern states. On sweltering summer days 
and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at 
the South’s beautiful churches with their 
lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have be-
held the impressive outlines of her massive 
religious education buildings. Over and over 
I have found myself asking: ‘‘What kind of 
people worship here? Who is their God? 
Where were their voices when the lips of 
Governor Barnett dripped with words of 
interposition and nullification? Where were 
they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion 
call for defiance and hatred? Where were 
their voices of support when bruised and 
weary Negro men and women decided to rise 
from the dark dungeons of complacency to 
the bright hills of creative protest?’’ 
Yes, these questions are still in my mind. 
In deep disappointment I have wept over the 
laxity of the church. But be assured that my 
tears have been tears of love. There can be 
no deep disappointment where there is not 
deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could 
I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique po-
sition of being the son, the grandson and the 
great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the 
church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How 
we have blemished and scarred that body 
through social neglect and through fear of 
being nonconformists. 
There was a time when the church was 
very powerful—in the time when the early 
Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy 
to suffer for what they believed. In those 
days the church was not merely a thermom-
eter that recorded the ideas and principles of 
popular opinion; it was a thermostat that 
transformed the mores of society. Whenever 
the early Christians entered a town, the peo-
ple in power became disturbed and imme-
diately sought to convict the Christians for 
being ‘‘disturbers of the peace’’ and ‘‘outside 
agitators.’’ 
But the Christians pressed on, in the con-
viction that they were ‘‘a colony of Heaven,’’ 
called to obey God rather than Man. Small 
in number, they were big in commitment. 
They were too God-intoxicated to be ‘‘astro-
nomically intimidated.’’ By their effort and 
example they brought an end to such ancient 
evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests. 
Things are different now. So often the con-
temporary church is a weak, ineffectual 
voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is 
an arch defender of the status quo. Far from 
being disturbed by the presence of the 
church, the power structure of the average 
community is consoled by the church’s si-
lent—and often even vocal—sanction of 
things as they are. 
But the judgment of God is upon the 
church as never before. If today’s church 
does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of 
the early church, it will lose its authen-
ticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be 
dismissed as an irrelevant social club with 
no meaning for the twentieth century. Every 
day I meet young people whose disappoint-
ment with the church has turned into out-
right disgust. 
Perhaps I have once again been too opti-
mistic. Is organized religion too inextricably 
bound to the status quo to save our nation 
and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith 
to the inner spiritual church, the church 
within the church, as the true ekklesia and 
the hope of the world. But again I am thank-
ful to God that some noble souls from the 
ranks of organized religion have broken 
loose from the paralyzing chains of con-
formity and joined us as active partners in 
the struggle for freedom. They have left 
their secure congregations and walked the 
streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They 
have gone down the highways of the South 
on tortuous rides for freedom. 
Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some 
have been dismissed from their churches, 
have lost the support of their bishops and 
fellow ministers. But they have acted in the 
faith that right defeated is stronger than 
evil triumphant. Their witness has been the 
spiritual salt that has preserved the true 
meaning of the gospel in these troubled 
times. 
They have carved a tunnel of hope through 
the dark mountain of disappointment. I hope 
the church as a whole will meet the chal-
lenge of this decisive hour. But even if the

church does not come to the aid of justice, I 
have no despair about the future. I have no 
fear about the outcome of our struggle in 
Birmingham, even if our motives at present 
are misunderstood. We will reach the goal of 
freedom in Birmingham and all over the na-
tion, because the goal of America is freedom. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Continuing the read-
ing of a letter from a Birmingham jail. 
Abused and scorned though we may be, our 
destiny is tied up with America’s destiny. 
Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we 
were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched 
the majestic words of the Declaration of 
Independence across the pages of history, we 
were here. For more than two centuries, our 
forebears labored in this country without 
wages; they made cotton king; they built the 
homes of their masters while suffering gross 
injustice and shameful humiliation—and yet 
out of a bottomless vitality they continued 
to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible 
cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the op-
position we now face will surely fail. We will 
win our freedom because the sacred heritage 
of our nation and the eternal will of God are 
embodied in our echoing demands. Before 
closing I feel impelled to mention one other 
point in your statement that has troubled 
me profoundly. You warmly commended the 
Birmingham police force for keeping ‘‘order’’ 
and ‘‘preventing violence.’’ I doubt that you 
would have so warmly commended the police 
force if you had seen its dogs sinking their 
teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I 
doubt that you would so quickly commend 
the policemen if you were to observe their 
ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes 
here in the city jail; if you were to watch 
them push and curse old Negro women and 
young Negro girls; if you were to see them 
slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; 
if you were to observe them, as they did on 
two occasions, refuse to give us food because 
we wanted to sing our grace together. I can-
not join you in your praise of the Bir-
mingham police department. 
It is true that the police have exercised a 
degree of discipline in handling the dem-
onstrators. In this sense they have con-
ducted themselves rather ‘‘nonviolently’’ in 
public. But for what purpose? To preserve 
the evil system of segregation. Over the past 
few years I have consistently preached that 
nonviolence demands that the means we use 
must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have 
tried to make it clear that it is wrong to use 
immoral means to attain moral ends. But 
now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or 
perhaps even more so, to use moral means to 
preserve immoral ends. Perhaps, Mr. Connor 
and his policemen had been rather non-
violent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in 
Albany, Georgia, but they have used the 
moral means of nonviolence to maintain the 
immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. El-
liot has said: ‘‘The last temptation is the 
greatest treason: To do the right deed for the 
wrong reason.’’ I wish you had commended 
the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of 
Birmingham for their sublime courage, their 
willingness to suffer, and their amazing dis-
cipline in the midst of great provocation. 
One day the South will recognize its real he-
roes. They will be the James Merediths, with 
the noble sense of purpose that enables them 
to face jeering and hostile mobs, and with 
the agonizing loneliness that characterizes 
the life of the pioneer. They will be old, op-
pressed battered Negro women symbolized in 
a seventy two year old woman in Mont-
gomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense 
of dignity and with her people decided not to 
ride segregated buses, and who responded 
with ungrammatical profundity to one who 
inquired about her weariness: ‘‘My feets is 
tired, but my soul is at rest.’’ They will be 
the young high school and college students, 
the young ministers of the gospel and a host 
of 
their 
elders, 
courageously 
and 
non-
violently sitting in at lunch counters and 
willingly going to jail for conscience’ sake. 
One day the South will know that when 
these disinherited children of God sat down 
at lunch counters, they were in reality 
standing up for what is best in the American 
dream and for the most sacred values in our 
Judeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing 
our nation back to those great wells of de-
mocracy which were dug deep by the found-
ing founders in their formulation of the Con-
stitution and the Declaration of Independ-
ence. 
Never before have I written so long a 
letter. I’m afraid it is much too long to 
take your precious time. I can assure 
you that it would have been much 
shorter if I had been writing from a 
comfortable desk, but what else can 
one do when he is alone in a narrow jail 
cell, other than write long letters, 
think long thoughts, and pray long 
prayers? 
If I have said anything in this letter that 
overstates the truth and indicates an unrea-
sonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. 
If I have said anything that understates the 
truth and indicates my having a patience 
that allows me to settle for anything less 
than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me. I 
hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. 
I also hope that circumstances will soon 
make it possible for me to meet each of you, 
not as an integrationist or a civil-rights 
leader but as a fellow clergymen and a Chris-
tian brother. Let us all hope that the dark 
clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away 
and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be 
lifted from our fear drenched communities, 
and in some not too distant tomorrow, the 
radiant stars of love and brotherhood will 
shine over our great nation with all their 
scintillating beauty. 
Yours for the cause of Peace and Brother-
hood, 
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague from the neigh-
boring State, Senator TOOMEY, for join-
ing us. I thank all of my colleagues 
who 
were 
here 
today, 
Senators 
WARNOCK and MURKOWSKI, TOOMEY and 
CASSIDY, CORTEZ MASTO, and PADILLA 
for joining to read these powerful 
words today. 
This is about as diverse a group as we 
could assemble in the U.S. Senate, a 
group of seven Senators who really re-
flect our country today: a reverend in a 
Black church, the son of a union elec-
trical worker, a doctor from the Deep 
South, an Independent born in the 
Alaska country, a son of Mexican im-
migrants, a daughter of Mexican Amer-
icans who made this country home for 
a century, and a son of the Midwest 
whose father came from Mansfield, OH, 
and mother came from Mansfield, GA. 
We come from different backgrounds, 
and we disagree on many things, but 
we love this country—all seven us—and 
we know we can do better for the peo-
ple who make it work. 
Dr. King and the civil rights leaders 
of his generation did more than just 
about anyone to push this country to 
live up to our founding ideals and make 
the dream of America real for every-
one. 
Protesting, working for change, orga-
nizing, demanding our country to do 
better—those are some of the most pa-
triotic things all of us can do. That is 
Dr. King’s charge of this letter: 
Progress never rolls in on wheels of inevi-
tability. 
That is our charge. I think about the 
campaign Dr. King was waging when he 
was assassinated. You can’t forget he 
was martyred in Memphis when fight-
ing for some of the most exploited 
workers in this country, sanitation 
workers. He understood the deep con-
nection between workers’ rights and 
civil rights. As he put it, ‘‘What does it 
profit a man to be able to eat at an in-
tegrated lunch counter, if he doesn’t 
earn enough money to buy a ham-
burger and a cup of coffee?’’ 
Until all Americans have the dignity 
they have earned, Dr. King’s work will 
remain unfinished. That means paying 
all workers a living wage, giving them 
power over their schedules, providing 
good benefits and safety on the job, let-
ting them, if they choose, organize a 
union. That means all workers should 
get a fair share of the wealth they cre-
ate. It means recognizing the dignity of 
communities that Black Americans 
have built over generations. 
They were denied wealth and invest-
ment. The schools were underfunded. 
Banks wouldn’t lend. Highways tore 
down businesses and tore apart neigh-
borhoods in the Presiding Officer’s 
largest city in Milwaukee, as they did 
in the largest cities in my State: Co-
lumbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. 
In the face of all of that, Black Ohio-
ans and people all over the country 
built businesses and churches and vi-
brant neighborhoods and loving fami-
lies. But they should not have to do it 
on their own. 
As we emerge from this pandemic 
and we work together to build a 
stronger country out of this crisis, we 
can’t make the mistakes of the past. 
We learned in the Banking, Housing 
Committee this week that President 
Roosevelt’s collective bargaining laws 
and investment in housing with the 
creation of housing agencies created a 
middle class for Americans who look 
like me but didn’t create a middle class 
for a whole lot of other Americans. 
Think about the infrastructure in-
vestments that we made in the 1930s 
and the years after World War II. 
Think how we created millions of new 
homeowners and grew the middle class. 
Think of how we expanded economic 
security, with overtime and workers 
compensation and Medicare and Social 
Security. 
There is no reason we can’t do that 
again, the same thing again, but this 
time we bring along everyone. We in-
vest in all communities. We bring us 
closer to the society Dr. King envi-
sioned, where all labor—as he would 
say, where ‘‘all labor has dignity.’’ 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll. 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, on 
March 29, Vilma Kari was walking to 
church near Times Square in Manhat-
tan when a man pushed her to the 
ground and violently assaulted her in 
broad daylight. 
A silent video of the incident cap-
tured by a security camera inside a 
luxury apartment building showed the 
attack in vivid detail. In it, we can 
clearly see the assailant pushing Ms. 
Kari to the ground and kicking her re-
peatedly in the head and torso before 
leaving the scene. This video, which 
has gone viral, is disturbing enough to 
watch, but it doesn’t capture the full 
picture of what happened. Witnesses to 
the attack recounted the assailant’s re-
peatedly yelling ‘‘You don’t belong 
here’’ to Ms. Kari—an immigrant from 
the Philippines who has lived in our 
country for decades. 
Now recovering from multiple inju-
ries, including a broken pelvis, Vilma 
Kari has become one of the latest vic-
tims in a surging wave of hate crimes 
targeting the Asian-American, Pacific 
Islander 
community 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Over the last year, we have seen busi-
nesses defaced with anti-Asian graffiti, 
elders verbally accosted on the street, 
women assaulted, and eight people 
murdered in cold blood at Asian-owned 
businesses 
in 
Georgia 
during 
unprovoked attacks. All told, people of 
Asian descent have reported more than 
3,800 hate incidents across all 50 States 
and the District of Columbia. 
These attacks are disturbing and hor-
rifying, but they are, in many ways, a 
predictable and foreseeable outgrowth 
of the use of racist and inflammatory 
language, 
like 
‘‘Chinese 
virus,’’ 
‘‘Wuhan virus,’’ and ‘‘Kung flu,’’ to de-
scribe the COVID–19 pandemic. Last 
year, as some political leaders, includ-
ing the former President, started using 
this language, the FBI warned of a po-
tential surge in hate crime incidents 
targeting people of Asian descent. 
At the same time, public health ex-
perts warned of the danger of singling 
out the Asian-American community as 
being responsible for the virus. These 
warnings proved prophetic. A study re-
cently published by the American 
Journal of Public Health found there 
was a dramatic increase in tweets 
using anti-Asian phrases after the first 
time the former President tweeted 
using the hashtag ‘‘China virus’’ on 
March 16, 2020. 
This rise in hate crimes targeting 
AAPIs over the past year has shown 
the extent to which this inflammatory 
rhetoric has normalized racist atti-
tudes toward and the stigmatization of 
Asian Americans with devastating con-
sequences. The Center for the Study of 
Hate and Extremism, for example, as-
sessed that, in 16 of the Nation’s larg-
est cities, hate crimes targeting AAPIs 
spiked nearly 150 percent during the 
pandemic. 
The current dramatic rise in hate 
crimes 
targeting 
Asian 
Americans 
might be a recent development, but we 
all know that racism is never far below 
the surface in our country, sadly. Asian 
Americans have always been targeted 
as the ‘‘other’’ in our country—consid-
ered the perpetual ‘‘foreigner.’’ It is 
what drove the passage of the Chinese 
Exclusion Act of 1882 and is what led to 
the incarceration of 120,000 Japanese 
Americans during World War II. It is 
also what drove two Detroit auto-
workers, during the height of hysteria 
about 
Japan’s 
growing 
economic 
strength, to murder a Chinese-Amer-
ican man named Vincent Chin in 1982 
because they thought he was Japanese. 
Outrageously, neither of Vincent’s kill-
ers received prison time. Nearly 40 
years later, we can see clear parallels 
between the racism that motivated 
Vincent Chin’s murder and the ongoing 
surge in anti-Asian racism and hate 
crimes. We can also see the parallels in 
the wave of activism both unleashed. 
Today, the AAPI community is unit-
ing, once again, to confront this epi-
demic of racism, discrimination, and 
hate. We are marching, speaking out, 
and demanding action in cities and 
States across the country. As part of 
our activism, we are working to dispel 
the model minority myth that all 
Asians are successful and integrated in 
society. This racist and discriminatory 
stereotype devalues the struggles and 
experiences of an extraordinarily di-
verse community. The AAPI commu-
nity is comprised of people from more 
than 48 distinct ethnic groups who 
speak over 300 languages. Some of 
these groups have been in this country 
for over 100 years. Others have grown 
in size through waves of immigration 
in recent decades. 
Like other communities of color, ele-
ments of the AAPI community have 
traditionally suffered from a variety of 
health, economic, and other disparities 
for years, and the COVID–19 pandemic 
has only made them worse. AAPIs are 
contracting and dying from COVID–19 
at much higher rates than White Amer-
icans and at comparable rates with 
Black and Hispanic Americans. 
Our community has suffered too 
much over the past year from the two 
epidemics of racism and COVID, and 
confronting 
both 
will 
continue 
to 
present challenges, but it has been a 
relief to have a President capable of 
demonstrating care and empathy and 
who shares our sense of urgency in con-
fronting this wave of hate. 
In his first week as President, Joe 
Biden 
issued 
an 
executive 
memo-
randum that condemned racism, xeno-
phobia, and intolerance targeting the 
AAPI community and directed the Fed-
eral Government to actively combat it. 
In recent weeks, following the brutal 
murder of eight people, including six 
Asian women in Georgia, President 
Biden took additional action. He an-
nounced new investments for research 
into anti-Asian xenophobia through 
the National Science Foundation, di-
rected $50 million in support for vic-
tims of hate crimes, and established a 
COVID–19 equity task force to combat 
anti-Asian hate. 
Members of President Biden’s admin-
istration have followed his lead. Attor-
ney General Merrick Garland, for ex-
ample, 
pledged 
to 
prioritize 
hate 
crimes enforcement during his con-
firmation hearing and has taken addi-
tional steps to help local law enforce-
ment agencies investigate bias crimes. 
Under President Biden’s leadership, 
the executive branch is doing its part. 
Now it is time for us—it is time for 
Congress to act. 
I am encouraged that in just a few 
minutes, the Senate will vote to pro-
ceed to the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act 
on a strong bipartisan vote. This is not 
a controversial bill. It would focus Fed-
eral leadership to investigate and re-
port hateful acts of violence and pro-
vide resources for our communities to 
come together to take a stand against 
intolerance and hate. 
The COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act di-
rects the Attorney General to des-
ignate a person whose responsibility it 
will be to expedite review of anti-Asian 
hate crimes and report them. It also in-
structs DOJ to issue guidance to State 
and local law enforcement on cul-
turally appropriate public education 
campaigns and on the collection of 
data on hate crimes or incidents. Such 
culturally-sensitive, in-language out-
reach is an important element for 
strengthening trust and awareness in 
impacted communities, and it will help 
overcome established hesitancy to re-
port hate crimes or incidents to law en-
forcement. 
At a time when the AAPI community 
is under siege, this bill is an important 
signal that Congress is taking anti- 
Asian racism and hatred seriously. Sig-
nificantly, Democrats and Republicans 
are working together in good faith to 
come to consensus to pass this bill. For 
example, I wholeheartedly support a bi-
partisan amendment from Senators 
Blumenthal and Moran to attach their 
NO HATE Act to this bill. Their 
amendment improves the data collec-
tion and reporting of all hate crimes so 
that we can better understand their 
prevalence and implement effective 
policies to prevent them. Senator COL-
LINS and I are also working on addi-
tional language to broaden support for 
the bill. 
The ongoing wave of anti-Asian vio-
lence and hate crimes has touched vir-
tually every single member of the 
AAPI community. We are talking 
about millions of people in the AAPI 
community. Many of us are changing 
our daily routines. Until recently, I 
usually have my earbuds in, listening 
to an audio book whenever I leave my 
apartment to go for a walk. I don’t do 
that now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1923 
April 14, 2021 
An attack on one group in our coun-
try is truly an attack on all of us. By 
passing the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, 
we can come together on a bipartisan 
basis to show that the U.S. Senate will 
not be a bystander to the wave of rac-
ist, anti-Asian violence in our country. 
So let’s get it done together. 
I yield the floor.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT— 
MOTION TO PROCEED 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture 
having been invoked, the Senate will 
proceed to legislative session to con-
sider the motion to proceed to S. 937, 
which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. S. 937, a 
bill to facilitate the expedited review of 
COVID–19 hate crimes, and for other pur-
poses. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Ameri-
cans were horrified to witness a recent 
series of mass shootings involving the 
Asian-American and Pacific Islander 
community. On March 16, 2021, mass 
shootings occurred at three spas and 
massage parlors in the Atlanta metro-
politan area. Eight people were killed, 
six of whom were Asian-American 
women, and one other person was 
wounded. The suspect was taken into 
custody that day and has been charged 
with multiple counts of murder. The 
investigation 
is 
continuing 
as 
to 
whether the suspect should be addi-
tionally charged with hate crimes, if he 
deliberately targeted Asian Americans 
with this senseless violence. 
Unfortunately, this mass shooting is 
not an isolated incident in the United 
States in terms of hate speech, hate 
crimes, and violence against Asian 
Americans in our communities. Sadly, 
some political figures have used the 
ongoing COVID–19 pandemic to fan the 
flames of hate by promoting stereo-
types, fear, and xenophobia. Irration-
ally blaming Asian and Asian-Amer-
ican neighbors for the pandemic is sim-
ply wrong and reprehensible and can 
have deadly consequences. 
Let us remember that our Asian- 
American brothers and sisters are an 
integral part of the United Nations on 
so many levels. Our immigrant story 
and our diversity are some of our 
unique strengths, not weaknesses, of 
the United States of America. 
There are about 23 million Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders in the 
United States, constituting 7 percent 
of the population of our country. 
There are approximately 2 million 
Asian-American owned businesses that 
generate over $700 billion in annual 
revenue and employ millions of work-
ers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1924 
April 14, 2021 
Two million Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders are working on the 
frontlines of the COVID–19 pandemic as 
first responders and in healthcare, law 
enforcement, 
transportation, 
super-
markets, and other service industries. 
Our Asian-American brothers and sis-
ters are putting their lives on the line 
every day to help protect our commu-
nities during the pandemic. That is 
why it is so despicable to see the rise of 
anti-Asian rhetoric and hate speech by 
political leaders and others, which in-
evitably gives oxygen to extremist 
groups and individuals and gives li-
cense to individuals to commit hate 
crimes and acts of violence. 
The use of anti-Asian terminology 
and rhetoric related to COVID–19, such 
as the ‘‘Chinese virus,’’ the ‘‘Wuhan 
virus,’’ the ‘‘Kung flu’’—phrases often 
used by former President Trump and 
some of his followers—has perpetrated 
an anti-Asian stigma. The use of anti- 
Asian rhetoric has resulted in Asian 
Americans being harassed, assaulted, 
and scapegoated for the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Since January 2020, there has been a 
dramatic increase in reports of hate 
crimes and incidents against those of 
Asian descent throughout the Nation. 
According to a recent report, there 
were nearly 3,800 reported cases of anti- 
Asian 
discrimination 
related 
to 
COVID–19 between March 2020 and Feb-
ruary 2021. 
On April 3, 2021, the New York Times 
ran an analysis article on the rising 
tide of Asian-American violence enti-
tled ‘‘Swelling Anti-Asian Violence: 
Who is Being Attacked Where.’’ 
The article stated: 
Over the last year, in an unrelenting series 
of episodes . . . people of Asian descent have 
been pushed, beaten, kicked, spit on and 
called slurs. Homes and businesses have been 
vandalized. The violence has known no 
boundaries, spanning generations, income 
brackets and regions. . . . Those cases in-
clude the fatal attack of a Thai man in Janu-
ary, as well as the assaults of a 91-year-old 
man in Oakland’s Chinatown and an 89-year- 
old woman in Brooklyn. Those episodes, and 
other[s] . . . have terrified the Asian commu-
nity. 
The article continues: 
But there is no ambiguity about the cases 
The Times collected: These are assaults in 
which the assailants expressed explicit racial 
hostility with their language, and in which 
nearly half included a reference to the 
coronavirus. 
This article pointed out some sober-
ing statistics when it comes to hate 
crimes. Over the last year, hate crimes 
as classified and reported by the police 
rose at a faster pace against people of 
Asian descent than hate crimes overall. 
In New York City and Boston, hate 
crimes overall fell while anti-Asian 
hate crimes spiked. 
In New York City alone, the number 
of hate crimes with Asian-American 
victims reported to the New York Po-
lice Department jumped to 28 last year, 
up from 3 in 2019, and so far this year, 
the 
Department 
is 
actively 
inves-
tigating or has solved 35 anti-Asian 
bias crimes. 
Congresswoman GRACE MENG, of New 
York, said: 
We’ve gone from being invisible to being 
seen as subhuman. We just want to be seen 
as American, like everyone else. 
On April 9, 2021, the Washington Post 
ran an article examining the effect of 
mass shootings on marginalized groups 
and how trauma ripples through those 
communities. 
The article stated: 
March 16 marked a turning point for many 
Asian Americans: It was the day their com-
munity was stricken by a mass shooting, be-
coming the latest minority group to suffer 
an attack that killed several of its own . . . 
There’s a specific kind of grief that arises 
from being targeted, one that more and more 
marginalized people in the United States 
know too well. The shooting survivors and 
victims’ family members span geographies, 
races and religions, but they are bonded by 
the shared trauma they have experienced. 
The article continues: 
These tragedies often leave many in those 
communities who weren’t directly affected 
feeling unsafe and traumatized. After a 
shooting, many members of these commu-
nities say they felt hyper-aware of their race 
and an escalated sense of fear that the same 
could happen to them or those they love. A 
mass shooting seems less senseless or inex-
plicable when it’s directed at one of your 
own. 
I recall with sorrow that in 2018 a 
gunman killed 11 Jewish worshipers at 
the Tree of Life in Pittsburgh. 
The article continues: 
Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said his 
synagogue practices the ‘‘ministry of pres-
ence’’. . . . After mass shootings, synagogue 
members reach out to the affected commu-
nities and let them know that they’re 
present, they’re listening. 
The Georgia massacre ‘‘increases the 
fear level now of all Asian Americans 
who prayed, ‘‘Am I next?’’ I know how 
that feels to have your community 
wonder, ‘‘Am I next?’’ said Myers, a 
survivor of the deadliest attack against 
Jews on American soil. 
In recent weeks, flyers have recir-
culated 
at 
Asian-American 
res-
taurants—posted in the synagogue’s 
Squirrel Hill neighborhood after the 
2018 Pittsburgh shooting—to show their 
support for the Jewish community. 
One read: 
Many of our business members have 
thrived in this city, particularly in Squirrel 
Hill, and if we shared in this good fortune, 
then we bear the burdens. 
It was a reminder that Asian Ameri-
cans and Jews share similar status as 
minority communities in the United 
States and now as communities af-
fected by mass shootings. 
I was pleased that, shortly after tak-
ing office, President Biden issued a 
Presidential 
memorandum, 
‘‘Con-
demning and Combating Racism, Xeno-
phobia, and Intolerance Against Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders in the 
United States.’’ 
We need to stop the hate. Referring 
to this global pandemic by anything 
other than its appropriate, medical 
names has inflamed the worst stereo-
types, fear, and xenophobia in the face 
of a health crisis. Irrationally blaming 
Asian or Asian-American neighbors 
and random strangers is simply un- 
American. The Senate and every per-
son in this country needs to call out 
the hate, bullying, and scapegoating 
whenever we see it and work together 
as one community to overcome COVID– 
19. 
In my home State of Maryland, I was 
pleased to see that, last week, Gov-
ernor Larry Hogan announced the for-
mation 
of 
a 
statewide 
workgroup 
charged with developing strategies, 
recommendations, and actions to ad-
dress the rise in violence and discrimi-
nation targeting the Asian-American 
community. 
Governor Hogan named the former 
U.S. attorney for the District of Mary-
land, Robert K. Hur, to chair the 
workgroup and spearhead the effort. 
Mr. Hur was the first Asian American 
to serve as our U.S. attorney in Mary-
land’s history, and I had the pleasure 
of working with him extensively on a 
number of criminal matters and civil 
rights issues during his tenure. 
I also want to commend the work of 
our current acting U.S. attorney in 
Maryland and our FBI Special Agent in 
Charge, Jennifer C. Boone. They put 
out a recent statement which con-
demned bigotry and hatred against the 
Asian-American and Pacific Islander 
community and encouraged members 
of the public to report to law enforce-
ment incidents of violence, threats, 
and harassment. 
Shortly before the shootings in At-
lanta, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
Maryland, on March 10, 2021, launched 
its Civil Rights Unit to ensure that the 
full spectrum of criminal and civil 
statutes are employed in addressing 
hate crimes and discrimination; to con-
duct outreach to government, not-for- 
profit, and private entities in Mary-
land; and to help provide training and 
resources to local and State law en-
forcement in Maryland. 
Today, I rise in support of S. 937, the 
COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, introduced 
by Senator HIRONO of Hawaii. I am 
proud to be a cosponsor of this impor-
tant legislation. I urge the Senate to 
pass this legislation without further 
delay. 
This legislation would direct the U.S. 
Department of Justice to designate a 
DOJ employee to assist with the expe-
dited review of COVID–19 hate crimes 
reported to Federal, State, and/or local 
law enforcement. The legislation would 
provide guidance for State and local 
law enforcement agencies to establish 
the online reporting of hate crimes or 
incidents and to have online reporting 
available in multiple languages; ex-
pand culturally competent and appro-
priate public education and the collec-
tion of data and public reporting of 
hate crimes; and issue guidance detail-
ing best practices to mitigate racially 
discriminatory language in describing 
the COVID–19 pandemic, in coordina-
tion with the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, the COVID–19 Health 
Equity Task Force, and community- 
based organizations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1925 
April 14, 2021 
In the 117th Congress, I was privi-
leged to be named as the chairman of 
the Commission on Security and Co-
operation in Europe, also known as the 
Helsinki Commission. I additionally 
serve as the Special Representative on 
Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intoler-
ance for the OSCE Parliamentary As-
sembly. 
Over the past year, the world has suf-
fered the crippling impact of COVID–19, 
which has disproportionately affected 
our most vulnerable citizens. Racist vi-
olence has, once again, reared its ugly 
head in many OSCE participating 
States, including our own. I pledge to 
continue working with the Helsinki 
Commission and the OSCE to shine a 
spotlight on discrimination, racism, 
and anti-Asian violence both at home 
and abroad as we work together with 
our partners in the United States and 
around the world to share best prac-
tices and combat this scourge against 
our democracy and freedoms we hold so 
dear. 
In 2019, at the annual meeting of the 
OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Lux-
embourg, I chaired a section dealing 
with anti-Semitism. One of the key 
findings that came out of that section 
was that every community needs to 
work together. We are all in this to-
gether. An attack on one community is 
an attack on all of us and the freedom 
of all of us, and we must join in unity 
to speak with a clear, strong voice 
against any of these hate activities. 
We now need an all-hands-on-deck 
approach to combat anti-Asian bias, 
prejudice, discrimination, hate crimes, 
and violence. In working together—all 
communities—with our local, State, 
national, and international partners, 
along with our allies in the private sec-
tor and faith community, we can stem 
this dangerous trend and give a sense 
of peace and security back to our 
Asian-American brothers and sisters. It 
starts with our taking up the legisla-
tion before us and passing it promptly. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we 
are very pleased that the Senate just 
took an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
vote—92 to 6—to move forward with 
legislation to fight the surge of anti- 
Asian violence across our country in 
the wake of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Anti-Asian bigotry and violence is a 
very serious issue that has deep roots 
in our country’s history. Regrettably, 
it has grown far worse over the last 
year. It is something that affects con-
stituents in all of our States and has 
proud Asian-American citizens fearing 
for their safety. I have been told sto-
ries that make me ache: an older Asian 
gentleman afraid to go outside because 
he would be cursed at, berated, even 
spat upon. A young lady told me she 
would no longer take the subway to 
work because the stares at her were so 
angry and intense that it was just 
unnerving. Then it is worse with as-
saults and violence and even a death. 
We need to do something, and I am so 
glad that our Republican colleagues 
have voted with us to proceed with this 
legislation. This was never intended as 
gotcha legislation. It was always in-
tended as bipartisan legislation, and 
for the information of the Senate, we 
are making good progress on reaching 
a bipartisan agreement with sensible, 
germane, 
and 
constructive 
amend-
ments coming from Republican col-
leagues—the Senator from Kansas, the 
Senator from Maine—that, I believe, 
make the bill even stronger. So we 
want to continue with this bipartisan 
process. 
I intend the first amendment to the 
bill to be an amendment offered by 
Senators Moran and Blumenthal. We 
are working with the Republican leader 
to determine if and how many other 
amendments to the bill there will be so 
that we can consider them and vote on 
final passage without any gotcha or 
not germane amendments, but we are 
moving this bill forward because it 
does need to go forward with a sense of 
urgency. 
The legislation will send a loud and 
clear message that racism and violence 
against 
Asian 
Americans 
have 
no 
place—no place—in American society. 
We should endeavor to finish our work 
as quickly as possible and without 
delay. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, the United States is a beacon of 
democracy in the world, and our Na-
tion was founded on free and fair elec-
tions, but if the American people don’t 
have confidence in our elections, we 
don’t have a sustainable democracy. 
What we saw this past election was 
confusion and chaos caused by incon-
sistent 
standards 
and 
last-minute 
changes to established election laws by 
State officials and activist judges. Yet 
it is not just the chaos from this past 
election 
that 
troubles 
Americans 
across the country. For more than a 
decade, growing numbers of Americans 
have become less confident that their 
votes were accurately cast and count-
ed. If we want to continue as a thriving 
democracy, we have to reverse this 
trend and take action so Americans 
trust in free and fair elections. There is 
no other option. 
That is why I have joined my col-
leagues in introducing the Save De-
mocracy Act to restore faith in our 
Federal elections and guarantee that 
voters decide the outcomes of elec-
tions, not the courts, and that is why I 
am here today to ask my colleagues to 
join me in passing one specific section 
of the Save Democracy Act—the Pro-
moting Election Integrity by Proving 
Voter Identity Act—to require voter 
ID. 
It is pretty simple. If you want to 
vote in person, you will need to bring 
your current and valid ID. If you want 
to vote by mail, you will need to pro-
vide a copy of your ID. Like I said, it 
is pretty simple and straightforward. 
We want 100 percent participation in 
our elections and zero percent fraud. 
We want it to be easy to vote and hard 
to cheat. Voter ID helps us to meet 
that goal. 
Of course, the Democrats will do any-
thing to fight against these common-
sense reforms. It is absurd. You have to 
have ID to drive a car, board a plane, 
open a bank account, and pick up a 
prescription. Do they object to that? Of 
course not. These are much needed, 
commonsense reforms to our election 
systems. 
Just look at what is happening in 
Georgia. Two recent news articles show 
that President Biden and the Demo-
crats spread lies to pressure companies 
to boycott Georgia over commonsense 
voting laws even though the Wash-
ington Post gave President Biden four 
Pinocchios for his lies about the Geor-
gia law. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD the two articles 
I have with me today which outline 
how much the Democrats have been 
grossly misleading the public. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

BIDEN FALSELY CLAIMS THE NEW GEORGIA 
LAW ‘ENDS VOTING HOURS EARLY’ 
(By Glenn Kessler) 
‘‘What I’m worried about is how un-Amer-
ican this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s 
sick . . . deciding that you’re going to end 
voting at five o’clock when working people 
are just getting off work.’’—President Biden, 
in remarks at a news conference, March 25 
‘‘Among the outrageous parts of this new 
state law, it ends voting hours early so work-
ing people can’t cast their vote after their 
shift is over.’’—Biden, in a statement ‘‘on 
the attack on the right to vote in Georgia,’’ 
March 26 
During his first news conference, President 
Biden became especially passionate when 
discussing a law being pressed by Republican 
lawmakers in Georgia that he said was in-
tended to make it harder for people to vote. 
He reiterated those concerns the next day in 
a written statement after Gov. Brian Kemp 
(R) signed the bill into law. 
The law has come under fire for restricting 
the distribution of food and water to people 
standing in line, making it harder to cast ab-
sentee ballots, reducing drop boxes for mail 
ballots, barring mobile voting places and for 
making significant procedural changes that 
potentially give more power to the GOP-con-
trolled legislature in the election process. 
Biden has echoed many of those concerns. 
But there was one line in both his news con-
ference and his statement that has kept us 
puzzling until our puzzler was sore. It also 
puzzled experts who have studied the new 
law. 
Let’s take a look. 
THE FACTS 
On Election Day in Georgia, polling places 
are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and if you are

April 14, 2021 
in line by 7 p.m., you are allowed to cast 
your ballot. Nothing in the new law changes 
those rules. 
However, the law did make some changes 
to early voting. But experts say the net ef-
fect of the new early-voting rules was to ex-
pand the opportunities to vote for most 
Georgians, not limit them. 
‘‘You can criticize the bill for many things, 
but I don’t think you can criticize it for re-
ducing the hours you can vote,’’ said Univer-
sity of Georgia political scientist Charles S. 
Bullock III. He speculated that Biden may 
have been briefed on an early version of the 
bill—‘‘there 
were 
25 
versions 
floating 
around’’—and he did not get an update on 
the final version. 
For instance, at one point lawmakers con-
sidered nixing all early voting on Sundays, 
thus eliminating ‘‘souls to the polls,’’ a get- 
out-the-vote initiative popular with pre-
dominantly Black churches. But that idea 
was scrapped in the end. 
‘‘One of the biggest changes in the bill 
would expand early voting access for most 
counties, adding an additional mandatory 
Saturday and formally codifying Sunday 
voting hours as optional,’’ Stephen Fowler of 
Georgia Public Broadcasting said in an ex-
cellent and comprehensive report on the im-
pact of the new law. ‘‘Counties can have 
early voting open as long as 7 a.m. to7 p.m., 
or 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at minimum. If you live 
in a larger metropolitan county, you might 
not notice a change. For most other coun-
ties, you will have an extra weekend day, 
and your weekday early voting hours will 
likely be longer.’’ 
Charles Stewart III, an election expert at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
said: ‘‘I had also heard this generally re-
ported as expanding early voting, so I’m sur-
prised by the characterization.’’ He studied 
the precise language changes at our request 
and said it indicated an expansion of hours, 
especially in rural counties. 
So where would Biden get this perception 
that ordinary workers were getting the shaft 
because the state would ‘‘end voting at five 
o’clock’’? We have one clue. 
The law used to say early ‘‘voting shall be 
conducted during normal business hours.’’ 
Experts said that generally means 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m. The new law makes it specific—‘‘be-
ginning at 9:00 AM and ending at 5:00 PM.’’ A 
Georgia election official said the change was 
made in part because some rural county elec-
tion offices only worked part time during the 
week, not a full eight-hour day, so the shift 
to more specific times makes it clear they 
must be open every weekday for at least 
eight hours. 
But, as noted, the law also allows indi-
vidual counties to set the hours anywhere 
between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. So the practical ef-
fect of the 5 p.m. reference in the law is 
minimal. 
During the 2020 election, for instance, vote- 
rich Fulton County, with a substantial Black 
population, set early-voting hours at 8:30 
a.m. to 6 p.m. on most weekdays and two 
Saturdays, though the last weekdays had 7 
a.m. to 7 p.m. voting hours. Voting was al-
lowed on two Sundays between 12 p.m. and 6 
p.m. 
Under the new law, Fulton County could 
set the exact same hours for in-person early 
voting—or expand them from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
every day. 
Bullock noted that one change in the law 
may impact early voting in runoff elections. 
The law reduced the period between the ini-
tial election and the runoff election, from 
nine to four weeks, potentially shortening 
the period for early voting. 
We were curious what the early-voting 
rules were in Delaware, Biden’s home state. 
It turns out Delaware did not allow any in- 
person early voting in 2020. A law signed in 
2019 will permit early voting starting in 2022. 
(Voting hours are 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Elec-
tion Day.) 
We sought an explanation from the White 
House for the reason for Biden’s remarks but 
did not receive an on-the-record response. 
THE PINOCCHIO TEST 
Biden framed his complaint in terms of a 
slap at working people. The law would ‘‘end 
voting at five o’clock when working people 
are just getting off work’’ or ‘‘ends voting 
hours early so working people can’t cast 
their vote after their shift is over.’’ 
Many listeners might assume he was talk-
ing about voting on Election Day, not early 
voting. But Election Day hours were not 
changed. 
As for early voting, the law made a modest 
change, replacing a vague ‘‘normal business 
hours’’—presumed to be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.—to 
a more specific 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. time period. 
But that’s the minimum. Under the new law, 
counties have the option to extend the vot-
ing hours so voters can start casting ballots 
as early as 7 a.m. and as late as 7 p.m.—the 
same as Election Day in Georgia. Moreover, 
an additional mandatory day of early voting 
on Saturday was added and two days of early 
voting on Sunday were codified as an option 
for counties. 
One could understand a flub in a news con-
ference. But then this same claim popped up 
in an official presidential statement. Not a 
single expert we consulted who has studied 
the law understood why Biden made this 
claim, as this was the section of law that ex-
panded early voting for many Georgians. 
Somehow Biden managed to turn that ex-
pansion into a restriction aimed at working 
people, calling it ‘‘among the outrageous 
parts’’ of the law. There’s no evidence that is 
the 
case.

WARNOCK ADMITS
TO SIGNING EMAIL WITH 
FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT GEORGIA VOTING 
LAW 
(By David Rutz) 
Sen. Raphael Warnock, D–Ga., admitted to 
signing off on false information in a third- 
party advocacy group’s email that went out 
about the Georgia voting law after it passed. 
The Washington Post flagged an email 
Warnock signed from the liberal nonprofit 
3.14 Action as an example of Democratic mis-
information about the sweeping Georgia vot-
ing reforms, as it claimed the new law re-
stricted weekend early voting and ended no- 
excuse mail voting. 
‘‘Sen. Raphael G. Warnock, one of two new 
Democratic senators representing Georgia, 
signed an email sent out by the advocacy 
group 3.14 Action after the law passed, which 
claimed it ended no-excuse mail voting and 
restricted early voting on the weekends— 
also early proposals that did not become 
law,’’ the Post reported. 
Those ideas were considered but did not 
make it into the final bill, which actually 
expands early voting in Georgia to 17 days, 
including two Saturdays. It also still allows 
no-excuse absentee voting, albeit with a 
shorter window of 67 days to apply. 
The statement went out on March 30, five 
days after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Re-
publican, signed the final bill into law. 
A Warnock campaign spokesperson told 
Fox News it approved the text of the group’s 
email before Kemp signed the bill, while the 
provisions were still under consideration. 
The spokesperson noted the Georgia Senate 
passed a bill to end no-excuse absentee vot-
ing earlier in March, and the Georgia House 
originally 
proposed 
restricting 
weekend 
early voting. 
However, neither provision made it into 
the final bill, as the 3.14 Action statement 
Warnock signed appeared to claim. 
The law has been the subject of fierce con-
troversy, with President Biden and other 
Democrats likening it to racist ‘‘Jim Crow’’- 
era restrictions. Kemp and other state Re-
publicans have pushed back on the criticism 
and said the reforms strengthen voting in-
tegrity. 
Biden has also disseminated false informa-
tion about the law, getting Four Pinocchios 
from The Washington Post’s Fact-Checker 
for claiming the law limits voting hours. 
The firestorm around the law has already 
economically hurt Georgia. Bowing to lib-
eral pressure and outrage from Georgia- 
based corporations like Delta and Coca-Cola, 
Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob 
Manfred pulled the 2021 All-Star Game out of 
Atlanta’s Truist Park, costing the area up to 
an estimated $100 million in potential rev-
enue. 
Warnock said he was disappointed by 
MLB’s decision but framed it as the fault of 
Republicans, calling it an ‘‘unfortunate’’ 
consequence of the voting bill. 
‘‘It is my hope that businesses, athletes, 
and entertainers can protest this law not by 
leaving Georgia but by coming here and 
fighting voter suppression head on, and 
hand-in-hand with the community,’’ he said 
in a statement. 
The new Georgia lawmaker is a staunch 
supporter of the For The People Act, a 
sweeping national voting bill which Repub-
licans have slammed as a massive federal 
overreach and Democratic power grab. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. It just goes to 
show you how out of touch the Demo-
crats really are. 
All my Republican colleagues and I 
want to see is more Americans vote, 
and I am thankful Senators BARRASSO 
and CRAMER are joining me in this ef-
fort today. We want a vibrant democ-
racy in which citizens are engaged and 
participating in government at every 
level. 
Sadly, the Democrats are refusing to 
work with us to protect our voting sys-
tems. Instead, the Democrats want to 
make it easier to cheat and harder to 
stop election fraud. That is why the 
Democrats are pushing H.R. 1, which 
would perpetuate distrust in our elec-
tions, impose anti-democratic man-
dates, and further erode our country’s 
institutions. H.R. 1 is the most radical 
piece of voting legislation this Nation 
has ever seen at a time when restoring 
confidence in elections has never been 
more important. 
H.R. 1 removes the most basic safe-
guards against election fraud. The 
Democrat solution to election security 
is the same as their solution to all 
problems: a completely inept, big-gov-
ernment approach that fails at every 
level. 
Before continuing, I would like to 
yield to my colleague from Wyoming 
and thank him for his leadership on 
this effort. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to join my colleague from Flor-
ida, former Governor and now U.S. 
Senator, and talk about the Save De-
mocracy Act and the issues that are 
facing our Nation today, and I want to

S1927 
April 14, 2021 
do that because over the past several 
weeks, Democrats, the media, their 
corporate allies have been misleading 
the American people about our voting 
laws. 
Democrats have been pushing a false 
narrative all around the country, try-
ing to scare Americans into pushing 
and pressuring Congress into passing a 
Federal election takeover. 
Federal election laws and State elec-
tion laws, as guided by our Constitu-
tion, say that it is States that should 
be making the decisions about how we 
run our elections at home. But what 
you see coming out of the Democrats 
in their H.R. 1—that is called S. 1—is a 
law that changes things dramatically 
and takes decisions out of the folks at 
home in Wyoming and puts them in the 
hands of folks in Washington, DC. Peo-
ple in Wyoming, as I talked to them 
the last 2 weeks, don’t want anything 
to do with that. 
Now, Democrats have this listed as 
their No. 1 priority bill for the year; 
otherwise, why would they have listed 
it as No. 1? Not coronavirus, not pan-
demic, not infrastructure—no, taking 
elections away from the States, put-
ting them in the hands of Washington. 
The bill is over 800 pages long. Vir-
tually every page would, I believe, 
make it easier to cheat. That is not 
what the American people want. They 
want to make it easier to vote and 
harder to cheat. 
The bill, H.R. 1, now S. 1, expands 
ballot harvesting, which is where paid 
political operatives, unsupervised, can 
go door to door, nursing home bed to 
nursing home bed, picking up people’s 
ballots and deciding which ballots to 
turn in and which ballots to destroy. 
The bill would register people auto-
matically when they sign up for Med-
icaid or assistance in other forms from 
the government. It would force tax-
payers to fund political campaigns and 
political operatives. Paying for cam-
paign ads, your tax dollars would go for 
that and things that—a candidacy you 
are not for, and you would be paying 
for their ads and their computer time 
and their web pages and their yard 
signs. People in Wyoming don’t want 
that. 
When I describe each one of these to 
the people of Wyoming, they say: Don’t 
let that happen to America. 
I think many Democrats haven’t read 
the 800 pages, and I know if the Amer-
ican people read the 800 pages, they 
would be just as upset as the people in 
Wyoming who have heard what is in 
the bill. 
The American people want security 
in elections. We want integrity, ac-
countability, transparency in how it 
all works, and that is why I am so 
proud to be here and supporting Sen-
ator SCOTT
and cosponsoring, along 
with Senator HYDE-SMITH and Senator 
LUMMIS, a bill that gives confidence to 
people in elections, because our bill— 
overall bill bans voter harvesting. It 
says no to automatic registration. It 
requires at least a Social Security 
number to register to vote. Under our 
bill, you could still vote by mail, as 
people have done year after year in Wy-
oming—done it very successfully. You 
just need to request a ballot, say your 
information is up-to-date, and then you 
get the ballot in the mail—basic com-
monsense measures to protect against 
fraud and against error. 
So the differences between what we 
propose and what the Democrats pro-
pose could not be more clear. I believe 
the Democrat bill makes it easier to 
commit fraud; the Republican bill 
makes it harder to commit fraud. 
If the Democrat bill were good, they 
wouldn’t need to use scare tactics, 
which they have been using all across 
the country, and wouldn’t need to 
spread false information. 
So the people of Wyoming tell me 
they want elections to be fair. They 
want them to be free from voter fraud. 
They want it to be easier to vote, as I 
said, harder to cheat, and just basically 
using an identification card or a means 
to identify yourself when you go to 
vote would make common sense. That 
is what we do in Wyoming, and it 
should be continued to be allowed so 
when someone shows up to vote, they 
can just confirm that they are who 
they say they are. 
And that is why I am proud to stand 
here today with Senator SCOTT
and 
support him on the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, we can and must pass common-
sense reforms to restore confidence in 
our elections. 
The easiest thing we can do right 
now is require voter ID. Americans 
agree this is a necessary step. 
If we are serious about working to-
gether to move our country forward, 
restore public trust, and protect the 
democracy our Nation cherishes, we 
need to pass my bill today, and I look 
forward to all my colleagues joining 
me to protect our democracy. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of S. 1130, in-
troduced earlier today. I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
my colleagues have talked about free 
and fair elections, but I am quite con-
cerned that this bill does quite the op-
posite. 
I am really quite stunned that one 
would think that a bill that dictates 
exactly how every State has to use an 
ID law affects the access to the ballot 
box for every single American, that it 
would be requested that it would be 
passed with no process, no possibility 
of a committee to examine the fact 
that every single American voter is im-
pacted by this effort to erect a barri-
cade between the voter and the ballot 
box. 
I was thinking about how, when we 
were here on January 6, the boxes that 
had the electoral college votes—gor-
geous, ornate, old wooden boxes were 
here on the counter, and they are just 
a symbol of the pulsating heart of our 
Republic, the ability of every citizen to 
participate in the vision for their coun-
try, how their country will operate, 
how their children will have an oppor-
tunity to thrive—that ballot box. 
So here is a bill designed to make it 
harder to get your voice heard, harder 
to get your ballot counted, being asked 
to be considered by this Chamber with 
absolutely no process of committee de-
liberation. 
If we had such a process, it would be 
pointed out that currently millions of 
Americans don’t have the IDs required 
in this measure. Well, that makes it a 
lot harder for millions of Americans to 
vote. 
It would also be pointed out in the 
committee process that of those who 
don’t have those IDs, about three times 
as many Black Americans don’t have 
those IDs as White Americans, even 
though Black Americans are a much 
smaller percentage of the American 
population, which means that this 
measure 
is 
hugely 
discriminatory 
against Black Americans. And it is just 
wrong to engage in that type of dis-
crimination in an effort to manipulate 
the outcome of elections. 
Now, it would be quite a different 
conversation if we had evidence that 
there were an actual, real problem 
being addressed. But, fortunately, this 
has been studied time and time and 
time again. We had the Governor of 
Michigan testifying here on Capitol 
Hill just a few days ago, and we asked 
when they did the study—the inves-
tigation because of the lawsuits that 
were filed related to the last election— 
how many people voted illegally in 
vote by mail. And that effort to find 
the evidence of fraud turned out, she 
said, zero. Zero. 
And I asked her a question because I 
was stunned that it was zero. Certainly 
one person who thought they were a 
citizen but wasn’t a citizen and voted 
who was found? Zero. Zero. 
And there is study after study after 
study. So we understand what this is, 
and that is what would be explored in 
committee. It is an effort to make it 
harder for Americans to vote. 
It is not about security because there 
is not a security problem. It is about 
the fact that this disproportionately 
affects 
low-income 
Americans 
and 
Black Americans. 
So I stand here today considering 
whether to object because I believe in 
that vision of Americans having a full, 
free, fair chance to be involved in their 
elections, defending the ballot box for 
every single American, and this bill 
does the opposite. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard.

S1928 
April 14, 2021 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, my goal is 100 percent participa-
tion and zero percent fraud. It is not 
voter suppression or racist to prove 
your identity for in-person voting. It is 
not voter suppression or racist to prove 
your identity for mail-in voting. It is 
not voter suppression or racist to re-
quire ballot boxes to be monitored. It 
is not voter suppression or racist to 
make sure your vote is in on time. 
My colleague wants to call any at-
tempt to fight fraud in our elections 
voter suppression. My colleague wants 
to call any attempt to fight fraud in 
elections racist. That is just not accu-
rate. 
Voter ID should not be controversial. 
You need an ID to get on a plane, open 
a bank account, drive a car—even an 
ID to get into the White House. But we 
shouldn’t have an ID to vote for the 
President? It just doesn’t make sense. 
Americans believe in voter ID. It is a 
logical step to make our elections 
more secure, and it is a simple change 
we can pass today. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
first, I want to say I want to thank the 
Senator from Oregon for objecting to 
the previous motion, and I share his 
concerns. 
I rise today to speak about some big 
choices our Nation has to make. Will 
we continue to limp along with an 
economy that works for only a few 
wealthy people or will we invest in 
making things in America and in our 
infrastructure and, most importantly, 
in our people? 
Will we continue to allow other coun-
tries to outpace us on technology while 
remaining dependent on critical parts 
made on the other side of the globe or 
will we seize a future that is made in 
America? 
And will we continue to ignore the 
climate crisis and leave it for the next 
generation to deal with and leave an 
even bigger catastrophe or will we take 
action right now—right now—to put 
our Nation on a path to a future of 
good-paying jobs fueled by clean en-
ergy? 
I have often said that in Michigan we 
don’t have an economy unless someone 
makes something and somebody grows 
something. That is what we do in 
Michigan. We make things and grow 
things. And I know that my friend, the 
Presiding Officer from Minnesota, feels 
the 
same—making 
things, 
growing 
things. That is how we have an econ-
omy. It has been the secret to our suc-
cess in Michigan and in so many other 
places around the country. We need to 
make things, and we need to grow 
things. 
Unfortunately, while we have been 
talking about making things for a long 
time, the rest of the world has actually 
been acting. 
It is estimated that the Chinese Gov-
ernment has invested at least $100 bil-
lion to support its electric vehicle in-
dustry. That might be why they have 
hundreds of companies making electric 
vehicles. 
You can’t build a competitive auto 
industry without electric vehicles, and 
you can’t build electric vehicles with-
out a whole lot of batteries and a whole 
lot of other component parts. They 
could all be made here, but most of 
them aren’t. 
Right now, none of the major electric 
vehicle battery providers are American 
companies. They could be if we helped 
partner with them to make that hap-
pen. 
And we have seen what happens when 
our automakers depend on semiconduc-
tors made overseas. Over the past few 
months, a shortage of computer chips 
no bigger than a Kellogg’s cornflake 
have idled multiple plants and led to 
layoffs in Michigan and across the 
country. 
In fact, the Alliance for Auto Innova-
tion estimates that U.S. automakers 
will produce a million fewer cars this 
year because of this shortage of this 
little chip. 
It is not enough to say we need to 
build things in America. We all know 
that. But we can’t build things here 
without first investing in our capacity 
and having a national strategy to build 
things here in America. Thankfully, we 
have a President of the United States 
who understands that. He understands 
the moment we are in and is ready to 
meet the moment. 
Now it is time for Congress to step 
up. Senate Democrats are excited and 
ready to take action, working with the 
President of the United States and 
hopefully working with our colleagues 
across the aisle, in this moment for 
America and America’s future. 
It is important to note that it won’t 
be the first time that actions we have 
taken here have had lasting con-
sequences. More than 100 years ago, 
Henry 
Ford 
and 
Thomas 
Edison 
partnered to build an affordable elec-
tric car. That was the first kind of car 
they wanted to make—an electric car. 
They even built several prototypes in 
Dearborn, MI. The challenge, Ford told 
the New York Times in 1914, was ‘‘to 
build a storage battery of light weight 
which would operate for long distances 
without recharging.’’ Sound familiar? 
That is a challenge most of our auto-
makers are very familiar with. 
Interestingly, around the same time, 
in 1916, Congress passed a change to the 
tax laws that in effect provided oil and 
gas companies interest-free loans. It 
was America’s first fossil fuel subsidy. 
Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that 
given the various issues and struggles 
and costs, Ford chose to focus on an in-
ternal combustion engine. 
Just thinking about it, more than 100 
years later, we are still lighting pre-
historic plants and animals on fire to 
get to the grocery store and to get to 
work. 
Now, it is true that my home State of 
Michigan benefited from these choices. 
We put the world on wheels. We are ex-
tremely proud of our place in history 
and extremely proud of the wonderful 
workers, the skill and ability of our 
workers. But I also understand that we 
would have been better off today if the 
issues of carbon pollution had been ad-
dressed at the very beginning. 
The good news is that we have the 
opportunity now to fulfill Ford and 
Edison’s electric vision. Just last week, 
I toured GM’s new Factory ZERO, 
which soon will be building electric 
Hummers and electric Chevy Silverado 
trucks. These are big vehicles, and 
they are going to be all electric. It is 
very exciting. Stellantis has plans to 
build four new electric hybrid Jeeps in 
Detroit, and Henry Ford’s company is 
investing more than $22 billion to in-
troduce electric versions of its vehi-
cles, including Mustangs, Ford F–150 
trucks, and commercial vans—all very 
exciting. 
These changes are what we need 
right now, but our car companies can’t 
do it without a partnership with us, 
with the Federal Government. Just as 
companies around the world have not 
had to do it alone, we need to make 
sure we are partnering with them to 
actualize this vision for the future. 
You know, the oil companies like to 
say—whenever we talk about various 
incentives for wind or solar or electric 
vehicles or batteries, they always like 
to say: We shouldn’t be picking win-
ners and losers in our country. But I 
would argue that in 1916, with the first 
fossil fuel subsidy, our country picked 
a winner, and they have been sub-
sidized over and over again and win-
ning the energy race ever since. In fact, 
that subsidy is to the tune of at least 
$20 billion every year. Even in the tax 
cuts in 2017, the Republican tax cuts 
for the wealthiest and most well-con-
nected people in the country, there was 
even another new foreign oil tax break 
in there. 
I would argue it is time to give equal 
opportunity to competing technology 
and level the playing field. At the same 
time, we can create good-paying jobs 
here at home, revitalize American 
manufacturing, and put America in the 
driver’s seat of the clean energy future. 
That, we can do—that is so exciting to 
do—if we work with our President to 
get this done. 
If we are going to build back better, 
it is time to start building. The first 
thing we can do is to pass the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan, which invests in Amer-
ican manufacturing, creates an Amer-
ican supply chain for products and 
technologies, and strengthens ‘‘Buy 
American’’ laws. This plan has been 
long overdue, I can tell you, and it is 
just the start of what we need to do. 
My bipartisan American Jobs in En-
ergy Manufacturing Act, which I intro-
duced with Senator MANCHIN and Sen-
ator DAINES, would provide incentives 
for manufacturers to build and retool 
existing plants to make advanced en-
ergy parts like semiconductors and 
batteries and retool for electric vehicle

facilities. It builds on the successful 
48C advanced energy manufacturing 
tax credit, which I authored in 2009. 
That helped boost U.S. manufacturing 
and create good-paying jobs then, and 
we can do it now. 
On the Finance Committee, we are 
also working on legislation that would 
provide an investment tax credit for 
building American battery, semicon-
ductor, and solar cell plants and a cor-
responding tax credit for producing 
these key components. 
I am so pleased that President 
Biden’s American Jobs Plan includes 
electric charging stations as part of 
our infrastructure investment—it cer-
tainly is part of our infrastructure for 
the future, for today and tomorrow— 
and consumer incentives to purchase 
electric vehicles. 
We also need to make sure that 
American taxpayer dollars are spent on 
American products. You know, that 
sounds simple, but that is actually not 
what is being done in every case right 
now, even though we have had laws on 
the books for decades and decades and 
decades. 
My bipartisan Make It in America 
Act with Senator BRAUN
makes it 
harder for Federal Agencies to use 
waivers to get around ‘‘Buy American’’ 
rules to purchase foreign-made prod-
ucts. Right now, there has not been 
enough accountability and structure to 
make sure that waivers are not being 
given so that purchases can be made of 
foreign cars. That needs to stop. 
I also want to thank Senator TAMMY 
BALDWIN for her leadership on these 
‘‘Buy American’’ issues as well. 
The Federal Government is an enor-
mous consumer, and we are set to 
make big infrastructure investments. 
‘‘Buy American’’ rules means that 
American dollars flow into local econo-
mies when we purchase American-made 
PPE and American-made iron and steel 
and great American-made electric ve-
hicles. These rules also create good 
jobs, and we will need highly trained 
workers to fill them. By investing in 
our workforce, which is an important 
part of this plan, we will help the 18 
million Americans currently on unem-
ployment find new opportunities—and 
others as well—new opportunities for 
good jobs and will ensure that our 
young people are on a path for good- 
paying jobs, including skilled trades, 
after high school. 
I am laser-focused on supporting our 
community colleges and uplifting and 
expanding 
registered 
apprenticeship 
programs because these institutions 
and programs help build our middle 
class and ensure working people have 
the skills they need to thrive, not just 
survive. These are great-paying jobs, 
professional 
jobs, 
licensed, 
highly 
skilled jobs, and we need to be encour-
aging more and more young people to 
be able to choose these jobs. 
Henry Ford once said this, one of my 
favorite quotes: 
What’s right about America is that, al-
though we have a mess of problems, we have 
great capacity—intellect and resources—to 
do something about them. 
There is no doubt that we face big 
challenges, but Henry Ford was right: 
We do have great capacity, intellect, 
and resources to do something about 
them. Now is the time to do that, to 
act. People in Michigan have been 
waiting long enough, waiting way too 
long, and people across the country 
have waited far too long for us to act 
on what we know we can do to make 
things in America, to remake things in 
America, to build back better. We can 
make this an American moment, or we 
can sit back and wait for the future to 
happen to us. 
This is the moment to invest in our 
workers who build our country’s infra-
structure, including those things we 
need today that they didn’t need 100 
years ago, like high-speed internet and 
electric charging stations, and the 
things that we will need to make us 
successful and global leaders moving 
forward. 
We need to rebuild our supply chains 
in America so we are not being held up 
because of a really important part that 
is made only in one country halfway 
around the world. That is absurd. We 
can do that. We can do that. We can do 
that by deciding we are going to invest 
in America. And we need to use the 
power of American ingenuity to ensure 
a livable and prosperous future for ev-
eryone. 
This is the moment to act. I am ex-
cited about that. I know that we have 
this moment right now to be able to 
jump-start the future, to be able to 
build our economy back better, to 
make things in America, and I hope we 
will seize this moment. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Iowa. 
COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
today I express my concern over the 
rise in violent crime and in particular 
the hate crimes against Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders. 
Every single one of us ought to be 
horrified to see our fellow Americans 
attacked because of their race or eth-
nicity. We are united in our opposition 
to this hateful violence. We are united 
in seeing it investigated and pros-
ecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
I introduced a resolution to this effect, 
and I will welcome all my Senate col-
leagues to join me. 
I am very happy to see that Attorney 
General Garland has turned his atten-
tion to this problem. On March 30, he 
directed the Department of Justice to 
engage in a 30-day review of the De-
partment’s response to hate crimes. I 
hope the Senate will benefit from the 
results of that review. However, our re-
sponses to the problem of hate crimes 
must be guided by the facts and a pur-
suit of sound policy. I am not sure that 
we have done the legwork to arrive at 
a legislative solution that will make a 
difference to preventing, deterring, and 
punishing these crimes. 
Along with my colleague Senator 
COTTON, the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and 
Counterterrorism, we are requesting a 
full or subcommittee hearing on the 
issue, and we should do that after the 
Attorney General’s review has been 
completed. 
We now have before the Senate S. 937, 
the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, being 
introduced before the Attorney Gen-
eral’s review began and appears to be 
duplicative or even in conflict with 
some of the DOJ’s existing efforts. This 
does not seem to me to be the best 
path, but that is the path the Senate is 
on now, and I voted to proceed hours 
ago to S. 937. I am thankful that it is 
coming up. I know that Members of the 
Republican caucus have amendments 
that will hopefully improve the bill and 
make 
it 
a 
very 
useful 
piece 
of 
legislation. 
We hope these amendments will be 
listened to and fairly considered by our 
Democratic colleagues. This is too im-
portant of an issue to get wrong. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Madam President, now, on another 
point. Between Democrats who believe 
Russia rigged the vote to elect Trump 
in 2016 and Republicans who believe 
various theories questioning Biden’s 
election victory, they all add up to 
what seems to be a bipartisan super-
majority of Americans casting doubt 
about our elections. In fact, one promi-
nent claim by some Trump supporters 
that a particular brand of voting ma-
chine switched Trump votes to Biden 
appears to have been plagiarized from 
the Democratic Party’s playbook from 
the election of 2004. 
I 
heard 
from 
many 
left-leaning 
Iowans at that time who questioned 
President Bush’s victory based on 
claims that a particular brand of vot-
ing machine switched votes in Ohio. 
That was 2004. It seems kind of similar, 
doesn’t it, today. 
Those totally unsubstantiated claims 
ultimately led Democrats to force a 
vote in a joint session of Congress in 
2005 to reject Ohio’s electoral votes 
cast for President Bush. There are still 
Democratic Members of Congress in 
both Chambers who voted to overturn 
Ohio State’s certified election in 2004. 
Now, after the 2018 gubernatorial 
election in Georgia, the losing Demo-
cratic candidate refused to concede, 
claiming, without evidence that would 
stand up in court, that she, as a Demo-
cratic candidate for Governor of Geor-
gia, would have won but for voting 
irregularities. Now, rather than dis-
tance itself from questioning a cer-
tified election in 2018, the Democratic 
Party invited her to speak at their con-
vention in 2020. 
Two years later, the tables are now 
turned. Trump lost Georgia by a far 
smaller margin than that Democratic 
candidate for Governor in Georgia in 
2018 did, but we are now told that to 
suggest that there were flaws in the 
2020 Georgia election is somehow unac-
ceptable and undermining democracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1930 
April 14, 2021 
It is pretty obvious, after this his-
tory, that we need to break the cycle of 
partisans questioning elections when 
their side lost or it is OK to complain 
when their side lost, but if the other 
side does the same thing, there is 
something wrong with it. So there is a 
lesson for both Republicans and Demo-
crats. Both parties must stop finger- 
pointing, stop blaming, and stop the 
partisan accusations. We all need to 
work together to restore Americans’ 
faith in elections. 
So that brings me to something very 
current because it passed the House of 
Representatives. So that brings me to 
the Democrats’ so-called For the Peo-
ple Act. Incidentally, don’t you find 
that name a little creepy? So often in 
history, when people claim to speak for 
‘‘the people,’’ they were just seeking 
power. 
For the People Act was introduced 
after the 2018 elections as a clear polit-
ical 
statement 
to 
build 
the 
hyperpartisan narrative that Demo-
cratic defeats were due to widespread 
voter suppression. 
Now, we always hear about voter sup-
pression before and since the 2020 elec-
tion, but just think of the historic 
turnout—not only the historic turnout 
that the losing candidate had but the 
historic turnout that the winning can-
didate had. And yet we have voter sup-
pression. 
H.R. 1 was then, and remains, a hast-
ily cobbled together collection of every 
Democratic proposal for new election 
mandates. No care was taken to make 
it cohesive or workable. It is evident 
that State and local election officials 
were not consulted in its drafting. 
You know, just to consider the size of 
the bill, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
I think, was only two pages. For the 
People Act, the bill introduced—or 
heard—before the Senate Rules Com-
mittee is 800 pages. 
Now, that bill that I just talked 
about had actually passed the House in 
2019 on party lines and was placed di-
rectly on the Senate calendar at Sen-
ator SCHUMER’s request. Now, this is 
very typical of political messaging 
bills so the minority leader can force a 
vote to proceed. I assume, in 2019, that 
Senator SCHUMER
did not force the 
Senate vote to take up the bill because 
partisan activists got more traction 
out of blaming Leader MCCONNELL for 
not bringing it up. Regardless, in 2019, 
it was clearly designed as a messaging 
bill and not one designed to ever get to 
the President’s desk. 
Now, in 2021, we are back at it again, 
considering a totally partisan mes-
saging bill that would radically rework 
all States’ election systems, where it 
has been in the Constitution the pri-
mary concern of the State legislators 
and Congress seldomly intervening. I 
suppose the most obvious is that on a 
certain date in November we all have 
Presidential 
elections 
and 
congres-
sional elections on the same date in all 
50 States, but beyond that, it is pretty 
much up to each State how they want 
to conduct their elections. 
So how does this bill, passing the 
House, once again, over here in the 
Senate—how does that jibe with the 
message from Democrats just a couple 
of months ago that State-run elections 
are beyond reproach? Don’t you re-
member? Because all 50 States had 
State-certified 
elections, 
that 
gave 
Biden his win. 
Now, it is pretty common sense. Ei-
ther State-run elections are fundamen-
tally flawed and unfair, requiring mas-
sive Federal intervention and Ameri-
cans who question the outcome are 
taking a moral stand, or State-run 
elections are, by and large, very fair, 
and Americans can have confidence in 
the outcomes. 
Either 
way, 
the 
same 
principle 
should apply to the last several elec-
tions whether Republicans or Demo-
crats were relatively more successful 
in each case. I get it. I get it that hav-
ing unleashed this partisan tiger—the 
bill that came from the House of Rep-
resentatives—it is very hard to get 
that partisan tiger back in the cage. 
But when this bill fails, as it must, 
we need to tamp down the partisan ac-
cusations and work across party lines 
to restore faith in American elections. 
Now, the way the environment here is 
in Washington and in Congress, it isn’t 
going to be easy, but the alternative is 
unthinkable. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose the 
Democrats’ 
latest 
liberal 
spending 
spree. Just over a month ago, Demo-
crats put $2 trillion onto America’s 
credit card. They said it was for 
coronavirus. That was false adver-
tising, and that is because only $1 out 
of every $11 in the $2 trillion being 
spent was actually going to public 
health. 
The bill turned out to be a big payoff 
to the people who run the Democratic 
Party: the union bosses, the DC bu-
reaucrats, 
and 
the 
bankrupt 
blue 
States. Democrats crammed the bill 
through the Senate with just 50 votes. 
Democrats haven’t even finished their 
victory lap. 
Yet, at this time, they want another 
$2.3 trillion. They have already told us 
they are going to cram it through with 
just 50 votes, once again, and, once 
again, they are using more false adver-
tising. 
President Biden calls this an infra-
structure bill. Well, that is a new defi-
nition of the word ‘‘infrastructure.’’ 
Only about $1 out of every $20 would go 
to roads and bridges. 
Now, here are just a few other items 
that the Democrats call infrastructure: 
$100 billion for so-called workforce de-
velopment and over $300 billion on 
housing 
and 
upgrading 
of 
Federal 
buildings—Federal buildings—the ones 
we work in. It includes $100 billion for 
something 
called 
the 
greening 
of 
schools, which, when you go through 
and see what does that include, it in-
cludes making greener lunches. It in-
cludes eliminating paper products in 
the cafeterias and making the cafeteria 
trays that people use to carry their 
food, makes each one of those into 
trays that can be recycled. 
Call it what you will, this is not in-
frastructure. The largest spending part 
of the bill is $400 billion to expand Med-
icaid. The list goes on and on. That is 
just the tip of the iceberg. 
Now, some of the spending in the 
overall bill may have merit. That 
spending should go through regular 
order, going through committees and 
coming to the floor of the Senate for 
amendments and then votes. 
But it is still not infrastructure. This 
isn’t an infrastructure bill. Even the 
White House Press Secretary admitted 
it. She said this. She said it is partly 
infrastructure—partly infrastructure. 
Now, the bill includes another big 
payoff to the union bosses because it 
forces long-term healthcare facilities 
to unionize if they want to receive the 
funding in the bill. There is Medicaid 
expansion. That would hurt States like 
Wyoming and others that protect and 
believe in the right to work. 
The bill would also hurt Wyoming be-
cause of its attack on American en-
ergy. 
Representative 
ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ has compared the bill 
to the Green New Deal. One Demo-
cratic Senator admitted it. He said it is 
a way of accomplishing many of the 
goals of the Green New Deal. 
Out of all the payoffs in the bill, one 
of the biggest goes to the electric car 
industry. The bill would spend more 
money on electric cars than it does on 
roads, bridges, ports, airports, and wa-
terways 
combined—an 
astonishing 
amount of money. 
President Biden announced the bill in 
one of America’s greatest energy-pro-
ducing regions, which is Western Penn-
sylvania. Yet energy-producing States 
like Pennsylvania and Wyoming have a 
lot to lose from this bill. 
The bill would spend $10 billion on 
something called the Civilian Climate 
Corps. These are taxpayer-funded ac-
tivists who would advance environ-
mental justice. That is what it says: 
$10 billion to Civilian Climate Corps to 
advance environmental justice. 
And then there is another $35 billion 
on climate innovation and $27 billion in 
clean energy and sustainability accel-
erator. It just seems that they are 
throwing 
money 
and 
names 
onto 
things. These are slush funds. They are 
going to give government bureaucrats 
more power to pick winners and losers 
in our economy. 
We all remember the disaster called 
Solyndra. It was a Silicon Valley start-
up. The last time Joe Biden was in the 
White House, his administration, along 
with Barack Obama, gave them $500 
million—taxpayer 
dollars—for 
so- 
called clean energy. We later found out 
that Solyndra lied on their loan appli-
cation form, and, apparently, no one in

the administration caught it. The com-
pany went bankrupt—500 million tax-
payer dollars gone forever. 
President Biden is bringing back this 
kind of central planning. It is all in the 
name, he says, of green energy. If we 
pass this bill, I will tell you that we 
are going to see another Solyndra and 
another one after that and another one 
after that. 
So how are Democrats going to pay 
for this piece of legislation? Well, they 
are going to cram through the largest 
tax increase of the century. They are 
going to use 15 years’ worth of tax in-
creases to pay for 8 years of spending. 
So the spending is temporary, but the 
tax increases will be permanent. 
If the bill becomes law, it will be 
harder for American companies to 
compete with companies in other coun-
tries, and the concern is that means 
more companies are going to move 
overseas because taxes there will be 
lower. When they do, they are going to 
take good American jobs with them. 
You know, with the Republican tax 
cuts that we did in 2017, we saw $1 tril-
lion flow back into this country in just 
2 years. President Biden is ready to 
send all of that money back overseas. 
The official name of the bill is the 
American Jobs Plan. Yet it is not 
much of a jobs bill. The jobs this bill 
would allegedly create would cost 
$800,000 each job. It is a lot to pay for 
a single job when communities all 
across the country have outside of 
their businesses ‘‘Help wanted’’ signs. 
I saw one in Afton, WY, last week. A 
small community in western Wyoming 
there is a convenience store, and the 
sign said: 
Your father called. He said you need a job. 
We’re hiring. 
There are signs like that all over the 
country. Small businesses and small 
business owners I have talked to con-
tinue to say: We cannot find people to 
hire. And yet the administration has a 
jobs plan, they say, where it is going to 
cost taxpayers $800,000 for each job to 
create. At the same time, the bill is 
going to eliminate many good-paying 
energy jobs, and that is a real concern. 
Democrats 
are 
cramming 
this 
through at a time when our economy is 
already recovering. The pandemic is 
coming to an end. The experts say we 
are going to create 11 million more jobs 
over the next 4 years even if we don’t 
pass the bill. And there are jobs avail-
able today. 
One analysis from the Wharton Busi-
ness School said the bill would actually 
slow down the economy. That is be-
cause the bill would discourage busi-
nesses from investing. It is not an in-
frastructure bill, not much of a jobs 
bill. It is a slush fund for more liberal 
spending. That is what is on the minds 
of the Democrats who are pushing this 
bill forward. 
It is not what the United States 
needs right now. We need real infra-
structure improvements. We need a 
real infrastructure bill—one that will 
build road, bridges, our waterways, and 
allow us to do things faster and better 
and cheaper and smarter. If Democrats 
want to do that, Republicans are ready 
to support it. 
Last Congress, I worked with Senator 
TOM CARPER of Delaware on a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill in the Senate 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee. I chaired it in the last Con-
gress. Our bill was so bipartisan that 
Senator BERNIE SANDERS voted for it, 
and so did I. It passed the committee 
unanimously, 21 to 0. When we went to 
work with Democrats in the House on 
the legislation, they ignored it and re-
placed it with the Green New Deal. 
That is what President Biden is doing 
right now as well. He is ignoring the 
bill we passed and trying to sneak the 
Green New Deal into law. 
So I would urge my Democratic col-
leagues to reverse course, to throw out 
this liberal wish list, this slush fund of 
liberal spending, and start over work-
ing in a bipartisan way with Repub-
licans. 
We should start with a bipartisan bill 
that the Senate Committee on EPW 
passed last year. Instead of paying off 
the unions and the climate activists, 
let’s rebuild our roads and our bridges 
and do it in a way that works for all 
Americans. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

REMEMBERING ALVIN SYKES 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the life of a 
gentleman named Alvin Sykes, who 
passed away on March 19, 2021, in Kan-
sas City, MO. 
Teddy Roosevelt once famously said, 
in life, ‘‘The credit belongs to the man 
who is actually in the arena, whose 
face is marred by dust and sweat and 
blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, 
who comes short again and again . . . 
but who does actually strive to do the 
deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, 
[the] great devotions; who spends him-
self in a worthy cause.’’ 
Alvin Sykes was the man in the 
arena. He was a man who knew great 
devotion, who dedicated himself to a 
worthy cause, and who helped move 
our Nation even closer to our founding 
promise of ‘‘liberty and justice for all.’’ 
Alvin was born to a teenage mother. 
He ended his public school enrollment 
after the eighth grade, but he never 
ended his education. In his own words, 
Alvin transferred from public school to 
the public library. 
In the coming decades, Alvin im-
mersed himself in learning about civil 
rights crimes and cold cases, becoming 
an expert on an often overlooked issue. 
He researched the history of these 
tragic crimes, the relevant laws, and 
the statutes of jurisdiction. 
Alvin was so well versed, when he 
testified about such cases before Con-
gress in 2007, one Member mistakenly 
assumed he was an attorney. Alvin re-
plied that he was not an attorney, but 
it was evident the knowledge and in-
sight he possessed on these issues sur-
passed even the best-educated lawyers 
in this town. 
What made Alvin so remarkable, 
however, wasn’t the knowledge he ac-
quired but what he did with it. As he 
learned more about unsolved civil 
rights crimes—the ones no one talked 
about, the ones no one looked into— 
Alvin realized we needed a system in 
place to investigate those cold cases 
and uncover the truth. 
I met Alvin Sykes in 2016 through 
Senator Tom Coburn, a great and dear 
and missed friend today. Dr. Coburn 
ran into Alvin Sykes and heard this 
story and built a relationship that 
wasn’t just personal—it was profes-
sional—because he wanted to help 
Alvin fix these wrongs. 
Through Alvin’s advocacy and guid-
ance, 
I 
joined 
Congressman 
John 
Lewis—a civil rights icon who, sadly, 
also passed away this last year—to in-
troduce the Emmett Till Unsolved 
Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization 
Act. The legislation was named for 14- 
year-old Emmett Till, who was bru-
tally murdered in Mississippi in 1955 
and whose killers were acquitted. 
After we introduced the bill, Alvin 
did what he had been doing for years: 
He went to work. He got in the arena. 
And he did not stop until there was leg-
islation authorizing a Department of 
Justice unit dedicated to investigating 
and prosecuting cold cases that re-
mained unsolved from the civil rights 
era. 
To date, the Justice Department has 
investigated 152 cases under this pro-
gram. And while many others were 
dedicated to making this a reality as 
well, Alvin’s expertise, his passion, and 
his persistence were second to none. 
Last year, Alvin reached out to me 
again, seeking to posthumously recog-
nize Emmett Till and his mother 
Mamie Till-Mobley for their role in 
starting the civil rights movement. His 
advocacy led me to introduce legisla-
tion with Senator BOOKER to award 
Emmett Till and Mamie the Congres-
sional Gold Medal, the Nation’s highest 
civilian honor. I can’t think of two in-
dividuals more worthy of it than them. 
This bill is also a worthy coda for 
Alvin Sykes’ life and his legacy. You 
see, Alvin was born only a year after 
Emmett Till’s mother. And when he 
first became involved in that case, he 
heard Emmett’s mother Mamie say she 
had been fighting to get justice since 
1956. 
Alvin said he thought to himself: I 
was born in 1956. That means she has 
been trying to do one thing my entire 
life. 
Now Alvin is no longer with us, but 
the pursuit of justice for the Till fam-
ily continues. My hope is that Congress 
will soon pass this legislation to recog-
nize and honor their legacy. Today, 
though, I want to give Alvin the credit 
and the honor he deserves. His passion, 
his advocacy, and his high achieve-
ments made our Nation a better place.

VAISAKHI AND THE 400TH BIRTH-
DAY OF GURU TEG BAHADUR 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my Sikh friends, Penn-
sylvania’s Sikh community, and Sikhs 
around the world in recognizing two 
important Sikh celebrations taking 
place 
this 
week: 
(the 
holiday 
of 
Vaisakhi and the 400th anniversary of 
the birth of Guru Teg Bahadur. 
Sikhism traces its origins to the 
Punjab region of India and has flour-
ished around the world for nearly 600 
years. The Sikh tradition is built upon 
ideals of peace, respect, and equality. 
Further, Sikhs are dedicated to the 
principle that every person is created 
equal before God, no matter their race, 
gender, religion, or creed. Today, Sikhs 
number 30 million globally, making 
Sikhism one of the world’s major reli-
gions. Nearly 700,000 Sikhs live in the 
United States, and many of them have 
made Pennsylvania their home. 
Sikhs share a strong sense of commu-
nity, family, and selfless service, as 
evidenced by their commitment to wel-
coming and serving individuals from 
all religious, cultural, and ethnic back-
grounds. During the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Sikh communities across the 
country, including in Pennsylvania, 
mobilized to deliver meals, groceries, 
masks, and other supplies to tens of 
thousands of families in need. In my 
own travels across the Commonwealth, 
I have witnessed firsthand the spirit of 
this community when meeting with 
Sikh constituents. It is clear they have 
enriched their neighborhoods and con-
tributed in numerous ways to the 
growth and vitality of Pennsylvania 
and the United States. 
As a proud member of the American 
Sikh Congressional Caucus, each year, 
I join many voices across Congress and 
the United States in commemorating 
the holiday of Vaisakhi, which took 
place on April 13 this year. Vaisakhi 
marks the spring harvest and serves as 
a day of reflection of Sikhism’s origins. 
During Vaisakhi, Sikhs commemorate 
the founding in 1699 of the Khalsa 
Panth, an order of devout Sikhs who 
played a fundamental role in culti-
vating the religion’s history and iden-
tity. 
Traditionally, 
Sikhs 
recognize 
Vaisakhi with parades, dancing, sing-
ing, and other festivities. Sikhs also 
commemorate this special day with 
community service, both organizing 
and volunteering in various commu-
nity projects. In years past, Sikhs from 
around the country have organized a 
parade here in Washington, DC to com-
memorate Vaisakhi as National Sikh 
Day. While the pandemic has prevented 
such largescale, public celebrations 
both last year and this year, I look for-
ward 
to 
welcoming 
Pennsylvania’s 
Sikh community back to D.C. in the 
years to come. 
In addition to celebrating Vaisakhi, 
Sikhs will also mark the 400th anniver-
sary of the birth of spiritual leader 
Guru Teg Bahadur on April 18. The 
Ninth Guru of Sikhism, Guru Teg 
Bahadur is remembered as a champion 
of religious liberty for all. In 1675, Guru 
Teg Bahadur confronted Moghul Em-
peror Aurangzeb against the forced re-
ligious conversation of Hindus, an act 
for which he was publicly beheaded in 
Delhi. In giving his life to protect a re-
ligion that was not his own, he is fond-
ly remembered by Sikhs as Dhram Di 
Chadar, or Shield of the Religions. 
I extend my best wishes to the Sikh 
community for the joyous celebrations 
of Vaisakhi and the 400th anniversary 
of the birth of Guru Teg Bahadur.

By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. YOUNG): 
S. 1126. A bill to amend the Edu-
cation Sciences Reform Act of 2002 and 
the Educational Technical Assistance 
Act of 2002 to strengthen research in 
adult education; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to introduce the bipartisan 
Strengthening Research in Adult Edu-
cation Act with my colleague, Senator 
YOUNG. We are in urgent need of identi-
fying and disseminating innovative and 
effective methods for supporting adult 
learners. Our legislation will ensure 
that there is a strong research base to 
improve the teaching provided for, and 
the learning of, adults seeking to ad-
vance their literacy, numeracy, and 
digital literacy skills. 
The most recent data from the Pro-
gram for the International Assessment 
of Adult Competencies show an urgent 
need for action in adult education with 
an estimated 19 percent of adults ages 
16–65 in the United States performing 
at the lowest levels of literacy; twenty- 
nine percent at the lowest levels of 
numeracy; and 24 percent at the lowest 
levels of digital problem solving. This 
is a dire situation. These are essential 
skills for postsecondary education and 
the workplace. Beyond their value in 
the labor market, these skills are also 
correlated with health and civic par-
ticipation, making adult education 
critically important to the health and 
well-being of our people, our economy, 
and our democracy. 
In Rhode Island, it is estimated that 
nearly 82,000 working age adults have 
less than a high school education. Over 
55,000 have limited English proficiency. 
Yet, we are reaching just over 5,000 
through the current adult education 
program. Clearly, we need more re-
sources and innovative, research-based 
ways to reach more people. 
The Strengthening Research in Adult 
Education Act will support the key re-
forms to adult education in the Work-
force Innovation and Opportunity Act 
by ensuring that adult education is in-
cluded in our national education re-
search 
priorities. 
Specifically, 
the 
Strengthening Research in Adult Edu-
cation Act will amend the Education 
Sciences Reform Act to require the In-
stitute for Education Sciences and the 
National Center for Education Statis-
tics to collect data and carry out re-
search on: successful State and local 
adult education and literacy activities, 
the 
characteristics 
and 
academic 
achievement of adult learners, and ac-
cess to and opportunity for adult edu-
cation, including digital literacy skills 
development, in communities across 
the Nation. It will also ensure that the 
Institute of Education Sciences draws 
on the expertise of adult educators 
when developing policies and priorities. 
Finally, the legislation would require 
that at least one research center would 
focus on adult education. 
These straightforward amendments 
to the Education Sciences Reform Act 
will go a long way to strengthening the 
research base that will support the im-
provement of adult education across 
the country. I was pleased to work with 
the adult education community, and 
particularly, the Coalition of Adult 
Basic Educators and the National Coa-
lition for Literacy in developing this 
legislation. I urge my colleagues to 
support the Strengthening Research in 
Adult Education Act and to work with 
me to ensure that its provisions are in-
cluded in the reauthorization of the 
Education Sciences Reform Act.

in 1988 to call attention to the terrible work-
ing and living conditions of farm workers in 
the United States; 
Whereas, through his commitment to non-

ers and became an inspiration to and a re-
source for individuals engaged in human 
rights struggles throughout the world;

including a record number of vulnerable, un-
accompanied children unlawfully crossing 
the unsecured United States-Mexico border 
(referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘South-
ern border’’); 
Whereas the Southern border is experi-
encing a humanitarian crisis with unprece-
dented numbers of vulnerable individuals at-
tempting to unlawfully enter the United 
States; 
Whereas, on March 13, 2021, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security directed the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
support a government-wide response effort to 
address the surge of unlawful crossings at 
the Southern border; 
Whereas, in February 2021, 100,441 individ-
uals were apprehended at the Southern bor-
der, which is a 28 percent increase from Jan-
uary 2021; 
Whereas a total of 458,088 individuals were 
encountered at the Southern border in fiscal 
year 2020, which is only 61,130 encounters 
more than the number recorded in the first 
half of the current fiscal year; 
Whereas, in all of fiscal year 2020, 33,239 un-
accompanied minors were encountered at the 
Southern border, which is only 3,510 encoun-
ters more than the number recorded in the 
first half of the current fiscal year; 
Whereas CBP has conducted more than 
3,000 daily apprehensions, while still main-
taining a posture to secure the border of the 
Nation and facilitate international trade and 
travel; 
Whereas the immigration policies of Presi-
dent Biden are— 
(1) luring hundreds of thousands of mi-
grants to unlawfully cross the Southern bor-
der; 
(2) leading to an alarming increase in 
human trafficking and drug smuggling by 
cartels and transnational criminal organiza-
tions; and 
(3) putting unaccompanied minors at risk 
of human trafficking, violence, sexual abuse, 
and separation from the families of the unac-
companied minors; 
Whereas numerous acts of selfless heroism 
by CBP agents occur on a daily basis, as the 
agents face dangerous conditions but con-
tinue to risk their lives during a global 
health pandemic to rescue migrants at-
tempting to unlawfully enter the United 
States along the Southern border; 
Whereas the selfless heroism by CBP 
agents has been on full display as the crisis 
at the Southern border grows and thousands 
of aliens attempt to unlawfully enter the 
United States each day, including recently 
reported rescues— 
(1) in February 2021, of a migrant woman 
from Mexico abandoned by human smugglers 
and left to die in a freezing winter storm as 
they attempted to unlawfully enter Texas; 
(2) in March 2021, of a migrant man and a 
2-year-old child swept away by a swift cur-
rent in a canal as they attempted to unlaw-
fully enter Arizona; 
(3) in March 2021, of a migrant man who 
was abandoned by human smugglers unlaw-
fully entering California, remained missing 
for 8 days, and had to be carried out of the 
mountainous terrain on the shoulders of a 
CBP agent; and 
(4) in March 2021, of a migrant man in se-
vere distress in a remote desert location who 
was abandoned by human smugglers at-
tempting to unlawfully enter New Mexico 
and who required serious medical attention; 
Whereas faced with inadequate Federal re-
sources to manage the surge of illegal border 
crossings, States along the Southern border 
have installed their own border protection 
patrols, such as Arizona Border Strike Force 
and Operation Lone Star in Texas; and 
Whereas resources from Federal, State, 
and local agencies will need to be diverted 
from other areas to handle the surge of mi-
grants 
unlawfully 
entering 
the 
United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that there is an ongoing and 
growing crisis on our Southern border; and 
(2) commends the men and women of the 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, includ-
ing Border Patrol personnel, Office of Field 
Operations personnel, Air and Marine Oper-
ations personnel, Office of Trade personnel, 
the Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy, and all support personnel and allies of 
such agencies from State and local govern-
ments for the work of such men and women 
during the crisis at the Southern border.

him to the bill S. 937, to facilitate the 
expedited review of COVID–19 hate 
crimes, and for other purposes; which 
was ordered to lie on the table; as fol-
lows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. TASK FORCE ON DISCRIMINATION IN 
HIGHER 
EDUCATION 
OF 
ASIAN 
AMERICANS. 
The Attorney General, in coordination 
with the Secretary of Education, shall estab-
lish a task force to investigate, and provide 
proposals for remedies to, discrimination by 
institutions of higher education (as defined 
in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002)) against Asian Ameri-
cans in recruitment, applicant review, and 
admissions. 
SA 1415. Mr. CRUZ submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill S. 937, to facilitate the 
expedited review of COVID–19 hate 
crimes, and for other purposes; which 
was ordered to lie on the table; as fol-
lows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. RESTRICTION ON THE RELEASE OF 
INDIVIDUALS 
WHO 
UNLAWFULLY 
ENTER THE UNITED STATES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) There was a 71 percent increase in the 
number of illegal immigrant encounters by 
U.S Customs and Border Protection agents 
between February and March 2021. 
(2) In March 2021, more than 172,000 illegal 
immigrants were intercepted by U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection agents, includ-
ing 53,000 illegal immigrants who entered the 
United States as part of a family group. 
(3) Although Federal law requires the De-
partment of Homeland Security to detain, 
pending the completion of removal pro-
ceedings, any alien who is not ‘‘clearly and 
beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted’’, as 
of April 2021, the Department of Homeland 
Security is releasing many such individuals 
into communities in Texas and other border 
States, which has caused a significant strain 
on such communities and on State and local 
governments that lack the resources and in-
frastructure to care for so many individuals. 
(b) 
RESTRICTION.—The 
Department 
of 
Homeland Security may not release any in-
dividual who unlawfully entered the United 
States into any State, county, or city in the 
United States unless the governor of such 
State and the governing body of such county 
and city expressly consent to such release. 
(c) CAUSE OF ACTION.—A violation of sub-
section (b) shall give rise to a cause of action 
against the Federal Government by a State, 
county, or city into which jurisdiction such 
individual was released. 
SA 1416. Mr. CRUZ submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill S. 937, to facilitate the 
expedited review of COVID–19 hate 
crimes, and for other purposes; which

lows: 
At the end, add the following: 
SEC. 4. PROHIBITION OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR 
INSTITUTIONS 
OF 
HIGHER 
EDU-
CATION 
THAT 
DISCRIMINATE 
AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, no institution of higher education (as 
defined in section 102 of the Higher Edu-
cation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002)) may re-
ceive any Federal funding if the institution 
has a policy in place or engages in a practice 
that discriminates against Asian Americans 
in recruitment, applicant review, or admis-
sions. 
SA 1417. Mr. CRUZ submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill S. 937, to facilitate the

lows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON RELEASE OF ALIENS 
DETAINED FOR UNLAWFULLY EN-
TERING THE UNITED STATES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Department of Home-
land Security may not release from custody 
any alien who is detained for unlawfully en-
tering the United States unless such alien 
tests negative for COVID–19 during the 24- 
hour 
period 
immediately 
preceding 
the 
alien’s release. 
(b) SAVINGS PROVISION.—Nothing in this 
Act may be construed to authorize the re-
lease any person from the custody of the De-
partment of Homeland Security who is not 
otherwise authorized by law to be released. 
SA 1418. Mr. CORNYN submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill S. 937, to facilitate the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1947 
April 14, 2021 
SA 1431. Ms. ERNST (for herself and 
Mrs. CAPITO) submitted an amendment 
intended to be proposed by her to the 
bill S. 937, to facilitate the expedited 
review of COVID–19 hate crimes, and 
for other purposes; which was ordered 
to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. COVID–19 VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
ACT EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) According to the American Journal of 
Emergency Medicine, during the COVID–19 
pandemic, police departments across the 
country reported increases in domestic vio-
lence. 
(2) One study, published in the journal Ra-
diology, found that at Brigham and Women’s 
Hospital in Boston, radiology scans and su-
perficial wounds consistent with domestic 
abuse from March 11 to May 3 of last year ex-
ceeded the totals for the same period in 2018 
and 2019 combined. 
(3) Lockdowns associated with the COVID– 
19 pandemic increased the isolation of sur-
vivors of domestic violence and abusers have 
taken advantage of that isolation to further 
exert power and coercive control. 
(4) Domestic violence programs and hot-
lines across the country have seen a substan-
tial increase in contacts since the beginning 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
(5) Especially in rural areas, survivors are 
often far from shelter and services, and steps 
taken to mitigate the spread of COVID–19 
have only exacerbated that disparity. 
(6) Survivors across the country have trag-
ically experienced greater abuse and isola-
tion due to lockdowns associated with the 
COVID–19 pandemic and are in desperate 
need of increased support. 
(7) An extension of the Violence Against 
Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public 
Law 113–4; 127 Stat. 54) that lasts through 
the COVID–19 pandemic ensures that sur-
vivors can have their needs met, and ensures 
that their abusers are subjected to justice. 
(b) AUTHORITY.—Any program, authority, 
or provision, including any pilot program, 
authorized 
under 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public 
Law 113–4; 127 Stat. 54) shall continue in ef-
fect through the date that is 6 months after 
the date on which the public health emer-
gency for COVID–19, as declared by the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services under 
section 319 of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 247d), expires. 
SA 1432. Mr. MORAN (for himself and 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL) submitted an amend-
ment intended to be proposed by him 
to the bill S. 937, to facilitate the expe-
dited review of COVID–19 hate crimes, 
and for other purposes; which was or-
dered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. lll. JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Khalid Jabara and Heather 
Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, 
and Threats to Equality Act of 2021’’ or the 
‘‘Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
crimes, or crimes motivated by bias, poses a 
serious national problem. 
(2) According to data obtained by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of 
such violence increased in 2019, the most re-
cent year for which data is available. 
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate 
Crime Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 
U.S.C. 534 note) to provide the Federal Gov-
ernment, law enforcement agencies, and the 
public with data regarding the incidence of 
hate crime. The Hate Crime Statistics Act 
and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, 
Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E 
of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have en-
abled Federal authorities to understand and, 
where appropriate, investigate and prosecute 
hate crimes. 
(4) A more complete understanding of the 
national problem posed by hate crime is in 
the public interest and supports the Federal 
interest in eradicating bias-motivated vio-
lence referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of 
title 18, United States Code. 
(5) However, a complete understanding of 
the national problem posed by hate crimes is 
hindered by incomplete data from Federal, 
State, and local jurisdictions through the 
Uniform Crime Reports program authorized 
under section 534 of title 28, United States 
Code, and administered by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation. 
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the pro-
vision of inaccurate and incomplete data re-
garding the incidence of hate crime through 
the Uniform Crime Reports program. A sig-
nificant contributing factor is the quality 
and quantity of training that State and local 
law enforcement agencies receive on the 
identification and reporting of suspected 
bias-motivated crimes. 
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by 
bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and 
interstate in nature as to warrant Federal fi-
nancial assistance to States and local juris-
dictions. 
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard 
to certain violent crimes motivated by bias 
enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
to work together as partners in the inves-
tigation and prosecution of such crimes. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) HATE
CRIME.—The term ‘‘hate crime’’ 
means an act described in section 245, 247, or

IN RECOGNITION OF SANDRA L. 
FENWICK’S SERVICE AS CEO OF 
BOSTON CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL 
HON. KATHERINE M. CLARK 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Sandra 
Fenwick’s achievements as the Chief Execu-
tive Officer of Boston Children’s Hospital. Ms. 
Fenwick, known to most as Sandi, has served 
as CEO of Boston Children’s since 2013 and 
for fourteen years prior, served as the hos-
pital’s Chief Operating Officer. Sandi has led 
the hospital’s efforts to control costs and adapt 
to a changing health care environment. As 
CEO, she leads a team of 20,000 people dedi-
cated to improving and advancing child health 
through the delivery of high quality clinical 
care, advancing groundbreaking biomedical 
research, providing medical education to the 
next generation of pediatric providers and in-
vestments in the community. Boston Chil-
dren’s is the primary pediatric teaching affiliate 
for Harvard Medical School and the largest 
pediatric training program in the nation. The 
hospital is the largest pediatric research entity 
in the world. Each year, they care for children 
from all 50 states and more than 100 coun-
tries, seeing more pediatric patients with rare 
diseases and complex conditions than any 
other hospital in the world. Boston Children’s 
has been ranked the No. 1 children’s hospital 
by U.S. News and World report every single 
year since Sandi has been the CEO. 
As a Member of Congress who represents 
children and families in the Boston area, and 
as a parent myself, I am deeply grateful to 
have an institution like Boston Children’s in my 
home state. It is the leadership, provided over 
the years by Sandi Fenwick and the fantastic 
team that she has cultivated, that has led this 
institution to thrive and become one of the 
greatest resources for children in our local 
communities and around the world. 
My work with Sandi goes back many years 
to my time at the Massachusetts State House 
and more recently, here in Congress. In the 
face of growing threats to our children’s health 
and well-being, there is no better advocate for 
them than Sandi Fenwick. She has walked 
with patients and families through the State 
House and the halls of Congress, to help tell 
their stories and she has worked passionately 
behind the scenes to ensure investments in 
their care every day for years. Her voice for 
children reaches beyond the walls of the hos-
pital and indeed, beyond Boston—in particular 
through her service as the Chair of the Public 
Policy Committee of the Children’s Hospital 
Association. 
Sandi had planned to announce her retire-
ment a year ago and chose to remain at the 
helm of the hospital to see them through the 
most intense part of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
We all know what challenges that hospitals 
have faced in the past year. Under Sandi’s 
leadership, Boston Children’s has been a con-
stant presence for our children and this month, 
she leaves the institution poised and ready to 
work on the challenges of the future. I applaud 
her achievements and want to wish her well in 
her retirement and all future endeavors.

Wednesday, April 14, 2021

nandez Diaz for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Mayra A. Hernandez Diaz is a student at 
Jefferson Jr./Sr. H.S. and received this award

Hernandez Diaz is exemplary of the type of

work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of

which will guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Mayra A. Hernandez Diaz for winning the Ar-
vada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for

the same dedication and character in all of her 
future accomplishments.

HONORING 
KATIE 
HEINE 
AND 
MORGAN NOTTINGHAM UPON RE-
CEIVING THE NATIONAL MEDAL 
OF HONOR LIFESAVING AWARD 
FROM THE GIRLS SCOUTS OF 
THE USA 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize two young women from 
Norfolk, Virginia, Katie Heine and Morgan Not-
tingham, who were awarded the Medal of 
Honor—Lifesaving 
Award 
from 
the 
Girls 
Scouts of the USA. 
While setting up a booth to sell Girl Scout 
cookies, Morgan and Katie noticed a man col-
lapse nearby. Inferring that the man was hav-
ing a seizure, the two Girl Scouts sprang into 
action. Morgan rolled the man on his side and 
placed a jacket under his head to stabilize 
him. Meanwhile, Katie quickly called 911 and 
alerted a nearby security officer for assistance. 
The two young women cared for the man until 
the paramedics arrived at the scene. 
Terri Nottingham, Katie and Morgan’s troop 
leader and Morgan’s mother, credited their ex-
perience as Girl Scouts in preparing them for 
the intense situation. With the poise and brav-
ery that they displayed in such a critical mo-
ment, Morgan and Katie are more than worthy 
of the National Medal of Honor—Lifesaving 
Award. 
It is important that we recognize individuals 
in our communities who go above and beyond 
to make a difference. I am proud to represent 
these two young heroes in Congress, and I 
congratulate Katie and Morgan on receiving 
this well-deserved honor.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR 
LAURA HILL 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge the distinguished career 
of Laura Hill, the current Mayor of Southlake, 
Texas. A true model of civic leadership, Mayor 
Hill has endeavored to serve her community to 
her fullest capacity for almost two decades. As 
her second mayoral term comes to a close, it 
is my privilege to recognize her estimable ac-
complishments. 
Mayor Hill’s public service began with her 
election to the Southlake City Council in 2004. 
During her tenure on the Council, Mayor Hill 
worked to improve the quality of life for the 
citizens, especially the children, of her com-
munity. She founded the Students and Par-
ents Against Risks to our Kids (S.P.A.R.K.) or-
ganization. S.P.A.R.K. enabled Mayor Hill and 
her fellow community activists to promote 
sound public policies to safeguard the youth of 
Southlake. 
In order to promote the intellectual as well 
as the physical well-being of the children in 
her community, Mayor Hill also established 
S.A.S.O. (Scholars and Athletes Serving Oth-
ers) and S.K.I.L. (Southlake Kids Interested in 
Leadership) during her years as a City Coun-
cilwoman. With her election as Mayor in 2015, 
she has continued to promote the interests of 
the community’s youth through school safety 
initiatives, the ‘‘Mayor for the Day’’ program 
and cooperative working groups with local 
high school students. 
Mayor Hill has championed the city’s busi-
nesses and citizens with her leadership efforts 
to enhance the quality of life through sound 
fiscal management, excellent recreational of-
ferings, public improvements, promotion of 
unity and cultural diversity, and strengthening 
communication within her community during 
the pandemic through outreach programs, vir-
tual town halls, and a cohesive and coordi-
nated approach to reopening municipal gov-
ernment. Her tireless efforts in bolstering the 
efficiency and efficacy of municipal operations 
and its workforce have been invaluable to her 
constituency. 
It is with great appreciation for her tremen-
dous contributions of time and effort to 
Southlake and North Texas that I offer Mayor 
Hill congratulations on the completion of her 
second mayoral term. Her selfless devotion to-
wards the good of our community and region 
is a reflection of her compassionate service 
ethic. Mayor Laura Hill has been an exemplary 
model of civic service.

HONORING PAYNE CARR 
HON. JAMES COMER 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Mr. Payne Carr of Union 
County on his decision to serve our country 
and attend the United States Naval Academy 
at Annapolis. 
During his time at Union County High 
School, Mr. Carr excelled in the classroom 
and athletically. Among his many wrestling 
feats are winning the 2021 Kentucky State 
High School Athletic Association 152 Pound 
Wrestling Individual Championship, placing in 
three straight wrestling state tournaments, and 
leading the Union County High School Wres-
tling Team to its 6th consecutive state title this 
year. 
Mr. Carr’s discipline, strong work ethic, and 
unwavering dedication will serve him well as 
he begins this next chapter of his life. I was 
honored to nominate him for this appointment 
to the Naval Academy and am confident that 
with his commitment to leadership, he will be 
successful in his military career. 
Once again, congratulations to Mr. Payne 
Carr for this incredible accomplishment. I look 
forward to seeing his many achievements at 
the United States Naval Academy and have 
no doubt he will continue to make Union 
County and the First Congressional District of 
Kentucky proud.

strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Orville Willis for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF JOAN MCFARLAND 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Joan McFarland of River-
view on the occasion of her 100th birthday. 
Her contributions to our nation are worthy of 
commendation. 
Mrs. McFarland was born in Canton, Ohio, 
and came to Ecorse, Michigan in 1933 when 
her father got a job at Great Lakes Steel dur-
ing the Great Depression. A graduate of 
Ecorse High School, she was considered the 
class artist. At age 20, she married her hus-
band but only a week after their wedding, 
Pearl Harbor was attacked and World War II 
began. He left to serve overseas, and Mrs. 
McFarland joined Ford Motor Company to 
build aircraft engines. As a Rosie the Riveter, 
Joan’s hard work, grit, and patriotism not only 
sustained the American war effort, but paved 
a path for the next generation of working 
women. 
When her husband returned from the war in 
1947, the couple made their home in Lincoln 
Park, Michigan. Nineteen years later, the fam-
ily moved to Southgate and purchased a party 
store. Together they had five children before 
her husband passed at the age of 51. Mrs. 
McFarland is known by family and friends for 
her kind spirit and caring personality. 
A proud Rosie, she remained an active 
member of our community through her church, 
St. Pius X Catholic Church in Southgate. Her 
lifelong commitment to service in her church 
and neighborhood reminds us all of the impact 
that the Rosies have had on our state and na-
tion.

CONGRATULATING MAYOR ROY 
MCDONALD 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Mayor Roy McDonald on his re-
tirement after 26 years of faithful service to the 
citizens of the City of West Orange, Texas. 
Roy was born on June 30, 1944 in 
Glenmora, Louisiana to Jesse and Della 
McDonald and grew up in DeQuincy, Lou-
isiana. After graduating from DeQuincy High 
School in 1962, he went on to serve his coun-
try in the United States Army from 1962 
through 1965, where he earned the rank of 
Specialist 5th Class. 
Following his time in the military, Roy 
moved to Texas in 1966 to work for Dupont, 
where he remained for 32 years until his re-
tirement in 1998. It was in Orange, Texas that 
he met and married his wife LaVerne on Janu-
ary 7, 1967 and raised their children Beverly 
and Troy. His children remember fondly the 
road trips he planned for his family, how he 
mapped out every trip they took, and how he 
taught them to follow along on the map as 
they traveled across the country. His children 
remember these road trips being such fun ex-
periences that they didn’t even realize how 
their dad was teaching them at the time. 
Roy and LaVerne share a strong faith in 
God and have been faithful, lifelong members 
of McDonald Memorial Baptist Church, where 
he has served as deacon, Trustee, and Sun-
day School teacher for many years. Roy has 
also served as a member of the Gideon Inter-
national organization. 
In 1987, Roy became involved in politics by 
serving on the West Orange City Council for 
five years before becoming Mayor of West Or-
ange in May of 1995. During his time as a 
public servant, he worked on numerous local, 
regional, and state committees. Roy served on 
the Southeast Texas Regional Planning Com-
mission from 1999 to 2004, working in several 
different positions from Secretary to President. 
He also served on the Texas Association of 
Regional Councils as Chairman of the Budget 
and By-laws Committee and as President of 
the Association. In addition, he served on the 
Texas Municipal League Small Cities Advisory 
Council as Chairman. In 2002 and 2004, Roy 
was appointed by Governor Rick Perry to the 
Southeast Texas Regional Review Committee. 
During his tenure as mayor, Roy oversaw 
the construction of a new City Hall, new Fire 
and Police Stations, and numerous drainage 
and street projects. He also helped organize 
the city’s recovery efforts after several natural 
disasters, such as the ice storm in 1997, and 
as many as nine hurricanes and tropical 
storms over the last three decades. 
I wish Roy well in this next phase of life and 
have no doubt he will enjoy spending more 
time with his bride LaVerne, his daughter Bev-
erly and her husband Dr. Servet Satir, and 
with his son Troy McDonald and wife Rose, 
and especially his five grandchildren Troy 
McDonald II, Olivia Satir, Kyle McDonald, 
Micah Satir, and Megan McDonald. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
Mayor McDonald for his lifetime of dedicated 
service to the citizens of West Orange and 
wish him the very best during his well-de-
served retirement.

COMMENDING PLACE OF HOPE 
HON. BRIAN J. MAST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize an organization that is celebrating 
20 years of service to our community. Place of 
Hope has been dedicated to providing a stable 
and loving environment for children, youth, 
and families that are suffering from abuse, ne-
glect, homelessness, and human trafficking. 
Place of Hope has served over 17,000 chil-
dren, youth, and families in our community 
over the past 20 years. To date, a remarkable 
320 ‘‘forever families’’ have been created via 
adoption. They are the largest, most diverse, 
residential children and families organization in 
Palm Beach County and on the Treasure 
Coast. Moreover, because of their work, more 
than 40,000 community members have been 
educated about human trafficking. 
Organizations like Place of Hope are indis-
pensable to making the world and community 
a better place, so I congratulate them on their 
20 years of service and wish them continuing 
success in the future.

SAMANTHA BOWES 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Samantha 
Bowes for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Samantha Bowes is a student at Drake Mid-
dle School and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Samantha 
Bowes is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Samantha Bowes for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt she will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments.

RECOGNIZING MOUNT LAUREL 
CHIEF JOHN COLUCCI 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Chief John M. Colucci of 
the Mount Laurel Fire Department on his 
twenty-five years of service to Mount Laurel 
and to congratulate Chief Colucci on his 
much-deserved retirement. 
A beloved son of New Jersey, Chief Colucci 
returned to New Jersey to begin his career in 
the fire service in 1994, after serving in the 
Navy. While in the Navy, he was awarded the 
National Defense Service Medal, the Sea 
Service Deployment Ribbon, the Southwest 
Asia Service Medal with Bronze Star, the 
Armed Forces Joint Expeditionary Medal, the 
Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Battle ‘‘E’’ 
Award and the Kuwait Liberation Medal. 
Throughout his twenty-five years as a fire-
fighter in New Jersey, Chief Colucci contrib-
uted greatly to the town of Mount Laurel and 
New Jersey. During his time as Chief of De-
partment, Chief Colucci was dedicated to im-
proving safety and quality of life for firefighters 
and the residents of Mount Laurel Township. 
Among his many achievements, Chief Colucci 
improved the department’s ISO rating from a 
Class 4 to a Class 3, fully implemented a 24- 
hour staffing plan to increase fire safety and 
oversaw upgrades in technology, firefighting 
equipment and the firefighter bailout system. 
Chief Colucci also founded the Mount Laurel 
Firefighters Foundation, 501c3, served as 
Scholarship Chair of the Burlington County 
Fire Chiefs Associations, and served as Presi-
dent of the New Jersey Career Fire Chiefs As-
sociation from 2018 to 2020. 
I commend Chief Colucci for his work, and 
I know I speak on behalf of my constituents 
when I say Chief Colucci will be missed.

OSCAR DE LA ROSA 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Oscar De La 
Rosa for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Oscar De La Rosa is a student at Jefferson 
Jr./Sr. H.S. and received this award because 
his determination and hard work have allowed 
him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Oscar De 
La Rosa is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Oscar De La Rosa for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt he will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of his fu-
ture accomplishments.

IN RECOGNITION OF ELIZABETH 
WAKNUK’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Elizabeth Waknuk of Bellingham, 
Washington on the occasion of her 100th 
birthday. Mrs. Waknuk migrated to the United 
States in 1954 from Canada. With her family, 
she moved to the United States with only 
$200 in hand and worked hard to start a life 
here while raising her four children. Until re-
tirement, she worked as a supervisor for 
housekeeping at the University of Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Elizabeth Waknuk on her 
100th birthday. She has raised a wonderful 
and caring family, who I join in extending my 
heartfelt well wishes on this special occasion.

HONORING BOB PHILLIPS III 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate my longtime friend Bob 
Phillips III who went to be with his Savior on 
March 5, 2021. As we reflect on his extraor-
dinary life, my thoughts and prayers are with 
his family and friends during this difficult time. 
Blessed with a fierce intellect, Bob excelled 
at law school and went on to become one of 
Texas’ premier attorneys. As a retired judge, 
I’ve seen many lawyers in practice and Bob, 
a tireless advocate for his clients, was one of 
the best. 
His was a life of devotion to causes bigger 
than himself. I was blessed to share a Bible 
study with Bob where he taught, rejoiced in, 
and worked to make the lessons of the gospel 
attainable to all. Like his beloved Savior, Bob 
did not come to be served, but to serve, and 
the teachings of Christ guided Bob throughout 
his life. While I miss him here on Earth, I know 
he is in Heaven with the Son of Man who 
gave his life as a ransom for many. 
Bob never shied away from coaching little 
leaguers or future attorneys and always re-
joiced in thoughtful debate and good con-
versation. Throughout their joyous relationship, 
Bob and Jeanne, the love of his life, lived, 
loved, and prospered as one. Proud parents of 
five children and grandparents of seven, they 
kept family at the center of their lives. Bob’s 
love of the game of baseball and his zeal for 
the gospel of Jesus Christ were two of the 
many legacies Bob passed down to his chil-
dren, grandchildren, and so many others who 
were blessed to know him. 
While I join Bob Phillips’ family and friends 
in mourning his passing, the positive impacts 
he had on the lives of others will remain in our 
hearts forever. 
CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF 
COACH STEVE JENKINS 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the historic career of Evangel Univer-
sity’s longtime Men’s Basketball coach Steve 
Jenkins. 
After graduating summa cum laude as a 
student athlete from Evangel in 1974, Coach 
Jenkins returned to the school in 1977 as an 
assistant basketball coach. From 1978 to 
1983, he served as head coach for the Univer-
sity’s baseball team, earning a record of 132– 
97–3. He also served as head coach of the 
golf team from 1998 to 2016, bringing the pro-
gram its first conference championship, and 
winning Heart Coach of the Year in 2010 and 
2012. His role as head coach of the basketball 
team has been his longest, taking over in 
1982 and serving in that position ever since. 
During his tenure, Coach Jenkins has posted 
a record of 692–542 (.561) and has won 7 
Heart of America Conference Championships, 
while competing in the NAIA Tournament 13 
times. His team won the National Title in 
2002, with a record of 35–l. He has been 
named Heart Conference Coach of the Year 7 
times and won NAIA Coach of the Year in 
2002. 
Coach Jenkins record goes beyond wins 
and losses. A total of 24 of his former players 
have been named first-team All-Heart Con-
ference, with 6 earning the league’s Player of 
the Year award, along with 2 Freshman of the 
Year nominees, 4 Newcomer of the Year win-
ners, and one Defensive Player of the Year 
Recipient. He has also coached 33 NAIA All- 
American players. As coach of the baseball 
team, 5 players won All-District honors, includ-
ing the first NAIA All-American and Academic 
All-American in program history. More than 30 
of his former players and staff members have 
gone on to hold coaching positions across the 
nation. This is a testament to the true teacher 
and mentor that Coach Jenkins is. 
In 2014, Coach Jenkins was inducted to the 
NAIA Hall of Fame, the second inductee from 
Evangel. This followed his induction to the 
Evangel Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006, the 
Millwood Golf and Racquet Club Hall of Fame 
and Springfield Area Sports Hall of Fame in 
2011, and the Missouri Basketball Coaches 
Association Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2016, he 
was inducted to the Missouri Sports Hall of 
Fame. 
Madam Speaker, Coach Jenkins has proven 
his incredible leadership and coaching skills, 
and I wish him and his family a happy retire-
ment.

Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

The We The People program helps students 
develop in-depth understanding of the Con-
stitution through building their understanding 
of civic duty, teaching valuable research skills, 
and expanding their knowledge of government 
and its inner-workings. 
Ensuring a better future for Southwest Con-
necticut requires our students to be able to ar-
ticulate a vision for our country that reflects 
the basic principles in the Constitution that we 
revere. Staples High School’s We The People 
team’s success is proof of how our Constitu-
tion’s principles and values will be carried on 
by ambitious and passionate future genera-
tions. I am proud that several of Connecticut’s 
state champions come from the Fourth Con-
gressional District, with Staples High School 
included in those ranks. Later this April, the 
Staples We The People will compete in the 
National Finals against teams across the

HONORING THE CORPUS CHRISTI 
ARMY DEPOT (CCAD) 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD) 
as it celebrates 60 years of operations as the 
premier rotary winged helicopter repair and 
maintenance facility for the United States 
Army. Established on March 10, 1961 as the 
U.S. Army Transportation Aeronautical Depot 
Maintenance Center (ARADMAC), Naval Air 
Station, Corpus Christi, it was accepted by the 
U.S. Army on April 21, 1961 and officially re- 
designated as the CCAD in 1974. 
CCAD has become a critical asset in Army 
readiness since helicopters first took center 
stage of combat operations during the Viet-
nam War. Throughout Corpus Christi and the 
Rio Grande Valley, the names Huey, Chinook, 
Black Hawk, and Apache evoke pride in our 
Veterans, active duty personnel, and retired 
service members and civilians alike, whether 
in war or peacetime. Members of CCAD 
served valiantly on the USNS Corpus Christi 
Bay (formerly the USS Albemarle) during the 
Vietnam War as the Army’s sole floating main-
tenance depot and saved time, money, and 
lives during the conflict. 
Thousands of troops and civilian contractors 
have walked the halls, worked in the hangars, 
turned the wrenches, flown the aircraft and 
dedicated themselves to the operation of 
CCAD since 1961. Their commitment to the 
mission of the United States Army safeguards 
the freedom and security that citizens of the 
United States enjoy today. 
I am proud to honor CCAD, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing and 
showing deep appreciation for the service of 
all personnel of the CCAD, past, present, and 
future. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, 
like a battle-hardened soldier, CCAD remains 
strong, committed, and dedicated to ‘‘Keep the 
Army Flying’’.

student-athletes who work together to achieve 
great things. It takes a tremendous amount of 
hard work, practice, and teamwork to reach 
this level of success, and those qualities 
abound in this team. 
In a basketball season like no other, this ac-
complishment was hard-fought, and it reflects 
the dedication of each and every player, the 
leadership of Coach Scott Drew and the 
team’s entire coaching and support staff as 
well as all their families and friends. 
An achievement such as this does not hap-

ance, and ultimately success in bringing a 
championship home to Baylor. 
As a former Bear, I could not be prouder.

Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Romely 
Carreon for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Romely Carreon is a student at Drake Mid-
dle School and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Romely 
Carreon is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Romely Carreon for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CONTRIBU-
TIONS AND GENEROSITY OF MR. 
NICOLA BULGARI 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to celebrate and give gratitude to Mr. Nicola 
Bulgari, an avid connoisseur of American- 
made cars and gracious contributor to the 
LeMay—America’s Car Museum in Washing-
ton’s 6th Congressional District. 
Mr. Bulgari was born and raised in Rome, 
Italy and as a young boy, became fascinated 
with American cars. He promised himself that 
when he grew up, he would own an American 
car. This boyhood goal grew into supporting a 
dream that the United States would have a 
national entity dedicated to the heritage that 
the automobile brought to American life. 
Through his extensive efforts and commitment 
to helping others who share his passion, that 
dream has become a reality. In 2004, Mr. 
Bulgari joined the Board of Directors for the 
LeMay—America’s Car Museum and devoted 
himself to the effort which led to its opening in 
Tacoma, Washington in 2012. 
Most recently, in January 2021, Mr. Bulgari 
carried out the partnership between the NB 
Center for American Automotive Heritage and 
America’s Automotive Trust based in Tacoma, 
WA. The Trust is committed to honoring the 
past, celebrating the present, and anticipating 
the future of American automotive legacy. 
We are extraordinarily fortunate to have 
seen firsthand the generosity of Mr. Bulgari in 
our region. His devotion to the American auto-
mobile heritage will have a lasting impression 
on Washingtonians and visitors from all 
around the country and world. I have the great 
privilege of recognizing his impact here in the 
United States Congress.

IN 
CELEBRATION 
OF 
PATRICIA 
‘‘PATTIE’’ 
MANSUR’S 
SERVICE 
TO 
KANSAS 
CITY 
PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with immense appreciation for Patricia 
‘‘Pattie’’ Mansur’s years of service to the stu-
dents and community of Kansas City, Missouri 
as a member of the Kansas City Public School 
Board. Over the last several years, Pattie has 
demonstrated the passion, integrity, and deter-
mination that we hope the students whom she 
served will emulate as they become leaders in 
their own right. 
Pattie’s time on the School Board is a testa-
ment to what can be accomplished when con-
cerned citizens engage with their community 
to overcome difficult issues. When Pattie en-
rolled her children into Kansas City Public 
Schools (KCPS), she recognized that its 
teachers and students were burdened as a 
consequence of dwindling revenues, inequi-
table opportunities, and transient leadership. 
Instead of simply lamenting those problems, 
Pattie set about building coalitions, engaging 
the community, and eventually, winning an at- 
large seat on the School Board. During her 
time in office, Pattie worked hard to build a 
strong foundation that future School Boards 
will expand upon for years to come. She 
helped recruit Dr. Mark Bedell, an adminis-
trator dedicated to equality in education, to 
serve as the superintendent. Dr. Bedell, along 
with Pattie and other Board members, secured 
the stability and leadership necessary for the 
district to implement a one-of-a-kind equity 
policy that has provided additional resources 
to chronically underfunded schools. Pattie also 
worked to increase the number of AP and 
dual-credit courses offered across KCPS high 
schools, ensuring that all students had the 
ability to earn college credit while attending 
high school. She engaged with private busi-
nesses to build and renovate existing fields, 
stadiums, and other venues so that every stu-
dent has the opportunity to participate in 
sports and other extra-curricular activities. 
Recognizing that we communicate our values 
by how we spend our dollars, Pattie fought for 
increased teacher pay and further investment 
in new technologies that have helped edu-
cators connect with the next generation of stu-
dents. As the district celebrated noticeable im-
provements in graduation rates and college 
readiness, she was a champion in the fight for 
full accreditation from the Missouri Department 
of Early and Secondary Education. Inspired by 
their mother’s advocacy and her dedication to 
serving Kansas City’s students, one of Pattie’s 
three beloved children is now a teacher in the 
KCPS system. These accomplishments not 
only had a positive impact on children cur-
rently enrolled in KCPS, but will also continue 
to generate equitable opportunities for the next 
generations of KCPS students. 
In addition to her stellar efforts on the 
School Board, Pattie has further served the 
Kansas City community through a number of 
non-profit organizations. She continues to 
serve as the Director of Health Policy and 
Communications for the REACH Healthcare 
Foundation, which works to improve access to 
healthcare for uninsured and underserved 
communities. As Director, she’s advocated for 
policies in both Jefferson City and Wash-
ington, D.C. that would address systemic and 
deeply rooted inequities in the healthcare sys-
tem. Recently, her tireless work at REACH 
helped the organization mobilize 29 local 
healthcare providers in an effort to strengthen 
the community’s fight against the coronavirus 
pandemic. The REACH Foundation, and by 
extension those the foundation serves, has 
benefitted immensely from Pattie’s three dec-
ades of proven leadership in the non-profit 
sector. 
Marian Wright Edelman, a renowned advo-
cate for children and founder of the Children’s 
Defense Fund, once elegantly noted that 
working in education comes with a momen-
tous duty to improve the lives of others and 
leave your community better than you found it. 
As Pattie’s time on the School Board con-
cludes, she can rest assured that KCPS stu-
dents have more opportunities, are suc-
ceeding at higher rates, and have brighter fu-
tures because of her efforts. Madam Speaker, 
please join me in extending heartfelt and sin-
cere congratulations to Pattie Mansur on a 
successful and accomplished tenure on the 
Kansas City Public School Board. Further-
more, let us renew our commitment to stu-
dents as we strengthen our nation by investing 
in equitable, inclusive, and innovative public 
schools.

HONORING BENNETT J. THOMAS

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Bennett J. Thom-
as. Bennett is a very special young man who 
has exemplified the finest qualities of citizen-
ship and leadership by taking an active part in 
the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 180, and 
earning the most prestigious award of Eagle 
Scout. 
Bennett has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Bennett has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Bennett J. Thomas for his 
accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

HONORING DREW BREES’S RETIRE-
MENT 
FROM 
THE 
NATIONAL 
FOOTBALL LEAGUE 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Drew Brees, his legacy as a New Or-
leans Saint in the National Football League, 
and his dedication to the people of the City of 
New Orleans. Drew’s retirement comes after 
completing twenty seasons in the NFL, fifteen 
of which were played as the starting quarter-
back of my hometown team, the New Orleans 
Saints. In fact, he chose to retire on March 14, 
2021, the fifteen-year anniversary of his sign-
ing with the Saints. 
Since 2005, Drew has taken the field 
dressed in black and gold and sparked the 
greatest era yet for the Saints franchise. For 
the last fifteen years, Brees has led one of the 
most explosive offensive teams in NFL history, 
marching the Saints to seven NFC South titles 
and winning the franchise’s first-ever Super 
Bowl in 2010. You can take a guess who the 
MVP was for Super Bowl XLIV. 
I could go on and on about how Drew Brees 
is one of the best football players of all time. 
How he is the NFL all-time leader in career 
passing yards, passes completed, passes 
completed per game, and total offensive 
yards. Or that he has the most seasons with 
5,000+ passing yards, has been selected for 
13 Pro Bowls, or that he has showcased his 
accuracy by holding the all-time single season 
record for his passing completion percentage 
at 74.4 percent. These achievements are un-
paralleled. In addition to Drew’s accomplish-
ments on the field, I also want to recognize 
and honor the positive impact Drew Brees has 
made on New Orleans and the entire State of 
Louisiana. 
Drew came to New Orleans during one of 
our darkest times. Hurricane Katrina had taken 
over 1,800 lives and flooded the vibrant, his-
toric crown jewel of the South. The iconic Lou-
isiana Superdome, home to the Saints and 
regularly filled with cheering fans on Sundays, 
was filled with many of those same people 
who were now evacuees, some of whom had 
lost everything they owned. 
The Saints are more than just a football 
team in New Orleans. After Katrina, the Saints 
gave us hope. The Saints are as much a part 
of the soul of New Orleans as our world-fa-
mous cuisine and the jazz music and brass 
bands that fill the French Quarter. Drew Brees 
changed our New Orleans Saints forever, 
bringing historic success to the franchise and 
giving the city hope, with something to finally 
celebrate through the grueling struggles of re-
building. As the Saints organization put it, 
Drew came to us at our lowest point, and 
brought us to its highest. 
A known leader in the locker room, Drew is 
also a leader off the field. Winner of the NFL’s 
Walter Payton Man of the Year award, Drew 
and his wife Brittany founded the Brees 
Dream Foundation, which has contributed 
more than $45 million globally to cancer pa-
tients and families in need. In the last year, 
the Brees family personally committed $5 mil-
lion to Louisiana to assist with COVID–19 re-
lief efforts. 
To close, I’d like to read Brees’ own inspira-
tional words from his retirement letter, ad-
dressed openly to the city and to the famed 
Who Oat Nation. ‘‘From the moment I stepped 
foot into the city of New Orleans, I could feel 
your spirit. You told me that if I loved New Or-
leans, you would love me back. No truer 
words have ever been spoken. ‘‘Drew, I 
wholeheartedly agree, and your place in the 
history of the city will live forever. Jennifer and 
I wish you, Brittany, and your beautiful young 
kids all the best as you now begin the next 
chapter of your Hall of Fame life. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR OF NI-

BOUSLEY’S, 
DISTINGUISHED CAREER 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in honor of the career and service of retir-
ing City of Niagara Mayor, George Bousley. 
Mayor Bousley has had a long and es-
teemed career in public service. He was first 
elected as the Mayor of Niagara in 1989 and 
held the position for 32 consecutive years. He 
also served 12 years on the Marinette County 
Board, with 8 years as the County Board 
Chair. 
Throughout his service to Niagara and 
Marinette County, Mayor Bousley lead and 
contributed to countless projects and initiatives 
that will surely benefit Northeast Wisconsin for 
years to come. Colleagues of Mayor Bousley 
have praised him for his humility, dedication, 
open mindedness, and hard work, all of which 
will be missed as his tenure as Mayor of Niag-
ara comes to an end. 
Mayor Bousley has accomplished much dur-
ing his time in public service, and truly per-
sonifies the generous spirit that Northeast 
Wisconsin is known for. From his work on the 
U.S. 141 project, to Niagara’s Centennial 
Celebration, Mayor Bousley worked tirelessly 
for his community. 
Mayor George Bousley will certainly be 
missed by the people of Niagara, and I com-
mend him for his dedication to his community. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in applauding Mayor Bousley 
for his service.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF

HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Claire Cullen Earley, a San 
Carlos, California resident, who died on March 
28, 2021, Palm Sunday, at the age of 85. 
Claire Cullen was born on May 29, 1935, in 
Larchmont, New York, to Colonel William Jo-
seph Cullen and Alice Cunningham Cullen. 
She was raised in Larchmont and Manhattan 
and earned a degree in Mathematics from 
Rosemont College. She worked as a computer 
programmer at Union Carbide in New York 
City where she met and later married Martin 
Vincent Earley. In 1971 they moved to San 
Carlos, where she began her lifelong commit-
ment to her community. 
Claire Earley was the former President of 
the San Mateo County Association of Real-
tors, Director of the California Association of 
Realtors, a member of St. Charles Church in 
San Carlos and the San Carlos Rotary Club. 
She was predeceased by her husband Mar-
tin and her parents. She leaves her four be-
loved sons and their wives, and 11 adored 
grandchildren. She will be sorely missed by 
each of them as well as the many people who 
were blessed by her loyalty and generosity. I 
was blessed with her friendship for almost five 
decades.

HONORING MAYOR JAMES ‘JIM’ 
DARLING 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mayor 
James ‘Jim’ Darling on the occasion of his re-
tirement. Mayor Darling faithfully served the 
City of McAllen, Texas for 43 years and will 
close out his tenure as mayor this May. 
Mayor Darling was born in Rochester, New 
York, and then selflessly joined the U.S. Air 
Force. He completed two tours in Vietnam 
with the U.S. Air Force as a staff sergeant and 
eventually earned the rank of 2nd Class Petty 
Officer for the U.S. Navy Reserve. 
Mayor Darling initially came to Texas to at-
tend Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where 
he obtained his bachelor’s and law degree. 
After Baylor, he moved to McAllen, Texas, 
where his love for the community kept him for 
over 40 years. Mayor Darling spent 28 years 
as city attorney for the City of McAllen and 
other government entities. He also served as 
the District 6 City Commissioner for two terms 
before being elected as Mayor of McAllen in 
2013. 
During Darling’s two terms as Mayor, he 
was devoted to expanding educational oppor-
tunities and investing in public safety and in-
frastructure in McAllen and the entire Rio 
Grande Valley. He was deeply involved in the 
establishment of the University of Texas Rio 
Grande Valley (UTRGV) Medical School, 
UTRGV Research Center and a Texas A&M 
University campus, attracting future profes-
sionals to the area. He also oversaw the 
merger of the Valley’s three Metropolitan Plan-
ning Organizations and spearheaded key road 
and traffic improvements, an expansion of the 
city police department, an expansion of 
McAllen International Airport, and the con-
struction of a new fire department. 
Under Mayor Darling’s leadership, the city 
also saw stadium improvements, park devel-
opments, and the construction of the McAllen 
Performing Arts Center. Mayor Darling also 
fought to bring broadband for underserved 
neighborhoods and worked with Catholic 
Charities of the Rio Grande Valley to open the 
Humanitarian Respite Center. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mayor 
Darling for his leadership and more than four 
decades of service to the City of McAllen. 
While he credits many for his accomplish-
ments, it takes a true leader to make a dif-
ference of this magnitude. He serves as both 
a light in our community and a role model. It 
is an honor to represent a dedicated public 
servant like Jim Darling. I wish Mayor Darling, 
my good friend, the best in his future endeav-
ors.
